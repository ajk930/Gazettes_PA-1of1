CON G R E S 5.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, May 16.
(Concluded from yejlerday 1 s Gazette.)
Mr. Harper said he fliould not employ a
great deal of time in anfvvering what had fal
len from the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. Gallatin) because he conceived that his
arguments were so much at war with each o
ther, so contradictory, and lo palpably ab
surd, that it was scarcely necelfary to bring
them into view to refute them.
But he would make a few observations on
the ground of expediency. As to the ground
of constitutionality, gentlemen mult excuse
him if he laid lie did n*t jhink them serious
in their objections oa that head. It appear
ed to him as if what was said on this part of
the subject was one of those excursions which
gentlei(ien are apt to take, when they have
nothing material to fay. He Ihould therefore
treat this argument in the only way in which
he could treat it, except it were with ridicule,
by palling it over in silence.
Two objections have been urged againlt
this measure, on the ground of expediency.
One is, that this force, when organized, will
differ in no respeCt from ordinary militia, and
therefore will not be more effective; the o
ther is, that it will be extremely dangerous to
the liberties of the country,
i Mr. H. said he had often heard (landing ar
| mies railed against, from the days of Pultney
to the present time ; it was a fine fubjeit tor
popular declamation, and was therefore often
embraced, when an orator wiftied to make a
speech for the public ear j but it was reserved
tor this day and for this motion, to discover,
not that (landing armies of mercenary troops
are dangerous to the liberties of a country,
but that armed citizens are dangerous to its
liberties. Gentlemen now hear, forthefirfl:
time, that they cannot trull their own bre
thren, their lons, their dearest relations âthe
Youth of the country ; that generous Youth
who come forward and lay that they are rea
dy to lay open their breads to receive the firft
wounds which are inflicted upon their coun
try. Certain gentlemea to fee
this corps of generous Youth, and represent
them as a force not to be trufljed. Why ?, Be
cause it will prove dangerous to liberty. To
the liberty ot insurgents and the seditious,
Mr. H. believed this force would be danger- i
ous. The gentleman trom Pennsylvania, no
doubt, recollects how extremely dangerous \
volunteer corps are to liberties of this kind,
though he did not know that this recollection !
produced any part of the antipathy which he j
now (hews to the proposed establishment,
though he could fee a natural cause for it, I
as it went to put a hook in the nose of insur
gents ; of those who wilh to overturn the go- I
vernmenf. In this he could find a natural
cause of aversion in that gentieman agaisit I
tinared allfociations of citizens which iire the
natural defence of republican governments.
It was because these allocations are danger
ous to the fpeciesof liberty which he had de
scribed that Mr. H. was in favour of them ;
because they are dangerous to thajt foe, those ;
perturbators of mankind, who are not con- !
tent with destroying our commerce, hut who 1
threaten to deltroy all tlvit are held sacred in ]
this country âour government, all our valua- ]
ble institutions, our laws âour liberty.
But, said Mr. H. we are told that no dan
ger exists; and when we wilh to put arms in
to the hands of our citizens, and speak of
danger, we are charged with introducing a
system of alarm, by which this country will
be brought intoa funilar fituatidn with that or i
another country. The gentleman from Penn
sylvania mentioned England, and deplored
the effeCt which alarm had produced there.
He believed be did deplore it, because if put
an effectual check to difafteCtion and di{or
ganization j it alio put a check to French
principles and French arms, and this he be
lieved that gentleman regretted. On the con
trary he himfelf rejoiced in this; because he
thought the effect of it had been happy, and
he believed nothing else would have laved
England from deltrnCtton. It was on this
account that he wifhedto fee tha fame system
of alarm exist here. What has been the ef
fect in England ? It has brought forward the
people, the cultivators of the foil, the pof
ieflfors of property; they have taken arms in
their hands, and rallied round their govern
ment. They have said, 44 though our go
vernment is not the belt in the world ; tho'
ours is not the highest lot of happiness which ,
exists, yet it is hapjnnefs in the extreme when
compared with that which threatens our ex
istence." They have therefore armed them
selves, and the friends of France in that coun
try have been put down. And how was this
effected? By the system of alarm, of which
the gentleman from Pennsylvania complains ;
notwithstanding the foporifics which were
there continually held out to induce the go
vernment to acta contrary part, by men who
cried out Peace, Peace ! to hood-wink the
community. This system of alarm had, how
ever opened their eyes. It will, said Mr. H.
have the fame effeit here, ifkept up only ; it
will preserve us from foreign invasion and in
ternal enemies.
It is denied, by those who either do not fee
the danger, or who have succeeded in lulling
themselves and others to deep, that the dan
ger exists, and they wilh the alarm to cease.
indeed, he ftiould tremble for the fate
of his country; then Ihould he think the
doors were open to foreigninfhience, domestic
insurreCtion, and plunder; then Ihould he ex
peCt to fee the Legislature of the country go
out to welcome French Commiftioners, and
receive orders from their hands ; bftt, whilst
this alarm exists, he ftiould apprehend no
danger, he ftiould resist these opiates, and en
deavour to draw aside the veil which the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania and others endea
vour to spread before the eyes of the people.
Indeed, he believed the rights and liberties
ef the people of this country reft on a final 1
pivot, which was to be found in the present
well-founded alarm, and a flight stroke of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania might easi
ly overturn the whole.
But even if that gentleman were to succeed
in blinding this Houle, it would not be in his
power to blUd the people. They will defend
themselves. If Congress ftiould be so blind
to their interest, as not to lend their aid toor
ganize these volunteer citizens for their de
fence, he hoped and trusted they would not
be forgetful of their duty.
But the gentleman from Pennfylvaniacom
plains that these volunteers are not made a
part of the militia, and denies that they will

be any thing superior. Why then does he
quarrel with the institution ? If it did not give
a more effectual defence against either an in
ternal or external enemy, why does it offend
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and his
supporters? He thought their didike of it
the best proof which could be adduced in its
favour. They acknowledge that these corps
will have strength, nerve and force. The on
ly question is about directing it ; and thÂ«y are
afraid of a pollible direction of it. It was his
wifli to have it so organized as that it might
ad ; and whenever the fame crilis fha 11 exist
that has existed in Ireland, and such as has
threatened England, he would cajl all this
force into a<stion. Whenever an Executive
Directory (hall be fittkng, and a day lhall have
been fixed for affaffmating the Aristocrats, or
all those who do not concur in the principles
of French Democracy, then he Ihould wilh
this force to be turned agamft these persons.
He believed, however, this time was far off,
and he believed the formidable nature of this
force would effectually prevent its arrival.
If, said Mr. H. there be no dangers of this
kind ; if there be no persons disposed to ex
cite infurrettions; no persons ready to aid a
foreign foe, and rally round a foreign standard,
and no invasion takes place, there will be no
thing for these volunteers to be called upon
to do; they will have cost nothing, and 110
inconvenience will arile from having had them
ia readineis.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania fays,
the militia are equal to the quelling of infur
reftions, and adduces the western inlurrection
as a proof of it. But was it not known that
means were taken to damp and pally the spi
rit of the Militia in that affair, which effect
was not removed until after the volunteers
came forward j and this was one of the crimes
of which the volunteers were guilty, and it
was a fin which cannot be pardoned or for
gotten by that'gentleman, but it Wbs one of
those things which endeared volunteer corps
to him. And unless the gentleman from
Pennsylvania could convince him that the
people will feel themselves less secure when
they fee a large force in the counttry, han
when they have norie, he Ihould not believe
that the eftablilhment of this corps could
produee a bad effect upon the miritia. On
the contrary, he believed it would excite em
ulation in the militia. They will fay, we will ;
not fuffer these ftripplings to get all the lati- |
rels. This spirit will begin with the moftac- 1
tive, but it will spread througli the whole of ,
the community.
Gentlemen speak of this as a permaneht |
corps. This is contrary to the provisions of :
this bill; if not, it might be ealily limited.
And what will happen after these volunteers
lhall return from service ? Will they disor
ganize the militia, by carrying with them j
home a knowledge of arms and military duty? :
He believed a very contrary effeft would be
produced. He was persuaded they would i
carry home with them to the militia those
materials out of which soldiers only can be
made.
As to the idea of thele volunteers being re
ftri&ed to certain classes of persons, it is too
contemptible for serious notice. Can it be
believed that the independent citizens of this
country, because they are not rich, cannot
provide themselves with the necessary arms
and accoutrements of a volunteer? No ; they
will fay, " though we are not so rich as our
neighbours, we are rich enough to buy our
arms and military coat." He had seen the
militia act in this manner in the town where
he lived ; and though they had expensive uni
forms and equipments, the spirit spread, and
men of all delcriptions, from the most weal
thy, to those who worked for their daily fub
liftenre, provided themselves with them. And
he could not believe that any American, who
| polfeffes his health, and liberty, was so poor
1 as%not so be able to provide himfelf with the
( necessary arms and uniform to become a vol
; unteer. Yet gentlemen chose to insinuate,
| that this was a plan to arm the rich against the
poor. Who dare talk to the people of Ame
! Rica of their poverty ? It is an inapplicable
j phrase in this country. As he had already
said, every man could afford to become a vo
lunteer ; the will only was necessary; and that
will, he was persuaded, was ready, if not
damped by the motion of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania.
The modifications of which the clause is
susceptible, he would not point out j but if
there was any which could be agreed to, with
! out cutting up the principle of the feftion,
! lie Ihould be ready to assent to it; but be-
I cause the details of the fe&ion do not please
gentlemen, is that a good reason for striking
out the feÂ£tion itfeU? Certainly not; in the
language of the gentleman from N. Jersey it
is another instance ot the unfair proceedings
by which every stage of this bill had been
combated and oppoled.
Mr. Gallatin and Mr. Brooks rose
together. The latter had the preference.
Mr. Brooks fuppoled, that by this time
the committee would have been ready for the
question. He did not himfelf intend to have
said any thing upon it ; but feeing the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania ready to rake the
floor again, he would fir ft fay a feÂ»v words
upon it, that that gentleman might have an
opportunity ot remarking upon what he said
alio. 1 hat gentleman had gone through a la
byrinth of opposition to every measure of de
fence ; he believed he mult now be come
pretty nearly to a conclusion. He could not
refufe, indeed, an appropriation for the torts
and harbours, but that was -Very confined ;
but he had fuccellively oppoled all the other
mealuresot defence. The Naval Armament,
he was certain would produce war, tho' uow he
insists upon it that there is no danger of war, yet
he himfelf had advices this day of veffelsof the
enemy being in the harbour of New York,
that they had taken two vessels there and that
they were ready to point their guns upon us.
Iha Provisional Army, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania opposed in every fiiape ; and now
he attacks the Volunteer corps which seems to
be his last point. These volunteer corps he
cannot bear the name of. Why? Because
they (hew the spirit of the people, more than
any other measure. Government will now
find who are willing to defend the country.
1 his lure!y was not the reason why he objected
to it; and yet a stranger would be apt to
think so. He would venture to fay one thing,
however, that if the French Directory had had
an agent 011 this floor to have pled their cause,
he could not, hay e done it more effectually
than the gentleman from pennsylvania ; and
that gentleman may certainly have this conso
lation, that if, by any fortuitous circumstance,
he fliould be driven from this happy country,
he will certainly be received in another, with
a cry of " Well done, good and faithful ferianty i
enter thou into the arms of the Directory." i
The gentleman had confidently laid, that .
there is no danger to be apprehended from an (
invasion, because he was convinced the citi
zens ot this country would fuffer no foreigner '
who comes with hostile views, long to exifton
ourfhores; but Mr. B. believed the way to
be fafe, was ftot the course of (fitting dill and
folding our arms, recommended by that gen
tleman, supposing danger at adiltance. It we
fliould be found in such a situation we may
expect to be overtaken with danger, as with
a whirlwind. He had fa id much of the chear
ful fubmiiTion of the people to the saws. He
was himfelf glad to hear it ; though he be
lieved it was more from a principle of fear,
than love, in certain quarters of the Union.
But the gentleman from Penafylvania fays,
there is no danger to be apprehended from in
surrection, or from peffons in this country
joining the standard of any enemy who may
attack us ; but, (aid he, we have better au
thority than the word of that gentleman to
believe the contrary. The Executive Direc
tory have said, that they have diplomatic
agents hereâthat they have them in abun
dance ; so that they are better acquainted
with the situation of things here, than that
gentleman is willing to believe, or to admit.
He himfelf believed the faft, to a cerjain ex
tent; and the beftwayof guarding again ft dan
ger is to be ready to repel it.Even in this city,
ona late occafioil,afeeble oppofitionof foolilh
men, mounted the French cockade, and de
clared that when the French troops came,
they would join them, Foolilh men ! he cal
j led them, for he apprehended they had dis
covered the truth too soon ; and trifling as
this may seem, he was of opinion that these
men only spoke what they heard, and that
these things did not originate with themselves.
But the gentleman lays, that if these vo
lunteers are permitted toarm and equip them
selves, it will difguftthe Militia. Little does
that gentleman knovy of the spirit of this
country. Had he been here at the beginning
| ottlie Revolution, he would have seen men
1 of a different description. He never knew any
I jealouly amongst our soldiers or militia, be
j cause one looked a little smarter than another.
I At the present time, indeed he believed, if the
| gentleman from Pennsylvania would go out
; on a review day, he would fee part of the
Militia of this State, as well as others, in uni
i form, and part in common clothes, without
! any disagreeable feelings being entertained
j on that account.
Mr. B. concluded with faying, that as the
I day was far advanced, he would not take up
any longer the time of the committee than to
fah, tnat either the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania does not understand the fubjeÂ£t, or his
I reasoning is peculiar to himlelf.
Mr. Gallatin said, he fliould difappolnt
the member from New-Yoik, in some de
gree, as he exprefTed an expedition that
he (Mr. G.) fliould answer what might
fall from him ; but whea a member so far
abandoned every rule of common decency,
so far forgot the refpeft due to this house and
so farinfulted the understanding of members,
as to pay no attention to the question under
discussion, but laying argument aside, goes
merely into a wide fieidof abusive declamati
tion, he conceived him entitled only toftknt
contempt, and that and that alone the mem
ber from New-York would receive from him.
The gentleman from South-Carolina, Mr.
G. said. had not made any reply to the lead
ing arguments urged against the fetlion un
der eonfideration.
He would once mereafk whence arose tV.e
particular partiality which is (hewn to the
proposed organization of these corps ? Are
gentlemen afraid that the present militia offi
cers will not be so good as those appoin ed by
the Prcfid- nt of the United JState6 ? Or are
they afraid that if these corps are organized
agreeably to the existing laws of the United
States, that they will not be so good a de
fence as if organized according to the pre
sent bill ?
Whrn gentlemen speak of the Western
Infurre&ion, and of volunteer corps, why
do they not fay there was only one volunteer
corps not attached to the militia, out of
12,000 men, and he adduced this as a prcof
to (hew, that whatevtr disorders might take
place in the country, the militia would be
lufficient to quell them. They seemed to
to think differently, and that they are not to
be trulled.
Gentlemen opposed to this motion, charge
the supporters of it, with being* afraid to
put arms into the hands of the citizens.â
The charge was unfounded. They are not
afraid of putting arms into the hands of our
citizen?, but they do not wifli to put ihem
in \W: hands of a few chosen person% to the
exclusion of others. The reliance of the
supporters of this motion is in the people at
large ; that of the oppofers of it, in these
few. Mr. G. cvifhed gentlemen to (hew the
difference betwixt these -corps and militia,
and what are tho great advantages in favour
of these, and then the committee may judge
betwixt the merits of each. He could fee
no advantage from the present plan ; all that
he could conceive from it was, that its sup
porters believe there is moVe fafety in arming j
a feledt few, than in depending upon the
whole people.
But the oommittee are told, that these
volunteers, thus organized, are the best cal
culated for fupprefiing perturbators and dif
organizers. But this was a me r e assertion,
and uo argument had been adduced to prove
that they would be better calculated for that
purpose, than the people at large, or more
likely 10 exert themselves in support of the
conlUtution and liberties of the country.
The gentleman from South-Carolina had
said, there were diforganizers and seditious
persons in this country, and that he was de
termined to support the present system of
alarm ; and yet he has not (hewn where these
diforganizers and perturbators exist. Is
there any thing krown Mr. G. asked, to in
duce a belief that there are persons of this
description in any part of the United States?
And when gentlemen, without any proof,
\VOLUME XIII.
infill that it those volunteers flioll confill o?
men of greater property, they v ili, on that
account, be the moll proper to suppress fedi
tio.n, hi* would not hehtate to fay, that the
aflVrtion implied an illiberal and unfounded
insinuation again !l. all the other clafFes of tho
community, and was a calumny on the great
mass of the people ofthe United States.
But the gentleman from S. Carolina, went
on to support the jultice and policy of a simi
lar plan adopted in England, the effect of
which, he supposes has been to suppress in
furrettion, and to save that country from that
general fyltem ot devaltation which has taken
place throughout Europe- But what, Mr.
G. alked, are the etfeits which we lee ariling'
from this fydem ? From that l'ydem of alarm
and from that combination againil France,
which went hand in hand, at the commence
ment of the European war ? The conleqnence
has been that France has not relied l'atisfied
with making regulations in her own govern
ment, but has subjugated some of the fined;
countries in Europe, and subverted their go
vernments, and Ihe now threatens Great 13ri- v
tain herlelf with"a limilar tate. This Mr. G.
said, iue knoiv has been the effect of those
measures ; but the gentleman from S. Caro
lin, in order to reconcile us to a similar plarr
sets up his-fuppofition againll fa6t, and tells
us o what might haw happened, in Ins opinio
on, had not this fyltem of alarm been adopt
ed in England. He knew what h;Â»d happen
ed, in consequence of those fatal fieps : what
might have happened had they not been a
dopted,, was a matter of conjecture. It was
but a poor conlolation to that nation, to be
told now by its mi nil'ier, " matters would have
been worse, liad I not taken f ich and Inch
measures." And if a limilar conduit was
now purlued by this country, and Ihould be
attended with limilar calamities, it would af
ford but a miserable comfort to America, to>
fcearj two years hence, the gentleman from
South Carolina alien that a contrary courfc
would have produced, in his opinion, I'tiU
greater evils. It could not be denied that
that fytftem of alarm which the gentleman
from S. Carolini commended, had in En"-
land, increased that difatfeclion which it was
its objeÂ£t to suppress, and the fame effett
would be produced here by similar measures.
How was the alarm in England supported f
By means limilar to those adopted in this house
this day. A gentleman riles from his feat,
and tells the committee he saw five or fix men
in the flreets ot this city with "French cock
ades in their hats. He fays that some one
had reported, that it was said, that somebody
had heard that one of them had said, lie
would join the French if they landed here,
the gentleman immediately concluded that
there is a deep Conspiracy in the countiy,
and thousands ready to do the fame. The
fame things were done in England at the be
ginning of the war ; the tower was fortified
on account of an infurreflion which no one had
ever heard of. Every member on this floor
might remember the numerous artifices used
there at that time ; and it was in order to a
void the evils which had been produced irt
England by that fyfiem that he wiihed it to
cease here ; that he wiflied, indeed of plac
ing these Young Men in corps separate from
the Militia, to have them joined to it, foasto
make one undivided general defence for the
country, indead of separating them in the way
proposed, which could only produce divisions
and uneasiness amongd the people.
Mr. G. said, he would make no remark up
on what fell from the gentleman from S. Ca
rolina, as to the unfairfiefs of this motion to
ftnke out the lection, indead of endeavouiing
to amend it. He thought it was not less un
fair for gentlemen to wifn a contrary course
to be taken, whild they declare themfsives
unwilling to agree to any amendments which
would make it more agreeable to those who
oppose it. Nor (tiould'he make any remarks
upon what had fallen from that gentleman on
the fubjei*l of Ireland, in refpedt to the Exe
cutive Directory fitting there, or of the day
appointed lor a general massacre. He had
seen such things in the papers. How true or
fa He they were, he could not fay. But he
did know that there had been for a long
time in exillence there a fyltem of Military
Coercion, Which had doubtless increased the
difatfetlion which before eluded, and which
will, in the end prove fatal to the Govern
ment of Ireland. Yet the gentleman from S.
Carolina fays there may be a time when it
will be proper that the fame Military Coer
cion Ihould exilt here. He tr'ufied, that gen
tleman was the only one. who anticipated inch
an event, and he did not think it nerelfary to
refute or comment on that oblervation.
For a number of years, Mr. G. said, at
tempts had been made, in different shapes
to give to the Prelident of the United States
a Standing Army, or felecl corps of Militia
Ever lince the organization of the present
Canditutiun these attempts had been on every
occalion repeated and defeated. This kind
of half-way Army and Militia would ettect
the purpose, and might become the moll dan
gerous of all others; and whatever might be
the fate of this motion, he never would re
pent to have exerted himfelf as far as he was
able in order to prevent its introduction.
Mr. G. concluded, with faying that he was
sorry he had taken up so much o* the time of
the committee on thisqueftion. He had foo
ken three times ; which he would not have
done, had any other gentlemen anj'wered the
observations whigh had been made in oppoli
tion to this motion by the gentleman from S
Carolina. But however di(agreeable it was to
him to be obliged to rife so often," not only to
meet the arguments of some gentlemen, but
the abuse and impertinent allnfions of other*
nothing Ihould prevent hi in from doin . it'
whild he had hopes that the fata! measure no w
proposed might be defeated.
Mr. Allen wished to know how the Go
vernment cduldget a more effectual defence
than by putting the quedioivto every citiz a
of the United States, " IVillyiuin cafeof dan
ger, became a l'ialunteir in the public Service ? >
Government does not chufe, like the'gentle
man from Hennfylvania, to rely upon the
militia altogether ; but to addreis the whole
people, and not a few, m the manner he had
dated, and he milled this quedion would
not be anlwercd by a few, nor by the rich, a.
lÂ°ne,
The people of the five Eadern States, Mr.
A. said, are already armed and equipped, at
their own expence ; and it could not be (aid
they are rich. The people in these dafs ar-*
lo well armed and difcipliiied, that there will
; be no occasion tor them to offer themselves as
volunteers. In other places, but a (mall pro.
portion of the people ars armed", lathi- cji*Mr. A. said, a great proportion of the people
are unarmed ; and he could fee no milchief
ttut could arise fiojm pn r ting arms into their
hands by means of this kind, which was the
only way in which it could be done. And he
believed the organization of these brave and
gerwrous young men, would produce the best
effects.
What the committee had heard from the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, of this being
a plan to arm the rich against the poar, was
said to raise a popular clamour against it, and
it was for this purpole that the gentleman had
risen three times to-day. Whilst the people
from every quarter of the Union are addrefling
the government, with offers ol their lives and
forcunes in support ot our measures against
France, the gentleman from Pennsylvania
wifties to take no measures for our security.
There is something very extraordinary in this.
But the young men of our country, poflefs a
different spirit; they are resolved to unite in
the,r country's cause ; and they will be able
effectually to prevent insurrections and in
ful- *rom taking place in the large cities,
which are most fubjeft to them.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania has
endeavoured to excite jealousy against these
volunteers in another nay, by insinuating an
idea that the reason cf the power of appointing
the officers of the f e corps being placed in the
Prefidentj is, because the present militia of
ficers cannot be trusted. This, Mr. A. said,
was not the truth ; nobody had such an idea.
But are'hefe men ready to offer their service ?
If they are, it is not known. If they do of
er then*fervice, there .s no doubt the Preli
dent will commiflion them. But the gentle- â 
man is not Willing that those who offer their
service fhoulu De relied upon, but that all
should be compelled to enter into the service,
whether they are willing or not. He thought
it was more generods to accept of voluntary
service only, which Mould be made exclu
ly by thofc who join heartily in the cause in
which we are engaged.
Mr. Macon said, the constitution had li
mited the railing out ot the militia to three
cases, viz, to execute the laws, suppress in
lwrrections, and repel invasions, and he could
not fee for what other purposes troops could
be wanted, or why the militia were not equal
to all these purposes. He witoied gentlemen
to speak plainly as to the purposes for which
these men are wanted.
1 he gentleman from S. Carolina said, that
if these corps were not organized, the French
would soon be here, and take the cash from
the Bankers and the produce and other pro
perty from the farmers. But how could these
youths resist any attack*, which the militia,
which would embrace not only them but all
other citizens, would nor be able to refill. As
to the spirit which that gentlemanfpoke of be
ing imparted to the youth by this law, he did
not believe if they wanted a spirit to defend
tiieir country, that this law would give it
them; but he was sure the spirit would not be
wanting, whenever danger appears.
Mr. M. noticed what had fallen from the
gentleman from S. Carolina, with respect to
members afting contrary to the wishes of their
constituents, and 'aid no confidcration should
ever prevent him from doing what appeared
to him to be his duty; and if he was convin
ced his constituents were diffutisfied with his
conduct, he would notwa.t to be turned out,
but would immediately relinquish li s feat.
Mr. M. never wished to fee such a f'yftem
of alarm etfifting in tins country as exjfted in
England and Ireland, lie never wished to
fee lpies andinformers riding about the coun-\
try totake people up on account of their po- ;
litical opinions. He should be glad to fee the
spirit of 1776 here, though he did not wish to
fee the old Congress revived. Ke believed
the old Congrels had done well,, but he be
lieved the present a better system os-govern
ment than thatwas.
The question had not yet been determined,
whether these corps were to be tonfidered in.
the light of militia qr regulars. If the form
er, i> had been shewn these young gentlemen
m : V join volunteer corps already in exift
encs ; and if the laf r cr, there wereal .vays re
cruiting officers wit?i v,*fiom they might enlifl;
but he d.d not believe many of them would
wifii to become common soldiers, though, in
all special cases, they would, he doubted not,
be ready to cotne for/ ard. But this has been
called a formidable force fur the suppression
of seditious insurrections, but he did not be
lieve it could be more so than the militia itfelf.
Mr. M. denied that Congress had the pow
er to create a mongrel kind of army such as
is now proposed. He called upon any gen
tleman to put his finger upon that part of the
constitution which gives Congress this autho
rity.
The provision which confines the use of
these corps to the fiate to which they belong,
and to the states adjoining, he said, would
prove a very unequal regulation, as some of
t hc states only join to two states, others to
sve.
. The gentleman from S. Carolina fays, that
armed allociations are the natural defence of
Republican Governments. He never believ
ed that this government depended upon arm
ed associations for support. It appeared to
him that these armed military alfociations
have more the of Jacobinism than
any thing he had ever heard of 111 that House.
Mr. M after ridiculing the do&rine Of a
larro set up by the gentleman from S. Caroli
na, concluded with faying that he believed if
the French were to land ir\ this country, they
would find very few persons to join them. He
was sure that from the part of the country
from whence he came that would be the safe.
The people in that part of the country would
very deeply regret a war, but if it did take
place of necclfity, they would join heartily in
it. If the constitution does not please them
in all refpetts, they know an armed force is
not the inftriament by which it ought to be
amended ; and he knew whatever a majority
determined upon, would by them be carried
into effett.
Mr. Dana said, he should not have risen
at all on this fubjett, had the gentleman from
Pennsylvania confined himfelf to the merits
of the question; but after rifingas monarch of
the opposition, and apologizing for having
spoken three times, because nobody else
ipoke, he said that the embodying of these
volunteers would beraifmga dangerous ftan
cing army, that it would be arming one part
of the citizens against another; that it would
prove the deftruclion of the militia, and that
the whole of the militia might become a part
of this army. He also fays tiie provision will
be useless, and because, under the militia
law, all the advantages proposed by this bill
might be had. Why then, he would ask, do
not these volunteers now exist? He appre
hended the true reason was, because the field
officers are appointed by the individual states,
and not by the President of the United States.
But it is said, this provision is useless, be
cause of the requisition of the 80,000 militia,
ordered at the last ffcflion. This, he said, had
been frequently mentioned, though nobody
would consider this force as any thingâit is a
mere business on paper. The men detached
do not know tl>eir own officers. Many of the
officers have been prymoted, and a number
of the men removed ; so that he did not sup
pose three-fourths of thole men could be
found, if called upon. They are ev.en worse
than nothing.
It is also said that these volunteers will
form a (landing army dangerous to liberty.
What do gentlemen mean by a fending army?
Do they make use of the term because they
find it in the constitution ? Or because, in
countries where armies are formed of the
word of men, where they are engaged for
life, and where their objedl is plunder and
rapine? ThÂ« term (landing army only ap
plies where officers and men have views dif
tinft from the people, and can by no means
apply to the young men contemplated by this
feÂ£tion. If they were tejoin a banditti in
desolating the country, whose property would
they destroy ? Theii own, or that of their pa
rents or friends. And against whom tvould
they -turn their arms ? Against their parents,
their brethren and friends. And whose habi
tations would they destroy ? Those in which
they had been bred and educated. Can any
one believe then that evils of this kind can be
apprehended from these patriotic young men?
He thought they could not be entertained for
a moment.
In proportion as our military force is ex
tended, Mr. D. said, itlofes the charafterof
an army. An army of 10,000 men may have
something ofa spirit distinCt from the people ;
but if it is extended to 100,000, it will cease
to have that spirit; it will have only the spi
rit of the people. This is one of the causes
afligned by one of the best writers on the sub
ject of the French revolution, which produc
ed that spirit in the French soldiers wkich led
them to join in the revolution against their
monarch ; their numbers were so large that
there was infufed their body the spirit of
the people. But the gentleman from Penn
lylvania fays, the establishment of this corps,
will make an odious diftuiction between rich
and poor, as if that gentleman were the bul
wark of Sansculotifm. Was this intended to
excite a jealousy in the poor towards the rich,
and a spirit of hatred to the government ? If
not, he could not tell why such language was
used.
What are the advantages expefted to rcfult
from this fe&ion ? They are the admiflioq of
a body of patriotic, refpeftable, generous
youth, into the public service ; who will
form a firm phalanx against any internal or ex
ternal enemy. His ideas of this fe&ion were,
that the youth, which it contemplates will re
main liable to militia duty, both officers and
men, until called into the public service ; but
when called into public service, they will be
conlidered as troops of the United States.
The question upon striking out the fe>slion
was then put and negatived 56 to 37.

PHILADELPHIA,
THURSDAY EVENING, Junb 7.
At a meeting of the citizens residing in the
town of Cumberland, in the county of
Allegany ard slate of Maryland, and its
vicinity, held on Friday, the 2 J(h flay of
May, 1798, after due notice; Ilanfon
Biifcoe was appointed Chairman, and
Fatrick Murdoch, John H. Bayard Sa
muel Selby 3d, John Simkins and George
Dent were named a Committee, to draw
up and report an address to the President
of the United States, on the pref-nt criti
cal situation of our country with France.
The fame day the committee reported ail
address as follows :
To JOHN ADAMS,
President of the UnitÂ«d States.
THE inhabitants of thÂ«- county of
Allegany and slate of Maryland, having
early discovered, in an uneqnivocal manner,
their decided approbation of the govern
ment of their country, and the measures of
its adminitlration, and on every public op
portunity since having evinced the fame
principles with unabated zeal and inprjafing
unanimity, we do not imagine that we can
be fufpefted of improper motives if we have - t
notprefled forward on this occasion. While
our fellow-citizens, then, were expressing
that zeal and indignation which animates
every American bosom at the unheard of
insults and injuries which the Republic of
France has heaped on the government and
people whom yow represent, we have fuf
fered those to take the lead, many of whom
were (low to believe and have now but lately
discovered that a cool and insulting con
tempt of the laws which bind nations could
exist underthe sacred but abused names of
Liberty and a Republic.
Now that the croud has in some measure
past, permit US, Sir, to renew our aflurances
of our rooted attachment to the constitution
and government of our country, and of our
relpeft and veneratian for yourfelf second
only to that which ws mull ever feel so*
your truly dignified Predeceflbr in whofc
steps you so worthily tread, of our abhor
rence of all foreign influence upon our coun.

viz
WISHING to cultivate peace and har
mony with a'l nations, we feel great regret
at the delay in the reception of our Envoys
to France, and think their million of such
magnitude as to have entitled them to a
propc attention; and as it appears highly
important at this crisis of our national af
fairs that our fentiraents (hnuld be made
known, we do not hesitate to declare our
firm determination to iupport our conilitu
tion, government and independence against
every attack.
Resolved, That the Chairman be 'equeft

worthy of our applause and confidence,

the and judicious manner in which
they have conduced themselves in the per
formance of their duty.

that yoar future coi dtnS and ability will do j
jnftice to the manly expreffi n of the people !
and to the high tXpedations, which the j
energy of the government, hath induced

France, attempt 10 pluck from the brow of j

intrigue rob us, of what we have purchased
with our blood .' No Sir! Since the supreme
disposer of humau evtnts, to whose provi

1 â  GENTLEMEN,
J THE existing crisis in the affairs of the
Union, djmands the serious attention of ev
Â«ry friend to the independence, honor, and
fafety, of our country. â¢
1 T-obliterate the fenfeof gratitude, which
was cherished for services rendered by France,
] during our conflift with Great-Britain ; to
extinguilh the entl ufiafm, which was inlpi
' red by her firft revolutionary movements, in
favuur of Liberty ; and to convert the phy- 1
fical and political sources of reciprocal at
tachment between the two Republics, into '
sentiments of hoftility;âare effe&s that can
only find an adequate cause, in the system '
ofvioleÂ»ce and depredation, of injustice add I
contumely, by 'which the Government of i 1
that nation has, recently, d fgraced its own '
character, and violated our rights.
It is no longer, however, ufeful to reason ; 1
nor honorable to repine: It has been, au- '
thoritatively, announced, that our govern- (
mentjis compelled to relinquish every hope of !
Peace, and to prepare for the painful alter
native of war. The Constitution of the '
United States has devolved upon the de- c
| partments of the Federal Government, the â 
j power and the duty to provide forthecom
i mon defence; but the power and the duty c
iof co-operation, so as to facilitate and ef- C
j fefluate their meafiires, are, likewise, con- C
ftitutionally attached to the jurifdi&ion t.f ,
the individual States ; and form, indeed, an
essential part of the charafter and capacity, Â°
of every citizen of ttti Union. Upon this r
impulse, and with this view, then, I have - V
circulated the present Address : And, lam J
confident, Gentlemen, tlfat while the na- j
tional authority is anxiously engaged, in
making general for executing
its arduous trust, the Militia of Pennsylva
nia, will not omit any point cf preparation,
which can evince the promptitude of their Â°
spirit, and the ardor of their patriotism. ''
In addition, therefore, to the provisions
which have been made by Congress, it re
mains, for the purposes of national defenee,
to pursue efficient measures for enrolling, '
organizing and equipping the great body â¢
of the Militia ; but, lam so fenfibleof the !"
defefls of the existing 1 w, that I should
defpairof success, if (independent of every
legifiative provision) my experience did not
juftify me in reposing a perfeil confidence,
upon the voluntary exertions of every offi
cer, and of every freeman, at a period so in- t h
to the public welfare. Permit me,
therefore, Gentlemen, to call upon you, in T)
the mod earned manner, to unite, with
alacrity and zeal, in the service of your
country ; and, let it always be remembered, rn:
that to protest her from insult, outrage and
dishonor, is to ensure your own happiness, llr
and to elevate your own charafter. P r
The objefts peculiarly deserving your im
mediate attention, may be included in the 1
following fummrfy propositions.
lft.LetthequotaotPennfylvania, underthe m;
Aft of Congress direfling a draft of eighty I XJ
thousand men to bu made from the militia 1 vo
of the United States, be put into fiich or- | ca
der, as will ensure a punftual and general bv
attendance, at a moment's whrnlpg. Eve- j e ,
ry man, who can supply himftlf with arms ' on
and accoutrements, should do so, upon a I
principle of public spirit, as well as of pofi- | m;
tive duty. The legal days of mufler and i t hi
excrcife should be regularly obfei vtd ; and tin
;very citizen should employ his lei fit re time wl
by improving himfelf in military discipline. a d
2d. Let the enrollments in every Brigade
ne immediately compleated, aiul all vacan- by
:ies of Commissioned Officers be supplied. Sti
It would be highly expedient to form a com- tel
>etent number of a volunteer corps of Caval- ter
y, Infantry, and Artillery, to he attach-, d
o the refpeflive Regiments and Battalions â  rec
ipon the principles of thefecond Seiilion of of
he Militia Aft. nie
3d. Let the number of citizens enrolled,
nd the (late of the arms and equipments in by
ach Brigade, be accurately reported as soon to
s possible. Ihe Legislature has author:* â¢ dai
d a coniid rable purchase of arms for pub- to
lie lift ; and no time (hall be loft inprocu
ring'thcm.
I am aware, gentlemen, that much trau
= ble and expence will urife in the execution
of these in'triwfUons ; but, lam persuad
ed that your personal labors will be compen
sated by the public benefit which they will
7* produce ; and I prgmife, at the next fef:
fion of the legislature, ts"enforce the claims
for a r-iinburfement of every reasonable
, co- P ec ""iary charge, with the Itrongeft re
eitor commendation, that the juilice and necelfity
Ad- of the cafe will admit,
la-ch * cannot conclude this address, without
JIC reminding every class of my fellow citizens
inry the importance of its objefts. To the
iei!i Veterans, who were active in our revolu
tion tionary war, it will not be indifferent, when
reflect, t'fat the fame patriotic v rtues
which ellablifhed our Nation al Indepjn
that ' dÂ£ nce, will always be competent to pro-
Sov-I test our national rights. The rising
ri&- ; generation from the present crisis, an
J ou early opportunity ro prove, that they are
worthy of that glorious inheritance, a Free
> Rt publican GpvEitNiv!, nt, which has
fj, been prepared for them by the courage and
wifdem of their ancestors. And every en
. lightened ftattfman will surely rejoice,when
ft c he beholds in thi militia of thi- v
n i on, a competent bulwark for its defence
and Ufety ; âfuperfeding the ncceffity, and
you averting the darget t f a numerous Handing

HAVING observed an advertisement of C.

feffional abilities, we have to request the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to
decide upon the merits of each by a comparison ot
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta

ing the public, and engrofling that business which
their profeffional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opinion must
govern, we flatter ourselves that the work execut
