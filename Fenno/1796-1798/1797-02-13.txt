AN ENQUIRY Ja
Concerning Political Justice, I<
And its Influence on Morals and HappiÂ«efs, w
By William Godwin.
THE ceputation of this work is already well efta
b!rfhÂ«H*-Puroprâlt is hardly aiecefliry for. an Ame- '
rican editor to fay more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning PcJitieal Justice has ever
iince its publication been a favorite performance with
the friends of republican government. The stile is
pure, nervous, and elaflical; the ideas are strongly Vj
marked by aw original vein of thinking ; and, amongst
a multitude of other just and striking paflages, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities iefepa- C
rable from , the condition of a King, may be pointed
' Â®ut as a'molt masterly specimen of philosophical dif
xjuifition. The late# London edition of this work ar
fells in this city at four dollars and an half. re

ny objections which had been made to his plan.,â
That wauld be more pioper at another time, if any
should be made which he might think it neceflsry
to attend to.
He had Hated a variety Â«f objtf&s which wenld
produce large films more t+ian was now called for.
He had also shewn that the duty had.greatly increa
sed : and that notwithstanding the additional duty
which bad in the interim been increase of
duty proved the augmentation of the coHfvimpttoii
to have been veiy coniiderable.
ivlr. H. then went into a particular (latement of
the dutits arWing from ea'eh article upon which he
proposed an advance, shewing what they had pro
duced in the years 1793, 1794 and 1795, with the
drawbacks and net produce, with other pariicu.
lars ; but as these have been already stated, though
not so particularly as have been drawn our, yet
fuftciently so "we presume for the ibfarmatien of
our readers, we (hall not again go into the detail.
Mr. Harper said the objeftlons wliich had been
urged againfl indire& taxes, preved too much j
they proved that they should be takeoff ihoge
ther from. commerce, and laid wholly or land ; for
it the ptopifed tax were to be laid on land, there
would still rcwain five millions dependent on com
merce, which would not be less liable to deltrudtion.
The'duties which he prOposed to lay, nar. H. said,
rould be vefy ealily hereafter transferred. A system
of dircift taxation might bt ,â¢ hut in the na
ture of experiment ; and as it was uncertain, a great
part of the revenue should not reft upon it; but if at
any time commerce v/m operated upon, a part of the*
duty might be transferred. They had been tÂ«ld, he
said, that our revenue might be in dafcger from the
Trench or Â£nglifh ; but, he would ask if we had not
been pillaged by the English, by the French and by the
Algerines ? Yet, under all these circumitanees the reve
-Bne had increased. He believed a direct war could nÂ»t
have a worse effed> ; for then, probably, their proper
ty would only be destroyed by one power. Why then,
he said, were they told of the uncertainty of our reve
nue 'besides, they were in the fitaation, and how could
they be got out-of it ?
It did not require the learning and ingenuity of the
gentleman from I}eifiifylvania to tell them the merchant
did not pay the revenue. The peqple were the payeri.
The merchant got an advantage by the tax, on /gcouut
of which he enhanced the price Â»f his goods. Com
jnerce received new vigour and spirit from this tan
He hoped, therefore, they'fhould not resort to a tax so
inconvenient and impraflicable as a laad tax, until they
tad examined the fubjeft a little more, because he saw
fource# from which the money might be drawn in a s
manner more equally.
As to the neceflity of additional revenu", no state
ments were -to prove that. The gentleman
from Maflachufetts had shewn how they might dedu&
about aoo,eoo dollars; but what was this if it could
be saved ? The necessity was admitted da: all hands, ex
cept by that gentleman.
Jft. H. said, if the plan which he had ih view, should
not have the efTeft, he would join hand arrd heart with
-those who wished tjiretfl taxes. He wished to fee them
large i he wished to pay the deht because it was a con
tinual fubjeil of anathema, lie would go to two mil
lions of dollars, if neeell'ary, and what share of it might
go towards the public debt ; not that he thought it bore
heavy upon them, but because a fubjedl of discontent,
cavil and invective.
Mr. Gallatin said, the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. Varnum) had stated to* them that there-was no
necessity for laying a revenue equal to what had bsen
contemplated. The gentleman fiom S. Carolina, just
fat down, on the contrary had told them there was the
peceffity to,the greatest extent. Yet, he said, if thev
were to draw any deductions from his calculations,
they would be that there was no want of further re-ve
nue ; as the document upon which he had grounded
his arguments was aftatement exhibiting the rmounts
of drawbacks paid upon the dutiable articles exported
from the United States in 1793, '794 and 1795, in
which was slated in one column the amount of duties
received, and in the next, the amount of the drawbacks
paid: for instance, take the addition of 1795, viz. the
amount received in 1794, and i; will be found 8,5X8,382
dollars : if this w ere really so, tnfteadof being about
fix millions, as estimated by the Secretary of the Trea
sury, it was clear they needed not to go into a calcu
lation about raifir.g fi'efh revenue.
The faifl was, Mr. G. laid, he believed the gentle-
S. Carolina (Mr. Harper) had not fuiTici
ei.t'.y attended to the ftatetne it in qneftion. Ti.e a
mou ut of duties there stated, though duties receiveubic,
verc duties accredited, .and not dutieJ actually receiv
ed, upon goods imported.
We know alio, said Mr. G. that the amount of re
â venne as stated by the gentleman from N. Jcifey ( Mr.
Hcnflerfon.) was eight- millions ; but liable to great
drawbacks, bo h on Wcft-india snd English ijocds.
Mr. G. said he did not mean to follow the genrttrnan
from S. Carolina (ivlr- Harper) into any of the details
v-hieh he had stated refpe6iing the revenue ariftng from
imports ; frfr though he believed him altogether mif
tiken in them, yet the principle was the fame. The
Â»i"ftiou was, "âtether the revenue wanted should be'
railed by advancing the duty on imports, or by a airedl
tax.
It was necessary, however, before he proceeded any
further, to notice what had fallen from the gentleman
from Maflachufetts (Mr. Varnum) as far as related to
the aflual revenue and expenditure. He agreed with
that gentleman that the revenue was Ttated too low,
and the-expenditure tco lifgh, by the secretary of liie
tieafury, oh two articles, viz. ujion goods inipcited,
and the military establishment. 1b his report 011 the
fulye&of diieft taxation, he had .calculated ' be receipts
of the revenue to the 31ft December 1795. The
ground upÂ«n which the gentleman from Matla.hufetts
went was to calculate the revenue for 1796 ; and it was
ti tie, that the receipts for that year had confidcrably ex
ceeded the former ; but the only question was, which
was the best gr. und for a permanent calculation ! It
waÂ»difficult to determine ; but, be believed, in gene
fal, there was no reason to believe the highest cal
culation u oul.l bethe real revenue v.ben a peace took
place in Europe.
The gentleman from S. Carolina, had even suppo
sed a war could noti affeÂ£l our imports ; lie would leave
him in the happy idea ; but Mr. G. fakl,' he wai not
afraid of war, he hiiped inoft ardently for a state of
pca> wh tb he drubred not would ta'te p'aet, and
when it did lake place, the confequcnte would be a re
duclien of our revenue. The ilUpttitiou of
the documents he had mentioned would shew that the
high price of our exports, ;he quantity of European
importations, and thf great amount of Weft lu lis pro
ductions, were the causes of the high receipts at the
Cuftom-hÂ»ufe. And the moment a pence took place,
there would be a failure iti the exports, we should be
deprived of the W'eft-lndi.l carrying trade, it our
exports were less, our imports rnuft also he left. In con
lequence of the wealth brought inttftlu . country by
the European war, we had been enatled to confumc
an extraordinary quantity of these pisduflinns ; but
the moment a peace tor k place, a certain defalcation
in our revenue will be the confequeice. To what a
mount this might be, no or.e coildte'd.
On this ground, Mr. G. said, it was morejrudent to
take tht ioweft than tlie highÂ«ft calculatior ; and he
thought the secretary of the treasury hail 00,e lu> duty
as a public officer by so aiding. He was right in taking
1795 itftead of 1796 ; becaule taking the amount as a
permanent revenue, it vnas the beft'ground. It was
true, there was another item which the secretary had
ftateci, -which he did not take lor granted. He had put
down >be military and naval eltablifhfljent t*,j milli
ons. He thought that fiini might hi reduced doo,ooo
dÂ«liarÂ« ; for his own (hare, he hud no efejeftion to make
it much lower still, when making a calt'uhtion of that
kind, it must be made upon the then eftablifhmtnt,
which was 1,590,000 dollars. He thought, therefore,
that the secretary of the treasury might have cakua
tcd about 5a0,eÂ«0 dollars less, which would
ced tliefum wantedinaddi:ioaalreveÂ«Be from 1,428,75S
dollars to 728,796 dollars.
Mr. G. said he would go farther and fay, that calsu
late the revenue as they pleased, it wouM be equal "to
our present turrent expeafes, and it would be so until
the year jKoo; but in--i3oi, additional revenue ruuj
be had. It was not for curreni expetifet, but to pay
the principal of a debt loaned in Holland, and antici
pations which had been obtained from the banks. Ex
perience had told them ther* yas now no raqre loans
to be got. It was therefore?hecefiary to provide for
the inftalnÂ»ents of the foreign debt whiih woald then
fait due, for which no provjlioiv was made.
, If it were proper to eucreafe the revenue at the pre
sent time, 80c,000 dollars were lufficicnt ; still, if an
encreafe was neccifary,, it waÂ» right to have an eye to
what would Eereafteiijie waited This brought them'
back to the qtveftion, how (hall the money be raised,
by indireil or direcS taxts ?
It would be well to obfe. vy that gentlemen opposed
to tanation, ia recommending a system of-indi
r?di taxes, had confufrd their plans by diredt tijtcs al
so. The- flamp duty, lit allowed, was an indirect tÂ»x ;
but a window tax was certainly not fe. He would
confine, however, his observations to indiretSl as con
trafted with taxes.
If he lud information before him, that there would
be no danger of embarrassing trade, or encrei6ng
fmugghng, by daing so, he (hould'have no oh t eAion
to a moderate encreafe Â«f the duty on goods imported.
He believed the impost duty the best adapted to this
country ; but he must confel's he had not that informa
tion which woidd enable him to draw this concluficn.
The gentleman from South-Carolina hid, howevtr,
not oi)I y determined upon the propriet/ of theadditidi,
but also the sum it would raise. He himfelf had 10
documents for eoming to these rooclufions., /
The molt powerful objeAieu which hadbeenurged
again ft dirciil taxes, was the difficulty of collecting
the money' He believed this difficulty exifled kt pre
sent also in sea-ports. This difficulty of collecting
money in the country waÂ« not applicable to a direst
tax only, but to all nthere; but, he laid, in the pre
ie*t fitnation of our cities, he believed there was not
t more difficulty ia colleiSmg money in the country than
laxities.
As to the manner in which such a tax would fall, it
would, l'ke others, fall opou the people. Hl did
not mean to tilfa notice of what had been Taid about
the mede of afliflment ; that was a tnstter of
at present not before them. This, -he said, he knew,
from the experience of tf.is state, that t/ie difficulties
attending such a fyTtem woukl he infinitely less tlban
had been stated by the gentleman from South Camliiia
âThe expense of collecfling a tax thui drawn from
the people was fiinply tliat of aJTeffing and colleaing;
but to an indirect tax, were to be added tl ( e profits
which the merchant never failed to lay upon the tax,
and this profit operated as an additional tax upon- tht
people.
In Ptwnfylvania, he said, where yeariy afieflments
were made (and not once in three years as was said
by the secretary of the treasury in his renort) the ex
pence was not more than per cent. If, upon full
examination of the fubiect, it was found impossible
to raifc the imports, and if they rejected a tax upon
land, he did not fee to what object they could apply,
except to a tax on fait. This, he allowed, would be
easily I 'llectcd, and easily refoi ted to. Neirjy three
millions of buiaels wcie imported annually, jstsÂ«oo
of which, he fuppoferi, were err.ployed in fairing pro
vifiuns. Lay what duty thev woiajci upon this article
it mud be paid. There could be no dohbt as to the
produciivertfs of such a tax; but was there not some
as to the propriety of it ? And when they were told a
taxÂ«n land would fall upon farmers, he would alk
upon whom a lax on fait would fall ? It was confut
ed by men or by cattle. Whin it was cdhfumed by
men, it would fall upon them in proportion to tbeir
numbers. If there was any difference, it would fall
heavier on the poorer class ; particularly i.pon the far
mer, as much the largcft quantity was coniume l by
them- So iar as fait was qonfumed by men,, the tax
would operate as a poll tax, ffccordiug to numbers,
and not to wraith. But was a tax that would fall
upon cattle to be encouraged in |!iis country > Indeed
th?re was not much difference between thfrfalt's being
conmmed hy the farmer or by his stock, afid the gen
tleman from South-Carolina was nor left mistaken *-
bout the quantity of fait given to cattle, than about
forte other ;bings. What would be the effect? It
would either raise t*e prise Of catfle, or the quantity
of fait now used would be diminished. If a reduiftion
in quantity waÂ» to be the confequci* e, HO effea could
be more perniciuus; and if it were not to have that ef
fect, but to encreafe the price of cattle, would there
be much justice or policy in adopting any measure
which (honld have the effect to advance the price of
butcher's meat, or to decrease tht export of cattle,
which was the only export from this country, which
was at present upon the encreale- an eaport which had
within thelaft lix years been doubled.

Mil. BOWS N, ]
I AM a countryman, and having read the Que
ties in your Gazette of ihe 13th inffant, 1 palled
them over for that time ; hut going lately on foma |
domrUic business to a mill in my neighborhood, I (
heard a conversation there between two ot my (
neighbors, Air. fruitier and Mr IVorrcn, which,
for the fake of>the gentleman who proposed said j
queries, 1 (hall herÂ«* fubjoiu. Yel fiift it may be
neeeffary ta inform him, that Mr Truliber is a plain .
honest (armer, who lludies little else than the ad- (
vam ement of that laudable profeffion, but who,
neverjielefs, is a hearty friend to his and |
wifhesthat every tljjpg we haVe to export may bear
a good price ; and that Mr. Warren has taken some
pains to acquire a knowledge in the political affairs
of his < 9untry.
Mr. Tâ Dull Timesâdull times, Mr. Warren, (
yvheat falling every day ; it will foÂ«n become a
mere drug ; what can be the meaning of this, Mr.
Warren ? . ,
Mr. IV.âThe reason is, Mr. Truliber, because
the French will not fuffdT us to carry any thing ,10
or from British ports, which cuts,off near*/ two- .
thirds of onr trade. Sâ
Mr. T. Aye, Aye*, I was reading Something
about that in a late newfyaper; how, if the Briifh (
take our (hips, (hould not the French, to be even
with hem, do so too ! Now, I suppose, there must i
be fomethingas hard as the D~vil iB that question,, (
or it would not have been put in the nenfpapers to
get an answer to. (
W. Why I will Rate a cafe to yon that â  (
will make the matter a little plainer. Her* yoi
give part of your custom to Mr, Anderfoii'l mill,
and part to Mr. Brown's. I
Mr. T.~ Yes, 1 fend my wheat to Mr. Ander
fon's,' and u.y corn to Mr. Brown's, for common
Mr. /r. -7-Well, now, suppose some quarrel
â * should arise between Mr. A. and Mr. B. and Mr. ,
A. to be revenged on Mr. B. should take it into his
head to intercept and feiee all your corn on the '
rotid to Mr. B's mill ; and if Mr. B. to injure Mr.
A. (hrttfld feiaeiill your wheat on the road to Mr.
A's millâwould he be juftifiable with regard to
yon I ' x
Mr. T.âNo, egad, the one ought to be hanged
aa well as t'other.
Mr. W. N'>w, Mt. Truliber, the French have
no more right to feixe our veflels, in the manner
they do, than Mt. B. would have to seize jour
'wheat in the cafe just mentioned, even if the Bri
tifti were guilty of the fame violation every day,
which, for any intelligence vvÂ« have received, has
rot been the cafe finee the ratification wf the
tieaty.
Mr T-âP(ha, if that's all, egad, I ceuld
have anfweted that qtteftien myfelf; and, for that ,
n>a;ttr, so might my wife, and put it in the news
papers too. But when 1 have been at the court, 1
and liftei.cd 'o some of our politictaneis there talk
ing aboutâthe law o,f nations 1 think it was, and 1
about the Bntilh and French both taking a pluck 1
at un, becÃVii'e we hadn't a fleet, I did not know i
but the law of nations might befomething like the
dog law. where every one worries the weakest, or
the one th*t'Â« down.
1 Mr. fV. The law ef nations, Mr. Truliber, con
fids of certain general rules, commonly observed by
all nations, with regard to one another ; and that
particular one which is atoll involved Â«n the pref
ect occafien, is to this purportâwhen two nations
are at war, the property, of the third, Â»r neutral
nation, is always restored, when taken by either
â¢f them on board a fliip 6f the other ; and, on she
contrary, 'he property of either of the contending
nations, when found on board of neutral Alips, is
always cot>fidered as lawful prize by the other; ;
moreover, Mr. Tiuliber, in the-treaty between the
United States and Franee, it was mutually agreed,
to relinqutfh tpis rule, and eftablifli another in its
place, viz, that the property of enemies, found on
board the ships of either Franee or America, should
be free and' undftiurbed by the other ; and, on the
contrary, that the property of either nation, found
on board enemy's (hips, should be confiderÂ«d as law
ful ptizÂ«.âBut the former rule in, the law of n.i*
tiorn remains as.it is in ht treaty ketwetn this coun
try and Great Britain: And in answer to the gen
tleman's query, where be demands, why France
1 ought not to be put npon a footing with mod at
favoured nation, let it be temeAibered, that if th? pi
Britifti derive any advantage from the observance n<
of that rule, byfeizing French property on board pi
American ships, that this advantage was not beflow
ed upon them as a favor by America, jut that they â¢ gs
were pofTeffcui of it long before. How then can pi
America be said to favor any nation, when (lie ci
grants thera nothing which (he had ittbeltow ? But ar
the French have not only broken their treaty with us, w
but they have gone further, and violated the law of
nations, by seizing our ships with our own property at
on beard. . m
Mr. T.âAnd what could induce them to take is
such a tanterum as that Mr Warren ? *Â«
Mr. IV.âNothing in the world, only because we
preferred an amicable adjuflment ot our dispute B
with Great Britain to the dccilioo of tho sword.
Mr. T.âAnd so, because we didn't fight,
they'll whip us, eh ?
Mr. W.âYes, or because we did not make a bet
ter treaty with Great Britain.
Mr. T. â Why ei-rajl, now, that's ju(l as if I was o
to go and beat John Stoue there, for not making a a
better bargain t'other day, when he fold his bay y
horseâthough hÂ« did as well as he eould, I fnppofe. si
, Mr. W.âJuft so, Mi. Truliber ; and as to a I,
change of tone in feme of our great ntÂ»n, which 11
is the fubjeft of one of the gentlemen's queries, 1 tÂ«
imagine, when the medium is drawn, be: *sea the il

(Here Mr Truliber fleppcd forward, and took up b;
the paper, which was laying on the head of a flour ai
barrel, to try what remarks he could make, and, bi
, read â¢'that generous"âbut not being able to I
make out the word " magnanimous," be passed it q 1
over and said, " that generous nation"âyes, egad, tc
very generous ; fueh generoufnefs as that puts me ft
in mind of ihe ttoty about the cat and the monkey,

when the monkey wnnted to pull some chefnuts a
out of the fire, he made use of the cat's paws for a
tongs, and pok'd them into the co;.ls! now, ac- 7
I cording to accounts, that's the way the French are h
serving us, Mr. Warren)
Mr. W [ think it is a very near resemblance ;
indeed, M. Truliber ; for though the Fiench were
called our friends, yet, whenever they could gain a Â«
| small advantage, by doing us a great injury, they ri
have not scrupled to make use of us is tbe monkey I

We had yesterday the latisfacflion of anaouncing
generally, that the fubfcriptinn for the new loan had
been finally closed. Thi we ftatNl to have taken place
at half palt eleven, whereas it was at tweuty minutes
past ten âtwenty minutes only, after the books had
been opened. At ten o'clock in the morning, the par
lor doors of the bank were opened, before which time
the lobby was crowded. It was a pleafmg fight to fee
feme of the firfl merchants of the city of
running. w,ith cagernel's to the bar, whieh was so pref
fcd upon by the crowd, as to require being propped up.
Numbers could not get near the books at all; while
others, to teftify their zeal, called to the persons at the
hooks then figning,-to put down their names for tnem,
as they were frarful of being shut out. At about 20
minutes past ten, the fnbfcription was declared to ke
completely full, ai.d hundreds in the room were reluct
antly obliged to go away.
By the poll yesterday, innumerable orders came frotii
the country for fubferiptions to be put down, scarcely
one of which could be execute!. For some hours af
ter the fubfeription was closed, persons continued som
ing, arfH were obliged to depart disappointed.
Stocks yesterday experienced a rife of one per
cent. They were down for the opening as high a*
59-84. This rife may be partly attributed to the
spirit of loyalty and patriotism which has been so
unequivocally exprefled on the occasion of the loan,
and to the circumflance of the ExecutivofDire&ory
c<f France having assented te the proportion of the
Biitiffi court, that the principle of the compenfatioa

f The intelligence from the army nf Italy is very im
-1 portaiit. The current of vidlory, it is with concern
we remark, continues its rapid course in a favorable di
rection to I,he French caofe. After\he defeat of the
Imperial Field Marshal Buonapare proceeded
to attack the army of gerteral Jjavidovich, whieh had
' forced the French lines that covered the bloclcade of
Mantua, and advanced as far as Caftelnavo , On the
, 21ft ult. he came up with this division, which hefovi
- goroufly attacked, that in a short time the Auftrians
j retreated with precipitation in every (lireition, and were
clefely pursued the whole of the night by the enemy
j above the Corona, and along the Atlige. The rear
guard of the Imperialists fuffered very severely. Ele
ven hundred prisoners, among whom was Col- Count
de Lherbach, four pieces of cannon, and fix caffons,
1 fell into the hifnds of the French. This victory is the
e more entitled to serious attention, as it serves te confirm

(- Franklin, AUw LondonPorcupine's Gazette.
Propofali by WILLIAM COB3ETT, opposite Christ
Church, Philadelphia, for publishing 1 , newÂ»-paper, (
to be entitled
Porcupine's Gazette, Â£5Â° Daily Advertiser.
Methinks 1 hear the reader exclaim ; " What! haÂ»e
wt not Gazettes enough already ?" Yes, and far tao
many: but those that "we have, are, in general, con
dueled in ftich a manner that their great number, m
ftead of rendering mine unneeeflary, it the only cause
that cdle for its eUab!Hhment.
The gazettes in this country have done it more real in- Â£
,jufy tli.w ell itsopeu enemies ever did orear.do. They p
miiicud the people at home and iiiifreprefent them a- q
broad. It was these vehicles of (edition and discord f (
that encouraged the counties in the Well to rebel ; it t,
was they that gave riie to the depredations of Britain,
by exciting the people to fu;U a<Sj oi- violence against y
that nation, as left no room to doVn that vÂ«e were,de- 4
termintd on war ; an>l it was they, when an accorn- n
modation had been happily effeiÂ£led,_that stirred up an t
opposition to it luck as has seldom bicn witnefied, and a
which was overcome by mere chance. These gazettes
it was, "that, jy misrepresenting the dispositions of the
people, encouraged the French to proieed from one
degree of ijifsience to pother, 'till at last their Minis- _
terj braves the i'refideht in his chair, and a bullying
commander comes and tells us that his only bulinefs is<
to seize our vefiels, in violation of a treaty, in virtue E
â¢t which ajone he claims aright to cater our ports: and ''
it Is these gazettes thJt now have the impudence to pe- '
fend what their falfehood and malice have produced
I lhall be told that the people are to blame; that
they are not obliged to read these abominable publiea- '
tions. But they do redd them; and thonfands who
*eÂ»d them, read nothing else. To suppress them is im- v
pofliljle ; they will vomit forth their poison ; itisapri- j
vilege of their natures, that no law can abridge ; and
therefore the only mode left is, to countermft its effects.
This must be done, too, in theirown way. Books, 5
or periodic2l publications jn the form of books, may
be of force service, but are by no means a match for -
their flying folios. A falfehood that remains uncontra
dicted for a month, begins to hi looked upon as a truth,
and when the detection at last makes its appearance, it
is often as useless as that of the dodtor who finds his
patient expired. The only method of opposition, then,
is to meet them on their own ground ; to set foot to a
foot ; difpnte every inch and every hair's breadth ; '
jiglit them at thoir own weapons, and return them two
blows for one-
A gazette of this (lamp is what I have long wished to
Tee, but I have wished and axpecled it in vain. Indig
nation at the fupinenefs of others has at last got the
better of ajl diffidence in my own capacity, andhasdc- 1
termined me to encounter the talk. People Have heard ,
one fide long enough ; they now hear the other.

â c- of his head and back of his neck, and in all directions. Â£
it- Nearly -the lame took place upon a woman ; and
et, a-ll that I saw treated, profeffed that their pains t
:o- after being treated a fliort time : and several came volun-
