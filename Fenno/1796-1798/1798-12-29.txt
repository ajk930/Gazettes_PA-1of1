AMERICAN SOCIETY
UNITED IRISHMEN.
â  n Adopting the following
CON STI TU TI 0 A'.
. [the declared intention, of procuring
" equality and liberty to ALL men," is a efear
woof Ireland alone was jiot in their view.
But, a# tre go on, we shall perceive that nei
ther that country nor its concerns are at all
included in the objects of thefc people. The
woid Imlund,.lrishmen, kc. are mere l'ub
fhtutes for athnr words, like the cant of the
pick-pockets, according to which a hog means
A shilling, a pig ment a sixpence, and io on.
This wil clearly appear from the articles and
TES T of the precious -constitution.]
Sec. t. That ALL SUCH PERSONS
and fuel only, ftiail be eligible to this Socie
ty of United Irishmen, as Shall have fuffered
in the Â«?ufe ox or who, bv therf
zeal for THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND,
ihall ha'e rendered themselves dillinguiftied
and wortliy of attachment and truil.
[Thus, you fee, it is not IRISHMEN
alone, wio are eligible to this Society ; but
ALL SUCH PERSONS as shall, according
to theii 'ant, have suffered in the cause of
freedom, or have (hewn their zeal for the
rights of mankind ! ! In other words, Â«\e
ry. fcsundrel, of whatever nation, provided
his bctn manaded or transported, or has
rendered himfelf worthv of the gibbet, for
some attempt at rebellion or fomc of trea
son, ne- natter under what goverrmxnt or on
what occasion ; or, provided his seditious
principles are so well known and eftabjifhed
as to leave no room to doubt ef his attach
ment tc the cause. Americans then, and
Britons and Frenchmen, and men of every
countrybeing eligible to the foc.ety, can any
oÂ«e be fily enough to suppose, that the con
lpiracy had Ireland m view ? What-had anv
ot these people to do with Ireland ? But
on the Jbfurdity of thi. w (haU have time
to reTna'kby-e-and-bye. Indeed, the TEST
Ail L S,VCS this can-t about Ireland.
A that is neceffiiy to remark on this fec
tlon>\'sÂ» that it provides for the admission of
evjry discontented, factious man in the Unit
ed States : and that the latter partÂ«f it is no
snore than a copy of tjpe qualification clause
the J*cobin CkÂ»bÂ«t.-P*rij, except that the
Utter requÂ«d pofitiye proof from every new
member of his having actually committed son*

Sec. 7. I. Do you believe a free form of

11. Do you think the people of Ireland
are In polL (lion of tlieferights.

the utmost of his power for the attainment of
LIBERTY and EQUALITY, to MAN
KIND ; and, thefc efforts does he swear to
make, IN WHAT EVER NATION HE
MA"i RESIDE I Ireland, therefore, if not
totally difmified by the TEST, is no more
contemplated by it than America is, taking
the words in their literal sense ; and we (lull
I<* in the fc-quel, that this blessed liberty
and equality is intended for America alone.
The criminality pf.the purpose and end of
the combination mod amply proved by
the lection that immediately follows the
TESI.â" Ihe TEST of this fopicty and
the INTENTION of the inftitutioo fliall
be kept a SECRET and INVIOLABLE."
âThe members may tell the world that it is
a " social body, attached to freedom that

are friendly to general liberty; they may
represent it as. one of those .collections of in
dividuals that men of sense ufuallv laugh at,
but they must not fay a word about the IN

they discover the nature of the OATH.
.''. nol Hiug more "were meant than
an aflbciation against. the government of

would excite contempt and ridicule, v/hv

the oath ; and, particularly, why Conceal
the intention of the inditution I
By the 9th Seftjon we fee, that the dis
coveries, made even to thbfe who offer'them
felves as members, are to extend no f.irt'.ier

are to know nothing of, "till they have gone
too far to retreat, and then diev Ire bound
not to divulge what they have learnt. First,
the initiated member swears, that he " will
never, from fear ef punishment or bo be of
tewardy divylge any of the secrets, given to
him as such ? aixl then the INTENTION
ol the inftitiifion is immediately given to him
as one of the those inviolable secrets ! If

[Now, leaving the mere formalities and
other trifling thi<sgs aside, let us plan and
look at it in its sub ft ance. It is very pro
perly called, an '* enlarged organization," for
it embraces an extent no less than that of
the whole union.
First, we fee, that every restless wretch,
of whatever nation, is admitted ">n any sec
tion of the society, and has his name, place
of residence, 3cc. exre'lled on its lift ; but,
left the affen blages should bee >m? unwiel
dy, or ala ming to the magiftratts, these
feAiotis when they get to a certain strength
feptrate, and the d.tached parts form new
ones, just ai bees swarm when the hive is
over-crowded âThe troops being thus en
rolled in the fettions, the next thing is to
render them manageable. Were thef-Â£ions
fubjefled to no Superior command; were
tbey to remain scattered over the country
â without any common head, they would be
like so many independent companies without
a commander. But these troops have not
bern raised to He in idleness, and tierefore,
a mode of uniting their efforts is provided.
Fhe fe&ions in every state are to fend dele
gates to form a State Committee, aid th: fe
4xtees State Committees are to fend dele
gate! t/Â» Vnrm a Gtneral Ex*currrs Com- o
rntfUt;" &iiJ ihis is the whole broufrli* -to b
â¢, O "
one point. , t!
So much for the organization. Now for e
the operate part of the p] n. tl
" The general ExECUTItF. Committee" ti
(which I have tot the leatt doubt is now
litt ng in Philadelphia) keep* up a constant o
communication with the iitate Committees, c
and from it, the whole fÂ«Â« iety, or rather b
army, receives ' dire&ious" when and how II
to aÂ£V. It has (teams made to it of the
fitimberi enrblled in eachStatc,ofthe na-nes,
reudeiice, and occupation, of the pcrfons en
rolled j by ti.is mean it is at all times infor
med of it* flrength, and of whete that I
ftrfctigth lits; j
When it is necefTary TO ACT, the G"- t
nfcral Executive Committee are to tlifpatch i
their orderd tQ.the State Committee; these to I
their fe&ions, aid these again (by their t
Committee of secrecy) to their sub feÃhttr. a
Here the orders resell the ufiivc trtops, and c
that their may be no confufion in their *
movements, these sub fcSions consist of only )
eight men each,all living near one another, Â£
and one of these eight is a fort of non com- i
mission officer, who, (to use the very words t
of the confpiratars) is to " hÂ«ve the charge <
of the other seven, and is to WARN them I
IN CASES OFURGENCY"!! ! s
Now, 1 appeal 'o any man of common
Tense, whether tin's infernal combinatiou czn
possibly have any other objed in view than '
an infurreftion agaitift the government cf
America. What " cafei of urgency" can a
rise in thit country, what oppoutunity can
offer itfelf here, for overturning the Brtijh â  ,
Government tn Ireland ? Where thevi:lai< s, | '
Mndeen furnifned with wing/ ; could thev like
other birds of passage, afTemble in a flock
and take their flight to Ireland ; then the
oftenlible motive of the afTociation would
have fomethiag like plausibility about it ;
but, as they are, this ostensible motive is a
palpable absurdity, a mere trick which has
been invented *n order to inveiglt ignorant
persons to take the TEST* and, in cafe of
desertion, to avoid the punishment which
the law awards to traitors and fpia\ or at
\tffr , to leave room for doubt and conten
tion in the courts of justice; a bad chance
b. ing better than none and ten years impri
sonment being better than death.
That this conspiracy it intended to aid
the cause of Frame, it is hardly necefiary to
infill on ; every one must perceive it at the
firft glance. What can these ragged ruf
fian* expett to do alone 7 How can they alone
support their current expencrs, exclusive of
" cases of urgency "oi arms, ammunition, &c.
&c. By an attention to the financical part
of their plan, you will perceive, that the
money they colleft from the members is
barely fufficient to' defray the charges jvhich
must neccfiarily be incurred for rooms to
meet in. Who is to pay for printing their
CONSTITUTIONS, their CERTIFI
CATES (which I hear is from an engraved
copper plate) ; who is to pay for the time
and travelling expences of all their delegates
from the Sedtions of the State Committees,
and from them to the General Executive
Committee at Philadelphia ; who is to pay
-q tij imt scsiÂ» itiatl forty
fand dollar* annually ? Who hlit those "who
boalt of tbtir *â¢ Diplomatick Skill," atid of
their " powerfulfaÃion in ihis country ; those
who have long had in pay the leading patriots
in Ireland, and who have constantly fup.or
ted a hireling press in each of the principal
cities of America ?
Next, observe thr.t the dofeft intimacy
exist* between the fans-culotte French who
are h re, the molt distinguished of the emi
grated United Irilhmen, and a base Ameri
can printer, notorimtfly in the service of
France. Observe too, 'hat NAPPER
TANDY went from New-York to France,
amfthat the conspiracy, as appears by its
date, was not formed, 'till after ivc heard *f
his arrival at Paris.
The leaders in this conspiracy are the ve
ry fame rerfons, who conduced that in Ire'- 1
land. When a feftion of their deluded parti
zans, in that country, were taken unawares
by the no money but French
was found upon them, and this in a retired
patt of the kingdom, where it was impoffi
blc these infatuated wretches could have
come at it through any other channel than
that of the defp.its of Paris and their wicked
agents. And, if a conspiracy could be so
effc&ually paid there, in a country at open
war Â« i h France, with an alien law vigorou
sly enforced, how easy mud it be for them
to maintain a hired and regularly paid con
spiracy here, when there is no check what
soever to their machinations !
This diabolical plan was formed on the
Bth of August lad; immediately before the
Yellow Fever commenced its rage in
this city ; with ihi* in tiis recolb&ion the
reader will form hi* opinion refpefting the
following, which is a copy of the printed
paper before mentioned,
AMERICAN SOCIETY,
UNITED IRISHMEN.
When the society of United Irishmen
was formed her; mm where found emulau*
, of crouding to the V'fh standard, for the
afpeft Â«f Ireland then afforded hope that her
wrongs would Soon be redressed.âThat
view so consoling to humanity, has fir a
â¢ moment been obfeured ; but it is not ho
nourable to desert a deserving friend in di
stress, it is not honourable to abandon a me
ritorious cause, which, when prosperous we
i have fworti to support.
The society is happy to find, that there
is Hill reason to think, the fire and the
! lc<)urge will not long be exercised aver our
â  brethren with impunity, that the tyranni
â  cal imprifonmen:*, the rapes, the arsons,
the torturers, atid the military murders are
t .ibuutto be aÂ«erg<d, and, that a manly peo
l pie, whom 600 years flavtry could not de

t;r than the 9th of Oftober. The Packet "
failed for this port 9 days before captain

The Deputation Of the Empire, in the
68th fitting, pafied a ccmchnum, which dc- 1
clares, th *t they will not make any further 1
conceflions to France. The French minis- 1
ters have privately communicate} to the '
members of the cosgreft, that their govern
ment does not require any further potTeffioii
on the right bank of the Rhine, and that
they desire with the mod fmCere solicitude
the immediate establishment of peace.
Genoa, Sept, 3.
It appears that all CorCcans in the Eng
lifi) service, or such of them as are attached
to thecaufe of Britain, are to unite in the
iJland of Elba. The reason of this is not
known, but it is supposed that an expedition
will be made against the eastern Corsica or
the illand of Rosa, where they kept up a se
cret understanding with the party of Paoh.
The Genoele marine is to have two more
frigate, two corvettes, and two xebeet.

" The number of prisoners taken by the

Admiral Nelfoh found it unadvifeable to

them, put them on the coast of Egypt, firft
making them take oir oath not to ferye a

London, Ccf. 9.
Amongst the papers intercepted by admi
ral Nelson is a letter from gen. Buonaparte,
to his brother Joseph Buonaparte, member
of the council of five hundred, and form, r!v
ambafladorat Rome. It contains interesting
details refpefting his expedition, hi! Ktuatiori,
: and the confluences of the ckftruft.On of
: the French .fleet. He complains bitterly of
the French government, which deceived-fiim
in regard to the difpotitton of the inhabitants
: of Egypt, and the means of Pucceeding in
his enterprize. He re pre lints his Jltuaticn
as extremely critical, from the-dimitiution of
his army, by difeafes,by the battles he is con
tinually obliged to fh-ht, by the detachments
required topreferve the chain of communi
cation between Cairo, Rofetta, and Alexan
' dria, by the garril'ons of these towns, atrd
' adds these wordsâ" My poiition is luch
: that I can neither advance nor'retreat."
r Thii letter contains a variety of reflections
