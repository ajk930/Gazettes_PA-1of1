DEBATE ON THE BILL FROM THE SENATE, AU
l's THORISIMG THE PRESIDENT TO RAISE A
at PROVISIONAL ARMY.
TC
| n TUESDAY MAY I.
(Concluded ftom Scturday't Gazette.J
Mr. Brent said, he was not in the house
iâ when the arguments of ihe gentleman from
of j Pennsylvania were delivered, and was there
d j fore only acquainted with them from the
E * comments which had been made upon them
by the two gentlemen lad up, which he con
ceived by no means overturned them.
Two queftjons naturally present themselves
tb the mind on this occaliqn the one as it
refpefls the constitutionality of the bill, and
the other as to its expediency. And it had
struck him, from the firft moment the sub
jest came before .he house, that the power
!s proposed to be placed in the hands of the
; President by this bill, was perfetHy uncon
tlitutional ; nor had hte heard any thing in
the difcuflion which could induce him to
phange his opinion. A variety of precedents
have been introduced to (hew that limilar
powers have bten given in former inllances.
But tho e precedents had no influence upon
him. If the aftÃ referred to Were unconsti
tutional, they still remain to be so. Error
will continue to be error however frequently
it is repeated.
Without examining whether the precedent!
which had been adduced were in point, he
would leave them, and examine the question
on its own merits as a constitutional question.
The C'onftitution fays, Congress shall have
. power to raise and support arnnes. The pow
er is as explicit, as defined as" it Could be.â
But what is the purpose ot this bill ! It is to
give to the President of the United States the
' uncontrolled.right, for fix years, to determine
whether or not an army (hall be raised. Con
gress, then, in whom alone the Constitution
has placed the power of raising armies, will
be deprived, during that time, of that power.
And it" Congress have the power ef diverting
. themselves of this right, and transferring it
for fix years, they may do it for ten years, or
tor a term equal to the existence of the Con
stitution. But he did not believe they had
the power of making this transfer.
The words in the Conftituiion, giving the
power to Congress of declaring war, are the
lame with those giving them the power of
raising an army ; yet if a prapolition was
made to transfer to the Preiidenr the right
of declaring war in certain contingencies, the
measure would at once appear so outrageous,
that it would meet with immediate oppositi
on j but the transfer of one power would not
; be more unconstitutional than the other; both
were velted with them, and wiljiout a most
fhameful direliction of duty; _thÂ«y. could not
aiveil themselves of them.
But the gentleman from Maflfachufetts has
'supposed that this objection is removed, by
the exercise of the power being made to de
pend on certain contingencies. The thing a
mounts to the fame, the President is to raise
the army, whenever, in his opinion, immi
nent danger of an invasion exists; therefore,
the railing of it will depend upon his will, as
he alone is to determine when this danger ex
ists. And the question returns, Has Congress
a right to deprive themselves of this powef,
â  in order to give it to the President? To his
mind, there could be no proposition more e
vident than that they must themselves exer-
I cife the power.
But the gentleman from Maffachufftts has
i said, that the words of the clatifein the Con-
I ftitution which forbids individual States from
engaging in war, are as follow : " except in
cafe ot invasion, or imminent danger which
will admit of no delay." This, Mr. B. said,
was a very different thing from the present
bill. This power was a fort of felf-defence,
which was to be used in cafesof neceflity, and
of which we cannot divert ourselves, in cases
where theaflillanceof the United States could
not be obtained. This power could not be
abused, as no particular interell could arise ]
from the employment ofit. There lyas, there- i
fore, no analogy between the two cases.
In short, from every view which he had
been able to give the fubjeft, he was deci- ,
(iedly of opinion, that Congress ought imme
diately to proceed to the raising of an army, j
or defer it altogetheruntiltheir next meeting. \
Mr, B. said, he had bitherto confined him- i
felf to the unconftitutisnality of the measure; i
but as others may differ from him in opinion ,
in this respect, he would consider the expedi- ]
ency of it; and he would freely declare tor :
himfelf, that if the President might be legal- i
ly empowered to raise this army in the way ]
proposed, there is no circumstance in our pre- j
sent situation which would induce him to t
raise one man. He had himfelf no apprehen
sion of an invasion, and until he saw some- j
thing more threatening than at present, he â¢
should never consent to the increase of our i
present military etiablifhment. .
Gentlemen may declaim as much as they i
will about the incapacity of the United States i
to repel invasion. He believed himfelf that J
the militia of the country are equal to its de- |
fence; he believed with the gentleman from i
N. Carolina {Mr. R. Williams) "thatJla-vcs f
fight for money, and freemen ftr liberty." He t
did not mean, he said, by this, to cast any re- i
flection upon hired soldiers; but he believed, >
that freemen, poireffed of every thing valua- 1
ble in society that liberty and good govern- i
ment>could give, would always be ready to \
repel any invasion which may be attempted <
against them, a;id until Congress can be got t
together, he believed our militia would be i
perfedly competent to our defence; for, \
notwithstanding what had been (aid with re- t
fpeÂ£t to the incompetency of our militia, he ,1
would (ay that their services in out revoluti- r
on proved the contrary. He would travel r
with gentlemen from the East to the South,
and he was certain that the conduit of these t
degraded militia, during the war, might be t
compared with that of the regular arnay, c
without any dishonour to them. 1
Mr. B. (aid it was a very memorable cir- p
cumftance, that in the arguments on thisfub- e
ject .heretofore, and in private conversation, r
this provilional army was always (aid to be i
wanted for the Southern parts of the Union.
The Eastern States, it was observed, confi- \
dered themselves as perfectly fafe ; but from i
their fraternal affection and abundant care for r
their Qfter States, the gentlemen from those
States wished to provide for the fecnrity of
. the Southern States. For it is a faÂ£t, that
the desire for this.army originates with gen
. flemen from the Eastward, who confefs tlaey
do not want it for themselves, and the repre
sentatives ot the Southern States, generally
speaking, are opposed to an eflablithment of
this kind. [Mr. Dana did not recolleÂ£t that
any gentleman had said the Eastern States
e were facure from invasion.] Mr. B. said he
knew that one of the most cogent reasons ur
ged in favour of this army was, that the Sou
thern States flood in need of them in order
- to qnell any infurreftion which might take
i place amongfl the Blacks in those quarters.
. [Mr. Sew a Li. said he had made ule of an
ex predion which he believed had been uiif
underftood. He spoke of the militia of the*
Southern States as not being in so good order
t as those of the' Eastern States, and that it
1 would be better, therefore, for the PreHdent
\ to have power to raise an army for the defence
or those States, than that the militia should
be marched from the Eastward for the pur
pose.] With refpett to the diforganjzed
state of the militia to the Southward, Mr. B.
â¢ believed he could speak to that point as well
i as the gentleman from MaflaChufetts, and he
> could iay, with truth, that the militia of the
i State which he represented was better organ
. ized now, than it was during the war, and it
will be remembered that the greater part of
the defeiice of that State was then performed
1 by the militia. There were also at that time
a greater proportion of Blacks than there are
at this time, and the enemy with whom we
had then to combat, Offered as great induce
ments to alienate them as Vittor Hughes, or
any other person can do. Those States, how
, ever, not only kept the Blacks in fubordinati
( on, but repulfsd the invading enemy. He
was willing to pledge his own responsibility in
faying, that if the Southern States are fuller
ed to remain as they are, they will be equal to
their own defence. With refped to the dis
organized date of the Southern militia, let
I him ask the gentleman from Maflachufetts,
and those who had reiterated the remarks,
whether it was juftified in their conduit in
marching to suppress the infurreftion which
took place a few years ago in the western part
of this State ? It certainly was not, for when
they were called out to carry intoeffect a law
which was extremely obnoxious to them (he
said extremely obnoxious, because none ever
was more so than the Excise law to the peo
ple ofVirginia) yet, notwithstanding the dis
organized state of the militia of Virginia, not
withstanding they were cailed upon at a very
(hort notice, they were ready sooner than the
most sanguine expected them. And they were
not then called Â«pon to meet a foreign enemy,
but their fellow citizensâmen with whom
they had fought fide by fide for their liberty
and independence ; yet, notwithstanding their
disorganized state, they were capable of dif
cerwingthe necelTity of crushing an oppofitioh
to the execution of the laws.
As to a French invasion, and that it is ne
ceflary to have an army to prevent it, it is i
dle and vain to talk of it; it is a mere bugbear.
Gentlemen who speak of this have surely for
gotten the immense ocean which happily se
parates us from Europe, as well as the im
mense militia of the country. Let us, said
he, go on and make the people salutary laws;
let the people experience the bleflings of a
good government; convince them that every
civil institution is intended to promote their
happiness, and you will not require a standing
army either to defend the country against in
ternal or external enemies.
The gentleman from Maflfachufetts appre
hends that France may invade us before we
expert it. Because Ihe has a large army on 1
her coast, he supposes (lie may immediately J
transport them to our coast, and overwhelm |
us with them. But when he recolletts the j
distance there is betwixt them and us, hemuft ;
be convinced that the French have no means j
of trartfporting a large army hefe, except they j
emprio.yballoons for thepurpofe. He believ- j
ed the danger did not exili, nor did he believe
there wusahy difpoiition in France to invade ,
us. Even if /he poffefTes all that spirit of do
mination of which gentlemen speak, flie need j
not pass a tempestuous ocean to exercise it, as
there are mitcfh more convenient situations ;
than this country, for her puYpofe, nearer <
home. If ihe be not retrained by moral con- i
fiderations, therefore, those of convenience <
will be fufficiently operative.
Mr. Brent concluded by faying, that there -
could scarCely be any situation in which he <
should be induced to vote for raising a fiand- 1
ingariny, as he ronfidered (landing armies as j
the banc and deftrudtion ot free countries, and |
nothing but a situation of things which would i
make it elTentially neceflCary, could prevail up- j
on him to go into the measure. Not being a- i
larmed to the extent which some gentlemen i
appear to be, he was willing to let things re- <
main as they are; for he was no more appre- <
henfrve of an invasion, than he was apprehen- !
live of being transported before night into
the moon. \
Mr. Otis observed that this bill wasob- 1
jested to on the ground of its unconftitution- j
ality, as if it were intended by it to delegate j
the power which belongs to Congress to raise (
an army to the Pre/ident of the United States; r
whereas no such thing is intendedâthis army 1
will not be raised by the President, but by this >
House. The bill was proposed, Indeed, to be j
patted in a form which would make the rai- c
ling of the army depend upon certain contin- \
gencies, to be judged of by the President \
but he believed ail the three contingencies i
perfectly definite in their nature. And he
wished to kÂ«ow what difference there would f
be betwixt giving the President the power of r
raising this army, in cafe of a declaration of i
war, afi invasion, or ot there being imminent j
danger of invasion, awd his calling Congress \
together for the parpofe, in any of those e- r
vents ? And he would alk also whether, if it c
was the opinion of the Pre/ident that the coun - c
try waS in imminent danger of beinginvaded, f
any gentleman would wish to take so much [
responsibility uppn himfelf as to oppose the e
railing of an army. t
Wherever absolute ,power was inverted, 1
there could be no doubt but that power might f
be executed upon a condition. If Congress 1
could raise an ai.my to-morrow, they certain- t
ly might order it to be raised in the manner a
proposed, aS no member could afcerrain the t
extent of danger 'or himfelf, he mull in some c
measure depend upon the Pre/ident for his
information. f
The gentleman toft up fays the precedents \
which had been adduced produce'! no effect c
upon his mind, as error must fjr.ver remain r
error; but believed that wlje > once a ore- {
' cedent was ellablilhed, the cgnfequeoce ol
t cfoing it away ought to be conlidercd before
t it is reverted. It the acts in which this prin
ciple is recognized, be declared iinconftitd'ti
' onal, wha< becomes of yom present military
- e(t.iblilhntt'nt, of your gallies, Sec ? The
whole laws and eftabjifhmentsmuft be diftbl
t ved. The present military force would be
t unconftitutional.allthemeneyborrowedonloan
s would be unconftitutional,and every thing done
: underthefefeverallaws wouldbe null and void.
1 f this course was to be taken, some new
â¢ mode of doing bufitiefs mult be invented.
9uppo(e, if infeead ofaathorizing the Pre*
' fident to raise an army in cafe certain contin
. gencies. take place, Congress were immedi-
I ately to order the army to be railed, might
â  they not fay that the President (hould luve
> power (as they had heretofore "done) of for
r bearing to raise them, if, in his opinion, cir
cumltances (hallhave so changed, as to m.tke
t the army unneceflary? They certainly might,
: anil the two powers amounted to the fame
1 thing.
Mr. O. fa:d he (hould not follow gentlemen
t through all the remarks which they had made
relative to the expediency of the present mea
sure; but he would notice such as he thought
: had any weight.âlt wasfaidnoinvafionef this
: country could be expefled, because it was
ther in the power, nor was it the interest of
France to invade this country. But there may
bemenin powerin Francewhohavean interel't
in it; and he (hould think it natural for them-to
: conceive they had the power, if we declined
: to raise any force against them. Besides.'is
they think they can detach one part of our
country from another, and that they have
here a strong party in their favour, they may
invade the country, not with a view of.con
quering it, but merely for the purpose of
displacing the present Adminillration, aod of
fixing another in its Head, more to their taste.
He did not himfelf think the French had the
power of invading the country, nor did he
think they would find it to be their inlercft,
but perhaps they might not forefee this; and
ought not a fufficient number, fregulariroops
to be rAised to give aid to the militia, and to
impart to them discipline and courage?â
Could there be any fear that the Prelident
would raise these men, if no danger threaten
ed the country? He did not believe that
this could be apprehended.
But it wasfaid, that if the country was inva
ded, the Militia of the country would be com
petent to its defence. He was furpriled to
hear the polition advanced. He believed the
Militia of this country was as good as that oÂ£
any other ; but would any man fay that Mili
tia were able to Hand against veteran soldiers ?
Was nothing due to discipline and experience ?
It we were invaded, would it be by militia
men ? No ; it would be by men who would
laugh at the idea of being opposed by militia.
Militia might fight very well for a short time ;
but they could not be expeited to be fuccefs
tul against regular troops. It was vain and idle,
therefore, to talk of defence, except gentle
men would concur in railing an army. It an
invasion was attempted, it would be of great
consequence that we (hould have experienced
officers ready 10 take the field immediately.
The gentleman last up had descanted on the
invidious comparisons which had been made
betwixt the Militia of the Eastern and Sou
thern States. Every opinion which he had ot
the Southern militia, he had gathered from
gentlemen from that quarter of the country.
He had been informed that out of 7,000 mi
litia in N. Carolina only 500 had arms, and
when the Militiabill was under confidei'ation,
he understood that the Militia of that country
wasin a very indifferent state. And as hecon
(idered himfelf as much interested in the de
fence of theSouthernas the Eastern States, all
being a part of jtlie common country whose
interests he had to consider, he had as much,
right to consider what was necessary for tTie
' defence of those states as any other, l iulhould
' be sorry to have that part of the Union over
| run, and if it could be prevented by 10 or
; 15,000"troops, he should wilh to raise them for
the purpose. Not that the danger ofinvafion
was confined to the southern country. It wa3
quite as lilcelv to take place to the eastward.
The port of Newport was as likely to he at
tacked as any other in the Union ; because if
an i' nemy got poflellion of that port, hey
could go out and in when they liked, and ex
tend their depredations to the southward or
eastward at pleasure. But the gentleman from
Virginia fays, the militia of that State id
wonders in the War. He did not wifii to depre
ciate the militia, he were one of them himfelf;
but though the Militia was very serviceable
in the war, yet he did not thjnk they were
the principal defence of the southern country}
they foriietimes fought well, but they also
sometimes runaway.âlndeed, he believed the
idea was in every p, Â»' of the world given up,
that a Militia is equal to the complete defence
of any country. And was nothing due to tile
opinion of other countries in this refpertf
Shall we, said he, (land still and fay to our
Euemy, " we know you cannot aiid will not
invade hs ?" If we are not invaded, it will be
because there will be 110 profpetfl of success ;
and except means of defence were taken, this
prospeCt may not appear clear; for, however
confident we may be in our Militia, we fliall
not be able to mike the veteran troops of
Enrope believe that they can defend us. It
was therefore worth a hundred times the e*-
pence of raising thele troops, to change the
opinion which may be entertained of our
weakness in that partofthe world, and to con
vince them that we mean to be prepared to
meet any attack which may be made upon us.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania had
said, an invasion could not be expelled du
ring the present season. He had himfelf no
idea of an invasion whilst the waF continued in
Europe ; but it an end was put to that, it
would he more likely that an attack (hould be
made upon us during this season than at any
other. When the aimy of England, as it is
called, and the drips prepar ; ng to convey if,
fliall be no longer wanted for what was said to
be their present obje6t, nothing would be more
easy than to fend these (oldjers and velfejs ei
ther against this country, or to Ijouifiana, and
he fliould consider one step pretty much the
fame as the other. After all that had been
heard of the f'.cret articles in the treaty be
twixt Franceand Spain, such an event was not
at all improbable ; and if such an event were
to take place, he believed more than either 10
or 15,000 men would be wanted.
He owned he had rather provision had been
for 50,000 than 10,000 men, as ho expence
would be called for, except there was a ne
celfity far raising the men, and if there was'
that neceflity, he fliould wilh the lorce to be
fuffirie-ut foi the purpose for which it waÂ»
[Volume XIII.tailed. The only question at present was,
w nether, from a conftittiuonal doubt which
had no foundation, the house would reftt r e to
give the President the power propofeyl, and
by that means delay the raifingof men,"until
the President should call Congress together,
which would be at least two months after the
danger appeared. In his opinion, this was no
time for aking these nice constitutional scru
ples, he thought the power ought to be given,
or the army immediately raised. Indeed no
army could be raised without giving to the
Prelident a certain degree of power. For his
part, he thought as much discretion was given
to the President when an army was ordered to
be raised immediately, as in the mode propo
sed by this bill. And the power to raise an
army, when a certain contingency (hall take
place, was by no means equal to thÂ£ power
placed in the President, of commanding the
army when it is raised. Mr. O. hoped therefore
the fedion would be retained.
Mr. M'Dowell was much better pleated
With the amendment proposed by the feledt
committee, thin with the bill as it originally
tame from the Senate ; but he had objections
to the amendment on conftitutianal ground.
He believed the power of determining the fit
time to rase an army was verted in Congress,
and could not be transferred. Hed'dnotwiih
to put it in the power of the President, or of
any other man, or body of men, to appoint a
large numberot officers, and create a very hea
vy ex pence without neceflity. Especially
when he saw, from the communications which
Were bef re the house, that there was reason
to believe, that if this power was given, the
President would immediately appoint officers,
and proceed to raise the men. If the situation
of the country requires an army to be raised, he \
wiihed gentlemen to fay so, and propose a re
folutioii to that efleth For his own part, he
did not believe the present situation of the â 
Country required it; but that the Militia was
equal to the defence of the country, at least in
the firft in (la nee. If we were invaded by a for
midable foe, an eftabliftimentof the kind pro
pQfed, and to a much greater extent, might be (
r.ecefTary. But the gentleman last up fays our
Militia are wanting in discipline and arms,
and indifferently officered, and therefore an
army is jiecetfary. He could not fee himfelf
how a change of name could make any differ
ence in the competency of force. It was nei
ther bounty, nor a coat that could make afol
dier. I fan invasion takes place, the Militia
mud be relied upon at the firfi. As to what
the gentleman had said about the Militia be
ing badly disciplined and officered, it might in
lb me refpefts be true ; but so far as it related
to the Militia of N. Carolina, he would tell
that gentleman that whoever were his infor
mants, that the aflcrtion was not correft.
The Militia of tfiat State had, in most instan
ces, been able to repel any force which had ,
fcome igainft them, with the afliftancc of but ,
very few regulars. But suppose the gentleman
had his 10,000 men, when they werediftribu â¢
ied to different parts of the Union, it would
afford but a small number to each, and the
Militia mud at least principally be depended
upon. Except gentlemen wished, therefore*
to saddle the country with a standing army, he
thought they ought not to vote, for this bill,
as they mud fee how difficult it is to get rid of
any force which has once been raised. Let
them also recollect how much the appoints
naent of a great number of officers in the army
wouldincreafe the influence of the Executive,
andconfequentlv the dangerous effeft it would
have upon the liberty and independence of the
country. The experice was a very confidera
bleobjeft, but that which he had. last named
Was, in his opinion (till greater.
Gentlemen had spoken of the conversati
ons which h-d taken place betwixt X, Y &
Z, and our env< ys in Paris, which thev Teem
ed to think threatened great dangers to this
country. He owned he relied but little up
on that inofficial information, which he
co uld not coafider as coming from the
French nation. If the opinions of indivi
duals in any country were to be taken and
atled upon as the opinions of the nation of
which they have foÂ«med a part, we should
be continually in error ; this might be judga
ed of from what we fee at home, for if the
opinions of some individuals in this country,
or the opinions which are ilTued from some
of thepÂ»efTes here, were to be taken as the
op-mons of the country, and afted upon by
ike French govtrnment, we should think k*
a very extraordinary procedure. Fcr his
part he did nor rely upon these communi
cations, and he was persuaded this country
would be fccure from an invasion from
Fiance, from its not being in her power to
Undertake it, and if it were, that it would
not be her interest to attempt it.
One word. Mr. M'D. said, with refpeA
to the milit a, and he had done. The gen
tleman last up said it was impoflible that 1
they could contend with old veteian troops, j
That gentleman, he believed, had himfelf 1
never had any experience in fighting, and he 1
depended too much ujxon names. He him- '
was acquainted with instances in which 1
our militia had over-turned the greatelt ve- I
terans ; and if this was rot fufficient, if the i
gentleman would reiolleft that some of the <
moll brilliant achievements of the French '<
armies, were acoomplifhed by new, undifci :
plined troops, he would no longer infill up_ t
on his opinion that we mull have a standing <
army to meet an invasion.
Mr. Hap. per could not persuade himfelf t
that the arguments adduced againfl the un- t
Conditutioualitv of the present bill, were ca- *
pable cf a serious reply ; but with refpeft to a
the expediency of the measure, he thought a
there-were some considerations worthy of a
notice, which had not yet been laid before c
the committee.
Gentlemen opposed to this measure, are r
conllantly cOÃtrading the services of the mi
litia with those of regular troops. Nobody *
haÂ« said that the defence of the country i
ought to depend upon regular troops entire- e
ly, or upon the militia entirely," yet gentle- r
men argue as if the queliion was whether the e
country should be, defended by the one or
the other. They gave the force proposed 1
to be raised. indeed, a name which does not
belong to it, viz. that of a standing army, t
Was ab.dy of troops raised only for three h
years, to be called a standing army ? A re- t
gular force and a Handing army are quite n
different things. A standing army is wholly h
in the power of the Executive of a country, n
and not liable to be put down ; fueh an efta., t
blilhment would be alarming in this country, 6
and it had been effeftually preventen fcy the b
confticution, whieh declares that no appro- ji
pria ion for an army shall be made for isore v
t an two-years. ti
Mr, H. said, he was flroÃg'y impressed h
s - with the ufrfulnefs of militia he bclii ved
h they were the great (trrnjrth of this country ; j
j but he did not believe tin y coul 'be called
il into f rvice with fufficient promptm-fa, with
r, out the aid of regular troop., and gentlemen
le who fprak of their experience cannot con
-10 trovert this point. I hey fay the militia
might be called out to meet any predatory
i( j attack; hut < xperieoce did not confirm this. '
le It was well knowa that in sparse fettled
is countries the militia could not tie promptly
n called into fervire ; in compaft settlements,
0 he knew the contrary was trtie. In that
part of the country where this defence was
: mod wanted, the settlement is very thin,and
, r the m litia not being used to aft 'ogeiher,
e would, at firft, make but an indifferent de
'e fence. In the late war the militia were
almost conftanly intermixed with regular
J* troops, and he would not flop to fay how
often they were defeated notwithfla'fcding.
)S It was also well known how long it took
I. to organize these troops, and" how much
it the enemy gained on account of these de
li lays; yrt we are to fay, because our militia
Â£ are brave, and rhe people are attached to
a their liberty, no other troops (hall be em
_ ploye-J in the defence of them but the mii
y tia. He knew that the people were attach
!i ed to their right', and would defend them ; !
n but he also knew, that fomethiig more than
e a disposition to do it was necefTary ; they t
mull have flcill, and what ts more important,
c they mud have commanders. He himfelf
. belonged to one of the bed corps of militia
e in South Carolina, which, though cc mpofed
e of persons who had the greafcd (lake in the 1
s country, wanted discipline, and was far from
1 being prompt in obedience to orders. In
deed, he believed the milicia only wanted i
e the habits of fold ers to make them equal to j
r' regular troops. But gentlemen fay, that [
, there is no danger of ari invasion from Eu
rope, as France had neither troops nor (hips
for the purpose, being wholly engaged in her
' projeft againfl England. But are there no
. Frenchmen but in Europe ? Did gentlemen
i look at the situation of the southern dates?
t It was true the gentleman from Virginia
- (Mr. Brent) had taken upon him to fav that
J he would b â  refponfi'le for the fafety of the
! southern dates, from the militia alone ; but,
. though that gentleman might be well ac
. quainted with the sea coafl of Virginia, he
- believed he knew little of that be ween
1 1 Charleftonand Savannah. It was disagree
' ; able to him to point out the weak places of
the union, nor would he have done it, had
j not gentlemen spoken of the fafety of that
e coast. Mr. H. then mentioned several p'a
1 ces whe e attacks might be made with faci
> lity and success. We know, said he, that
= Victor Hughes and ToufTaint have each of
J- them corifiderable force, and though not fuf
t fici-nt perhaps to expel the troops from St.
. Domingo, th y might be fufficient to fend
1 againlt our southern coall, and do confidera
, ble damage before any opposition eould be
J made to them ; except we had a few thou
' sand regular tronps dationed in that qflar
[ ter; and if they were to get pofTeffion of
Savannah or Charleflon, they might do im
mense milchief before they could be diflodg
-1 ed. He believed it would be wife 10 pre
. vent this mi/chief, and that would be most
effeftuslly done by giving the President the
. power proposed.
â¢ Bcfidet, some regard was due to the feel- 1
! ings of the people in that part of the coun- 1
try; they are alarmed on account of their 1
| situation, and wish Cbngfcfs to. take fotne ;
: measures for their defence. If they find i
the President is veiled with tTie power of raif, i
ing an army, they will be fatisfied ; but if I
they find themselves abandoned, however at- I
tached they may be to the government, this 1
attachment may be dedroyed by neghd. 1
The gentleman from Pennsylvania may rrd
fecurelv on the banks of the Monongahala, J
, and the gentleman from Virginia in the thick <
settlements of that country, but they ought t
to recolleÂ£l also the situation of these expo- I
fed people, and provide for their fafety. r
The Committee had been told by the gen- r
tleman from Pennsylvania that there was no g
danger to be apprehended in the Southern d
States, as the white population was equal to f
the defence of that country ; but if he was t
well acquainted with the fea-coad of that 11
counlry, he would know that the black po- 1
pulation on the fea-coad is very great, and o
that there is a large traft of country foil of a
fa'lntfTes and mardies bttween them and the ll
white population, and that if once the blacks d
made a lodgement in these marsh s, it would it
be difficult to drivÂ« them off. The people h
in this quarter expeft, therefore, in any t<
emergency, to receive aid from government; if
and unless they fee a measure of this kind r;
agreed to, they will be dilheartened and their ft
confidence in the Union will be much weak- r:
ened. w
Mr. H. concluded wi'h hoping the mo, w
tiou to strike out the fedion would be nega- tl
tived, as the force would not be called out tl
without necessity, the President having te te
answer for liis conduft on his responsibility ; w
and if there should be imminent danger of in
an invasion, no one would fay that this force ly
ought to be called out. 0 )
A. motion was mads for the committee to ft:
rife. al
Mr. N. Smith hoped the commkte# to
would not rife. This fubjeft had already bt
undergone one day's, discussion and he doubt- B
ed not by this time every gentleman had (I
made up his mind on the fubjeft. He with- in;
ed, therefore, the question might be taken, eo
Ihe quedion was then put on the com- ne
mittee's rising, and negatived 48 to 35. fta
Mr, R. WILLIAMS then rose, and said if ne
the committee were determined not to rife, fta
he supposed they would be vVilling'to attend co
to what was said on the fubjeft. He could nr
not have sonceived that this question could up
have turned so much upon the disposition of co
members as to the propriety of defending co
t!'.e country. To discover which was the m<
be(t way of defending the country, whether ws
by a regular army or by a militia, was a sub- me
jest well worthy enquiry. In that point of to
view, he fho\ild consider the question ; and H
therefore hoped that nothing which he should fro
fay, would be afenbed to a wifii to oppose l'g
fed any measure for the defence of the country,
y; j The gentleman from South Carolina had
led endeavoured to ma ; e a diftiiiftion betwixt
th- the army prqpÂ»fed to be raised by this bill
len and a danding army ; bin immediately after,
an- his arguments (hewed that he confi iered it
tia in the fame light as a (landing army, as he
>ry said nothing (hr.rt of t!iii could effeitualy
lis. i oppose ai> invasion of the country. For
led part, he cou'd not fee how the calling these
tly men a provifionai army could make them so
its, , much more ejfeaive than in the form of mi
lat ' litia. But the gentleman fay-, it is necef
Â»as j fary for militia to have regular troops to lean
nd upon. He be ieved they were not the kind
er, of defence which the people would wish to
le- lean upon in cafe of an invasion. On the
:re contrary, in such a cafe, he believed cvVry
lai- man would wilt to defend himfelf and family.
3w Mr. W. said, who are the persons intend
ed to compote this provifionai army ? Are
ok they men who have more natural ties to the
ch country than those who compose the miiitia ?
le- No; they are taken from the drcets of large
tia cities ; many cf them are men without any
to attachment ts the country at all, and per
a- haps poffefied of but little principle. He
i- 1 mud. therefore, give the preferer.ee to mi
h- litia.
a; | Gentlemen fay this army is to be raised at
an. the discretion of the President, asd that it
ey J will not be foimed unUfs the circumstances
it, of the country require it; yet, at the fame
elf ume, they go on to point oat parts of the
tia country which at this moment dand in need
ed i defence. It therefore appeared to him,
he that â¢gentlemen were of opinion that if this
â m law pasTed, the President would immediate
n- jly raise the men. The gentleman from S.
Ed ; Carolina fays, he has received letters from
to | his condicuents speaking of their alarm. He
nt had also received letters, but his constituents
u- requed that arms and ammunition might be
ps fnrniflied them, not that a ftjnding army
er (hould'be sent to defend them,
io If was said, that thi; bill ought not to be
. n objeaed to on conditutianal ground, as
s ? Congress frequently empowered the Prefi
ia dent to do business which the conditution
at had vested solely in them ; but gentlemen
[ie mÂ«ke no diftinaion between Congtefs de~
it, termunng a thing (hall be done, and leaving
c- it to the President to determine whether it
be (hall or (hall not be done. No person hss
eii said Congress could Hot authorize the l'ie
e fident to raise an army for the defence of the
of country ; but it was denied that the power
id could be transferred from Congress to him,
at to determine whether it (hould or (hould
a not be raised. Mr. W. believed the trans
:i- ferring of power from one department to a
at nother, was not only dangerous but embar
sf raffed the proceedings of government. And
if- it was aifo observable, that every indance of
it. this kind was produced as a precedent for
id future deviations, and all objeaions to such
a- t proceeding were opposed by faying, Â«it
be had been done so before."
u- Mr. W. said, if Congress had a right to
ir- transfer this power, he wished gentlemen to
of (hew why they could not also transfer the
n- power of declaring war ; as they had not
g. yet (hewn this, though before called upon to
e- do it. Indeed, he (hould not be surprized
id if this power (hould be a/ked for on some
ie future accafion.
The only difference which Mr. W. could
:1- fee betwixt the provifionai army when raif
n- ed, and the present militia, was, that the
ir former would have its officers under federal
ie aiithori y, and in the latter they would be
id appointed by the dates. The men would
f, in general be the fame. What did this go
if to, but to fay that the militia is not to be
t- truded under their present officers, there
is mud be officers fixed by the general govern
t. ment.
d The gentleman from Conn, aicut (Mr.
l, Dana) had quoted several clauses of the
k Constitution, and made some criticisms upon
it them, and had endeavouted to make the fup
>- porters of the present motion ridicul u , by
representing them as wishing i 0 turn the
i- members of this house into recruiting fer- .
o geants, brokers, tax gatherers, &c. In
n doing this, he believed he had fuffered him
-0 felf to metamorphose the Conditution, so as
s to make it mean any thing or nothing, in.
t dead of construing it in a liberal manner.â"
i- The fame gentleman fays, he (hould have bo
"1 objeaion to raif.- the proposed army immedi
f ately, but thcexpence. Was it not rather
e that he wilhed to place a power in the Prefi
s der.t to exercise, which he supposes he will
1 immediately exercise, but which he appte.
e hende Congress would not be prevailed with 1
ir to exercise at present? For his own part, '
; if an army was to beraifed, he wi(hed to i
1 raise it in the way pointed out bv the Con- 1
r ditutien. It was said that if this army was i
- raised, it might at any time be difljanded, <
when it (hould cease to be wanted ; but
. when he heard gentlemen fay they wifhid I
- this army rather to eonfid of 50,000 men, I
t than 10,000, and knew the difficulty at- '
Â» tending the breaking up of any thing which <
; was once edabliftied, he was deiirous of avoid- <
f ing a measure which he believed to be whol- '
: ly unnecessary. The geographical Sttiation Â«
of thjs count y, said Mr. W. is such, that a r
danding army of 200,000 men would not be
able to defend it. It was idle, therefore f
to suppose the country coold be very much t
benefitted by the raising of 10,000 men. t
â  Bm the gentleman from South-Carolina f
(Mr. Harper) dill speaks of th fe men be. c
ing necessary for the defence of the four hern c
country. That gentleman r-ay think them t
necessary for the defence of some part of his e
date, but he could nbt believe thtm to be ri
necessary for the defence of any part of the
date to which he (Mr. W.) belonged. His t
condituentÃ never wished to fee a danding ar- a
my sent amongd them. Indead of looking j<
upon such men as their defence, they would ii
confidcr them as the greated curse that could d
come upoÃ them. Why, then, will gentle- f<
men continually infill upon these men being p
wanted for the southern dates, when no ft
member from those dates will fay they wi(h la
to have them, except one gentleman (Mr. d
Harper). And though the gentleman p
from Massachusetts (Mr. Otis) was f> ob- h
liging as tÂ» fay he (hould wuVto take the hi
y. fame care of the ftnnjiern ftatcÂ» as the eaf
id tern, he ceuld affiire that gentleman he might
:t mike himfelf perfealy easy a to their fafery.
II Mr. W. concluded with repeating l*te
r, hope that the feeliou would be ttruclc out.
it Mr. Findley said this bill cer ainly pro
ie posed a transfer of power to the Prelident,
y wliich was lodged by the conflitmion in Con
's grefs, and therefore he was opposed to it.â
fe The gentleman from South Carolina denied
"o that the army proposed to be laifed by this
i- bili could be considered as a (landing army,
f- because the bill was only to be pa (Ted for
n three years. Upon the fame ground it might
d be said, that Great-Britain has no (landing
0 army, as their military edablifhment law
le is parted annually. Mr. F. was of opinion,
y that if this bill was now passed, the men
r. could not beraifed ; the officer.-, he had no
1- doubt, would. At ihe commencement of
e our revolution, when every bread glowed
e Â»i;h eathuliafm in the cause in which we
? were engaged, there was a difficulty in get
e ting men. We might, as he'had said, get
y an army o( rfficers, but won! they, when I
â¢- got, be equal to the militia officers ? He ; 1
e doubted it. If the army was to be increased, f i
i- it would be necessary to increase the wages | (
of the men Militia, he said, was the na- j 1
it tural force of the country, and the railing | 1
t cf io ,000 men would not prevent them from j 1
s coming forward in defence of their country, I
e when dinger appeartd. He was himfelf i
e got too old for service, but he had fo'ns <
3 whom lie believed would be ready to fly with
, their fellow citizens to the defence of their I
s country in cafe of invasion. (
After a few words from Mr. Davis in (
~ favour of the committee's riling, and frQm J
* Mr. N.Smith againd it, the quedion on

1 (Continued from Saturday's Gazette.) '
Mr. W. Claiborne submitted to the gen- I
i tleman from Delaware, as a lawyer, whether '
1 the committee could gather, from ariv thing c
. before the house, that these presents made f
r by foreign courts, confided of chains or r
t fnuff-boxes ? He owned he could draw no S
s such conclusion for himfelf. But whatever n
- the present may be was immaterial to him h
e in the present quedion, because he was f (
r convinced that nothing which an European h
, monarch had in his power to give, could l '
1 lessen the patristifm of our late minider, or b
- alienate his affeftions from his country. It
â  was not to the amount of the present, and
whether it was a fnnff-box, or anything f<
1 else, which was a thing of no consequence, *1
f and ought not to have been named. He c
r ohje&ed to the principle of our foreign tl
i miniders receiving presents at all from Eu- q
t ropean monarch* ; this principle be looked fl
upon as the more dangerous, because it "
3 opened an avenue to foreign influence an c '
3 influence amongd monarchs, too, which has b
e always proved the dedruftion of Republics.
t Notwithdandingwhat had fallen from the 0
Â» gentleman from Delaware, he was convinced "
i the gentleman from South-Carolina would 11
e not think himfelf authorized to receive these Â»
presents, without the authority of Cangref, b
1 were they offered to him as a private citizen, â¢>
. as they were certainly meant as a compli- P
e ment to him as minider. As to what P
1 had been said by the gentleman from Dela- Â°
c ware, with refpea to the present of a fuuff
i box, or pidure, being precedents which r<
3 would lead to the granting of titles, what 1
â  he said, was, that the precedent would au- 01
: thorize the application for leave to accept t!
. of a title, at some future period, which
would introduce a difcuflion on that floor, 01
. whether it ought to be received or not, and*
i thereby disgrace the country in the eyes of d
i eveiy enlightened citizen. ni
Mr. Thatcher was in favour of the refo- jÂ°
lutfon. Gentlemen seemed oppejfed to it e '
â¢ on the ground of its edablifhing a prece-
dent for the future. He did not think this P'
objeftion founded; for, as the constitution â¢
does not absolutely forbid the receiving of or
presents, the difcuflion on the,propriety of P'
allowing it in futur? would not be prevented
by the present dccilion. Future louses <"
could refufe or grant leave to receive these lh
presents, and the coHftitution did not ab- 4,1
folutely take away the right. He conlidered
the gentleman who now applied to Congress
as having a natural right to receive a pre
sent except some reason was /hewn to the *b>
contrary. Gentlemen allow they knew of w '
no special reason ; they allow the applicant &
has done the business with which lie was
entruded, well. He supposed, therefore,
that gentlemen mud themselves vote for it,
except they abandon their own ground. \
But the gentleman from Tennessee had hal
said, the resolution ought to be disagreed gra
to, io order to dop the avenues to corruption
from foreign courts. For his part, he Ple
could fee no connexion betwixt a decision
ou this quedion and corruption; for whether }.
it was agreed to, or disagreed to, it would ,
â ot take away the power from miniders to
receive presents, if they were so disposed.
But it was said, that to agree to this re- f
solution, would lead to the granting of
titles. Suppose, said Mr. T. a title (hould wo
be applied for, and leave granted, and a pi "
foreign power (hould create a duke or a
count of a citizen of this country, what r
could it be, but to make him and his pof-
terity for ever ridiculous? AÂ» he saw no
evil which could arise from agreeing to this Â«
resolution, he (hould vote for it.
Mr. R. Williams hoped by the v#te of Stri
this day, the house would get rid of future
applications of this kind. When the sub- Th
jea was fir ft introduced, he was opposed to
it ; but, if the quedion had gone off without
debate to-day, he intended to have voted
for it. From the difcuflion which had taken
place, however, he was convinced it was a
' i'ubjea upon which they ought not to legif-
late, fmce the ading upon it, would pro
duce greater evils than the conditution had
provided againd. He believed they ought A
here to put a dop to the business. If not, i R V
he wmild rather that our miniders (hould be j " Â»
:af- at. liberty to receive all the piefenti offered
fht to them, than that the thing ftould stand
ty. upon its present footing,
hie The gentleman last up, had endeavoured
to shew the determination upon the present
ro question would not set an example for the
nt, future. It was his with to fix a principle
an- upon this fubjetf, and he had no doubt this
decision would do it. ,
ied It had been said, that the gentleman who
his made this application,.had a iÂ«'ght to receive
ny, these presents, without this application
for Wtjr, then, was the application made !
*ht OughtCongrefs to be called upon ever'y year
ng to discuss qneftions which would cost the
aw union 2 or 3OCO dollars, every year, if the
>n, right of receiving the presents existed inde
len pendent of Congress. This, he believed,
no would be spending the money of the public
of in a way which wauld not be very well ap
ed proved. As this was the firft application
we which ha 1 been made since the existence of
;t- the present government, for this leave, it
set was the proper time for Congress to fay,
en they will, or will not countenanpe the praq
rle tice of receiving ihefe presents.. Our mi.
d, j miters he said. would be obliged by such a
;es ; determination, as if the decision wasagainft
la- j the praflice, I hey would no longer be tron
ng I bled with the offers of presents, or if they
>m had them offered, they could, without hefi
y, tation, decline the acceptance of them ; but,
elf if this was not done, thiire would be no end
ins of the business. If this mation fhoultj not
th be negatived, if he should be here, ano
eir ther feflion, he would propose the patting
of a law to authorize our mifiifters to receive
in these presents except there fnould appear
im some particular objection to such a law.
on Mr. Lyon said. he had heard much about
American feelings. He had some of those
feelings himfelf, and they taught him neither
to approve direftly or indirealy of the
practice of foreign governments paying our
to public agents. If the gentleman from South
Carolina had not been well paid for his ser
vices, he should be willing to pay him more;
n- but he Ihculd not be willing to lay this
cr country under an Â©bligatiop to a foreign
ig country, by our ministry accepting of pre
]e fents, or to make similar returns to their
3r miniiters. It was said, the gentleman from
io South-Carolina might receive these presents
â¢ r now, without the consent of Congress. If
:n he chose to ri(k his own charailer bydeing
is fÂ°i Congress had nothing to do with it ;
n hut for Congress to authorize any such
d thing, in his â¢pinion, would be a fliameful
, r business.
[ t Mr. Bayard wonld tell the gestleman
d from Tenneffes on what authority he in
g formed the committee that the prefÂ«Bts in
question consisted of what he had mention.
e ed. Being upon the committee to whom
n this fubiedt was referred, he made some en.
quiry as to what were the usual presents,
d from the European courts, and found, that
[ t in Holland, it was customary to give a gold
n chain and nsedal; in France, a gold fnuff
is hox > and in Spain a pi&ure. It was oa
s. this ground he laid these things were
le of no cotlfequence. Mr. B. then remarked
d upon what had fallen from Mr. R. Wil
d liams, with refpeft to the expence incurred
; e in discussing this fubje<3, and said it had
f, been owing to gentlemen opposing the refo
1, lution that so long a discussion had
i- place, as to the law which that gentleman
lt proposed to introduce, he must fee that the
t- confiitution would not admit of such a law.
f_ But some gentlemen were opposed to tbiÂ»
h resolution, because it was supposed the
t United States would be obliged to recipro-
I- cate the favor to miuifters who were feot to
t this country; and some gentleman had.fciitd
h the occafiea ef faying that few of these
ministers were deserving of any such pre
d fer.t. But because these gentlemen may be
,( diffatisfied with the conduft of foreign mi
mfter* resident here, they ought not to in
jure our own minister, whÂ»m all allow has
t efitr.tially served his country. He did not
. think this the proper place to discuss the
s propriety of making presents to foreign
â ministers. When Congress we e called up
s on to adt in this matter, then would he the
f proper time for gentlethen to make their
] Hand upon it, and fay the allowance should,
s or not be made. He did not think
. the thing followed of course. He hoped,
therefore, \he resolution would be agreed to.
