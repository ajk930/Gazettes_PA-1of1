AN ACCOUNT OJf TUB ftLOPAtSANDA.
fExtradfroma work printed in Germany,
entitled, " Historical intelligence and
Political Confederations, concerning the
French Revolution, by Christopher Gir
tanner, Surgeon and Dodor of Phy
fick." Thfc third volume;
There hath been for some time pad in
almofl all European countries much talk
concerning the Propaganda, a society whose
members are bound by engagements
to flir up fubjede against their lawful rulers, ,
and to promote Qiflentions and agitations in
all European states Hitherto this society J ,
is kitown chiefly by the effede produced by l
it : it consists of two ordetf. or clafTes of :
meo, viz. men of enthufiatlic difpofi ions, ! {
who imagine the r selves to be called to re j t
form the world, and of ambitious, mifchiev- ' a
ous knaves, who flatter the former in orderto t
life them as their tools, and whose wifli it is t
to breed trouble, confufion and diflradion, e
which affords them an opportunity to fifh 3
in troubled waters, and to lay hold on pow
er after*it hath been wrested from the hands c
of those men in whom it had been lawfully J
and rightly placed.
I have taken great pains (even in France
itfelf) to obtai) an accurate account of this 1
club or society ; I found means.tn become
a member of almofl every club irt Paris, e
ven of that famous club of 1789. whose
President was the marquis de Condoreet ; j
and which, to the best ofjpmy knowledge, !
nerver admitted any foreigner as a member ; (;
except myfelf. But notwithflanding all my j
pains, endeavors, and researches, concern- ft
ing the Propaganda, were in vain until
lately, when I obtained by the kindness of l
an eminent man, in whose heart the wel p
fare of mankind is fincere'y imprefled, the g
following authentic account, which I have a
here translated, and by his permiflion com- {v
muni:ate : I have no doubt of the authen- Â£
ticity of this %ccouut. Â£
The club of the Propaganda is verydif- ] c
ferent from the jacobin club, notwithfland- a
ing they are too frequently confounded '
with each other. The jacobins are the flir
rers up of the national assembly ; on the
other hand, the Propaganda are the faduc
ers and stir rets up of th e-whole human race. n
This c'ub exifled as early as the year 1786, f (
and the lords Rochefoucault, Condoreet, aj
arid the Ab';e Sieyes, were at the head of it. e
Their tenets art as follow % and for the p
furtherance of them, their society is eftab- Vl
lifhed as a philosophical order, whose objed w
it is to control the opinions of mankind. To r(
become a member of this foc>ety, it is ne
cefla y that therandidate be either a defen- a
der and promoter of modern philosophy w
(that is dogmatical atheism) or else a man
of an ambitious charader, turbulent aod w
discontented with the government under p
which he lives. When he is, admitted be w
gives his â¢word of honor to observe secrecy ; p
before he is accepted, he is informed that a ]
the number of members is very great, spread n
over all the earth, and that all these mem- Vl
bers labor inceflantly to put any falfe or u
traiterous members (w ho might betray their p
secrets) out of the way. The candidate c
further gives his word of hAior, that he t;
will communicate all information he may w
acquire, to his brethren ; that he willaa- t(
ways defend the people in opposition to the t ]
government ; that he will do his utmost to t ]
refill al! peremptory (by him called arbi- t(
trary) commands, and do all that in him t |
lies to introduce an universal tolerance of all a
religions. d
There are two classes of members, fitch rl
an pay and such as do not pay , they pay p
according to their abili y ; the number of f t
contributing members wtre about 5000, the f (
number of non-contributing members about 0]
50,000 ; these bind themselves to fprtad c(
the dodrines of the Propaganda in all coun- y(
trier, and to promote the designs thereof. p (
The order has two degrees, adfpirants and w
initiate ; the firft is aeqnainted with the
scope of the order, but the latter is also inâ'
formed as to the means the order uses to ob- cr
tain this end. An aspirant cannot be ad- m
mitted into the degree of initiate until he
has undertaken a philosophical million, and ca
can clearly prove that he has made ten pro- ca
fjlytes. The trcafury of ihe order possess- gn
~~ es at present 20 millions of livres, ready
money ; and, according to the last accounts
there will be, before the end of this year
u (179!) 30 millions in it.
1 The order is built Upon the following
principles: opinion and necellity (or need)
are the springs of all human a&ion ; if you
thsrefore can cause the need, necessity,
want, or despondence (call it which you
will,) to spread. you may thereby controul
the opinions of mankind, and will be en
abled to shake all the fyftemsof the world,
even those which seem to have the firmett
foundations.
To delude the Hollander? has cod the
orekrgrtal labour ; but the consideration
thfii fbe blow becomes universal has fuflained
th"Â£m. The plan of the order is as follows :
No onecandeny but that the oppreflion,un
der which some men live (let it be praftifed
where it will) is agreat cruelty 9c calamity,
this therefore must be removed and put an
r end to by the light of philosophy. When
this is done, it will only then be needful to
wait for the favourable period in which the
nunds of mank nd will be univerfully tuned
to accept the new fyflem, which mud be
preached all at once over the whole of Eu
rope. Those who obftina*ely refill this fyf
tera. we must endeavour by persuasion or by
need to renounce their opposition j but if
they perfifl, and are incorrigible, they must
be treated as the Jew 6 have been treated,
and be excluded from the rights of focLty,
driven from among men.
There is another article in the society's
pldh which is no less remarkable ; it is this.
The Propaganda mud not not try to bring
her plan to bear until she is perfcftly convin
ced that the need (want or necessity) exist ;
it would be better to wait fifty years, than
by precipitance to fail.
A rtumerous society like this, whose
members hitherto as yet a& singly, which
accumulates money, which goes to work
fl 'wly, and carefully avoids all precipitance,
j which vril! strike no blow until she is well
, allured of almofl certain success, such a so
* ciety is a dangerous thing ; their progrels
may possibly be fwift, and deliverance out
, of their hand seems next to an impossibility.
The Dutch patriots who fled to France con
1 fidered the Propaganda as thei? chief anchor :
â  Suppose (fay they) suppose then that the
House of Auflria will afford us no assistance,
1 there yet remains for us the Propaganda ;
these are mifiiowaries of this order all over
Holland, and perhaps even already some re-
I gular lorfg-s.
J , In ths club of the friends of the people '
j at BrufTels, a speaker lately exprefTed him
j felf in the following words : tc Kvery where
! 'hey are preparing fetters, but philosophy
! ar| d reason will one day triumph . and the
time will tome when the unlimited, uncon- (
trouled ruler of the Ottoman Empire in the S
evening shall lay himfelf to reft as a despot,
and in the morning shall arise as a citizen." 11
The treasury of ths propaganda receives *
considerable sums from all the provinces of
Holland. C

Sir, ,c
WHILE France, faithful to her decla- Ci
rations of " Renouncing conquest or inter
ference in the government of other nations,"
attended to her own emancipation and the Â«
expulsion of tyrants, leagued for the pur
pose of Treftoring her ancient form of go
vernment, and riveting her former chains ; -
we viewed her cause as the cause of MAN,
rejoiced at her success, aad regretted her '''
misfortunes as involving the interests ofhh- b ;
man nature ; but when a fyltem of offenfive
war, maflacre and indiscriminatepplunderr r di
succeeded to sober and rational defence ; -
when the rights of MAN, the right of pro
perty, things sacred and things common "~
were facrificed to national ambition, and the
power to conquer and extort money, invari
ably furniflied the pretext and juftified the
measures, we seriously lamented that a re
volution so glorious in its commencement,
unequalled in the extent and celerity of its
progress, should terminate To little to the
credit of the principal a&ors, or real advan
tage of that magnanimous people : if these
were our feelings while difintsrefled fpeda- f c
tors of the conduft of France, what must c <
they now be, when she, having exhausted Ji
the blood and treasures of Europe, is ex- 31
tendingherviews to this government, and by tl
the mÂ»ft unjuflifiable and unprovoked fpoli- 31
ations on the property of its citizens, is P
draining her principal sources of wealth and 0
revenue, and by insidious appeals to the
people against the government, calculated to
foment divisions in our country, preparatory
for the iQore easy introdudion of her plan
of universal disorganization and re- J
ceptioa of that eonftitution or form of go- j t(
vernment, she may please to didate at the
point of the bayonet, arts already pradifed ~
with too much success in Europe.
Under these impressions, Sir, we would B
do injustice to ourselves in concealing the ft,
entire fatisfadion we feel, at the decided
measures adopted by our government in re
fpeft to that nation. Can France,, intoxi- p,
cated as she is, seriously believe that Ameri- ve
cans having so long c joyed the blelfings of tic
an efficient government, *'h;ch happily th
3y 'combines (he greatest personal lib'riy.
its vidua! ifcuri'y, and national honor, tat ti
:ar feÂ£t of a most enlightened policy and price
of the dearest Wood of their fathers, tould
lg poflibly be induced by promises or threats to
d) j abandon it, but with their lives ? Noâwe
ju i declare to you and to the world, the conlli
y, J tution we have adopted we will transmit in
-3U violate to posterity, or perifti in its ruins ; it
ul I is not for us to fay, whether war is or is not
n- neceflary ; conftitution of our choice has
d, delegated tjie decifien to a different depart
:ft | ment. Peace, honorable peace ! we rank "a
mongft the firft of earthly bleflings ; war we
he view as the scourge of human nature ; this
Jn however we do fay, our persons & property
ed are Inbjefit to the call ofour country ; either
3 : or both are ready to be facrificed in her de
n- fenc.' in manly oppofitioo to invasion or Ra
ed tfonal insult, either from the long accredited
y, despotisms of the old world o the gorern
an ment of Fiance regenerated-Really the most
:n energetic despotism, concealed under the
to new-fangled appellationof citizens direftors,
lie and the advocates of liberty and equality.
:d At this trying crisis, Sir, when tlie most
be efiential interests of our conutry may be at
u- Ibike, when the secret enemies of our most
â f. excellent conftituticn begin to (hew them
iy selves, when the most falntary measures
if adoptedby our government, arc mifconftru

f, motives ; when foreign enemies are calcu
lating on our internal dtvifions, and domestic
's enemies are laboring to realize those calcu
s. lations; we esteem it our duty to add
g (however late the declaratian) that in at
-- taehment to our country, in obedience to
; her laws, in refpeft to the cha: after and

we yield to none, and only wait his call to rally

The Dublin Mail of the 25th inftaat, ar

not only a confirmation of the dreadful ac
counts given in our last paper, but also forpe J
important details of several frefh aftions li
which have taken ptaee between the milita* te
ry and the rebels in various direftions.â ai
Ihe rebellion is now openly supported in r<
most parts of the counties of Dublin, Kil- cl
dare, and Meath ; aSd ever, the neighbor- S
hood of the metropolis has been aflailed by
the daring insurgents. In some instances, tl
they have made a desperate resistance ; hut tl
in all they have been completely defeated Y
with immense (laughter, while his majesty's in
forces have sustained very little loss. Near ol
Dunboyne, the rebels, who captured the

By the Dublin mail of the 26th, which la
came to hand yesterday, we have received Â«f
accounts of several frefh actions having been cl
fought between the military and the infur- w
gents, in the whole of which his maiefty's er
forces have completely triumphed. ~ The in
rebellion has extended its influence into the
counties of Wicklcw and Carlow; so :hÂ»t th
S there are now fire count 'et- in sn open ft i
of iofurre&ion. The official details of t
of the engagements., which took place

âºj, at Baltinglafs, in the county of ,Wicklo
ys state that the rebel? loft in the former this
re hundred men, and in the latter between o;
f e and two hundred. Battles have also bet
m fought at Clare, Ballimor, Berretilowr
> Lucan, and Lufk, which terminated ia i
similar manner. The Rebels have burnt the
town of Kulcullen, and destroyed a great
j. part of the refpeftable city of Carlow, at
which place a dreadful conflift took place,
. the result of which was, that four hundred
of the misguided wretches were slain, orer
)r whose mangled carcaies the travellers from
rc Dublin to the southward were for a whole
e day obliged to pass. Such is the frightful
n pi&ure which our intelligence of yefterdajr
presents to our view.
But this is not all ; our advices from the
south state, that the county of Kilkenny ig
j in a very perturbed situation ; that the
greatest apprehensions are entertained in the
counties of Tipperary ond Waterford ; and
0 that in the county of Cork, an open rebel
lion is hourly expe&ed. The vicinity of thÂ«

The official intelligence which has arrived
from Ireland since lour last publication in
some measure answers pur expectations, and
gratifies our hopes. A numerous body of
rebels assembled Â©n the Curragh of Kildarc,
(amounting to 40co)have laid down their
arms, and given up a number of their leaders;
that the communication between Dublin and
Limerick, which bad been cut off by the In
surgents, has been reflored ; and that Sir.
James Duff hat retaken the town of Kii
dare, and killed between two and three hun
dred of the Insurgents, who had poffefiion
of that place, with the loss of three men kil
led, and several wounded. The Gazetteadds
that " the outli is'entirely quiet." We are
sorry, however, our letters from thatquarter
do not admit us to fubferibe 'o this last as
sertion. The rebel. Â»we are on the contra

Yesterday arrived the Waterford andDonaug

proteiled by a numerous body of horse; and
eigTit pieces of artillery, and the sea is in their
rear. Here they intend to make their grand
stand. They have their apprehensions, and are
determined, at any rate to fell their lives dearly

into the sea.

and I have to inform your Grace, with infinite
concern, that the rebels in that quarter have af

march againfl this body, and I hope they will
be met and defeated, i have received accounts

not close this letter till the last moment of the

To such of the Deluded People now in Rebellion
against his Majesty's Government in this King
dom as prof est the Roman Catholic Religion :
The underftgned Roman Catholics of Ireland
feel themselves earnestly called on to remon
ilrate with such of the deluded people of that
persuasion as are now engaged in open rebellion
against lÂ»is majesty's government, oa the wick
ed tendency and consequences of the conduit
which they have embraced. They apprehend
with equal horror arid concern, that such delud
ed men, in addition to the crime committed a
gainst the alleigance which they owe to his ma
jelly, have in fame instances, attempted to give
to their designs a color of zeal for the religion
whnÂ»K they -profefs IâThe1 âThe undersigned profefs
equally with them the Roman Catholic Religion
âsome of them are biftopsof that persuasion,
others are heads of the leading families who pro
fefii that religion, and others are men of the
fame persuasion, who, by an honorable indultry
have under the Constitution now fought to be
subverted, raised themlelves to a fitujtion which
affords them, in the most extensive sense, all the
comforts of life Tile underlined of each de
fcriptien concur in entreating such of the delud
ed who have taken up arms against the eltablifh
ed government, or entered into engagements
lending to that effcÂ£t, to return to their allegi
ance âand by relinqui/hing the treafonablc plans
in which they are engaged, to entitle themselves
to that mercy which their lawful Governors
anxiously wish to extend to them. A contrary
conduit will inevitably fufcjefl them to loss of
life and property, and expose their families to
ignominy and beggaryârvihilft at the fame time
it will throw 011 the religion, of which they
profefs to be the advocates, the most indelible
stain ; on this point the unfortunately deluded
will do well to consider, whether the true inter
ests and honor of the Roman Catholic religion
are likely to be most considered by the Bilhops
of that persuasionâby the antient families who
profefs that religion, and have refilled eve
ry tsmptatipn to relinquiib itâby Â«nen who at
once profeffing it, and .submitting.to the present
Constitution, have arrived at a itate of affluence
which gratifies every wifii or by a'fej <:F des
perate and profligate men, availing themselves
of the want of education and experience in
those who they seeK to use as inftrum'ents for
gratifying their own ivicked and interested views
âat all evsnts, the underligned feel themselves
bound to rescue their names, and, asfaras in
them lies, the religion which they profefs, from
the ignominy which each would incur from an
appearance of acquiescence in such criminal and
irreligious conduit ; and they hesitate not to de
: clare, that the accomplilhment views of
the deluded, of their peifuafion, if effedled,
muftbe effected by the downfall of tlieolergyâ
of the ancient familiesâand refpeilable com
mercial men of the Roman Catholic religion.
The undersigned individuals of each of which
description, hereby publicly declare their deter
mination to stand or fall with the present exist
ing Constitution.
The private advices received by the Mail yes
terday state that tranquility has been restored in
the county of Kildare, by the submission or re
duiftion of the insurgents in that quarter. Some

themselves on the mercy of General Dundas,
and promised to repair the bridges which they
have destroyed ; while others assert that they
were surrounded by the King's troops, and niade
prisoners.

FRENCH PIRACY.
ExtraS of a letter from captain yobn Crust,
late majler of the brig Sally, of this port,
dated Baltimore, Ju'y 30.
â¢' J have again experienced a fate similar
to that of my last voyage, being captured
by French frigate La Decade, and sent in
to Cayenne, there condemned both vessel
and cargo, in the mofl injuftifiable manner,
and .nyfelf and crew lurned ashore without
a farthing. In this situation I made
application to both the commander of the
frigate, and the cemmiffary of the port, for
a small part of my advent ure,to support me,
or even part of my cabin stores, that were
left, but was by them treated with an eye
of contempt, and rcfufed even to a biscuit.
This treatment might only be expected from
the most uncivilized, and savage nation, but
at prefeut, I compute the French to be no
better, as they certainly are possessed with
neither the principles of men, nor the .feel
ings' of humanity. Liberty, which they
firft â¢ontentfed for, is now changed into
greater fiavery than in the reign of any of
their kings, as never was there a monarch
yet ever reigned, tVat was invested with so
much power, as the Dire&ory's agent in
Cayenne ; he has both the military and the
civii power in his !Â«mds, and can put to
death whom he pleafe's, without any trial ;
several instances, which had happened just
before my arrival, by his ordering several
black soldiers shot f6r only complaining of
their allowance of provilions, not being fuf
ficient to support them.âAmericans were
treated with disdain, and those of the inha
bitants that were any ways disposed well to
wards them, were forbidden .conne&ing
then.selves with them.

&c. were fecurtd, together with a qaartity
â of the coin, in its unfi lifhed stateâthe dies
are well made, and appear to be the work
of some hand /killed in coining.
It appears that they have been engaged
in the biifinefs for three week past, but we
do n?t Icara that any of their coin has been
in circulation ; federal others were engaged
in the business, after whom ftrift search is
making by the con'iables and other civil
.officers, and wi doubt not, they will soon
keep company with theirbrethren, who are
already secured.

O'Coigley, a clergyman, has been executed in
Ireland for high treason.
When he arrived at Pennrnden Heath, to which
pla e he had been conveyed in theufual manner 00
a hurdle, he-proceeded to read some latin andKn
glifh prayers. After reading about five minntes,
he tÂ«ok an orange out of his pocket, and then a
penknife ; but his arms being bound behitul, he
could not cut the orange ; upon which he beckon
ed to a friend, who attended him, fayingâ" Cut
this orange with my penknife : It has been said
they would not trust.me with a penknife) le?. L
fheuld cut my throat; but they little knew that 1
would not deprive myfelf of the glory of dying
in this way."âHe desired his friend to keep hi*
penknife lor his fake, and' to hold fbrne of the
pieces of orange, all of which he ate ill d'e course
of his devotions. Alter he had finifhcrf the long
prayer, he kneeled inthe hurdle, anrifunga psalm;
He then repeated another prayer to hinifelf, witii

I. Common lufurances, on hazards of the firft
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout
halt per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
! C _ rifques a larger premium will be required, which
will vaiy according to circunftances, seldom ex-.
" cceding one per cent, per annum ; but in some iÂ«-
1 (lances, where the property icfured is not only in
l j" itfelf extrahazardous, hut rendered still morefo
ut by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will bs raifcd
or according to circumllances.
I e Houses and Ware-Houses, thÂ« walls and psrti

0 f is required to be insured in one tenement, an addi
Â»d tlona l premium will be required, in proportion to
circumftasces.
at 11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and
0 f goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
I to the risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or claHes, so as to describe
each with the necessary accuracy. Each cafs mud
â  ' therefore be decided upon according to the circum
stances attending it ; and these circumftanccs will,
1 in general, appear from the description accompa
uying theapplication.
Buildings partly conftruiled of brisk or done,
.r are preferable to those wholly wooder. And in
" both cases, the stile of buif-linc, how they are oc

n buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
it be taken into view. And with refpeft tÂ® goods,

e from the manner in which they are exposed, either
n, to comnience or to increase an accidental fire, and
y their liability in such slate to receive damage by
y wet, or by sudden and hasty removal, or to'be fto
e len in time of confufion and hurry, are all cir
cumflances of weight; and the premiums motl be
proportioned accordingly.
'II. The fellowinr; conditiont are to be under

? penfeÂ«than the payment of the premium of the re
newed tcriti,the circumftanccs continuing the fame
a as they were Bnderftood by the Insurers at the time

. of the premium is essential to such renewal ; and
f if the party insured fuffers any time to elapfc after
f the expiration of the former infurajree, before he
pay 9 a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
f during such time; sor can the infurarrce be renew
