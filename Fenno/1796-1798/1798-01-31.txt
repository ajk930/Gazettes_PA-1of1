his Nor,. Mr. Chairman, do T think the gen
re tleman from Virginia (Mr. Ercnt) has been
are very fortufia'e in the choice c 1" character
hi- which he has made to invabdate the truth of
to an dbfervntion which h.js' been frequently
-er made, viz. that the Executive had in 110 in
or- fiance deviated from fucb rule,in the appoiut
ay ment to office without having melancholy
ict cause to lament it. A* this gentleman lias
he thmight fit to bring more immediately into
le- view this chamber, which be fi>yÂ» i 3 well
>m known, to have -been frequently alludej to,
tig during the present debate, I thereto might
rn, fafely concede all that he has, intended for
ne him on this occasion, without being con
ife fTdered his pauegyrift: I might admit with
0- much truth, that we-mve our present fituati
:r- on with the French republic to that gentle
y, man, and if it will be any gratification to
ife the member from Virginia (Mr, Breut) of
ly those who have pursued the fame political
if- ine of condu&, lam willing to allow thetu
of a participation of those meafurca which have
re produced this situation. If this fituatiou
nc is as the gentleman from Virginia has iniinu
if- ated an enviable one, if it is one on which
- we have abundant caufeto felicitate ourfclves
er then, Sir, I agree they ftiall have allthe cre
id dit which their efforts so well entitle them
e- to: if, on the contrary, this situation is such
r- as every friend to the interest, the honour,
1- and the peace of the nation hasreafon to la
o ment; then will I not dispute with them the
e obloquy and cehfure which their conduct
le may justly merit. This is a question which
d I undertake not to decide, ill the language
fe of the member from Virginia (Mr. Brent),
>- I leave it to the underftandiug and fielingc
it of the country to determine.
y Wbilft taking notice of the observations
of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brent)
d I cannot omit obfervisg upon the unfair
statement he has made of the remarks of the
o member from Conncfticut (Mr. Grifwold)
g uponthe fubjtftof checking thegovfrijment.
e If I understood that gentleman, the didinc
-0 tion which be took between the system of
f the member from Virginia and his own, was
- elear, explicit and intelligent: he admitted
n that checks were to be found in our govern
- ment, but that they were checks operaiiug
- within each department, he denied that the
- departments were checks upon each other j
e and he went on to exemplify- and explain his
- bisdiftinflion in a manner which could not
r, be mlfnndcrflood, but by the cor.fufed ideas
3 of that gentleman upon the fuhjecl.- He
- contended for instance, that the legislative
- department had sonftitntional cheeks with
- in itfelf; that she house of representatives
> Was a check upon the Senate, the Senate
t a check upon the house of representatives,
and the Piefident, who inthis refpeft is a
' conftituentpart of the legiftiturehas a check
1 upon both : that in theexecutivedepartment
the Senate was a check upon the President.
But hedenied that the legislative department,
was a check upon the executive, the execu
tive upon the legislative, or tither upon the
judiciary. His ideas upon this fubjeil Iwill
admit were very different from those of gen
tlemen who advocated theextraordinary doe
trine of checks, introduced into this debate
by the mover of the present amendment
The checks contended for by those gentle
man are intended to produce an eternal (late
of warfare and hostility between the several
departments of the government, that con
tended for by the member from Connecticut
(ivfr. Grifwold) is designed to promote har
mony and a co-operation of t&e departments:
according to those gentlemen's system, the
moment of harmony, conciliation and uni
on is the moment of danger and alarm.
That moment the government is in such a
situation as that it can aft with any valuable
effedl, iÂ» the time to found the alarm, is the
moment for this minority to exert themselves
in stirring up internal war and diffention in
the departments. If I believed with the
gentleman from -Virginia (Mr. jfccholafe)
tliat such mud be the operation of republi
can govcrnmonts, I fliould then agree with
him most readily in another opinion which
he has expressed, that republican govern
ments had a strong tendency to deujotifm
and tyranny, for I will venture to afTert, that
out vX Â£vfb confufior,, such disorder, such a
warring and hostility of departments either
anar-bjr or defpot-'rni mii'i- nrcrfnrrr^
fhpjtjy arrive. But. Sir, I fear there* Uz
little probability, ot the appreheniicn of cbV
member from Virginia being realized in th:,t
harmony, union and co-operation of the de
partments which I consider so dcurable in
our government, and so necessary to irsufe
ful operation, so long as.he fliallbe a mem
ber of either of the departments. Accord
ing to his own principle a it will be his duty
to keep a watchful eye upon their approach,
to this point,, and to founi the alarai: and
though he fiiould he one of the virtuous mi
nority in this houic, I no doubt but he
is fufneieatly ktiowrt out of this house to at-traft attention,, and ir.it '/e wjll speak lopd
enough to be heard at le .'. by the minority
out of tljofe wnllt. If l/ouldfte strong and
alarming fyinptoirs of7a harmony of this
house with the Executive department at this
time, I might Se able to account for the a
mcsJment which is ri>w under consideration
and the style of the obfervatians with which
â¢ if was introduces!, I might in that cafe, be
able to uudtrftand why the house of repre
fciitativts is thus to be drawn up in battle
array against the Executive.
I will now notice a few of tbe remarks
of gentleman frpm Pcnnfylv% lia, who
was lalt uo (Mr. Findlcy) and then con
clude. This gentleman, in the commence-
B roeiit of his speech, complains much of the
_ personalities of some members of lh:s house
in the prcfenl debate, and Â»fjJj*iard names
rr â cnllrd; h<giMMML6Â»~
llnej this lame ipeech in 3 ftiT* ,ot abute ana
cr'mination, but little calmtlpted. tn correfi
the n ichief he complains of,; He (aid in
one breath, thÂ«t the favorers of the present
amendment, are reprcfeneted as wishing to
overturn the government, and in the next,,
he a Tens it is well known that there are men
in this hyiifc, who consider the executive the
government, and he attrihutefi the observati
ons of some gentlemei. to their profeffional
habits at coun r y court hars ; from the pro
ficiency which this and some other gentlemen
have discovered upon the present pccafion
in this Itile of declaration I am induced to
believe there are other schools besides coun
ty courts where language of this kind is
taught.
But, Sir, this gentleman has made ano
ther complnint, which rathei deserves *obe
laughed at than ferioofly attended to ; it is,
that we have taken up much time in disput
ing abi.ut s principle when we ought only to
' have cuiifider.d the expediency of the mea
sures propufed, and he has insinuated this as
a ufua! tr ; ck with some gentlemen in this
houf . I consider.this attempt tolrepanthe
house, md lead from the real question, as a
trek indeed, but a very (hallow one. Does
the gentleman pretend that the principle in
, this cafe must be fettled before we oan come
to the expediency of the meafiire, and that
any difctifllon of the expediency without a
denial of the principle is an express admijjion
of the principle? That to admit the right
of he house of representatives to legislate
or deliberate upon theexpediency of thepre
fert measure, is tÂ» concede the principle
contended for, in all its latitude. But when
gentlemen arc pre Ted hard upon the real
â¢ queflion in dispute, they thri endeavor to
elcape bv puttjfiÂ£ it out of fight, or by nar
rowing their ground ; and for this the gen
tleman from Virginia (Mr. Brent ) who was
l.iit up, credit. He has endeavor
ed to the prefenc amendment as yet
more Imrrnlefsâas 011'y contending for a
ri xht, in the House of Repiefentijtivts to fix
the qiiellion of salary to officers created by
law or the couflitution. I do liot be
liev the mover of tbe present amendment
or theft who immediately followed him in
fnjyport of it, from the ground which they
then took, and the full disclosure they made
of those obje&s and intentions for which I
am willi.ig to give them credit will thank
those gentlemen who would nowreduce the
question to a mere nothing. Has the pre
sent amendment ever been contefled upon
this {.-round, unless by those two gentlemen?
His he right which'they cl-iim ever been de
nied? if it haslhave not heard itâhavethofe
wl.ofuppo.tthe-prefent amendment,pretend
cdthat the allowances which have heretofore 1
been to our foreign minilters 'nave ]
been too high? Do they wish that a min- I
ifter plenipotentiary or charge des affairs, 1
ihc.uld hive Id's ? I have not heard i> con- t
tended, but the objtjc u is profelfed to be,
by rec'-t fig the appropriation, to â¢ reduce t
the grajle of office at two of the courts, t
and to compel .the Prtfident to' recall thfc v
minillers at another, and not to reduce the 1
appropriation, hfcaufe the present allow
ances to the fecntid grade of officers is too d
high, and ought to be reduced. It has 0
been explicitly avowed, th?t it is further c
intended by degrees to destroy entirely, our g
diplomatic eftublilhment. But fir those c
gentlemen cannot-be serious in their declar- si
ations upon this fubjed, for they have both t<
conte ided (not with (landing this declaration g
of their view of thefubjeit) with 3?! their p
talents, for the rftablifhment of the very o
pi inciple which the opp fers of the amend- 1
merit fay it involvesâOne other obje& may t
be obtained by thus weakening the impor- n
tanee of'the present dispute, to wit inv a
pressing the people with an opinion that h
the opponents to the amendment have pr#w f
duced an unneceflary wade of time and 1
money, which would be indeed irfexcilfable f
if the contest was only about the favitig of t
a few thousand dollars. c
But the member from Pennsylvania, (Mr. t
Fi'idley) has made another attempt equally 1
hardy in contending for the right of the le- i
giflature to efiallifh and create the officers of <
ambafladons, foreign miniflers, kc. and the 1
manner of supporting his point convinces i
me of a truth which he has complained of 1
as applicable to others, to witâthat he was 1
not addressing himfelf to the understanding
of this house, but that he intended hisob
fervations (hould have an efFeft where the
detection of their fallacy might not be so
easy. He has read from the constituti
on the claim giving to the executive, the
right of appointing ambafiadora, "foreign
tninillcrs, &X.- and he has tline ar
gued, that as the legislature nctwilhfland
ing this general grant to the executive, hag
claimed and exercised the right of creating
Â« the office of judge, so they have equally
the right in the cases of foreign minitters,
See. I cannot attribute this misrepresenta
tion of the fimilr.rity of the two laws to the
gentlemaft's ignorance or want of informa
tion, for he niufl havefeen in this fame con
ilitution an express grant of this right to
the legiflaturein the authoritygiven to them
to establish a judiciary fyllem, in which the
right of creating the office of judge is ab
folutelr eSenttal ; but can the gentleman
i find any such grar,t in tbe cafe of foreign i
ministers in any part of this inilrument, and
1 would it not have beert as easy to fiavc ex
s prefTed it in one cafe as in the oftier, if the
s framers of the constitution intended the la
- giflature (hould pofftfs the right. a con
-1 tend the office of foreign miniiler is create d
1 by the constitution to be filled at the d;fÂ«t>
e tion of the executive as circumitances and
the the country may require,
e But.as the gentleman :s conlcious he can-
Hot find any fpecific grant in the conlliiiiti
s on of the right in this house to legiDatt
0 upon tbe expediency of r> ducing our diplo
matic eftablifbment, be has availed himfelt
of a very old plea to support his claim, a
e plea th3t has been constantly resorted to to
e uphold the uioft extravagant demands, i lie
5 gentleman a(ks, has not the legislature the
n'jht nf An 3 under this
d right he claims the one now contefled and
1 may claim 2ny other belonging to the gov
n ernment with equal pretensions. As we
t have the right of declaring war, fay thoft
0 gcntlemeft, all others follow as incidental tc
~ this general power which are in a6y degree
n connefled with it, and as incidental to this
e they ha aparticipation inthi; treaty
- making povver ; they now claim a controul
1 for our diplomatic eftablifbmeut, aid may
. with equal propriety take into their hands
1 the entire fufserintendance of our foreign in
i tercourfe and connetlione. So optheir claims
j under the right of appropriation what the
- v.ar right leaves tfrc appropriating right
s takes, and thus the Home of Reprefenta
tiyes strips the other departfliient3 of the griv
- ernment. The gentleman in retnarkiiig u- 1
â  ponwhathe calls a requeft,and he mi'ghthave
, laid in many instances as an apt quotation
- 1 from a favorite author,, viz- the tendency of
> certain meafares toJ}op tbe â¢wheels of Govern- j
- men!, obferveg that the donia of the right j
i which is claimed in the present instance to
> the House of Repfefentatives is flopping j
one of the wheels of goveinment. If it is
L a wheel, it is a jlfih wheel'which does not
i belong to the political carriage, and which
he is attempting to clog it with contrary to i
the original design of the and I
will fay against my consent, for I declare I !
am not so much attached to the fafhionable \
novelties of the day or to new fangled inven- I
tions as to reeiive this upon tbe bare recom- i
mendation of the proje&ors. I believe it !
may do harm and can do no goodâit may â¢
impede the motion and progress of the ve- j
hicle to which it may be attached and may j
eventually overset and dellroy it.
This gentleman has also followed the ex- j
ample of all those who contend that power |
can be trusted no where but in the House â 
of Representatives and has argued against !
the executive's exerci'fe of it from the pof '
iible alufe of it. He has contended that it
would be dangerous to give the power to j
the executive to create officers because he 1
rnight abuse it with a view to the service of
his friends, and he has quoted most of our
(late governments to (hew the extreme jea
lousy and caution with which they have de
legated the power of appointment to office,
he has also urged the opinions of man of
talentÃ in the convention of this (late which
accepted the present constitution, to fup
poit .the plenitude of power in this houie
under the right of reje&ing money-bills
fn this instance also the gentleman has fol
lowed the common error of ail those who
have attempted changes" in the conftitHtion
in any other than the constitutional mode.
They undertake to make a constitution and
not to execute oneâthey enquire wh?re
power ought to be lodged, when they (hould
be examining where ittis depofitcdâwe art
not ntfw in Convention to pass upon this gov
ernment, we are not discussing the qUeilion
where the power of creating and appointing
to. offices would be bed .and most (afely en
trulledâbut we are limply to determine
where it is to be foundâl believe it is wife
ly pteced where I contend I fee it.;
It has been insinuated in the courfeTif the
debate, that the executive hadexprelTed an
opinion ;hat the right of creating the offi
ces of foreign mmifters, &c. was in the le- '
giflature. I fee nothing to juftify this ,

to the present day, has been expressly a,- |
gainst a concession of this right : and the 1
practice of the Jegiflature haaheen equally 1
opposed to the claim. Can gentlemen (how '
in instance, where the legislature have crea-, ,/
ted an office of this kind ? Has nof the u- 1
niform praftice of the executive been, to '
appoint to office, and then call upon the j
house not for a creation of the office, but c
for an appropriation for the -offiter. In the 1
late million to Paris, did the executive con- 1
fult this house before he made the appoint- ,
men'., to know whether we would have 1
one or three commissioners ? And was his 1
right to determine that question disputed, '
when, we were called upon to appropriate ]
for three commissioners ? Is it prhpofed to 1
qutftion this right which the Prefiijent ha? 1
thought himfelf authorised to exercife,-dur
ing the present session, in the appointment
of three commissioners to treat with the
Cherokee Indians ? The appointment has
beep made without consulting us ; and I
have not supposed it would be disputed, or
the appropriation.
But as some extrads from the speeches
of members formerly of this houie were
read to the committee, by the mover of the
amendment, with a view to (how, as I un
derstand, that the ground now contended
for by the opponents to die present amend>
men*, w;'s not taken early in the govern
ment. And as the; gentleman from Virgin
ia (Mr. Brent) has expressed great uoeafi- :
nel's and alarm to find from the reading of
these txtrafts, that the opinions now ex- i
pre(Ted by some gentlemen, are but of a
late date, that they have changed with a
ehange of views, and that there (hould be
such a want of consistency in their conduft. 1
I (hall beg leave in conclusion to read to
this committee a few extrafts from the con
gressional register of the debates and pro- !
ceedings in tbe firft congress, as a coÂ»pleat
i

i- upon thi prefeut fubjed, it. ratjier attashes Â£

If the txtnd of she proceedings and debate '

le 9I expences attending Indianttre- t
te witch bill contained a clause direding t
is that cem-ni'TÃibncrsi, not exceeding three, a
d 1 Ihpuld he appointed, and allowed compcn- f
i.-,t t 11, &c. \\ T heh the bill came under the 1
re ' cmi&foat&h 'if thi house, a member, Mr. ,
ft Sedgwick, made a motion to strike out c
c that part of the clause, retraining the num- t
â e ber of commillioners to three, on the ground c
is that it was an unt onllhutional interference t
y on the part of the house, with the eiiecu- 1
il . tive authority ; that th* right of laying
y [ how mjiry commifTioners there should be ap- ( -
s pointed, belonged to the executive alone ; (,
1 and that this house have nothing to do with t
j it. The question foi ftr king out the clause i
e after debate, was carried. Mr. Craik ob- v
t served, that the mover of that amendment,
- for ftrikingout the clause, was well known
- to have always maintained a steady and u
â¢ ! niform opinion upon this fubjeÂ£k ; and Mr. t
e Craik observed he was authorised to fay, f
1 that a member then* from Virginia (Mr/ p
f Madison) whose opinions the supporters 1
- | of the preferit amendment, generally res- r
t pefted, seconded the motion of Mr. Sedg- J
) | wiyk, which was then the fubjeit of dif- v
f ! ctifiipfi. Mr. Crsik took notice" of a part h
a of the debate where Mr. Smith, then a (
t member of the hhufe, whin speaking upon f
1 the question, asked the house, " what was
i ; to be done, supposing the United States

; Mr. C. Claiborne wished to offer a few reasons f
p : for his vote oinhii question.
I He watclea ibat the House had 1 right to reftrift r
r ; our diplomat!, appointments, so fir as 1 dated to the
appropi i tiajiof money j and he w*Â» convinced that 3
. thc food of tSecouitry required an exertion of that t
rtghi 011 the pvfent oeofion. 1
â¢ He was cawinced also that that part of the Confti
-1 tution which ad pieced the care as the Treasury in r
1 th# haods of he Houle ot Reprefcntati*es, had great
ly recommenced it to the people of the United States; {
and ii ever tba valuable deposit was patted with, the
â  affeflions of he citizens toward; the government
. begreafis ieffcut-d ; and tie funlier believed, >
that if it were oj)e of the political tenets of the gen- t
tleraao jjft fit down, (and his arguments declared it
â¢ to be so) that the doois of the Treaftiry, so Har as re
lates to foreign intercourse, shall al>vay& be opened at 1
the ivcJl of the Executive, that this very honourable r
gentleman and his adherents would not long be the c
favou i e Politicians of America Hut candour im- r
pelled hiÂ» to declare, that the faring of a few thou
(md dollars was not his chief motive in supporting V
thiv amendment. He contidered it of ioft-iitely more
mp otanceasa check to the giowth ot our foreign
Poll ical conne&ionsâconneQions which he had for
fever*' years viewed as d ngerous" to the welfare of F
this Country. c
Si uated 'as the Uuifed States are, at a great diHance (]
from the transatlantic wotld, unambitious of con
quefls, andlHelTird with a government formed by the e
people, and highly pleaiing to a large mijoiity of 0
them, what, laid he, have we to do wi h the politics t
of Eur pe ? Vt i hthat con inual contusion and war
fare occjfinned by the co ftjnt dffire 'o p/eferve thÂ« *
balance of pown, so .neceffjrt for the exiftente of "
Imall nations, furr. unded.at they are byjm re pow
erful na ionÂ» ? These were evils wrueh called for the t
fj mpathy of. the fvieft set lings of humanity ttor dif
tiefs i but they were â¢ vents with which we, as a na- 3
lion, had nothing to do. It was our concern to pre
serve harmony with all nations ; to follow 'he pÂ»ace
ful i.urfuit ol our apiculture; to affo d to our unof
fending comttlrrce such a proteflioTi as we are ena'hled
to do without oppfefling our agriculture; tjut to keep t(
alool from the uÂ»tri*Â«es and deHgm of taropÂ»n G
priwres as well as repub ics.
With this view of the ftibjeflt, he (W no netefTi v
for this extensive p)liticiJ m'ercourfe He brliev-d c
it was of no use. Was it found that when England tl
d-termined 10 dcfpoil sur commerce, it was in the v
power of dur minister there o prevent it ? Or, if o
ther maritime powers were disposed to do the fame,
could our minilters avert the evil ? He believed not.
Bus had not our. foreign political coouefiior.f been at
tended with ferioui evtls ? To what was our piefent
critical firujtish owing but to this ? What, more than
this, tended to produce quarrels with foreign govern
ments, and of courle to endanger our tranquility at
home ? He appealed to everv experienctd man, whe
thei we'had any thing more to fear than this.
But were there no further mifchief* to he appre
hended from this policy ?v\ ould not foreign poli
ti a be introduced, which might bring about a
change of sentiments and views in country ? O
Win this desirable for - mcrica ? Or would it net o
rather prove the bane of its liberty? Amongfl the
things moss to be or was h-Wev r, the n -
t-oduis}.i trof a foreign interctt- inta our councils.
And ought we not, he afced, to dole every door tl
to its entrance, as a precaution to secure
our freedom and happintls? He'whs of opinion a
that this was thetruell policy which Americacould .1
â¢ purlu*. 11
The committee had been told tkat this was not P
the proper time to retrench our diplomatic corps. ! h
But theianie gent'tman had Europe as con- ! tl
vulfed to its contor, as disregarding the law of na- r.
tions; where t-ey Hate villainy as riding trium
phant, and where the priric!J>lti of meralify and W
> virtue had but Kw fupj orters. If this were true, "
surely no time was more proper than the present h
to reduce pnfent establishment.; for, if the tl
, times were so iniquitous, what possible gcod cou d j,
â¢ : honest Amifrisan miniflers render to their country
1 from a refidente in those countries. D
The commnte'e had alio been tofd by the gen
â¢ tleman from Delaware, that so great was the 1"
thirst for conquefi in those countries, that, for n
' aught he knew, a compatfl might' r*ow be mak- 3
ing to enflwve America, and he adduced that as t'
a reason for continuhig what he called our /ton- f
orablefpits abroad. lq a little circle of one of
the countries of Switzerland, on a queftidn like 0
â  this, fâch a fugjefl:Â»,J might be entitled to some
little weight; but, upin th s floor,*i? was not v

an htcHneySd phrase, an awful lejfaa to the

For I'';s oven part he was furp-ifed that this

fne ohUrviiions oi the gentleman from
Oe irgia hid had confutable weight on his
mud That gentlVmart liatt, from experience,
- informed jh * committee what look place under
the confederation. In the infancy of Our na

he tal3 them txperiencefoori'evinced that i: was

a;fc6ntiÂ»ue<r.' i uii v. ..Â» il/c of 'x/k'ri
eace, which he greatly relied up, n. '
1 he gentleman from Maryiaiidjuft fit dawn,
complained ot abuse from gentlemen fav outing
the amendment; though he believed every th,iog
of this kJod hid ("ome fr im the opposite quar

And here he yepu'j remark, Mat w.V.ii t!>e ob

have been pointed out; as, making the obferva
t on without pointing out the persons, was an
illiberal Â»i)d ungenerous general reflet ion Who
was it that said, that the present question was,
" the government and the people on one fide,
and the gentleman froorv Virginia, and his friends
on the other ?
Did that member suppose, the favourers of
the amendment, were less independent in their
sentiments, and less friends of the American
people than he was i When he looked round
thar corfimittee, amongst the friends of amend
ment, he saw men who ranked high in the efti
rr.ation as the American people, whose charac
ters were well known, and it would be heard J
with aft nilhment that a doubt injurious te them
had ever been entertained in this hÂ»ufe. Mr.
C laid, he believed the'time he had allotted him
felt was expired, and fat down.
The committee rose and had leave to fit a

(Debate to if continued.)
TUESDAYâJANUARY 29.
The bill appropriating money for hold
ing a treaty with the Indians claiming land
in the dates of Tennessee orN. Carolina, was
the third time and pafled.
Mr. Dwight Foster from the committee
of claims, made a report unfavourable on the
petitions of Edgar and M'Comb, claiming
lands of ths United States, which was read
and committed.
Mr. Findley presented the petition of fan
dry citizens of the four western counties of
Pcnnfylvania, praying for compensation for
damages sustained from the troops of the
United States during the iufurreftionâRe
ferred to the committee of claims.
Mr. Harper presented the memorial of
Thomas Hutchins, praying for an addition
al compensation for the services of his fa
ther, who was gtographer general to the
United StatesâReferred to the fame com
mittee,
Mr. Sitgreaves said, as it was yesterday
said that the rules for the house refpe&ing
the appointment of committees Hid not an
"pfy to itic-prelent cafe, it would be well for
the houfc to fettle a quell ion before it pro
ceeded to the ele&ion of managers of the
impeachment which might arifem the busi
ness, viz. whether a majority or a plurality
of votes were to make a choice. He there
fore proposed the following resolution,
which was agreed to by the house.
" Refolded, that in the ballot for mana
gers Â©n the part of this heufe, of the im
peachment against Wm. Blount, a majority
of the whole number of members present
fnall make a choice; that if more than elev
en members (hall have a majority eleven of
of the highest shall be chosen; and if any
two or more members having a majority of
votes and (hall be equal in number, the fame
shall be decided by a new ballot."
The sergeant at arms proceeded to colleft
the ballots, which being done, the speaker
appointed Mr. D. Foster and Mr. Jones as
Tellers.#
Hating examined the votes, (which took
up nearly two hours), Mr. D. fofter repor
ted, that the Tellers had performed the bu
siness uffigncd them, and found "the whole
number of votes to be ninety-one, and that
consequently 46 made a choice, and that
the following nine gentlemen, and no more
were elefted, viz.
Mr. Sitgreaves 76 rotes.
Mr. Bayard 69 do.
Mr. Harper 65 do.
Mr. Gordon 62 do.
Mr. Pinckney 53 do.
Mr. Dana 52 da.
Mr. Baldwin 48 do.
Mr. Sewell 46 do.
Mr. Hofmer 46 do.
Mr. Baldwin said, that perceiving fomr
of the committee which had formerly afted
on this business, did npt possess so much
confidence as others, he should beg the
house topxcufc him from serving as one of
the managers of the impeachment.
Mr- Brooks thought it was curious, that
after having obtained a majority of votes,
the gentleman from Georgia should com
plain of not having the confidence of the
ljoufe. Did the gentleman expeft to receive
the whole 91 votes? Except a better rca
fon was given, he hoped the gentleman
would"not be cxcufed from serving. He
was aftooiftied to hear the reason which
had been given. Did the gentleman wish
the voice offeeble minorities to (hew confidence
instead of majorities? If so, his wish would
not, he believed, be the wish of the house.
Mr. Baldwin said the gentleman from
New-York had misunderstood him. He did
not fay that he did not possess the confi
dence of the house; but " that some mem
bers of the committee appeared not to pos
sess so much the confidence of the house, as
others."
Mr. Thatcher asked the numbtrof votes
which the gentlcmjt* from Georgia had re-
CCtvfd. On being informed, !, â¢ !, aped tfcc
gentleman would withdraw his motinn
'nice he wonld fee that nooeof
house CnUre coafid * nce of the
,Mr Baldwi, said he had stated the rea
fonsi of his request, and hoped the sense of
would be taken upofc it.
Jt' P [ nckne y hSP'd the qutftion would
a 7 ueftio Â» could have
coroe before the house, or, which members
fhonld have diverted thÂ«mfelves of all idea of
party, this was such an one. He Hulled
there was a general wish in the house to fift
this matter to the bottom. If be under
ftond the gentleman from Georgia, his ob
jection did not ar.fe from his not having had
more votes, but because another mcmb-r of
the committee was not j B
hi. objeihoÃ at thiÂ« period, ft W,â¢ com- â 
P e. Ihe house had yet a furffur ballot
to
be elected, and then, coirfilU-nt with his
own reelings, he might fervZ (Vf r . p. fog
he was himfelf unw.til, and not in the house
when the ballots .vere collected, or he cer
tainly ihould have voted for all the members
or the committee.
Mr. Baldwin perfiftedinhiemotion,which
J was carried, ther* being 48 vrttes for it
A new ballot then took place fcr three
additional members. The votes having been
collected, tha tellers counted them as bef re
and reported the whole number of votes was '
91 ; but that no member had a higher num
ber of votes than 37, and confequeritly that
no election had taken place. Messrs. Daw
fon, Dennis, Gordon and Gallatin had the
highest numbei of votes.
Mr. Gordon moved that the choice of tire
four remaining managers Ihould be postpon
ed till to-morrow.
Mr. Gallatin hop#d not.
Mr. Bewail wirtied the business to be pcft. 1
poned, as by to-morrow gentlemen might
reconcile their differences of opiniou on the
fubjec*. He wished it also, beeaufe he had
a fubjeft to lay before the house, which ht
thought of importance to be fettled bdore
they separated.
Mr. Macon was yesterday in favour of
adjournment; but experience hadconvinced
him he was wrong. He hoped the bufinefÂ»
would be proceeded with.
The motion was negatived 55 to 35.
A frefh ballot was then proceeded with ; ;
which, upon the votes being examined, prev* '
ed as before, a nullity, no member having a
majority of votes. We believe this time
Messrs. Dennis, Evans, Gordon and Galls,
tin had the highest number of votes.
Mr. Harper hoped the farther proeted
ing upon this business would bÂ« postponed
till to-morrow, that gentlemen might have
an opportunity of underftaading each other. â â â 
The motion was carried, there being 4S
votes in favour of it.
Mr. Sewall rose to bring forward the bur '
finefs which he had mentioned; when
A motion was made to adjourn, which
was negatived, there being only 13 votes
in favour of it.
Mr. Sewall then said, he believed the bn
finefs which he had to lay before the hw&jj
would require fecrefy, as it was a fubjeS
jshich would CQnfidcrribVv affeÂ£t~tlic feoiiiwj

fore mcved that the galleries might be clear

VV obtaining Warrants for Bounty Lands, due K
to the Officers and Soldiers of the late Continental
Army, by the predu&ion of forged tmlruments. IV
| To check in future such impositions. it has been
thought advifeable ; that all pcrfons, having claims ec
for bounty lands, whether in their own right, as cÂ»
r legal fcprefentntive, or by virtue of any instrument er
or deed of transfer, be required to forward their at
j rsfpeftive claims to the War Office, on or before fe
1 â¢ the firft day ot January 1799 in order that such o!
' ' claims may be duly examined, adjusted and deter- n
mined upon
To fuhtianyate such claims, a ftriil observance oi -
! the rules heretofore issued from the War Office will
be ir.difpenfable ; and in addition to what is requir
