MONDAY JANUARY IJ.
j th The bill from the Senate, to rompenfate
their door-keeper and his assistant, was read
,j )C the third time and pafled.
f The Speaker laid before the house a com
er_ munication from the Treasury Department,
inclosing tke accounts of the Treasurer of

was Mr. Tillinghaft, agreeable to-the notise
!OV , he gave on Friday la(t, proposed a refolu
,rfe tion for the adoption of the house to the *
caa following effeft:
, l rr (S " Resolved, that a committee be appoin
tjt ted to bring in a bill for the purpose of re
pealing the aft of Congress past the last fefÂ«
fion, laying a dirty on w stamped vellum,
four parchment and paper."
, Mr. J. Williams wished this resolution 4
rich might be so altered as to go to the cemmit
30d tee of Ways and Meant, who having the
ae ;d fubjeft of Revenue generally under confi
)f a- deration, were,' ot' couTTf, the judges
as to the propriety of repealing the aS in
question. But before the resolution was re
it ; s ferred, he wished to amend it by adding,
â¢|; ns r also an aft laying an additional duty on Salt
ones, imported into the United States." His
r out reason for wishing the resolution to be thus
' ve âf amended was, that when the Stamp aft had
him. been agreed to, a proposition (which had
before been rejefted) was brought forward,
reaf- towards the close of the feflion, when many*
â ared of the members were gone home, for lay
-1 will ing an additional duty on fait which it was
tilen- said was neceflary to iland against.the stamp
cax which would fall principally upon the
commercial and monied part of our citizens,
iving If therefore, a repeal of the Stamp aft /
of e- which chiefly affefted thole interests was to
tllica- come under consideration, he wished the fait
they tax, which principally anefted the Agri
they cultural interest, alfp to be considered, and
(v, as that both should be referred to the Commit
:nded tte of Ways and Means together, that they >
nS- might report upon the whole fubjeft at the
rable, fame time.
ifeafe The Speaker declared the motion itor a'
v (ink reference to be firft in ordet.
Mr. Harper hoped the resolution would
not be agreed to, as he held a report in hiÂ«
;ftion hand on the petition from Virginia, paying
tom- for a repeal of the Stamp aft, which ot
iftera- course involved the fubjeft of this refolu-
'
but, a tion. .
. jujtf Mrs'? Rutledge truftid the resolution
f cor- would not be agreed to. believed it
was of more importance than it fetmed to
be considered by the house j as it did not
of the propose to appoint a committee to enquire
voufly into the expediency of repealing the law m
id the question, but for the special purpose of re
g per- porting a bill for the repeal of the law..
which Had the former mode been adopted, lie
ad for should not have objefted to it.
jure in The Speaker observed that the mÂ»tion
or the was to refer the resolution to the committee
n, un- of ways and means, who would of courle
vil has report upon the expediency of the measure
Kinr, proposed.

ord. consideration of the resolution tlntil t<>-

Mr. Harper, from the committee of ivays j
aÂ«d means, made thereport (which. had been j
alluded to) on the petition of certain free- j
holders of Somerset, -Stifles and Prince 1
George, in Virginia, praying for a rqjeal
of the Stamp Aft. The report ft sted, that
in the opinion of the committee of ways
ana means, it would b^,inexpedient to re
peal tlie said aft, and that therefore the pe- l._
titioners have leave to withdraw their peti- J
tion. This report was referred to a com-- j
mittee of the whole, and made the order
for Monday next.
Mr. Harper, from the famfc committee,
to whom was referred the eftjmates neeeda
ry for the service of the year 1798, report
ed a bill providing fi>r*the expences of the
Civil Department of government for the
year 1798, which was twice read, and re
ferred to a committeeof the whole for Wed
nesday.
Mr. H. also reported, from the fame
committee, a bill providing for the means
of intercourse between the United States
and foreign nations, which 'was committed
for Thursday.
Mr. Liviiigfton called up for coniiderati
on and decision, the resolution which he laid
upon the table a few days ago, for the ap
pointment of a committee of enquiry into
the expenditure of the money which had
been appropriated for the naval service.
The House agreed to take up this bu
siness.
Mr. Harper said, he believed that the ap
pointment of such a committee was very
unusual, without having fomc ground dated
to the house for the proceeding. A vote
of thru kind, he ahferved, would imply a g
censure upon the conduft of our public of
ficers, which certainly ought not to be done
hastily, or, without firfthaving, at lead some
ground of suspicion laid before them upon
which to aft. The house had not yet re-.
ivi.'d the statements which had been called
for relative to this buCuefs ; they were di
rected to be laid before the house the lad
Week in January, and might therefore, soon
l>e expected. Â£Several gentlemen said it
was thefrfl, and not the lad week ia Janu
ary, in which the accounts had been order
ed to be laid before the house.] Mr. H.
said the delay,, he supposed, had been oc- .
cafioned by the offictrs having been objiged
to remove from the city, during the fever.
He hijd, however, been informed th?t these
statements would be ready in a few days.â
And would it not be extraordinary, if, be
fore they received these statements, they
were to appoint a committee of enquiry ?
He thought it would. He believed the of
ficers of this department of goverumcnt
were very desirous of the enquiry taking
place ; but this was not a i'ufficient reason
for the house to proceed in the business
wtihout having firft fom? ground to suppose
the money had been misapplied, and this
he believed cpuld not be afcertainedg until
the expefted iUtements were before "the
house. 'AMlgp -thrCt wm lanWH it
was possible thehoufe might be fatiified with -
refpÂ«ft to the expenditures of the money,
and it would, therefore be improper to ap
point a Committee to enquire into a busi
ness, which might so shortly appear fatis
faftory. If, on the other hand, these ac- _
counts flieuld not Ue fatisfaftory, he would 1
readily concur in the appointment of a com- t
â nittee of Enquiry. j t
Mr. J. Williams said, the gentleman from t
S. Carolina ought to recolleft that the en- t
quiry was produced by Is farther appropria- t
tion being called for. It might be best to j
defer the enquiry, until the accounts which Â«
had been called for were laid before the c
house; and he ihould have been fatisfied 1
with the business taking that course, if a {
further appropriation had not been called f
for in the mean time. But when they were
called upon ts appropriate a farther fun of
money for any objeft, it was natural to en
quire what was become of that already vo
ted; and the only way of doing this was to
appoint a committee who would look into
all the different statements which had from
time to time, been laid before the house,
and those which might shortly be commu
nicated, and date their opinion thereon to
the house. He thought those gentlemen 1
who were mod friendly to the frigates ought
not to oppose the appoiatpaent-of this, com
mittee; because if it (hould appear that the Â£
money had been justly expended, there Â£
would be little objection to a farther appro- '[
priation.
