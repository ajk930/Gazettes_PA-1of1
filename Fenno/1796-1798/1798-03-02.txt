HI. FCNNO, A
The is a copy of * letter I received
fruri a genrlcman in Connecticut, with hit ile
fire to >2rt it published in yÂ»ur paperâl perfeive
the diiti it ounterto the general correal of your
paper, ai.d it, that operates a> a realon that you
will not five it a place, I will tend 10 morrow
ibi 1 lie copy. X 2.
Decus has made some animadverfleos on the
fracas between Cnl. Lyon and Mr. Grifwold,
which calls forth the Centiments of the people
of Connecticut ; and we folieit you to insert the
following I 1 inures. In the firlt place, wc ob
serve that Grifwold isepithited with Mr. while
col. Lyon is totally diveiltd of title. This dil
ceveis to us the partiality which printers, edit
oii-or.-fcribblers have no right to. Col Lyon
has his couifuiffliun as commandant as a regi
ment, aud with propriety ought to be ftiled
colonel. 'l'htn you proceed to fay, " that an
unmanÂ«yrH rufllan has offered Mr. G.' an inl'ult
never to be endured," and has puritanically bur
thened the house ef representatives of the Unit
ed States %ith the affront, and thereby expe&ed
to rcl'cue Mr. Grifwold from â  jult punifbment
for his utgentlcmanly and insolent behaviour so
c'' Lyon, hy repeating his wooden sword insult.
Had col. Lyon ever been dwelled of his rank in
the army ;nd ' een caQTtered,for cowardice con
leqjently intitlidtoiheenglilh dubbof aknight er
rand, and thence haveattached to him the idea of
wearing a wÂ®oÂ«len sword j if a state in the U
rion had heen pleafrH by thtir fuffragesto have
honored him witk a feat in the legifljture, it
was ill besoming an individual to have branded
the whole (late with a stigmaâbut as that is Wy
no means *Â» appendage of his tbarafier, it was
cruel in Mr. G. to fay it, and childilh in him to
repeat it. The only apology which Mr. G. ean
viler is, that ke has been bred and educated in a
puritanic (late, where <words de not authorise
b/ons, and where the legislature have proteiSed
thtmfelves from injury by enalting severe laws
a ainlt dueling, the particular hijlory of which
Buy come up in future. But the legislature of
Connecticut did notexpe<sl by their ai\
duelling, to extend it to congref3, or beyond the
limits of the state ; to befure, while within the
limits and boundaries of the state, tbry have
powerfully defended tliemfelves agaialt any at
tacks in which their indiscretion or wintonnefs
may involve them.bnttheyhadno ideas of extend
ing it further than thetr puritanic borders. It
would amuse the ftatespehaps, to give them an
history of the eaufe of the law ; but as it would
drive us too far from our purpose, we (hall on
ly observe thar it might be numbered with the
blue laws. Grifwold, thns educated, might
plead privilege, md fuppofc himfelf authorised
to fav rt/ytthinp, and be by law prote<sted from
affjuit or injury. Col. Lyoti knowing the puri
tanilm of the state, iniglit wave the firft apgref
fmw, but ci U ii not the fecund, without impli
cating himfelf in the reality of' Grifwold's fup
pofttirn, and 1 hereby rendered biml'elf worthy
a wooden sword. But hwwever the matter
may turn in congress, whether col. Lyon be ex
pelled from the house for (pitting in Mr. Gril"
w<.ld's faee or not, we beg leave to affare Mr.
G. that we did not fend him 10 congress to abase
or icfitlt the members, and we molt heartily re
pent ourchcire of a man, who had folittl? know
ledge of the world,as toaffrontamember of that
honourable House, by an alTe tion, a question or
insinuation so dire>3ly injurious to his feelings.
Wc have no idea of running down atay charac
ter â vVe expeft that reaftn, argument and laws
wi'.l liipcrcede all other ccnfiderationa. We
had no idea of lending you, Mi. G as a cham
pion -ef Connecticut; we deleft the condudl
which you have been guilty of, we pity your
putrility and want if urbanity, and will reform
ourchaiie.
The true charafler of large bodies will never
be known from individual! who compose them ;
much less thai of Rates, from the individual
who represent them. Were wÂ« iw characterize
them from th.-fe circumllances years ago,
we fliould haveluppofed Georgia to have been
xhade up of cowards and desperadoes ; the Ca
rolinas of duellifta an.t pafade gentry ; Virgi
nia of Cincinnati juntoifts and demotrats ; Penn
sylvania of Pennies and broad brims ; New-
York of gallants and bubbles; Connecticut of
drifts and athei'ls ; Bolton of courtiers and
giniblets , while Vermont alone retained the
iru* Amtrican charafter of plain, honest, fenli
ble men. So also were we to judge ef Con
gress by th ir ails, we might fuppefe our finan
ees eftablilhed, our revenues infinite, oar politi
cal situation a source of envy to Europe, and of
/importance to the world.
Do we wi!h to derive a true knowledge of
fads, we fly to newspapers. But alas, they are
contradictory and salaciousâOne fays our na
tion is resectable and refpeCled abroad, while
another details the injuries and insults we daily
fufler from foreigners. So aad reflux
iog are ail things, that a Date sf reft and certi
tude is not tha lot of any of the works of God.
As the heavenly bodies arc afluming diurna'ly
and periodically the:r oppolite extremes, so alio
as it were from humble imitation, do all men
an!#iags vibrate from one, extreme to the o
ther as if impatient i f reft or liability, much leli
of permanency and duration. As in the natu
ral so inthr moral world, doc all nature rulhfroifi
one toils nppofite extreme; and itfeemsasthough
il *as the ltudy of the rational world to accele
rate the movements ofthefe vibrations, and hur- 1
ry to " their vast cxiremes." Nature seems bu
sy in effeAing those extreme*, for quickelt
growths most quickly decay. The most beauti- '
tul flowers wither the quickelt ; the Hat- 1
licft oaks the hcavieft fails, the most deli- 1
cioui and excellent carcases the mill oflTerilive
fmtlls ; and isit not caufc of grief anddifagreea
ble reflections, that ma>i, the noblest work of
God, (hould be subjeCted to the truth of (hefe
observations I Is it because Adages pronounce
thtt " reformed rakes make the belt husbands,"
that gallantry hasfo many advocates ! Is it ne- I
ceflary that impiety (bonld he a prelude to de
votion, and honesty to the making a fortune by
swindling to' the diftionor of human nature? -
Namberlsls examples juftifv the generality, if
not the universality of the obfervarion I'hat
misers (hould beget fptndthrifts, and vice versa,
ia not strangeâthe reafens are obvious ; and
that external integrity (hould be made a John
<le Baptist ; the foujeft knaveries grow out of
the grneral jargon : for who that has read the
great volumes of nature's productions, but will
fubferibe to these truths ! I lessee, when we fee a
large eflate amrffed by the penury and the inde
fatigable in uftry of one, frequently lavilh*
ed by another generation. When I fee a large
edifice I pity its tenants, or a small '-ottage I en

kingdom, I fee miserable cit gena, but in a new j
world, happy pea/ants ; if I fojourii to <he In

I wants to buy a farm cheap ; if decrying th

neu.l hear he is married ; if a man be prove:
bully poor, he is soon mounted in his coach, an
[ if immensely rich, I look ferhis name 011 th
l:(t of bankruptcies. So general are the vibrj
tions, that we almeft that one extrem
growi out of the other. An oppreflive goverr
mem by a revolution begets a free one. and th
free government pants for an energetic oneâl
this flux of sentiment, as of tidea, the fentinnr
tal world has its periodical revolutions, aimoi
as periodically fixed thofe of nature. Wjji
this exordium, which 1 will meet the aflent 0
every critical observer, may we accoun: for th
fracas thai happened in the reptefentatives
chamber ddring this felEon, between col. Lv
on and Mr. Grifwold. Grifwold, habituatei
to the ebbing and flowing of lemiment, wilhe
to accelerate their movements, while col Lvoii
regarding the constitution as an eligiblejian
dari of rights, privileges and benefits, withe
above all things, to fee no innovation upon thi
principles of dtmocracy which brought it in:<
beingâhe being born under the government o
Britain, and educated in the full belief of thi
extension of the prerogatives of the crown, i
ardently desirous to check every movemen
which in iCTue (hall alter tho tone of the respeCt
ive branches, as permanated by our ble.Ted con
Oitution T and that he (hould feel with mori
weight the dangers of oppreffiun, is rational
when wc consider his native country, and theii
wretched and unalterable fittiation ; and thai
his whole foul (hould be engaged to suppress anv
and every thing which in Hie vibrations of go
vernment, tend to impair the liberty of thepeo
pie. Ar.dmaywe not rationally infer, that il
he has not the abilities ef the meltable orator
to produce his sentiments and give the air of rcf
peitability, in a well connected chain ofreafon
ing in a set fpeeth in the house, that his mental
powers will he ever awake to acconaplilh the ob
ject of his million by means within his reach ?
No one who is acquainted with col. Lyon, but
allows him poflell'ed of (trong mental abilities ;
and on the footing of accomplilhments, let us
a moment cor.traft the combatants. Mr. G.
brought up at the foot of Gamaliel, and having
received a polite educj, : -in, was one of those cha
racters from whom â  ought to cxpeCt polijhecl
manners, while col. Lyon tifpiresio 110 greater
elevation than that of a plain honcft man. Un
der these itnpreflions, where di cs tile rudeness
or manr.ei's commencemelt afluredly from
Mr. G's ungenteel interposition. 1t would have
been eIU-eaned rude in Mr. G- to have interrupt
ed the <!ol. in his observationsâbut horridly
rude and barbarous to insult him and rep ated
ly, with a stigma which was fabricated at the feat
of government. The world- expeCt more from
a pi.lite gentleman than from a ruflic farmerâ
the insult by Mr. G. was therefore doubly for
cible, and yet Mr. Grifwold's Decus ftilei col.
Lyon ' in urimannerd ruffian, "as unrefpeCta
ble,"di(hosorahle and tilelefsâAf Mr. G was
the reverse, it was too poir.Ledly partial to gain
any credit. " Sunk in the fltb of arty" Mr.
Decus, do you endeavour by fucb language, to
animate the house to revenue as a. body ? So
diring an outrage aa that committed by your
lelfor your friend, where did the party com
mence ? We fay under combination of govern
ment, under the banners of which Mr. G. has
ingloriouflv enlisted ; and because col Lyon did
not wish to facrifice the republicanTfm of the
state he had the honor to represent, by gtafping
after and [laytaiitry of Eaftcrn courts,
Mi". G/volunteers to dubb with cowardice a
military character, and has his reward.

LONDON, December 21.
Last night we received the Paris journals
to the 18th inft. they are chiefly filled with
the fetes and rejoicings complimentary to
Buonaparte on his arrival in Paris. The
dinners and balls given by the direitory, the
ministers, the members of the legislative
body, See. ate very numerous ; and the sen
timents exprefied at thein are full of exul
tation in the victories gained over the ene
mies of the republic, in the eontinental
peace, and of vengeance against the Eng
lish government. Preparations for attack
j ing this country continue to be made with
Cl,er gy> and every opportunity is seized by
the dire&ory ro inflame the â¢ resentment of
Fritnce.
An unfounded report has been circulated
in Paris of an attempt to poison Buonaparte
and some of'the members of the direftory. "
Mentz iVto be surrendered to the French
on the 31ft mft. and the emperor is to take
pofleflion of Venice the fame day.
j But the most important article is the let
ter from the new king of Prussia to the
French republic. In this letter, is contain
ed "sentiments of peace and amity towards
France. His majesty (hews himfelf a wife
king: He is not to be seduced from bis
duty t<s his fubjeÂ£tÂ» by the delusive promi
fesof an English minister, nor the tempting
offers of Englilh gold. The whole conti-1
nent of Europe is now at peace, and we
believe it out of M r - Pitt's power to dilurb
I its repose. England alone ha 3to dread
the ravages of war.
They write from Vienna, of the 30th_of
November, that the emperor was indisposed,
for some days, with a violent cold, which
has brought on a fever. Hopes, however,
are entertained that his health will be (hort

the Prussian minister, has officially notified 1

COLLET V. MARRIOTT. J'
This was an action to recover from the f
Defendant the amount of a policy of irifu- Ir
ranee on the (hip Argonaut, driven on shore P
.and wrecked in Simmon's-bay, at the Capr Â®'
â¢of Good Hope, the 2d of Oftober lad.
The plaiatifPs cafe was opened to the jury c '
(which was special) in a very elaborate and w
.able manner ; but its merits will be bed ex-
plained by the deposition of the principal t- f ll
vidence. 11
Lord Keith deposed, that he was com
mander in chief of the naval force at ihe
Capcof Good Hope, on the 2d Augud
lad, at which time the (hip Argonaut,under tc
the command of the plaintiff, arrived in the
bay, for the pnrpoft, as he underdood, of .
getting water and provisions. Hearing that 1
an American veflel had before landed some j
men who behaved in a disorderly manner ; vl
and being in hourly apprehensions of attack
from the enemy, he thought it advifeable, "
tor his majedy's fervicj, to lay an embargo Â®
on all the (hips in the bay, aroongd which
the vessel commanded by the plaintiff, was w
of course included. On examination of the ill
lhip, aud its papers, flrong fufpfcions arefc, of
â corroborated by the circumdance of the vef-' at
itl having icveral paffsngerson br.ard, and co
particularly a Frenchman, of which tke w.
jC] csptain could g've no other account than
Â»e 1 that he was an emigrant bound for the Mau
ritius. All danger being removed, on the
If 19th of September the embargo was lak.a
a- off, but the plaintiff's (hip was detained as
' â  an '/licit trader, hit papers and his other de-
It derations dating that 114 intended to trade
i- to Madrafs. The pi aiutiff made a proted
as being an American, and several retnon
t- (trances, but without effect, as his lordship
ic was not then apprised of the ratification of
1- the new treaty between this country and A
c- merica ; and knowing that it was-his duty
n "tij. detain it tinder the navigation and several
r other prior aft 3. Capt. Collet never com
if plained to him of the want of any
>â¢ or dotes, or he would have ordered him to
e be supplied, and his lordship frequently of
is fered him to take the charge, and be ref
ponlible for the fecuritv of the vessel, if the
captain rifigned the command. This the
latter declined complying with, and the
y mailer attendant (as is usual, in all 'he ports
'â¢ Europe, Asia and America) was direÂ£t
:, ed to take measures for its security. The
(hip was accordingly removed to a part of
1- Simmon's Bay, which, in his lordship's o
c pinion, was a place of the greated fafety.
it When the vessel was detained as an illicit
u trader, his lordship direfted the supreme
3, of Judicature to inllitute an enquiry
.- into all the circumflancee, which the witness
1- means to transmit to the admiralty in vindi
y cation of his own conduct,
e The examination of capt. Collet by the
1- court of Judicature at the Cape of Good
1- Hope was then read, in which he dated that
e he was born in the Isle of Man, but had re
e sided and was for thirteen years an inhabit
y aÂ»t of America. That he was entruded
y with the ship and cargo in quedion, fitted
- out by himfelf and Mr. Butler at Philadel
if phia, to trade to some ports of Europe and
d the Ead-Indies. That he arrived at the
y port of Loudon, and waited there till the
II conclusion of the treaty with America, which
allowed the vessels of the latter date to trade
r to the Ea!l-Indies, pioyided the vessels only
â¢ dealt upon their original cargoes. He made
1 his policy of insurance accordingly, and
s failed to Bourdeaux, to Leghorn, to Madei
f ra, and to the Cape of Good Hope, where
his veflel was detained and destroyed.
r Evidence was brought to shew that the
- Argonaut was taken pofTefiion of by a mid
l (hipman and fix others, who took it from
f its moorings, and in that operation had cha
s fed its caljle; and that it was driven on fiiore
) and dedroyed on the 2d of O&ober.
s The captain of the Ruby said, that he
Â» had sent some men on board the Argonaut,
- wha removed it to a fafer anchorage than
- where it was before; and that he had un
derdood it was dedroyed on the 2d of Octo
ber.
Mr. Law irr behalf of the defendant, de
. chned any argument upon the condrudion
. ef the American treaty, or the quedion ar
, iling from what was called in law the " re
draint of Princes." The quedion for the
. Jury to consider was, whether those who
, for good reasons took pofTefiion of the Ar
. gonaut, had any intered in deffroying it?
Or whether it was not more likely to pro
r ceed from plaintiff himfelf, accused of being
. in an illicit trade, and againd whom pro
. ceedings were at that time going on, the
. event of which was likely to be the confif
cation of his vessel and his cargo.
Mr. Erfkine, for the plaintiff, cantcnded
, that from the evidence, the loss of the Ar
gonant was owing to those who deprived
, the Captain of his command, and conse
quently the defendant was liable, as the pol
icy insured againd the redraint of Princes,
as well as the dangers of the seas. He
highly applauded the conduit of his noble
filend .Lord Keith, whose meritorious serv
ices wonld f-ver be remembered by his coun
try. His high fenie of honour would set
h m above all suspicion, or otheiVife, in
his Situation of Advocate, he had a right to
demand their hesitation on the tedimony of
a witness who might be ultimately called up
on to make good these damages. The de
cifionof this quedion wns of the very high
e(l imporiÂ»nce, as or. it might depend the
continuance of peace and amity with the
Americans. He was not much in the ha
bit of applauding the present Minider; but
U j ice obliged him te approve those enlar
ged and extended views, by which, in the
American treaty, he counterafted thenar
row policy of the house in Leadenhsli dreet.
I he minider was and ought to-be aware,
that the opulence of England did not arise
from the poverty of its neigbours; and that
in proportion as improvements in arts, com
merce and manufactures were made in fvery
quarter of the world, in the fame propotion
would be the advantages derived to Great-
Britain. It wasno doubt upon this consider
ation that the r ith article of the treaty al
lowed the Americans to trade to India, fub
jeÂ£l to his reftridtion, contained in the 13th
article. The treaty allowed them to trade !
in all and in any of the ports of Indodan, j
provided they confined themselves to their i 1
original cargo,Jand did not carry on a coast- j
ing trade. It was not proved againd his 1
client that the commerce he was engaged in 1
was illicit. A party of men from the Ru- 1
by had taken the command of the vessel, ; I
had altered its anchorage, and changed j'i
its cable. The loss was clearly by res-! ]
l yi' nt Princes, and therefore the plain- { 1
tiff was entitled to their verdict. j <
LordKenyon faid,thatgreat deference was <
to be paid to the opinion of Lord Keith, <
to whom he paid many compliments. That 1
illudriout nobleman was placed in a fitua- 1
tion of extreme importance and difficulty, c
It was necessary foi him to use the utmod 1
vigilance and caution, and the more he f
hazarded in such cjrcumdances, the gredter f
was his merit in the difcljarge of his duty, c
But though the evidence that the plaintiff' 1
deprived of the command of his ship was I t
without any proof of his being engaged in 1
illicit trrffic. The construction of the aft 1
of Parliament was a fubjtft which he (hould 1
at present abdain from difcufilng ;*but there c
could be no doubt the l-.fs of the vessel c
was owing to the reftniint bf Princes. ]
1 The verdiift of the Jury tiÂ»at tlielofs
- of the (hip was owing to the reftrair.t of
e Princes, which would enable the plaintiff
1 to recover the amount* of his .policy; but
s the quedion W3S referred whether he traded
- in such a manner as was confident with the
; fair condrufiion of the articles of the late
I treaty between Great-Britain and America?

Sir,
The certificate refpedh'ng the unanimity
of the committee felefted to try the late con
teded eledUon,conne<3ed with the paragraph
quoted in Mr. Fenno's paper of yederday,
from your paper of the 22* d of February,
places the clerk of that committee in a fin
gubr function: For, if it befuppofed that
110 other person than the clerk was privy to
the debates on t ) le f evcra i points in quedion,
before the committee, and this so far as I
know is the faft, it seems to follow that in
formation from the clerk is " the bejl autho
rity," if not the Â»nlj authority on which that
paragraph could have been founded. I claim :
110 right to demand of-you on -what authori
tyyou published the paragraph; but you
will perceive that the situation in which those !
publications place me gives a fair claim to a ;
direst declaralion by you, that the para- '
j graph is, or is not founded on information
derived from me, directly orindireftly, from

vertiser.
Messrs. Adams,
As I am not one of *hofe who are per
fuadtd that every well wiiher and apologid
for French politics, is, of coiirfe, an ene
my to the intereds of America, I wish,
through your nfeful paper, to fugged a few |
1 coqfidcrations that may induce such citizens
; to review their sentiments upon this fubjedt, .
! an d enable them to determine whether their '
opinions be the result of prejudice or of ra
tional convidlon. lam willing tomake con-
allowances for the effeft which
fplend;d Ticleries, and high protedations of
philanthropy, are calculated to produce up
on the human mirid. The fir ft throws a veil
over the mod brutal enormities, and the se
cond are but too fuccefsful in imposing up- Â£
on hearts conscious of. the lave of liberty ""
and of mankind. But, when fa*ts are dai
ly occurring, by which alone the finctrity
of protedations, and the advantages of sue
ccfs can be ascertained, does not common
sense fugged, and candour require, that we
fhotild look at thefe.fa<3s, examine their ten
dency, and calculate their consequences? E
We now mufl fee, if we will open our eyes,
that nothing short of universal empire, or
universal prepondcrancy in thecivilized world Â®
is likely to fatisfy the ambition of France. I
Hrt - plan* arc avowed, her vad projects of
dominion arcporppoufly displayed in the face â¢ S
of the universe, and the lofty dreams of j f,
Louis XIV. (he is determined to realize on o
2 | botli "ides the Atlantic. Let th; partisans
f los this nation Tefieil whether it be tli -V
[f ( wish to be swallowed upinthe mighty whir!
t | pool. Whether they wish to fee Aifticrica,
J | the peaceful feat of feeurity and liberty,
e j the- gentle narfe'of human hap.pinefs, the
e afylam of the wretched, the parent of equal
J lav.-s, the pattern of political integrity and
, wisdom, the birch place of our anchors, and
the inheritance of our posterity brought un
. der the controul of a domineering power,
r ' pillaged like Holland, devaluated like Ger
-1 many, convulsed like Genrta, destroyed like
I Venice, and bartered away to some foreign
i despot? What American, who dtfervte the
. name, can view these horrors with indiffer
ence? But when these enormities are brought
home to ourselves by wanton and barbarous
t depredations on our unoffending niÂ«rÂ»:hants,
r when our vefftls failing even under the fanc
. tiwn of a treaty are plundered by orders of
r this haughty government, our seamen con
demned to undergo the mod painful and hu
, miliating punishments while peacefully prose
, cuting their lawful business; with what in
e donation should every bosom glow, thu: has
been ever warmed by the fire of patriotism ?
s How any citiieu of America can feel with
calmness, much more apologize for such in
' fults, is to me a mystery that no analyfisof
human nature can unravel. If the friends
of- France, who are among us, be really
convinced, that her Power is irrefiltable. and
j that all the nations of the earth mult fall
â  prodrate before her, then indeed may they
1 argue confidently â¢' that the sooner we join
. in her triumph, tfie better we shall rare;
, " better to join with the Plunderers than
"to risque our all by refinance: How
I " have those States been treated, which
, " piefumed to oppose this mighty people
" raised up by Ptovidence to reform the
_ " world." Language like this, is daily
r among us, and men of virtue, sense and re
' ligion, forgetful of the and de-
I gradation of their own country, wish te for
| gettthe present enormities of another, in the
_ visionary hope of its becoming at a future
day the deliverer and iHdru&or of mankind:
How far France may become a scourge in
the hand of heaven to punish the wicked
ness of men, belongs not to short-sighted
mortals to determine. Like Attila, who
fliled hirnfelf the Scourge of Gad and his
desolating Hunns, (he has indeed executed
j mod awful vengeance upon herfelf and
! neighbours. Perhaps America may likewise
be doomed to groan under her plagues.
( But that this nation should be a chosen in
p drument in the hands of Providence to en
creafe the stock of human happiness and
knowledge, is a supposition not bottomed
} upon any probable foundation. Light in
s deed may fonoet.imes rife out of darkness, or
| der from confufion. But what political or
religious improvements can be expe&ed from
a nation, which for the lad ten years has
been rioting in blood and rapine at home,
carying confufion and anarchy among its
. neighbours; which has set at nought the
facied obligations of solemn treaties, torn
up the very foundations of Chridianity, and
discarded the belief of God and his Provi
dence. â  Let the friends of this people in A
merica think seriously of these things, and
then pronounceon thereafonablenefs of their
attachment, I trust, upen cool reflec
tion, prejudices of this kind, will retreat
before theraysof enlightened patriotifm,and
that the time is not far didant, when the
citizens of this country will bury all predi
leiSlion for foreign nations in a love for their
own, and maintain that Independence of feu
timent, without which political Indepen
dence will be of short duration.

AT a junfture when the question of
a Commercial Treaty witl Fraace maj soon
become an ohjeA of difcuiUon, a work oi this kind
becomes extremely ulelul to those aitizens Â»f the
United States, who may be defirons to enable thenv
feWes to view this fubjefi, under its various at
petfls ; and they will have the fatisfadion to he
furmfhed with the neceJTary data, to judge of the
ufclulcefs Â«f this tranfaAioo.
Ihis work is principally diftinguilhed by the
nehnefs of the otferva' ions, the ptrfpieuity of the
aiyl the modesty of the theory which it
contains. >t Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer'ebarn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeiul produce. It is addrcf
fed to the unfortunate La FaraTTt, in letters,
which fugitive fo r m, the author who could only
devote a few wotka to this occupation, was ..bliged
to adopt. Although â¢ircumftancis are in many
refpcAs different at the present day, from what
they were in' the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny '.ibfolute and permanent data ftiU remain, that
the jiUiciom reader will not appreciate the work
left on that account; on the contrary, M many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
sult of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince him that in all tranfa&ions, between free
nations, every thing may be eapeSed from the ef
forts of truth and juftiaf.

Undun tidâ  Ihe author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furniflied fn>m France or
Eoglar.dâlt is principally on this ful>jeÂ£t (which
would havcaltonifhed a mere theoriO) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kin . ot taUeaut, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be desired, are the only sure guides
the statesman can take for th policy of treaties de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We oncot too much admire the apparent ex
aftnefs of colonel Swau't calculations ; and although
the prophesies of Lord Nuffield have already been
coniradified by experience, and by feversi able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of the present work,
dispute w"h him the only ground on which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the required condition, will be better able
than Creat Britain to supply us with fevoral articles,
which the Englifli authoi allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's pettishly tiffed en (if he
has any) docs nÂ«t appear to at any time created
a partiality of judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in <789, that is to lay, at a period when arts
and manufactures did not present in France the vast
means and probabi'ity of exteufion which they now
poifrfs- that even in 1789. it was prelumable, that
Fiance would not only have the means to supply one
half of am given quantity of the prudu&ions of Frame
end upland unites, butslfoto enter into competition
with Great Britain for tne remainder, in proportion
to the wisdom of her government, and the industry
of her inhabitants.
