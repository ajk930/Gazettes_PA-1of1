Continuation as the delate on the address in atifwer
to the President's speech. â 
Mr. W. Smith observed that the supporters of the
present motion expreflcd their willingness to compli
ment the President, but seemed to with to take away
all the materials for doing so. They will not allow
h mto be complimented upon the prosperity of the
country, or upon its free and enlightened state, or up
on his wifdoni and patriotism, ( Mr. Giles laid he
had never denied the patriotism cf the Preiident ; he
believed him to be an honest aiVl patriotic man, but
denied the firmneis and wifdomof liis administration)
Mr. Smith, said the preftnt motion went to rtrike out
what related to the wisdom and patriotism of the Pre
sident's administration, but he was at a loss to dis
cover the difference between the wisdom and patrio
tism of thePreiidentindlh.it of his administration;
nor did he fee what gentlemen could fubftitvteas com
plimentary to the President in place of what was pro
posed to be struck out. The firit paragraph, he said
related to onr internal tranquility which was compar
ed to the state ot several of the European nations in
yolved in war. And why, he asked, 'should a foreign
nation be offended with us for Ipeaking of war ? It
ought hot to offend them, becaufewe rejoice that we
are at peace, and to appreciate the high value of such a
state it. was necessary to contrail it with the tniferies of
war. Had not, foreign nations, he rfced, held up this
country aa an example of wisdom in avoiding war ?
They had done so , and yetthis country was not in re
turn to refer to them. âWith refpeil to the wisdom
and fortitude of the PrefideAt he wished gentlemen
would point out er.e (ingle aft, where those qualities
were wanting. It had been asserted that the adniinif
tration of the President had not been wife and firm as
it refjÂ»eÂ£ted our foreign relations ; but let it be remem
bered that the principal ground of complaint of the
French minister related to the conduit of Congreft and
not to the executive, and to afls of the executive func
tioned by Congress. llow then can gentlemen cast
the whole blame upon him, Therewas no a<St of the
President which had been offenfrve to the French na
tion, which had not been fandtioned by Congress, If
there was any blame, therefore, it fell upon them.
Mr. Smith instanced the a<S refpedtiug prizes, procla
mation of neutrality, icc. and hoped they should hear
no more of separating the President from the other
branches of the government, or. the government -from
the people.âThe gentleman from Pennsylvania ( Mr.
Swanwick) said that Great JBritain and France tho't
themselves prosperous \ And what was the inference
he drew ? That if we call ourselves profpersus, they
will be offended by the Contrail. This could no be
the cafe ; foi* if these two nations thought themselves
prosperous, as he rcprefented them, they" would doubt
less be plcafed or laugh Â»t our folly in fuppoling them
otherwise. But he wondered how that gentleman
should have so greatly changed his opinion fincc tail
session. When'the British treaty wa# before them, he
mentioned the great increase of commerce and manu
factures which had taken place ; that they had out
grown themselves, as a boy, said he, outgrows his
cloaths : yet now gentleman will not allow the
prosperity of the country.
With refpeft to our being the freeft and most en
lightened nation in the world ; he wiftied gentle
men' would fperify the nation that was more so
He knew of none. He did not believe that any
nation enjoyed<hat civil & religiout freedom which
was the portion of the citizens of this country, or
that was so enlightened, particularly as to'what re
lated to affairs of government. If gentlemen knew
of any other nation so prosperous, he would a/k
them if they should be willing to change filiations
with such a nation ? he believed they would not.
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) objected
to regret the President's from public life,
as there were many others who would fill the office
equally well with him. But he would arte, where
was the man who had so much of the people's con
fidence as he, and who could so well iafure an o6e
dience to the laws ? He believed there had been
fituationsin his Presidency, in which.no other man
could have steered the veflei of state through the
(hoals and quickfnndt with which it wat ftirrounded.
He mentioned the western infurreilion, the
business of the French minister Genet. Was it
not, he asked, to be regretted, that such a man
was about to leave the honorable (latioahe had fill
ed ? Gentlemen seemed to think, there was too
much of adulation in the answer.âTruth, he said,
could not be considered at adulation ; aÂ»d let gen
tlemen point to any part us it, and fay, there is
no truth in this. If it wat founded in taÂ£t, it was
juflito express their gratitude to the man to whom
this country owed so much. He wished gentlemen
to advert to the rfdrefs presented to him on his
coming into office, and on hit re-election. riad he
done any thing to forfeit the refpeft then (hewn to
him ? What would be thought, he asked, if they
were to (Irike out that part of the answer now ob
jected tÂ» ? It would be {aid to be not only witlihol
ding jjraife, but exhibiting him to reprehension.â
If struck out, and fomi cold, iinmeamog words
substituted in their place, it would convey to the
world an idea, that he had involved the country in
difficulties, destroyed public and private credit,
and been the eaufe of other mifehiefs, which had
been repreferted to exifi.
When this great man wat going forever to retire
from public life, it was expefled by the nation,
that they fhonld express their love, gratitude and
affeflion towards him. These fentimentt had been
expressed by every legifjature of the United States,
which had met since his retirement was announced.
Why, then, (aid he, should we alone be lilent" ?
Why fend him into reiiremcnt with daggers in his
heart ? He could not fee any reason for reprefling
feelings which lud been so generally.expressed.
It was objected to the answer, that it wished his
example might be the guide of his fueceffor ; but
he prayed, whoever he might be, that be might
follow his steps. Upon the whole, he said, there
might be an inaccuracy of exprtflion, a redundancy
of stile, but he did not believe thete was a sentiment
liable to objeAion. He hoped, therefore, the mo
tien to strike out would not prevail.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said, that he did
not life to accept the challenge given by the gen
tleman who spoke last from Soutb-Carolina, and
to point out a nation more free and enlightened
than ourt, nor did he mean tocontcft thefaft of our's
being the freeft and most ealightsned in the work!
aa declared in the reported iJ.'rcfs, but he Â»Â«l tie
vertheleft of opinion that it did not become them
to make that declaration, and thuÂ» to extol them
ftlves by a companion with and at the expence of
nil others. Although those words were in his view
obje&ionable, he was far from assenting to the mo
tion for Unking out the seven or eight lad chafes
of the address. The queilion of order having
been decided,. Mr. Dayton said he would remind
the committee that if they wished to retain or even
to amend any feftion or sentence of all that was
proposed to be (Iruck otft, they ought to give their
negative to this motion, as the only means of ac
complishing their purpose. It was fufficienl there
fore for those who wereoppofed to the queflion for
striking out the whole, to (hew that any part within
it ought to be preserved. Not unnecessarily to
wade time by lengthening the debates, he would
take the clause firft in order, and confine his re
marks to; that alone. This part of theaddfefs had
certainly not been read of hau been misunderstood
and mifrcprefented by tire member for Pennsylva
nia. Did it, Mr. D. alked, draw a comparison,
as had been suggested by that gentleman, between
the. relatively happy ft&te of tlie country in the
present and the year immediately preceding : Did
it go further than to fay that the situation of the
United l States was more profpeious at this period,
than at that, which immediately preceded the ope
ration of the present government ; certainly it did
not ; and were proofs necelTary to fubflantiate this
faÂ£l, or arguments wanted to enforce it ? The (late
of this country nnder this government was he said
that of order and union, their situation at tbif pe
riod alluded to was a melancholy scene of disunion
and diffoltition. This happy change was alcribed
and juflly ascribed in the report to our free and ex
cellent form of government, and the interposition
of an overruling Provideucc in our national affairs,
aeither of which, he trusted, a majority of that
house would be prepared to deny or dispute. . He
could not discern the least possibility of giving of
fence to other nations in contrafling the blessings
derived to this country from a ftatc ef peace wi'h
the calamity in which a fl*te of war involves those
who are so unhappy as to be engaged in it. The
cxprefiinns were such as could not be construed
either to impeach, or indeed to have any allusion to
the forms of government under which they lived.
If those forms weri such as belt suited the disposi
tion and circumltances of those who
them, and were bed calculated to render them hap
py, surely it must be admitted fhat war was not
less a calamity even to those the mod favorably
ciretimftanced in that refpett, and it could <oot
therefore be confidercd a refie&ion upon them to
call it so, nor to deprecate such a (late of things,
or to contrast it with that of peace which this coun
try was so happy as to enjoy. He had hoped, he
said, that the mover upon reviewing this clause
would have excluded it from his motion ; but, as
lie did Kot think proper to do so, Mr. Dayton
could fay with great confidence that a majority of
the honfe could not be faund to rife for ttriking
out a proposition which embraced the acknowledg
mant of a (late of good government as preferable
to disunion and anarchy, and a (late of peace as pre
ferable to that of war, and contained expreflions
of gratitude to Providence for an overruling care,
fignaHjr manifefted in our affairs.
Mr. Ames said, if any gentleman intended to
vote for the present motion, to strike out the whole
from an idea of adopting the amendment proposed
by the gentleman from S. Carolina, (Mr. Harper)
who offered a substitute, he would observe to them,
that he wished that influence to be done away, as
those who would strike out the whole, wanted no
fultirure. The two motions were opposite, and
the friends of the one ought to refill the other.
The gentleman who made the motion, had not done
so from any objetf ion he himfelf had to the origi
nal, but in order to accommodate dheia, It was
well known, that a committee as five members, of
very opposite politics to one another, had been ap
pointed to prepare a refpeftful address in answer to
the President's speech (here Mr. Amesrtad their
inltru&ions). As it was the duty of-the commit
tee to prepare a refpe&ful address, it might be
â¢matterof disapprobation, but not of fmprife, that
they had taken notice of the several fnhjefts touch
ed upon in the President's speech. It will not be
improper to notice, said he, that there was some
difference of opinion in the committee, with refpeft
to the woiding of that part ot the answer now
moved to be ftvnck out ; but from a convi&ion of
the delicacy of the fubjeft, and a desire to prtferve
inviolate that decorum which, he was sorry to re
mark, this debate had broken, such an accommo
dation took place, as met the approbation of every
member. They had therefore some reason ty hope,
while they regarded every membai's right to think
for himfelf, that it would have met with the ap
probation ot both fides of the honfe. For this rea
foa, except the sentiments should be found objec
tionable, he should wifli the address to be kept en
lire, rather than that the fubllitute proposed should
be introduced into it, as that would not have the
advantage of the fame agreement of the commit
tee, not could i. be fÂ« maturely considered as the
teport which was before them ip print. He was
not disposed to go mto the detail of this discussion
From the unanimity of the committee, he mi"ht
indeed truly fay he did not expe&, and was unpre
paired for it, although he. thought he might depend
upon no other refour:es than the spontaneous emo
tions of the moment would supply, when he heard
gentlemen doubt the truth of the firft paragraph in
qnfftion. Still he#iofe rather to look for its defence
upon the general impreftion of obvious truth, than
to exhanfl himfelf by exhibiting it in detail. He
would refer to fads. If there was one voice in
America an any fubjeft, it was a confidence in the
constitution, and that the country had been exemp
ted from war, by the patriotism and wisdom of the
President. These were not sentiments they were
called upun to prove by vOHching documents and
faÂ£h : it wa* the fixed imprrffion that faSs had
left on the mind, on which be chose to rely. He
appealed for the truth of them to every heart, (-ex
cept that of # the gentleman from Virginia) who
did not tegret the retirement of the President. He
believed hit appeal would not be in rtin. But was
there a propriety in making such a dfclaration ?
He iv >uH briefly hqtn're info the nature of t!re se
veral obje&ions to the draft of the addreis. It had
been said, that it was neither natural nor becoming
to make comparisons between this country and Eu
ropeâbetween the present government, and the tu.
multuous system which exiited prior to its inftitu.
tion. He appealed tÂ» the fen(e and propriety of
every oni, whether thiÂ» doctrine was hot Angular
as well a 9 extravagant ?
Was any thing more natural, than tW a man
in profpeaous cireumflances should increase hit hap.
pinefs by comparing his situation with those in a
less favorable (late ? The man who did not this,
left one half of the harvest of his happiness un
reaped. By this comparison, a spirit of thankful
nef9 was txci'ed towards the beneficent power who
beftowtd these bleflings. Some gentlemen may,
though it would be ItraÃge, think differently on
this occalion, but he thought the sentiment both
natural and becoming. If even a man whnfe life
has not been greatly distinguished by hfs enjoy
ments, fees the fuffe-ings or the fliipwreck of others,
will it not be his duly habitually to thank Gad far
his blessings? But if he has been a fufferer
if he himielf has escaped fliipwreck or fire, will he
ftifle more refine'd sensations of grati*ude for the
advantages he does enjoy ? Or, if a man's neighbor
fuffer from fire, will he not feel thankful, that he
has escaped the calamity ? He cannot be thankful
enough for what he enjoys without adverting to the
calamities he has escaped. Nor di<s he conceive any
mote imprepriety in thus introducing gratitude,
than the introduction of it by clergymen into their
daily prayers.
But it had been fa?J, to contrail our country,
with others in a state of war, is difrefpeftful. If
that be really an objection, it might be easily ob
viated by adding " unhappily" after the word
" war." It would certainly be improper to exult
over the misfortunes of others; and the word un
happily would express that we deplore them ; but
when calamities did $xift, it was not improper to
rejoice that they were not our own. ' - â 
A gentleman had taken occasion toobferve, that
the cty of foreign influence had been founded thro'
the country. He should not be rudely explicit as
to the foundation there was for this cry ; butVhen'
it was once raised, the people would attend ta'fafts.
The world would judge between those who wished
to support the government and others. Mr. Ames
alluded to the factious spirit which foreign agent*
endeavored to flir up amongst the people of this
country. England he said had been outraged fyy
an appeal from government to the people, and par
liament addressed the king to fend an imperial en
voy out of their country, for interference with
their internal concerns; and yet a similar ipftance
had occurred, and met with no reprobation A
remarkable fact, and more of the fame kind ap
pear. We are at peace. But we mutt not call
ourfclves a free and enlightened people, left it
should be construed that other nations are not so.
This over-eau:ioufnefs, said he, may be the way to
aflert Ataierican dignity, but he did nol think so.
Foreign influence exitts, and is dilgraceful and
pernicious, when we dare not commend our c&nfti
tution, nor even thank God for its success in our
prayers* He did not think the French nation had
any reason to complain against this country. There
was not only no reason, they wanted even the co
lor of a pretext.
Mr. Ames referred to the words of the Prefi
detjt in his speech : â¢' Standing for the iaft time,"
See. He congratulated us that tfie experiment of
the form of government had so well fuweded. The
committee, he said. were charged to return a rÂ«-
fpeftful address. The paragftph objected toy was
an appeal to facts. Whether the experiment had
been unfuecefsful or not, was to be determined.
He should think it had indeed failed, if he enter
tained all the opinions of gentlemen whÂ» had advo
cated this motion to ftrikc outâwho denied the
prosperity of the countryâreprobated its neutral
systemâthought our principles tending to despot
ismâand the executive m?giftrate wanting in wif.
dom and firmnefsâthat their miferiea originated in
banks and funding corruption. He should think a
republican constitution a chimera in its nature, and
a curfc in practice. But he entertained no opinion
of this kind. He believed this constitution had suc
ceeded remarkably well. If this was true, would
I it not be also ufeful to make the
! ever foreign nations might do? (for he did not
| much regard what they did.) And if the period
was come, that our government was brought into
'a peculiar Situation; if, in plain Eiighfh, we are
brought (as Mr. Giles alledges) to the eve -of a wsr
France, there was never a time when it was
more our duty, boldly and loudly to declare, wt
arc ready to meet them, to cling to our government,
and the more so, as it is villified by thejr agent,
and to-tay, 'we mean to support it against foreign
power asd foreign tnfults. This was was the time
to support our dignity with moderationânet to fay
that we defy you, but that we are Americans, and
neither-FreÃch nor Englifa, This was the time, if
the facts stated by the |gentleman from Virginia
(Mr. Giles) werefoanded, to (how our unanimity,
and not an appearance of imbecility and difeord.
Another thing occurred to him. It had been
said, that the Prefidcnt no doubt was an hoaeft
man and a patriot, but it was not believed he was a
wife man. "The gentleman frop Virginia confuJer
td his administration as neither wife nor'firm, but
his integrity as a private man he had no objection
agatnlt. If the committee were to make an ad
dress after this manner, the house has nothing to
fay with refpeft to your admmifl.ation ; except
that it is not firm, nor wife, and some of us iniitt
dilhoneft and treacherous, though we allow you
have had no hand in the iniquity, still we believe
you a wife and peaceful man, and /hould be glad to
addiefs yen as such. In one word, fjr, we are glad
you are going to live snugly in this an
address of refpeft or insult ? Was this the refpeft
to be /hewn to the firft man in the nation in the
world i There was not a word in tUe address which
did not accord with his fentimer.ts. He did not
believe with the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr. â¢
Smith) the Piefideut *oulj carry with him to
retirement daggers in his heart, if that house refu.
fed to do him justice. He bears in his bread that
confcioufqefs of refthude, that armour which'r erÂ« could nÂ«t pierce. The hlgliell terms of res
p?ift which could be ufcd, they owed to the Pre
sent of the Unite! States. 'This, it might be
laid, was leading- to adulation, but it was neverthe
left true, whereas the efieace of flattery- is falfe
hood and deception. Let gentlemen deny it. Let
â them fay that the country does not entertain these
featiments. The yeas and uays, he said, would
undoubtedly be taken, when the real friends of the
President would be known. (Mr. Giles had said
he rejoiced to fee the gentleman determined to go to
his feat in Virginia, and did not regret his religna
tion. His name will appear to that opinion. It
was not present impreflions of the President's con
dud, out the whole of his life which (lamped his
chÂ»rafter. His country, the admiring World, and
faithful Hirtory, were now the keepers of his fame
and rvould keep it inviolate. We might refufe our
fuffrages, and thereby separate ourselves from the
general sentiment of mankind. We miy be lingu
lar ; he will be illustrious. ~ If, said Mr. Ames in
we address the President at all, it should
be in a refpe&ful manner, for lo;h tefpeft is.infnlt
in disguise. He hoped, therefore the motion beÂ«
fore them would be disagreed to, atÂ»d that the eri
giaal address would be adopted
to be continued.]]

The Comedy of the Child of Nature, performed on

Mr. Cooper played Albei to with much propriety

he being, aswe are informed, but 21 yeafs of age. This
young mail, whole privatechara&er weubderliand to be

perforner, but the acremonious and cruel attacks
which have been made upon him in some of the pa

malice than either of justice or candour, seem to have
deprefled his spirits, and abated a little of his ardour,
but he need not be alarmed, while he trulls himfelf to
the protection of this geherous public, he has nothing
to fear from malignant or designing men who, what
ever be their motives, may attempt to undermine or

_______ DRAMATICUS.
F.r the Gazette or rm United Statis.
Mr. Fenno,
It hat been said often that Frenchmen have rob
bed and mafiaered with better excuses than Ame
ricauscan plead forjuflifying them as they do, with
out the like temptations and in cold blood. I saw
with approbation a paragraph in your paper con
demning the plunder of pictures and other -outrages
in Italy. A reply in the Aurora (hews a fouler
spirit than even piÂ£lurÂ« Healing., A jult censure
on the outrages of a conqueror is termed abuse in
the Aurora which is devoted to calumny on our (
own government. Excellent decency thai owes no
thing-at home.
The writer of the reply infills that the world will
be benefited by the use the French will make of
their colledion. Is this an apology ? It was the
creed of the Jesuits that the end will fanftify the
means. Surely Mr. Bache'9 correspondent has not
turned Jesuit ? To levy contributions in money was
ever considered one ef the rigid rights of warâ
But to war againd the arts and sciences was reserved
fer the iafamy of the modern Vandal philosophers.
To spare from pillage, Libraries, Pictures, Col
leges and Altars was ever deemed a law of war.
Conquerors prided themselves in afcrupulous obfer
â vation of it. What a suss their toad eaters In this
country made because tTiey had charged their naval
officers to forbear molesting some navigator or dif
eoverer, whose name I forget. Yet by the bye our
quakers and abolition focietics should remember
tiiat the French ships destroyed the benevolent Sj
erra Leone Settlement which the Euglifo had form
ed in Africa.
One might expect the French would rob chur
ches, because their antichriftian calendar, their ap
plause of atheists in their conventions, the perfec
tions and murder of priests, &c. &c. have given
the world fair warning. But their endless declama
tion about the arts and sciences, would lead one to
hope some protection for their maftcr-pieces, where
ver their conquering arms might seize them. Alas !
this is frail rated ! and Americans are found base
enough to jullify it, nay, pretend it is the lore of
the arts and sciences that makes prize of the pic
tures, statues and booksof Italy. Are these "fair
daughters of the ikies'' to be woo'd only by ravilh- <
iÂ»g them ? Only sword in hand, and amidst the
smoke of burning towns ? Delicate lovers, who j
will not be refufed ! ,
Plainly and seriously, is any man blind to the (
tendency of making plunder or these rarities to de
grade the arts and to barbarife men worse than for
nserlyâfor these very things escaped deftrudtion by 1
the old Goths and Varidals.
The feeble nations must renounce a property now '
no longer spared by conquerors, as a neighbor na- f
tion might befeizej) with a piaure rags, aTid begin ,
or pursue a war merely to peur the colle&iens ef
half a dozen nations and half a hundred cities into 1
the mufesm of Paris. Ridiculous as this passion <
is, we find the French avow it, and our vandals '
applaud it. Naples, Florence, Parma, Modena,
Turin and Rome, will in future dread to have ma- j .
nufcripts, pifturcs and statues that will draw upon j
them malfacrÂ», plunder, snd what iÂ» worse, igno- 1
wmy. The trephies of their abafetnerit sre to be
- proudly displayed in the m life urn of Pans. A-id
: this toe by the gentry'that proclaim fraternity to
â¢ the whole world. To pursue the idea before dated,
- where will p.ftures hang fafely except in Gibral
- tir. Uther European towers are more or less lia
: Die to be taken.
I In vain is it said, the mnfetim will exhibit in a
: groupe the united glory of the aits. Suhjeaing
I them to military outrage will degrade them dill
> more. Princes, no matter from vanity 01 other
motives, have been proud,of-Mm",jg them by
their munificence. In future, they will be cau
ttous. Not will the French ca(h supply what will
1 be withdrawn by other nations. For while every
war may collell (mind the Aurora phrase) rare
works of art, fifty waggon loads at a time, who
will recotnrr.etid paying lor them.
In one word, the poffl-ffiun of these things will
be in future precarious, if not dangerous : the taste
for them will decline, when ihcy are outraged, ex
hibited in waggons, broken, (tamed and bloddy,
through five hundred miles of country. The rage
of war is thus embittered, by falling on rarities,
which wete the pride of a nation, and are now wet
or rotten in tents, or gone to drew the fides of the
Alps with^their fragments, or to ionmortalife in
France, the humble Hate of iheir farmer owners. |
The pica that pictures were taken as a ransom
for the territory, is pretty enough, an'l well becom
ing the Aurora. Have not the neutral states yield
ed pidtures by fear, as well as enemies by force
The conquering French faints, it fcems, have a
right to inherit the earth : and because they forbear
to take pofleflion of their inheritance, they have a
right to every thing betides. Implacable :nemies,
fays the AuroraâAnd were not the French their
enemies also ? The right of the conqueror goes
far, it is allowed : but it has bounds. This use of
the right, is a horrid abuse, and an injury to man
kind, as tfell as the arts. The feelings of mankind
will go with the conqueror, when he exposes
his enemy to the extreme ot either misery or in-j
dignity ; and accordingly, the currency of French
principles will be opposed by the remembrance of
French exactions. It is tmpoffible to Urip a coun
try, arid profclyte it at the fame time -.-Miad that,
Mr. B.iche.
if the contagion of rapacious anarchy should
ihus (top itfelf, the lovers of tranquility and the
arts will fayâAmen. .
New-Jersey, Dec. 13, 1796.
N. B. If the word irata/ loldiers so ofFenfive to
the writer in the Aurora and the diead of mafTacre
suggested in this paragraph should seem too harsh,
let him read the proclamation of the French gene
lal Angeieau at Verona. He threatens to burn
whole towns and kill evjry fcml if one Frenchman
is killed. Gracious heaven, if a drop of enemy's
blood is Ihed by the people , who fight for their

It appears from entries at the Collector's Office for
this port, made in pursuance of the a<ft of Congress of
ihe last session, that in the quarter commencing on the
ft of July, and ending on the 30th of September laft,t
*90 seamen have been registered ; and that during the
fame, period, 22 seamen were impressed, of which 4
were natives, 9 whose citizenship was unknown or un
certain, 2 Swedes, 1 Dutchman, 3 Irishmen, and 3
foreigners, whose country is unknown, but in place of
whom 2 Americans were returned by the veflel which
impeded them. But one of these impreflments was
made in Europe j and one also from a veflel returning

The Legislature of New-Hampshire met at Concord,
the 13d ef November. Governor Gilraan addrefftd
them in a very full and elegant Speech ; in the tourfe
of which he observed, that " The a<st of dignating a
man to preside at the head of our national government,
must always be deemed highly important. Hitherto '
the voice ot our country in this choice has been as one. 1
But the illuirious patriot whose wisdom, prudence and
fortitude have been so eminent in conducing the af
fairs of our nation, has mad# known to the public his
determination to retire, at the expiration of the time
for which he has been eleited. The eflemblage of
virtue and talents which he pofTefTes,have been exhi
bited in a manner exalting to hitman nature. May the
sentiments contained in his late address to the people, '
be deeply engraved on all hcaits,; and may the great
rulcf of nations continue to guide the public fufFrages
and deliberations." *
To which the Ijegiflature repliedâ" We heartily
concur in ientiment with your Excellency, on the im
portance of feleiling from the people, a man to preside
at the head of our government j the unanimity in this
trjniaiftion hitherto, has been no less remarkable than
the virtues of the man who has been the objeil of our
choice. May every inflruiHion he has given whether
by example or precept, make an indelible impression
on every heart, and a remembrance of the unrivalled
services he has rendered, iafpire with gratitude to
heaven that he has bv-eti lo long continued the gleryof
his country; and whje we regret the neeeility of
turning our attention from him, in the choice ofa chief
magistrate, our hearts follow him to to thefcenes of do
mestic retirement with the mod fervent wishes for his
present and future happinef*.
ALARMING!
Lafl evening between 8 and 9 o'clock a fire was
discovered in a bark framed building of Mr. Cres
ses in Maiket street, between 6t"h anc! 7th dreets.
Frytn eveiy circumdance it is indubitable that this
fire was kindled by some incendiary with a design
to spread a conflagration. A small quantity of
draw was plased under two pieces of bo&rd, the
fides of a wheel barrowâthe draw was set on fire
by a coal, and when discovered was in a blaze, the
boards were much burnt.
.1 he fire it appears was brought in two pieces of
leather which were found near the spot. A timely
discovery prevented in all probability much mif
ehief.
COMMUNICATIONS.
It seems as if those acknowledged trtlths, or axi
oms, which guide men in other sciences, jniflead
our democrats in their politics. The pronenefs of
liberty to licentiousness no one deniesâand the ter
mination of licentiousness in despotism, is no less
agreeable to fact and found theory. Vet the de
mocrats fay, and fsy to a man, tbe Frcnch are in a
revolutionary date, their excelles and woi fe were to
be exprttedâthat is impofiole, but they willeda
blilh libei ty. Now pray what right has a friend of
anarchy to affirm that liberty will come next. Af
ter licentiousness comes what ? Despotism. Liber
ty is the daughter of honelt parents, not of vice
and violence.
1 his inference is plain, .those who look for the
loss of liberty a 9 the probable consequence of con
fufion ate wiser, fafer, and more watchful keepeis
Â«f it, than those who can believe that licenciouf
nefs only brings more liberty ; even such o%>m de
mocrats as are houeft, as fume of those who pin
their faith on the sleeves of wicked leaders, may be,
are dangerous in their principles, and unfit to be
intruded with federal authority. They cenfureTear
and hate our -conditution, or, as they will acknow
ledge, several very important parts of it, and almost
all it's admiilidration : its entire overthrow so far
from dangerous, much less fatal, is only a new Ihuf
flinÂ£ of the pack of clrds, a new chance for the
people to chtife a form of government, more pure,
tree and amijble.
This iilca is chirafterifticof the party, BDd it Ts
nor unfair, nor exaggerated in the lead, for'thofe
now charged with it, maintain witk-the ze Â»l of fee
taries that fs<ft and experiment, no one can fay how
many times repeated in France, have proved nay,
more have made it an article of the political gospel,
that revolution and liberty are fynonimous terms
The quelfioti ia seriously repeated, are such men
proper .to be chosen to office, at any time, when
their ele&ors do not wifli for a revolution.

Contrail the boaded prosperity, blasphemy in
contempt of truth 1 so loudly and daringly vocife
rated by the Executive of the United States, and
reverberated by Congress ; by the Executives of
the dates and re-echoed by their legiflaturcs, with
existing truths glaring as a fumtner's fun, with the
loudly crying facts. Our commerce and navigation
prostrate at the feet of British despotism. Our sea
men in chains or under arms against the advocates
of the rights of man, their muscles contorted *nd
finking under the British lash, our merchant* rob
bed of their merchandizeâcrushing in ruin every
sea port town in the union ; and in their ruin in
volving thotifands of their unfufpefting fellow-citi
xens 1 This is prosperity with a witnefi. Our ap
parent prosperity alas! ha 9 been the refalt of our
fictitious credit of funding and banking fjftems, and
withal rifiÃg out of the miseries, the imperious ne
ceflities and wants of a filler republic, who raised
America into existence among tjje nations of the
earth struggling for freedom with the combined des
pots of Europe. Is this the prosperity of which
Americans should extiltingly bos It ? Gad forbid.
And this appaient prosperity is impudently ascribed
too, to the 6 years glorious Washington adminif

Bituat*d within one quarter of & mile from the Brandywine
Mills, and half a mile from the borough Â©f Wilmington.
THE dwelling house is built of (lone, two stories high,
genteely firufhed, and contains four hanctfbtne rooms on
a floor, besides an"entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellars. It is genera fly thought to command the mofta
giceable profneft of the Delaware, from the source of that
livei to the Capes* This project ia greatly embeliifhed by
a full view of a vast body ot meadow, through which the,
Christiana and Brandywine creeks are seen winding in beau
tiful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a spacious
stone flable and hay loft a barn, a carrtagb house, mrfic
hoiafe, See. and a well of as pure water as any on the conti
nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of lai*d, a
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
the very best kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear
jngj There ts, moreover, on the place, a young, apple
orchard begining to bear, and leveral old trees that produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm confiib of near sixty acres of land,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes,
twenty ot which arenow in excellent clover and timothy,
and ten more will be ready for (owing next spring. A ne
fidence ot nearly 8 years has convinced the fubicriber that
the situation is remarkably healthy. The great post toad
-from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy
yards of the house. Jn a word, the beauties and conveni
ence of this fituauon cannot be enumerated in an advertile-
Snent, and when examined, will probably command the at
tention of any person who isdefirniis of living at one of the
inoft elegant country feats on the continent. The purcbafer
may enter on the premifcs next spring, or perhaps, this fall,
if application be immediately made to DÂ«fto. NICHOLAS
WAY, ia Philadelphia, to Do&or WHARTON, on the
