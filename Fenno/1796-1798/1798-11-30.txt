to be no offence previous to this ft atU!c u '
lawfully to combine of conspire with intent
to prevent, oppose, or impede the opera
Hons of the general government, nÂ»r is i t
pretended to be no offence to defame by

' ! c,al proctfsof the several Hates, and are not
â¢permitted by the constitution to be cogniz
n,S: able in the courts of the United States, fa
this the constitution of the Urrftea States is'

the power to pass all laws nectffary and prc
per to carry into execution any of the pow

of. Ly the -3d ftdiion of the iccond article,
it is enjoined on the President, in whom

constitution of the United States. As the "
former are fubjeft to the judicial power of
theJtate and are not coÂ«nlzshL- in
of the United States, so the latter are fub
jed to the judicial power of the U. States,
becapfrtkde are cases at law a tiling under
the constitution of the United States, and
without it they never could have exiled.
But for the constitution there would
have been neither a president to libel or op.
pole } and therefore, it there were any cases
at law, to which the judicial power of the
United States did extend when the consti
tution was made, and before ai.y laws were
made, these may be inferred to be of that
kin<J. The terms of the article fubm.'t to
the judicial power of the United States
" allcafea in law and equity arising under
" this constitution, the laws of th<; United
" States and treaties" which are three dif
tinÂ£i fotirces of jurifdi&ion ; consequently,
t'ere must be fonae cases contemplated by
the conPitution, within the judicial power,
independent of particular iiws or treaties :
If there be any such ca'es, furelr unlawful
confpiraeies to stop the government, and
unlawful defama ory libels againll it,againft
congress, and against the president may be
-dee ned of this nature. It Â£fo ejltntial-W- -
regular so iety to rcitrain and prevent of_ <
fences of this kind, that in all ages an 4 all
countries, and under all forms of govern
ment, they are forbidden and punished.
There is ewery where either a written or un
written law. for punishing the circulation of
fdlfe and malicious writings the rria
g.llracy of the country, and for panjfhing
unlawful confpiraeies against..the govern- .
ment. âThis law has put no rcftraint on
truth, but endeavors ttÂ« /npprefs wicked
falfeboods, and by fo, to maintain a
decent refpett for the supreme magistracy.
In free countries it is not by force and fear,
but by.an habitual refpedl to truth and de
cency, relative to the officers chosen by the
people, and entruiled with the power* of
the government, that they can be support
ed, and the general felicity promoted.
Without a law written or unwritten of this
kind can it be expected that our present go
vernment will be durable ? If, with impu
nity, the iegia.rti<re and executive may b<--
made the objsdts of contempt and hatred a->
mong the people by means of malicious and
falfe stories, calculated to excite commoti,
ons and refinance to the measures of govern
ment, it is not certain that the conftitutioo
will be undermined and fubvertid. Its ba
sis is tire affeilion and refpeft of the people;
take these away, and the government is at
an end. Obedience to the laws is the life of
a-republic-âJf the president is not protest
ed in the. execution of the laws from the
(landers and confpiraeies of the wicked part
of society. If refpedl, veneration, aod re
verence towards cohgrefs and the president,
be not cultivated, can it bc expc&ed that
the laws will he I'uly carried into execution?
wiil not the powers veiled in the general
government fail in their effect, unless the
execution of them is aided by the prohibiti
on and puni&ment of an:awful confpiraeies?
Before what tribunals is it mod reafan-ible that rhefe ofFenees ftiou'd b: trieu . :
Are any courtt milrfc worthy b' heing eÂ»- j
trusted with the power of vindicating | t -
ionur, aud prefer viag i'w dignity of the
U.V of -.he United States, than the court- t
the United States ? In this point of view
then, it apnears that the sedition law has
ncn violated the conftitutidil by
thole offences cognizable in. the federal
courts, arid moreover that the law was pro
per for carrying into execution generally and
perhaps universally the veiled in the F
general government. Without such an in- I
terpretitiou of the conltitution, as has been
inade by me. it is plÂ«Â« that the general (
government cannot Hand alone, but must
depend entirely on the pleifure of the state f
judiciaries. Such was not, is not and ought

on the Goad of Alexandria, that admiral tl
Nelson attacked our fleet. Many o>f our si
' veflels lay at anchor. Never were exhibited p;
on either fide more extraordinary valour arid ce
obftiiiacy. The atlion was fought almost ar
ir the very port. w
We'fear that a part of the veffeli of the b;
convoy have been a!fo loft. But at any rate ! w
the troops h id beeu debarked. ( tf:
The vic--admiral Bruyeis, Cafabiailca, I h
Duchilleau, and many other capiairs of, ol
ihips of the line, are killed. pi
j The admiral's ship, which was burnt
during the a&ion, was called L'Orient, Snd
had carried Buonaparte to Egypt. She : bi
was of 110 guns. jj,
These fad new, came by the route of Con- pi
ftantinople. They are in part compensated is
for by our triumphs in Egypt, and by the pi
' conquest of a great extent ot* territory in a)
, that country. I t |
' Although there is nothing to discredit .
the new* of the misfortune, which the firet j
of admiral Bruveis has experienced, wc are h
' alTured that the dispatches of the rear-ad- ;p :
miral Villeneuve have not yet arrived ; that tl
' that officer is himfelf at Malta, with his tl
va'Jftau and one frigate ; that another vaif- 'â¢
feau ((hp of the line) has flipped into
Corfu. | b
It would seem that it was a part only of o:
our fleet which bore a (lure in this combat, 1 t<
and every body knows how unfavorable h
such an engagement iÂ» on an anchorage- h
There is room to hope that our loss will ! d

0 verted into weakness. For 011 goitig to fra
ternize with hit poffeflioni, and to cut them
up into nice little Departments, they found
j | themselves very incontinently cut up.
Frenchmen, fleeing from the avenging !
sword of England, found the fcymeter* of |
the Turks on (horc thirsting for their blood.
Turkey was her best ally. Where's now
the brutal boaster Barras ?
Jacobins have long (lood before the warld
e confelTed knaves; every day's experience
prove* them to be also fools. Those spirit
ed measures of Mr. Adams's administration,
( f which have saved America, thty said would
ruin our commerce, and fill the country
e with poverty and <iift efi. Past events have
_ daily falfified their prediftioÃs, and the fit
uatioa in which we find ourfelvcs to profit
rÂ» by the glorious event in St. Domingo,
crowns the confumniate wisdom of those
measures with consummate success.
The important event which has just taken
g place in St. Domingo, (fee oiir paper of
d yesterday) iÂ» the most interfiling and gio
-1 rious in its afpeÂ£t on the affairs of this
country, that ha* occurred since our exrft
ence as a nation. From good information,
d we learn, that the nature of the bufincfs is
) such, that the island is (o be declared inde
aÂ°! pendent, tinder the guarantee of
tain, who is to appoint a govfcnqr. arid that
it was to further these recent event* that the 1
evacuation of Port-atf-Prince, iJereWrie and I
the Mole wa* concluded on.
There can be little doubt that the leading 1
flimulus with Toufiaint, in tKS bufiuefs, '
was, to open a communication Ame- 1
rica. But even waving the cÂ»nfid;rÂ«iWof
this point, the security t(iis resolution will
afford to our valuable commerce with Ja- 1
maica, Btc. is of importance to the
Mercantile iflterefts of America. But it is
not to be supposed, that the American go
vernment will be backward in .g
---al ing the independeoce of St Domingo ; for
le however we may incline to avoid, dabbling
ld in revolutionary matters, this i* a cafe in
which r.ur inniell it so deeply involved,
_ that confidtrationrs oujjht to be
e dilregarded. The objedliin, that this step
miglit ii vâl*e us in war with the mother ty
rant, it is to be hoped will soon be done a -
way by a declaration of war. It be
/ /
worth n' i!. - , howevr. to bedew some cou-

a-d other friends lo the Rights of Negro

The moonfkine tyrants of France, have j
bee oflate so battered on all hands by the
avenging arm of Oid England. that it be- [
cocie difficult f>>r them to fcleft a single ia- j
device 'if their own prowefi with which to t
tickle the credulous ear of their multitude. *
He-:ce they have oft-n been compelled to r
dr'-fj up t!ie viftorie* of the'r enemies into ,
defeats, iwd pass them off on the deluded a
throtrg for Republican triumphs, Â«â¢
-
It wi!l be necessary for the French to
dispatch advice nf their triumphs more time-
!y in future -for in three late iuftances,
disaster has followed at their heels, before
the courier of good news had got out of j
ficrht. âThey had hardly heard of Buona
parte's landing in Egypt, before the news
came that he was surrounded by the Arabs,
â¢wd his fleet blown into the air. The veiTcl
which brought advice of the lauding their
banditti in Ireland w.is obliged to halten a
| way in order to avoid bringing them news of
J their capitulation. And the messenger of
'â  Hedouville's triumphs had hardly got out
, of fight, before the vi&or had become pau
per et exful. 5
The mailers of the French, puppet-fliow,
â  but lately m-ide use of the evacuation of \
i Jeremie, the Mole &c. to extenuate the im
pirgion of Admiral Nelson's viiinry. This
is vvhnt may be called, throwing duji ir: peo
ple's eyes. But ntÂ»w that the dull is blown
away, they may find it necessary to blind '
1 them altogether.
| The poor dupes of French demagogy,
have long been complettly muzzled. Their '
â  patience un lerthisextremity.has emboldened 1
the usurpers to pievent them from feeing the r
troth, as well as from speaking it.
Citizen Mob fcems to be looked upon

' to effett, they have only to iet him out of I
his litter, give him plenty of good feed, and Â£
hold out a profpeft of better, and he is obe- 1
' dient and faithful to their commands. If '
ihe is knocked in the head, they have only '
to tell hisfurviving companions tiiat he wilt

The Petition tf the Sul criberi, Gilizens of Â®
Philadelphia,
RefpeÃfully fheweth,
THAT the city of Philadelphia, tope- Â£
(her with many of ihe more not hern sea cc
por'.s of the United States, has been lately cc
and repeatedly visited with one of the molt Si
dreadful and deft>uÂ£iive diseases which as-
?i& mankind Its cause appears to divide d<
the opinions of Piiyficians, and its cure al- f c
molt eludes the power of medicine, âand { a
of its nature we know little but by its dread- tj<
ful effcdH. at
Whether it be imported from abroad, 01 -
originates with ourselves, we do not under- j
lake to decide.âlt is fufficient for the pur- j
â¢ pose of this application, that the air of the a ,
city, during the hot leafon, appears favorable Â£
to its progress, and that, while the cou -.try n;
â  remains free from its attack, the citizens ft
have found no fecuriiy but in flight.
After the firft visitation by this severe t ]
â¢ â  scourge, we fondly flattered ourselves, that j.
i it wa occafloned by a ce-incidence cf cir- j B
cumltances which would never again be
found in union; but this hope has proved p
vain, and it has, ia two fuccelfive seasons 'J
: , swept many thousands of ourtellow-citisens ,
to an untimely grave :âHelplefs infancy,
robust youth, and mature age, without ex- j'
\ ceutioa. are lia 1c to its deltruÂ£tive vi..l<m<ic
, We do not recite tbefe particnlara, as v
. though hitherto unknown to the Senate and !
â¢House ef of Pennfyivania,
but at introdu&ory to the request we are
about to preferâ
j The return of froft has been the feconda- '
ry cause, under Providence, of flapping the >
ravages (if this disorder for the prtfcttt; and, <
upon a due im f vement of this opportuni
ty depen t not only the piofperhy, but, <â 
probably, tht. extftence of this and the other *
large towns of tht United States. If means 1
can be adopted that will prevent a return c
of this desolating malady, commerce may a 1
gain flourilh ; but if, by fupinenefs and in- f
aiteotion, the necessary precautious are ne-
j j,le6ted, and (he fever shall become an an I
i.ual vilitant, our cities mud be abandoned,
âcommerce will defcrt our coalls, and we.' 1
the citizens of this great metropolis, lhail 1
all of us fuffer much distress, and a great I;
proportion of us be reduced to abfjlute ruin.
Looking forward, therefore, with trein
? bling solicitude to the next summer, and
' revolving in our minds what human pru n
n dcnce can devise upon this moll inureltmg
e occasion, we conceive it to be of tiaL I
import to the health of the city t > introduce v
pure and wholesome water, for drinking and 1
1- culinaiy purposes, and also currents ot wa- 1
ter along the llveets as the moll probable
e fp;ciHc againlt the malignant yellow ftver ?

K tiou of its inveteracy, il introduced from a
broad, by producing a temperature ia the 1
air unfavourable to the recipiency of conta- 1
