I When a writer at Charleston, in South
Carolina, is giving his opinion about the
yellow Fever, I think he might as well leave
â  the Philadelphiant to judge for themfelres
about its origin, nnd not cxprefs himfglf in
this mannerâ" We (fays he) are all at a
loss here, an they are in Philadelphia, for
the origin of this fever." Now this, with
refpeA to Philadelphia, is so palpable an
error, that I believe it would be just for
the Inhabitants of this city to answer in
this manner:âWe know to our sorrow
that the disorder was imported; that it
commenced this year to make it ratages in
one of the cleanliest parts of tht city,
which perhaps would have been the part
the lafl to be fufpefted, if it had not pro
ceeded from the mod evident cause, being
brought in by one or more infedted vefiels.
AVe know this, and many more particulars
refpefh'ng its importation ; and 'we have
rcafon to know the direful effefts of the
contagious nature of the mortal sickness in
its recent progress, both in and near the
borders of this metropolis.
With refpeft to the year 1793, tht in
stances of so mÂ«ch mortality were so sudden
and alarming, that the ideas of the people
were soon confufed by a contrariety of opi-
and perhaps the more so, bccaufe
such was the deftruAion araongfl those who
brought the disorder, that they lived not
long enough to give the needful informa
tion : seVeral of the mariners were speedy
viftims, aud the contagion spread with such
rapidity that it was soon too dangerous for
impartial persons to make suitable enquiry.
These are- fails that arc well remembered.
I believe the yellow fever was at much im
ported in the year 1793, as 11 *** ,n
present year, when in this latter instance,
we well know, that many of the alleys,
and mod fufpieiotn places, in the middle
and upper parts of the city, were not fub
jeft to the dire disease, except it was com
municated t>y an intercourse with infc&ed
persons.
Piwfs enough have been adduced by
other writers refpefting the latter importa
tion ; and the cafe is rtowTo plain, that to
make a doubt about the origin of the dis
order,' would be just as reasonable as to
doubt that thousands of the inhabitants de
serted the city in consequence of
the expenses have been enormous, and the
.loss of lives a truly awful fubjedt of sorrow
and lamentation.
That the extent of the calamity was not
equal to that in 1793, is a cause for thank
fulnefs ; and I am one of those who believe
that thinning the city of its inhabitants by
removing to the country, was one of the
means, uuder Providence, of the preserva
tion of a very considerable number of my
fellow citizens from the dangers of a dive
contagion.

Mr. Fenno,
It has been insinuated that Dr. Ruih de
rived the use of calomel, in the yellow fe
ver, from Dr.' Hodge and Dr. Carson ;
but that he could not have derived its use
from these gentlemen, the following consi
derations will afford the mod undeniable
proof. Dr. Ruih prescribed calomel in the
yellow fever as early as the 7th of August,
1793, as appears from his work on the fe
ver ; whereas Dr. Hedge and Dr. Carson
did not recommend that medicine till late
in the above mouth. Moreover, Dr. Rush
had been in the habit many years before,
of using calomel in private pradlice in bili
ous diseases ; -end in his lectures in the year
1792# the DoÂ£tor strongly recommended
it in the cure of these diseases, and quoted
Dr. Clarke and Dr. Balfour as his authori
ties for such a praftice. But further, the
manner in which Dr. Rush gave calomel
fliews the improbability of his having de
rived its life from Dr. Hodge and Dr. Car
son. Dr. Ruih gave it combined with jalap,
in the fame way. that he had seen it exhi
bited by Dr. Thomas Young in the military
hospitals during the late war. He also gave
it in certain stages of the disease in frnall
doses, to ifiduce a salivation. Now Dr.
Hodge and Dr. Carson gave it in large
doses, uÂ«comb;ncd with any purgative sub
stance, and only with a vifcw to excite purg
ing. It is easy to conceive how Dr. Hodge
might be Jed to suppose that be was the
author of this difeovery ; he haft just conic
from behind a counter, and probably had
not read a medical book, nor conversed on
a rhedical fubjeft, for fifteen or twenty
years. Ufeful hints in medicine have often
been taken from weak people, and even old
people. No man, I believe, is more dis
posed to acknowledge obligations to those
(b'urces of knowledge than Dr. Ruih, but
in the prefect instance the iuiinuation is
foundation.

AGE OF REASON. J
Mr. Erfkine's addvefs to the court of,
king's bench, on the trial f6r this publication
of Paihe's detestable and vulgar doCtrines in
his &ge of Reason, was one of the molt a
bleand elegant harangues in support of the
established that has to
boad The following are in it,
which we with pleasure seleCt in defence of
tjiechriftian caitfe, and in honor of its infpir
defender !
The book, he laid, appeared to him to
be as crtlel and mischievous in its eftefts, 3s
it was illegal in its principle?. The poor,
wham it affeCted to pitv, were daibb&i iri the
heart by it ; they had more need of conso
lations beyond the grave, than those who
had greater comforts to render life delight
ful. He could conceive an humble, inno
cent, and virtuous man, surrounded with
children, looking up to him for bread Which
hertiad not to givi t'aem, finking under the
lad day's labour, and unequal to the next;
yeft dill looking Hp with confidence to the
hour, when all tears (hould be wiped from the
eyes of affliction, and bearing the burthen
which he believed his Creator had laid upon
Win for good, in the mysterious difpenfa
tioris of a Providence which he adored.â
What a <change in such a mind might not
be wrought by this merciless publication ?
But it seems this was an Age of Reason,
and the time, and the person were arrived,
that were to diffipatc the errors which had
oterfpread the pad generation of ignorance !
The believers in christianity were many ;
but it belonged to the few that were wife to
correct their credulity. Belief was an aft
of reason ; and superior reason might there
fore diCtate to the weak. In running the
mind along the pious lilt of sincere and de
vout chrididns, he could not help lamenting
that Newton had not liVed to this day, to
have had his (hallownefi filled up with this
neiu flood of light ! But the subjeCt was too
awful for irony ; he would speak plainly and
direCtly :âNewton wa6 a ehriftian. New
ton, whose mind had burft,from the fetters
cad by nature upou our finite conceptions ;
NewtoH, whose science was truth, and the
foundation of whose knowledge of it, was
philofophvânot those visionary and arro
gant pre'fumptioris, which too often u
surped its name, but philolophy resting
upon the basis of mathematics, which like
figures, could not lie ; Newton, who car
ried the line and rule to the uttermost bar
riers of creation, and explored the princi
ples by which, no doubt, all created matter
was held together, and exilts. But this ex
traordinary man, in the mighty reach of his
mind, overlooked perhaps the errors, which
a minuter inteftigatioÂ» of the created things
on this earth might bave taught him of the
essence of his Creator. What (hould then
be said of the great Mr. Boyle, who looked
into the organic struCture of all matter, e
ven to the brute inanimate substance which
the foot treads on ; such a man might be
supposed to be equally Qualified with Mr.
Paine to look up through nature, to na
ture's God. But the result of all his contem
plation was the mod confirmed and devout
belief ib all, which the other holds in con
tempt, as despicable and drivelling super
stition. t
But this error might perhaps arise from
a want of due attention to the foundation of
human judgment, and the ftni&ure of that
understanding which God has given us for
the invedigation of truth. Let that ques
tion be anfwtred by Mr. Locke, who was,
to the higheit pitch of devotion and adora
tion, a ehriftian. Mr. Locke, whose office
was to deteCt. the errors of thinking, by
going up to the fountains of tho't, and 'to
direCt into the proper triCt of reasoning the
devious mind of man, by (hewing him its
whole process, from the firfl preceptions of
sense, to the last conclusions of ratiocination,
putting a rein besides upon falfe opinion, by
praÂ£tical rules for the condnCt of 4iuman
nature.
But these men were only deep thinkers,
and lived in their closets, unaccuftomcd to
the traffic of the world, and to the laws
which practically regulate mankind.
Gentlemen, in the place where we now
fit to adminilter the justice ofthi* great coun
try, above a century ago, the never to-be
forgotten Sir Matthew Hale presided, whose
faith in chriftianity,iÂ»an exalted commenta
ry upon its truth, and reason, and whose life
was a glorious example of its sweets, admin
ftering human jultice with a wisdom and
purity, drawn from the pure fountain of the
ehriftian dispensation, which has been, and
will be in all ages, a subjeCt of the highest
reverence and admiration.
But it is said by the author, that the ehrif
tian fable is but the tale of the more ancient
fuperftitiens of the world, and may be easily
detefled, by a proper understanding of the
mythologies of the heathens. Did Milton
understand those mythologies ? Was he less
versed than Mr. Paine in the superstitions of
the world ? No ; they were the subjeCt of
his immortal song thouhgh fliut out
from all recurrence to them, he poured them
forth from the ftorcs of his memory, rich
with all that men ever knew, and laid them
in their order as the illustration of that real
jrld exalted faith, the unquestionable source
of that fervid genius, which cast a fort of
(hade upon other works of manâ
He pa(Te4 the bouiMj of (laming (pace,
Where angeU tremble while they gaze,
He faw,.tiH blaflcl with exeefs of light,
His eyes were closed in endless night!
. But it was the light of the body only
that was in liim extinguished ; *' the eelef
tial light (hone inward, .and enabled him to
vindicate the ways of God to man/' The
result of his thinking was nevertheless not
the fatne as the author's. The mysterious
incarnation of our blefied saviour, which this
; work blasphemed in words so wholly unfit
â¢ for the mouth of a chriflain, or for the ears
. ' of a court of justice, that he durst not and
would not give them utterance. Milton
made the grand conclusion of the paradile
!oft, the reft from his fini(hed labtitirs, and
the ultimate hope, expectation and glory of
the worldâ
A Virgin is his Mother, '
Rut hit Sire the power of the Mod High,
He (hall afeend the Throne Hereditary,
And hound his reign with earth's wide bounds.
His glory with the Heavens, f
LORD ANSON.
PROSPERITY, wealth, and even fame
itfelf, are too often the casual' offspring of
mere chancy, and a train of incidents uni
formly lucky and fortunate ; but an exer
cised fortune, occasionally chequered, tra
versed, and clouded by the dorms of adver
sity, can educate and form the able
rpan, or the experienced mariner.
If lord Anfon, 111 his celebrated courf?,
had learned to brave the wintry season,
and bid defiance to the churlilh chiding of
the winter's \rinds, the seventh circumnavi
gation was our great marine,feminary, where
the fchool, the naval heroes of the
splendid aera from 1757 to 1763, were early
nnrfed and rocked in the cradle of adver-
Sir Charles Wager's well.concerted plan j
for the expedition in 1739, was fatally tra- j
versed and counteracted, in the equipment, !
destination, and departure of that fqwadron. I
LOrd Anfon triumphed over enemies more
formidable than the Spaniards, adverse sea
sons and unfortunate events, and feturned
home enriched, not so much by thetreafures
of tfie Manilla galleon, as by the more last
ing treafurÂ«s of marine science, the extension
of our naval influence, and the reputation of:
our flag, fuccefsful in the South Sea, aud
formidable in China. As he commenced
that war with success, so he terminated it
with glory in 1757, by the capture of the
whole French fleet, loaded with treasure, off
Cape Finifterre.
The cotempofaries of this great faijor still
remember and speak with delight of his mo
desty and moderation. He seemed desirous
i>f the solid poffeflion of merk, and not of
the echo of renown. No man, jnftly confi
dent of his own virtue, ever envied the re
putation of another. A general patron of
merit, he rendered the moll ample justice to
a native of Ireland, protected only by his
abilities ; though his own glory seemed al
most eclipsed in 1747, by fir Peter Warren,
aiding his promotion, joining in the nation
al lamentation for the premature destiny of
that hero, over whose monumental urn the
Naval Genius of Britain lhal) weep, while
his memory is embalmed by the regret, and
preserved in the grateful recolleCtion of his
country. For the great service off Cape
Finifterre, he was rewarded with a British
peerage in 1747. Lord Anfon terminated
that war with glory, and rendered it as fuc
cefsful at sea as it had been unfortunate on
the continent; while his maritime fuperin
tendance from 1756 to 1762 â3, was the
primary instrument of lord Chatham's ad
miriiftration, in the most splendid xra of the
British annals. Let it .be remembered that
we owe that success to naval fuperintend
ance. Partiality has been imputedâa pre
ference of the Anfon school, of the (hip
mates of the Centurion, since unjust and
idle prejudices bare been formed in favor of
landmen presiding in the marine department.
Bat when we recolleCt the names of Brett,
Saumarez,Keppel,Weft, Bofcawcn, Hawke
and Rodney, the nation (hares the offence
âthe loud voice of the community freely
confeffes the charge of partiality. Would
that we could look upon their like again 1
Would that we could fee such leaders, to
render England once more pre-eminent, to
extend her power as in that renowned peri
od, as far as winds could waft, or fails could
carry the triumphs of the British empireâ
At that period the desire of Cromwell was
accompliflied, to render the name of a Briton
as memorable at that of an aicient Roman ;
but it is not in the enthusiasm of our coun
trymen, or in the praise of our own history,
but in Voltaire's age of Louis the fifteenth,
in 1759, in the simple title of a chapter, that
we trtfce our fairelt eulogium.
" The English â¢victorious in the four quarters
of the Globe."
The riciffitudes of dates, like the ebbing
and flowing of the fmrounding ocean, are
perhaps prescribed by the wife decrees of
the, great Ruler, impenetrable to human
fagocity ; secondary causes oftfn contribute,
however, to their decline. The eJamina-,
tion of these reasons may rouse men from
a state of palsied torpor, of national lethar
gy, and political vegetation. Individual
happiness is an aggregate of public welfare.
If it be true, that they, can have no solid
enjoyment, even of their own.wealth, in
an exhausted and declining date, it follows
that those are the wisest who preserve their
own through the public intered. Hence it
follpws, that those half-witted, cunning J
mortals, wn"o purfne'the dictates ofa ftiere
felfifh intered, can have no praise for exer- !
cifing a faculty common to the brute crea
tion ; but fatally, in the present period,
the old goflipping maxim prevails, he mud
be the wisest man who does the mod for
himfelf; and the alarmid, who barters his
anxiety for vast wealth, is a paragon of wis
dom ; though, perhaps, when they pass off
the dage, they may have a claim to the
well-known epitaph of a Persian king,
" that he enjoyed life, had what he ate and
drank, and that every thing else was va
nity j" au epitaph which Aridotle consi
ders not as fit for a man, but a hog.
In o*ur rewards and promotions, tnerit is
lead confidcred; âwriters oflafcourousworks
of national in ft ruction, are starved; while
the flippant authors of pamphlets are re
warded with princely fortunes. To inform j
is deemed presumptuous; to delude, is allow,
edj benyvplence and wisdom pass for infir
mity;' and fraudulent imposture is deemed
the bed proof of ability; while 110 reason can
be assigned for many important appoiiitr
ments, save only that they arc prizes in the
date lottery of official afangements. Our
enemies, it is but too true, pursue a contra
ry plan 4 and avail themselves of literacy gra
tification. Bift, on the contrary, if we,
look back to the feveri yeai*> war, we (kail
find every species of merit rewarded. In
1 759> a rfwsrd was advertised ia the
London Gazettt, by the Admiralty, to
the writer of a letter to a newspaper, if he
would perfor.ally explain a national propofi
tjon for pufelie welfare. Such reasons pre
vailedâ-for all the state offices and appoint
ments, that probably othcrwife would uot,
have beep ch .a T*edi>y a general ballot.
The pyramid of Lord Chatham's admin
istration was fouaded ,on the wide base of
ifcerit, of graduated arrangements and pro
motions, of approved services, while his own
genius prefixed and crowned the summit of
the edifice.
" Those who are lighted ly a lamp Jhvuld
fesdit with oil:" the just reproach of Anax
agoras to Pericles, was not applicable to
Lord Chatham, Otnnifcience is not'the por
tion of men; he was not ashamed of acknow
ledging inftruÂ£tions'( to use his own words)
not only by praise, but by promotion. If
lord Chatham derived his naval science from
the Lamp of Lord Anfor.'s experience, be
it remembered, that that lamp was rendered
more beneficially eonfpicious by its just po
rtion and fair elevation. The pnfthumous
eulogium of Lord Chatham, in paints
the true character of Lord â  Asfon, who
would wi(h to aVnplify the defcriptibrt of
Anaxagoras, traced'by Perk ts or retouch

SUMMARY.
INCIDENTS ABROAD.
The French mirnicks, it i'<ems, are now
performing the last aft of their monstrous
farce of liberty. Bitter Jealousy rankles
among the council of five hundred, ambition
dictates the councils the dire&ory, and
tbe Grand Turk of , iitary despotism arÂ»
bitrarily governs the free and equal Parisian.
The eonftitutibii is violated by the interfer
ing soldier, two of the French tyrants clamor
for peace, more invoke Ate hot from hell;
the rovrlifts rear their heads, and the dis
jointed fabric of fhawilowy rc publicanifm
lhakrs, like the old beldame of the poet.
Peace at Lisle walks with grave, flow and
measured ftepa. Peace between France and
Portugal is concluded. A judieloifs paflenv
ger iu the Minerva states that England,
though alone, is fuffieient to guard her
conftitnt'on agaifift muting at the Nore or
the invajions of the French.
Spain is' 3 dumb Tffachar, couching un
der the burthen of fraternity,âHolland
builds Ihips, aflis for a De Ruyter, and pru
dently detains them in the Texel, âGerma-
ny fofters letters, hangs op the helmet and
sword, and lefts from the labors of warâ
and Italy is o:\ tar scan. -to Mi* Â»ek yoj.c,
the infallible Buonaparte.
In the London papers *we find the usual
column of wit and plcafantry. Francis, a
noted placeman, is happily compared 50 his
great predecefTor in Shakespeare's Henry
IV. he is always ready with his "'anon,
anian, fir-" This might be pertinently ap-
to some of our time-serving and ob
sequious gentry.
" Better to reign in Hell" is now the
motto of the minority : therefore they at
tempt to raise the hell of anarchy, to get in
to a warm birth.
The long waist is attempted to be again
introduced by certain starched tabbies. This
is the consequence of imperious neceflity ; if
youth and beauty would give leave every
old maid in the kingdom would be as (hort
waifted as Shakespeare's Julietta. A young
woman lately in a fit of love threw a con
gragation into great consternation by at
tempting a forcible seizure of a Jiifs from a
clergyman of the Parish, \Wiile performing
his clerical fun&ions.
Mrs. Inchbald has written an account! of
her life from the age of thirty, which com
prehends the hiftory'of her own times, fu
far as relates to the stage and her literary
connexions.
Mrs. Powell, the aftrefs, though not
partial to the Dutch is said to be not averse
to Holland.

A boat of about *5 tons burthen, with lateen

Cadiz, which (he left on the Jd of August. She
brought dispatches for both the governors of Ha

to them over land.
GrÂ»at secrecy was observed, and very little in
telligence had transpired; it was supposed that it
was not of a very agrecab!? nature at any rate, as
all the money that eould be colle&ad at both plac
es, was ordered to be immediately sent to Spain ;
likeWise ail the uncoined prepared ote and in cafe

From the above information, and at the time of
thiÂ« dispatch boat having left Cadiz,it is not unlike

The â  sloop Difeovery, Parry, from Jamaica for

TO THE PUBLIC.
The following is the Copy of a paper, read
by a gentleman at my request, and in my
presence, to Dr. B. Rush, on Saturday
the2iftinft.
" Dr. Currie informs Dr. Rufli, that he
is the author of the account of Dr. Ruth's
conduft and practice, publifhcd in the Ga
zette of the United States, the 6th inft. and
can produce refpeftable teftitnony in support
of the truth of the fads contained in that
publication.
" If Dr. Ruth is deiirousof knowing why
Dr. Currie published those fads, heanfwer6
because, he believes they will determine the
question, whether Dr. Rulh is entitled or
not, to the credit of the important difcove
rie3 in the healing art, to which he is
to lay claitp, and which are ascribed to him
by his zealous friands ; and also to bring to
an issue the question, so interesting to the
community, relative to the tnoft fuccefsful
tpetbod of treating the malignant fever
which has infeftedandoccafioned such deplo
rable mortality in different sea-port towns of
America, since the year 1793-
" If, however, Dr. Ruth (who profef
fes to make tnjth thf>guide of all his actions
and the leadingobjeft of all his rtfearches,)
(hall make it appear that Dr. Currie has mis
stated or miiYeprefented any fad or circum
stance in that publication, he fliall think
himfelf bound by the inviolable regard be
has for truth, to make apublicacknowledge
ment of his error, and to make every repa
ration confident with justice : For Dr. Cur
rie entertans the old fathioued opinion, that
nothing is more honourable than the inge
nuous confeflion of an error, except never
committing one. Dr. Rulh will doubqfcfs
agree with Dr. Currie, thÂ§t the truth ora
ny ocurrence, can be determined only
by the testimony of refpe&able charafters,
and can neither be eftablithed nor inva
lidated by the event of a Duel, much less
by the weapon of a Ruffian or a Bravo.
On the contrary the man who has recourse
to either of those methods to defend his
char after, or to juftify his conduct, affords
to every refle&ing mind the strongest argu
ment that he is deficient in common sense,
or that his cause is unsound, and will not
bear a fair and rational difcullion. Instead,
therefore, of being considered as a of
courage, a challenge ought to be considered
as a proof of guilt, and the challenger brand
ed with infamy.
" Dr. Curdle withes to avoid a personal
contest, but if assaulted, he will not. be an
swerable for the eo'nfequences.
" No notice will be taken of any thing
that comes frqm the pen of any person but
Dr. Ruth himfelf on the present occasion."
Written t)Â£lober 20th, and read to Dr.
Rush the 21 ft.
Since the above contents were commu
nicate to Dr. Rush, I have received an a
busive and insulting communication from his
for. John, but as I believe him to be either a
lunatic or a ruffian, I tTtould think it a re
flection upon my understanding to take a.fly<
notice of any thing he can possibly fay.

Hague, the id Tbermr.hr sth year
[Z3tb Jvty 1797] :f Je French
republic, ove *nd jrulintiftEle.
The minister plenipotentiary of ttie French
republic near the Batavian republic, to the
Batavian natiolial assembly.
CITIZENS REPRESENTATIVES,
It is at the moment in which the Batavian
people are about to assemble to exercise the
mofc effr.ntial right of a free nation, that of
giving to themselves a conflitution, which
(Ball replace ithern in the rajik of the Euro
pean powers, that the tindei figaed fulfils the
niofl; pleafmg duty, iu addrefl\ng to you, in
the name of his government, its sincere feli
citations upon this aufpieious epocha, and
upon the wisdom which produced it.
In this circumstance, decisive as to the
fate of the Batavians, the executive directory
of the French republic, who have incessant
ly kept an eye 011 the important labors which
you have so ; happily terminated, doubtless'
feel their most lively interest redoubled, and
Conceive that they (hould seize the oppor
tunity of manifefting to the whole nation the
sentiments of a faithlul ally, by the public
txpreffion of their vows for her, âof their
hope and benevolence.
It is not fufficient for them to have sus
tained, with a constant folicitnde, the inter
ests of the Batavian people, in that fucctffion
of negotiationsbrought about by the wisdom
of their councils as wrelj as the eclat of the
arms of France ; to have acquired for them
new alliances as ufefutas impo/ing, and there
by to have aftbeiated them to the grand des
tinies of the French people : They do not
dissemble that fa many advantages would be
iilufory and trifling, without the invaluable
benefits of a wife and a stable
government, whidh are the firft wanta of
people.
But if the dire&ory has been penetrated
with sincere joy on learning that this con
stitution, lo long expected, wars on the point
of being presented to the Batavian nation,
how much is that fatisfa&ion heightened,
when, by considering the whole of your
constitutional labors, tbey conceive the* fee
preserved therein, .;not only the true and
grand principles which preserve individual,
political and civil liberty ; but also those of
wife Philosophy, enlightened by sxperience;
when they find therein, instead of that bad
ly combined mixture of partial sovereign
ties, with clashing interests .incessantly in
creasing, a unity which is the life of the
political body, the concentration of the
sovereignty of the national representation,
the exaft demarcation of powers, the fre
quent renewal and gradual advancement of
the public functionaries, in a word, the peri
odical return of primary assemblies, which
continually bring autliority back to its pri
mitive source, and to the happy situation of
legally benefitting, f<ps the amelioration of
social order, from the errors even of the wife,
and the result of observation.
However the Freiloh government" is far
from pretending to attribute to the grand
work, which has just' come from your hands,
the merit of perfe<Sion,"'lcAvffi'g nothing to
be wished for, and uniting all fuffrages. It
knows that everf human prddudVion is he
ceflarily imperfifft. But it conceives that
here at least the imperfeftions are trifling
and easy to be remedied } as fuccefiive legi
flaturas may, in calmer moments, corred
abuses which occur, contrary to the princi
ples and happiness of the people ; as one
of the greatest civic virtues is to facrifice
felf-love and felfilh ideas to the common in
terest and general opinion ; and as, in a
wotd, for the very honor of the Batavian
nation, it thought proper to to this
code, long meditated, and folemnly as
freely discussed by its national assembly, a
privilege which is never refufed to the im
portant produ&ions of human Industry,
that of having no other judges than time
and experience.
Batavians ! happy Batavians ! No fuc
ceft, no violence has hith'crto sullied your
honorable revolutiou. Civil difcerds have
not armed your innocent hands, and the
good sense of the nation, warned by dread
ful example, has pfeferved it from those fa
tal strokes, by which thi foundations ef
the greatest empireS-fiavd beÂ£u fllaken. It
depends upon you toaffureifflyourfelvesthe
glory of the most fortunate exception. It
depends upon you to give to the two worlds
in which "your industry and your conquests
ltave accomplished things worthy of remem
brance, and which contemplate with interest
your regenerating efforts, the only example
of a people, paffir.g, without tumult, from
opprefiion to liberty, and tranquilly renew-'
ing, and without convulsions, their-politi
cal existence.
This glory is too pure and too affecting,
this happiness is too rare and too great, for
yon not t6 fear exposing both to the uncer
tainty of events. No, you will not fee
without ala'rtn all the dangers to which civil
diffentions, to which the poftpariement of
the constitution, would infallibly lead. You
will refleft in your wisdom, that if energy
causes revolutions, reason alone reaps the
fruit of them ; that between the diffoluti
onof the social body and despotism, which
is reanimated by anarchy, there is only the
constitution, and one moment granted for
obtaining it ; that the ntimberlefs inconve
niences from great delay would strike at the
mother country and its colonies, in their
â political connections, ill tfteit commercial
relations, in* their interior administration ;
and the evils forefecn dill do not perhaps
equal thole which it is impossible todifcern.
In a word, a motive of .another kind,
and which doubtless has not escaped the
penetration of you, legifl3tors, is, that a
cenftituted goverrment is the surest pledge
which states can reciprocally offi&r for the
execution of treaties ; and that in this re
fpeft things could not bt equal between the
two powers, as long as the destiny of the
Batavian people should remain liable to the
uncertain course ot political difctifiions, aud
( to the ilormy chacce of contrary opinions.'
From all these important considerations,
the Executive Dire dory wifli to persuade
themfelvcsrtljjit that reftitude of judgment
which eminently diflinguifhes the Batavian
people, will not permit-them to be diverted
-from their^p/interefts ; and that they will
not fail to accept favourably a social ocm
paft which pronjifes them such great advan
tages, which annihilates all diftinftion and
every hope of party, which renders to them
political rank -andconlalidates their exiltence,
the zeal to their tranquility, and
re-opens a field to their indnftiy ; and he
pleases beforehand, in the agree
i able profpeft which the acceptance of* the
project of a constitution offers to them, which
lias their fuffrage and all their viewsâthe
i return of the ancient Batavian glory, of that
national cnthufiafmof which we have just
seen such honorable proofs, of a considerati
on which your political importance, your
past ftrcceffes and the happiness of your geo
graphical position, have rendered familiar
to you ; and which (houid make you feel
the necessity and progress of a prosperity,
equally intercfting to both republics.
Health and Fraternity,

NEW-YORK, October 23.
The attention and willingness of eheEn
glifh in affording proteftian to our floating
property, cannot be spoken of in too strong
terms of praise. " American veffeli, may,
at all times, have convoy, on application to
Admiral St. Vincent, off Cadiz." Of this
we are assured, by Capt. Rich, arrived at
Boston, in 40. days from Lilbon. This at
l tention seems to be general: for, by the re
quest of Captain Sinclair, of the fliip Pigou,
of this port, in cofljunftion with Captain
DaÂ»idfott, of the {hip Eagle, of Glasgow,
bound to Jamaica, Admiral KingfmUl, com
mander of the squadron on the Irilh ftfttion
granted them two frigates, the Diana, capt'.
Faulkner, and the Cerberus, Captain Drew,
which convoyed them as far as the laos
long. 21, where the.y parted in a
tremendous gale, which prevented a farther
convoy from these fhipfc. The gentlemanly
conduft of the officers of the above vessels, â¢
have done themselves great honor, and left
the most favourable impreflimi on the mind
of Captain Sinclair, at well as a sense of ex
treme gratitude for the probable falyation
of a' valuable ship and cargo. ,
By the schooner William and Henry,
Capt. Butler, from Antigua, we are infor
med that the Lapwing and Thames frigates,
had taken and carried into the Iflandin the
month Sept. last, TWENTY FIVE fail of
FRENCH privateers, from fix to twenty
guns, and that one of the frigates brought
in, on one day, three of them, a ship of 20
guns, a schooner of 16, andafloopofi2â
at firft she took the schooner, manned her,
sent her in pursuit of the sloop, and went in
chafe of the ship.
No Colours had been hoisted at Mount's
Hill, as a signal of a French privateer, for
THREE weeks.
Captain L'vingfton, of the sloop Rachael,
in 14 days from Port-de-Paix, informs that
commodore Barney had arrived there, hav
ing been chafed in by a Bricifh 64, aild a
frigate.
The Belviderc, captain Ingraham, from
London, arrived here on Saturday, A Lon
don paper of the icjth of Augqft, two days
later than before received, contains nothing
important. Lord Malmefbury was (till at
Lisle.
Tfie Draper, capt. Coilins, is said to
have been taken by a French privateer, and
retaken by a British frigate fix days after her
capture by the former. This, one of the.
hands on board the Belvidere declares he
heard from the brig Palla6 from Dublin to
New York, which vessel they spoke on the
L2th inft. in the lat. ,pf 42. The Pallas- is
hourly "ejjpefte'd, until which arrival, we
must remain iu the dark refpe&ing the Dra- â¢
per.
Captain Ingraham underftogd in England
that our Commissioners had arrived in Hol
land.
The following gentleman came passen
gers in the Belvidere; Mr. James Fvan, of
Troy; Mr. and Ms. Harden; Mr. and
Mrs. Bradftreet,.-. of England; Mr. R. Ar
den, and-Mr.R. Livinglton, of this city;
Mr. YQU'ig, oF Pennsylvania; Mr. Martin,
and federal other gentlemen and ladies.

THE Mayor and Aldermen, adjusted by a jifft
fdhfe*of the duty they owe their fellow citizeiÂ»,
have the TatisfaSion to announce, to the public,
upon the ftrifteft enqpiry of the phyticisns, they
are enabled to declare, that the maligHuet fymjoms
attending th? saver which lately afili&ed the tows,
have subsidedâthat whatever numbers of ficlc may
remain, the mortal,ty 1aÂ» ceaftd, so that 110
more deaths talte place than is usual at. this season
of the yearâtliat no necessity now exilb for res
training the intercourse, and no danger can result
from a free ingress and egress to and from the
town. And ona f#bjeit so highly interefling ta'he
community, they think it incumbent on them to
add, that the late fever was in a great measure lo
cal, and confined mostly to that part of the town
which is built on made land, the houses occupied
hy people Â»f discordant habits and different coun
tries, for the most. part much crowded, and little
regard paid to pTf|nal or hofifhold cleanlinjfsâ
The natives am! o hci s (old inhabitants) rcfiding in
airy parts of the town, and observing a temneraite
diet, have enjoyed an unusual Ihare of haalthdur
ing the season. Norfilk Borough, Oct. 16, '97,
