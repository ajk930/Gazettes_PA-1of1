LETTER
From Sir Francis D'lvernois, t
to an American Gentleman, ;
ON THE | :
CONGEST or SWITZERLAND,
by the French Troops. |
SIR,
THE fate of Switzerland no longer ,
permits lioc tfi Jfcferanfweririg your letter, in
which will 1 such lively interest you express ,
yen; eagcrnefs to learn the news of Geneva, ;
and f met your solicitude andhopes (till to 1
find *fiat tl* Helvetic Body perseveres in
its fyft- "i of neutrafity.-âTlie tenor of
your -ppia'ifi; of their conduct recalls to mi d
th: e. f-irium pafled on it hy Lord Lans
ilditt. " that human wisdom had taken re
fi: re-in the fpvereign Council of Berne."
I '-iv-n to Â«Â«ora, Sir, that with you and his
LircHhip, I had at times flattered myfelf that
in fcrupwloufly avoiding to give the least ,
umbrage to the belligerent powers, the Swiss .
Cantons would eftape the double fco.urge of
revolution and of war.
This illusiOn is vanished for ever : tlie fin
eft part of Switzerland is now nothing more
thArt province ps France. This power has
tsken from the Inhabitants, theif magistrates
their ljwj and property, :ind not content
with depriving them of their arms, it has de
stroyed even those monuments which brought
to their recollc clion the glorious purposes to
which tK-rr ancestors devoted them.
If yqu have received the French papers,
tin y will have already given you a' fufficient
idea t i this Icc'ne ofaefolation, to lead you
toconj jc~i j' what they have thought proper
to cor.cr..l. I be'ver could have the courage
to isalce' up the deficiency by such an horrible
rec! .al ; fc-.-t j flatter myfelf I shall fatisly
ysp'ur curici'ty aivl that of your friends, in'a

r since the ueginning of this centdryy
there has existed in the Sovereign Council of
feme, a party of oppofitioir-called fatr'ntt,
a.id it mult be admitted that in ordinary <tifnes
this party was eminerwly ufeful in restraining
the aristocracy and moderating it's power.
Butfince the crisis which yet agitates
these two parties became more marked and
diftinguilhed, one of them was denominated
the French and the other the Englj/b party.
Neither merited these insulting appellations,
both parties were exclusively attached .to their
own country,and differed only as to the means
of saving it from the storm with which it was
threatened.
TJiie oTtheie uirectcuny rhÂ« advojw
ncr, looked upon a war with France, as in
evitable ; they few at least no other resource
to "avoid it, than that of being pcrfc&ly pre
pared*before hand and refitting witl* firmnefs
all innovations on tlieir internal policy, of
pr?fenting to foreign nations a firm and de-.
termined attitude, and of submitting to no
afts of cnndefcenfion to Republican France,
which had nbt been granted under its monar
chal state ; in Ihort, to observe faithfully to
wa-ds her, all their ancient treaties, but to
fnffer on her part no violation on any terms.
It, was on these principles, that Steigner
would have had the Diet in 1792 to have pe
remptorily exacted the evacuation of that
part of the Bifhoprick of Bade, which the
Trench troops had invaded, although that
State had a right to the confederated protec
tion of Berne to which it was ftri&ly allied.
The other party, at the head of which was
the treasurer Trilhing, wished on the contra
ry to avoid atl discussion which might pro
voke a rupture with France ; it believed that
in tlie midst of the almost universal Confla
gration of tlie continent, Switzerland could
save herfelf only by the policy of petty States
-âthat of temporizing and delay ; that above
everv thing it wÂ»s impftrtant to arrive at the
end of the war without taking any part in it;
that to reach the port as it was called, they
ought to conceal their grievances or at least
to throw over them a kind of veil, to com
plain of them with the greatest moderation,
x iid not to regard themselves as dilhonored
I>Â£ any aits of complaisance to which they
could submit without immediate danger.
This party, at firft the weakest, did not
fail tc obtain much influence, when the re
peated defeats flf tlie allied troops had fur
nilhed the most powerful arguments of the
?m|H)ffiUiUty ot tbe Swiss re Hiking by arms, a
ration which had vaaquifhed the bell troops
of Europe, and which was.cfceterifed b,y its
victories ; thus the poticyof the Bernois he
came hy degrees, that of tbe Confederates ;
and tliev were much less a ware of the foare
into which they were betraying themselves,
, ,<; France availed herfelf of it at firft with the
greattft circumfpeftion, for the evident r*a
fon that the neutrality of Switzerland cover
e.l her frontiers, on the atoll vulnerable fide.
However, the thirteen Cantons would in
ftillihly have opened their eyes on the danger
which awaited them, if France had not sent
them, for a Minister, her most able negotia
tor, and perhaps the only one capable of se
ducing them. I ought to explain myfelf ;
for in thus imputing to Mr. Barthfcmy their
ruin, Ido not pretend to fay, that he had
fore fee n it, much less, that he was willing to
be inftrumeaSil inefiecting it. He has been
the victim, even before them, of the fatal
ceunfcl* he gave.
In accepting his nomination to the dlrefto
ry, he has afforded tbe more fatisfadory
proof, that Re had abandons! himfelf to die
Lafelefs hopes with which he had lulled tfce
Swif. Magiilrates ; and this will explain to
â¢.cu how he proceeded in obtaining from them
â¢0 rainy ads to which they were fc avert.
[-} always fofL-ned the harshness by the mm- n
ler 01 acmanils, nor did he at cimes even a
I,(T mble, that he pei t'on-iUy disapproved ot
;hen , but he conjured them t<Â» temporise ; \
te tt>>d them that Europe rapidly approach- <
:d to the end of the Itorm ; that it deeply 1
roncerned the Helvetic body, to let it pals 1
without being drawn into its vortex ; that (
they would be exposed to .iofe the fruit ol
all the jklittts lutlierto made, if they retuf
cd-trrtain concessions .which were the uievit- <
able consequences of what had been before
others of a like kind, that he even obtained
the expulfionjof the hanilhed Prielts to whom
Switzerland had given art asylum ; but al
though Magistracy -were blind, the Swiss
people began to awake, and to feel themselves
degraded in the persons of their leaders.
For, Sir, you will agree with me that one
of the greatest crimes that can be committed
by the chiefs of a free people, is to ditgrace
them in their own opinion.
Without dpubt you were aftoniflKd at
the time, at the weakness of the Helvetic
Body, and at the aicendency which Mr. Bar
thelemy had acquired in its Councils ; but
perhaps you do not know to what a point
his personal morality, his wisdom and up
rightness, and above all the sincere interest
he took in the happiness of the Swiss, were
calculated to gain their confidence. I shall
never forget the lively impression he one day
made on me, on perceiving my aftonilhment
that a man like him, lhould consent to re
main, under the orders of Robepierre : he
condufted tne towards a map of Europe and
encompalTing with two fingers the space that
cOmpreliended Switzerland, he said, " No
you will not blame me in the end, if in thus
devoting myfelf I fuccced in preventing the
lava of this volcano from reaching this little
corner of the Earth, so happy and so worthy
of being happy."
Observe alio that at the fame time, while
Mr. Barthelemy obtained from the Helvetic
Government, almost all the concessions -wrtiidi
he Hemanded of them, he covered them
with his shield in aiding them, in d'ifcarding
the h emiflaries who came to revolu
tionize their people, and in rcfufnv;' decid
edly his support to all the revolutionary
Swiss* Hs did yet more ; lie had the ad
dress to persuade all the various factions,
which fucce (lively attained tlie feat of the go
vernment of France ; that the firll attempt
of the kind, which they lhould perpiit, would
pujli the diet to the del'perate resolution of
affording a paflage teethe German troops. It
was by thh do'uble service that Mr. Barthel
emy rendered Himfelf by degrees tbe media-i
tor between France and Switzerland, and
' that the people, whole heart he had truly
gained, fuffered themselves to be drawn im
perceptibly from concession to concession.
If by good fortune there lÂ»d been sent at
fir ft a ralh and intriguing mi niter they would
have been apprised in time of their danger ;
and their prompt union with-the coalition
might poflibly have changed the face of af
fairs. But I repeat that Mr* Barthelemy,
who lulled them to fleepfo long on the brink
of the gulph of Deftractioa, so little suspec
ted its depth, that he precipitated himfelf
into. it ; for he accepted, as before ohferved,
l;.]â K:..* at
Paris, only because he considered the revolu
tion as finifhed within France, and that he
could consolidate it by accelerating a general
pacification. You may recollett, Sir, the
hopes that all Europe reposed on his concili
atory dtlpofstion> arid the great popularity
which followed him on entering France.
In vain was his modesty in attempting to pass
incognito, in order to escape the acclamations
and feliivals that were prepared for him, on
his way to Paris. Never was Washington
received with such flattering tefti monies of
esteem and gratitude,-_ But here terminates
parallel between the two nations. The fame
people who in the month of May prepared for
Bartlrclemy triumphal arches, four months
after saw him carried) as a vile criminal from
province to province in a fort of cage, with
out receiving the Cmalieft mark of pity or
interest in his fufferings, and the official pa
! per of thole who usurped his place now an
nounces as a proof of their humanity, that
having fallen ill, he has been trajifported to
the Hospital of Cayennee, where he ispcr
jiQly tvtlt taken tan of.
However Itriking may be this individual
example of the vicissitudes of a revolution, it
is nothing in companion with the cataftro
'phe of Switzerland. Hardly had the direc
tory rid themselves of Mr. Barthelemy, and
disarmed Austria, when they judged that an
opportunity had arrived of seizing the. tiea
fure of Berne, aid delivering up to pillage
that Canton, and those of Fribourg and So
leure ; a projeft which, they took great care
to conceal, until the moment when one co
lumn of the army of Italy, destined as was
said again ft England, arrived on the fron
tiers of the Pays de Vaud. AlthtJugh this
route was she natural march of the troops,
the illusion of the Magistrates of Switzerland
on this point was diffipa*ed, in a degree, af
ter the events thai took place at Paris on the
rÃth Fru&idor. Those of Berne, even be
gan to replace their confidence in Mr. Steig
ner, when news from Paris announced to
theai-, that it was no longer the time to
have aecourfe to their councils, that they
must.sly to arms, that having waited the is
sue of the continental war, they were now
condemned to sustain its whole weight, and
that the array marched against them alone.
The Directory, not chooftng to trust
entirely to the bravery of this army, applied
themselves with the grated care,, to separate
the ariftocratical government from the peo
ple, and to take from them, if pofTible, the
support of their fubjedls, by endeavouring
to persuade the latter, that they had no other
view than to force the Patrician, families to
divide the adininiftration with the other clalTes
of citizens. This attempt produced no ef
fedt upon the German peojrte of these cantons;
but there was in that diftrid of Switzerland,
called the Pays de Vaud, a certain clals of
inhabitants amongst the towns-people, which
had a long time since been tampered with by
the Directory, who secretly offered them its
lupport. The only thing which restrained
them was the fear of faffing under the do
nimbi of France, jfi accepting her t
nlmance. , c
With a view to tranquilize th:s devoted j
xople, tie' Directory did not helitntfc to de- i
rlare, by their Minister at Batle, " that tar ,
from bciig disposed to make conquclV upon j
the Hehttic Body, or entertaining the Inrail- ,
eft defigi against its; integrality, the Frenc 1 1
Republic was determined to live in peace and ,
perfect larmony with the Swiss nation, and |
even toguaranty, in the molt solemn manner, ;
its independence and its freedom." 1 o g"' e
more wight to these declarations, the Di
re&tjry, four days after, seized an occasion
to fnpjrefs, with irracli clamour, some of the
Paris icwfpapers, against which was charged
a very h?avy crime, namely the intention to
calumniate the Directory, in imputing to them
views of invading Switzerland, contrary to
good faith. Hitherto, Sir, you perceive in
this ftrofce of arbitrary power, only the et
fi-a ofextreme delicacy and (enfibihty, which
had induced the French government to re
fute, with so much clamour, the Imatteft rh
fi nil at ion of a breach of public faith ; biit
read tfe last words of this incendiary arrete,
viz. " and tliereby frighten the Helvetic
people, with rel'pect to the conl'ecjuences of
those rteafures, which it would adopt, to reâ¢
efiailijt them in the plenitude of their righti.
This was you perceived, a new
version of the famOus'decrce of the 19th ot
November, 1792, which, notwithftandkig
what certain writers have been pleased to fay,
has never been revoked, but is at this day in
full force.
But the Directory was not content with
this war of the pen ; for, at the fame time,
they otdered their troops to take poflelTion
of that part of the bishopric of Balle, into
which they had not yet penetrated, This
march phced the troops at the diflance only
of seven or eight leagues from Berne : and
then to compleat an insurrection of the peo
ple, and frighten the it was
notified tb the latter, on the twenty-eighth
day of D.'oemher, " that the members of the
governments of Berne and Fribourg Qiould
an Aver personally for the fafety of the per
sons an! property of the inhabitants of the
Pays d; Vaud, who had applied, and who
might ye', apply, to the French Republic, to
claim, by her mediatipit, the execution of an
cient treities, to the end of maintaining
them in cr restoring them to their rights."
I need hot inform you that there aever ex
isted any fvaty, either ancient or modern,
which authorized, in the smallest degree, the
interference of France in the internal affairs
of the cantons : but it may.'n'ot be ulevel's to
â¢recolleit that a few weeks before this menace
of'an armed mediation, Bilonaparte refufed
his interference to the Grifons, who solicited
; it to prevent the Cifalp'cpe Republic from
seizing on one of their provintes, and tot
whom he made this answer : " It is one of
our principles to intermeddle as little as jiof
fible with the affairs oi" other jjeople." Per
haps it may he neceflaiy to acquaint you that,
the inhabitants of the Pays de Vaud, to
whom France thus granted her mediation
with an armed force, were certain men who
had endeavoured to introduce into Switzer
land, the French revolution nearly aboui:
the lame time that youj government fup
r* 1 ITÂ»JUjmw 1
That of the Vaudois was effected without
the efiufion of bfood, but the guilty were
judged according to the laws of their Coun
try, and the greatest part were exiled, or I
etc aped into France, where they solicited a
long time in vaia the protection of the Di
rectory.
The latter waited only for the termination 1
of the continental war to grant to their ex
. iles their public support. As soon as these
received die firft signal, they passed to their
partizans, who thereon, in ieveral of the vil
lages of the Pays de Vaud, ran to arms on
the tepth of January, 1798, planted trees of
Liberty, and proclaimed a Repilblic Lema
nique.
This fir ft- fccuepafled without resistance,
which is so much the more iurprifiiig, as a
great majority of the people, efptciaLly those ,
of the country, only waited for orders to fall
upon the insurgents, and nothing would have
been more easy, than, to have overawed them
before the arrival sf the French troops : but
the government of Berne llept in such per
fect security, that not even one of their bai
iifs had conditional orders to direct, in such
a cafe, the force of , > people, who should
remain iaithful to their government; and it
was by this unpardonable want of thought
that the loyal people were reduced to inaction:
abandoned by their legitimate chiefs, they
preferred the yoke of the revolutionary Vau'-
dois to that of the French loldiery, and re
mained pa (live, deceived by a proclamation
wherein General Menardaffured them, "that
his army approached the frontiers only, by
the effedt of its presence,. to prevent the cne
.niies of their freedom from fupprefTing that
noble enthufialin which elevated them to li
berty."
Scarcely had he learned that no one had
endeavored to suppress this enthusiasm, than
he pushed on with all his troops to JLau
fanne, where his firft care was to lew, by
way of loan, a subsidy of about Â£45,000
fterl. This unexpefled extortion, and the
irruption ofrthe French, began to deprive
him of the greater part of his partizans, but
this defection did not prevent him from pur.
fmng his march against the German part of
the canton. The coaimander in chief cauf.

Vaud,"
While he thÂ»s invoked their testimony,
these unhappy people in despair at haviuÂ»
been duped by his. firft promise, efeaped
from all parti to join the army of the Ber
nois, where they collected to the number oÂ£
ironi three to four thousand men. It was
thi, column, justly ca l] ed thc f allhfu , CQ _
umn, which atchicved such prodigies of va
lour, to efface the blot of their former in
anion â > aad,it was, above all, that t* which
the meflage of ll* FrP" Djr Â»ry a'lad
td aur â¢-; ii.g the victory,they re- <
preftntcd itasfo much the more glorious, as ]
it was diff uted with tn.common bravery and I
j inconceivable fury. On the firft news of the I
invasion, the two parties of Berne were re- <
united to each other, and it is even laid, , j
that on this occasion the Treasurer Frilhing . i
deplored with nolefs candor than bitterness, I
the falfe policy which had plugged all Swit
zerland into so long and so fatal a security.
' Th#y now thought only of fighting, and
the militia of the .German country ran to
arms with an alacrity and zeal very proper
to caufc those senators to blu(h who had
not ceased to raise doubts of their fidelity
and their patriotism.
They demanded, with vehemence to be
to be led against the tnemy, a-d such was
the intention of thefr general D'Erlach 5 for
as he relied less on their difeipline than on ,
their valour, he knew the danger of luffer- |
ing their enthusiasm to cool by marches, :
and counter marches, the expediency and 1
objeft of which they would not have been |
sensible of, nor consequently did he accept ,
of the command but when inverted with full
and the tnoft wdirniW powers. Hardly had
he received them, but he refolvt-d on a ge
neral attack, fined the day of battlf, and j
made his rcfolution known to his troops,
who, although inferior in numbers, recciv
ed the news with iranfports of joy. After
what palled in the feqnrl, there is every |
reason to believe, that if D'Erlach had not |
been thwarted at Berne, or if the revocati- |
on of his full powers had not arrived till as- j
terthe engagement, the chances would have j
been at least equal.
And it is very evident that the French :
general entertained this opinion, fiuce he
haflened to propose an armistice, in order
as he said, to enter upon conferences for
peace. Would you believe it, fir I upon
this news, the Senate of Berne again fell
into its former indetermination, the party
who flattered themselves that peace was
yet poflible, reaffumcd its former majority,
and revoked the full powers given to
D'Erlach. From this moment all was loft,
and the militia bf-li- ved themselves betrayed,
nor only by the party which they accafetl
of being iftvoted to France,but by many of
theirmilitary chiefs, onrcceiving fron them
orders for certain retrograde movements,
which this new date of things rendered ne
cessary. These peafants,whofe ardent cou
rage was raised to thehigheft pitch on per
ceiving the enemy, and on learning that ihe
Saleurois had been -*ut to pieces, believed
themselves fold, when a retreat was ordered,
and in the firft paroxifms of rage, they fa
crificed several of their General Officers.
This is, without doubt, an indelible blot
on the charadter of the Helvetic people,
but it oughrtto fall entirely upon thofefcaÃi'â¢
alousdivifioniin the government,which,after
having displayed so much wifdoni and capa
city on ordinary occasions, discovered itfelf
so unequal and pusillanimous in the hour of
danger.
It it a grtat misfortune, that Switzer
land did not on this occasion think of nam
â  ing a didtator, or that in its federal affocia-,
a* J town. j'tÂ» 1

cutive.
You already know the deploraible conse
quences which remain for me to reciteâ
You kaow without doubt, that the French
General profited of this moment of univer
( sal confufion to make an attack upon all
points, in spite of the armistice, and he jufti
, ned himfelf for this breach of faith by writ
. ing to the Direftoryâ" In a position so
tritieal, I thought myfclf jiuftified to repel
| force by force, and not doubling their inten
r tion to attack, it remained on'y to me to
pi event it." In (hort, fir, you mull have
seen that according to his own confeflion,
the Swiss militia, diforganited as they were
when he made the attack, 'Â« sustained with
incredible bravery five fucceflive aftionj, and
I scarcely driven from one position, but they
knew how to avail themselves of another,"
, Perhaps you are uninformed that in the
last of these five engagements it was the A,.
. voyer Steigner who biought back the Ber.
. nois to the charge, and that thi* chief of
, the Senate, indignant at feeing his corps
. debating upon the possibility of obtaining
peace, when the noise of the cannon was
heard even a: the gates of Berne, quitted
the Senate, where he presided, to seek death
at the head of the troops* However, it is
not true tha: he had the good fortune to
meetfuch a fate as hath been related in some
papers : the truth in, that he every where
braved death, and was on the point of end
ing his cxiitence so gloriously, when four
pcafants feivjng him as a fh cld, forced the
aged Statesman. into a car, and carried him
in lpite of his efforts, far from the field of
battle. The firft thing which the F.euch
did on arriving at Berne, was to confer, pro.
vilionally, his place upon his rival, the
Treasurer Frifhing j but they did not long
delay to d pose him, on perceiving that they

impreflions.â I well kn-w that even before 1
this lali dreadful event, your Citizens, who '
at firft offered to Heaven their fincereft j 1
prayers that France might take her rank a- J
tnong free nations, have not been able to re- i '
frain from beholding as the mod abominable | 1
tyranny that which the Revolutionllls of j '
the day dare to call by the sacred name of 1
Liberty. ,The only confolatipn I experience '
in the preftnt moment, is, in thinking on
theihree people,who refill with so muchhor- 1
ror the empoisoned doCtrines of the French ; '
they are in truth the only three free people
in the Uv:ivrrfe ; the little Cantons of Swit- i
Zetland, the people of Great Britain, and t
those of theUhited States of America. How i
I delight to repose myftlf on this i ea. Ho- t
mage and glory to recal liberty ! It behoves i

the malk from timfe base impostors, who
have dared to feixe on her Itandards, to '
blaspheme her name, and who would have
made her cdious if ever true liberty could '
have been rendered so jl
I believe I forgot to mention to you that 1
before the attack of the Pays deVaud, Men- f
gaud the new French Ambassador had exerted
his utmflft efforts to divide the members of 1
the Diet, and to break the bond of Helvetic c
Union.
* It fuccecded only in regard to Bade, and t
there merely so far as to caule an insurreCtion t
of a part hf the people, who leized on the ar- ]â 
fenal on the rÃth'of February, at the very a
moment when it was important to march to c
the relief of Berne, Fribourg, and Soleure, i;
the revolutionids. of Bade, who at the fame f,
time poflefftd themselves of the government, â
recalled their representatives frem the Diet t;
and.peifun<lfrl themielves, that by I'o signal tl
a fen-ice they had insured their claim to the si
everlading gratitude of France. But Heave n
you to ju'dge of thieir furprlle, wlien having t(
reclaimed a certain quantity of Brafc* that tl
they pe fie fled in the Ai-fcual of.-Berne, and J
which they prelumed the French had taken C
by miltakc, Mengaud answered theni'on. the v
l?.th March, " That he begged leave to con- t
gratukte tlicni upon tbe attention which they v
paid to every thing' tint related to tlieir own tl
interest, without feeling the lead anxiety "
about the carts and folicitudcs of tlie French Â«
Republic, aud without confiderin ;â  that his n
troops had m f,re neeel than they of tiie arti- y
ties reclaijnsd, for the tonqueli of freedom and r<
the maintenance of the Helvetic Republic." r
This was, not all ; for a few days after, h
this fame ?elei>gaud brought fcr.vard another fci
affair that had bee a long Gnce fettled, relat- ti
ing tÂ» two citizens of Balle, againd whom g
France pretended llie had realons of complaint h
and who had fuffered a verdict with whkh a
Mr. liarthlemy had declared himftlf l'atisfied. tl
His fuecejpp affected to conGder this verdift ai
asan.aCtof deriGon,demandeda new hearing si
of the cause, and added " that he could not di
- conceal that he ihould confideras their accom- n
plices every person who should dare to raise tl
a voice in their favor." It was to this mef- si
sage that the new National Assembly of Bade tl
answered by laconically demanding if they gi
were to underdand by these words the perfoui w
of the Witnesses and of the Lawyers ? ra
It i., evident that a sentiment of indigna- cc
tion and rage forced from the Badois this re- m
ply, and I Ihould not be adonilhed if the re- w
morse yhich they have experienced from fee- ge
ing their confederation betrayed, dionldcar- fe
ry them veryTpon todifplay the fird signal of lc
repeiltance and vengeance. Sooner or later th
the insurrection mud burst out; never wHI ve
j ranee be able to restrain the general despair ty
r i the Swiss, but l>v a numerous army. lo
they are much too eiAiufted to pay such an Ei
army, and the country cannot furnilh its sub- R,
liUence. Whenever this army becomes en- tn
fee4)led, or removes to a didance, the Swiss itl
wjU know how to regain their independence â¢ th
ahhough they are for thegreateft part -.nn- D
qui (lied, divided, plundered and disarmed, it or
itl out of the power of France to subjugate G,
thf.n ; and if llie does not succeed. in de- co

as a signal calumny, the supposition of a pro
. jest to conquer any part of Switzerland. No! j t
fays the General, the French Republic -wifha j t
to appropriate to tyrfelf nothing which belongs 1
, to the Helvetic Confederacy.
t A denial so formal calined the mod fufpi- 1
t cious Genevans,and they mutually reproach- |,j
i ed themselves, for having given way to such \ _
: unjust suspicions of the views of the Pirec- . L
t tory towards them, wlien Defpyrtes, the
: j French resident at Geneva delired a conlitlen
. | tial interview with thole citizens who stood 1
. I highest in the public opinion, to whose con
i GdeVation he submitted the lignal advantages , Â£
they would derive from being incorporated I
. with the Great Nation. Observe, the fame
turn of phrase is preserved which the agents
, of the Directory adapted three months before
â¢ with the American Miaifters, that France did '
. not male the demand, but thought it would be
, more delicate that the offer should came from J
; j them. Delportes added that if they had tiie ; ,
. | wil'dom to enter into his views, and to an-! ,
. j ticipate his wilhes, in expreifitig it as their f
. J voluntary and spontaneous delire, lie wasau
f j tlioriled to grant them the mod advantageous '
r conditions, among others, exemption from *
all military requilitions during the pa I'.at 1
war, the preservation of their warlliip, of '
their academy, of their hospitals, and of j
their property individual and national, Sec.
The citizens he addressed hinifelf to might j
indeed have demanded, upon what- ground j
the French Republic was likely to hj,va a t
â¢ more sacred regard for this lecond treaty,) t
. than for the promises wliicli the had. formerly r
i made, never to make any attempts on their c
â  political independence ; promises to whfcli t
i die had given thegreated folemnityaud. pub- i
, licifcy by fufpendiug the dandard of Geneva r
: by the fide of that of the United States of 1
| America. But they contented themselves t
with requiring from him an explanation of p
the nature of those dangers to which a rffu- t
, sal would expol'e them. " I will not diffem- t
ble, replied he, that Geneva would)>e treated r
as a slate againfl which France has heavy b
causes of complaint."
Their condernation was. at she highodex- f<
treme ; but the danger of the monient united
the citizens of all parties; not one voice was P
heard to comply with the define of France ; (
and the aflembly of the people appointed a f 1
commission composed of all tlie magistrates n
indiscriminately, to deliberate on njeafures '*
for saving the Republic. Unanimous in the c
refolutipn of defending the independence <4'
their country, and above all never to make a
the faerifice of it voluntarily, these commif- w
Goners resolved to accede to all the other de- t'
mands excepting that one : such was thfc 1
tenor ot a note in which they anniui.cul to
the resident of France, toward; t'l-ru Wvf v
March, "the difpolition of" t'lje people of t!
Geneva to enter into every arrn!: ir
which might be agreeable to the Great.
tion, with one fmgle referee ; a reserve 'cf f
which they alone could property appreciate
the value, tiiat of their political independence. r '
" The resident, enraged at this note, which 11
was, ill effeA, a redoubled thb 71
measures ofjrigotir for the blockad.- ofGeneva, I
which, Ghee the occupation, of Savoy, is fur- *1
r<mnd'-d on every fide by the iVench territo- r;
ry. He went fartherâhe informed the in- Â«
habitatys that it they did not chufe to ne'jo- f (
ciate with good grace-with him, they might al
treat with the victorious army, then at their lr
gates." As they had declared to him before- Â»
hand that they would not have recourie to i
any physical refinance against open force, but '1
that they would prefer the peril of such an t{
attempt to the dilgrace Of erasing themselves G
from the number of sovereign and indepen- ni
dent dates, this menace neither intimidated P 1
nor disunited them. It is truly remarkable, Â»l
that at this period, when it was not to lie ti
filppofed that the resentments arising from fe
their political diflentions were quite extui- P 1
gui (lied, and under tV distress of a blockade,
which ruined the lower clafles of people by
railing the price of provisions, the fear of be
coming Frenchmen, and the ardour to re
main Genevans, was such that not a voice
was railed, not a whisper was heard, to fug
ged a wifli of union with France. For some
few days the Genevans had a gleam of hope ;
letters were received from Paris which stated,
that the conduct of the Directory was' uni
verfaily censured (even by the Jacobin par
ty) that every one there blamed this fcanda- t) '
lous abuse of power against the firft state of .
Europe, which had acknowledged the French W
Republic, the firft with whom it had made a
treaty of peace, the firft who revolutionized C Â°
ttfclf to pleale France They added-that
the lalt remains of lhame would restrain the '
lJirectory, that all the memb.rs d.d not agree Z'
on the expediency of this attempt, and that
Geneva would yet be saved if she could fut
ceed without a rupture to reach- the end of n Â°

the evening that they permitted, or rather
that they ordered the coinmiffioners to alTem-

Geneva with France. And the Relideiu!
wrote tlit 'i.- x* day to Paris that Geneva was
j in the height of joy -and hippinefs and that tie
e Genevan branch was worthy to figure in the
French fasces.
There is on; anecdote which is worthy of
I being preferv. d, and ought to serve as itef- I
: foil to the jacobins of all countries. The rl
! fijft ail of authority of the French general
on entering Geneva, was immediately to re- Â«
-pair % to two Genevan jacobins and "
â | to dilTolve theli* locictics. You v/ill com- "
prehvnd the cause, fir, when I mention that "
'. thele revolutionists who had n.ot ceal'ed for ~
fix years to exult in the principles, the vie- â¢<
torics, and the magnanimity of .the great
t nation fbewetf themielves to be the most dei- "
i perate in th ir resistance, when thev law that "
1 their own connfry wus doomed to be the vk
. Tim of thefc principies ; and as the jacobins
poir-fs every where an eminent degree ofen
' erijy they ould have been disposed to redeem
1 their pad d-'lulions and their crimes by fly
â¢ ing to arms and facrificing themselves in 9 '
1 refiflancc which could have been of 110 avail.
I The refideijt of France, app re hen five of the
' tonl'equences of their despair, offered to the '
f party oppressed in 17.94., to avenge them of
- the innocent blood wjiich had been filed jit
- that epoch. But they rejected this offer on
i recolleaing that no blood had been Ihed but
-1 by the exjirefs orders of the Reiident Sou
lavie the predecelfor oi him who now propo- y<
. fed to them to demand an account of it. in
i Whatever may be the cauie, the members "
i sis these jacobin clubs are hitherto the only y(
Genevans who have experienced the leaftper- g!
ional vexation on the part of the French ar- i "
my. Their consternation is that of rage, 'la
while that of the other citizens is gloomy, in
concentrated and silent.
I have jufi received the treaty of union ex
acted at the point of the French bayonet, and
which.fchg councils of Paris will doubtlcfs ra- -J
tify at this moment, as an aft perfeftly free.'
The following is the firft article : â¢
Thg French Republic accepts the wish ;
pi die ci tizens of the republic of Geneva for ~
their union with the French people."
" The French Government, considering
that the undernamed I. Mallet du Pan, F.
P'lyernois and I. A. Duroveray have pub
licly written and intrigued againlt the French
republic., declares that they never can be ad
mitted to the honor of .becoming French citi.

for leveral days the conclufidn of the treaty,
and that it was not without difficulty, that F
iny fellow citizens obtained that it Humid be

France, and as one of her wilhes. Alas!
they ha-ve, however, but too nrtich reason
to reproach me for having negociated and VV
