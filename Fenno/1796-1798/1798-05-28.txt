CONGRESS.
MOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, Mayxt.
( Con tin -fd from Saturday'/ Gazette.)
The next question w as upon ftrikingout from
the firft of the bill, " whenever hefhall
judge the public fafety requires the measure,"
and to insert in its place the amendment of the
SeleÂ£l Committee as amended, mentioning
the three contingencies in which the President
may proceed to raise the army.
MY. Sitgreaves enquired whether it
would be in Order to divide the question so as
that he might votfor ftrikingout and againjl
insertingâand being answered in the affirma
tive, he said he would then call for such a di
vision of the question. He had felt, during
the present fefiion, very little dilpofition to
take up much of the time of the house or of
the fcommittee ; but as r\o gentleman had at
all exprefled the opinions which he, Mr. S.
entertained on this subject ; and as the sub
ject was of so great importance that silence,
under such circumstances, could not be com
patible with duty ; he mall intreat the indul
gence of the committee while he explained,
as briefly as he could, the reasons why he hop
ed the words contained in the bffl from the
Senate might be ftruckoqt, and neither those
contained in the amendment, nor any othsrs,
be substituted in their ftead.âlt was his opi
nion, formed after much anxious considera
tion, and which he therefore could not fup
pfefs, altho' from what he had heard in the
house for some days he could not expe6t that
his ideas would prevail generally with the
membersâit was his opinion that the military
force contemplated by this bill should be im
mediately raised ; and that it ought not to de
pend either upon the discretion of the Presi
dent as provided by the Senate, or, what is
worse, upon the fpecific contingencies expres
sed in the amendment ef the seleCt committee.
He had no objection so trust the President %
with the difcretipn alluded to, but as he was
very clearly of opinion that the circumstances
ofthe country required thatarefpeCtable mi
litary force should be provided without delay,
he did not desire to throw upon the President
a responsibility which he was ready to take
upon himfelf, and which he thought ought
j to be borne by Congress rather than the Pre
sident. At a time when the country is admit
ted on all fides to be in danger, he could not
admit the idea of a pro e vifional army ; he be
lieved that the military establishment ought tq
be increased by an addition equal to the oxi
gencies of the times, and that this increafc
ought to be authorized and directed, by law,
in the usual and ordinary form.â
The committee had heard much about a
Spirit of compromise. He believed that this
bill had in its origin and progress grown out
of this spirit of compromise ; this spirit had
nearly strangled it in its birth, in the Senate ;
and this spirit had mangled and mutilated it
in the felett committee of this houfeâfor
himfelf, he always had believed, and he still
believed that this spirit is an evil spirit j that,
on great and important public points of dif
ference, it never had produced, and never
could produce, any good. On a question
like the present, he believed there was no
half-way line, no middle cotarfe, which could
be correftâlf the actual or probable circum
stances of the country require military prepa
-1 rations, they ought to be made ; and if there
is no danger, there is no necefliry for prepa
ration. The spirit of compromise which had
prevailed on this occasion, he thought there
; fore was unwise and improper; it was acting
like arbitrators, whÂ©, under the notion of
splitting the difference, did justice to neither
party, but injuftioe to both. He would not
lay that there is, to use the very restricted lan
guage of the amendment, attual imminent dan
ger of an invasion ; but if there are any ap
pearances, in the state of our foreign relati
ons, to juftify a reasonable belief that in one,
two, or three years hence, war may be made
upon us in our own territory, he believed it
w as the of Coiigrefs, notv to
begin to make preparations to meet it. If we
should wait until the danger becomes imminent y \
before we commence the railing of an army, :
we shall wait too long. Much time is requi- I
site to be employed in the railing and organ
izing a regular army ; and much more be/ore
it can be disciplined so as to be efficient. He
agreed with thole gentlemen who believed
that a regular army was most to be depended
upon in time of declared war ; but he suppo
sed it would be conceded that such an army,
in its early infancy, consisting of raw recruits,
imperfeifly disciplined, is much feebler and
much less to be relied on than the militia of
the Country, who supply the defeÂ£Vof disci
pline by principle and enthusiasmâThe mi
litia will be composed of men, having a com
mort interest in the community, who take the
field to fight pro aris et focis, for their own
preservation and the protection ot their fami
lies?, connexions, friendsand country : where
as a regular army in this, as in all otlicr coun
tries, will be made up, in a great measure, of
the idle and the profligate, who have no pro
perty to defend, who are without employ
ment, and without industry to seek itâln this
observation, he begged it to be undefftood
that he referred to the private soldiery and
not to the officersâlf therefore the bill was
calculated only for cases of invasion, or of im
minent dangef of fnvafion, there #Oll id be 110
doubt but the immediate resource of the na
tion qmft be in its militia ; it is a joke to talk
of raising a regular army to repel an invasion
which has occurred, or which is, as it were, at
our door. Before a regular army, commenc
ed thus late, could operate effectually, the
enemy will have effected their lodgment, in
the heart of the country, will have taken oiu?
chief towns, and have fortified them against
our attacks. For all purposes therefore of
temporary defence, he presumed the hopes of
the nation niuft reft on the militia and on the
volunteers. He understood the army, con
templated by this bill, to be deligned to meet
that state of rhinos when one or two years
hence, all obstacles being removed which at
present oppose thcmfelyes, on the ocean, to
the enterprizes of France, she may be left at
liberty to reek her vengeance upon us, by a
powerful invasion ofthe territory ot the Uni
ted States. This is a state of things which we
ought to anticipate, whether the projetled
expedition against England should fucceedor
fail, it is alike reasonable so expect that un
der either circum'iance, itsitlue will induce*
peace between those rival powers : and when
that shall take place, fheFe will be nothing to
prevent France from fending iier ships and her
troops across the atlantic to'the inva:ion of A-
mericaâlt is again ft this period that Congr eft
ouglrt to prepare with a prudent ferefight of
events ; and to be prepared, they cannot begin
* too soon. According to all ordinary calcula
tions, they will not, even if they begin now*
have their army in a state of efficient readi-*
ness before it will.be wanted. The country
i is not the less in danger, that the danger is not
1 at the door this is a truth, all important, but
* which did not appear to be fufficiently under â¢Â»
s flood.
; He requested that gentlemen who opposed
t this bill would retrace the arguments which
ufed in the course of this fcflion.
t When measures of defence have been propo
sed, when arming the merchant-vefiels nrf
been under d.'fcuflion, ami when it was con J
tended that the public fliips of the United
States Ihould be used as convoys, have they
\ not urged, with the utihoft lolicitnde, that
> these measures rnuft necelTarily produce a
P war ? When the dispatches were about to be
t published, did they not flrenuoufly contend
that it would be equal to a declaration of war*
and would effectually destroy all remaining
hope of accommodation ? Yet, after these
' measures have been adopted, and war, ac
cording to their own reasoning, has thus be
come inevitable, and when it is now
\ to be prepared for so probable an event, they
affett to have difmifled all apprehension, and
[ tell us " there is no dangerâFor himfeltj
Mr. Sitgreaves said, he was ready to avow
' that he had, always, believed there was dan
ger âhe had, all ak>ng, believed that it was
not in owr power, by any efforts, to preserve
[ peace; he had calculated upon the profl gacy
* of the government with whom we were at va
riance, upon their boundless ambition, their"
exceflive arrogance, and their insatiable re
' fentments. He had believed that the ruler*
of France would suppose their individual in
terests to depend on contention with Ameri-Â»
ca ; and he had never imagined that our dan
_ ger could be averted, or would be accelerat
ed, by the measures we had adopted ; and
when he had voted for those measures, Â»t was
* j not from an expectation of averting, but with
: the view of meeting the dangerâHe now be-
I lieved that, unless circumliances should occuf
i in Europe which are not under our controul,
Â» the time-would come when all the difficulties
would be removed which, atprefent, prevent
" | the Directory from pointing their forceagainlt
I this country, except those which they should
! encounter in our own courage and our own
" resources : especially if that fentrment should
prevail which had been so often expreffedy
that a war with France was less to be depre
* cated than an alliance with England. If no
, compaot could be made with Great Britain
that Ihould secure to us the alliltance and pro
Â» tedtioO of her navy ; and when her numerous
fleets shall no longer cover the ocean and
1 keep the fleets of France blocked up in hef
j own ports ; what is there to prevent those
fleets from landing her military hordes on our
, shores ? We mult in that cafe be exposed,
j I alone and unaflifted, so all the efforts of an
enemy whom gentlemen affect to consider as
J all-powerful, and of whose resentments then?
can be no doubt. What is to become of the
Â» immense armies, composed of turbulent and
refllefs spirits, habituated to licencioufnefsi
r and plunder, when they can no longer be a-*
1 mufedwitfi the chimera of a conquest of Great
| Britain? How. will they be disgorged from
France, where their continuance mud be fatal
to the rule of those who now exercise the powâ
* ers oi the government ? Where are they to
find the rewards which have been so lavishly*
promised when they shall have atchieved the
fafety of the republic ? Is there not good rea
son to fear that they will be sent to feek^their
â > reward in America, to divide our lands, and
[ eitablifh a military colony in the United States?
Are we not exposed to every project of this
fort in the south, and from the quarter of Lou
isiana ? âHe believed that these are not exag
gerated apprehensions, tKat they ought to ex
cite us seriously to think ofa danger that may
not be very remote ; and with firmnefs and
Â» resolution ro prepare for the w'orffc He could
not, for himfelf, consent to poflpone, one day,
the raifingj of an army that might be likely ef
-1 fectually to prote* the country, when our
troubles shall come upon us ; he could never
' consent to impose on tha.Prefident the refpon
Â» Ability of so important a measure ; ft<ll less
was he willing, so to confine and reftriift his
dilcretien, as that he could only nfe it when
â  it would be too late. He repeated that how
ever soon our preparations might-begin, there
was a (trong probability that the army could
not be efficiently raised, organized, equipped,
and disciplined, before it might be neceirary
to call them into action*
Solemnly imprefl'ed with this convi&ion,
he inuft vote for raising this army immediate
ly, altho' he had no expectation that such a
vote would succeed ; but placed in a refpon
(ible fit nation, in critical times, he could not
otherwise discharge his duty, than by decla
ring his opinion candidly, and prefling it up
on the Committee. He was sensible that, in
exprelling this opinion, he should differ from
some refpedtable si ends with whom he had
. always aitedâHe lamented itextremelyâHe
: lamented that any of his friends should adopt
sentiments, which, as he conceived, tended
to cripple the necellary measures of defence ;
Â» that they should swell the numbers of those
who had been uniform in their opposition to
1 these measures. Of all poflible times, he be

' While he was up he would notice the ob
-1 fervations of some members who profefs to
f declinfc voting for the proposed armament,
t because on a recent queflion, others had voted
t to limit the duration of the direct tax. to one

the decision of that queffion, or was more de
flrous that the duration of the tax should be
commensurate wi.h the expence which it
was intended to defray r but it did not fol
low, that because thsy had commited one er
ror, they should commit another. The de
fence of the country ought not to be crippled
from an idea that motaev would not be raised
to meet the expenceâlt is our duty to adopt
the necelfary measures of defence, and after
wards it will be our duty to provide the mo
ney. The fcflion wasnot yet closed, and be
fore the house rises, itcoiiid not be doubted
but resources would be found to answer all
exigencies.âHe concluded with calling for a
di vi (ion of the queltion.
The queflion on inking out the words in
the original bill, viz. tf whenever he (lull
[Volume XIII,judge the public fafety requires the me&fure" |
was put and carried, ihere being' 72 votes |
for it. J
Vlr. Harper then moved to insert the
words recommended to be inferred in their
place by the Select Committee, viz. " in the
event of a declaration of f war againjl the Unit
ed States, or of actual invasion of their territory
by a foreign power, Â§r of immediate danger of
such invasion, difcoveredy in his opinion y to ex
iji
The question was carried, there being 68
votes for it.
The next amendment proposed by the Se
left Committee was to strike out twenty thou- !
sand (men) and to insert ten thousand.
Mr. GalhtjN wirtied this question to be
divided, as he wiflicd to strike out twenty,
and insert five thousand. He was led to wish
this amendment from the general agreement
wjiich there teemed to be, and "greeably to
the confeffion jof. his colleague (Mr. Sit
greaves) that at piefent there exills no danger
of an invasion from Europe. If there was a
ny danger at all, it seemed so be confined
wholly to the Southern States, and it was said
yefterdav by a gentleman from that quarter
(Mr. -Pinckney) that 12 or 1390 men in South
Carolina would be very ufeful. If that num
ber would be fufficient for that State, Mr.
G. thought 5000 Would be a number fuffici
ent to be railed for any object to which they
could Ue applied. As for himfelf he wasa
gainfV the bill in toto, as he did not. believe
in any danger, which the militia would not
be able to meet ; but if an army must he rai
sed, it need not be larger than gentlemen
Coufd find an use for.
Mr. Hartley had some doubt whether
Congress ought not then to go further than
was intended by the bill, and vote for an ef
ficient force to be raised immediately. No
thing but the expence, and the strong objec
tions made against the neceflity of ihe mea
sure, induced him to be in favour only of a
provisional army, to be raised on certain Con
tingencies.
The right of delegating the power intended
to be given to the President has been very
fuHy discussed. He thought there had been
great accommodation on the part ol the ma
jority to limit the fjmeÂ»
The President, Mr. H. said, will be in a
very delicate and responsible situation. The
whole world looking on, he will certainly
strive to aft inthebeif manner.âHe was per
fectly fatisfied that the President should have
the power of railing the 20,000 men, or as
many of them as he thought necelfary, upon
one or more of these contingencies happening.
No one ought to fay that 20,000 men in cafe
of a war would be too many. In the yeai
1776, when we were contending against a na
tion perhaps not so formidable by Jand as the
que now ibout annoying us ; Congress voted
88 battalions of infantry, besides cavalry and
arrillery, and afterwards 16 additional batta
lions were voted. '
Whenever armies are to be raised by re- ,
cmiting, you must in thefirft place be at Con
siderable expence in supporting officers with
out men, but this cannot be avoided.âThe
officers should be felefted from the several
states, and diiperfed over the Union.
If we have a war, as the President might
engage men for a shorter period than threes
years, he trusted that the sons of the yeoman
ry oj the country would cofne forth as on a
former ocgafion.
Mr. 11. said, gentlemen might speak as
highly as they pleased in favour of militiaâ
The plan now in view would draw a part of
them into the standing troops, where they
would be better disciplined; and, in addition
to the knowledge of shooting, they would ac
quire that of moving and manoeuvring to ad
van sage.
Standing troops will be neceflary in a war
of any Length. You may occasionally call the
militia ; but it would be immensely inconve
nient to be constantly calling the husband
man from the field, .and the mechanic trom
his labours, and to have the whole country
marching and countermarching. Short tours
of duty in the militia is a serious difficulty,
and cannot well be helped.' Some attempts
have been made to retain the militia in camp
fix months, but they have been diftrefling ;
one instance he woufd mention âIn the year
j776, a reinforcement to the Northern Army,
5000 militia, were ordered out under the
command of General Bricket. They were
very good men, they were in camp for some
months at Ticonderoga; but, from camp du
ty, Reparation from their families, and impa
tience, they became sickly and de pre (Ted, and
were daily applying for discharges.
Where the service is not of long duration,
butaftive, the militia can be ufeful, especi
ally in a woody country. They may frequent
ly aft to advantage in aid of the regular troops.
They performed their duty in union when
General Burgoyne'sarmy was taken. A num
ber of bold and decided men left theirhomes,
resolved that the invading army should be
destroyed or taken before they returned. The
army was taken. âIn several other places the
militia atchieved reputation.
Mr. H. was not for a large standing army in
time of peaceâ-nor in time of war for more
troops than would give security, and be a
convenience to the reft of the community.â
He strongly urged the propriety in the present
state of things, of granting the power to the
President. He was confident it would be
faithfully attended to. Tf any intentional
wrong took place, an enlightened people
would discover it.
From the arguments of some gentlemen,
all is securityâwe have nothing to fearâ
Those arguments have been so forcibly or
artfully used, that for the moment numbers
may be led away by them. Recolleftion and
thought will bring them back; and if they
do not diflent or discredit absolutely what is
said about our security, they mud doubt it
and prefer their own rneafures.
If none of the contingencies contemplated
in the bill happen, no men are to be raised ;
but if any of them should happen, the num
ber should not be reduced from 10,000 men
to 5,000, but rather remain at 20,000.
As to providing the means, Mr. Hartley
was inclined to think that they were not obli
ged to go to any great extent. No money
was provided to pay the militia who may be
called out; but the national charafter and
honour are certainly pledged to furnifh what
may be neceflaryâfo they will in this cafe.
He conceived, however, that it might be
prudent to appropriate or *OO,OOO
dollars at present, to be under the direftioh
ot the President, in cafe troops were to be
raised under this bill, which might be appli
ed towards bounty, or equipping.âHe was
decidedly against the motion for reduftion.
Mr. Harper did not know by what kind
of reasoning the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania could conclude that nobody apprehen
ded any danger from invasion/except from
the Weft-Indies, and that in the Southern
States. He had himfelf said, that there was
dangerin that quarter, but by no means that
there was none any where else ; so far from it
he had declared it to be his opinion that there
was as much danger in Rhode Ifiand, as in
any* othfir part of the Union. Another gen
tleman Speaker) contended that the Ar
my on the coafts'of Franoe r which in gasco
nading style they call the afmyof England,'
may be the Army of America, and the trans
ports collefting jit Bordeaux and Brest, in
stead of being intended to go against London,
may be sent to Florida or against Rhode-Is
land. This, in his mind, was a probable e
vent; and when he saw 150, or 200,000 men
collefted on the shores of France, said to be
for a particular purpose, lie could readily
conceive that a wing of that army might have
another destination. He had not the happy
turn of mind of the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania, who, notwithstanding all that was
heard and seen from France and her Agents,
could still believe that we have no danger to
apprehend, except from the Weft Indies.
Mr. H. believed the mod imminent danger
i was from that quarter, but by no means the
only danger, he believed there were others,
not only great but serious and threatening;
he believed the Executive Direftory were too
wife and had tpo good information to make
an attempt on England ; and though he d.i.d
not believe that we had any ceitain know
ledge of an intended invasion from Europe,
yet it was extremely probable. He was
therefore opposed to the reduftion of the pro
posed army to 5,000 men, because he did not
think them fufficient, nor did he concur with
anothergentlemanfromPenn(ylvania(Mrv Sit
greaves) that an army mult be raised for a year
or hvo before it can be ufeful. Much depen
ded upon officers ; and he believed if these
were active and did their duty, three months
would make an army as fit for service as three
years. He therefore believedan army of 10,000
men might be railed and cÂ«mpleated for the
field, it occasion required, before the next
feflion of Congress ; and lie did not mean to
fay that any danger could aflail us in the mean
time, which 10,000 men, with the alliftance of
the Militia (whose service he never meant to
lose fight of) would not be able to repel.
Mr. H. said, had he been so defirousof de
grading the Militia, as his colleague (Gen.
Sumter) had supposed, he should have cited
some instances of their disgrace, which he
could hav<* easily done. He believed the Mi
litia were the materials out of which a defence
was to be raised, but he still believed that it
was neceirary to have a regular force to aft
with them ; and though 5,000 men might be
fufficient for the proteftion of the Southern
Coast, as they might be wanted in other quar
ters, he should be opposed to railing any less
number than 10,000 men.

IT was, indeed, time to draw our mis
placed affeftions home, and concentrate
them upon their proper objeft, our own
countryâto learn how difgraceful it was to
gratify an inveterate antipathy againd a na
tion with which we were at peace, and tÂ»
cherilh for another, that has never ceased to
do us illfervices, even the rapturous attach
ment of a lover. As an individual, I would
not be so imprudent as to trud a dranger
>Vith unbounded confidence, and I (hould
blush to indulge a rancorous hatred for an
enemy whom I had overcome. Grant that
Great-Britain deserved, during the revolu
tionary war, the warmed resentment of
America ; was not our opposition to her
views crowned with success ? Did we not,
at the point of the sword, compel her ro
fubferibe our independence ? I may be an
swered " Yes, with the aflidance of l'rance,
we did." It is true, that without the co
operation of France, we might have fuffered
more : but do those who give me this an
swer, think so degradingly of the American
spirit, as to ascribe principally to France
the attainment of our independence ? Do
they believe that we (hould have submitted,
hal we stood alone ? The power of the
parent country was great indeed, but the
determination to form a free and indepen
dent government was too (irmly taken to be
relinquidied. But let us suppose that we
are indebted to France for our liberties,
that our own exertions would have been
impotent arid unfucctfsfnl, âgrant all this ;
what was the chara&er of France at the
time (he affided us, and what her objeÂ£t ?
Tell me, my learned friends, was it the
guardian angel of liberty who flew to our
(uecourâthe prote&or of the op pre (Tedâ
the friend of. equal liberty? If so, why
inditute Fedivals to commemorate the cru
el Day in which that friend was murder
ed ? What new chains are these that you
rejoice are broken ? It cannot be that
you mean our deliverers wore chaitls them
selves ?âkind fouls ! if this was the cafe,
it was generous indeed to travel 3000 miles
in fetter* to relieve us from bondage. How
sincerely they must have fympathiied in our
fuffe'irgs, so entirely to have forgottsn their
own ! But to be serious, and to be plain, I
can find but little worth copying in either
republican or monarchical France. Not so
with the country from which we sprang
I am not blinded to its faults, which are
not a few ; but then I feÂ£ much to admire.
If lha.l be my talk to attempt a cursory
comparison between those two countries,
ajn'd the treatment we have met with from
them refpe&ivcly ; in order to ascertain hqw
far the Warm attachment we have expreflcd
for the one, and the inveterate hatred we
have VoWed, agaipft the other, is judifiable
and proper.
We profefs ourfclves to bi freemen ;
we pertinacioully infid upon preserving the
liberty of the press unrestrained ; and yet
no American has, heretofore, dared to speak
of Great-Britain in any other terms than
those of contumely. The epithets "tyrant,"
" monder," " Have," any body might ven
ture fafely to apply to that nation, and would
be sure to gain applause. For my part I
am not disposed, especially at the expence
of truth, to gratify such a savage disposi
tion in any reader be he who he may. .1
am father content so run the risque of be
ing called names myfelf ; âany one is fully
at liberty to call me Tyrant Fabriciusâ
Monder Fabricius, Slave Fabricius, or any
other such ridiculous name. 1 have only
to fay, in reply, that I consider myfelf a
freemanâ ti native, but mark me, not an
adopted American. As such lam entitled
to certain rights that I will not surrender
but with my life ; and among those rights
I deem roc the- lead valuable the privilege
of speaking, and, if I choose, of printing
my sentiments freely, being responsible,
only, to the laws of my country for the
abuse of that liberty. You who cannot
submit to the expression of opinions different
from your own, without resorting to vio
lence to puni(h the man who presumes to
jhink for himfclf, examine, if it be poflible,
your hearts in the mirror of truth, and you
will find them wretchedly diseased with
pafiion, malice, hatred, and many other
dreadful failings : you will then be better
able to determine who is the bafcfl Haveâ
the bigot who fuffers none to think differ
ently frorti himfelf, or the man who allows
to another the fame privilege he alks for
himfelf.
I was not the lad to engage in our revo
lntionary war ; nor will I be the fird to sur
render up that independence I lent my mite
to acquire. My vote (hall never be given for
bending the knee to any nation on earth.
Let us, however, refpedl in another, even
if he be a dranger, or an enemy, those quali
ties which are really worthy of being co
pied. I am not disposed to give to the
government and laws of England a prefer
ence to our own ; but I recognize a strong
resemblance between them. IJo not now
speak exclusively of the conditution of the
United States. I take into consideration
all of our frames of government as well as
that, and the laws of our country. lam
aware, that the Britilh government requires,
at a proper time, forme improvementâthat
some of its genuine principles (hould have
fairer play. It suits us 10 have a republican
government âthe English have preferred,
for several centuries, a frame of government
p3rtlymonarchical, partly aridocratical, and
partly democratical. They allow to us the
right of enjoying 0111 way of thinking with
regard to our particular frame of govern
ment ; why not extend to them the fame
indulgence ? In all essential points the liber -
1 ties of the people are guarded in both. It
is true we enjoy mafty blelfings that the
Eriglilh cannot boad of; but examine our
civil regulations, and our boaded conftitu- j
tions, and it will be found that ii* adopting j
the one, and in framing the other, we have
thought it worth while to pattern after the
Englilh model. No citizen of the United
States can be deprived of his life, his liber
ty, or his preperty, iinlefs declared to be
forfeited by the judgment of his peers, or
by the law of the land. Is an Englishman's
life, liberty, or property, lefsfecure ? Ex
amine Magna Charta, and there will be
found an article guarding them in almost the
very uOrds. "An article so important,"
observes a celebrated Trench writer*, speak- |
ing of that part of Magna Charta, " that ;
it may be said to comprehend the whole :
end and design of political fotieties." Let j
me not be told that the right offufpending
the Habeas Corpus aft, can, at any time, '
cheat a fubjefl of the king of England of
his liberty ; for the very fame , power of
suspension, which, in certain conjunctures,
the fafety of the commonwealth may re
quire to be exercised, is veiled by our own
government ia Congrefsf. Is not the liber
ty of ths press protested by similar regula
tions in both countries ? Are Englishmen's
houses less their castles than our own? What
are the powers of the tyrant of England,
as he has been called, " that king of fea
robbersâthat monder, whose arly law is
power, and who refpefts neither the rights
of nations nor the property of individuals ?"'[
Let a solemn ilatute, || puffed long before |

appropriation is intended periodically to in
vest any one of the branches of our govern
mentâthe President, the Senate, or the
House of Representatives, with the power
of preventing the army being improperly
made use of. The English bill of
declares "that the railing or keeping a Hand

ment, is agaitifl law. Altho' the Parlia
ment found it neceiary, antecedent to the

before an ensign of despotism. let up by a band
of atrocious villains, in a fi-H fuaken with the
blood of women and children ? It was once
said of the Swits that their best produce was
" Man and Steel, the Soldier and his Sword
but mistaking the want of motive for war in o
ther actions, ter the effe<Â£t ojf-.their independent
charafler, Ihev dwindled into a set of merÂ«
mercenaries. They for a long time have been
fouud scattered ov<r Europe in three appropriate
protelfions. ift. Hirelings for military parade,
sd. Doorkeepers to tfoe great : and 3d. Usurers.
The Swiss guards usually surround the pala
ces of king and on a certain icth of August,
they were.maflacrei likefheepin Paris, without
exciting one sentiment of refentpient in their
degraded nation. The love of paace, or rath
er the fear of lofiqg their wealth by war, ab
sorbed every other idea and imposed a fhameful
silence.
" Parlez an Svuje" used to be seen over the
entrance of fcveiy Hotel in Paris, and that the
â¢honor of being a porter might be chara&eriftic
of the nation, they wore a badge which desig
nated this humiliating. privilege.
A great part, perhaps the greater part, bf the
money lenders in liurope are Swiss; in this bu
finefc-they. give way to none, not even to Jews ;
they worlhip wealth as their fummum bonura,
and u point d'argent point de Swiss?' has become
a proverb uÂ«\ivecfally. received, Avarice indiÂ£Â»
penfijjly creates fear, for a spirit of accumula
tion begets a dread of loss and every miser must
be a coward.
While the Swiss had more honor than wealth
no nation wilhed to tceubje. them ; on one hand
there was a patriotic fpi?il*to be conquered, on
the other there was no money to be gained ;
but when avarice became the deity, and peace
the pricflefs of the altar, whenthey became rich
by becoming submissive, a double motive wat
generated : little or no opposition was 10 be fear
ed, and great gain'was tÂ« fee acquired; this
could not fail to.attradl the attention of the
" great republic"; for this my friends is the ve
ry e(fence of all that atfuates the detestable ty
rants of France, and this ajone has decided the
fate of Switzerland.
It may not be proper to exult in'the misfor
tunes, even of the unworthy, but it is certainly
proper to contemplate in their ruin, the point to
which d fgraceful peace will infallibly lead us;
and you ought to make the rational spirit of
Switzerland a negative example forever.
When you hear men preach about peace,
with caution listen to them, when they talk of
peace at any price remember the late difpatchet
from our envoys. When you hear them extol
your worst enemy, (the French) and abuse your
own government, think of the wretches who
have ruined Holland ; and when you hear them
cry out "flop,the wheelÂ®of government" call
themS-zcifsj tell them to go home, and notdif
grace America by calling it their country,
In calculating the value of peace lake the great
fca'e and not the small one of a fewyiars. War
will be found'ceconomical, whenever peace is
difgraceful. At this moment it would be ceco
nomical to go to war even if evej-y (hilling in
the country were to be spent in support of it;
for if you are to buy peace the price has no other
limits than abjetfl slavery and extreme poverty ;
& when like fire war (hould eeafe for want of fuel,
your peace wiil continue only with your wretch
edness: for as soon as you have acquired any
thing to lose, upon the common principles of
combustion, war will break out again. On the
other hand war will have its period if honorably
supported and this is the only way of gaining a
peace, which by keeping up a military spirit
may become permanent.
The French are formidable in Europe by their
artillery and their horse ; the firft, thanklGod,
they can't well transport hither, and while we
continue an undivided people we could match
them in the other even if they had the utmost fa
cility in navigation. Be bat firm, united and
prepared for war, and peace i 9 certain ; but
weak, dilatory or contradictory meaCures will
as certainly invite the enemy hither: their luc
cefs in Europe, notwithftandiag their military
prowess, is more the effect of thedivifions their
diplomatic,(kill had excited than what their valor
won by fair conqijeft. Let us my friends profit
by the example, join hands and exclaim with
one accord : IVewiU have peace with honor, or
war with energy.

Particulars of "the late
DISTURBANCES AT ROME.
PARIS, March 28.
We havr hitherto had but very uncertain
accounts relative tothe late troubles at Rome
and of the nature of the division said to ex
jrt amflng the French troops in that city.-
The following may be relied on as a correct
ftatemeut of the affair ;
ROME, MARCH 4.
A few days after the arrival of General
Maffena, some officers of the etat major took
from thi churches and palaces, a considera
ble quantity of valuable articles ; and, it is
.said, the houses of several rich individuals
were not (pared. Besides, the contributions
had beert levied to a sum fufficiently large,
viz, 30 mil ions of livres, independent of
the expences f>r the support of the army.
A gener.il cry was raised at Rome against
exatlions, and the French officers
were not the lad to disapprove of these rigo
rous mepfures. A great nuitiber Â«f them
afiembled, in the church of the Rotunda,
(the Pantheon) and there drew up an ad
dress to the commander in chief, of which
the following is an extraft.
'â  The rapid march of the army of Italy
toward Rocie, to avenge the assassination of
General Duph.'t, proves, that Frenchmen
ire ready to facrifice every thing to insure
the liberty and honour of their country, but
some individuals, under au'hority have en
tered the richest honfesin this city ; and ta
ken from thence the mod valuable effefl3
without giving any receipts.
" We therefore, demand of you that the
goods taken under different pretexts, from
the houses and churchesbelonging to foreign
powers with whom we are at peace, be im
mediately restored, and that thefc places be
put in a situation they were previous to our
entrance into Rome. Besides the balance
of our pay which we now claim, we perQft
ia demanding vengeance for the robberies
which have been committed in Rome by our
oraduati, and thedevaftating and corrup
ted adminiitration who, in the midst of un
bridled luxury, are night and day plunged
in d. bauchery. You, citizen general, have
the authority in your own hands, and it reds
with you to make use of it againlt the bri
gands who we again repeat it, dishonor us."
This circumltance occasioned, as might
be expefted, a great agitation in the French
garrison, which was toon divided into two
â parties, the one attaching itfclf to the offi
cers who signed the declaration, the other
rep*obating the aft as highly imprudent.â
Several violent fkirmilfees ensued and some
blood wasfpilt ; at length however, the of
ficers' party got the better.
But the day after, the people affetnbled
in a croud in the Tranftiberian quarter, and
aimed with fufils, swords and stilettoes, mas
sacred every Frenchman they met, as well
as several Â»f the inhabitants known to be at
tached to democratic principles. So great
was thtir fury, that they spared neither the
v.ives or childrtH of thÂ»fe p rfons. The
French upon this, united and marched a
gaintl the insurgents ; a warm aftion ensued
I >'nd the loss on both tries >7Sj very donfider- '
| able ; however the French at length, got
the advantage and dispersed the insurgents;
several of the latter were taken and put to
death on the spot. This infurreftion had
several ramifications. The fame day, the
inhabitants of Valletri, Albatio, Marino,
and Ca'lellcr, revolted and after having k l
cd numbers of Frenchmen, marched owards
Rome to aid the Tranftiberians. A body
of troops which were fetit against them, met
them on the 37th. A mod obftinatc and
bloody battle was the csnfequetice, in which
after great lofi the infurgeut3 were routed.
The French pursued them into their coun
try, which they completely r ivaged and put
to the sword every oue whom they found
with arms.
But, previous to this, on the 25th. the
officers of the French army had written to
the citizens of Rome in thefc words :
" Citizens, the vigorous refutation which
we yesterday took as well to faveour own
honor as to puniflithe robbers wh'i hadwifh
ed to tarnilh it, ought to have convincedyou
that the French army is not capable of the
robberies committed is your city, bat that
the authors of them are only ia few indivi
duals whom we hold in abhorrence."
" To atta n the .end which, we propose,
that is to punilh rhe guilty, already pointed
out by the public voice, we invite you, im
mediately to come and declare at the Ro
tunda, the quantity of money, furniture,
valuable effefts or horses, which have been
<aken from you, whether with, or withont
receipts. You need not fear any thing j
your declaration will punilh the guilty. The
army will protcft you, which is certainly
better than the protedlion of a band of rob
bers, who will sooner or later be punilhed
You are not obliged to give more than is le
gally demanded, and that Â«nly on the re
ceipts of persons properly authorised. We
wifhto give you libej-ty, but we do not wish
to fee you pillaged."
Seveial proclamations have been since
publilhed bsth by General Dagelmann and
the Consuls ; and tranquillity is restored for
the present, at least in appearance.
The difcontent3 of the officers are some-
appeafed by the discharge of the pay
due them. As they appsared much incen
sed against general Maffena, he has deter
mined to retire to Ancona. The two par
ties have ferit expresses to the Directory fto
inform it of the affair, and stating their ref
peftive griefs. The restitution of the effefts
takea from the Churches and inhabitants
has not yet taken place, although it was
formally promised ou the demand of the dis
contented officers

communications.
It would be an endless" labor to Rotice all tht
lies and mifrsprefentations that crowd the
of Bache's paper. In the Aurora of this morning,
he pretends to account for tlfe uniformity of the
fenrimentt exprefied by tile miniltcrsof religion
on the kte faft day, by suggesting that they were
prompted to do this, by " circulars iflucd some
weeks before from * certain public office to the fe
le& reverend throughout the union." The office
alluded to certainly is the Department of State ;
and the fails wer< (imply theseâProclamations
were printed for the information of all the clergy
in the United States: they were formed into pack
ets and addrefied to the marihats, and to facilitate
their diilribution by the aid of .the public mails,
they wore separately folded and packed up st the
Department of State, but without the name of
one clergyman fupufcribed, it being left to the
marihal tÂ» add to the fupsrfcription of Reverend
the name of each minister in bis diftriA.
One circumstance mentioned by Bache, in the
fame paragraph is defervingiof attention. He
fays that, " rancorous fulminatioas and party in
vectives issued from mod of the pulpits." That
the minister, of the christian religion (hould ex
press an honed indignation against a pÂ«*ple who
proscribe that religion and with it allfullice aid
morality, and were become rapacioos plunderers,
ambitious and unfeeling tyrants, is nothing strange:
but that thisjufl indignation ihould have been ex
pressed " from mod of the pulpits" in the Union,
as affcrted by Bache, proves that Mod of the clergy
in the United States, and thence we may fairly
conclude mod of the people t detest the conduit of
the French, and are ready to oppose their attempts
to controul our government, dedroy our indepen
dence, aid make us their tributary fiavei.
Several Volunteer Companies arc now
formingin this city. The Troops of Horse
have increased their numbers. M'Pherfon's
Bl.ies are organizing thcmfelves anew, and
it is contemplated to form the eftabli(hment
upon a much broader foundation than that
upon which it has hitherto rested. A conl
pany of Grenadiers has liKewise been eftab
li(hedâit at present consists of between thir
ty Â»nd/orty members : its complement will
be sixty-sour, exclusive of .the officeis. A
committee has been appuintod to offerto the
President the services of the corps, and res
peflfullyto request him tocommiflion Mjor
Thomas L.Moore, astheCaptain.Mr.Jofeph
Higbee as the First Lieutenant, and Mr.
Joshua Wallace as second lieutenant. Tie
two firft of these gentlemen were a&ive and
zealous officers in our revolutionary war a-d
have been since as remarkable for their ref
peftability as citizens, as they were for their
gallantry as soldiers. The propriety ofform
ing a company of this kind must be obvious
to all. In Europe, to every battallion there
is affixed a corps of Grenadiers. An army
has a much more advantageous appearance
when men of the fame height are placed to
gether.
It is particularly desirable that persons of
a proper height for a Grenadier co ps,
(hould forthwith enrol their names in this
company. Thej can no where dfe appear
to such advantage, as in this their appro
priate sphere. The obvious propriety of
the suggestion will doubtless be admitted as
a fufficient excuse for those who, being al
ready members of others corps, and potter
ing theflaturaj qualifications of Grenadiers,
may be difpt;feci to exchange their situation.
Notice has already been given in the
public papers, that a committee is appointed
to receive the applications of perions de
!irou6 of enrolling theinfelves. Let the
youthful signers of the late address to the
President, now come forward and join some
of the companies ; thus prove that as they
have been the firft to make profeffion the
moll: bold and determined, they will be the
ljft to desert them ; let them tecolledt that
th y have given a solemn pledge of their
readiness, at the call of their country, to aft
with all the exertion of which they are ca
paple. Their country does new call for
their afiiftance, and Congress has prescribed
the mode in which it /hall be rendered, by
authorizing the President to accept their
services as volunteers. Let them brir:g to
view the melancholy fate of Switzerland,
The Swtfs fought with the molt heroic
bravery. Their youth have immortalized
their fame, by their magnanimous refinance
to the infernal hordes of savage barbarians
who have dcfolated their territory; but un

HAVING observed an advertifemert of C.
Gullagitr, in terms derogatory of our pro
feffional abilities, we have to request the public j
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to
decide upon the merits ol Â«ach by a comparison of
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta
lents of established artists, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrossing that bufinek which
their pfofeflional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opi; ion must
