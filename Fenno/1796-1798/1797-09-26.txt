A Of THE CAttVfeJ Of TiU
fcisfUR.BASCES BETWEEN THE AMERI
CAN ASD rÃfisCll REj>UÃLic!s,
Addreffcd to the Citizens of America.
MY FELLOW-CITIZENS, '
An excule which was offered for this very
improper correspondence Mr. Jefferfon
with Mazzei, in a certain American papeK,
just about ths time he went ta congress in
May la(l, which was soon after the letter
made its appearance in America, deserves
to be particularly noticed here ; not only
on jiccouti t of its being delivered, that
it was the exeufe of Mr. Jefferfon himfelf,
and, therefore, the beft>6h every
tion that could be offered, but because, it
will also serve to open a further view to a
conne&ioti nfthenveanÃ employedby France,
'and the fubfeivience of other nations in sub
mitting to he made her tools in promoting'
her nefarious views
You were told in that exeufe, my fellow
citi'zens, that you ought to pay no attention
to the charges raised against Mr. Jefferfon,
on account of that letter, because it Was a
tn?.e little private Communication with a
man with whoiji he -.7 as in habits ofint'ima
cy, nnd held friendly corre pondence, who
when in Virginia, was a dependant on Mr.
Jefferfon, ind a republican ; a friend to mo
harchy ,y/h\\t a prisoner to the British in New-
York and a jacobin when under a dread of
the French in'Tufcanyâto appease whose
threatening Vengeance by flattering them
with the opinions of this exalted American
in favor of their conduft.- against his own
country, or to shew his own importance in
iorrelponding with such a chaAfter, it was
laid the !etter wastranfmitted for publication
in Paris.
â¢This is all true enough ; but as an ex"
tufe for the writer, it is to ftie only another
of those felf-contradi&ing, contra-convinc
ing arguments, with which the letter and
its apologies abound. With refpeft to its
being private I trust, I have already fuffi
ciently {hewn, that so far from offering an
' apology, that adds considerably to the im
propriety of f\ich a correspondence from such
hand ; and as to the other part of the ex-
it was written to % man, whose
supple conscience in politic* was such, as to
render him the speckle tool, thus capable of
exhibiting all the prevailing colours of the
rainbow in the little circle of private life,
round whichl.e was doomed to travel, then
certainly was it the more improper, as it was
the more likely to be used to our prejudice,
when the influence he was under, happened
to he Unfavorable to us. \
The various means which the French emÂ«-
ployed among their neighbours to promote
,then views, and the cringing dispositions of
some of them, are only a stronger proof of
the impropriety of any who were yet unen
cumbered, though they would wifli to en
gage in those views, rkking any thing with
those neighbours which might be turned a -
gainst themselves. In the cafe of Holland
and Belgium, under the pretence of setting
them free,- {he obtained their immediate aid
as spies, as informers, and as instruments in
the-projeft of subduing other nations into
the fame ufe,and under the pretenceof guard
ing against the danger from her emigrants,
(he employed a variety of other means to in
duce others, who were not to be influenced
by the fame pretexts, to beiome her dupes.
She armed, and finally declared and com
menced war against some ; and demanded
of others to dismiss the emigrants from their
territories ; till most of the nations round
were either involved in war, or became her
tools to promote her views. The Swiss
cantons were among the few who boldly and
fuccefrfully refiftcd her demands* : While
others were soon reduced an 3 compelled to
" aft as instruments and spies, against those
whose dispositions or fate wa3 yet undecided
in the part they were to adt, io the great re
volutionary disorganizing Icheme of France.
Spain, for a while was one of the combin
ed powers who opposed her plans : But be
ing at length conquered and compelled to
become her ally, or rather her tool the means
â which have been employed through that im
poitant acquisition, to drive America into
her views, serve to {hew the impropriety ps
committing ourselves' too far to any nation
thus under her controul ; at the fame time
that it adds to the variety of proofs which
we have of the commencement and promotion of
those means. The unnatural conrieftion of
a monarchy, whose leading and national cha
racteristic isjealoufy, with a republic, isfuf
ficient of itfelf to {hew the servile readiness
of those nations, of that description, under
the mfloouce of France, to promote her
views by every and the most contemptible
means. A monarchy, a princedom, or a
dukedimi, receiving the fraternal speeches
and embraces of a republic, is of itfelf an
odd enough %ht; but to be crawling on
their hands and knees to receive their orders
from those natural enemies of their exijle,nce,
is what neither of them can do through
choice ; and, therefore, is the impropriety
of entrusting our fee rets, which might drag
us into the fame humility, in the bosoms of
such depend; cs, the mote striking ; and
the afts of some of thÂ»fe dependant nations
will verve as a further illustration of the
eaufes of the injuries and the insults we
have already received from that nation by
trailing our affairs with such dependants.
The acquisition of Spain in the grand
maritime coalition that was to disorganize,
and, in faft, destroy all Europe, was a thing
of no small importance, as it related to the
reduction of the United States of America
into the scheme. Situated as the Colonies of
Spain and America are, and interested Jn
â¢ See their spirited correfpondÂ«nce vriih Barthe
lÂ»mi, the French minister.
f
fotAe of the tVeftet'n Waters alike, it was easy "
to perceive, that the fpbfervience of that na-.
tion to France, was of as much importance
in apcling her in her pretexts for quarellitig .
with us, as if she had poffefied those Spanilh j
settlements herfelf. What this jacobiriical
republic could not find a pretext for, as the
iiery natural friend and ally of the Spanilh
monarch, or accomplish herfelf, situated as
(lie was, (lie found the means of availing her
felf of, from the ascendancy which {lie held
over that etidaved king. Actordingly, our
treaty with Great-Britain, which h-d been
the pretence of quarrel on the part of France
herfelf was also mace the pretence of jealou
sy and uneasiness on the part of Spain. Our
having admitted Great-Britain, however,
into a participation of our right to the use
of the Milfifippi, being too glaring an ab
surdity to be made the ground of any seri
ous objection, a pretence was then raised, of
an intended expedition from Canada, against
Upper Louifiatia { in consequence of which,
the execution of our treaty with his Catho
lic riiajefty was suspended, and in (lead there
of, farts and garrisons ere&ed and manned
within our territory ; reports made to our
executive of the intended violation of the
neutrality of the United States, by the fup
pofedpreparations making by the Britilh to
mgrch through our territory ; while our
foil was aftually erected into fortifications,
and Our treaty broken on the part of Spain :
And when doubts were raised by our execu
tive (after a thorough examination into the
complaint of the pretended expedition into
Louisiana) about the ground# for those sus
picions, proofs given of the adual fortifica
tions ere&ed in our country being at lead as
great a violation of our neutrality, as any mere
Jufpieion of the'intentions of the Britilh to
march throngh our territory ; and the sus
pension of the execution of our treaty oa
the parj of Spairt (in these pretexts com
plained of; our government was addressed
by the mir.ifter of that king, in a style -un
paralleled, except in she diplomatic history
of French insolence itfelf. Not only the
business between America and Spain, b\rt
even the manner of condii&ing our internal
affairs to suit ourselVes, as it had been by
the French ministers, fcas objected to by that
of Spain ; the representatives. of the peo
ple even, with whom a foreign minister can
have nothing to do, insulted and called
# tools to the executive.
This certainly, no one can deny, waÃ *
continuation of the French system, coun
tenanced and promoted by some of cir own
citizens : For whp, that will refleft on the.
situation of the Spanilh settlements in A
merica (poffefiing every temptation the
inhabitants of the western parts of the U
nited States, and fubjed at a moment's
warning to be swept away) can suppose,
that they would be so imprudent, of their
own accord, as to insult and offend us ?
And )Jie Ftench having no public minister ]
herc'at that time, there is no doubt, in my
(nind, but that the philippic of Yrujo.vtas
only another of those little private commu
nications of some of our American chiefs,
brought forth by the influence of that na
tion over the tn:n:&er of another ; as in the
instance of the one at the court of Tufcany,
who, it is admitted, publifbed the ferret la
bors of his friend in Paris, to juflify and,
etlcouragc their treatment of America !
The influence, the pretences, and intrigues
of France ; the uses made of the informa- '
tion obtained from the communications of
some of our own citizens, by means of that
influence over other nations as well as the
co"-operÂ»tion of those citizens immediately
in their plans, are all very perceivable in
this whole affair'*, as well as some other
things connefted therewith. First, gene
ral Clarke, of Georgia, whp had a&ually
received a com million from Genet, and was
eVir known to be devoted to France, it
was pretended, was enga'ged in the service
of the Britilh, in their intended invasion
of Louifiaiia.
Blount's plot' next breaks out. A mnn
ever devoted to the French ; in the {trifleft
intimacy with the Spanifti minister, whouis
under the influence of the fame people of
no acquaintance or visible conne&ion with
the Britilh ; from & state whole politics
were entirely of the French cast ; (to wliopi
Adet in the scheme of electing a prefiJent
" devoted" to France, deputed one Collet
to promote the plan) advocated by "a sena
tor (violent in the interest of the French â¢,
and defended by an attorney diflingvijhed as
a reporter both in \politics and law where,
let me aflt, are the proofs of his correspond
ence Tjing intended to bring on a Britifb
war with Spain, except in his letter itfelf,
which was noth-ng but another of those
little private communications, which, accord
ing to some men*s opinions, ought not to
operate against their writers! Why, if it
was a Britilh plot, has there never been
one man at least proved to be connected with
Blount, but those of open and avowed at
tachments to France ? Is it because those
of an opposite description are not to be
trusted with the secrets of their own party ?
And why did that exalted character, whom
Blount had labored to have elected president
of America, desert his post, while that im
portant enquiry was on foot; to which no
mere matter of official etiquetteÂ»form, or
private business should have been preferred ?
Was it that he was afraid of being fuf
pefted of being engaged in a Britijh plot ?
. Was it that he was afraid of offending his
friends the French, in affifling in detcding
and puniftiing such a plot against their Spa
nilh ally ? Or was it that he really thought
such a little private communication with a
friend at a diilant J court (which was only
'â¢ " After having heard a certain member of
congress, who is known to be thy organ of ehtf ad
tnirijlration" fays Yrujo.j and then drawl his con
cJut'ons in his diplomatic communications from thoft
Ugifiativt prcmiies.
f See Dalian's report, Genet verfut King and Jay.
j The period to vl'hom Blount's letter wis writ
ten, was an interpreter at an liulian court-, which
interpreter, and which court, were a= honerahle, a
worthy, and as much to be trusted -with ft rU, 1
dare lay, as thatperfon and ilut court to which
Mr. J -a'l was lent.
Calculated to involve JrrJ/ica iii a war) Vvaa <
not wort.h the notice people of. this 1
country ? These art queÃTons I (lioflld like 1
t'o fee answered With all that openness, candor
and sincerity, with which some ot our emi
nent chkrailers are now supposed to abound ! ;
If it was really believed that Blount had
no serious intention of exciting an expedition <
Sgainft Louisiana froth Canada, and there
fore that his letter to Cary ought not to be â¢
considered a matter of such criminal cast '
agaifift him ; if it was from this belief that .
this little private correspondence, let out by
the intdSication of liquor, as the one to
Mazzei, it is said was by that of Canity or
fear, that th? sympathetic forbearance of one
to be present and aiding in his prosecution,
and his continuance in senate was advocated
by another, then do I agree most heartily
with our French patriots that those little pri
vate letters are not of so much consequence
and danger as they have been thought.
That Blount's letters had np real and serious
view to the promotion of a Britijh plot
against Spain ; but that the {cheme (only
seen in part in that letter) was to have an
eSait opposite direction, the evidence of \
every thing that has yet appeared in the
cafe most clearly shews.
Besides the intimacy which Mr. Blount
had with the Spanish minister, it is 1 pretty
notorious, that he was also in the ftrifteft
intimacy, and held constant correspondence
with Adet while in this country. Part of
the plan to drag America into the grÃnd
scheme of difor'ganizing all Europe, by the
deftruftionof Great Britain, which has now '
come to light, and which bears a strong re
semblance (when viewed with this pretended
Canadian expedition) toa French, a Spanish
and American, instead of a British port, it
would now.seem, was begun and carried on
by Adet, while thusin habits of intimacy
and correspondence with Mr. Blount. In
stead of an expedition against Louisiana
from aided by the Americans, it is
now clear, that the peor Canadians had t
naugh to do at home, to prevent thfeir help
less wives and children being flrangled in
their beds, or pa\foned\w the libations m this
holy and pious minijler of the Spanish ally, t,o
be offered up, by American hands. Mr. A
det, it appears, from all the testimony in
â¢the trial of M'Lane, had employed that de
testable Apieritan to stir up an infurreftion
in Canada. Quebec was to be taken by se
cretly adminiftcring Laudanum, and other
atrocious means. Arms were shipped from
France ; and troops were to be sent from the
fame quarter, who, in conjunction with some
of our good French patriots in America, were
to complete this noble work ; while good
majl+r Trujo was to raise the pretence of a
British and an American plot, to discredit
that nation here, obfeure the true laudanum
plot, or, if it was discovered, to have for
it, at least some co.lorable pretext.
So artful, fe horrid, and so wicked a
projeft for exiting treason, murder, and re
bellion among nations, could never have
been thought of and put into execution,
but by the ingenious, the enlightened, and
philosophic admirers of liberty and humanity ;
thf mvrntw and qelebrators of their owa re
publican * marriages at home ! But this af
fair between Adet and M'Lane was another
of those little f private correspondences bet
ween fricllds ; carried on by the influence of
the former over the latter ; by vanity arising
' from the honor of the correspondence ; or,
perhaps, by the influence of a little French
gold ( and, therefpre, ie, with some, per
haps, a thing of bo great consequence !
While the information of Yrujo (which was
also private} of the intended expedition a
gainst Louisiana, peremptorily demanded
blithe attention pfthe United Statesâboth
by its councils ?nd its citizens at large ! 1.
Added to all thisâpur mailed minifler,
home frojn France, nearly about
the time ' this grand French, Spanish, and
American preparation, for diforgÂ»nizing and
overturn ing regular governments, was thus
drawing to A -point. That the circumstan
ces of that recal werÂ« to'be attended with
some little increase of private enmity to the
American government, Was not to have been
wondered at ; but that that enmity, toe,
was to .have broken out ioto overt a3s a
gainfl the government, was hardly Jo have
been expeded. . V et, unexpc&ed as it was,
the recall of Monroe was made a pretence
for juftifying the conduct of France, as well
as holding out frelh hppes to her of suc
ceeding in her demands, from the division
among ourselves. It was well known) that
the d'fpijte betvyeen. the American govern
ment and France, took plaee while colonel
Monroe at that court ; and from the
long and warm attachment of that.gentle
man, to the iritereftsof that country, it was
certain that an approbation of his conduit,
whatever might be the merits of t the recal,
would be considered as a juftification of
France, and a condemnation of our own
government. Accordingly, without any
previous investigation or knowledge of the
causes of the recal, an immediate determina
tion-was formed to juftify the conduit of
Monroe. -
Trivial fails 6fteu throw light upon im
portant designs. The circumstances attend
ing the entertainment given to Col. Monroe,
on hie arrival at Philadelphia, on that oc
count, are not unworthy particular notice
here. At that entertainment, the vice pre
sident, tho fpeakev of the house of the nati
onal representatives, and a feuator of the
United States of America were present.
An address was presented, approving warm
ly and completely the conduit of Mouroe,
" upÂ«jn the information they had on the fub
jedt which information could have been
but limited and partial, ap it was derived
from him who has since called for informati

are discovered.
on hlmfelf; while a pointed disapprobation \j
of the conduit ps the government, marked p
the whole complexion of this politicalfea.lL.: t
Besides the address, the evident tendency of j ,
the toasts was, to approve of thi minister j
and France, and censure that of the govern- j
ment which had recalled him. Without en- c
tering into a condemnation of the recalled 4
miniller, unfieard,- and without knowing the i
whole merits of the cafe, as they have done I
with refpeit to the government, I shall jult i
ohfcrve for the present, that it is the firft â 
instance, I believe, in which some of the
firll officers of government have ever turned j
their moments of feftivity and relaxation i
from public buiinefs, into a serious and J
pointed crimination of the aits of that gov- j

dispositions towards us.
Should this be the cafe, that mission, tho'
industriously represented as pofTeffing senti

however, to seize upon that circumstance to

His majefly lately took a very remarkable
tccafion to express his approbation of the conduct
and measures of his present Miniflers : âlt it
an ejlablijhed cuflom for the Bench of Bi/hopt
to go into the King's Closet on the anniversary
of his Birth-day, and pay their annual homages
of refpett and attachment to his Royal Person
and House. Oh Monday morning, the sth5 th of
June, this congratulation was made by. the
Archlifhop of Canterbury, the speech was
made by \the Archbijhop of Tori. In this Ad
dress no aUufion whatever vftb* made to the
politics of the day. But his Majefly in his gra
cious anfwtr to the Learned and Reverent
Prelates, took occajion to assure them, " That
his Miniflers continue to " pojfefs his entire and
unabated conjunce ; " that he fully approved
of their measures , "and that he Jhould conti
nue to support them "so long as they a Bed up
on the famt fyfltnf," or words to that efeSt.

day were to be conduSed as. in the Age of Cl'ii
valry, Felton the Affajfm of the Duie of
Buckingham, having received an affront from
a gentleman, sent him a challenge; and Id
prove his magnanimity, he cut off and in
closed in his letter, the tip of his little finger.
A meeting of the London merchants and
(hip owners, .was held on WedneSday at the
London tavern, to consider the late decilion
in the law cause of Smith against Shepherd,
which made it neoeflary for them to take
into consideration what means could be nioft
prudently adopted in their present Situation
with regard to their liability to answer for
lofTts at sea. A bill had been brought in
to parliament to releive them, from the hard
(hips.to which the decision exposed them ;
but as the ceflion terminated before it could
be thproughly diScufled, the (hip owners
felt themselves called upon to provide Some
regulation until a permanent law (hould be
made on that fubjeft by the legiflaturc.
The temporary remedy, proposed at the
meeting, as the best means to provide agaiufi:
the inconvenience complained of, was that
of making an alteration in the hill of lading.
After Some diScufiion, in which Mr. Foster
(the chairman) Alderman Curtis, MeSsrs.
Hill, Long, Bonner, Curling, Chapman
and King took part, it was unanimously
agreed to, that instead of the words " Dan
gers of the seas only accepted," the follow
ing words be introduced into the bills of la
ding in future,," all,and every the danger*
and accidents of the seas and of navigation,
of whatever nature or kind fbever, excep
ted." As meeting was but thinly at
tended, the further consideration of the re
solution was postponed.
The French Journel called the SentineHe
fays,â"Lately a bill yras ported up on the
church door in the department of LaSarthe,
containing an invitation to the Faithful.,to
receive their good Priests who were trans
ported, and to reftere, under the paia of
darr nation, the goods taken from the illus
trious nobility. Who could believe that
some peasants were stupid enough to believe
that thtfe bills were ported up by Angels
from Heaven!
Such is the pi?ty of some of the French
peasants, and such the improvement they
have made under the initru&ion of their
Priests?
Two naval officers, as they were walking

when the fellow knocked down one ofthem,

/The follow in r paragraphs are ftlefted.
from Mr. Morgan's pamphlet on " the pre
sent alarming state of the public finances."
" After a fruitlefs struggle of four years,
which has been signalized by a greater de
ftruftion of human life aed property than
ever before desolated the in the fame
length of time, and when every principle is
abandoned which we were firft. excited to
defend, we are now called upon to renetv
our exertions in a contest which holds forth
no determinate to be attained, and
offers no other profpexft of its conclusion,
than ih the utter ruin of those resources by
svhich it-is supported. The extravagance
and the disasters which so eminently diftifi
guifh this war, are not more fnrprifing than
the torpid indifference with which they have
been enduredâ an indifference which has
not only injured but even difgraeed the na
tion."
" One of the pretended motives of this
war, has been the defence and preservation of
property ', and it must afford some confolati
_on to the frieuds of differing humanity, to
be assured, that if it be continued a little
longer on the preficht system of expencfe, it
will be the last war we shall eve.- have occa
sion to wage on that account. It is but sel
dom, I believe, that the reaHnterefts oÂ£"a
country derive much improvement or Sup
port from war and taxation ; and if any at
tack on our property was ever seriously me
ditated in the prÂ«fent instance, we seem fa
tally to have mistaken the quarter to which
our defence should have been directed ; for
while our efforts have been employed with
various success against the ravages of our e
neniies abroad,, they appear to have opposed
a very feeble resistance to the depredations
of our more formidable enemies at home."
" The effects of the heavy inpofts upon
wine are already felt in the diminished con
sumption of that article. By a comparison
of the imports of port wine in the half year
ending the sth of July, 1795, and the half
year ending July 5, 1796, it appears that
the value of the wine imported was reduced
from 383,5321. to 136,2291. By having
recourse to such methods df providing for
the interest of the public debts, the rriinffter
seems to be more anxious about having a
nominal tlian a real revenue.
PARIS, July 20.
COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED.
Sitting of July 19.
Paftoret complained to the council of an
'article which had been published in the Re
dafteur, refpedtirtg the legislative bodies.
The article is as follows:â" A fort of
anarchy in the deliberations which ought
to be the molt solemn ; unreasonable moti
ons of order, the most fhameful prejudices
and fuperftitionÂ£ defended and caressed from
the tribune, when reason ought to have
wielded against the arms of perfuafioh ; a
lawless insubordination exctifed and encou
raged, who would believe it? by the or
gaifc even of these laws ; and the declarati
on of a refufal to obey them, recognized
as a motive for yielding to rebellion ; the
faithful priests delivered over to derision and
to vengeance, while the refraftory are un
pimifhed and protected by the formal aits
of the legislature ; the emigrants returning
with the banished, are preparing to' arm the
iedtaries in favor of the foreign enemy who
supported them in their exile ; the finances
occupying If fs attention thau bells; a re
port ith errors, which seemed to
hive exaggerated the disposable resources
for the purpose of eluding the establishment
of new resources, &c.
1 " Who will be surprised that we eon
' eeive unfavorable omens ? Ah ! though vo
lumts have been written in recounting the
tragical history of the calamities of the
revolution, it will be ho less terrible a task
to trace in perfpeÂ£tive those which they are
preparing for us. Tacitus used to fay,
when speaking of the senators in the time
of Tiberius, " tempore ilia adeo infe&a,
Ut ortnes fenatores quicuncjue certatim ex
furgerent faedaque et nimia conferent."
These tiijies were so infeÂ£ted with corrup
tion, that all the senators were seized with
a desire of delivering opinions as ridiculous
as they we're vile. Thus, adds the histo
rian, Tiberius used to cry every time that
he went out of the senate, 0 homines ad
fervitulem paritns ! Let us take care that
the times of Tiberius do not return."
" I (hall make no remarks upon the fore
going," said Paftoret, " but move that a
message be sent to the directory to require
of it an account of the measures which have
been taken to prosecute the author of this
article."âDecreed.
* Sitting of July 22.
On the motion of Gitbert DefmolJeres, a
project of a rtfolution refpe<fting"finanee was
adopted.
The executive direftory wrote that it was
ignorant who marked out the march of the
troops,and that they hitherto trusted citizen
Lefage, commiffarv of war, of Charleville,
to inform the municipal'officers of La Ferre,
of the arrival of these troops. â¢ '
It invited the council to calife the circle
er distance to be traced, that no error may
take - place for the future. It adds that
some reckon La Ferte 'll, other* 12, and
ethers 13 leagues from Paris.
This message was referred to the eom
miffiori, and like wife the other, which was'
not read,' refpefting the state of the troops
in Paris, and which have passed within the
limits since the ift Meflidor.
The difciiflion upon political associations
was resumed.

have loft fight of her for one half hour, (he
had been our own again. The day after I
arrived at this place, the (hip Brifeis, of New
York, Uound to Amfterdani, was brought
in ; and fix dpys after, the ship Confedera
cy, from India bound to Hambro' was bro't
in also, and seVeral ships from Philadelphia
Charleston, and other ports in America are
here ; and there is no profpeft of either
/hips or cargoes being cleared ; for, as faft
as they try them they condemn them. Their ,
orders are, to take every American thev fall !
in with bound where they will, even if botund
to France, and let the Americans be furnifh-
I ed with all mid every paper that is requisite
relative either to .ship or cargo, it avails
nothing. Therefore you are very fortunate
not to fall in with any of thofc infamous
French robbers ; for so sure as you had, so
' sure France would have been your fate.â

you, which I hope will always follow yoiK

Several merchants of Nantes, denounsed
the scandalous conduft of the Americans
since the beginning of the'war.
I have not read the whole document, an
extraft of which you havejuft now heard,
said Villiers, but I feel confident that it is
such as to fix your opinion on the pretend
ed motion of order made some time since by
your colleague Paftoret : This is not the
time to enter into a difcuflion on its merits j
but it will be easy to prove that the directo
ry had not only the right, but that it was
in duty bound to aft at it has done. You
cannot conceive how France hat fuffered
since the war. The tribunals do not dare
decide upon a multitude of cases now before -
them.
What cannot be contested by any one, is
that the 25 or 30,000 vessels formerly em
ployed in the trade of Great-Britain* are 1 '
Suddenly metamorpofed through the mod in
famous machievalifm, into American vessels.
I request that the denunciation be referred
to a commission which shall report within
three days.
And I, said Bergevin, move the order of
the day on the commitment for this reason,
that nothing would tend more to obftruft
the armaments now going on in our ports
with the utmost aftivity, than such a mea
sure.
Lenormint Seconds the motion for the

COMMVNICA T/ON.
If to abandon the sick couch and the bed
ef death be the extreme of inhumanity 5 and
If a generous facrifice of all the comforts
of life, a magnanimous contempt of danger,
and a noble perseverance, to the last extremi
ty, in administering relief to distressed ob
je&s of disease and despair; can give exalted
claims to the consideration and gratitude of
the community, then is Dr. Dobeju, as well
as Drs. Cor, Church and Pleasants,
committee of phy

more circutnflantially infermed of the merits of
this business, by applying to W. Geer may have
'he perusal Â«f M. Slough's letter, and then can be
at full liberty to determine whether or not W.
Geer is not perfedlly juftifiable in attaching him
felf to any other pcifon in the prolecutton of the

It is therefore just that public information fhonld
be given, to the end, that the injured may seek re
dress while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have benn difcovcred are Tru
man Hstrrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several other! who go under fi&itious names. It is
luppofcd that th; lands offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have adual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 12, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the aflual property of William
Dcllwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Cnanninnr, now of Paris, and janies Averill
and other., ot tint State. There is foine grounds
to fuppofo that the lands of Richard Welis and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia,'are under their
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public agfduft purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive thdfe men in future from ipipofiqg on indivi
duafs, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a shopkeeper of some note in this tountry.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view the wickadnefsof those men, which wkm
the public have perused, will induÂ«e them to ex
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July *Bth, 1757.
1 Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was theproperty of William T. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others ; arid further the said Joseph
and Tniman did pcrfuade me to do this against mv
inclination, which was made 0114 011 the icth day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the nam* of
Pardon Starlts to that deed was a fiSitious namo,
there being 110 such person there. To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.
19th July, 1797.
On the 19th July, 1797. came perfonalljr before
me, Thomas Kelly, thcfubfcriber to the above af
fidavit, and made solemn oath that it contains noth
ing but thrtru'h.
ELIHU PHfNNEY, Jtifticc of the Peace.
On the 18th July, 1797, came before me Jacob
Kibby, a |)erlon by me well known and worthy of
good credit, vrho on his solemn oath did fay, that
two of lie parties abovementioned did make ap
plication to him this deponent, feme time in the
winter of 1796.r0 make them a deed for two thou
sand acrns of land iu the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a share of the profits, on thu
sale of said lands, for His so doing ; and that thay
made application several times for the fame pUrpo f,
which serviCes this deponent as often refufed, de
claring to them thut he had no right to lands, and
coulddo no such thing ; which daring attempt on
this deponent's integrity he had related .vrong his
