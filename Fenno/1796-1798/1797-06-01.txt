GRAND lURY, 3 *
THE frequent returns of c&ilits of jus- ,
tice naturally occafibri'us to nefltft tjn ! the << }
origin from which they flow. HoVcver De
painful such review- may be to Dome nations, tiot
to us it can afford nothing luit fatisfaolkm
and gratitude. We trace the origin 6'foUrs
1 as well as of every other authority to the j u
ptirefl source from which any authority C3n 1 ,r
be derived, the spontaneous but deliberate ; r ]t,
grant of the people themselves for whose fca
benefij it is eitablifhcd. Liberty to a con- tor
fiderable degree had fubfiftcd iii other ages
and in other countries, but fuih an exercise
of it as this (notWithstanding the fanciful (0
opinion of some ingenious writers) probably so ;
firft took place in our own. The attempt f a |
â¢ was noble, and the success hiUierto has lie
' been beyond all expectation. Whether its th
. bleflings are to be preserved or loft, must,
in no small degree, depend on the conduit
1 of the people themselves. j
[ â  If they with for good laws, they must ec
choose able and disinterested men to make itl
a them. If they wish for officers adequate to fe
their stations in the other departmenrs of cl
government, it is in their power diredtly or *
I indirectly to fecurethcm by a discreet and
" | judicious exercise of the choice with which w
| they are inverted. If in any particular their g,
confidence should be abused, a plain and ad- "
I", equate remedy is provided. After a stated "
x interval their legislators may be changedâ "
- 1 Without any delay but such as the occasion (<
, j must require, any pubh'c officer who has mis- â
j behaved is liable to trial, puniihment, and <1
6 disgrace. To this may be added, what "
6 probably is not the weakest restraint, the "
* i general odium that must attend a manifeft "
departure from duty in an important public "
employment. _ â
The people at large having these fecuri- â
ties for the faithful discharge of offices of <i
lti public trust, it is fit that those whom they '
seleCt as their officers {hould have some fecu
r- rity on their part. It is not to be presumed, Â®
that men, chosen as they are, should be re- *
w markably deficient either l'n ability or integ- f
p rity, and therefore they have a right to ex- ,
,y I peit that their conduft should not immedi- t
ately be condemned merely because some
K e persons an: ready to find fault with it. The j
" talk they have to perform is of no common 1
A magnitude, both as to difficulty and impor- 1
u. tanee. If in the small concerns of private (
ay life, few men can condudt themselves with ,
6 ftridt regularity and exactness, and unexpec- .
ted difficulties will disconcert even the moil
orderly and discreet, can we conceive the
er path perfeftly plain and obvious for the go
by vernment of millions of men, who, though
lr " pofTefling one common and united interefl,
Â® e have an infinite variety of private views,â
. r tending to divert them from the great ob
lie }eÂ£t of union, even if their underltandings ;
and dispositions were perfectly alike. But '
if to this we add the various degrees of their ;
l l ' understanding, their different means of im- j
by provement and information, the delusive |
and dangerous passions by which many are j
jlk glided, the adtivity of bad citizens, the fu- j
M pinefs of good, until some critical alarm alike j
u s! | attuates both to a struggle which may en- j
ef danger the government-at the moment when !
its utmost energies are necessary, we Caonot '

WEDNESDAY, MAY 31.
Mr. Fowler, from Kentucky, yesterday
appeared and took his feat in the House.
Th 6 House again refalved itfelf into a
Committee of the whole on the answer to
the President's Speech, and Mr. Dayton'a
amendment being under configuration,
Mr, Hartley was perftraded there was but
one wifli in the house with refpedl to peace,
notwithstanding inlinuationa to the contra
ry' ; but he could not agree with the prcpo
'fed amendment, is he wilhed the negocia-
Ition to be left wholly to the Preiident.â
The treaty entered into with France provi
ded for their being placed on the fame foot-
ing with other nations, and he wished that
right to be recognized by negociation, and
he doubted not the Preiident would do it;
for as he mult fee that peace was the dei:re j
of all, he would'take' such Heps as would be
bell calculated to lead to it. He was against
encroachments on the Preiident, as if they
I once begun, there was to knowing where
, ' they could Hop. He thought there Was no
! danger of war ; it would be a disagreeable
' thing for men who fought in the revolution
' ary var, to "be obliged to unfheath their
' swords against France*'", but he trusted, be
p fore they rcjfe, means would be taken, for
putting the country into a state of defence.
' Mr. Swanw-iek hoped the amendment
I would-be adopted. The objeftion3 again it
- it were of a curious nature. It was (irft
f â  said, if France was put upon the fame foot
n ing with other nations, we rtiould have an
s equivalent ; they ought to pay for the fpo
u " liations committed on our. property. Again,
s it was observed, that to offer them thfs,
4' would be to put them in a worse (ituatiou
1- than before, and' that they would laugh at
it such' a' proposition. Mr. S. took a view of
e the advantages which France was said to en
' joy over other countries with respeCt to
bringing prizes into our ports, and (hewed
j that' they no longer existed. He took no
h tice of a faÂ£l related by Mr. W. Smith yes
terday, refpetSting a French prize being
- brought into Charleston, and denied that
0 there was any faAour done to the French in
i' the business, but the contrary. France, he
j said fuffered material injury from the British
rt treaty', and there needed be no apprehension
of their refilling to be put on the fame
ut ground with other nations. He reprobated
p- the idea of being denied the privilege of
IS giving an opinion to the Executive, and
| J ~ said there was no expression in the answer
_ which echoed to that in the speech with ref
its pest to a willingness to retract error which
31, the Senate had carefully reverberated. If
g- gentlemen were (incere in their wiihes for
he peace with France, he could not fee how
n " they could objeft to the amendment. Why
ue fay peace ought not to be made, except re
ng dress was received for spoliations ? He had
to himfelf fuffered very materially in tiiis resÂ»
if- peel, as well as many of his cocftituentS)â
n- and he felt, of coUrse, as ardent a wilh
'â <- Ihoufd be paid for as other gentlemtn ; but
in he did not think it would be good policy to
go to war, if fatisfadlion was refufed. This
nd would be probably to risk the loss of a poiai4
he for the fake of gaining a penny. BefidtJ
th-. it might be, that when these claims came to
uat be fettled, France (like Britain with refpett
J ' c! to Virginia claims) might bring charges (â¢
f cr -gainst us, and not fettle the account. Be
>-as willing to leave that business to be fet
-01 tied by the Executive.'
go- â¢ Mr. Craik observed, the gentleman laftvo
seemed perfeilly willing to entrust one bt-
Iw r finefs with the Executive, whilst he was 2- Â«
the fraid to trull him with another. With ret
the pect to the ground of gentlemen b'ein;
" c '~ changed, he wilhed it might not appear 8
. by. an agreement to this amendment, whici
orj was exadlly the fame in effedl as that whicl
lnv had been negatived. H<? expected the rao
â to ver would have (hewn whereiu it differet
: if from the former, when called upon to do si
live by the gentleman from Maflachufftts.
JMr. Dayton (the Speaker) said the
ber from Maflachufetts would bear him wit
- ness that he did anfwer'the enquiry.
on . Mr. Crafk - fad," if it were so, he hac
nch been mistaken; : He thought there was nÂ»
on- difference between them. He wi(hed to re
j! ,1 pel the insinuation 'that the oppofere of the
( amendment v/ere eneifiies of peace, ansi ene
';)"c mies of France, -which was conlfantly in
filled upon-by gent! e cn' on the other fide.
1 He wiihed to fnew France the fate justice
ler, as other nations'; but he Vas not willing to
cef- 'insert the fentirhent in this nddret. Nor
' did he wiflv to go iata tbe enquiry bow far
they v/ere or were net. at prefect cn tlvj
fame footing. I He had the f .aae objsÂ£iion
iter- against this amendment' thst he had again It
has the one brought forwartl by the geotleir.an
c-ive from Virginia, via. that 5t wai an uncobfti-.
the tutional interference with the Executivf,
l ' le and (hewed a want of confidence in thst
part of the government, v.!;ch wag at pu
,llf. sent peculiai-ly improper to be (hewn. This
c h ] consideration bad been treated very lightly,
that It was true that foreign politics had too
I.we much mixed in the political conduft of per.
r t(l - sons in this country ; and he believed the
'.'V diftinguilhing feature betu-ccn the two par
-1 '?â  ties was, that one wi(hed to grasp all power
in the Hcqfe of Representatives, and llie
I\ji er other to maintain the other branches iff
ed ; exercise of their.Cbr.ftitutional powers. He
1 the thought this amendment was calculated to
inif- promote the views of the former. The
f rm * fame design of extending that power, lpd
led them to decide the right to decide Ui(on
.; n treaties, and to break treaties. He-srfled
,t of whether the power they were aboubt to e*-
. alÂ« ercife was a legiPatfre or an executive ftfl ?It it w;rc inU.idjd (aÂ» duuhticfr it wai) to t plase.
jn3-.rjr.ce thi Ex:cu*iv.r, it was certainly of ty.in
the Utter kind, anJ tli-.-rcfore not t'.ieir b1- Franc
finef9. But it was fa:d the Executive wis tai l,
aujttous to receive this opinion ; lie found It
nothing of this fort in the speech of the pre- t<v> ff
fident, and he did not know upon what tlema
ground the affert'iv^could be made. It was ment
well known, Mr. C. said, that it wa3 infi- be of?
nuated in France tlrat the government and true,
the people of this country had different leagu
v.-uis; it therefore became them to ail in with
such a maimer as to repel the charge ; but that'
if they agreed to the prefept amendment, yet h
t]ie opinion would be strengthened. pon i
Mr. C. concluded by observing, that tho' fame
unanimity was very deferable upon a question was i
of this fort, yet it was above all things to j count
be avoided, if it were tp be at the proposed if thi
facrifice. The gentleman from Pc#mfylva- ough
1 nis> had called upon the Committee to con- asked
vince the French Nation that there was no Mr.
"British influence in thSt House, but he ho- said >
ped they should not Ihew them at the fame to th
time that there was no American mflu'ence. onal,
He trusted they should not shew to them nor t
- that they were all Frenchmen ; that they be th
were divided, from the Executive, and had coun
no confidence in it 5 that the President was T
tinder British influence, and that he could takei
not therefore be trusted. This indeed would ment
be re-echoing the calumnies which had been Prefi
rajfed against this country. he w
Mr. Dayton said the tedious length of ted i
the debate on the proposition from the gen- atior
tlefflan from Virginia, had determined him "
to have left his amendment to its fate, with- tori's
Out taking up the time of the Committee tack
- with any obfervatioas in.favour of it. .The quel
<riticiÂ£ms which it had provoked frÂ° m the proc
gentleman from South Carolina, might, per- and

Mr. D. till ycfterday was of opinion, coui
that, however members differed about the " I
mode of doing it, that there were none who " n

ties. Â°He thought the dispute had been a- " d
boat words and not about substance. He " c
hoped in the remarks he (hould make, he " 11
should be excufedfrom arraigning the French " t
Republic like a criminal at their bar, not " r
only with crimes comro'-tted against the in- , " t
terefts of the United States, but also with " {

If the question were, into what balance j vei
of the powers of Europe we Ihould be cast, un
as a make weight, such observations might of
be pertinent ; but as he conceived the quef- fa)
tion related to the maintenance of the peace ful
of this country, he could not fee how luch fw
remarks could apply. He hoped he should no
not be accused of a want of spirit, if he did ad
not speak of war as a pastimeâos conquer- wt

them, to make them our own ; or if he did fa;

appeared better to express ourselves with a wi
becoming spirit of relentraent,without using w;
the rcige cf a madman. It was not necef- fp
fary to crouch to any nation. But he wish- w

He could fay that he felt the full force of , le
the indignity offered to this country in the P
diffmiffal of our minister. He did not hear F
i With coolness " you shall repeal -this a<ft, p

When he heard this language, even from the n
Republic of France, he felt as an American, n
but he acknowledged a spirit of conciliation,
and a fcnfe of gratitude ( not yet extinguish- d
ed) led him at least to moderate, if not to tl
eKtingnifh this resentment. The reeollefti- d
on of benefits received, would lead him to p
fay to them : " Frenchmen, you were our p
fifft and best allies, when the country we n
called our Mother, endeavoured to reduce f

I would refill the construction put upon the
second article of the Trench treaty. And
he would not only grant these privileges to
the Ffeneh nation, but to any natioc in the
world, that the British treaty put upon an
unequal footing, and which, it not altered
or modified, would be the cauÂ£c of war.
As little would he be disposed to agree
fft the couflruftion which had been pradi
cally put upon the provision article by Great
Britain. It had not been fully established
by writers on the law of nations that there
were any instances in which belligerent pow
ers could consider provisions as contraband,
except when going to a blocksdedorbefieged
' plase. Iloxev* dure would be no diffical- . &

It might be proper to notice, Mr. Day- 1 'o t-e
t'vi said, the op,pofite obie&ions of the gen- expi t
tleman from South Carolina to the amend- M
i ment (Mr. Smith.) He said France would gentl
be offended at the proposal ;if that were "-he a
true, agreeable to the doÂ£lrine of his col- tec,
league ( Mr. Harpei*} it would inspire them ' lo P c
1 with respect for us but he added also had'
[ that France would laugh at the proposal: wifliit
, yet he did not fee how thc*y could look u- natio
pon it with such different sensations at the icn
' fame time. He went on to fay that France felfti
I was already more highly favoured than other not
> j countries : but, before he fat down, he said Fro"
iâ¢ if this favour were granted to France she rlta:i
- ought, to allow an equivalent. Where, he mi&l
- asked, was the cohfiftericy of such assertions ? menc
a Mr. D. - then took notice of what had been
1- said with refpeel to the amendment dictating jcSi<
c to the Executive and its being upconftituti- loCft

did faying to France and the world, "we fear u l
Los our President will not do right, except we Â« Â£
nit direct him." It was said the President met l!l
h a ! with difficulty in his Negociations, which
sing was owing to the flanders which had been
:cef- spread in France, viz. that the Executive
irish- was all English, and the People all !h
not French. Oitthisaccount the French look- m
3RS, ed upon the Executive with a jealous eye. c *

the President is less English, and they lees 1'

: we said they should give their ultimatum ; but
that if the amendment passed, he said, would â¢

ican, make what ultimatum he judged proper. b(

New-Jerfcy had iotruduced a new checkâa wer

r expeA to have heard any such observation, |
? particularly from the quarter from wheuce it wa|

1 Mr. Dayton wiffted the gentleman to C0I)
1 state what he had f*id fairly. Mr. D. re- p rc
I peated.his expreffian. f OO
r Mr. W. Smith said members were not to
, be called to account for what fell from them g r{
on that floor, and he hoped a remark of that no|
; kind would never again be made. He was
_ j not at a loss to know the motive for all the wo
. I anxiety which appeared for the pafling of this j n j
e I amendment. The French had never alked g u
t : for what was proposed to be granted them ;
t he would undertake to fay they bad refufed me
n it. Mr. S. shewed by the correl'pondence j t
. | betwixt Mr. Randolph and Mr. Adet, that
â¢_ there had {been a perfefk willingness on the
e ' part of our executive tc ( make alterations in ~
n the existing treaty with that nation agreea
bly to their wilhes, and that it was nÂ®t ow
k ing to any thing on oar part that it was not
o done.
: All that could be said for the present a-
mendment, was, that it was left lad than the
d one negatived, as there was not a single Word of
[ e in this which altered the sense from the other. Ft
0 He repeated the propriety of making a ftipu
-0 lation for the payment of our twelve millions C;
[0 of loss by spoliations, which if the Fttnch
[ e were not able to pay irt ni<wiey, they might ch
_ pay in (hips of war and frigates. He did
; r not with France to be put upon the fame foot
ts i"g with other countries, because they were
0 . ftipulationg in some of our treaties, which wl
jn he should not like to fee in a French treaty ; ft<
ts for inrtance, in our treaty with Sweden, there qi
to was an article which had produced great in he
ut convenience. He meant the embargo article, to
n _ There was an article also in the treaty with F
U Spain, whttfc, though it may not be injuri- S
0 f ous as it relates to that country, he should w
a3 be sorry to fee it inserted in a French treaty, hi
3 f. | By the t6th article of that treaty, the Spa- ai
, as ! niards were allowed to take great liberties w
ar | with our veffds : when their (hips of war, in
vve j want of provisions, meet any of our vessels,
tet ! they are allowed to take out of them such
: c h ueceffariesas they ftend in need of, for which
â en they give a receipt, to be paid by theii go- S
; ve vernment agents. This liberty he fiiould not
L L like to have given to French vessels, ffrat they S
5 k- might take provisions from our vessels, in
y e , exchange for a lit of paper. 1 here was also
nc l_ an article in our treaty with Algiers, the Â£
the 12th, which he would not have inserted in a
EES French treaty, viz. " that a citizen found f
ex . on board an American vessel, having no paff
was P urt > be considered as a lawful prize."
[j U t It was very extraordinnry that gentlemen t
lU ld were continually calling the Britilh Treaty a
uld bad one, and still they wtfhed the French to
be put upon the fame footing with Bri- 1
,'uld tifh. He would rather gi*e them an equiva
iate l ent " n fÂ° me ot ber way. The gentleman j
, u ld from Pennfylrania had wiflied the committee
t be to rally round the ftandatd of peace (by :
em . which he meant the amendment before them.) 1
he This put him in mind of the story of a re
crs; cmiting ferjeant, who was beating up for
)C y', recruits when the prince of Wales was a lit
;are! tie boy, who feeing feme boys playing at
the marbles, in order to seduce them, fiid that
nted 'hey would have nothing- to do bat to play at
her marbles <with ike Prince. He doubted not
every member in that committee wiflted for
1 re . peace ; Lut he trusted they had too much
1 the discernment thus to be taken in.
raa- ' Mr. Gallatin said, one of the obferva
the tiors made by the gentleman last up, he could
| on- not a (Tent to ; he did not believe they were
The all desirous of peace ; for, if he mud express
d as his opinion, he did not believe that gentleman
pofi- tuijhed for peace. Mr. G. drew this coucle
they fion from the variety of coiitradiftory objec-
This tions which he had urged against the amend
ap- meat. To prove that our Executive wiflied
us of to have Remedied thÂ« grievances complained
done Qf in the Britilh treaty ; he had read letters
i the which passed between the French minister and
to be the secretary of state, in July, 1795-1
1- aa- These letters were written before the Bri
tilh treaty was ratified by the President, and |
nt of therefore it was not poflible they could treat
it our upon the articles contained in that treaty,
atian, especially as the powers given to Mr. Adet
new were given to him before the liritifli treaty
x> the was known. The tranfafbon only (hewed,

J not cÂ»l than that of 1778. But tbe offer to treat

that the Executive had sent over to France "j,"'

But it was uid tWs intendment was big with p r |Â«

which it is not dsfinbte (lie Ciould hive. A.i bre;
article in tie Swedilh treaty wil mentioned,
but gentldmca should recoiled! that this was an tr.ii'i
article cf reciprocity : we have the fame right f^ eÂ£
in a Swedish port that Swedes have in ours; and
as we had .heard great complaints about e.nbar- a

I,This, Mr. G. said, was allowed by the law of had
nations, if there liad been no prorifmn ot the o hl
kindinthe the treaty, that,only provided the q ue
manner of paying for what was taken. As to : w j M
the treaty with Algiers he cimld fee no gonnec- u f 3 ,
tion between that and tbe treaties in question ; I oft
yet, even iii that treaty, free bottoms were al- ! a t ;
lowed to make free goods. Besides, Mr G. j a c ]
observed, this was to be sent to our Ex- ! Jug
ecutive, who knew very well what was meant , f ro ,
by the exprtflions used in the amendment. He ; m j
charged gentlemen with endeavouring to raise
the prejudice Â»f members with refpefl to the enc
treaty question, in order to get them to rally J a |,
round die standard of uppolition to the amend- n4 f
mer.t. He apologised for having so expressly t un
charged the gentleman from S. Carolina with pro
not wifhitig for ncaee, but did not mean tore- -3 t
trail the exprefiion. tea
Mr. W. Smith said, he wilhed to relieve the tis
gentleman from the uneafmefs he feentied to feel
from having made i'j direct a tharge agai.ifi
him; but he would tell him, that he did not
believe (though be bad said ft) that if the-French
were not fatisfied with the terms offered in this
amendment, he would be willing to go to war. on
And now he tho'tthe account sett cd between
them. _ ty
Mr. Coit said, that hiving brought for- â¢
ward a motion similar in its spirit to the one co ,
tinder coufideration, which had not been fe- joii
conded, and intending to vote sgainft the eri
present, it became necessary to give his rea- 6 '
foos. HÂ« did not think it the fame thing. ;
The difference, it was true, was not very [o '
great, but it was so great as to induce him
not to give his vÂ»te for it. It conlifted, we g a
believe, in thisâin Mr. C's amendment, the Cr
words were "on grounds as favorable," and thi
in Mr. Dayton's, "on grounds similar to." Fe
But he thought the expreflion ambiguous.
The question, on Mr. Dayton's amend
