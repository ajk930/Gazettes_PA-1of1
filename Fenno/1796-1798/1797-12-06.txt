BRISTOL, (ENGLAND,) Aug. 28, }lo
At Nisi Prius Bar, a cause of very, grrat j dt
importance to the mercantile world, came 1 so
on to be tried before Sir Nafh Grofe and j 01
a fpccial jury. M'Taggart and co. tobac- jb'
co merchants, of London, struck a bargain I k
with the Hunters and co. merchants of Brif- > c<
to!, to fell them a quantity ps tnanufaflurt . k
ed tobacco, to the arqount of 15001 for a t
bill at three months, payable in London. ' r:
The goods were {hipped off in the latter part si
of Fibruary. ' About the beginning of
March of the fame year, the house of the
Hunter's became Jnfolvent, which was pre
vious to the time when M'Taggart'a bill on t
them became due. They tbertfpre do soon- v
er taardof the failure, than one of the part- f
tiers hastened front town, and overtook the {
goods at Portsmouth, which he instantly t
seized, and would not fuffer to proceed. ]
Now this was an aftion of trover, brought e
by the aflignees of Hunters, to recover the r
value of the tobacco so seized by the defen*
dan's ; upon this ground, that the veflel in
which it was (hipped by the consignors, was 1
a chartered (hip of the consignees, and that 1
therefore it was an aftual delivery to them. ;
The leading counsel for the defendants, '
made a very eloquent and ingenious speech j
> to the jury, in which he infilled strongly on 1
the circumftmce that his clients, while fct- '
â¢ tling the mode of conveyance, had never
once asked the qucflion whether the (hip
was chartered or general, from whence he
inferred proof of no efTential difference cxift
ing between them. Some other pointswere
ably urged, and he concluded by reminding
the jury of the great importance of this canfe
. to the commerce of the country, and of the
pernicious confequeuce which would result
to Credit, the very life-blood of die (late, if
1 they (hould gi"e a verdift for the plaintiff?,
Before the leading counsel on the other fide
nddrtffed the jury in reply, the judge said,
it was his duty to declart, that he had ne
_ ver known a Wronger or a clearer point' qf
law; that a chartered vefÃ was indubitably
the particular warehouse of those who char
tered her, and that of Confluence no'peifon
could legally flop or (Tetain any goods (hip
ped on board such vefiel, without permiflicin
of the owners. Upon this a verdift was in
ftantl/given for the plaintiffs, to the full va
lue of the tobacco.
From thisr decision it will become prudenl
for merchants to enquire, whether the (hips
_ which are to convey gsods be chartered or
not, because, had it been a general (hip,
M'Taggart would We understand, have been
juflificd in detaining the tobacco.
LONDON, September 29.
The message of the Direftoiy to the
Councils upon the breaking off of the nego
ciations at Lisle, is a very curious producti
on, it run 3 thus :
" The Executive Direftory informs the
Councils, that the Engli(h Ambassador,
Lord Malmefbury, having seen the failure
of the late conspiracy, 1Â«a8 thought proper
to retire froririhe republic ; but the Direc
tory declare" they (hall be rtady to make
1 j peace whenever it can be done, confident
with the honour and dignity of the Repub
c lie."

ing as hfs opitiion that Venice would be ce-t

Terra Firm* had a conference by deputati
he on at Baflano. After 15 days deliberation
ue it was resolved to demand to be united tq
the Cisalpine Republic,
th Two deputies had in consequence been
be dispatched to Milan, to announce this re
solution, and in the name of 1,200,000 Vt
ra netians require this incorporation. This
deputation had been referred to Buonaparte
whose opinion on the fubjeft was riot known
but will probably be governed in his decisi
on by the Congress of Udina.

er. Wedncfday morning Archibald M'Neil
les was committed to gaol for murdering Mr.
in- Thomas Kitchen, cordwainerâThe circlim
it. ftanccs attending thit savage and inhuman
er- aft must shock humanity and make 11s fliud
cvv der at a recital.
M'Neil has for forae time pa't iliovvu fymp- h;
toms of a deranged mind, f>ut, whether our- ft
ing to excess hy drinking spirituous liquorsÂ» c<
or other causes, is, perhaps uncertain ; but tl
on'Tuefday night he Ranged through the tt
ffveral streets of this city, tjJJL about one o' I
clock, when lie broke open tht house of the a,
deceafsd, killed him after a long and .cruel ti
cotiteft, plu-tked out his eyes., cut off some n
of his members, let out his bowels, (tabbed, h
him in the pit of the stomach with a shoe- e
maker's knife, which he left immured Â«ip to a
the hilt, and otherwise. greatly mangled his ]
body. He then took hit eyes &c. and a C
goblet with flowers, and with them again t
paraded the llreets Gaging and wh fl ing. 1
As Mr, Kitchen lived alone we know lit- e
tie further .what pafied between them, or t
tljie particular manner in which Jit .Wled (
him, a black man in the neighaoui-ffp^d,;. 1
fays the fcuffle lasted half an hour arpl up- >
wardsj and what M'Neil himlelf related,
that is : that Kitchen' was undre.Ted, that I
he (M'Neil) attacked hj'm with a stick,
that a hard fcuffle ensued, that the deceased
pulled him by the hair, bit him in the hand :
and hurt os*- of hi 3 eyesâThat h:s (M'
Neil's) (lick broke and thereby became
moie convenient for his purpoie, and that
with a piece of it, to use his own exprcffion,
"he worked him up from beloiv" and job
bed" it into his eyes, until wearied and ex~
haufted, he fell back oh hid bed and expir
ed, after which he mahgled his body 3s be
fore defended.
The Coroner's Jury brought in their ver
dift that Thomas Kitftien was wilfully
by Archibald M'Neil.
Much praise is <Jue to Dr. Emerson and
Mr. Francis Watson far their exertions fit
securing the prisoner. He was taken be
-1 fore his worfhlp the mayor, and underwent
.a long examination* when he confefled the
1 faft and related the particulars as they oc
' cured His manner of behaviour was bold
and undaunted, 'and he did not appear to
have any .'ticlination-to conceal any thing re*
1 lative to.t1)Â« murder.
I M'Neil since his confinement begins to
think a little more rationallyâhe laments
his unhappy situation, and those who visit
!* him in prison fay his demeanour is now more
â¢ orderly, and he seems sensible of his ap
n proaching fateâhe repines at the melancho

Mr. Claiborne moved that the petition

h be referred to the committee of ways and
means.â.Agreed,
n Mr. Sitgreaves asked leave of absence for
>- his colleague, colonel Hartley, for eight
:r days, which was granted.
Is Mr. Dwight Foster, from the committee
i- of claims, made a report -on the petitions of
Samuel G. Fowler and Christopher Fowler,
dating that the report made, formerly con
tained a just ftatenient of fafts ; and refer
ring the house to it, they proposed a relo
i- lution denying the prayer of the petition
rr ers. Agreed.
The fame gentleman observed, that in
>f looking over the laws of lall felHon, he foujid
;o that the aft laying a (lamp duty throughout
n the United States, was to take place on
i- the firft of next month. As he nudei'ftood
:o that it would be impofiiblti for the aft to
1- take place at that time, as the ncceflary pro
;e paratior.s could not be effefted.in the inte
y rim, he l)iould move that Â» committee be
y appointed to enquire whether any and what
rt alterations are necessary to be made in that
d aft.
rÂ» The Speaker fubinitted to the gentleman
is whether this fubjeft did not properly cotne
ie under the duty of the committee of ways
II and means.
;- Mr. D. Foster believed it might, and
would therefore alter his motion to, " Re
:r solved, that the committee of ways end
it means be inftrufttd to enquire whether any,
il See."
d Mr. Macon had no objeftion to the mo
tion, except that he thought it unnecefTary,
as he believed it'wastht duty of the com
mittee of ways and means to aft upon the
ie fubjeft, without any special direftion.
in Mr. D; Foster fÂ»id it was dcfirable that
le something should be done in the business
t- immediately, a 6 notice must be given in all
m the papers of any alteration which may be
made in the aft.
as The motion was put and carried.
Â»t Mr. Coit moved that the report of the

a Agreed for rr,ond:iy.
es 'Mr D. Foster said, that a bill paded that
ie house in the ffflion ending in March last,
id feu.t was postponed by the Senate, for plac
id ing certain persons on the ptnfion lift ; he
ie moved that that bill, with the reports on

e, of daims. â¢>
The Speaker said the reports might be
y referred ; but the house krieiv nothing of a
bill afted upon at a former ieffion.
Mr. Foster moved that the reports of the
Secietiry of War on the fubjeft might be

The Clerk proceeded to read the remain
der of the documents referred to, in the re
il port of the committee on the fubjeft of W.
r. Blount's coufpiracy.
The next paper came 01" course
in was the deposition of

that they spoke on the fulyjeft oF running
the line between the United States and' the
Indians, and he seemed to \vi(h to avoid
any refponCbility with refpeft to the Indian
treaty ; that W. BJount. mention his pecu
niary embartaflments, but that he said he
had a plan on foot which he expefted would
effe&ua'ly relieve him ; he said Chifholm
and the Indian chiefs had been with the
British Minister at Philadelphia, and that
Chifholm had a plan in the hand writing of
the British Minister, which,if it fticceeded,
W. Blount/aid he fliould have it in his pow

to place great reliance upon Rogers and
Carey, and upon their inflitenae with
Indians ; he mentioned that an armament
was to be sent from England, which was
t,o. be' co-operated with on the land fide by
him at the head of the Indians. The depo
nent also speaks of having received letters
from Col. King, about the 15th of June,
from W. Blount,,for Carey, which he de
livered, and mentions the conversation which
pafled betwixt them.
Mr. Sitgreaves tools the chair of the
clerk, and said the next,document wgs a pa
per commifnicated to the cjmmittee by the
Chevalier de Yrujo, in French. The com
mittee had not, he.said, 'apy formal tranl'la
tion of it, but he would read it In Epglifh
as perfe&ly as he was ableâwhich he pro
ceeded to do. It was the communication of
a citizen Mitchell, v who states, that there had
been enrolled by an English agent, 'n the
| Western country, iooo.perfons, for the pur
i pose of attacking certain Spanish ports, and
. to go against Louifrana and the two Flori
t das; that Chifholm had a lift qf ijoo toÂ«e8
: who were engaged to take up arms in favor
. of England, that there were formed on.th*
1 Lake 3 jco regular troops, 700 Canadian
I militia, and 200 savages, to at,tack Fort
. EouisJ.that ChiCjiolm bad provided fix piec
es of cannon, the fame which was procured
o for citizen Genet ; that the rendezvoup wes
s to be at Knoxville the id of July ; and
t that after Chifholm had reported the bufi
t ness te the British Minister, he would, si t
i_ out for England, to lay thÂ« projeft befo' e
the British government, and command mc
ney and vessels for carrying it into eiTecL
i- The Chevalier also gave.to the committee
I- a letter which Mitchell had received from
Chifholm. It was a requefj thÂ»t Mitchell
I, and Craig would be in TennefTee in July ;
r. with an assurance that they might rely upon
r _ every thing which )ie said.
The next papers were the evidence of
John Phillipd Ripley and Thomas Odiorn,
â  who were brought forward by the Chevr
lier de Yrujo.
J. P. Ripley states, that he is acjti'zen of
>. New Hampshire ; that he was educated with
Captain Eaton at Yale College ; that capt.
Eaton had told him, that several letters were
n found in the possession of Dr. Romayne,
1- which proved th? BritiGjunimfter to. b* cor -
e cerned in the enterprise contemplated by
Â», Gov. Blount; that these letters offered re
d wards to any person who would Â«ngag? in
the service, and thÂ«t thfy were discovered
jr' under some rubbifli ; that many ofDr. Ro
it inayne's papers were destroyed : that capt.
Eaton had told him that Col. Pickering had
e reprimanded him for. having mentioned any
if thing refp-;diug these letters, and had said
r, that Great Britain was now the only friend
1- we had ; that he saw a letter which capt.
r- Eaton had written to Col. Pickering on the
>- subject. On examination by the committee
1- Ripley asserted that he believed that Gneat
Britain was at the bottomof the conspiracy.
n Thomas Odiorn deposed, that he was also
d at College with capt. Eaton, and that capt.
it Eaton had told him nearly the fÂ»me circum-
II fiances which f. P. Ripley deposes to have
d heard from him, He alfio {fÂ»ys, he saw tfce
o letter which the captain had written to cpl.
> Pickering, as an apology for hayingmention
:â¢ ed any thing refpeding the letters found in
le pofftjfion of Dr. Romayne.
it Next follows the evidence of William Ea
it ton, taken at Springfield before Judge Ly
man. He states that Philips Ripley wan
n hiscotemporary at college, and that he had
e (ince been acquainted with him at Philadel
â¢s phia ; but that he does not khow much a
bout Odiorn. Some time after his return
d from New York, he recollects to have told
s- Ripley that four or five original Tetters of
,:1 Win. Blount were found in Dr. Romayne's
f , possession, at the discovery of one of whicU
he seemed a good deal ernbarraffed. The
>- deponent also told the said Ripley that Mr.
r, Pickering was with him forhav
-- ing mentioned any tiling about these letters,
ic until the matter was laid before the com,
mittee ; but the deponent denies that he e
it ver told Ripley, or that Mr. Pickering ever
fs said to him, " that Great Britain was now
11 the only friend we bad." The deponent
le believes he might have given it as his opin
ion, that the British minister would have en
couraged the plan, if it had been feafibk ;
ic that he had delivered every article refpe&ing
)f the conspiracy of Mr. Blount which had
>e come into his hands to the committee of en.
sr. quiry.'Captain E.iton also fpokeof a French
. engineer having b'een into ali the fra ports<>(
it the United States, in order to make jÂ»lans
I, of, and observations refpefting them.
;- The next paper wis a com man; cation fro ia
le the Chevalier de Yriijo, confiding of an ori
n ginal letter from General Clark of Georgia,
:e. to Murphy, Eiq- coaful oftiis catho
! lie majrily there, in aufwer (o an applica
le tionmade to him on thefubjefl of the coÂ»-
a fpiracy, in which he states Â« that the pecu
liar nature of the proposition made to him
le byjthe Brit-Mi, prevents him from givingthat
ic fatisfadion which is required ; an applica
tion, lie fays, had beeii made tohim through
1- a channel which bound hiru to silence ; he
;- was asked whether 10,000 dollars would in
ducc him to join the British, but that hehai
rejected the offer with disdain."
!e Mr.- Sitgreave said that all the documents.
1- wliich were of anyimportanee had now been
:c read ; what remained were not worth oca -
h pyiiig the tinii of the heufe toread themâIf it were wiA. 1, Ijcf-Vavfitjk tr.Sy might be
gone through.
The Speaker said, that WO-1H be deter
mined on a motion being made for printing.
Mr. Otis rl-.ovjd that the report and doc
uments he printed.
Mr. Davvfon said"there were two depofi
tiofis of James Carey, one before the cÃltt'ift
jndge, and another before the committee ;
as one only bad beec read, they did not
wholly agree, he trusted, that both would be
printed. ,
Mr. Sitgreaveij said, certainly all the pa
pers will be printed.
Mr. Dawfoa observed that Mr. Byers had
given evidence, which, though not on oath
he thought entitled to credit, and ought to
be printed, as it corroborated the evidence
of Carey.
Mr. Sitgreaves said, it had been usual
upon extraordinary and important oecafions
to order printed more copies of papers than
the usual number ; he thought this one of
those occafuns, and moved that 600 copies
might be printed, as he supposed the_ addi
tional expence would be inconsiderableâA
greed.
â !-â¢ The Speaker said a communication had
r been received from the commiflioners of the
finking fund, which was ordered
to be printed.
Mr. Nicholas said, it appeared to him,
that when an important objeft was to be ac
complifhed, and Tuch as the house could
form an opinion upon, it was proper to ex
pnefs their sense upon the fubjedt to the
committee app*L.ted tb consider it, left
they might aÂ£t from their own opinion, up
on a contrary bafia, and afterwards have
what they had done reversed by the House.
He thought this course r.eceffary with re
fpeft to the deferred debt.' He wished the
attention of the house to be now turned to
* thisobjeft, as it would be recol'.e&ed that
this fefiion would probably be the only op
portunity they would have of a fair and full
" difctiOiftd of it,- as the next feflion -will as
neceflity be a fliort one, and the following
one willbs too near the period at which re
sources will be wanted, to have the desired
efFeÂ£>. This was, therefore, the time for
making the proper provision, which was
absolutely necelTary, except they were to
incroach upon funds destined for other ob
jects. He, therefore, proposed to the house
aj-efolution to the following effedl :
" Resolved, That the Coipniittee of
Ways and Mfans be inftrufted to prepare
and report a plan for railing a sum which
(hall be equal to fatisfy the demands which
will be made upon thfc Government in the
year 1801, on account of the Deferred
Debt."
The Speaker was of opinion that it was
necessary, if not to move, at least to have
the proposed refolutian difcufled in commit
tee'of the whole. [He read the rule.]
Mr. Nicholas thought the rule had refer
ence to a fpecific Tax. He could refer to a
precedent vrhere the course recommended
by the Speaker was not taken. It was the
resolution requiring the Secretary of the
Treasury' to prepare and report a plan for
laying a Direst Tax.
Ttfe Speaker was doubtful whether the
resolution's proposing to inllruft the com
mittee of ways and means, took it out of
the rnle.
Mr. Coit hoped the resolution would lie
upon the table till to-morrew âAgreed.
Mr. Coit presented the petition of cer
tain inhabitants of Conne&icut, officers of
the DiftriÂ£i Court of the United States,
praying for an alteration in the time of hold
ing the said courts. Referred to a feleA
committee.
Mr. Williams prefentcd the petitiort of
Azar Bagley, a soldier in the lately war,
prayiflg for reflitution on account of a certi
ficate which had been received by means of a
forged power of Ittorney. Referred to the
committee of claims.
Mr. Harper, from the committee ap
pointed to ptepare and report a bill for the
relief of AntoniaCarmichael, reported a bill
which was twice read and ordered to be
committed to morrow.
Mr. Otis presented a petition from Isaac
Stevens, late a prisoner at Algiers, which
states the hardships the petitioner had expe
rienced ; that during his long absence from
family and home, his property had been
foade away with, his wife had been obliged
to go out to service, "and his children had
been dispersed, his own health impaired, and
that he was now obliged to fublift upon cha
rity ! He prays for some aid which may
soothe the decline of his life. . Referred to
the committee of commerce and manufac
tures.
Mr. W C Claiborne presented the petiti
on of James Grant, of Knoxville, dating,
that in pursuance ps a procefi issued by a
Committee of that House, he and his pa
pers were seized on the 28th of la ft July ;
that he was in custody 65 days, at the ex
piration of which, he was discharged, at the
distance of 700 miles from his own home,
from whence he had been dragged by mili
tary force, to the great negleS ofhisbufi
nef3. He prays to be placed, at least, in as
good a situation as he was found. He
reckons 20 days for his retHrn home, which
added to 65, make 85, and hopes he shall
be allowed Â»ve dollars a day: for, as he has
"been guilty of no offence, he trusts he (hall
pa unpuftiihedâReferred to the Committee
of Claimsj
' M r . ' Harper tailed for the order of the
day on the* report of the committee of claims
on the petition of Henry Hill, which was
agreed to, and the Heufe according went
into a committee of the whole on the fub
jeÂ£V, Mr. Dent ill the chair.
This fubjedt has been frequently before
the House, in different (hapes, and has oc
cupied much of its time. The petitioner,
Henry Hill; is ;the administrator of Mr.
Miller, the administrator of Mr. Banks,
whose name has often been before the
1 lonfe, paiticularly in the settlement of the
tlaim of the widow of General Greene.
It appears, from an investigation ot fafls,
that the United States, in their Recount
with John Ba'ika, Imj ft double credit for
the fame sum of 9768 cfolktrs/ it being cre
dited to them in the quarter-mailer's de
partment, and'allp deferred ouNof the bal
ance due to John Banks, on hi*) contraÂ£t
account; and,-irbeing nn established role
at the Treasury, not to open accounts for a
new settlement, which has once been ad
jured 'by the proper officers, the Treasury
Department have refufed to re-fettle this
account.âMr. Hill prays for this balance,
âThe Committee of Claims are of opinion
that it would be improper for them to deter
mine who are the a&ual of equitable repre
sentatives of John Banks, so far as refpetts
this balance; the right of the claimants, in
cafe of controversy, may receive a judicial
determination. It is fufficient that the bal
ance hi placed to the credit of the perfo'n to
whom it belonged on the 3 1 ft of Decembev
178J, when the* sum wa3 retained out of
Banks's payment; That Committee, there
fore, submit the following resolution to the
consideration of the House :
" Resolved, That the accoanting officers
of the Treasury caufethefumofg,76B,Bl-90
Dollars, charged to the confradt account of
John Banks, on the 31ft Day of December,
1783,10 be credited to the said John Banks;
and* that the sum so credited, to the account
of fucfi other person as, in their opinion,
(hall be ju'ftly chatgeable therewith."
Mr. Harper,' Mr, Foster and Mr. Find
ley urged an agreement to this refolntiou.
Mr. Coit proposed to amend it, by adding
a clause of the following effedl: "And that
they charge the account of the said John
Banks with the money paid by the United
States to the executors of General Greene,
on acuount of the debts of the said John
Banks, or John Banks and Co. bailed and
secured by the said General Greene."
After considerable discussion, Mr. Otis
moved that the committee rife, in order to
have the fubjeft re-committed,- that farther
fa&s may be stated. This motion produ
ced also considerable debattj, a detail of
which we suppose would be uriinterefting to
our readers. At length the iommittec
rose, and being refufed leava to ,fit again, a
motion was made to recommit the report to
the'committee of claims'; when Mr. Otis
moved an inftruÂ£ti<tn to the committee to
the following effefk: " to report a statement
of faftÂ» relative to the demand which the U
nited States may hive upon the balance in
question, on account of indemnifying ths
estate of Gen, Greene, as surety for the
said Banks."
This inftru&ion to the committee, after
some debate, was agreed to.
Adjourned.

FROM A LONDON PAPER.
THE COMET.
(Lalinde âJournal de.Faris, Aug.i6.)
The comet discovered August 14, by
citizen Bouvard is rapidly removing from r>
the earth. It is now in the arm of Her
cules, and in a few days will be hardly vifi- N
ble.
ExtraS of a letter from Mr. Capel Loft, dat- 1
cd Frojlon, in Suffolk, Aug. 26. c
" The comet i 3 still difcernable. At b
eight hours, 53 minutes this night it was a- C
bove a Ophinchi, with 4 deg. greater altitude
than that star ; the comet being 50 deg. 5 Â®
min. It had 73 deg. polar distance, and j.
was very near an unnamed star, from which
it was palling S, E. Its right ascension 20 tc
> deg. of Sagitarius. F
. " Though a comet might be fatal, and
perhaps one time will (a cornet may have
caused the deluge, and may cause the final n
r conflagration) there seems reason to believe
that generally they pass too far from us to 1
â¢ have any feniible effeft : and when they
have any, it is probably beneficial. I fuf- r ;
1 ' peÂ£l (but this is my private apprehenlion, i
and of no authority) that the prefeut com
et has been very near the earth's place in r:
the orbit, and that it is of no inconsiderable if
magnitude. It seems manifeft that comet w
might affeft both our atmofphtre and our
[ tides. c:
â  ! "At present I have no more to add, than "
that it dcÂ»s not seem to be any comet, the ir
return of whijth has been prediAed. Tha
of 1680 had its period computed 5 75 years
I Â« ' .
that of 1661 had lire eg evidence for a pc
j noj afiljrrteJ from the .iieory and otafcfVa-
I tion of 129 years, and perhaps passed
; iervei, in the loUthera hemiiphere j that ( t
1602 seems to have returned in j rfrtd
I do not find any ct?met, in the talks, tl,---
lements of which appear nitich tocorreipnul't
. with what has bfenhithtfttc aborted
"If it fl.all lie seen to pass the Eslfplic,
or b? re-confpictious after fâ,
a .time, s will have a better fiji-i
port Linfty of judging of it. I have <lO cLun
to that title ; but am metely an obferfrer of
nrture.and a revercr of those wonders which
1 fee, and of that infinity of Wonders which
is beyond the fight and imagination of crea- 1
ted beings.
" The path of the comet feerris to lie in
-such a direction, that if it is seen to
tne Ecliptic, go over a portjoi' i
the tn'lly <uiny. There, according to its p,
sent appearance, it tnuft (for a time at It;. ' 1
become invisible. It is with great difficul
ty to be seen now with a telescope which
has much light.
" Allow me to remark, that this iriftatJctf
proves how desirable it would be that those
who have the advantage of the flrft discove
ry could immediately eommimieate it for'
the benefit of the science, and for the gratis
ficat.on of a laudable, and, X hope, increas
ing cyrioilty in the public."
Another letter, dated Augufl 2y (
" Sir, since I wrote to you, there has'
been no opportunity of observing the com-r
et ; Indeed if there hsd, I fear it is no long
er vVithin re ch of telescopes from this planet,
"In looking into Hevelius and Halley,
I think I have found reason for a conjecture,
which I submit with great doubt and de
ference to the judgment of ailronomersâ>â¢
that probably this comet, which at its hi t
obfervatioa was either retrogade or station
ary, with refpeft to the equator (as is the
cafe with comets in returning from' the fun
when the earth lies between then/ and 11> 1
fun), and had ndvanced little in polar di:'
ance, probably came lo its perihelion aboi'
the end of June, wften invisible to to us
this time of the year, being then among Â»
constellations of the font hern hemifplu . ;
I and that it passed itÂ» afccndiag rrodc, i:i nr."-
thÂ» end of Gemini, Ibme few days before
was observed, and was, when firit difepver.':,
crofling a part of the earth's orbit, nd h "
passed codiderably near the earth' place â 
| during which part of its prog'refs it "v. :
bright, and its apparent diameter confid-. ra.
ble ; that its perihelion probably lies v.
in about 8-tenthi of the earth's diltance from
the fun ; and that perhaps our pofteritv
may again fee it, at an Kra of remoteness,
indeed hopeless to the present race, when .
compared with the duration of human life ;
iince if these suppositions be well founded, it
will be no other than the comet of. 165;,
described and delienated by Hevelius."
The Ladies must beware of mingling in
politics, if they woald retain any pretend
ons to be treated with that politeness which
I Chivalry once inspired,âTake the decifioit
of a gallant Parisian Cafuifl on this import
ant question :
" In the ancient Chivalry the refpedl fur
the fair sex was carried even to adoration,
nor even then was it carried too far. It is
known, however, that when a lady ceafeil
to place herfelf under the protection of war, -
tiers, in order to become a champion her
felf, the brave Knights did not push their
complaisance so far as to allow themselves tfy
be killed by fair hand. They enftred
the lifts and encountered her with all the
grace and civility imaginable.
" Let us follow their example. Let in
not mingle in our*political quarrels thofs
Ladies whose claims belong to all parties.
But why should we refpeit the political vi
ragos, the Orleanift intriguers, if ft hey df>
not refpecl themselves ? Let uÂ« talk of Ma
dame Lillien as a pretty woman; with.this
fhc could not be offended. Let us speak
of Madame de Stael as Marat; if she thicii
; it worth while she will amend; if (he doer,
J not, file will add this feature to the other
| points of resemblance which she bears h:-r
, patron. A v.oman who hascompofed ihn -
j fÂ°dies on the influence of the pafilons, fhqnM
; calculate the passion which malt be inflamed
j against her by a ftranger(Ben. Constant,)
who has come among us to shake the tot
of difpord in a family already too murh di
vided."
