A DEVELOPEMENf OF THE CAt/SES OF THE
DISTURBANC'ES BETWEEN THE AMERI
CAN AND FRENCH REPUBLICS.
Addrtj[le4 to the Citizem of America.
my fellow-citizens,
WHEN the letter from Mr. jtfferfon to
Mazzei was written, is not precisely afcer
tainetl, nor 13 it material in the present en
qtiiry to be, known. That it was written
after the idea prevailed of the diffrrance of
sentiment between the people and govern
ment of this country ; and that it is calcu
lated to confirm that idea in Franee, every
sentence of the letter itfelf proves; and there
fore is the impropriety of it -fufficiently as
certained, at whatever period it may have
|ieen written. It is suggested, however, by
some of Mr. Jefferfon's most intimate ac
quaintances and best friends (who' I have
heard admit that he wrote it) that it was
written while he was secretary of state. To
this extreme impropriety of official conduft,
I will now add an article of information j
(which I have jufl received from a quarter
that cannot be doubted) that will confirm,
in a great measure, the important part which
such letters and such conduft have afted in
producing our present situation with France.
Soon after the successor of Mr. JefFerfon
retired from the office of state, and while
the cause of his retirement was the prevail
ing tope of the day, a person, then high in
office in Virginia, and now enjoying one of
the most important appointments undef the
government of the United States, was heard
to fay, "that he" (Mr. Randolph) "never
was in the confidence of," what he was
pleased to stile, "the republican party," to
. which it is well known that person always
profefled to belong, as a proof of which, he
aflerted, that but few of the friends of
France had trusted their letters to that coun
try through the office of ftate,the rejtg
naticn of Mr. JeJferfon, .but had sent them
immediately through the hands of the minis
ter of France âthat very minister, too,
who had thns infamoutly andfalfely pretend
ed a criminal intimacy even with that secre
tary, who his party thus profefled themselves
afraid to trust with their secrets against the
government of their country. This faft, my
fellow citizens, (which I conceive an im
portant one in the developement of the cau
ses of our present situation, as it opens a view
not only to the secret, the mysterious, and
very improper conduft of some of our coun
trymen, but throws a light upon the means
which have been employed by thenr, in cpn
junftion with the French, to destroy those
who stood in the way of their secret pro
jt A .Â«) I flatter myfelf I shall be able to
pifuve to your fulleft fatisfa&ion, if disputed;
and, therefore, shall now draw the conclu
sion, which naturally rcfults from such pre
mises as the letter juit examined into, and
the corroborating testimony of one of the
party, who has thus turned state's evidence
against bis own friends.
It is to be observed, that the confeffion
thus made of the " fear tf the party to
trust their letters through the department of
state," after the faithful, the trusty, and
the devoted friend of France, had left it, was
long before the letter of Mazzei was seen,
or such an accidental disclosure of the con
tents of their letters was expefted to be
made. The confeffion was then a thing tip
on which no precise charge could be fixed,
as it was not known what those letters " they
were afraid tÂ« trust through the department
of state" contained. But having now seen
a letter from the officer of thjt department
himfelf, who thty were witling to truji, and
comparing the contents of that letter, with
the confeffion thus made, what are the con
clusions natural to be drawn ? That there
were letters written indeed, whicji were im
proper to be conveyed through the hands of
our government, and which, therefore, could
not be entrusted to that conveyance, after
thole had departed from office, who were
not only sensible of their impropriety, but
were equally interested with the authors
themselves, in keeping the contents of such
improper letters secret !
The letter just examined into, certainly
warrants that or any other conclusion that
can poflibly be drawn. There is not only
every thing improper in it, that can arise
from the consideration of its being written
by one who was assisting, in an eminet de
gree, in administering which
tha letter itfelf- holds up as infamous ; not
only the cleared proofs to be obtained from
it, of those misrepresentations of the princi
ples of our government, and the sentiments
of the people towards it, which were calcu
lated to bring upon us our misunderstandings
with France ; but the most fatisfaftory con
firmation that th4re were many other letters
of the famg. defeription, or perhaps worse,
written immediately to France, which have
not yet come to light in this country.
My God!â And is this the mighty friend
to the people, who is thus accusing them of be
ing the advocates of principles which they
dare not promote in the appo ntment of their
officer} ?âThis the friend to American in
dependence, who is thus fecret'y courting a fo
reign power to controul us ? This the im
mciculate head of repullicanifm in the great and
flouriihing empire of America, and the ene
my to an Anglo-monarchico-ariftocratic in
fluence, who has thus travelled to the court
of the Grand Duie of Tufcany, of all other
places upon earth, to hunt out a proper con
fident to deposit his secret platfs for the pro
motion of those principles of repubKcanifm
with \ This the hero who prefers the tem
pjluous fca of lilerty to the calm of defpetifm,
and tajiisfo boldly of the timid men f Lut where
he supposed it would never be heard of by them)
who is now afraid to fay whether he is au
thor of that pretty littlt epijllt to Mazzei or
not 'f'uls the virtuous aceufer of the officers
of our government, who, while an officer
himfelf, made.,that office with which he was
entrusted, th> acknowledged channel thro'
which information was sent to our enemy,
that was improper to be conveyed through
the fame channel after he had left it ! ! !
At a time when France was endeavoring j
to dillrad-l and divide all Europe ; t a set
one nation up to destroy another ; to stir up
the people of all nations to uppofe their own
governments ; in fliort, when, (he had (hewn
an evident willingness to promote her own
views, at the expence of all the world be
lides, and for that noiale purpose, had em
ployed intriguing emifTaries in every quar
ter of the globe, where any advantage could
be gained in that wayâWas it right for a
ny of the departments of those governments,
thus intrigued upon, to be made the imme
diate channel through which those wicked
ai}d deftruftive project were to be promoted
against themselves ?
From the commencement of the French
revolution to the present flage of it, through
every step, and by all parties, these were the
constant and avowed principles upon which
they afted. Even while Hie king lived, and
their pretcnfwns were confined to a limited
monarchy, they had views of diffracting and
disturbing Europe. Neckar in defence of
the king, de Lefiarts, who was minister for
foreign affairs, and their miniller at Vienna
when the war broke Out, all (hew, that the
disposition of the emperor, of Prussia and
Austria, were pacific , and that they were
all forced into the war by the system of
France. And.Briffot, in accusing the king
in the convention of want of fidelity to the
nation, confirms the fame thing.
After the king's death, we have the I
ftrorigeft proofs from the heads of both par
ties, of the continuance avid enlargement of
the fame plan. BrifTot declares in one of
his letters, that for the French to succeed
in their revolution, it was necessary " they
should fetfire to the four corners ofEurope."
Oniillr Dtfmoulins, in answer to BrifTot,
in support of the party of the Robefperians,
though violently opposed to BrifTot in every
thing else, agrees with him in the fame par
ticular. "To disorganize Europe," fays
the Robefperian, " was one of the sublime
vocations of the convention," v Their ac
tions have always eorrefponded with their
profeffions ; and the most arful and infidu
ous means hare ever been employed to en
furethem fuccets in those atrocious projedts.
At the very time ?vhen this was their plan
at home, and preparations were making for
its execution throughout Europe, they car
ried their deception, which was a principal
part of their system, so far, as to assure the
Emperor, that they abhorred the idea of
exciting commotions and diffentions among
nations. And even when they had laid one
of the most abominable schemes, which be
longed to the whole system, to destroy Eng
land, they carried their diffimuUtion so far,
as to folieit the interposition of that nation
to bring about a peace with Prussia and the
Emperor. The scheme was this ; to estab
lish a popular government in Holland, there
by to place their forces under their com
mand, destroy their trade, and, to use the
words of'one of the members* of their own
convention, "to place their a/Jignftts on the
very defksoflheir counting-houses, there to
ruin the bank of England, and bring about
a revolution in the whole money system of
Europe, &c."
To effedt this, and at the fame time to
break the maritime power of that nation,
which fteod sb much in - the way of their
wicked proje&s of " felting Jirr to and disor
ganizing all Europe," it was necessary that
the United States of America, like those of
Batavia, should be engaged in their service.
Accordingly, Genet come here charged
with inftruftions to use every means in his
power to bring about a commercial treaty
with this country, which evidently was in
tended to have that effeft ; who, Agreeably
to deceptions praftifed oa several of the
European nations to complete their plan,
used every artifice in his power, and not en
tirely without success, to kindle here a little
of thcdiforganizingbhze with which they
had " set fire to the four corners of Europe,"
and thereby place us tof> under their controul.
"Genet, although he had aftually distribu
ted French commissions in Charleftou, and
had. endeavoured to engage the people of
southern parts of America in the immediate
service of France, when at Phila
delphia, had the wretched lesion of hypo
crisy and (with which their whole
fyftetn abounded) so well by heart, as to in
duce us to believe that France did not wilh
us to join her in the*war. Nevertheless, it
appears there were those in America who
underftoochhim from the firft, and were apt
scholars, in those compounds lessons of French
politics, so necessary for the completion of
their p'aÂ». That there ever was, and still
is, a part/ in America, who wilhed her to
come into this grand disorganizing scheme
for the aggrandizement of France, while
they assume to themselves the credit of being
her only patriots, there is no fort of doubt.
And that a coalition, so important to France
as the one proposed with America, for the
completion of this grand deftroyingplan, was
to be relinquilhed when (he saw a party for
it in this cour.try, was not to have been ex
pedled. Wljat she had failed in aecomplifh
ing by treaty} through Genet, (he soon per
ceived the means of bringing jbout by a di
vision among eurfelW? ; and to this the au
thority of our own citizens, that we were
already a divided popple, gave decided
weight. It is the last expedient which has
* Sec Chcflard'slpcech, nude and approved of
in the C&ivention, in which this whole scheme is
explained.^
t 1 he letter from the Vice-President to Mazzci
now explains to \is fully what Genet rreast in his
reply to his letter to Governeur Morri-, when he
infilluates thatjthe Secretary had exprefled very iHffer
ent fciitiments in that letter, from what he had al
ways done to him ill private. The letter so Mazzei,
;t is to be remembered, is one of his private
munications ; therefore, agreeable to bis friend Ge
net, we have no riirht to expedt tu ftnd it qonfiltent
with his pvM:c aci*s!
brought their plan so far on in the part of it
which related (;> Holland.
To hriiig about that popular government
in that deluded country, which was\t(> place
their forces under the command of France,
and ruin the bank of England, the means
which were employed arc very striking, and
serve as a ftroiig evidence of the principle by
which theyhaVe been governed in their con
duit towards us. A fter they had driven off
the Stadtholder, and overturned their gov
ernment, under the pretence of giving them
a free one, a convention war, called for the
purpose of farming a constitution, a great
majority i>f which v.'erc in favor of a ' federal
republic. The minority, who were for a
still more loose and pl-odigate system, becaQfe
like all men of that description, extremely
noisy, and formed a fadtion for the purpose
of connterafting the will of the majority
The French, with whqfe schemes of 'disor
ganization the eftabliffiment of a regular and ,
firm government did not very well accord, !
were ready at once to seize upon the diffa-
of those fadtious few, to bring a
bout a system more consonant with that spi
rit of disorder, which was the ground work :
of their plan. Accordingly, two deputies
from the fadtion (Van Vreede and Hoofe)
were dispatched to Paris, to obtajn the in
terference of France. France did interfere,
and the majority were compelled to yield.âi
Had the majority, thus treated, been in a
situation to refill, the conference, there is
no doubt, would have been war.
The coalition of America, which came
next in their maritime system, that was to
Europe in its governments and
banks, when seen through and rejedtcd,
did not, as I have already observed, increase
their affeftions for us ; but on the contrary,
determined them, as in the cafe of Holland,
to force us into the plan. In this they
were encouraged, in tj>.e fame way that thtey
had been theW, by a party which they saw
in America, ready to call in the pretended
principles of their cause to aid in the de
ftruftion of our government ; but the geo
graphical difference of situation between this
country and theUnite<J Provinces with refpeft
to France, rendered a different course of co
ercion necessary from what had bA:n prac
tised there. What they had beep able to
effedt in those neighbouring countries im
mediately by the menaces of their armies,
which had been let in from Belgium by the
affiftanee of the ice, they could only at- â¢
tempt in America (remote and separate
from them as (he was by the sea) through
the medium of her trade. They accord
ingly attempted, through that vulnerable
part, our interejl, to overturn that system
os-policy which they found (o much in the
way of their abominable and felfifh plan ;
hoping thereby, through the willingness of
a part, which they already saw among us,
to come into any scheme that would destroy
our government, and the dispositions of the
reft to avoid war, to subdue us to-their
schemes. I
Situated as America and France were,
this was the most effedtualânay, the only
possible means that France could have devis
ed, to make us subservient to her will, and
ensure our afting as her tools in the subju
gation of other powers, when (he had fail
ed in the double plans of enlijlment and nego
tiation laid in thfe million of Genet. France,
it is to he observed, when (lie began her
depredations on our trade, was engaged in
the most troublesome part of the war. The
combined powers all then engaged against
her ; convulsed by her own different parties
within ; her navy low, and her means for
railing it more so ; (lie had little chance to
compel any nation, where (he could not
march her armies by land, to fall into her
schemes, other than by affedting their inte
rest in whatever way (he could.
America, though separated from her by
the sea, which (he was not situated to pass
in ftich numbers as would endanger our in
dependence, while the naval power of
Great Britain remained entire against her,
was, nevertheless, (he saw, extremely vul
nerable in her commercial* relations with
that power. Just emerged from a state of
slavery ; the private fortunes of her citieens
red 'ced by the long ftagoation of the dif
ferent branches of industry ; and incum
bered with a cnnfiderable public debt, in
curred in supporting the war which had set
her free ; all her efforts were naturally bent,
at the time when the French revolution be
gun, to that single objedt of bettering her
condition, by extending her trade ; there
by encouraging her citizens to the acquire
ment of individual wealth, the sure means
of national prosperity, credit and strength.
Great Britain, the mother country, from
whom (he had just emancipated herfelf;
with whom alone, almost, (he had formerly
traded ; whole language was similar ; whose
wants, from a long and habitual intercourse,
had become reciprocal; and above all,
whose enterpriling disposition had given her
a commercial afcenddncy in all the four
quarters of the world ; it was natural (liould
gain her principal intercourse in that way.
It was that intercourse which was to increase
the wealth, the power and the consequence
of any nation (except, herfelf ) but particu
larly of Great Britain, that France dread
ed, and in her feeret ambition.most heartily
envied. Any thing, therefore, which would
disturb and injure Â«ur trade, which she saw
mull, from a thousand combining circum
stances, be conaefted with, and tend to
the aggrandizertient of that nation, it was
easy to be perceived, would both oppress
the one, and bring the other to co-Â«perate
with her in the scheme of " banlruptcy,"
which was to produce their final ruin.
To this scheme the conduct of some of
our own citizens, at home, bore a .perfect
correspondence. It was that commercial
connection with Great Britain, it seems,
that blind prejudice against that nation in
opposition to our own irrtereft, which fills
up a considerable part of those mfreprefen
taiions of the fentimeots of
the people of this country, which firft led
France to aft against us. " Britifn mer
chants and those trading an Britifb capitals"
we find, clpfe the catalogue of that t,.n.
temptihle feis}, who, it is represented to
France, ave opposed to all tfcfe " landhoM
ers and all that mighty mass of men of ta
lents," who have loosed themfelres from
their Lilliputian ties in gratitude to her.
And while tliofe rtiifreprefentations were
thus inviting FraAce into a war against tfur
commerce* that war, certainly,Â°was best '
calculated, of all others, to make tools of
us to that nation. The government of
America, being a popular government, those
who mifreprefatttd the fuitiments of the peo
ple towards that government, to France,
well knew tbemfelves, that to engage Ame
rica in her feryice, it was firft necessary, in
fact, to change the sentiments of the pwpleâ
and that was to be no way more effedtually
done, than by firft (tabbing their intereftj
and then convincing them that that injury
had been done them by the impoYicy and â¢
wickedness of their ruled. Tin's co-operati
on with the Frendg'fcheme we have seen
for several years in tjfs country.
Thus, my oilr trade ha*
been destroyed, our HiWrefts injured, and
our government censured, to make us over
turn that government, and place ourselves
in the fraternal, or rather infernal, grip of
France.

CADIZ, July II."
During three nights we have seen only
bombs fall on the town. Our cbaloupes and
small armed vessels -having advanced, have
prevented the enemy from reaching the
town. We receive affifiance of those vessels
from Seville and Carthagena, and we shall
soon have iqo. The most cautious mea
sures are taken for the fake of fafety.
At Cadiz the magazines below the walls,
which are bomb proof, have been converted
into places of refuge for the inhabitants.â
Death and immediate execution have been
proclaimed against whoever fhali commit
robbery. The town has offered 50,000
piastres, ar.d the merchants 100,000 as a re
ward to those seamen who shall att gallantly.
General Maffaredo has promifrd a thousand
piastres to the crew who shall take or fink a
British chaloupe.
The squadron is preparing to be in readi
aefs to go tQ sea. General Maffaredo has
informed the commanders of vessels, that as
soon as they shall have cleared the bay, he
will make the signal for forming the line,
which if any {hip disobeys, instantly the
commander lhall be arretted, and the second
in command /hall take charge of the (hip ;
if he {hall fail, the third, and so on.
The court has returned an anfwerby the
firft courier from general Maffaredo, and has
authorised him to aft according to circum
stances, with permifSbn to him to take in
Cadi* what money he wants, from the sums
offered by the merchants to the king. We
are assured, that the Spanish failot3 appear
to be much animated, two batteries being
now flnifted "and armed, and tartanes Being
prepared with 36 pouudbrs and furnaces for
red-hot balls. These precautions and means
of defence make us easy refpect;ng the at
tack' of the British.
From a Paris Paper of Augujl 5.
New addreflcs have been j>ubli(hed from
the arm) of Italy, which {hew with' what
dreadful fuccefu the minds of ail troops hate
been tampered with, against the Legislative
Body. It appear? clearly to day in he fol
lowing address froyi the diviiion of* General
Joubert:
" Royalifm raises his audacious head
and multiplies Murders in the Departments.
" Priesthood rafcinates the eyes; heats the
! heads, Sharpens the poniards. The execu
; tion of a plan combined for the re-e!tablifh
; mentoftiie Throne is openly followed jn the
| Legislature. One Liberticide law is fierce
ly passed when another is propbfed : The
Directory, who are entrusted with the "care
of our coriftitution, accepted by our ar

; are accused without decency. â¢ Charges arered agaiiiA yhe Civ!f;n wko ha 3 reri

irVrtrefts, in order to crown the labours o

friends of the government.

in their ft eeches ; riie cries of deathâth'
dreadful bowlings of the Journalists of Louij
XVIII. and you will have the mournfd
pidtjire of the riling counteS-re volutions.
" What ! comrades, flia.ll we have fhec
much blood for the prosperity tfnd glor]
of our country, and yet fee it/again replun
ged into the disorders of anarchyâinto th(
fury of civil wars. Shall the odious Capet.
who for fix years has carried his disgrace
from state to state, condantly driven before
our republican phalanxes,reduce us under the
yoke ? If this idea be disgusting to every
citizen who has hut once in his life been fti
mulatid love of his country, how
much more so mull it be to the old soldiers
of the republic,
" Volunteers of the army of the Interior,
the fame men whom you so often repulsed
on the B:Â«i)ks of the Rhine âwhom you so
completeljjhumbled at Quiberon, are now
at Paris, and in the Departments ; they

MAKE A RAMPART OF YOUR BCvIEB
around the Coaditution, which you ha/e
sworn to maintain : and rely'upon
in the full conviction that (he never will fir
fake the republican colours."
In the address from gen. Serrurier's di
vision, the following passage is remarkable :
" Speak, Citizens Dlredtors, speak, and
instantly the mifenante who polluteihe foil
of the republic fhnll cease to ex id. Tojn
iiihilate them, it will doubtless 'be fuffici
ent to detach some of our brave brethren
in the armies of the Rhine and Moselle,
and of the Sambrp and Meufe ; it is ourde
fign to partake with them the honor of pur
ging France of her moll cruel enemies."
LONDON, July 16.
The lad Dublin papers announce, that on
Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, Ro
bert Thorntoii, F.fq. chief clerk of the house
of commons, put an end to his exiftcnce,
with a pistol, at his apartment in North
Earl-street, Dublin. No motive can be
conjectured for this raflj and melancholy ca
tastrophe. Mr. Thornton liai spent the lad
week on a visit with his friend and official
Secretary Cooke, at his
house in park, and usually carats
into town once a day ; he had breakfafted
the morning before with Mr. Secretary Pel
ham. He bad declared his intention of go.
England in a day or two ; and for a
fortnight past complained of a flight illness,
but nevertheless was apparently in good
health and spirits.
About five o'clock on the fatal evening,
he ordered his-horfe to be saddled, which
was accordingly done ; but his two servants,
on account of his state of mind, did not
choose to go into his room, but waited to be
called. A great ipace of time having elap
sed, and no appearance of his stirring, they
became alarmed, and agreed to go up (lairs
together. On opening the door they found
him lying on his face, and the whole floor
covered with blood. He had put the muz
zle of the pistol close to his head, at the
right fide, rather beyond the ear, and a com
plete division of the skull took place by the
explosion. His brains were scattered about.
The fight (hocking. It was not
without difficulty that the mangled head
could be reilored to its proper position, in
order that his person might be indentified
before the coroner's jury. Another pistol
lay- on the floor by his fide, and which he
mt'ft have had in his hand when he perpe
trated the rash deed. No one in the house
heard the pistol fire.
An inquefh was immediately -heldâvet
didt Lunacy. He had about his person be
tween eighty and ninety pounds in gold,
and bank and accountable receipts in his
apartments to the amount of sixteen hun
dred pounds, lodgments for which it ap
peared he had made in the course of two
years past. Mr. Sheriff Lindfay, we hear,
took poflWlion of his property in order to its
being legally difp'ofed of.
Mr. Thornton, whose death is reported
in the lafl Irish papers, was a graridfon of
the last duke of Rutland but one, who had
a very large family by a lady with whom he
cohabitbd for several years, and who con
tinued to v live with him to the time of h'ia
death.

We are assured that he will form a camp un

a some remarks on Jervis's attempt on Cadiz, '
which (hew his supreme ignorance of the
1, laws of war. It is idle to inveigh against \
ft pradtifes fandtioned by the usage of ages. *
d Philanthropy reprobates war not merely in '
its details, but altogether ; and in the burn- '
5. ing of a town ev"en of an enemy, the hu- '
1- mane mind is wrung with anguish and pity ,
e at the miseries of the wretched fufferers.
d Every body knows that the commissions of
naval commanders, runâ" to take, burn, J
V fink and destroy," and that this is common
to all nations. Whatever policy didtates,
1 it is generally in vain to decry. The inhu
manity of the pradtice is indifputahle ; but
n our indignation (hould revert to t-hc cause of
2 such calamities on the human raceâto the
French âthe authors of t!)is horrid, mod '
- unprincipled, piratical treacherous war,
that ever blackened of a state
pretending to civilization. As to the
Spaniards, let Jacobins pity them :âtheir
sterile and cowardly pity is all they deserve.
, Their treachery in fir ft deferring a deferring
ally who has always facrificed he'rfelf to
them, and afterwards turning their arms
againd her, will deservedly fubjedl them to s
1 the ftvfiri'fctiaftlfcment which an indign;
people can' inflidt. But the peculiar c

fimilar footing with other ports belonging
_ to Europsan powers. Tfteirplanis extensive,
, has been long in agitation, and is well di
j gefted.
. Captain Rogers has no .doubt of the abote
? intelligence, for he conversed with several

fuppotcd that the lands offered for faleon those fa
bricated titles, are at least worth fifty thoufjind
dollars. Sufh as we have actual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and Iz, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the adual property of William
Dcllw)Q, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumonf, now of Paris, and James A venll
and others, bl this State. There is*fome grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indlvi
duafs, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
1 a shopkeeper of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view the wkkfdncfs of those men, which when
tbe public have perused, will induce them to ex
cuse the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July Â»Bth, 17)7.
1 Thomas Kelly, of the Cpunty of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William ,T Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others; and further the laid Joseph
and Trumaa did perfttade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the icth day
of November, 1793, or set back t,wo years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
s Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious name-,
there being;no such perlou there, To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.

On t44 19th July, 179-7, cameperfonally before

On the lÃlh July, 1797, came before me Jacob
Kibby, a person by me well kt:own and worthy of

two of the parties abovementioncd did make ap
plication to him this deponent, some time in the
winter of 1796, to make them a deed for two thou
sand acres of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a share of the profits, on tha
sale of said lands, for his so doing and th t they
made application several times for the fame purpo e,
which fervicas this deponent as often refufed, de
claring to them that he had no right to lands, and
coulddo uo such thing ; which daring attempt 011

potentiary of his Britannic Nlajefty, General Agent
for atftlUng Brilifh creditors, and such particular ar
gent* as they may fpetially authorize, in prosecuting
their claims before the cwmmiflioners for carrying in
to efFett the sixth article ol the Treaty ofAmity, Com
vurct and Navigation between this Britannic Maje/ly and
the United States of America, hereby gives notice that
he has opened hÂ»s office at his house the south east
corner of Chefnut and fifth ftreeti, Philadelphia,
where he is ready to receive all ciaims or inttru&ions
for claims with the vouchers aud documents thereof,
for the purpoie 0i bringing forwatd the fame agree
ably so the rules and outers which the boaid may
think proper to prescribe.
And as it will be for the interest of all coueerned,
that the several claims be so (fated, and support
ed, as to prevent the delay which would ariie from
the necelfity of obtaining further information, of ad
ditional materials,from per(oÂ«s residing at a distance,
the general agent rhinks.it his duty to add, (for tbe
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the profccution of
their claims to his charge and management] that all
such claims ought in particular to set forthâ
iff. The proper description and (itoation df the
oreditor or claimant, vnd original debtor, refpeft
ively.
2d. The date andoature of the original contractor
debt.
3d. When, in what warmer, and to what extent,
the creditor or claimant w<s prevented or impeded,
by the provision, operation or deleft of law, the

cution, from recovfcring payment of the debt in
queftioiK t
4th The loss and damage incurred or sustained,
in consequence of such impediments, whether the
fame may have arisen from tbe infolveuey, change of
situation, or dearh of the debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from laple of tÂ»me, or othe/caufea impairing
the yalue and leeurity of the debt, which would not
have so operated if such impediments had notcxiAed.
And sth. The particular grounds and reasons on
which the claimant maintains, in tbe terms of the
treaty, that " by the ordinary course of judicial pro
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and a&ually
nave and receive full and adequate compensation* for
the lofifes and damages so fuiiaiued.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to fug
ged that the several claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regularly attefled', both as to ihe txiftence
of the debts claimed, and such other circumfhnces
as may be within their own knowledge refpcttively.
AÂ«id wherever the claimants in (fating the nature of
their evidence (which mull in every inlfance be the
belt of which the cafe r* capable) have occasion to
refer to the testimony of witnesses, it will be proper
to apprifcthe general agent of the names and placet
