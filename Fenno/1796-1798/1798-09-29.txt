NEW-YORK, Sept. 26.
Important News!
â At length the public expeftation receives
gratification on the interesting fubjefts of
European politics. Yesterday bythefhip
Fanny, -in 48 days from-Greenock, we
have received EngliJh papers to the 10th
of August. The firft thing that strikes
us, is what relates to Mr. GERRY.â
He received passports from the French
Government, on the 15th July, on the
delivery of which TALLEYRANF)
took occasion to fend liirn another long
insidious letter, in which he throws the
whole blame of the failure of the negoci
ation on the fcfincemy of the American
government. Every article of Furopean
intelligence breathes WAR, here, and
among the continental powers. Ire
land is reduced to tranquility, and pro
mife3, contrary to predictions abundant
harvefl..â--England remaias calm and
dignified in th* mirlft ef splendid fuccef
lts. rÃuonaparte in all probability is
initio h"ands of th: gallant Nelson.âThe
flame of war is lighting up its all devour
ing fires, and every where we fee omen-os
a general a:>ddredful conflagration. The
Auftrians have resolved to refufe assent
to the insolent and exorbitant demands
of the haughty and venal Direftory.â
â Sweden is muttering herforces and bright
ening her armour.âPrussia is no longer
pQrfuing a temporizing and short lighted
policy.â Russia has dispatched to the aid
of England one squadron, by the Baltic
and another by the Eurine, very oppor

PARIS, July 12.
Letter from the Minister of Foreign Rela
tions, to Mr. Gerry, Envoy from the
United States, enclosing him his passport.
As long, Sir, as I had roorfi to flatter
myfelf that I might fulfil the wifties of the
Executive Direftory, by endeavouring in
concert with y >u to re-eftabli(h the former
good unde-Handing between the French re
public and the United States, I exerted my
belt efforts both iu my conferences and in
my correfpnndence with you, to facilit&te
the means, to eftabli(h the basis, to enter on
the business, and to convince you of the util
ity with which your presence at Paris tnuft
be attended. It was in your charafter of
Envoy from the American government that
I received you, and that I wrote to you ;
it depended on yourfelf to be publicly re
ceived, and admitted by the Executive Di
reftory. Without cb-inciding in opinion
with you that any changes have been in
duced by the departure of Messrs. Pinckney
and Marshall in the full powers in which I
read that you were authorized to treat separ
ately, it appeased to me, that in the very hy
pcthefis in which you placed yourfelf, you
ought to refer the question to your govern
ment, and in the interval to fix with me, in
a calm and friendly difcuflion, upon all the
disputable points on which we differed.
This way of proceeding was the more na
tural, because without attending to the pre
mature information which your government
j| has abt inedofthe offer to treat with you
after tlis departure of your colleagues, my
note, of the :Bth Ventofe, March 18, which
mud have reached Philadelphia towards the
end of Floreal, left not a shadow of doubt on
tliis fnbjeft âit contains three objefts per
fectly diflinftâit begins by reftifying, with
the dignity that belongs to the French go
vernment, the ilatement of grievances made
by the United Slates, and drawn out by their
envoys in the inverted order of fafts the
preceding 28th Nivofe, Jan. 17, it next
points out the motives that prevented the
negociation being carried oh with the en
voys collcftively. Tt finally declares, in the
moll lolemn manner, conciliatory difpofi
' tions of the Executive Directory, and its
fermal desire of reuniting, between the two
countries, the lies of their ancient amity,
and the intention of treating with you.
Such an explicit declaration could not have
heen made but with the view of furnifhing
the President of the United States with in
fallible means of coming to an accommoda
tion. It was throwing down a pledge of
peace in order that it might be taken up.
I presumed to think that yon could not be
Jong without receiving analogous inttruc
tions, and even other powers, were they ne
cessary ; or, at least, that if yon had an
nounced to the President a desire of return
ing to America, fame other envoy would
rorae and accomplish the happy talk which
we (hould have had the fatisfaftion of pre
paring. To hopes, thus solidly founded,
there were added some observations on the
.aincon*eniencies that attended your depar
ture. I gave you to understand, that not
â¢withllanding your assurances to me, no one
would believe that it proceeded solely from
your own inclination, from a thorough con
viftion of the invalidity of yout powers, or
from a desire of feeing the business of the
-jiegociatiou entrusted to other bands. I ob
fcrved tÂ« you on the conjectures to which
it would give rife ; on the means it would
-furnifh to the British cabinet, that spares no
..pains in its endeavors to drive France and

the United States to eitren ties, from
winch it alone would derive advantages; 1
and even on the very fufpiaooi that it mutt I
call up inthe mindof 'Dvettiment. j 1
1 endeavored to make you fee into its potfible j
confequance : but a variety of circum
(lances occurred which have already retarded 1
the reccnciliation of the two republics ; it \
is but natural for him who feel- a sincere so- j
lituee for peace, to be under apprehrnfions
left new nbfticles should arise to retard it.
These considerations which I (hall ever re-
Colleft with prrde, induced me to oppose the ;
desire which you had expressed of quitting
France. But you peremptorily inflated upon
it in your letter of the 2zd iaft. The Di
reftory has eonfequently authorized me to
furnifh you with the paflports which you
have rt que (led for ponrfelf and for the vef
fei that awaits you at Havre. You have
them enclafed May your return to the U
nited States, and the cammunication of what
has passed between us, since you only have
rtfprefented your government, remove the
injurious opinion of hollile intentions on the
parts of France ! You have frequently af-i
fured me, that, if you could nit treat here as
envoy, your good offices (houldjnot be want
ingas a citizcnon yourreturn to the United
States. It were impossible for y4o to fender
: a more figna! service to the two countries
than bv contributing to make their political
and commercial relations accerd with their
inclination and their interest. " , J ffure your
government that the Executive Direftory
perseveres in the intention of loyally and sin
cerely endeavoring to reconcile the differ
ences that have arisen betweeen the French
Republic and the United States, as soon as
an opportunity Â»f so doing thall be sincerely
held cut, If it be really true that the dif
politions of your government are prepared to
co-operate, let them but.give a proof of it,
and you befere hand may aefwer for its suc
cess.
You cannot diiTerable, fir, tfiatif nothing hacl
prevented you from following up with me the
examination and the redrefling of the grievances
which divide the two Countries, we (hould nÂ»t
long (land in need of any thing but our respec
tive ratifications. Who cÂ»n entertain a donhl
of the fincerityof the French government, when
it (hall be known that fer nearly three months
every fpecific felicitation came from me, and
that in faithful compliance with the engage
ments I contracted ia my note of 28 Ventofe,
( March 18) was the firft seriously to press for
ward the business of the negociation after the
departure of Kefirs. Pinckney and Marshall
It will not, I trust, be said, that a refufd to
treat with them argued an unwillingneis tÂ«
come to a conciliation, whereas that refufal was
accompanied with a promise to treat with you,
and your full powers represented you as a per
son who was authnrifed to treat separately. To
that document Ikall I neceflarily appeal, because
it is the ba6s as the opinion which your govern
ment onght to have formed, and that even by
admitting you were tied down by secret reflric
tions, I could not in nay mind oppose what 1 do
not know from the trust due to your 1 ftenfible
authority.
Yes, Sir, when scarcely acquainted with
the departure of Messrs. Pinckney and Mar
(hal, I made it a point ia every conference
which I held with you from the moment,
to evince to you the urgency, the pr ipriety
and the possibility of an aftive negociation.
I laboured to reconcile them, and I was
about to tratifmit propofak to vÂ»a when a
packet from your government arrived at
Havie. Yon then seemed preparing to de
part. Till thfn I never had imagined that
you conceived the design of embarking till
we had come to an agreement upon the de
finitive articles to be ratified by your govern
ment. A few days after I reciered some
dispatches from Philadelphia, which for a
moment gave a new turn to my correspon
dence with you. Upon the 22d Prairial,
June 10. I notified to you that the difpofi
tibns of the Executive Dire&ory were the
fame, and I rrquelled you to inform me
whether you were in a Puliation to negoci
ate ? Upon the 30th Prairial, June 18, I
transmitted you a complete plan of negoci
ation. Upon the 9th Meffidor, June 27,
I sent you my firft note for discussion upon
one of the points of our treaties which are
not put in execution in the United States.
You declined to make any reply to it. It
is necessary, however, t3 be agreed upon
the details of a subject, in order to arrive at
any conclusionâUpon the 18th Meffidor,
July 6, I sent you two other notes. In vain
I accompanied these papers with the mod
cordial invitation rapidly to run over this se
ries of indispensable diicuffions upon all our
grounds of complaint. You never even
gave me an opportunity to prÂ»ve to you
with how much liberality the Direftwy
were disposed to aft in this matter. You
continued ortly to write for your pcrmiffion
to depart.âYet, it is the French Republic
or, which the blame is laid in the United
otat.es, of being avcrfe to peace ! Perfidious
instigators will infraate tmtt it has always
b<en averse to it. I (hall go back therefore
to the firft period, when symptoms of dis
content manifeft themselves, that is to fay,
on the arrival of the Minister Genet at Phi
ladelphia, in Prairial, ill year. A univer
sal joy appeared at the declarations which
be wag aathorifed to make. He then ex
pressed the amicable and generous exprellion
ot the French government, which, power
ful in the national energy, a'oftained from
reclaiming the aid of its allies, In a (liort
time some of its proceedings gave umbrage :
' they were the effe& of a zeai ill adapted to
circumstances, and unfortunately dill worse
â  interpreted. The President made nis com
plaints in France at the end as the fame
> year. The oommittee of public fafcty gave
1 immediate j and other aget tsar
-1 j rived at Philadelphia in the bfginnijig of
SATURDAY EVENING, SEP 1 EMBER 29, 1798.
Ventofe, year 2. Their inflruÂ£li>ns will 1
bear the utmost publicity. Not to ifiterfere 1
in any party affairs ; to refpeft the g.jvern- <
ment ; to prompt it to taawtaii its neutral- 1
vigor; to reprrfs aU armament* j
which might endanger it ; to maintain the
rights fectired to France by treaties. Such 1
is the fnbjecl of these inftruftions; such, t
further, were the inftruJlions given to the '
Minister Adet, who fncceeded these agents 1
in the year 3. Sorely nothing can be mÂ»re '
pacific. Neverthc ess the rights of France ;
are Mifenfibly affeftsd ; the most important i
clauses of her treaties art rendered inligni
ficant. Her (hips experience the most dif- 1
couraging vexations ; England sports with
impunity with the neutrality of the United
States, which becomes a source of great
lÂ°fs to France, which placed too much con
fidence in it- A tranfaclion v clandestinely
negociated, concludes with establishing to
the disadvantage of a power at amity with
the U. States, the of its most
implacable enemy. From that time for
ward there has been nothing between the
American government w'sich the represent
ations embarraft, and the .minister plenipo
tentiary of the French repbulic who Were
bound to make them, but a dorrtfpo dence
which has gradually rileo in point of aspe
rity. The French government has never
interfered. It has rested in the hope that
: the true interest of the United States would
lead them todifcover that Britain was draw
ing them into her vortex- Far from assum
ing a hollile attitude,.it affedled indifference,
in order to be patient confidently with dig
nity. The number of complaints which
were prefentcd compelled it at length to aft
in a different manner. On the 25th Bru
maire, November 5, year 5, a declaration
was made of the grounds ef complaint, and
in order to bring about a negociation, too
long deferred, it draws from the treaties of
Paris and London the arguments bed calcu
lated to accelerate it. It was animated by
no h'iftile view ; no disposition towards ag
gression. In order to obtain justice from
the U. S. it places them in a situation to be
the firft to call for an arrangement. Let ss
fee whether it has rejefted any honourable
proposal.
Mr. Pinckney had set out before the de
claration of the 25th Brumaire, which sus
pended the aecuftomed relations. He came
to replace M. Munroe, and like him to
explain ami palliate the eondufl of the
United States, without any fpeeial powers
fufpefling the _ negociation desired of
France. He could not be received, not
being in a situation to perform the con
ditions under a resumption of political con
nexion. The President of the United States
thought it his duty to call an extraordinary
meeting of the Legislative Body. I (hall
not review this opening speech, nor the turns
which the debates took in the course of the
session. I (hall only fay the impression they
made at Paris was unfavourable previous to
the arrival of the Envoys; that this circurn
ftance raifed 3n obstacle which
ought to bava bÂ»en forefeen at Philadelphia,
that the Envoys themselves, unwilling to
observe the natural effedl of such provoca
tion, contributed to render its effeft more
durable- It, however, was finally made
to yield to the primitive desire ot a sincere
reconciliation. A proof of this you fee in
the txpedient suggested of treating wi h you
separately, for a government ho (HI el y dis
posed would not have yielded to that delicate
bias, which preserves honor, yet gives effcit
to pacific intentions. You given me
to understand, Sir, that it would have been
proper for the Executive Directory to have
backed the declarations I have made in their
name by a change in th* measures which af
feft the commerce of the United States. I
can answer to you that our government had
fufficiently ascertained its object, i:i conform
ing, from the beginning, to the French Re
public the rights which flow from its treaties,
but let us be less evaiiling, and m.rre equit
able, one toward another. Though thÂ«
measures taking by France are only the
confeqtience of those adopted by the United
States, you must have remarked, in my
propositions of the 30th, Prairial (June 18)
that the Executive Directory is, that their
refpe&ive preteufions (hould be examined
and regulated collaterally. It intends to
mark, in one aft, a durable monument of
th# futnre frisndlhip of the two Repub
licsâthe justice which they owe to each
other ; and every idea of falfe glory is dis
tant from its mind.
In taking leave of you, fir, I have thought
it my duty to give you this testimony of my
esteem.âit is manifefted in the unrestrained
confidence with which I addressed you,
and in the regrets which I feel from your
departure in the existing circumstances.

P. S. 17th Meffidar [July 13] âA cir
cumstance of infinite importance has retard
ed this letter.âl know not how it is but
at every step toward a reconciliation some
cause of irritation intervenes, and that al
ways originates in the United States. Some
days ago advices have been received by the
Executive Direftory, hurried beyond all
bounds no longer keeps up appearances. A
law of the 7th of last month authorizes it
1 to cause to be attacked every French (hip
of war which have arrested or entertain
â  ed intentions of arresting AmeriÂ«an vessels.
: A refolutioÃ of the House of Reprcfenta
: tives suspends, from the thirteenth of this
month all commercial relations with the
French republic and its dependencies. Se
veral projefts of lawÂ» have been propo
fed for bani(hing the French, a nd fe
queftratiog French property. The long fuf
fering of the Diredtory is about to (hew it
felf in a manner nbe < 'd in qviellioa.
Perfidy can never throw a veil over the pa
cific difpofitkms which it/ hag never ceased
t* manifeft. It is even at the moment of
thii new provocation, when it would seem
to have no honourable choice but that of ;
war, that it confirms the affuraaces I have
given you cm its behalf. In the present cri
(is it confides itfelf to a measure of ftcurity
and preservation, by putting a temporary
embargo on American vessels, with a re
feree of indemnity if it takes place. It is
(lill ready, it iÂ» as much prepared as ever to I
-terminate fey a sincere negociation the dif
ferences which subsist between the two coun
tries. Such is its rtpugnance to consider
the United States as enemie*, that in spite
of their hoflile derrronftrstions, it means to
wait till it be ir. tfiftably forced by realhof
ttlitie3.
Since you. intend to depart, hallen, at
least. fir, to transmit to yaur government
this folemrTdeclaration.

rtLLOW-CITIZENS,
OUR address of th; iftinft. was in
tended to present to your view the deplora
ble state of ouÂ» city, and to excite into ac
tive exertion the philanthropy and benevo
lence so eminently chara&eriftic of the citi
2ens of Pennsylvania. The fame generous
fer.timents which you have difplaycd has in
fluenced the worihy and benevolent citizens
of Bait more ; who always alive Ao the feel
ings of humeÂ»ify, have, it appears by the
public papers, agreed to a fubfeription for
the relief of our diftrefled fellow citizen!.
We return them all the gratituae and ref
to which dispositions so amiable are
entitled ; âbut it becomes our duty public
ly to (late that a surd has been provided for
the purpose, upon the principal of a loan
in anticipation of the liberality and justice
of our Legislature, which precludes the
necefSty of donations in money from the
humane citizens of our fitter states âCon
tributions of provisions from our fellow-ci
tizens in the country, as well in New Jersey
as in our own State, have been forwarded
far the use of the diftrefled,. with a liberali
ty which does honor to the donors.
We flatter curfclves that similar donations
will be continued by those generous indivi
duals, who are contiguous to the city, and
ean with convenience spare a part of their
produce for the relief of fufferfng humanity.
By order of the Board of Managers.

of an immediate supply of vegetables and
ftravv for th- use of those distressed citizens
who are flying from the present calamity.
The committee flatter therofelves.that the
farfe liberality will be found in the farmer,
and others, to supply this Encampment, as
basbeen to that ontheCommonsnearSchnyl

in view.
