Debate Â»n Foreign Intert'lurfe.
1 FRIDAY JANOARY 19.
[Con'iPued froni v<-ffetday's Gazeftr.]
Mr. Gallatin said, the committee had
; been told, in the course of the debate, by
c < some gentlemen that this attempt to reduce
I the number of our miniftera was unconftitu
' ] tional; by others, that it was inexpedient,
and even some gentlemen who agreed to the
general expediency of themeafure, believed
it would beattended withinconvenience from
our present foreign relations.
In relation to the couftitutionality of the
" thing, he did not believe, whatever doftrine
was suppOrted with refpeft to treaties, that
upon this occaiion the eommittee (hould be
told that they wtre interfering with âºbft con
stitutional power vested in the Prefdent. It
was true, that he had the genera.'power of
appointing ambafladort; but it was not less
true, that the legislature had the sole and
exclitfive power to provide forall the expenc
es of the union. Hence a'ofe the idea of
ours being a governmentoo r departments, so
it formed as to be a check upon each other.
K But the gentleman front Connefticut (Mr.
" N. Smith) said there vas no such thing as a
check of department?; that each was dif
tc tin<k ; and, though had checks within
itfclf, none of them checked the other. And
to illuilrate his poutioa, he introduced the
simile of a clock, at the fame time that he
told them that the Executive department
was the Main Spring which put the clock
in motion, whilst Mr. G. supposed he meant
that the other branches wÂ«re merelyithe hands
which moved 9s they were diredted. But if
there was any aft which could not be done
hut by all the branches, each had its share
<â  in deciding upon the propriety of it, Wheri
1 a treity was made, it had been argued that
that hotife had nothing te do but catty it
into effeft; but here it was said, that the
I,âtr. .. esc DounO to provide tor"every Am
bassador appointsd ; and if, by withholding
salaries, they obliged the President to fend
Ministers Resident, where he wilhed to fend
Miaifters Plenipotentiary, they would aft
inconsistently with the Constitution. Tho'
gentlemen might make Speeches on this
fubjeft, they mult know that where the le
gislature had a right to aft, it had a right
to deliberate and to use its discretion. That
is was better for the interest of the Nation
r that the Departments should aft in union,
he allowed, and also that it was right to give
the support to the Executive which the dig
â¢i nity and happiness of the nation required.
With tflpSSlWlty bv .
ameudment, he would a/k whettcrany thing
e had been said to (hew that the exteufion of
i our Foreign political con--
- duce to the greater happiness of the U. S.
d Our present critical situation was not owing
as had been ftatedby the gentleman from S.
s Carolina (Mr. Harper) to our Commercial
Intercourse, but from the operation of trea
-0 ties and our political conneftion. No truth
was more strongly impressed upon his mind,
1- than that the extension of our political in
tcrcouifc wftli ForcigirimtixfÃÃ was highly
_ dangerous to us. And when the gentleman
from Connecticut (Mr. Dana) charged those
r " who advocated this amendment with address-
R ing the galleries, and people out of doors,
1, | rather than the members of the committee,
Â» f ! Mr. G. supposed he believed the public o
] pinion was with them, and that it was this
I conviftion which produced the declaration.
I,Â» He said he thought the gentleman right, and
lr . that the people would read their fpecches,
e attend to the fubjeft, and decide with them
: againftincteafing our diplomatic interGOurfe.
Is Could it be said that any good had arisen
' from this source? It was true treaties had
e been made; but no treaty had been made
d since tht adoption of the present Govern
ment, by Ministers resident at any court at
e the time. If any benefits were derived to
e the country from the British treaty, they
muftbe attributed to the Envoyextraordina
' ry, and net to our Minister at that court ;
y and when our treaty with Spain was con
, eluded, it was necessary to fend a minister
* resident at another court to do the tufiDefs.
â j Since our treaties were always made by spe
cial envoys, what advantage could it be of,
to have numerous ainifteri plenipotentiary
in Europe? In the present critical situation
r of that country, agitated as it was to the
center, was it not to be apprehended tbat
1 our ministers would participate, in some de
. gree in the party spirit which there abound
ed, and rank themselves on one fide or the
other, which would have a tendency to draw
this country into a vortex from which we
were so happily separated by the Atlantic.
We were the only nation, he said, who pof
r fefied a Government on a firm foundation,
, in which civil and religious liberty vras fully
> recogqized; we, therefore, enjoyed, what
the people of Europe were seeking after.
We have nothing to wish, except to remain
. ill our present situation. Why then, (hould
we hazard the being involved in European
broils? He had before stated Consuls were
equal to every commercial regulation, and
1 he had heard nothing to change his opinion.
. Seeing, therefore, that these Diplomatic a
. genti were rather dangerous than ufeful, he
, thought it time toput aftop to their increase.
> It might be said, that in this opinion he dif
; feied from the Executive. He felt the
J weight of this remark, and it was with some
I diffidence that he cxpÂ»e(Ted it ; but it was
! his opinion, and thereforehe couldnot with
hold it. Whether the President had any
' information which led him to a different o
| pinion, he could not tell ; he could only aft
from what he knew, and he (hould not be
, deterred from forming an opinion because a
nother department of the government might
poflefr. information which he had not. He
should follow his own opinion, unbiassed by
any authority.
But it was said, though it might be pro
per to diminish our foreign iutercourfe, it
was improper to do it at present. He a
greed it wsuld be wrong to do it viole'iilv.
tint Wa? not the intentioii of
the mover of th>' amendment ; but h# couid
no objedlion to faying at tliis time when
the extension should cease With refpeÂ£l
to the gentlemen now abroad, they knew
when they accepted their offices, they were
liable to two events, viz. to the rccal of the
Prefidtnt, and to a refufal of the legislature
to renew the law relative to foreign inter
' course when it expired. It would, there*
- fore, injoffice to them to agree
to the amendment.
' Gentlemen considered the saving of a few
â  thousand dollars a year, a paltry economy,
and that it was necefTary to appoint men of
11 talents fully competent to â¢offices of this
kind. He agreed that competent persons
c o tight to appointed ; bht ministers resi
dent at a fMaty of 4<s co dollars a year were
â¢ pofTefieda/ the-fame powers with ministers
plenipotentiaryâthe onlytiifference betwixt
them was in their ftife of living. To low
[ er the salaries, therefore, would not dimin
ish the competition for these He
' did not know that the one salary would
command higher talents than the other ;
" nor did he suppose tllat when our ministers
1 resident at Portugal and Holland were cloth
' ed with tke commissions of ministers pleni
potentiary at Madrid and Berlin, and of
course their salaries doubled, that their ta
-1 lents received the fame proportion of in
crease.
' Mr. G. infilled ihat his former statement
with respect to the appropriations for this
: objeft were right, notwithstanding what
had been asserted by the gentleman from S.
Carolina to the coritrary.
But the advocates of this motion,'had
bteu charged with improperly drawing in
-1 to view the ftfbjtcl of executive patronage,
and when speaking upon this fubjeft, he
himfelf had been charged with mating an
" illiberal and unfounded charge." That
' *hat he said might be incorred, was prob
-1 able, frtnri -the information given by the
gentlciaybirom S. Carolina, but that what
he said wai illiberal and unfounded, he de
nied. Mr.G. said it was true, that the
â  sum of mor*y proposed to be saved by this
amendment was net large- Gentlemen might
if they pleaftd, call it a paltry saving ; but
having firft tftablifhed the faÂ£l, that these
officers were not only unnecessary, but dan
gerous, though the saving was not large,
it ought to be made. Bnt it was said that
out government was so pure, so untainted,
that the patronage which was wished to be
guarded again ft can have no effect in this
country ; and the gentleman from Connec
ticut had said the charge cotald have no
ground, exc/** V- b ,' s (Mr. G's)
ftandard. HeÃcnct t Â« t ha(
the observations on this fubjeS had nothing
to do with either of their hearts. He
should not expedl much credit to be given
to any declarations which he might make
on that floor as lo the purity b{ his mo
tives. Indeed, he took it to be his duty
to state his reafensfor"or against any qoef
tion which came before that house, and af
ter delivering them in the best manner he
was able, to leave thsm to have the effeft
they deserved. He thought the gentleman's
rcpnark, unworthy of notice,
but he again called fupon the committee to
consult tbe hifteryofall other nations whose
governments were, in any degree, fimilarto
ours, and it would be seen, that an undue
extension of executive patronage had been
the deftru&ion of them all. But was there
no reason to guard against this patronage
upon the gentleman's own ground ? There
certainly was ; for, according to their doc
trine, the power of the executive was un
bounded in its nature, and without check,
as they fay the PreCdent has a right to ap
point as many ministers as he pleases, and
that the legislature is bound to provide their
salaries. When such a doftrine was avow
ed, was it not right, he asked, to state all
the conferences to which it led ? He tho't
it was.
Again, he would ask, whether the ex
perience of this government lir.d not shewn
that this patronage, so far as it related to
the legislature, was more dangerous than a
ny other. In the last four years, five min
isters had been sent to Etn-ope, four of
whom had been taken from the legislature
of the United Statesâone, he believed,
after the periSd for which he was eleÂ£ted
was expired. Combine with this faft, that
it is the duty of tht executive to chufe men
for office only froito those whose opinions
are consonant to its own, and look at the
Gtuation of members of Congress. They
fee written, in legible characters, " There
is no hope of being appointed to office, except
your opinions be in conformity to those of the
executive of the United States."
If, said Mr. G. in the youth of our coun
try and government, we 1 do not feel the ef
fedi of this kind of influence, as it had
been experienced in other countries, it is
owing solely to that cause, and he would
venture to fay there was rio other legislature
in existence upon which such a faft would
not make some impreflian ; and if it did
not make any here at prefcnt, were thev to
suppose- that this country was so much more
favored by providence than others, that
the fame effefts might uot, in process of
time, be produced here, as had been pro
duced by fiwiilar causes, in other nations ?
And ought they not to giiird against it in
time ? lie thought prudence directed them
to do so.
With relpefl ta thdlttberal and unfounded
charge which-ah Taid he had made.â
When the gerjUriah from S. Carolina had dat
ed, that lince the appointment of an cmbafla
dor to Berlin, nothing hid taken place which
could induce uÂ«s to change our views- He, in
answer, dated, that there were other realuns,
l and then, Hot as it he were making any new
j discovery, asked if such a fa<St were n >l recol
lefied ; but, at the fame time, acquitted the
gentltjnaa alluded to ot under undue iin
preffions. Indeed he kuew that gentleman's
cpinxn lo well on matters, of this k:nd, that he j
was certain he would save votfd the money,;
wr-oever might have been appointed. But he'
j drew the conClusion that ha kuew the fail that !
J he was to be appointed to the office atthetime j
â  f y
. If that wis an illiliti a' concUifisn, ht wasgui'-
sty I but when a man fuppirted art appropria-
I tion to day, and three days after was appointed
to the office contemplated by it, it waj difficult
II to fippol'ehe knew nothing of it at the time
' The gentleman !rom S. Carolina had said it
v appeared from the journals>hat he did not know
e of it ; but he supposed, notwithllaading, that,
c mere than three days were neceflfary for the
e arrangement >-f fucb a bufjnefs. But it was fup
poferf he meant to make an illiberal attack upon
that g-n'lem.in ; the truth was, he did'not mean
the attack up~n the perfsn appointed, hut a
c gainfl the perfort riialti' g the appointment. â
He conceivedtheappÂ«>intÂ»ient improper; but he
t exprefTeHhimfelfasrfefir.-.'elyishewa*able Now
lie was put upon this h ad, he mart go farther.
Â£ He found iii the confutation thtf following
clause : " No senator, or reprelentative, (hall,
s during the time ftr which he wis elected, be
5 appointed to any civil office, under the authsri
- ty of the United States, 'jjkichfhal! have been
: created, or the emoluments of which'/bull biive
3 been encreafed, during such time." And here he
t would ask gestieinen wiio thought executive pa
tronage oufht nrt to bt feared, why rhe fram
ers of our conftitutiun inferred a clause of this
" kind, if they had not feared this patronage ? It
- was to this claufo of the conriitution, and to
I nÂ«ithing else, that he had reference, in the allu â¢
â  tion which he had made j and though the ap
-5 porntment mijht not be expressly agairift the
letter of the constitution, it was certainly against
its /firit.
' He would make only an additional remark in
1 relation lo expediency. It had been said that
â  topafa this amendment in our prefeat (Situation
with foreign countries, woold ten-d to (hew an '
exilting division betwixt the Executive of the
United States and the people. Thi6 argument
might be brought at all times, aÂ» the occafious
' were not unfrequent in which the several branch
es of govern nentdifferedin opinion; norwas this
to be lamented.it was natural, and what could
not be avoided. But it was said that those gov
ernments with whom we were eonnefled, might
take umbrage at a measure of this kind ; and
that when foreign countries lent ministers of a
certain 'grade to us, we were bound by the forms
cis etiquette to ret urn to them toiuillers of the
fame rank. To do thiÂ«, would be to d 3 fome
tbing more than what the prefidentof the Unit
ed States might require them to do, it was oblig
ing the legislature to follow, not only the will
the prcfident, but the whims and caprices of
every foreign nation who choie, from what rea
son nobody ceuld tell, to fend ministerial- cha
raflers to this country. To support an expente'
of this kind, he believed, would be making a
little.too free with the treafsry of the United
State-.
Gentlemen who supported this amendment
had keen charged with using declamation j yet,
said hi, those who thus charge us, tell the com
mittee, that we are persons ujho ivijb this ctun
try tamely to submit to the luill of a foreign na
titn ! He would alk whether, or not, this was
declamation ? HÂ« alked what connection fÂ«b
---! mining to the will of a foreign nation, had with
this amendment ? and what kind of difference it
could make in the termination of our present

The House having again resolved itfelf into a Com
mittee of the Whole, on the Bill providing the
means of Foreign Intercourse, and Mr. Nicho
las's amendment bcii.g under consideration,
Mr. Griswold said, ifinftead of redu
cing the number of our foreign Miuiifers
Plenipotentiary, it had been the intention of
the present amendment, to make an enquiry
into the reasonableness of the salaries at pre
sent allowed to our Foreign Agents, be
should most cheerfully have gone into the
investigation, as he believed it was a fubjeft
upen which the house bad a full right to le
gislate; but when he heard Gentlemen de
clare that this was not their objeft, but
that it was their intention to check a pow
er which the constitution had placed in the
Executive, the motion would meet his de
cided negative.
The ground which gentlemen had taken
went to declare, that though the Constitu
tion had said that the President, with the
advice of the Senate, should appoint Am
balTadors and other publie Ministers, the
Gentleman from Virginia and others, fay
that he should not do this; that they will tic
their hands so as to put it out of his power
tÂ» execute this provision of the Constitution.
So that in this question the people of the
United States and the Constitution were on
one fide, and the Gentleman Virginia,
and his friends on the other. For himfelf,
he had no difficulty in deciding, where such
were the parties.
If past experience had not tatight the
house that attempts were frequently made
to invade the Constitutional powers of the
Executive, such a motion as the present
wbuld produce surprise; but, as former at
tempts-os that kind had not only been made
but repelled as they ought, he trusted the
fame iflue would take place on. the present j
occasion.
Gentlemen had dated our Constitution as
filled with balances and cbecks, and that
different departments were intended to
check each other. He allowed that each
had checks, within itfelf: but if the depart
ments were to check each other, the govern
ment could not proceed? and however this
d.jftrine might be difcufTed with metaphys
eal fubtlcty, its tendency was to flop the
wheels of government. He hoped this doc
trine of checks which had been introduced
into the house by the gentleman from Penn
sylvania (Mr. Gallatin) would not extend
itfelf in this conntry, as it contained more
mifchiefs than Pandora's box. But suppose
for the fake of difcuflion. this dodlrine were
admitted, and that the house had a right to
check the Executive in the exerclfe of its
Constitutional powers, would it be proper
to exercise it on the present occasion? Was
it, even in the most peaceable times, pro
| per to curtail our Diplomatic Corps, since
! our Commerce fpveads to all parts of the
; world, and disputes tauft necefiarily arise,
!- which could be removed only ir, tl 4e ; nUr '
*- fereucc of our Ministers. Gentlemen ailed
"u ged that this could be done by Confulj ; it
e rtrucjc him not. Who were these Confuf s >
; t Men of refpeftability adoubtedly; but mtre
,r monied men, pursuing private ohjedts for
it. the purposes of gain, who pofleflcd neither
leisure nor ability to manage a buflnefs of
this kind. Diplomatic Agents, he said,
2 were uniformly employed in all countries!
2- except, indeed, in Turkey, or in the tyran
_ nical States of Barbary; States which he
ic truited Gentlemen would not produce for
w the United States to imitate. If even it
r ' Should bÂ« proper, in such a state of things,
S would it be properat this time? Was the pre
sent a state of tranquility and peace ? Were
our affairs going on well; was not Europe

rt were we unconne&ed with Europe? t)id
'' not our carry us there, aad was
'* not our capital there? Vet our Diplomatic
I, Agents are to be discontinued, and our com,
0 nierce left to Shift for itfelf, and in cafe
1 of disputes no explanations could be had.
Â»- The business was to be dropped at once;
â  and what was worse, it was to be done be
cause the Legislature placed Â«o confidence
â in the Executiveofthegavernmentâ-bccanfe
lt one department of government was opposed
n to the other, which had the appearance of a
n nation fighting againfl itfelf. Were gentle
e men desirous that such a pidture of our situ
ation Should cross the Atlantic ! He tho't
n Â° gentleman could fay this would be afting
s prudently.
d But, notwithstanding these confide'rati
-- ons, gentlemen (till fay tt>is motion ought
if to be agreed to, because the Executive is
Â« already poflVfFed of immense patronage,
m which is Spreading its mfiuence through e
. very department, and is become so alarrain-T
.. as to make it necessary to Sacrifice every co n b
t- iideration in order to have it lessened. When
he heard a language of this kind, he could
" scarcely refrain from smiling. Whit, h*
_ asked, was this alarming influence ? It could
L _ not be doubted that in some governments,
e . where the appointments were numerous, and'
a where the executive was a permanent eSta
d blifhment, immense influence might be ac
quired. But what was the Situation of our
executive ? It was true it had the power of
,! appointing to office ; but the offices were
not very desirable, and the execution of
â some of them Was atteuded with obloquy
.Â« and reproach ; besides, the duration of unr
>- executive was limited to a four years Icafe.
h And yet gentlemen charge this executive
* wi'h being possessed of an influense which
, they foretel will prove the definition of gov
"d ernment. Such opinions he could only con
y fider as mere chimeras of the brain, support
ed upon no rational ground.
But gentlemen went farther, and said
n that this power had already been actually a
" as the executive, in his appointments
' to office, had refpeft to the opinions o{
.. those whom he chose. He cpnfeffed.Ujat ,
he had thought, from some apuointrqeau
f- whtcti nÂ«a-oeeii made. that the jPhlUfnt'
"BacThot adopted the determiiialiju s
some gentleman were of opinoiYhe bad, tho
he acknowledged it was a determination
which every real friend of the government
mtift wish to fee adopted. Could it be fee
lievedj .that* the President would not.
Ie some refpeft to the opinions of the menjie
i- employed ? Gentlemen could not Ectcvf
this. What ! employ men wliofe very o
pinions and principles led to dilorder !âta
* appoint men to office for thepurpofeofprt
-11 serving order peace, whose very opini
y oris lend to disorganization and confufion \
â ' Was this to be done ? Me thought not ;
e and if the determination of attending to
the opinions of men appointed, had not been
â¢â¢ adopted, it ought to bs adopted. Indeed
he had been led to believe, that there was
a class of men in this country, who, from
1 the sober conviflions of their minds, being
convinced that most of the measures of gov
e ernment we;re wrong, had determined not
to accept of any office under it, and by that
means assist in its execution ; but ifheright
n ly understood the gentleman fro.4 Georgia
(Mr. Baldwin) he supposed he had been
e deceived in this refpedt, as he Seemed to fay,
that they were not only willing, but defi- ,â *
: rous of accepting offices uader
â " He could notTiave believed this, as it fijp
~ posed a baseness of character which he had _
r hoped did not exitt in the United States.â
What ! were gen lemen who had been unt
e formly opposed to every measure of govern
ment, now ready to Step in aÂ»d take part in
? the execution of that government ? Were
' they willing to become the juSlifiers of those
1 measures which they hr.ve heretofore ur.i-.
formly declared to be wrong ? He had hi
e therto refpefted this class of men, becauie
L * he believed they aifted from condition ; but
e if they were about to add hypocrisy to their
c other crimes, it was a proof of their total
want of integrity. Indeed, for a man to
" fay administration was right, when he be
" [lievedit was wrong, was to prove that lie
C 1 had no confctcnce. He thougÂ«t, therefore,
| it. was highly proper to chufemen only mio
s office who would aft from principle.
[ K- concluded, therefore, upon ertry
, ground, that the motion was wrong. Mr.
G- said he could not Sit down, without no
ticing some sentiments which tell from tuÂ«.
s gentleram from Virg.Gia, which wotea.t
rious ,al'peÂ£t, auditeuiud to aiqa Â«t tne very

. nouneing republics with Vengeance itwer.t
; to' tht: very foundation Â»f our government.
} It was a vyhich be never expectedtoltrartn that âit w" adoflrinevvliiclt
went to fay, that no reprefetitatfve republic
oaght to exist. But, he firmly believed,
that instead of depending upon minorities,
the people of this country would always de
pend upon majorities, whom, he doubted
not, would continue to preserve things as
they ooght to be. That the few ought to
be attended to, in preference to the many
was a doftrine which might suit aristocracies
but it would not do for this country. He
did not fee bow this observation wasconneft
ed with the gentleman's motion ; but he
thought it was an attack which ought not
to pass unnoticed, which mull b,e his apolo
gy for the digrefiion which he had made
in these remarks.
Mr. Bayard began his obferva'ions by
remjrking, that the gentleman from Vir
ginia had said, that it was not his deftgo
thrt' his motion should have an immediate
effed upon the minilters at present employ
ed. If the gentleman was sincere in his a
vowÂ»l, it was clear that he did not under
stand his own motion : for, whatever amend
merit was introduced into the third fie&ion,
whith the gentleman had intimated might
befÂ» amended as to give the regulation a dif
tantoperation, as it only related to the sura
of money to be appropriated, it would not
enable the President toemploy a tninifter ple
nipotentiary, besides those at London and
Pari/, at 3 higher salary than 4,5000 dol
lar*^
SÂ«me gentlemen have said, it was idle to
talk about this house having the power at
the fame time to use their discretion. He
tonlended that the power of appointing mi
nifies was vested in the President, and the
hou/e had no right to believe he would abuf*
this power. It had been supposed by the
gcitieman from Pennsylvania.that he might
appointanindefinite number of ministers, and
wei-e the house in that cafe, he asked, blind
ly .0 appropriate for them? This queflion
wai predicate*} tipon an abuse of power,
whiil the eonftitution supposed it would be
execated with fidelity. Suppose he were to
ftatethe queflion in an opposite light. Let
.it be imagined that this couatry has a mis
understanding with some foreign power, and
that the Executive should appoint a minif
tcr, but the house, in the plenitude of its
power, should refufe an appropriation.What
night be the consequence? Would not the
hnife have contravened the eonftitution by
t;king from the President, the power which
br it is placed in him ? It Gertainly would.
So that this supposition of the abuse of pow
e', would go to the definition of all au
tiority. The legislature was bound to ap
propriate for the salary of the chief justice
o the Unnited States, and though the Pre
sent might appoint a chimney fwcepCK to
tie office, they would flill be bound. The
cmflitution had traded the President, as
w.ll as it had trusted that house. Indeed,
iticas noteonceitable that the house could aÂ£l
.pn the fubjeft of foreign ministers. Our
VjtiWefts with foreign countries came wholly
uder the jurisdiction of the Executive.â :
Te^<Hrties of that house related to the in
tenal affairs of the country; but what re
laed to foreign countries, andforeign agent*
Mts veiled in the Executive Department.
' "Jie President was responsible for the man
nr in which thiÂ» business was conduced.â
Ie was bound to communicate from time
t> time, our situation with foreign powers,
ad if plans were carried on abroad for di
idingor subjugating us, if he were not to
: uake due communication of the design, he
would be anfwerablc for the negleÂ£l.
f But, without determining the point how
(far it was conflitutional for the house to in
terfere in the present business, it certainly
would not be prudent to do so at present.
AmbafTadors had been called honorablefpict,
to watch the operations of foreign govern
ments, in order to inform their own gov
ernment of every proceeding likely to affcdl
it ; and surely, if ever there were an occa
sion which called for such fpics, it was the
present, when we saw every principle of an
tient order overthrown, and principles of
disorder and villainy introduced which
were never known in ancient establishments.
Was it not seen that those countries which
were most powerful were dismembering and
dividing those which were weak, and in or
der to fettle terms of peace, no scruple was
to cede an independent government
and country, as a balance in the treaty.
Nay, he did not know, but at this moment,
foreign powers might be negotiating for a divi-
Jion of these veryJlates ! as a male-weight in
some adjuflment of belligerent differences.
He trusted, therefore, our ministers would
not be at present recalled ; for tho' they
might not ba able to dive into the secrets of
foreign cabinets, they would doubtless
communicate such information as would be
ufeful, and there was no probability of their
doing any harm.
But gentlemen wished, inflead of multi
plying our foreign connexions, that we
should recall every foreign agent at present
employed ; if even this were the wish of
this country, did it follow that it would be
the interefl of the powers of Europe to
follow the example ? If we refufed to fend
them ministers, thty would fend theirs so
this country, and the danger in this busi
ness did not arise from our ministers going
abroad, but from foreign ministers coming
here. And if foreign agents were sent here,
it was certainly policy, for the fake of in
formation and for the cultivation of har
mony and friendfhip, that we should return
the compliment.
But gentlemen said, these appointments ought
not to be made, because they increased execu
tive patronage. In addition to what had been
said on this fi.bjefl, he would remark, that so
far from these appointments multiplying the
friends of the president, he believed they in
creased hie enemies ; for by serving one person
in aB appointment, he alienated the affections of
twentr others by disappointment. Grnt'eineu
hid talked much about checks. He brlieved
they were sincere when they wilhed the execu
t"f to be checked. He believed they v ould
check and counter-check him, until they /topped
tie wheels of government ; and when hs was
manacled andiaid at the mercy of the house,
! they woul ( d be fatiÂ»s.d. For his part, he th-i't
! the executive the moil weak and in-irm branch
; o! the governnent, and that if any thing were
!to be feared, it was from its weakness. It was
not a constitutional i<lsa that this house should
' check the executive, but, that the president
should have the power to check the legislature.
For what reifon ! b;caufe *Ke executive power
i was defined ; its prerogative! are all Ipecififd ;
it could not a& improperly without the aiS be
( inj palpable to all the world ; but the limits of
the house of representatives wire undefined. â
j The eonftitution checked the president, but it
was neceflary for the p r Â«fident to check that
houfeâfor gentlemen could not suppose that a
pppular bods like that house should be immac
ulate, and that Â»o esprit du carps would ever
lead it to do business which did not properly be
long to it. It was the nature of fneh a body la
be more ambitious than an executive, defined
as ours was. The people v f the United States,
therefore, had more to fear from that house,
than from the president of the United States. â
The president had it not in his to do
much mifchief, but it was in the power of that
house to dejiroy the coujlitution.
Gentlemen had compared the patronage Â»f
the exrcutu e with the patronage of the execu
tive of the F.nglifh government ; as well might
they compare Calvin Philips to the Irijh Giant.
In this country, what was the power of this
patronage ? An army of 3 or 4,000 men, a na
vy of three fiigates, a number of cslleflors and
fnpervifors, whose fa'aries were only fufficient to
furnifh their daily bread. What was the cafe in
England ? An array almost without number.-a
navy incalculable, a church patronage unlimit
ed, an o.'der of nobiiity without number, fonrces
which furmfhed objefts of temptation tÂ» almost
every individual, besides the civil lift of a million
a year ! Eut what had the prelident of the U
i nitt-d States ? About as ninth at would furnifh
hisJire->woedand table ! Yet rhefe two lituations
ha l beea compared with each other. But not
withstanding the imroenfe patronage of the En
glilh government, if the principle of equal re
presentation were introduced into their house
ofcommons, he believed, not wit hfia ruling all
the power of the executive, they would lop off
prerogative after prerogative, till though there
might remain the features, the fubfunce of mo
narchy would be gone.
Gentlamen who advocated this amendment,
seemed to do it, hecaufe men of a certain opin
ion were appointed! to office ; as if thsy were to
fay, we know eur principles are such that we
have no chance of being appointed, therafore we
will not fuffer the president to appoint any body
else. The gentleman from Gtergia had ex
pressed great surprise on hearing this principle
avowed. But he afktd whether this was not a
principle of the firft authority in this country â
it was the principle upon which the sovereign
people themfclves adled. Did they ever chufe
representatives of a different opinion from them
felvesj He believed no one would fay they did.
If he, or the gentleman who differed from him,
held different opinions from those they held,
they should not appear in their present fituatiens.
The president was therefore juftified in aiftingin
the fame way ; and if he had ever deviated from
it, the deviation had convinced him of hi 6 er
ror ; aad profit ting by this experience, he trust
ed a similar conduct would bÂ« avoided in fu
ture.
Something had been said about the constitu
tionality of the appointment of our present min
ister at Portugal. The gentleman from Penn
sylvania had supposed, that whan the gentle
man who was appointed, advocated the appro
priation. that hÂ« was to be-employ
wl. iHe believed it had been incontrovertibly
shewn that this was not the cafe ; but the gen
tleman had since said, that he did uot mean to
cast blame upon him, but upon the president.
Mr. B. denied that the president had adled un
constitutionally, as had been insinuated ; and he
thought when it was known with what delica
cy the president had a&ed in refuting to aocept
of the house whith had been built for him by
the state of Pennsylvania, a charge of this kind
ought not to have been brought, without better
ground for it. The office which the gentleman
from S. Carolina had accepted, was not created
by the appropriation ; It existed Jong before,
nor was it created by any law, but by the presi
dent ; nor was the salary increased, ac the falarv
of a miniftT plenipotentiary waÂ« long ago fet
tled. But though it wai not within the letter
of the eonftitution, the gentleman said it was
within its spirit ; tmt he did not know how that
gentleman's fagaeity found a spirit not ex pre (P
ed in the eonftitution.

Please to publish the following reply to
the article in the Aurora of yesterday, rÂ«Â£-
pedting Yankee checks and balances.
It appears to be in the contemplation of
certain anti-federalifU to introduces new
systemânot of checks and balancesâbut
of absolute preponderancy. This prepon
derancy, is designed to operate in favor of
the house of representatives, so as tc kick
the beam in favor of the house, and ren
der the powers veiled in the executive a
mere nullity. This may propefly be called
Virginia preponderancy, as it has taken its
rife from ftate. By means of this o
ver-balance, the house of representatives is
to draw all power into that branch, and
become the governmentâexecutiveâlcgif
lative and judicialâa-la-mode de Paris.
Whether this system of preponderancy o
riginated with the mover of it, or fton the
correspondent of Mazzci, is not said: but
let it have sprung from what source it may,
the objeft is plainâand goes to destroy the
power constitutionally vetted in the execu
tive branches, and disorganize the govern
ment by destroying its checks and balances.

In this splendid specimen of the taste and
judgment of the agents who planned and fi>-

happy to find thepublicconfidencecomplete
ly juftified. Long may it continue an or

is erefted, and a monument of the public
spirit of the people of Massachusetts, sacred
to the purposes to which it has been de

In the business of legiflatjon we shall care
fully endeavor to do every thing ih our pow

We shall duly attend to the other im
portant iubjedts mentioned by your Excel

.All parts of this Commonwealth afford
strong evidence of the general prosperity and
happirefs of oÂ»r ftllow-citizens, and were
it not for the evils to which our commerce
lias been fubje&ed in consequence of the
war in E'jrcpe, we might justly consider
jjurfelve* as a people in circumstances a;
. truly eligible, as ever, by the bounty of
Heaven, hare been allotted to any nation
on the Globe.
With fondntf* we indulge thehope that
the CommiflioDejs of the United States now
at Pans, for the purpose cf adjuring, by
amicable negotiation, all causes of difference
with the French Republic, will be fuccefs
ful, and hnppilv restore that harmony so
much to be desired.
We are deeply inpreffed with the impor
tance cf the'fubje&, and are fenfiblc it be
longs to ihe government of theUpited States
and while wt refleft, that since the adoption
of that government, there
of has the refpett, and commanded
the confideace of the people oFthe Union ;
v.'e anticipate with pleasing confidence the
adoption of such measures by that govern
ment, as shall be best calculated to secure
the rights and property, as vvell as the free
dom of the People of the
United States ; and feel the fulled convidt
ion of the concurrent support of our fellow
citizens of this Commonwealth in aid of all
such measures:âNor are we less allured
every attempt to diminish the confidence of
the people of the Commonwealth in rhe free
ly elefted members of the government of the

CHARLESTON, Jan. 4.
A letter dated Cape Nichola Mole, De
cember Bth, from Capt. Hunter, of the
{hip Pallas, which was captured off our bat
on the 18th or O&ober last, by a French j
privateer, informs his owners in this city, '
that after the capture, the Frenclt Srrew j
which was put on board of hi 3 {hip carried j
her into Porta Plata, in St. Domingo; on
her arrival there, the Spanilh government
refufed to condemn her ; they then got her
under weigh and left the port; on the 22d
of November, {he was chafed into Monti-
Chrifto, by the Thames frigate, which on
the evening of that day sent her boats and
cut her out; file was then carried into the
Mole. A fort and three privateers fired on
the ship while they were cutting her ou: ;
a 24 pound {hot went into her hull. The
trial of the {hip was to come on at the Mole
on the 9th, when it was supposed (he and
her cargo would be wholly condemned, as
the cutting her out of the enemy's port pre
cluded all claims from the owners. All the
letters and papers capt. Hunter had on
board were taken by the prize master and
his crew, whrch left the {hip in a boat, be
fore the frigate's boats got possession of her.
