Debate on a Repeal of the Stamp A3.
MONDAYâFEBRUARY 26.
(Concluded fin n y/lerdnf'j Cazetl.)
Mr. Har per was not of opinion that this
motion ought to be rtjefted. No doubt
there wa* information enough to convince
gentlemen the refolation ought to he rejeft
ed; but it appeared by the vote whieh had
been taken that the information Lid before
gentlemen had net bee* fuflieiently attend
ed to, and he thought there were other state
ments which would have a powerful influence
on this qfceftinn. Mr. H. denied tfiat the
stamp aft wat exclusively appropriated for
the refunding of the 800,000 dollar! to be 1
borrowed by the President. Incontempla- |
tion of what event Mr. H. aflced, was thia j
stamp duty laid ? It would be recollefted
that it was to provide forthat expence which
would be confrquent on a situation of things .
into wliich we might be drawn by ourunad- !
justed difference* with a foreign power.â
The Congress met at their extraordinary ses
sion under a if-rong impceflion that thiÂ» event
would take place ; and though the determi
nation of the question was podponed by
fending a million, yet they deemed it wife
to resort to a revenue to meet an expence j
which might result. Let gentlemen ask one
farther question. Has the probability of the !
neceflity of great expencei diminished since !
that period? So far as we know, ev.Â»- ap
pearance grew wore inauspicious. Those
very envoy*, with whom it was said France
could not refufe to treat, because they went :
specially empowered, weknowwere fix weeks
in Paris before any notice was taken of them. !
Hostilities upon our commerce are yet con- !
tinned. It was well known that changes '
had taken place in the French government
which had cot off all hope of reconciliation.
At that time there was a party in power fa
vorable to this country; but they had been
expelled, and the whole of the powers of
the government are now in the hand* of per
sons the molt hodile to thia country. Can !
it be said then, that the danger of our situ- j
ation iÂ» diminished, or the neceflity of pro- I
vidiug for a possible eXpence lessened ? And
unless gentlemen were determined, when the ,
clouds grow blacker and blacker, ti>un- '
der is every moment expefted to break up- j
on our country, to dimini/h our means of |
proteftion and defence, he could not fee up
on what ground they could take away this
source of revenue. Â£7' he Speaker reminded
Mr. H. of the qitrjliorij. Mr. H. could not j
allsw that the house had all the information
which might be given on this fubjeft. The
extent bf the appropriations for the present
year was not known All the sums neces
sary had not yet been joted. There was a
great difference of opinion as to the extent
of some measures. Large sums, he said,
were r.cceffary foi arms, magazines, fortifi
cations, frigates, revenue cutters, SLc. and
until it could be determined how much was
to be expended upon thefc objefts, it could
not be ascertained what revenue would be ne
ceffarv. It was well known that our situa
tion with refpeft to France, grew honrly
more uncertain ; and until we knew what
was to be the iffne of this hufinefs, was it
prudent to throw out so large an item from
our revenue? Might we not have occaliori to
go much farther in fortificationsâto raise
troops âan additional regiment of artillery,
to call into aftual service a considerable part
of the 80,000 militi.> which had been or
dered to be held in readinessâand to equip
gallics for the pioteftion of &c.
When gentlemen considered tnefe things, he
tru'ded they would at least, give time for
considering this vote. Knowing what had
taken phce in another branch of the legifla
tnre, he did not anticipate the vote, which
had been given, especially when it mull be
known that the ovjy effect which such a vote
could have, woulci be to increase the difcon
tente which may already exist in fuipe parjs
of the country-agiinil this law. He hoped
the decision would be podponed.
Mr. S. Smith believed the gentleman last
up did inÂ»t anticipate the vote which had
been given, or he would not havt pressed
the fubjeft upon the house.
Mr. Coit was in favor of the podpone
ment, in order that the committee of ways
and means might, in the mean time make a
report on the fubjeft of the revenue.
Mr. Macon thought there was no
fity for poflponing a question which had
been fix weeks before the house. He tho't
much extrinsic matter had been introduced
into the difciiflion. He did not know what
this question had to do with the French go
vernment, or our refinance ; if it were ne
cessary, there was no doubt we (hould be
ready to icfilt oppreflion. The ttue reason
for wishing the podponement was, gentle
men expefted to be in a majority, and they
had found themfelvea in a minority ; as to
information, gentlemen did not yrant it foi
themfelvea, but for ether*, who voted for
the repeal, who themselves neither aflced
for it nor wanted it. This was only the
firft stage of the business, aid there would
be no want of opportunity for gentlemen
to discuss the fubjeft as much as thry pleat
ed, before the billpaffed. It was said the
law passed by a considerable majority ; but
since that time, Mr. M. said, gentlemen
had been with their constituents, and had
leifare to refleft upon th* fubjeft, and might
now fee reason to change their vote. He
had no deubt of the present revenue being
equal to the expenditure, and when more
wa* wanted, it would be time enough to
provide it ; and if more was wanted, he
thought a more eligible mode might be hit
upon than a (lamp-la*.
Mr. Sewall wa* in favor of the post
ponement. If he wa* ceitain the revenue to
t,e provided by this law wa* not wanted, he
should be in favor of the repeal ; but he
wa* not prepared to change his opinion, un
til he had more information on. the fubjeft.
He thought the friends of a repeal, ought
to be for the postponement, in order to give
time for gentlemen to be convinced of the
fact that this revenne is nnnecc flary. In that
cafe, the repeal would pass almost uuani
tnoufly. To fay this tax is unpopular, is i
dle and foolifh. It was true the people in
forae parts had got a whim of this fort, and
they speak of thi* law in the fame way as
of the British damp-tax, though it i* quite
a different thing. A majority of that hpufe
voting for a repeal must have a tendency to
increase that discontent which has a'ready
appeared against the law ; and if the se
nate should continue to aft as tiey have
done, fueh a vote would tend to cad an o
dium upon them as the cause of retaining
an aft which they do not like. He hoped
the postponement would be agreed to, par
ticularly as the gentleman from New-York
had alked for information on the fubjeft.
Mr. T. Claiborne was against the post
ponement. If we remained at peace we
did not want this tax j and if we were to
be engaged in war, it would be worse than
nothing as it would only serve to vex the
people, when all ought to be unanimous in
the common cause. The people in my
country, said he, abhor it; it is as obnox
ious to them at pot/on.
Mr. Gallatin said, with refpeft to the
information wanted by the gentleman from
New-York, he had already enough to vote
for a repeal of the bill, and if the ques
tion of postponement wa* loft, he doubted
not he would again vote for the repeal. He
observed that when this fubjeft was called
up, the gentleman from S. Carolina dated
the neceflity of going into it immediately
Â®n account of the three months notice ne
cessary to be given before the law takes ef
feft. So.that if a postponement three
weeks were to take place, it wouldbe im
pofGble the law could pass in time ; to car
ry this motion, therefore, would be a re
jeftion of the question. Mr. G. insisted
upon his former statement being correft with
refpeft to the money to be raised by the
stamp aft being intended to repay the loan
of 800,000 dollars. If it had been inten
ded to meet the expences of a foreign war,
the house would certainly not have Hopped
with a'ftamp and fait tax ; they would have
gone on to have raised something equal to
the demands which must have come againfl
the government, in fueh a result. But it
was said, the lituation of European affairs
is become still more alarming. He believ
ed it was impoflible for them to fay whether
our situation with refpeft to European
powers is worse or bttter than it was in the
ftimmer, as they had no information upon
which to depend ; and ftil! less did they
know whether the event of the expuliion ;
of certain members of the government would
tend to promote a general peace (which he
believed would insure our own) or lengthen
the war, and consequently endanger our
peace. It wa* poflible, that during the
present fnflion of congress, the situation of
the country may be such a? to induce the
house to raise a much larger revenue than
we have at present ; but this was no reason
for the house now to go into railing revenue
which is not wanted. Indeed it would be
an additional reason for repealing the aft,
as he conceived it would be proper in our
present situation, not only tq coofult the in
terclls of the people, hut their prejudices.
The gentleman from Maffachufett*' called
them whims. Let them be so. In the pre
sent situation of the courttry, however mis
taken were their ideas, to it was their
opinion that the aft should be repealed,
would be a strong reason with him for vot
ing its rc-peal. If he were to consult hi#
own opinion, he believed there were other
afts more opprefiive than the stamp aft
would be ; but, in all cases of taxation, he
was willing to facrifice. bis own opinion to
the public opinion. It wa) the duty of the
house to endeavor to correft the public o
pinion, where they thought it wrong ; but
at present, he believed, it would be bed,
in a good degree, to consult it ; as the aft
was fufficient to create disgust to the go
vernment, without being very effeftual.
Â£ Thefpcaher reminded Mr. G. of the qurJlion.~\
Mr. G. remarked that though a vote had
been taken in favor of continuing the tax
in the other branch of the legislature, that
vote, on a future day's might, from a con
viftion of its impropriety, be reversed.
What had been said about a land tax, he
looked upon as a mere threat, as he did not
suppose any such question would come be
fore the house at the present session.
Mr. Varnum called for the yeas and
nays upon this question.âAgreed.
Mr. N. Smith said the gentleman from
Pennsylvania had told the house that the
gentleman from New-York had already vo
ted far the repeal, and that he doubted not
he would do so again, and that therefore he
had no need of information. Should they,
then r force gentlemen to vote before they
are prepared-? He always thought it wat
their bufineft to inform and be informed, and
come to a temperate result ; and when thiv
wat done, the opinion of the majority was
the Politual Standard. But, instead of thia,
the gentleman from Pennsylvania made him
felf the political standard ; at if a member
was not prepared to vote, he would forct
him to vote unprepared. This was not an
upinion which he could fubferibe to. Mr.
S. said, he asked for a postponement on hi*
own account. He was one of those who,
if convinced that our present revenue will
meet our present expencei ; and that our
revenue wilL not decrease, nor our cxpenees
increase, and that there will be a surplus re
maining to meet the demands which will be
â  made upon ut in 1801, he would moll hear
' tily vote for the repeal. And if thi* were
the ground upon which gentlemen voted the
repeal, instead of a bare majority, they
would bave a unauimops vote. But could
any one fay, that our present revenue it e
qual ;o our present expence ? Could any one
fay that cur revenue will not or
our expencei increase ? they cannot,
when there it so uuch uncertainty with ref
peft to our foreign relation!. When we
kno(* not whst"a day nny bring forthâ
when we cannot tell but that such depreda- '
tions may be committed upon our commerce
a* may greatly decrease our revenue*, and
(hat necessary preparations for our defence
may vastly increaTe ourexpepces. Was this,
then, a fit nation for repealing a law forrai
fing revenue ? He thought not, ; he hoped,
therefore the question would be postponed ;
and, in the meantime, it was probable some
information would be received on the fuf>-
jest of our foreign relations. But it was
said, this a<ft was unpopular, and because
of our dangerous situations, the opinions
of the peoplt ought eo be consulted, whe
ther well or ill founded. No man wonld
fopner conflilt the opinions of the people
than he, when they were founded with deli
beration ; but it was dangsrovi? in the ex
treme to meet the opinions of the people
when prematurely formed. What did the
petition which had been received, fay ? It
fay the aft was unpopular ; but that
it was copied from an aft of a foreign na
tion, and that it was an aiit which had giv
en offence when attempted to be imposed by
a foreign eountry. These were reasons
which no gwcleman would urge for the re
peal ; and he was convinced when the en
lightened people of America came to exa
minÂ« the fubjeft, that this tax would be as
agreeable to them as any other tax. It would
be found that not only the British, but the
French nation had a tax of this kind ; and
d/fil it was a popular tax wherever it was
Saopted.
Mr. J. Wilham! had seldom known
pbjeftions made to the postponement of a
fubjeft so important as the present. If the
gentleman from Pennsylvania by
this means to f*curc his vote, he would vote
against him, and he was seldom in the habit
of votiag with him. The arguments of
gentlemen againfl the postponement were so
contradiftory, that he thought when they
came to review them, they would thera
felvesbe in favour of the motion. It was
said by the gentleman from Pennsylvania
that it was neceflary to give way to popular
opinion. If this argument had not hereto
fore been nfed, the refourees of the country
would have been applied to some years ago,
and our debt paid off. Gentlemen them
selves confefs thjit the people who complain
against the (lamp-law have no cause to com
plain against it, as it is not calculated to
affeft them. The yeomanry of the coun
try, therefore, only wanted time to consider
it, in order to be reconciled to the ftamp
law ; they would always aft right when
time was given them for refleftion, and their
good sense would t*ach them, on cool rc
; fleftion, that they would be benefited by the
! aft, provided a repeal, would produce a land
tax.
Mr. Giles said,â¢ the fubjeft had been
called up by the chairman of the commit
tee of ways and means, himfelf, so that he
niuft have conceived the house ready to vote
upon it. One of the questions, indeed, re
ported by the committee of the whole, had
already been decided ; but when the second
was about to be taken, the yeas and nays
were called, and previous information was
said to |be neeefTary. If information was
really wanted, there would be time enough
to obtain it, before the bill paflfed ; it was
futile, he said, to put off the deciiion upon
the limb of a proportion which had already
been afted upon. Mr- G denied that this
stamp-ast had any thing to do with our fo
reign relations, indeed when the chairman
of the committee of ways and means' firft'
rofe,he did not so consider it. He was him
felf upon the committee of ways and means
when this law was agreed upon ; but he ne
ver heard fueh a thing fnggefted. If war
was apprehended, and this tax was meant
to furnifh a part of the expcHce, he desired
gentlemen tolook at itsinfignificancy to such
an_objeft. Indeed, he believed if such a
state were to take place, this tax would do
more harm by the diffatiafaftion which it
would excite against government, than the
money it would raise would do good ; but
he was certain it had never been considered
in any other light than as a peace arrange
ment.
A motion was made for adjournment and
negatived 57 to 38.
Mr Sitoreaves said, al the gentleman
from Virginia seemed pleased with the noti
cing afts of inconsistency, he would furnifh
him with another ; for, though he had spo
ken against the postponement, he should
vote in favour of it. He should do this for
three reasons; firft; as thereafon which he
gave for believing that a lengthy difcufiion
was unnecessary, had been declared out of
order, he supposed it would be out of
order to aft upon it; the second was because
! gentltmen appeared afraid of a postpone
ment; and the third was, because the yeas
aud nays were called, and when that was
the cafe, he wilhed to appear on the fame
row with his friends;
t The question on tbe postponement for
three weeks was then taken by yeas and
mays (as stated in our minute) and negatived
52 to 41.
Mr. Allen then moved au adjournment,
which was negatived 49 to 43.
Mr. Gordon moved the postponement of
the question for a week.
Mr. Brooks called for the yeas and nays
upon this question, which was decided to
be so taken by 18 members rising, which
were decided to be one fifth of the whole
number ptcfent.
The yeas and nays were then taken, and
were the fame as before,, except that Meflrs.
Bullock, GilUfpie, and Grove, who voted
in the negative of the last question, voted in
affirmative of this, which made the num
bers (land 49 to 44.
Mr. Sitgreaves again moved an ad
journment, which was negatived 43 votes
being only in ita favour."
Mr. Gordon then went into some obser
vations against the repeal. He-did not
think because the law was obnoxious "to a
few people, that it ought to be repealed;,
nor did he think because some gentlemen
stated the law as operating unequally, was
a good reason for repealing i'. A convic
tion of this kind ought to lead gentleman to
endeavour to make the law more e?fbal, and
not to repeal it. He acknowledged thatlhe
had not made due use of the information
within his power; for he was not fufficient
ly informed to vote upon the fubjeft, and
therefore he wilhed to have it postponed.
He begged gentlemen to consider in what
view they would hold up Congress to the
world, if they made and unmade laws in
this way. No dependence could be placed
upon the consistenCy of their proceedings;
every law thac was at all difpleafng to any
part of the community, would be constant-
Iy expefted to be repealed. He should, at
present, be compelled to vote agsiiift the re
peal, though if time were given for au en
quiry into the fubjeft, he might vote 111 fa
vour of it.
Mr. Sprague said, the fubjeft had been
before the houfelix weeks, whichhe thought
was fufficient time for members to have
made themselves acquainted with the fub
jeft. He should vote for the repeal, from
the evidence which had beed laid before him
of the fufficieney bf our revenue for our exr
penfe6, and that the stamp-tax was unnecessa
ry. It was"upon this ground, that he voted.
Mr. Allen again moved an adjourn
ment, which was negatived, there being on
ly 30 votes for it. ,
Mr. Coit spoke againlt the repeal He
considered the question as a choice between
a stamp and a land tax, and in this point
os-view he thought it important.
Mr. Tbatcbsr was afraid that a reason would
operate in the repeal of this law, which wasde
rogatory to the legislature of the United Statesâ
which was, a prejudice tgainf tbe found Â»f Stamp-ett ;
, for all acknowledged that this law bore no fem
( b'ance to the Â«afe which had given rife to the ha
tred of a fianip-afl. This plea prejudice had
frequently been brought before the houfc. He re
collected that in the year 1789, when it was pro
pefed to by a duty on goods imported, a gentle
man from Georgia entertained the house a long
time with urging this plea on behalf of his condi
ments against a duty on powder, as the pet*
pie of Qeorgia were fond of thediverfion Â»f Jhaot
ing ri(t-lirdi; but that prejudice was overcome, the
law was palled, astd it wa. found a good on*. No
foener wai an excise proposed, thau thi house was
again told of this prejudice ; but it was now ad
mitted, that the tax was a good one, and the pre
judice was overcome. About four years ago, an
additional duty was prÂ»pofed upon the importation
of iron ware ; when it was objeifted that there
was a strong prejudice ii iavor of imported 4Â«1
aid wfk All thtfe prejudices had, in their turn,
died away ; and he hoped the present would be
permitted to hay its exit in the fame way. As to
the law optrating principally upon merchants,ban
keu, hucksters, &c. he was/glad of it; he wilhed
all '.axes principally to operate upon them, beca.fe
they could moll cafily fnrnifli the money to pay
them. As fr> the reason given for the repeal that
cur revenue waÂ« fufficient for every demand against
it, he was not aflured of this; he wilhed to retain
this law until he saw the issue of our present litu
ation.
Another question wai taken for adjournment,
and fcegatived, there being Â«nly 31 votes for it.
Mr. HARPea tlieu moved for a postponement
till to-morrow. Me did not m kc this motion with
a view of obtaining a different vote ; but hecaufe
the difcufiion had com ion unexpectedly ; for, tho'
hiinfcll had called up the fubjed, he did not expe<st
a de!>ate upon it. He thought the prefTurc fer
the qutflion had bern in this e,.fe unprecedented.
Mr Gits s said there had been already attempts
enough to get rid of the question ; ha hoped this
would meet with tbe fame fate with the others.
Mr. ALi.BN spoke in favor of the postponement;
he pledged his honor that he wanted information
on the fuVjedt.
Mr Dana urged the propriety of the postpone
ment, as this question went to decide the princi
ple.
Mr. Sitcreaves hoped this postponement would
take place, that if gentlemen were refufed an op
portunity to think upÂ«n the fubje&, they might at
lead have an oppportunity to speak upon it. It
was a thing unprecedented in that house, when a
member deelared he wanted information, or wilh
ed to deliver his fer.timents upou a question, to re
fufe a poftpoiiement of its deciiion. He aiked whe
ther this request was not peculiarly reafonabie od
the present oceafion ? Some gentlemen had ftaied
that their reaforis for voting for the repeal of this
law was because it was unpopular. Was it rcsfon
able, therefore, to ffut gentlemen in a situation of
opposing popular opinions, without giving them
leave to exprefsthe grounds upon which they a&-
d t He complained of this fort of treatment. He
should certainly vote against the repeal; he did not
himfelf want information ; he had no hefitatlon
on his mind with refpeik to his vote ; but he had
a desire to explain the reasons upon which he ailed. 1
Mr. Vaunum said the gentleman last up com
plained without ground. He and those who vot
ed with him did not want rime or information in
the morning ; it was only fincc they found they
were in a minority that this want was discovered.
Mr. Csamplim had no ohjeikion to a postpone
ment of the deciiion till to-morrow.
fylr. Nicholas could net consent tÂ« a postpone
ment of tkis question, because the means used to
put off the deufion hid been unprecedented. The
rcafonft given for it by the gentleman from Penn
sylvania could not prevail with any one. He con
fcffes he does not want information ; and he will
have full opportunity to give his opinion to the
public befor# the bill pafies. With rcfpevfl to gen
tlemen *iot being he thought it a curious
thing. They were prepared to vote until the yeas*
and nays were called for; but when these were
called, they wanted information.
Mr Bkooks spoke in favor of a postponement.
and condemned the want of candor ia gentlemen
perfiiling to take the question before gentlemen
were prepared to vote. Was this conduct, he a(k
ed> intended to give encouragemcn to the fitting
up <-;f iVbiJkey and Liberty Pola ? It looked like it.
\_ tbi Speahr calltd to trier
Mr. S. Smith alked who prevented gentlemen
from giving their reasons upen this fubjeft ? Had
not thvy themselves prevented the main question
being brought into view by continual motions to
pcfyone and to adjourn ? Most alluredly they had.
If they had gone into a difcu.ffion of the merits of
the qutllicfti at firft, three hours might have been
spent in the liifcuflion.
After fcveral other observations, the question
for postponement till to-morrow, was taken and
negatived 46 to 41.
The question was then taken by yeas aud nays,
on agreeipgto the following resolution :
" Rcfolved, that tbe committee of ways and meant bt

Adjonrced.
WEDNESDAY FEÂ»R*UARY 28.
The bill so* ere&ing a light house and
placing certain buoy* in placts therein men
tioned, was read the third time and pafTed.
Mr. Livingllon from the committee of
commerce and manufactures, reported a bill
for the; relief of sick and diseased feamcn,
and a bill declaring the crnifrnt of Cengrefs
to an aft of the state of Massachusetts, ia
refpeft to certain piers, which were com
mitted to committees of the whole.
Mr. Van Alen from the committee ap
pointed to enquire whether any and what
alteration! are necessary ip the law providing
for the payment of the public debt, made
a report which was committed for to-mor
row.
Mr. D. Foster from the committee of
claims made an unfavorable report on the pe
tion of John Franklin, who prayed forcom
penfation for certain supplies furnifhed dur
ing the war, which was concurred in.
Mr. Livingfton moved that the petition
of Aquilla,Giles, agent for furdry inhabi
tants-os Long Island, presented in the year
1791, and reported upon by Secretary of
the Treasury in 1792, be referred .to the
committee of claimsâAgneed.
Mr. Harper moved that the unfinished
bulinefs might be poftpoÂ»ed for the purpofc
of taking up the bill for repealing the stamp
aft, as', if it were to be repealed, the foon<
er it was known the better, that the exp'en
five preparations which were going on for
carrying it into effeft, might be Hopped j
and if it were to ge into effeft, the loonet
i.t was so determined the better.
The question was carried, and the house
accordingly went into a committee of the
whole on this bill, hut reported it without
debate or amondment. The house took it
up, and on the question's being put for paff-'
ing the bill to a third rtading.
Mr. Isaac Parker called for the yeas and
nays ; but upon its being suggested by Mr.
Harper and Mr. Sitgreaves, that it wsuld
be best to take them on the passing of the
bill, the motion was withdrawn.
Mr. Lyon renewed it.
The question was put for taking the ques
tion by yeas and nays, but 16 members oa
ly appearing in favor ef it (which wtre not
one fifth of the number present, which is
necessary) it was not carried.
Mr. Harper moved that the bill be read
a third time to-day, fdf- the rcafons he had
mentioned. Had gentlemen who were in
favot of the repeal, permitted a difcuflion of
the fubjeft before the principle was.fettled,
he flionld have been glad to have delivered
his sentiments upon it. For this purpose,
he had desired a delay of twenty-four hours,
but the requtfft was refufed ; this having
been the cafe, he ftould not now, fines the
principle had been decided, go into any ob
servations again ft the measure. He hoped,
therefore, the bill would be read a third time
immediately.
Mr. Baldwin proposed that this bill should
be read a third time to-morrow.
The question was taken on the mod dis
tant day, and negatived 51 to 40.
The question for reading the hill a third
time to-day was carried.
It was accordingly read the third ti%ie,and
the question on passing, was taken by yeas
and nays as follow :

GENTLEMEN,
j, In compliance with your rcqueft to be
u- informed, " whether the committee were u
ie nanimous in their report on the conttfted e
]â¢ lc&ion of Mr. Israel?" I do not hesitate to
ce fay that they were. A day or two before i
the committee had reduced their report into
e- form, a separate qucftion was taken on the
several article* contained is the fpecification
of the petitioners and ti]ton each of them,
â e- the committee was unanimous. Immediately
ill before the chairman had by order ofthe com
-1 mittee, signed the report, one of the mem
berÂ» exprefled a doubt, as to a point which
he had not fully examinedâhe was told by
o ' n the Committee, that if he wiflied further
he time to fatisfy his mind, he Ihonld be in
is dulged, and that the report would be poll
is 1 pÂ®ned for one, two or more days if neceffa
pt ry, as it was the general wi(h that the una
; nimify which had hitherto prevailed in the
" e i committee should continue. He observed,
c . that as all the other members were fatisfied
an I as to the fadl upon which he had doubted,
he he did not wifhfot any delay, was fatisfied,
and the report of the Committee was agreed

and many thov.fand milei hailie rode, on t 1 t
evangelfcnl raiffion of diffufing the fire or
exclulive patriotism. Among hit friends hi
toallrd the names of Hancock, S. Adams,
Jarvis, Sullivan, Austin, and ofall the horde
who looked up to them for the true creed
ol political faith. In thÂ« profpeft of ap
proaching death, this patriot made his will
Â»hd named for his executor a gentleman who
had always been opposed to him in politic*
and who bore the charafter of an honed
ftatinch friend of government. The gen -
tleman, having received information of hit
intended appointment, begged to be exsufÂ«
ed and alkrd him w v y he did not appoint
one of his own particular friends, from a.

AT a juncture when the question of
a Commercial Treaty vtitb France may soon
bccumc an aljiA of difcuiEon, a work of this kind
becomes extrnnely ufefut to those eitizens of thÂ«
United States, who may be defirons to enXble them
ft:ves to view this fubjeA, under its various aG
pe&s; and they will have the fatisfadlion to be
furnifhed with the iieceQary data, to judge of the
ufefulnefsof this tranfadlion.
This work is principally distinguished by the
rlchncfs of the obferva'ions, Â»he pcrfpisuity of thÂ«
iÂ«caÂ«, and the modesty of the theory wh ; ch it
contains. t Pars, a man of wit observed, that
tbis work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with uJe: ul produce. It is addri f
fed to the unfcrtuiate La Favitte, in letters,
which fugitive so m, the author who could only
devote a few works to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although tircumjianc s aiÂ« ill many
refptfls different at the present day, from what
â¢hoy were in the year 1790, when these letters I
were written, yet it may be justly faid,that so ma
ny absolute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
fult of the author** remarks, it will serve to con
vince him that in all tranfa&inus, between free
nations, every thing may be expected from the ef
forts ef truth and juP.ice. .

wl ethei it can be better lurnilhed from France or
EnglaiKlâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would have allonifhcd a meie theorifl) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience These
kin of tableau*, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be desired, are the only fuie guides
the llatefman can take for th policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cannot too much adnnrc the apparent ex
attoefft of coJoocl Swan'* calculations ; and although
â¢the of Lord bhcfEeld have alieady been
coniradised by expeiirnce, and by feverai able pens,
yet it is curious to lee the author of ihe present work,
dispute with him the only grou d on which ht has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the icquiied condition, will he better able â 
than Gieat Britain to fypply us with fevoral articles, !
which the Englill) authoi allots enciufively and forev- }
cr to the latter; the author's tia/tiy ajfcfl on (\f he ;
has any) does n*Â»t appear to haste at, any time created
a partiality ofjudgment. Ihe refolt of this calculation
is that in Â«789, tÂ».at is to fay, ata period when arts
and manufactures did sot ptcfent in France the vdt
means and probability of extension which they now
pofTi.fi; th-t even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply oae
of any given aaantity of the produdions of France
and i ngtand united, butalfoto ciaer into competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to ihe wisdom of her government, and the industry
cf her inhabitants.

Proposals for Publishing
A new Commercial Work in the City of

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE Subscriber having been engag
ed in carrying on a publication in Boftcm
under the title of *he " s'ficn rrice Current, end
Marine Intelligencer j" a work, for utility and ex
tent of circulation, equal perhaps to any publica
tion et the kind in Europe or America, is now
induced to risque an attempt to publish a similar
paper under the patronage of the citizens of Phi
ladelphia. He makes tjie attempt from a persua
sion that a publication lor general benefit, and ex
tensive information, will receive as much support
from the libera! minds of thÂ« merchants and other*
ef this city, as places of le{Â» opulence in thÂ«"Uni
te:l States and although little immediate benefit
(hould iefuit to rhe citizens from such a publica
tion, yet it might prevent an idea aferoad which
some have induftriÂ«ufly circulated, that thf trade
of this extenfiv city was on the and con
rra&ed into so narrow a sphere that it would not
support a Price Cnrrent.
i he general anxiety that prevails in the com
mercial woild at this critical period, renders a
work 01 the kind particularly ufeful and nectary
i*Jor can the utility be doubted, when it is con-
I fidered how extenlive ihe trade and particularly
the insurance are affected in this city.â-A Â«arÂ»ful
publication of the failing and arrival of vefiels in
different parts of worldâadvice from vefiels
at ft a accidents happening in and out of port,-
are ever circumstances that ought to te known by
the merchant and underwriter, and one informa
tion of this kind may save more than the cost of a
hundred papers through life. The Editor engag
es to use his utmost endeavors to make it honora
ble and profitable to himfelf, fen fib le that it can
be done < nty by making it acceptable to his patron?.
