" First. If the hill passes into-a lav.*,, the two wa
companies of light dragoons willbe, from that mo- bu
ment, legally out of service, though they will after- wt
ie wards continue aÃxally in service ; and for their rc<
lc lervices during this interval, namely, from the time
_ of lcg?l to the time of aSual discharge, it will net 101
.be lawful to pay tH.em unless some future provisions th
be made by law. Though they may be discharged .
nt at the pleasure of Congrels, in justice they ought wl
to receive their pay, not ooly to the time of passing 11 '
the law, but ?t lead, to the tirÂ»c of thfii; aftuai fp

Secondly. It willbe inconvenient and injurious ar
to the public to dismiss the light dragoons, as soon di
as notice of the law can be conveyed to them, one
of.the companies having been lately destined to a hi
necessary and important service. P
Thirdly. The companies of light dragÂ«onÂ»,con- al

minister, accompanying it with these Words, " You
will there find anew confirmation of the principles [
from which the French people will never depart,
with regard to their gaod friends and allies the [
people of the United States of America. Yet
two days only had elapsed, before those principles [
â were departed from ; on the 28th of May, the
convention repealed their decree of the 23d. The
owners of a French privateer that had captured a [
very rich American (hip, the Laurens, found means
to effed the repeal, to enable them to keep hold
of their prize. They had even the apparent har
dintfs to fay before hand that the decree of the 23d
tvould be repealed.
The American minister again complained. Sol
on tke ift of July, the convention pafled a fourth [
deciee, again declaring, " That the vefTels of the
United Statesjare not comprised in the regulations [
of the decree of the ninth of May ; conformably to
the sixteenth [it should be called the twenty-third] ,
article of the ti easy concluded the 6th of February,
1778." The new minister for foreign affairs, M. {
_Desforgues, accompanies this new decree of July
1 ft, with the following exprefiion : " I am very
happy in being able to give you this new proof of
the fraternal sentiments of the Ftench people for
their allies, and of their determination to maintain
to the utmost $f their power the treaties subsisting
between the two Republics j" yet this decree pio
red as unliable as the former : on the 17th of July e
it was repealed.
The next decree on this fubjeft was that of the
joint committee of the 15th of November, 1794. F
already mentioned. Then followed the decree of 0
the committee of public fafety of the 4th of Janu- t:
ary, 1795 ('4 Nirsft, 3d year) repealing the sth 1
article in the decree of the 15th November prece
ding, and in effeft the articlts in the original de
cree of the 9th of May, 1793, by which the treaty
with the United States had been infringed. It is
not neceffrry for the Secretary to add, that the
decree of the 4th January, 1795, has been repeal,
pd by the decree of the Executive Diretftory of the
2d ot July, 1796, under colour of which are com
mitted the (hocking depredations on the commerce
of the United States which are daily exhibited in
the aewfpapers. The agents of the Executive Di
rectory to the le? ward islands (Leblanc, Sontho
nax, and the 17th of Noyembfr pas*
fed a decree, marked C, C.) for capturing all A
mcrican vessels bcund to or from British ports. The
feÂ«retary presumes this i 6 not an arbitrary, unautho- j
jrized aft of their own, but that it is conformable f
to the intentions of the executive dieftory; the 1
privateers of the French republic in Europe, hay
ing captured fom<? American vtffcls on the fame j
pretence ; and the consul of the republic at Cadiz
bavin; explicitly avowed his determination to con
rdemn American vefTels on that ground, pleidjng 1
the decree of the Direftory for his authority. '
The fecretaty has already intimated that the der J
cree of the 15th November 1794, was not follow
ed by the extensively good effedis expeAed from ]
it. By a communication from Mr, Skipwith, of 1
the loth of lad September (the latest conrimunica 1
tion from him, in answer to the secretary's tequeft 1
for information) it appears that the claims for de
tention of 103 American vefTels by the embargo at ,
Bourdeaux remained undetermined : fro funds hav
ing been appropriated for the payment of them ; |
and. tnat none of the hills dtawn by the colonial ad
ministration in the Weft lÂ»dies bad been paid to .
him ; the tre a fury having tendered payment in as
fignats at their nominal value, and afterwards in a- !
nether species of paper, called mandats, which had
fnffered a great depreciation even before they were
put into circulation j both of wliiÂ»h m / Jesof pay
ment were refufed to be accepted. The progress
made by Mr. Skipwith in the adjuftineft of other
claims, so far as known to the fectetary, will up.
peai in the annexed Jatement [D.J copies of which
were tranfmi'ted ten months ago to the officers of
the principal collectors of the customs, from the
department of state, for the information of our
mercantile citizens.
That nothing might be lefj undone which could
be accomplished by the executive, the attention of
Pinckney, the present miniller of the United 1
JStates to France, was particularly directed to the
fubjedt of these claims ; but the interval which has
elapsed since his departure, hss liot admitted of any
in'ereftipg communication from him on this bufi
,nefs.
In connexion with other fp illations by French
atmcd vefTels, the secretary intended to mention
those cwrotnitted under a decree, dated the flrft of
Auguff 17.96, ifToed by Vidor Hugues and Le
bas, the special agents of the executive dire&ory to
the windward iflrnds, declaring all veffcls loa-'ed
with coutraband sirticles of any kind, liable to fei
*ure and confiscation with their entire cargoes ;
without making any discrimination fn favour of
those which might be bound to neutral, or even to
French ports. This decree has been enforced a
jraiaft the American trade without any regard to
the eftabliftied farms of legal proceedings, as will
appear from the annexed deposition [Ej of Jofiah
Hcmpftead, matter of the brigantine Patty ef Wea
thersiield, a copy of the decree marked [F] is also
annexed.
The fcctetary has received a printed copy of a
nother decree of the fame fpeaial agents to the
windward islands, dated the 13th Pluvsife, sth
year, answering to February ift, 1797, authoring
the capture of all neutral vefTels destined to any or j
the windward or leeward Islands, in America,
which have been deliwred up te the Esglifh, and
occupied or defended by emigrants, ramlng Marrii y
niqae, St. Lucie, Tobag<> Dematara, Berbice, and d
Efequibo ; and to leeward, Port-aJ-Prince, St. t
Marc, L'Archaye, and Jeremie ; declaringvfuch t
vefTels and their cargoes to be good prize, as well
as all vefTels cleared out vaguely for the Well In- f
dies, a copy of this last decree, will be added to t
this Teport as soon aj it shall be translated. All h

bore away before the wind for Bengal. ]

On Thursday morning the 13th Nov. the Port- 1
land Packet failed from Dominica, for Antigua, ia 1
corrpany with the Neptune brijj, and Atalants '
fchopner. Ort Friday the 14th, frll in. with and | 1
fpofce hismajefty's ship EapÂ«'iÂ»g, company wi:h 1
the Mermaid and Laurel frigates ; as it was quite 1
-calm, and but little appearance of a breexe, captain
Taylor went op board the J .zpwing ta request she
would convoy us clear of Guadeloupe, being then 1
within fix leagues of BafTcterre, and having much
reason to apprehend that some of the French priva
teers might come out, and availing themselves of the 1
falsi, attack the packet:âthe captain of the Lap. i
wing told him, he could not confidently with his
etders, convoy or grant us either of the other sri- 1
gates for that pwrpefe, but that he would |ieep be
tween us and the land, by way of pro-e&ian, at the
fame timr he juforraed us, that there were then in
Basseterre, three large frigates, two corvettes, a
brig, cuttpr, and feycral privatfcnâthe next day
we found oyifclves within about four leagues of .
BafTcterre, and not one of the frigates or any other
eiuifer in fight.âThe enemy did not, however, to
our furptife, fend out any tlijng agjinft us. On 1
Sunday the 16th mft.faw a 1 ifrge (hip close in with
the ha.il, under which we were (jlill becalmed, and <
at the fame tim* saw a ft range fail bearing down on
the Atalanta (chooner, wiikh proved so be a French
privaieer, full bf men, and yvould certainly have
taken the schooner, had not the large ship under the
land hove in fijht, upon which vyÂ® immediately
bore awayâa light breeze lpringing up, the (hip
which we then perceived was evidently a ship of war
gave ms chafe, (hewed no colours, and about 8
o'clock at night caice up wi'h, and fired a (hot at
us, upon which wÂ« dire&ly hove too and hoisted
our slagâshe then yawed up clufe on our bow, and
fired feveralfhot at us, through our rigging and our
fore-topfuil, upon which we instantly hauled down
our colours, and she sent her boat on board, when
to our great aftoniihment we found it was his Majes
ty's ship Thunderer, instead of an enemy, as we had
evety reafi'it) to suppose. '
Upon his demanding why we did not hoist the
packet signal, Capt. Taylor informed him that the
captain of the Lapwing had particulatly cautioned
him against doing so under the land, as the signals
were well known to the French on shore, besides
that h' - had supposed from hi# coming out so close
from under the land, and (hewing no colours, that he
was one of the French (hips of war. The next day
about three o'clock in the afternoon, being then
becalmed about three leagues off the north end of
Guadaloupe, and 110 Eiiglifh cruiser whatever in
fight,'we descried a schooner coming out from
the land, and bearing down faft upon us, âby 6
o'clock ftie had neared us so much, at to eDable us
to discover that th.e was full of men, and had about
30 sweeps outâa light breeze fpringtng up, we
tacked and bore away towards Montferrat, to get
rid of the shore, and she still followed, every now
and then edging down towards u$ to reconnoitre,
and so on duting the whole night.
On Tijefday morning the 18th, at day ligiit, be
ing then about 6 leagues from Montferrat, the
schooner that had been watching us all night, edged
down gradually upon us, and captain Taylor then
evidently perceived tliÂ»t (he was a large French pri
vateer, got ?ll ready for aAion, requeflin-g the geh
tlemen passengers on board, who a<Sea| as marines
on the quarter deck, and the men to conceal them
selves, ib order that /he might not observe our force
until she came along pdeâabout 7 o'clock, she be
ing then within a mulket (hot upon our (larboard
quarter, we hoisted our colours and gave her a gun,
upon which she hoisted the national and the bloody
flags on her maiiij and gave us a broadside ; after
exehanging a few more (hot from the great guns,
he refoiutely bore down, and hauling up close under!
our Hern, laid herfelf on our larboard quarter, and
made a most desperate attempt to board t weinftant
â¢ ly lashed her bowsprit to oar main (hrouds, and fe
â¢ cured her fore rigging to our mizeu, and a steady
1 and well directed fire of mufquetry was opened up
on them, while they were attempting to force them
Â» selves into the quarter gallery and cabin windows,
f and up the netting. In this situation, locked to
- gether for about 50 minutes, every effort was made
c with the utmost determination 00 both fides, they
even throw'ng their j. f/lols, after firing them, at guf
lieadi, and polling us with round liiot. Fortunately
we being covered by qur quarters, and they beinjr
entirely expof<*d, gave us the moll decifivc advan
tage, insomuch that her deck was ftrew'cJ frqm jletn
to stern with the bodigj of tbeii killed and
when they llruck their colours, whi< h was done at
the inftqnt yye were flipping doiyn the fidcato board

in all refpefts completely provided ahd cquipped-r
---fhe was commanded by one Piere Toulon, and had
on board 68 fighting men, out qf which i I were
killed, and 29 wounded, the greater part mortally ;
she was reckoned by far the faflelt failef from Gua
daloupe, and would certainly have got away wit'll
the greatest ease, had not the precaution, at firll ta
ken, of fecaring her, prevented her so doingâon
our part it is with the mod poignant grief, we have
to relate the deaths of Capt. Taylor, and Mr. Sa
muel Cunningham of St. Vincent's, who were the
only two killed in the adlionâthe captain received,
ii( the very foment of vidory, a muflcet ballthro'ii
the heart while exhorting to conquest, and exhibit
ing htrnfelf the foremofl and most heroic example
âstrange likewise to tell, we have but two' wound
ed, one of whom was capt. Maxwell of the 93d
regiment, (lightly on the knee. We have carried
her jntp Montferrat, where it is needles* to add,
that the utmeft attention and Iwminity were (hewn
to the wounded, and the bodies of our dead inter
