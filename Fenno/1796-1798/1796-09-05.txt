A very valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY-, and sundry STONE
QUARRIES to be let.
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
towmac, for any term not less than l'even, nor more than
eleven years, frohi the firft day of September next. The
mill-house is 41 by 40. feet, three stories high, built with
stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two
overshot iS feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necelTary for
carrying on the business with dispatch, and at as little ex
penfc as pofiible, all ill good orderâFrom the mill to my
landing on she I?Â«ltomac river, (wherecraft, of any bur
then maydeiiver grain and take in flour) it is about 40
yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and
the City of Walhington, about 3 miles, and to Alexan
dria .'.bcnit 11 m:!< 'lili- fif-.in* ,t>n, aitied by a fttf&eienl
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8
tp 1 o miles less than to any market town upan the navi
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the premises a
lai*ge stone Coopers' Hup, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing aforefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for
wardnefs and probably will be finilhed the ensuing fall.
There are also on the premises, a Brewery and Diftillc
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or toilers, with every necelTary articlc, all new, and in
good order, and fufficiently large to carry 011 the Brew
ery and Distillery upon a Very c&tenfive plan. This prop
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my laads adjoining the premises, ?nd along the
banks of the river, where craft may lead with ease and dis
patch, is an inmenfe quantity of building and lounda
-1 tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
more may be opened with ease : the stone taken frqm these
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
separately or together a? may btft suit.
On the top of the hill, and about zoo yards from the
mill, isÂ« stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac
commodation of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, fmokt
houfe, &c. and a garden, enclcfed and in cultivation, the 1
foiof which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I
will also lent this property.
Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's
(hop, ii) which is a complete fct of Blaekfmith's tools,
which I will also rent, and if agreeable I Will hire to the
tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete
workman.
If I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpofc of carrying ftor.e : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
1 potfeflion will be given, l'or terms apply to the fubferib
er in this town.
The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurten
ances, will be dejiverad to the tenant or tenants in good
repair,'and must be so returned, at the expiration of the

THE publisher thinks it a mark of refpeift, due to a
liberal and enlightened public, to inform them that
this is the Poem for the publilhing of which he has been
twice dragged fr6m hishoufe, and is bow laboring under
a vexatious profccutionr~He is confciotre that the piece
contains nothing either criminal or offenfive, unless ori
ginal wit, decorated in elegant language, be criminal or '
dlfguftiilg to the prevalent taste ; and, as he trusts that
neither of these is the cafe, he submits the work to the
public with a full assurance of its meeting with a favora- >
ble reception.
He would beg his prosecutors to call to mind (if they 1
have ever read it) the following apolcrgue to a well known
romanceâ" A young painter, indulging a vein of plea- 1
fantry, (fetched a kind of ConDerfatian Piece, refpefling a
bear, an o\*l, a Vionkey, and an ass; and to render it
more striking, humourous, and moral, distinguished eve
ry figure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was
txhibited in the garb and attitude of an old, toothless,
drunken soldier ; the owl perched upon the handle of a
coffee-pot, with fpe&acles on his no'fc, seemed to contem
plate a newfpapcr; and the ass ornamented with a huge
tye-wig (which, however, could not conceal his long .
ears) fat for his picture to the monkey, who appeared
with the implements of painting. This ivhmftcal group
afforded some mirth, and met with general approbation, 1
until some mischievous wag hinted the whole was a lam- '
poon upon an old officer, a physician, and a member of :
Parliament; an insinuation which was no l'eoner circulat- '
ed, than these pnople began to be alarmed, and even to 1
fancy thcmfelves fignified by the several figures in the '
piece. The furious group fell upon the A painter, who dc- '
clared that he had no design to give offence, or to cha- '
ratfterize particular petfons. They affirmed, the refenthlance '
â¢was M palpable to be overlouked,âand their clamours being 1
overhear* by the public, the Captain was a bear, the :
Do<3ot an -fs, and the Senator air owl, to their dying '
day."- l#*a similar fate should attend the persons who j
will infill upon being the members of this group, the 1
public will do the publisher the justice to remember that
it is no fault of his. t

ROYAL ANECtiOTE. |
During the Royal residence at Cheltenham, it i
was remarked, by the keepers of the fevetal turn
| pike gates, that his majesty in his Ihort cxcurfions* '
paid no toll. The right of his Majesty to pass toll- '
, free happening to become the fubjfft of converia
: hon in Â«a large company at Worcester, Robert
t bleth, an honest blunt fellow, ? nd keepei of Bar
i ba " S ate > urged that his majesty, in his '
â¢ P nvate "pac.ty, was liable to the toll, declaring, at '
, the lame time, that though he> refpeded his fove
-1 vcifr ever he came to Barban gate, he Ihould not
: pass till the toll was paid.
A short lime after, honest Robert's resolution 1
was P ut to the tell, for his majesty, in his route to ]
Worcester, came to Barbau gate. On the ar.ival
r of the firft horseman that preceded the royal car
riage, Robert having prcvioufiy locked the gate, 1
flood with the keys in his hand, and demanded the 1
toll. I he: Equerry, man accent of perturbed I
patience, said, "Open the gate iaftantly, for his '
mffjefty is at hand."â 1 " I know that," replied 1
Rooert, out his majesty is not at the head of an ar-' !
P.y, and mud pay the toll. The servant remon- 1
trated with threats and indignation, but Robert
was not to be frightened; he heard him_Â«uh- pla

Drouet eftabhfhed an i/ifurredionalcommittee; in
like manner, our democrats have their infurre&ioii.!
clubs. The French plotters pretended to be exctw
foe patriots. This is the very character afl'umed
by the prlrty in Bache's, Grecnleaf's, and Adams's
anarchical papersâwho forgets the changes thev
' have rung upon the words patriotic party, I alandi

rather more fatety to their precious necks.
Simple democracy is certainly going into disgrace
in France and America. Let it go. A fingieaf

republican principles of a divided legislature. Re.

It is with pleasure weobferve that the ufeof Oxen
in lies of Horses, for the common purposes of farming
and for draught, is daily becoming more prevalent
throughout the state.
One drover lately brought down near three hundred
head of cattle in one drove to the vicinityÂ«of this city,
from the weiterh parts of the state, which he very focn
tliffiofed ofâA large proportion of these were fleers.
The advantage which the use of Ojten gives over
Horses, consists in the following particulars ;
They require less feed,
Will perforin more labour,
Make better manure,
And, When they have become so old as to be unfit
fotj fcrvice, will fell for (laughter, and bring a confi
scable proportion of their original cost â¢ A Horse,
on the contrary, when worn out, is good for nothing.
The rontinuance of the very high prices of all kinds

such a dpgree, that there is no doubt we should have been
fcrcoght to a state of starvation had not the couiltry been

ARMED NEUTRALITY
A junction of the Swedish and Danish Grand
ftetits, took place early in June, and they immedi
ately proceeded on a cruize into the North Seas, to
protest their commerce from being diflurbed by
the cruizers of the warrinjj nations. These power
ful neutrals have been almost as frequeistly damaged
by the tyrants of the oÂ«ean as America. Our na
vigation is now tolerably secure, thanks to negocia-.
tionâand they are obliged to equip a large and
expensive fleet, sot the prote&ion of their's.
This remark, however, is only good as it rcfpeifts
English cruizers. The French indeed,. have com
menced a partial boftility on our vessels : but this
it more to be attributed to the advice of some of
our " Patriots," than any bad disposition

from Gibraltar, we lparn, that the Emperor of Mo
rocco, has issued orders for the capture of all ves
sels bound to the ports possessed by hi? revolted
brother, under the appellation of enemy's ports.
Under these order?, a Dane, a Swede, a Portu
guese, and an American, have been taken. The*.,'
latter was tl\e brig Emmeline, Prentifs, of Boston :

cleared, in coHfideration of their failing previous to :

FROM SURINAM.
Capt. Stover, from Surinam, "which he left
Aug. 2, infotms, that two English frigates lay at
ihe giouth of the river, in fight of the Dutch
(qriadron, at New-Fort. The Dutch Admiral ;
brought <Ajt with him Danish regiflers, for the
.â¦nerchzntmen at that place ; the English knowing
this, capture all veffelg,under Daniffr colours ; yet 1
norwithftanding the certainty of being taken by 1
the frigates below, these merchantmen are sent out <
daily, captured, and sent to Demarara. Five fai} ]
weTe captured one day in fight of a Dutch frigate
which lay down the river. The admiral is fiifpcÂ£l
ed of connivance at these captures. ( Tbe English
are expc&ed to take pofi'tfiion of-Stirir.am, arid it -
is .thought little lefiftance would he made. Capt. 1
Stover believes neither British king's ships, nor Bef 1
oiudian privateers, molest Ameiican vtflels at pre
sent ; as he was very nsar such vefftis on his home- 1
wsrd .bound passage. Markets were exceeding low-

said, that the ftiip Eliza had been a prize to the.

two continued vfoeir course to the westward, and ;
I passed us about a mile ahead, without sheWing co

â  a signal made by one ot the two, and the ftiip to
the northward immediately tacked .and flood 'after

: fiance about twelve leagues, tlje ships shaped their
â  course for us, but on some guns firing, which we
took to be near the Chesapeake, two of the largest
ships tacked and flood for that placeâthe other,
which appealed to be a sloop of war, continued
her course for us, but about 9, 011 a signal made
1 from the other /hips, she tacked and flood for them,
1 an(l about l J o'clock they were out of fight, at 12
we discovered them standing to the east ward under

chafe, which continued until about 5 o'clock, when
one of the ships coming up with one of the ships
t ihafed, an atlion commenced, which lasted but a
1 few minittes, and as Coon as the fmoak cleared away,

volume of his American Geography, of which we
gave'a fpccimeh lately under tffe article, Salem.
This i y elligent and ingenious inquirer into the
1 history of our country has considered his work as
the continuation of Bufching, whose work com
prehending the Geography of Eurppe is in eleven
volumes in the last edition, ProfefFdr Ebeling gives
in his firft volume New-Hampshire and Maflachu
fetts ; in Uia fecotrd, Rhcide-Ifland, Connecticut,
Vermont, and New-York ; in the third, he conti
nues New-York and New-Jtrfey. He laÂ» been
careful to collect the bell authorities, and has had
great success. A French tranllation is bow print
ing at Paris, and we hope that an American transla
tion will not be forgotten. The plan of Bufehing
has not been fallowed by any works we now have,
and it so well unites the statistical accounts with
the geography and local divifiohs, including all the
works known either as " States of Countries, Geo- "
'â  'â  graphies, or Gazetteers," as to demand a prefer
ence. The edition of Paris will have several cor
