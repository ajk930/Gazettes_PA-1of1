For the Gazelle of the United States. pel
No. I. lat
MR. TlttNO,
Tt has often been said, that the depreda
tions committed by the French, upon the
commerce of the citizens of the United i
Statei, originated in the conduft -of the I
French part izans in the United States, and '
of thoft who had gone from hence toFrance, '
that it was jtiftified by theirâthat it was
jipheld by themâand that they rejoiced in
the fufferings of those of their countrymen,
â¢who did not approbate the measures adopted
by the French towards this country. This
assertion has not rested on probability âit
wat not founded upon inference! deduced jjj
from affumcd predicatesâi,t was not advanc " I OV<
ed as an opinion, fupporttd merely upon car
the suspicious bafii of logical induftion it
hag frequentlybeen substantiated by evidence
which nothmgbut the hardihood of unfl<nch- Jn(
ing jacobins can deny. By them it has fo<
been denied. By them it is ft'll denied. car
and by them it will continue to be denied, 10
with that undeviating exa&nefs with which
they deny every thing, which militates a- f rc
gaiufl their mod favorite wiflies, however ft r
notorious its evidence may fee, however va- no
luable it nr>ay be in itfelf, or however im- â¢
portant it may be in its necessary confequenc-
es, when connefted with the public interest. to
Not with (landing the testimony which has M
been often adduced, is fr.fficient to convince go
any mind susceptible of convi&ion, it may
not be amiss to bring into view evidence of hij
the faÂ£k, more indisputable, if peflible, than re ,
any which has preceededâwhich evidence be
has happily been furnifhed by Mr. Monroe, n'Â«
the immaculate envoy of the French parti-
Â«ans. He hasfhewn himfelf worthy of their
confidence, and he has proved himfelf faith- w
ful to their iutereft. â¢
The duty of an ambassador is too well p'
understood by my countrymen, to require a
dsinute definition. Suffice it to observe here, r
that it is his indispensable duty to follow the hi
jnftru&ions with whi>h he is furnifhed, by w
the government which he reprtfents. If re
his inftru'tions are Specific, so far as he con- j*
forms to them he is to be juftified ; so far as w
he deviates from them, he is refpoiifible for j
heconfequeneesâunlcfs a perfeft adherence G
to them, in the experiment, i 3 found impos
sible; and unlcfs, in such a cafe, he is au *
orifed to exercise his own discretion. The
latter, however, appears not to have been t
the lit uit ion of Mr. Monroe, if we may
give cr d;t to his own statement. His in
ftruflions were Specific, and we shall now fee
with wh't fidelity he complied with them.
When Mr. Monroe set out for Fiance,
as Minister from the United States, he was
inftruÂ£ted tajinfift 011 the on the
part of the French government, the
twenty third, and twenty fourth articles of 1
the treaty subsisting between the two gov- , <
ernments, which articles had been violated *
by the French. That thcviolation had tak-
.en place was the opinion of the President ,
of the United States, or he would never t
have issued foch inJlruSiotis to Mr. Monroe. <
Should any ptrfon fay his inftraftions did '
not refer to those articles, 1 will enquire, <
were not the injuries, of which he was in
ftrnfted to complain, .committed in violation (
of those articles? And is it not under fane- ,
tion of those articles, that the French have !
upheld the perpetration of that series of '
piracy, ever since the completion of the
treaty between this government, and the |
rourt of St. James's; which piracy begun
long before the treaty last: mentioned was e
ver heard of. Is it not under the fame fee
ble fubterfuge that their partizans in our na
tional Legislature, hide ihemftlves, notwith- ;
(landing its absurdity, when they efponfe
the French cause, in jaftification of them
against the complaints of our government ?
That the French had violated the treaty, i.e.
those articles of it, was the opinion of Mer
lin, Thuriot and Treilhard, or they would
not have urged Mr. Monroe to declare whe
ther he was inftruÂ£led to demand, or iijijl
ou their fulfilment of the treaty, in an au
dience which they had with Mr. Monroeâ
which they did, as appears from Mr. Mon
roe's own ttatement. If it had not been
Mr. Monroe's opinion that the treaty had
been violated by the French, he never would
have replied to the committee who held their
audience with him, as he did, viz. " that
he well know, that, if upon experience it
ihould prove that the departure from the
treaty (hould be found to produce any solid
advantage to the republic, it would not on
ly, be submitted to with paticme, but with
pleasure, by the government, and the peo
ple of the United States."
To enlarge, by commenting upon such
conduct, would be to \yeakcn the evidence
which it conveys to the mind of au honed
man. It is so barefaced that a jacobin mult
command an unusual (hare of effrontrry, e
Â»en for one of them, to gainsay it. I ques
tion, whether, even Mr. Nicholas, with all
his facility at mis-dating faÂ£ts, and evasion
of truth, could get aside of this, and re
tain the femblanee of plausible confi lency,
even with his own party. And if Mr. Ni
cholas is uneqnal to the effort, Mr. Gallatin
tnuft (hrink from it; since the deliberate fo
phiftiy of a Jefnite will furcly make but a
feeble opposition to truth, with enlightened
judges, where the vociferous dogmatism of
a sanguineous demagogue proves inadequate.
After this statement, fir, your readers
will not hesitate with refpeil to the fidelity
of Mr. M*nrot in the execution of his mil-
Con. They will fee, in him, exemplified
the fidelity of every French partizan, in
Conriefs, and out. In him is exemplified
the Feelings of them all; the patriotism oT
them allâthe principle* of thera allâthe
arguments of them allâthe integrity of
them allâand the art of them allâfor they
all jullify him. Now, fir, if he was difhoa- hÂ»j
eft and treacherous to his country, they all * !l
fall under the fame condemnation, since they
c*n now, approbate his cendudt during his
mission to France. But to this conduit of
Mr. MoÃroe, and those who juftify him, rai
the friends of our government attribute the tha
evils which have ruined their individual prof- "i
perity, and which now threaten the ann.hi- '
lation of our government. j,

On T hnrfday niorniag last, I went into tfce HaU w _
a little btfsre eleven o'clock. After prayer-were
over, Mr. Grifwold cam# into the hall, with a *â¢
cane in hia hand. He wcnÂ» and set his cane up 11
near the window by the north weft part of the
hall, and fat down nÂ«ar the end cÂ£ thÂ«. Teat next "P
the floor, and took out a letter (aj 1 supposed) * '
and went to readiog it. W1 ilft he was reading, an
soon after Mr. Lyon canse into the house with a his
cane in his hand, went and took bis feat, and wÂ«-nt L)
'to writing, setting his cane befiftehim. I looked Gi
at Mr.Grifwold, and thought he did not fee fc<
or ohftrve Mr Lyon. I then tr.rned my eye off no
from them, and spoke to a'gcntleraan who was a j u
ftracger to them both, and said they wire both a
now in the house, turned my face towards them, w j
and saw Mr Grifwold tken with his cane up, right na
before Mr. Lyon, and he ftrKck him a blow across
his (Mr. I.yon's) (houlder. Mr. Lyon appeared f f)
to be ahoot half way between fitting and {landing. of(
Mr. Grifwold repeated the blow Mr. Lyonfocn
got rut on the of the hall, and made several
attempts to get hold of Mr. Grifwold, but he fail- j
ed ii. his attempts, as Mr. Grifwold kept oal{ of
his reach, and continued the blows until Mr. Lyon ,
retreated behind the fpÂ«raker's chair. The mem- c
Â» hers then huddled round them so thick faw
I no more of ihe tranfaiSion, until they were fepar
ned ; alter whi.h, Mr. Grfwold came acrcf. the
floor of the hall, and went through the parage by
[ the doer at which we enter the hall, and went
without the bar to ihe south east end of the hall,
I drank some water When (landing near the

I in hi* hand, Mr. Lyon came through the floor of

when he sprang, as I thought, tq get out of the
his flick, but Mr. Lyon struck Mr. Grif-
I wold an his arm and fticulder, asl thought flight-
I ly. Mr.Grifwold then turned upon Mr Lyon,
1 when the doorkeeper sprang in between them.
I The speaker then called the honfe tÂ« order, Mr.

twhich Mr. Grif-jjo.d mad; upon Mr. Lyon, in F

the istb day us February, 1758. a
I The haur at which the honfe were to meet, f
' I according to adjournment 011 the the preceding
I day, was eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and I
I went into rhe lull a little before this hour. â 3
! Some fhoit time after eleven o'clock, the house '
I attended en prayer. After this was over, 1 was Â«
I walking in the feuth end of the hall without j
' I the bar, and saw Mr. Lyon come in, with his {
, I cloak on, and go to his feat, u hich is the fourth j
I Ifr m the end of that front iow of feats which is j
I on the left fide of the pafTage leading up to the
' I speaker's chair. I saw him pull oti'his cloak 1
lindtakehiffe.it, and perceived that he had a '
1 I ("mall cane in his hand, which he either put be- I
" I :weÂ«n his legs, or leaned agsinft a chair beside j
- I him, in such manner that the end of it was un- j
f I der the long desk that was before him. After j
. Ihe fat down, he appeared to be engaged either
g in writing or in reading the papers that were
I before him. It was then about half past eleven,
I and the speaker was lilting in his*chair, but had
not called the house to ordtr, an! I then taw 1
Mr Grifwold coming from the north end of the 1
- I ball across the aiea in front of the speaker's
- 1 c hair, with a large yellow hickory cane in his
e I hand. Although I was looking that way, as I
1 I was walk at, I did not notice him much until
j I e came within about fix or eight feet of Mr.
' I Lyon. He was then walking atrol's the floor in
â¢ I . fidclong manner towards Mr. Lyon, and Mr.
â¢ I Lyon was fitting with his face down, looking
I I >a his papers, and as I prefuraedid not pecceive
I he approach of Mr. G ifwold, and if my rae
-1 I T>ry serves me right, I think hi was fitting
I -vith his hat on. As soon as Mr Grifwold had
I one in front of Mr. Lyon, he struck him with
I ,11 his force over his head and shoulders, with
I 'he smallest end Â»f is hickory cane, repeating
'â¢ I Sis blows as fall as poflible. <Vr. Lyon, I t!/Ink,
1 I cceiyed three blows in this potture, before he
I oft to disengage himfelf fram the desk that
r I vss before him, and the chairs that were on
t I ich fide of him- He appeared lo be then try-
I ng to recover his cine which was under hiÂ»
1 I left, but could not do it by reason of tte vio
â¢, I ence of Mr. GriTwold's blows over his head and
d I houlders. He then rose from his feat, and got
- I .'iitat the end of the desk, defending himfelf
f, I Â»ith his arms against the blows of Mr. Grif-
I * old, and then rushed towards Mi. Grifwold,
I ind Mr. Grifwold retreated towsrds thefront of
I'he chair, and andeavoured to keep Mr. Ly
" I >n at a diftanec from hiw>, that lie might ftr ike
e .im more conveniently with his cane. There
(I I was no person fitting on the fame row of feats
ft I 'vith Mr. Lyon when this aflault began. The
e _ |: eaker was in-his chair j and as f< on as the af
j- I f uli commsnced, I expelled he would cry out
I order with a loud voice, but he did not. Lwas
1 I induced to ftippofe this, because I always under
in I ">iiod thst the rule of the house gave the Speak
e- I er a right to call the members to order after
f, I the hour to which the house flood adjourned,
I although there might not be a fufiicient number
j n of members present to proceed to hufmefs.
Mr. Lyon then retreated round the clerk',
table,'ht right hand of thr speaker's ch lir, and
a Mr Grifwold (fill ptiriued him. then
:Â£ 1 went into the narrow palTage which is between
of the wall of the house and the foeaker's chair,
e. and I then heard a rattling naife as if it were
, rl made with a pair as tongs, hat could not fee the
t panics because the speaker's chair was in the
I way, and I was m>fetf then pading in front of
' " the chair, teeomeup to the parties engaged, as
_ theynuigl.t go through the paffige on the left
in hand fidT of the chair. As soon as they had got'
icd through the paflage, Mr. Grifwold either push
of ed .Mr. Lyon do*n on hit hack in the north
weft terser of the area by his own flrength, or
Mr. I.yon stumbled backwards over some chairs

that he had ahlack eye. 1 then seized htild of be
Mr. GrifwÂ«ld'> left leg to pull him away fiom J| ol
Mr. Lyon, and another member, whom I after- are
wards noticed to be my colleague, Mr. Elinen- cq|
dors, seized at the fame time hold of Mr. Grif- . ,
wold's right leg with the fame view. As soon '
as we had done this, Mr. Speaker cried out to be'
me and said, " That it not a proper way to take J wh
hold of him j" I afted him why ? he replied, to
11 You ought to take hold of him by the ftould- J)|
erÂ» j" I said it would not hurt him to pull him w ~
a foot or two on the carpet. \Ve tlim in this
marner pulled Mr. Grifwold from ofi Mr. Ly
on, and by this time a number of other mem- an
berÂ» had gathered round, and.the affray appear- pfi
ed to be ' vcr. 1 then walked back 10 ihclonth. luj

was drinking, when Mr. Lyon parted by me
with his small cane in his hand, anil wenr to ou

foor as Mr. Lyon had drunk a little, he lorked of
up, and j;ereeiving that it was Mr. Grilwuld co
w hoftood close by him, he said, " Is it you ?"
and flruck at him with h'ts cane, and hit him on
his left (houlder or cheek. 1 ohferved that Mr.
Lyon's blow was but a'feeble one, and Mr. J* 1 '
Grifwold then retreated from him fix or eight bu
feet, and I then noticed that Mr. Gntwo'ui had th
no cane in his hand. I then saw Mr. Si'greaves <Ji'

a large hickory cane, and padiog by Mr. Lyon tu
with a good deal of animation in bis counte

Mr. Lyon then put himfelt in a poflure cf de- 'b
fence, and said " Come 011 " 1 then cried out tii
order, and Mr. Thompson, from New-Jersey, th
thin stepping up, and looking me full in the be

I would have no more fighting here. Mr. Grif

BRITISH PARLIAMENT.
* a
HOUSE of COMMONS.
Thursday, December.
(Conclup.on of Mr, Fox's Speech.) t
By every amount which I have been a- ;
ble to colleft ; by the report of every per- t
son whom I have seen ; and by the whole t
tenor of the meetings of my constituents, r
I find that men of all descriptions, and f
whatever be their party feelings, unite in j
ahhorrence of the principle and tendency t
of this bill. Ttiey all objeft to the princi- Â»
pie, because the assessed taxes are not mere- ,
r ly an unjust criterion of wealth, but the word ,
and most fallacious that could be devised j
for in every, part of this metropolis, so fa- (
tal has been the disastrous war in which we .
are involved, that the afieffed taxes are now .
with the greatest difficulty collefted. They |
1 are either in atrear, or postponed, or the (
goods'of the unhappy persons are regular- j
â¢ ly diftrainecf, and they all unite in declar- j
I ing, not merely againfl the inexpediency,
| but againfl the total imprafticability of for- ]
cing the receipt. This is not the opinion
! of one diftriÂ£l, or of one party, but it is
the general opinion of every party of the
f people who have had time to examine the
" provisions of the bill; and really it will
r be a lingular thing, if the house should op
pose thtmfelves to the universal voice of the
t kingdom. Gentlemen seem to forget that
i we affÂ«Â£l at leall to call ourfelvet reprefenta
' tives of the people. I know that we are
e no such thing, but we affect to call ourselves
' so. Yet in this house only fifteen gentle-
J men could be found to vote again(t a mea
j fare upon which out of that house, there
was not merely a majority, but an unanim
n ity of disTent ; ministers, in this instance,
'â¢ cannot plead their usual fubterfuge, that it
? is the mere cry of a party. It is no such
e thing. Unanimous disapprobation has come
from the most extraordinery placet. Even
j the common council has been unanimous.
Ii There are but two forts of reprcfentation,
b adtual and virtual. You cannot pretend to
S call yourselves the adtual representatives of
' the people, but you fay you are the virtual
e âprove yourselves so then, by obeying their
n united voice. I hope and trust that you
.. will come round, and (hew yourselves in
is some degree entitled to the name of virtual
1- representatives. I will fairly tell you, that
even if you were to do so, I (hould not con-
II fider it as a fufficient proof that you are e
j- ven the true virtual rcprefeatatives of the
i people, unless I fee yo>i also sympathize
>f with the people. You must make common
r- caule with them. YOll must invite them to
â  e facrifices Jjy your own example. You must
rt lead the way. I remember an honorable
u member, now no mere, who had the hap
'j- C py art of mixing argument with pleasantry,
in a way that was never excelled, Mr.
ai Burke, illullrated this principle by a story
r- very much in pointâA French regiment,
' i * in speaking of an old Colonel whom they
er had loft, and of a new one that had suc
ceeded him, extolled the firft to the skiesâ
" what particular reason have you for your
,Â» t ardent affedtion for the old colonel, rather
nd than the new ?" said a person to them,
en â¢< We have 110 other reason, said they, than
rn t bisâthe old colonel always faidAllans
lr ' mes enfant 1" The new colonel fays, Â« Allex
mes enfans I' This was indeed a striking
c#ntra(l, and just in thil manner I aver we
of to aft towards the people. We ought
at not to fay to them "Go makefacriftes
eft Â«Â« Let us make facrifices." To rouse
? ot the energy of the people let uÂ» hear of the
facrifices of the Crown. It is from the
"or &%beft place that the example ought to be
Â»irs It will animate and cheer the heart
in of the kingdom i
;his " S lamrn miferujtnts bahuj/i laborum.''
When men arc called on to give up their tfa
pleasures, whatever Jthey may be, whether
of horses or gardens, it is but reasonable ror
that they should fee the crown participat- arn
ing in the facrifice.âBut when instead of j"* 1 '
this, we fee only that new patronage is to he
be obtained out of the fervii>Â£ of 14 mil- t,K
lions in this way, we mud feel that these P el
are bad symptoms, and that there is no wo
common cause in the exertions ve are cal- air
led upon to make, and we are made to be- dei
lieve that there is something ; n this war, bet
which makes it unfit for all such examples nei
to be given. An honorable gentleman (Mr. ha
Dundas) fays on account of this taxâ it in
will only change handsâgreat Turns will be D'
wanted, he fays, to clothe and maintain the ml
army. I wilh the house to remark thf tx- Â» n
preflionâl certainly believe himâgreat ex
funis will go to the army. But is that any n0
confutation to nie ? If 2001. is to be taken
! out of my pocket, what care Ito whom it an
is to be paid ? But this very argument is, mi
and csught to be an objedt of just and feri- by
ous alarm to the nation ; âfor while these tei
enormous sums arc to be paid into the hands a 1
of government, it becomes almost the sole PÂ°
consumer. Let us examine the fadt. One P r
tenth of the expenditure of the whole king- mi
dom is estimated at seven millions. That r
makes the total expenditure seventy millions; bs
but perhaps, at this is not the just test, and a"
that there may be evasion, the total expen
diture may be 10c,0c0,0001. On this â¢
ground it appears that the public expendi- Â°Â»
ture has been between 30 and 40,000,0001. th
a year daring' this war. 'lf then it be true c '
that the expenses of the war are so efTen- Pj
tial to revenue, what a profpedt for us when P'
this source of revenue lhall be cut off! The "
honorable gentleman in speaking of a pledge, 'F
is extremely desirous of overlooking and n<
explaining away his own. He is not will- "J
ing to remember the emphatical pledge that
he gave, never to make peace with ''
the jacobin government of France. What
can we expeft from men who have through tl
the whole of the war shrunk from e*ery
pledge they hare ever given ? It is only by 11
their removal that the nation can be saved
from its present perilous (ItHation. They
are either fools or hypocrites who attempt Â°
to separate ministers from their naeafures, or
affefl to think that our affairs can be retriev-
ed in their hands. Th* country ' must 1
take its fate, if they are so dull of intelleft, 1
as to conceive that they can be rescued from F
their present situation by the imbecility that 0
brought them into it. We are called upon
to make this dreadful facrifice in order to '
terrify France ! We are to give 7,000,000 c
in one year, in addition to all our other bur- 1
thens, to (hew- that we have what '
their poets call I'smbarras des richejfes.â l er
> rify France ? What, by (hewing that we are J
1 forced to abandon the funded system, which
' has supported us through so many difScul- 1
' ties, because we dare no longer perfifl in it ? '
" Terrify Franceâby an cxadtion which fliall '
not be paidâwhieh will convulse the coun-
try from one end to the otherâor which,
" if it were pofiible to harbor the frantic idea
of its poflibility, would certainly paralyse
e all our future operations, and lay us helplef*
" at their feet ! But is it not too much to call
f for unanimity in the further prosecution of
e this war ? They whose incapacity has been
proved by a series of the moll unvaried di
" fafters call for unanimity! can their lata ads,
'Â» their prosecutions, their violences in Eng
" land and Scotland, and (till more so in Ire
n land, delude the people of France into an
8 idea that they have the hearts of the coun
c try with them ! Take the convetfe of the
e proposition. Would not the miniflers of
the crown deride a declaration from the Di
redtory, in which, if a La Vendee was (till
e raging in France or Ireland now, they still
1 talked of possessing the unanimous sentiments
l " of the people. The treatment of Ireland
e was such as to harrow up the foulâit was
;s (hocking to the heart, to think that a nati
on of brothers was thus to be trampled on
l " like the most remote colony of conquered
" e strangers ; and it was monllrous to hear the
minister talk of wielding Ireland as a wea-
E Â» pon of force, Ireland which h: was now
himfelf holding under amilitary hand ! The

Ie- They firft held out to us the tempting oc-
cafiOn of attacking France, united with all
,ur Europe. Year after year their objedt chan

m . of bankruptcyâruined financesâdillradted
ian countryâreign of terror infupportableâ
ons reign of terror at an end, and consequently
lex the vigour it createdâall in their turn were
ng the baits they held out, and all as they fail
we ed made way for new delulions. Every
jht thing was to be effedtcd by our allies j and
!" accordingly four millions one year, two mil
ufe lions for another, and two millions sent by
the Health in the third, were declared to be the
the cheapest way of carrying on the warânow
be we are cut off from this cheap mode of de
:art fence. I was alarmed for the confrqucnce ;
since being cutoff from this cheapest mode'
I feared we must be forced to take more ex-
tfa*agaÂ»t means ; but here I was happHy
i/ifappointed ; for this relief from the empe
ror has been accompanied by lowering ojr
army and na\y at home. Where he h*Â»
failed, therefore, he has gained. Again,
he said that there was no way of supporting
the bank but by fending money to the Em
peror :he did fend it and the bank
ftopt ! He is now prevented from fending
any more money to the emperor ; and I un
derstand that the paper of the Bank is in
better credit than it was ! In the fame man
ner every declaration that he has ever made
has f tiled him ; but norte so lamentably as
in his finance. He has uniformly in each
December stated the ex pence of the year
millions under what it has turned oirt to be ;
and yet he calls for unanimity ! He can
expeft no unanimity ; and in truth there is
no remedy for our evi's but peace !
And this is not all: we must have peace
and repose, not merely by the change of
ministers and their condign punishment, but
by a thorough change and reform in the sys
tem which has brought us to this ruin, by
a returu to the principles of liberty, not of
power. Without this there could be no
preservation of this country.âl feel it as my
most solemn duty t& speak out. Urdefs
Ireland isinftantly conciliated, and brought
back to the enjoyment of its genuine rights
and communion in the Constitution j unless
Scotland is also reconciled; unless til the
three kingdoms are restored to the blelfingl
of that peace and perfeft freedom of which
they have been deprived, there can be no
chance for the country to rife out of her
present misfortunes; nor until,yeu acconj

cause until you obtain this, you cannot
speak to France with the power of union;
nor can you delude the Dire&ory with the
boast of ilrength while they fee you aliena
ting by profecutioii every part of the empire.
In the argument which I have taken the li
berty to trouble you,with, I have not wan
dered from the particular measure of the day
because it is inseparable from the causes that
have given rife to it. This is no common tax;
and it is our duty on a question of such
dreadful import, to follow the wife pra&ice
of our ancestorsâto consult our constituents.
. Do not let us delude ourselves by the idea
that there is no danger. It is imminent.
No human being can calculate the horrors
to which this measure may give rife. I de

of talking of the theoretical blessings of our

MR FENNO,
It is to be wished that the managers of
the City Dancing Assembly would inform
the public which of their number it was,
that furiit(hÂ«d Bache with a cbpy of the
President's note, for publication.
Jt is proper that the individual who was
guilty of so ungentliman like an afrion, of
jo unprecedented a breach of confidence
and decorum, (hould be separated from the
reft, left the whole number ftould remain
fnbjeft to the cetifure which such conduct i
deserves.
The author of this communication to
Bache, is requeued to state at what time it
has happened, that a gentleman, having
sent an invitation to another, and received
an answer, has sent that answer to the news
papers ? He is requested to declare, wheth
er the publication of private letters has not
always been obnfidered as one of the mod
difhonorafele breaches of private confidence ?
But if the note mull be published ; if
this breach of good manners and honor,
unheard of in the cafe of any private g"' -
tlemen, was necefTary to be praftifed to
wards the President of the United States ;
why feleft Bache for that purpose ? Was it
because there cxifted a wish to gratify his
peculiar rancour against the President ; or
that the other printers were considered as
incapable of lending their aid to so ungen
tleman like a proceeding ? Either motive is
difliooorable to the managers, and will dis
honor them, unless they free themselves
from the general stigma, by pointing out
the individual to whom it ought to be con
fined. This measure they owe not only to
themselves, but to the fubferibers who ap
pointed them, and to the city at large ; for
it would be far less degrading to the one and
the other, that one person capable of such
conduct (hould have crept into the lift of
managers, than that the whole (hould be
considered, throughout the United States
as composed of such unworthy materials.
This mistake cannot be committed here,
where they are all known ; but elfewbere it
may and will be committed, unless preven
ted by themselves.
j MR. FENNO,
If I rightly understand the opinion given
by the Chief Justice of this state, to certain
judges of the late ele&ion (asftjted in Mr.
Bache'*papcr of the 22d inft.) it contains
v in substance the fallowing principle, viz.
That a* our revolutionary conted with the
British Government, was a civil war, all the
fubjeds of Great-Britain, who espoused the
American cause, and were fettled in this
country at any time before the definitive
treaty of peace, became entitled .to the
rights of citizeofhip within the United
States.
I :m sensible tint gifat deference is due
to thtliigh authority from whence this opi
nion is derived ; hut as in matters of gov
ernment, no principle (however fan&ioned)
ought to be adopted, but on the matureft
investigation, and fulled convidion, I (hall
presume to offer to the public, the following
queries on this fubjedl.
Was it not eftablifhcd in the late constitu
tion of this state, as a fundamental and in
violable maxim, that the people have an un
alienable and indefeajible right to alter, reform
or abolish their government, as they (hall
think proper ; and is not the fame maxim,
recognized with equal folcmuity, in omr pre
sent conftitutiou i
Does it not follow, that when this prero
gative is duly exereifed, by the people of a
ny country, such an adl is of right com
plete in itfelf and not merely inchoate f
Did not the people of the United States
a&ually exercise this right, when by their
representatives in Congress, they declared
these dates to be free and independent, and
that all politicaletnntflion between them and
the state of Great Eriuin was and ought to
be totally dijpilved ?
If these principles be recognized, is it
net evident, that this country from the time
of the foregoing declaration, was of right
completely independent ; that the peop'e there- j
of from that moment, formed a diftin&com
munity ; that of consequence the inhabit
ants of all other countries without diltinfti
on, were to be confidtred relatively to them
as foreigners ; and thar fron tlunce forward
no citizen or ftibje'ft of any othsr state
could obtrude hitnfelf as a citizen of the
United States, without the express fanfti
on of the conftjtutioiis or laws eftab'iifhed
therein ?
Does it not appear manifeft, that these
principles were admitted throughout the U
nited States, from their aflumption of all
the rights of sovereignty ; frbru their con
fifcation of the property of those inhabitants
of this country, who adhered to the King
of Great Britain; and from their refufal to
treat with the British government for peace
on any other footing than that of an indepen
dent power ?
Is it not evident, that France regarded
the United States as a nation of right com
pletely independent, from the treaty con
cluded by that nation with this country
during our revolutionary contest, as well as
from the declaration made at that time by
their government to Great Britain, that
they considered us as having the full pofTef
fion of the powers of independence : and is
it not equally evident that Great Britain con
sidered us in the fame point of view, when
(be treated with us as an independent peo
ple >
Do not these circumstances prove, that
our war with Great Britain, ought from the
time of our declaration of independence, to
be considered as a war between two separate
dates, and not a civil war, which (as the
term civil implies) is a contest between citi
zens of the fame state?
Would not any other conftruftion, impair
the validity of our sovereignty, from the pe
riod when the declaration of independence
took place, until the time of the definitive
treaty of peace; and thereby render dispu
table many of the confifcations and other
publie aÂ£fs, which a a sovereign people we
undertook to perform; and would it not
place our existence as a nation, on the de
grading b3fis of a concession from Great
Britain ?
If then it appears, from evidence equally
founded on righ', on faft, and on experi
ence, that this Commonwealth from the time
of thÂ« declaration of Independence, was,
and ought to be considered as a state com
pletely sovereign, and independent, is it not
manifeft, that the fubjefts of Great Britain,
could from that time become citizens of this
Commonwealth only in the manner prescribed by
our con/litutions to other Foreigners ?
CIVIS.
For the Gazette'of the United States.
MR FENNO,
The rditor rf the Aurora has with his vfual
impartiality,given his readers a partial compari
son of the two la A e!c<st'ons, from which he
draws a drop of consolation to his drooping
friends, by afltiring them that the republican
spirit of the city is rifing âI (hould with him
to extend his calculations into Southwark, but
perhaps it would hurt his feelings tu go there ;
the discipline administered to his party would
prove that a true republican spirit is there rap
idly risingâupon his own principles (such as
they are) th s companfcin will prove lhat his
party i 9 faft declining. October eleflion, Mor
gan had 7(, at the fpeoial one jâAt the for
mer Israel had 984, at the latter he had 746âbe
fide,the eleflion was declared illegal on the
ground that a number of bad votes were given
in this very diftrifl. It is rather degrading to
attempt to prove that the deeilion o 1 the enm
mittee ol the fentate wÂ»s justly founded, but as
they have been wickedly traduced in fureral
anonymous publications, a ftnall sample of one
of them will fufliceâwhere he fays, thatjuflice
is projlreted, and their conferences put to steep by
the anodyne of faSion. It will therefore not be,
amift to look at the gross number of votes of the
two ele&ions. Oclohrr eleAion there were 10'9,
at the special one 106Sâthus we fee that in the
late flruggle, when the forces of both parties
were muttered, there weie only nine more votes
given than in o<slober, when the sickness too
was fafore that they could not hold the eJeftian
in their usual place on that account. I think
this an inctntef/able proof that the ele&ion was
illegal and justly frt aside. This lie alone (of
Israel being a pcrfecutcd, injured man, by being
wrongfully turned out) certainly obtained him
tooo votes at lead. It was in almost every Is
raelite's mouth, he was turned out, and we will
vote for himâwhether he is suitable or not is
no qurflionâhe iÂ» injured and we will redress
his wrongs. P. I
CHINESE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.
[Ext rails from Sir. G. Staunton's " Authen
tic account ef an Embafjy to China,"
The Chinese arc, perhaps, upon an aver
age better able to support moderate labour J
with little intcrmifflon than nsany of the
lower clafles in Europe. They are bred in
better and founder habits, and continue lon
ger under the dire&ien of their parents.
They are for the mnft part sober ; they
marry early ; they are lefÂ« cxpofed to the
I temptations r.-f debauchery ; are left liable
to contrail diseases which currupt the fp itij
of life ; their lives are more regular and
uniform. It has been calculated, upon the
authority of fafts and ohfervations, that not
withstanding the baneful luxuries in which
the European rich indulge, the difordera
of repletion, inactivity and vice, to which
they arc fubjeEls, the mean duration of therr
I ves exceeds about ten years that of their
inferiors, whom excessive fatigue had con
tributed to wear out before their time J
whom poverty had deprived of the means of
proportional comfort and fubfifteÂ»ce ; who
are more exposed to the inclrmencies of the
weather, and accidents of life ; and less
guarded against their e(Te6ts. as well as more
liable to disease, with less leisure or means
for cure.
The Chinese have no Sunday, nor even
such a division as a week. The templeÂ»
are, however, open every day for the visits '
of devotees. Persons Â»f that description !
have,from timetotim*,madegrants, though
to no great amount, for the maintenance of
tbeir Clergy, but no lands are fubjeft to I
ecclefiartical tithes. A land-tax to govern
ment has been substituted in the lad reign,
to a poll-tax, as better proportioned to the
faculties of individuals. Molt imports, and
all luxuries, are likewise taxed) but the du
ty being added to the original price of the
articles, is feldonr distinguished from it by I
the consumer. A transit duty is* laid like
wise on goods passing from one province to
another. Each province in China, which may !
be compared to an European kingdom, is j
noted chiefly for the produftron of fomt par
tiiblar article, the conveyance of which
to supply the demand for in the other, rai
ses this dutyto aconfiderable sum, and forms '
the great internal commerce of the empire.
Presents from the tributaries and fubjefts
of the Emperor and the cotififcations of
opulent criminals, are not overlooked is
enumerating the refofcrces of the public
treasury. Taxes, fiich as upon rice, are
received in kind. The several species of
grain, on which many of the poorer clafles
of the people principally subsist, are exem
pted from taxation ; so it wheat, to which
rice is alwaysprÂ«;ferred.
The population of China, as estimated
by Sir George Staunton at 333 raillons, is
considerably more than twice that of the
whole of Europe, andmore than three-eighths
of that of the whole earth, according to the
following statement, which has been deemed
tolerably correft .
Asia, 450,*00,000
Africa, -150,000,000
America, 160,000,000
Europe, 114,600,000
Total, 884,600,000
The Chinese wall,-which is nearly 1500
miles long, (1200 of which arc finifhed
(pastes over a ridge of mountains which in
one place wants but 75 feet of being a mile
high. Both fides of which being now tri
butary, to the Emperor, no longer excites
any wonder in tke country.

AT a juncture when the quefiion of
a Commercial Treaty "with France may soon
become an ohjeit of difculTion, a work of this kind
becomes extremely ufefui to those eitizens of the
United States, who may be defirons to enable them
selves to view this fubje&, under its various af
peds ; and they will have the fatisfadion to be
furniihed with the necessary data, to judge of the

'X his work is principally djftinguifhed by the
richness of the obfervauons, the pcrfpieuity of the
i4cas, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. A t Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work *as liktt a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeiul produce. It is addref â¢
fed to the unfortunate La Favette, in letters,
which fug tive form, the author who could only
devote a lew weeks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although circumflancÂ«B are in many
refpe&s different at the present day, from what
ihuy were in the year 179?, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny absolute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
fulc of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince h*m that io all tranfa&ions, between free
nations, every thing may be expc&ed from the ef
forts of truth and julUce.

LETTER 111.
Effayin tbÂ« form cf a table&u t to appraise the im-
into the United States/row France and Eng
land un'tcd. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furciftied from France or
England âlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would have allnniihed a meie theorist) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kin i of tableaux, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be defiled, aie the only sure guides
the statesman can take for the policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cannot too much admire the apparent cx
adnefs of colonel Swan's calculations ; and although
the propbtfie* of Lord Sheffield have already been
eontrad:6ied by experience, and by Ceverai able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of the prelent work,
dispute with him the only grout don which N he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the requiied condition, will be better able
than Gieat Britain to iupply us with several articles,
which the authoi al ots exchifively and forev
er to the latter; the author's partiality ajtEl on (if he
has any) dors nut appear to have at any time created
a paitiiuity ojjudgment, i he result of this calculation
is that in <789, that is to fay, at a period when arts
aÂ».d manufa&ures did sot 'prcfent in France the vast
means and probabiU y of extension which they now
pofTcf*. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half of any given Quantity of the produdions of France
gnd I ngland united, but also to enter into competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of her government, and Â»he industry
of her inhabitants.
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the exportations of the United States,
and particular examination of their suitableness to
France} this is one reason why, notwithstanding the
excellent work of Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta~
Heau is by bo means fupeÂ»fluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France from the
importation' f provisions and raw materials, is every
where applied i and it is upon this argument, that
the author eftablilhes his demands to the French go
vernment, for the limited admiriion of the produc
v tionsot his country into France.

to tha rifq*e. But it is Hot easy to arrange these
ander particular heads or clalfes, so as to describe
each with the neceflary accuracy. Each cafe must
therefore be decided upon according to the circum
ilanccs a tending it ; and these circumflances wili,
in general,, appear from the description accompa
ny. ug the application.
Buildings partly conflfu&ed of brick or stone,
arc preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the {tile of building, how thÂ»r are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are eonfiderations tÂ«
be taken into view. And with refpeit to goods,
their tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, either
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in such ilate to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden andhaily removal, or to be do
le!) in time of confifion and hurry, are all cir
cumflances of weight; and the premiums must be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following conditiont are to be under
load by the parties . â¢
ifh The Insurance is not binding till the ftipu
latcd premium be paid ; but it fliall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
signed or not.
td. Insurances may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
penses than the payment of the premium of the re
newed fcrm, the circumstances continuing the fame
as they were underflood by the Infur< rs at the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is effcntial to such renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he.
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed on the former policy but by computing the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjeifl of insur
ance may nevcrthelefs be open to treaty"for a new
insurance.
3d. If ary other insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mull be made known at the time of
application, otherwise the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trust, or on consignment,
may be insured as such in a separate policy ; but
they are not to be confidercd as infnied otherwise.
sth. This company will not be liable or accoun
table for any loss or damage occafionrd by any for
eign invasion, or by any military or usurped force,
or by peafon of any civil commotion j or occasion
ed by gunpowdi r, aquafortis or other thing of the
ltke kind kept in the building, or amongst the pro
perty iafured.
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds aad other Secu
rities, Title Deeds, Money, Bank and other pro
miflary Notes, are not included in any insurance ;
nor are paiHtings, medal-, jewels, gems, antique
curiofitien, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty five dollars eaeh, to be oonfidered as insured un
defs particularly mentioned and by special agree
ment.
I 7th. No insurance will be made for a fiiorter
term than one year, nor .'or a longer term than fe
vca years. Persons choofirg to insure for seven
years shall be allowed one year's premium by way
of difeount: One third ol a years premium shall
be abated in like manner on an insurance for
three years.
Bth. Loflss sustained by fire *n property infurid,
(ball be paid in thirty days after due prouf and li
quidation thereof, without deduction.
A defciiption of the property to be insured will
be expected with each application, to be made by
' a matter carpenter and signed by him, as well as
by the owner of the building 01 applicant for in
furauce, and attefled before a Notary or principal
Magistrate, who will certify his knowlejgc of the
parties and their credibility.

fion\hat a publication for general benefit, apd Â«-â¢

from the liberal minds of the merchants and others
of this city, as places of less opulence in the Uni

(hould result to the citizens tram such a publica-*
tion, yet it might prevent an idea abroad which,

of this extenfivj city was on the decline, and con
traded into so narrow a sphere that it would Hot
fjpport a Price Cnrrent.
The general anxiety that prevails in the com

âNor can the utility be doubted, when it is con
