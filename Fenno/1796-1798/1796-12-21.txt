capacity; to which, by the laws of the.land, all the
joint as well as separate property of the said Gen'le-'
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it is clearly and fatisfa&orily ascertained, that mr.
Blair M'denachan, of the said firm, has conveyed

This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whomso

Continuation of the delate on the ad'dreft in anftacr
to the President's fpceeh.
Thursday, December ly
Mr. Amrt said if any man were to call himfelf
more free and enlightened than bit fellows, it would
be considered at arrogant felf-praife. His very de
claration would prove that he wasted sense as well
as modesty, but a nation might be called so, by a
citizen of that nation, without impropriety; be
cause, in doing so, he betiows no pvaife of superi
ority on himfelf, he may be in fail and may be sen
sible that he is less enlightened than the wife of o
ther nations. This fort of national eulogium may,
no dotibf, be foftered by vanity and grounded in
mistake, it is sometimes jyft, it is ccrtainly com
mon and not always either ridiculous or offenfive.
It did not fay that France or England had not
been remarkable for enlightened men ; their literati
are more numerous and diftingu'ifhed than our own.
The chara&er with refpeft to this country, he said
was ftri&ly true. Our counttymen, almost uni
versally, possess some property and some portion of
learning, two diftin&ions so remarkably in their
favor as to vindicate the expreflion objeÂ£led to.
But go through France, Germany, and most coun
tries ef Euiope, and it wiiuld befpundthat out of
50 millions of people not more then two or three
had any pretentions to knowledge, the reft being
comparatively with Americans ignorant. In France,
which contain# 25 milliors of people, only one was
calculated to be in any refpeft enlightened, and
perhaps under tne old system, there was not a great
er proportion possessed of property; whilst in A
merica, out of four millions of people, scarce any
part of them could be elaffed upon the fame ground
with the rabble of Europe. That class called vul
gar, canaille, rabble so numerous there does not exist
here as a clafi though our towns havu many indi
viduals of it. Look at the Lazaroni of Naples
there are 20,000 or more houseless people, wretch
ed and in want ! He # asked whether, where men
wanted every thing, and were rn the proportion of
29 to J, it was possible rhat they could trusted
with power. Wanting wisdom and morals how
would they use it ; it was therefore that the iron
hand of defpntifm was called in by the few who
had any thing, to preserve any kind of controul
1 oÂ»er the many. This evil, as it truly was, and
which he did not propose to commend, rendered
true liberty hopeless. . In America out ot four
millions of people the proportion which cannot
read and write and who, having nothing, are inte
rested in plur.dtr and cortfufion and disposed for
both, is small. in the fouthcrn states he knew there
were people well informed, he disclaimed all design
of invidious comparison ; the members from the
fou:h would be more capable of doing justice to
their constituents; but, in the cartei n dates, he
was more particularly convetfant, and the
people in them could generally read and write, and
were well informed as to public affairs. In" such a
country liberty is like to be permanent. It is pof
fible to plant it in such a foil and reasonable to hope
that it will take root and flourifh long as we fee it.
But can liberty, fueh as we understand and enjoy,
exist in societies where ike few only have property
and the many are both igaorant and licentious.
Wat there any impropriety, then, io faying what
was a fadt I At it rcfpe&s government, the decla
ration is ufeful. It is refpe&fu! to the people to
speak of them with the justice due to them, as e
minently formed for liberty, and worthy of it.
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) on a
former occasion had said he adored the people ; but
now when there was a wish to pionounce thf;.attri
butes of his divinity, he was not found snore fer.
vent in his adoration than many who had made no
such profeflioD. If they are free and enlightened,
let us fay soâis they are not, he should no longer
adore them ; they would not certainly be worthy
of honors quite divine. Mr. Ames said they ought
not only to fa} this because it was true, but because
their faying so would have the effect to produce
that felf-refpeft which was the bed guard of liber
ty, and most conducive to the happinefsftf society.
It was ufeful to /hew where our hopes and the trne
fafety of our freedom arerepofed. It cheriftied in
return from the citizens a just confidence, a spirit
of patiiotifra unmixed with foreign alloy, and the
courage to defend aconftitution that a people real
ly enlightened knows to be worthy of its effortt.
If the words were e'bjeftionable, it would be ea
sy to alter them to avoid the objection without im
pairing eflcntially their force. A gentleman nfar
him,had funnelled the propriety of faying we were
" among the freed and most enlightened." He
had no objedtion to the alteration, though he saw
no reason fer altering the phraseology. The citi
zens of a free government ought, he said; to be
lieve they were the most free and enlightened, be
cause, having the power of making' the govern
ment what tln-y plc-afe, if it were not the belt, ft
would be their own fault fer not making it so.
He believed the house would not be surprised, if
he took notice of what had been said in illulion to
him in the course of the debateâallusions with
which he could not be offended, bccanfc they were
urged with so many expreflions of the most flatter
ing civility. But every gentleman would believe
those things were not applicable to him, as their
recolle&ions would not fail to prove. What had
been his language with refpeft to Great-Britain ?
Did he fay we were to submit ? Did he fay we
were not 10 defend onr country ? .Was he then a
fraid as they were now, that foft words would not
be foft enough ? No ; such language came not
from him. Do nothing to irritate ; wage no war ;
no hostility. Such he called sequestration and o
thei a&s of that nature. We were, hÂ« faid,about
to make war on British property, and that such a
war would have been considered as an open war.
He therefore wished to shut ourselves up in our (hell
like a tortoise. But, at the fame time, he recom
mended troops to be raised, ships to be built, taxes
to be laid, sad a spirited claim Â«f justice to be
urged. The Â£cntletr?n who wiflieJ at ihat timS
particularly to preserve peace, did not wilh to hÂ»ld
eut the olive branch alone, by leaving the country
defencel'efj. This many their oppoferf abfo
iutely did. These, he said, were their reasons, and
they had been effectual. He wauld net go into an
examination of the fubjeÂ£t now. It was their wilh
to urge every exertion of the country, to have cal
led forth the last dollar and the lad man in defence
of the country in cafe of necessity. Did this look
as if they-wifhed to truckle te Great-Britain ? Ma
ny of their *>ppofers, so Kealous then for retalia
tion and reprisal, were not for any thing elseâ
neither troops, (hips, taxes nor treaty. This the
yeas and nays op the journal will eftab'lifh. Will
the oppofer3 (hew half the spirit now that we felt
and expressed at that day ?
How happened it t he asked, .that gentlemen
were so angry beea'ife they had then heard the lan
guage of pence, and tow because the fame lan
gtwge was held ? Not one of us desire hostility.
Was it becaufc Great-Britain was then the ebjedt
and France now. Wrongs from the former cannot
berefented enough, and wrongs and insult too from
the latter require words of more ardor than a lo
ver's. No man Jclt more for the wrongs of Ame
rica than he did. But, was it not the part of dig
nity and prudence to endeavour to obtain restituti
on for those wrongs rather than take up arms. But
was it suited to national dignity to make use of the
language that had been uled on that occafmn by
many of his oppofets, he thought both national
and p'erfonal dignity forbade it, he had thought it
equally intemperate and unbecoming.
Did not gentlemen seem to feel more for one in
dividual than foran insult on the nation and
its government. The administration might fuffer
contumely and abuse, and the country too with
out producing any emotions in the breads of gen
tlemen ; their feelings Teemed to take quite ano
ther dire&ion ; if# British miniÃer should outrage
our government as the minifterof France had done,
every one would be for avenging the wrong. Ai d
ha thought it right that they Ihould now declare
their determination Â«f supporting the executive in
the fuppott of our national honour and dignity, or
let him fee in season that he was to be abandoned.
The gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr. Harper)
had jnftly said, that though we had no navy to flip
port our pretentions, we had yet come off better
lhag Sweden or Denmarkâcountries which had
beeft produced as patterns of wisdom. Though he
did not suppose the British treaty would be carried
into effedt, so as to fatisfy every person who had
fuffered in his property by the British, yet hetruQ.
ted, tiie event would prove in a degree
fatisfaftory. He wished all other depredation on
our commerce might be in the end as nearly com
pensated.
At the time when government was pursuing her
negociation, we were cmbarraffed with Spain, with
the Indians and with the Western people. On the
fÂ»a our citiiens were fuffering in their property.
The British treaty was therefore made under disad
vantageous circumstances. It was not a little ho
noiabltf to the government, and truth would in time
procure the universal assent to it, that we have saved
our peace, recovered our territory, and made pro
vision for the reparation of the spoliations.
It fcemed as if gentlemen could never fay enough
on the fubjeS of the British treaty aod of Great-
Britain. The bank, treasury, and other topics ef
declamation, which were formerly always tn order,
seem to be almost forgotten. Was this the way,
he aflced, in which they meant to recommend to
the citizens the due refpedl for the adts of a majo
rity of that house and of congress. If they think
this the belt way of answering the endt of govern
ment and of producing confidence and harmony
amongst tho people, they did vtell. The means ap.
pearcd difprogortiened or rather ftfangely oppofiie
to that end. He was of a different opinion. He
thought, and it was with due seriousness of delibe
ration he declared the people were called upon to
chufe between them ; between those who wished to
fuppor; government, and those wlie avowed so tin
feafonffile and so excessive a sensibility to a foreign
intcrert and foreign nation ; between those who con
demned the infuiu offered to the government and
those who seemed to approve them ; those who
thought the experiment of oar government had
succeeded aad thole who were bound in consisten
cy with their own assertions to fay it was to be n
bandoned with difgult and in despair. He was of
opinion they could not go on as tbey were ; and
the people could remove the evil by chufing ;hofc
who would he better agreedâthe people free
and enlightened, would have no difficulty in chu
fing between them. Both fottsof men ought not
to be there; rither those who like the government
are in the right or those who .lifpute, revile and des
pise it. The people would he joubted not, judge
tight. He wished the appeal to be raada without
delay, and so solemnly at to make it effedhisil.
Mr. Christie said he was not afraid of offending
any nation ; but he did not think we were the molt
enlightened, and theiefore he was unwilling to fay
so. If -the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Parker)
would permit him to amend his motion, he would
move to have inserted after the word " freed'' and
" among the most enlightened.'' \
Mr. Parker cojifented.
Mr. Swanwitk thought- the amendment had
great advantages ; but he thought the word
" among" should come before, instead of after
" freed" because, notwithstanding all that had pas-
I kd, rxtthing would tend more to preserve the peace
of the country, than the treating of others with
refpeft.
Mr. Christie objefled to Mr. Swanwick's prepo
fitioH, because he believed we were the freed, but
not the most enlightened nation.
Mr. Coit thought the present was an idle difputc
about words ; and that instead -of a feflion of thiee
months, they should require sne of twelve to do
the necefTary business, if they proceeded in this
manner. He wiihed the proposed alteration might
take place, amongst the freeft, &c.
Mr. Oilet could not help observing that the gentle
man from,s. Carolina ( Mr. Smith)* had brought for
ward an example from the pradice of the French,
which he seemed to expedl to have great force, as if a
precedent from that country was t6 have influence
here> If the gentleman thought it was to have any
tffv 1 * K'f ipin'oti', fie tell Jiim ni wrÂ»
ttaftifcen. He ihould think for himi 't, and neither
be guided by the French government, or any man in
France. Indead the vaunting itileof the French wis
one of thole things which he liketi the least iu that
country. The gentleman from Maflachnfetts ( Mr.
Ames) had insinuated that he ( Mjr.Ciles) no lander
adored the peeple, because lie declined to call them
the freeft and most enlightened. He would tell that
gentleman that he thought as highly ot tne people as
he ever did ; and that he waspleafed with the pictur;
which Mr. Ames had drawn between the lower elide*
of Europe and those of this country ; but tho' he tho't
highly of their enlightened state he did not think it
necessary to tell the world we were the freeft and meÂ£
enlightened. Mr. Giles did not think the diftin&iou
which Mr. Ames had drawn between a nation calling:
itlelf the most free and enlighened, and an individual
calling hmfelf so, was well supported. However if
the house were determined to use.the exprefiÃbn, he
should fay no more on the fubjedl.
The gentleman from Maflachufetts ( Mr. Ames)
had spoken of individuals being opposed to govern
ment. He wifiied to have this matter rightly under
stood. If Ae gentleman meant by government all the
branches as organized by the conftituion he would
fare him he wasafirm friend to it; but if he callt<i
the Executive alone, the government, in diftiniftian
from the other branches, he might think it neceiTiry
to be some times oppefed to that ; for though he be
lieved this to be a part of the government, he could
never consent to have it called the government.
Mr. Giles diftiked extremely, any intimate connec
tion betwixt this country and Great Britiin, notwith
standing pecuniary advantages might arise from futh
a connexion ; for there was something in the connee
tion it felt, tint would outweigh all -partial advantage#
which could be derived from it. What, said Mr.
Giles, is our prcfent fitnation ? The President's com
munication was far from agreeable, and some mtm
bers of that house had received information from Pal
is which was still more alarming. France he said, wsÂ»
the most powerful enemy we could "ontend with, at the
only one that could affect* otir territory. She had it
also in her power effeflually to deftroy,our commerce.
Ought we, then, he asked, to felicitate' aurl'elres upon
this situation of things ? The gentleman ( Mr. Ames)
had yesterday said, we were 011 the eve of a war, and
called upon them to cotne forward, and to fay what
they would do. If these were the eff.-ils of a wife and
firm negociation with Great Britain, he lamented
them, at most calamitous.
Mr. Giles concluded with obftrvii.; that hefelt the
fame adoration for the voice of the people that he had
always done; and he trufled no raan could chi.-gr
him with having acted contrary to that sentiment, or
with even making a declaration which did not arise
from feeling or conviction. He should r.at cuke tnj
farther attempt to Â«lt;r the address. When it came
into the house, he doubted not gentlemen would have
an opportunity of (hewing their difapprobatioti by vot
ing against different parts, or against the addret* is
toto. He (hould vote against the thin altogether.''
Mr. Dayton ( the Speaker) said that some 'of the
observations which lud been brought into the prefVnt
debate were of too delicate a nature to be commtrmi
upon or even repeated, h: should not therefore folldw
who spoke last in his enquiry how far
this country wasexpe<9ed to be annoyed by France in
the poflfible, though happily not probable, event of a
rupture with that country.
As to the word* "freed and most enlightened"
which were more immediately the fubjed* of difcut
(ion, he did nut object againijl them od the groin,J
of fact, but he eonfidered the exprcflton as revolving
itfelf into a question of decorum and deliescy, the
rules ms which appeared to him to be violated, in
their ascribing to themselves such n superlative pre
ference (however true) in a companion with every
other people. The amendment of the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. Christie) very much foftened
the termi and rendered them mÂ»re palatable.
Some remark* had fallen trim the gentleman
from Maflachufetts (Mr. Ames) which were irre
lative to the fubjedt, And Mr. Dayton could have
wished had been therefete omitted. Had he con.
tented himfelf with challenging any member to point
out a single mllaiice ofinconfiftency in him and pur
sued the fuhjeft no farther Mr. D. said that hi*
r?fpeÂ£*and friend/hip for the gentleman from Maf
fachnfetts would nave indueed hjm to be silent, but
when that gentleman had wantonly gone out of hiÂ»
way to bring into view and arraign the policy of
tertain energetic measures which were at a former
session contemplated to coonterjftthcencroachmentÂ»
of Great-Britain, he felt himfelf called upon to take
some no.tice of them. Those measures, and seques
tration in particular had" been on a former occasi
on aficrted, and now again unneceflarily repeated,
to have been intended as acts of hostility. Is it
then (enquired Mr. D.) an aft of hostility Amply
to lequefter, or in wotda to attach and to
arrell and detain in thie country the property of
the Brjjilh nation as a pledge orfeeurity for the in
demnification ps the citizens of the United State*
against the depredations of that nation, and is it no
adt of hostility against this couptry to have their
property not merely frqueftered, but condemned,
conMfqated and wafted by the cruizers, fubjedts, go
, vernment and courts of that nation. ..Such, he wa*
lorry to fay, had formerly been the reasoning and as->
fertion of the gentleman from Maflachufetts. The
United States must not sequester, for it was wa. t
but the plunder and confifcation of the property of
our citizen, was not to be termed hostility, but Â«ai
only ground for negociation. If , t \we ppflible
for tint gentleman to reconcile that ftWking iÂ»eon
nlrcncy, he mtght then free himfelf from the impu
tatiou. x hat he himfelf had advocated all the en
ergetic measures which were proposed on a former
Critical occasion in that house, was, Mr. Dayton
said h,, r e and his boa ft. He then thought,
and he (hU thought, that if they had been carried
into effed., the lituatiou of this country both as it
re, P cfted the indemnification of our fellow.citizena
who had been plun&red, ,nd our commercial and
political connedhon with Great-Bntain would be
tar more favorable than it could be said to be at that
moment.
Â£ Debate to be continued. J
Tuesday, December 20.
A letter was received'from the secretary of state.
ineiofing the annual report of the director of the
m,:it. flu, report was very long, and propefed
means of tendering the eftablifWnt lefg expei,five
and more produdtive, one of the principal of which
was that the depofitore of bullion (hould not have

ounces were alloy, the coining of the whole cost
government jool. and yet the depositor receiv
ed the difference in coin withoot charge !
This report was referred to a fel â ft committee of
ihree members and ordered to be printed.
Mr. D. Foster, by direction of the committee
of claims moved to have that committee discharg
ed from the further eonfideration of the petition of
William Howe, a Nova-Scotia refugee, and to
have a committee appointed on thai fubjeft.âA
greed.
Mr. Andrew Jackson presented t!y petition of
James Orr of the (late of Teaeffee, praying for
restitution for the loss of five horses which the Che
rokee Indians had taken from him. Referred to
the committee of claims.
Mr. S. Lyman prefemed the petition of Gilbert'
Deneb, praying for relief on account of service
performed during the war. Referred to the com
mittee of claims.
Mr. Dearborn said he thought there were a num
ber of claims called liquidated claims which ought
not to be affected by the aft of limitation. He
begged leave therefore to propose a resolution tot
the house on that fubjeft. It was to the following
effect :
" ltefolved that 0 ttmmittei be appointed to en
quire into and report on the expediency or inexpe
diency of designating certain claims against the li
nked States to be excepted from the power of the
Â»ft of limitation."
Mr. W. Smith thought as business refpefting
claims was always referred to the committee of
claims this enquiry alio might beentrufted to them.
He ihould move, therefore, to amend the refoluti.
on by striking out the words, Â« a nomnittee to be
appointed," and add in their place " the commit
tee of claims be inftrufted."
Mr. Dearborn said he had no objection to the
enquiry being submitted to the committee of claims.
His aim would be anfweredif the enquiry was only
made. Agreed.
The order of the day was called for on the mili
tia bill, when
Mr. Williams rose and spoke at considerable
length against the present fyttem and t also against
the bill before them, and waa decidedly in favour of
striking out the firft feflion. His observations, in
which he recommends a new military fyftcm, will
be given to-morrow.
The queflion was put for striking out the firft
clause, and carried, there being 49 votes in favour
of it.
Mr. W. Smith moved that the committee rife,
report progress, and alk leave to fit again ; which
lie hoped would be denied ihem, in order that the
bill might be re committed to a felefil committee.
Mr. W. Lyman wished before the committee
rose, that what related to exemptions might be de-_
tided upon.
Mr. Hartley was in favour of the committee's
rising, that the bill might be re committed before
it was farther discussed. The plan which had been
proposed by the gentleman from New-York had
some weight with him, and he had no doubt it
would be attended to in a feleft committee.
Mr. Dearborn said his colleague ( Mr. W. Ly
Â»Â«n) seemed to think it would be Iseft to deter
mine now on the fubjeft of exemptions. He be
lieved there Were few gentlemen who did not con
cur on that head. A great complaint against the
present system was, that the burden of military ser
vice fell only upon \few. He doubted not the bill
would be rectified in this refpeft in the feleft com
mittee ; but he was not tenacious of his opinion,
and had no particular objection to its being done
then. â
Mr. Kitahell wiihed the bill to be re-commit
ted before any further steps were taken.
The committee rose and reported, and on leave
being asked to fit again, leave was refufed.
Mr. W. Smith moved that the bill be recommit
ted to a feleft committee.
Sixteen, nine and five members were mentioned
for a committee. The sense of the house was firft
taken upon the gteateft number and loft by a ma
jority of one 5 it was then taken en niue aad. tarri-
Mr. Coit wiflied to call the the attention of tne
house to a fubieft which he thought of fom# im
portance ; it was the balances due from feversl
dates ot the union to the United States. Three
years, he said, had elapsed since a report was made
â¢n that fubjtft. He did not know what order
was proper to be taken with that business Some
thing however ought to he dona. He thought
the firft ftcp fnonld be to ask the debtor staPes for
payment. He wished therefote to submit to the
>house the following resolution, which he wilhed to
lie on the table till to morrow.
" Resolved that the' committee of ways and
means be directed to report whether any, and if
any what measures should be taken relative to the
balances which by report of the committee appoint,
ed to fettle the accounts, were found due from dif
ferent Hates in the union"
' Mr. Ln'iujrft o " fa'd two clauses had been omit
ted by some inadverier.cy in the bill for the relief
and protection of American feamtn. They were
the clauses refpefting certificates on which the two
houses had differed in opinion. At the clauses
werej essential, the Frefident had supplied them.
With a view of removing this difficulty, and with
'Â»view of bringing the fubjeft again before the
house, he moved a resolution to the following ef
feft. . 5
" Resolved that a committee be appointed to en
quire into the alterai ions of the aft for relief and
protection of Ameriean seamen, and to report
what amendments are necessary to be made there
to." .
A committee of three members was appointed.
Mr. Blount said that Congress passed a resolu
tion on the t6th September 1796, granting ceitain
bounties and grants of land to the reprefentativcs of
officers and soldiers who were (lain in battle, which
be thought equally applied to those who died in
service. He said both cases had foimerly been
onfidered as included, but latterly the secretary at
war hadmaiea diftinftion. He should propose a
resolution to the haufe, in order tÂ» have â¢ declara
tion of their sense upon It. The refutation was to
the following-affecj.
?' Itefolvcd that a qpmroittee be appointed to
eaquire into, andtcport their opinion, on the equi
ty and expediency of extending to the representa
tives of officers and soldiers who died in the service,

The American citizens have often been aftonilh'd
at the fÂ»rprizing Equeflrian abilities of the celebra
ted Rickstts. We think the following account
of his pedeftrial performance, equals, if not furpaf
ies any of his feats of Hoifemmfhip. Oil Saturday
lad he ran, on foot, from Princeton, to Shabakunk
bridge (two miles and a halt from this city) in 52
minutes, which is nine miles and a half, and at the
rate of a mile every five minutes and a half. Mr.
Ricketts, some months since, went asgreatadif
tance in near as fhortatime, which by some was
thought incredibleâto fatisfy and convince such,
'he undertook thetafk again on S>Â«urday, in com
pany with theNew-Yerk public llage, from New-
York to Philadelphiaâthe passengers in which tef
tify tu the truth of this performance.
COMMUNICATIONS.
Our American Frenchmen fiy, the victorious re
public of France is irrefiftablc ; America is at her feet,
and cannot defend herfelf. If this is (which God be
thanked it is not) the deplorable and terrible condi
tion that the vineries of the IVoiich have brought the
United States into, may one make bold to Â«ik the ci
tizen democrats where was the good ftnfe and patri
otism of that p.>rty in rejoicing at the fucetffes which
have brought this about! Are they such aliens, or
rather traitors, in their hearts, as to rejoice full when

GRATITUDE.
It is with this virtue as with raoft others, those
who have it molt in their months have it lead in their
hearts.
Gratitude 11 The French, and the presses devoted
to them, have mad* a constant din about this sacred
debt. When our peace, our government, and our
independence,' were nearly facrifked, these deceivers
demanded the facrifice as a token that the fin of in
gratitude (hould not lie at the door of our nation.
To whom is this obligation due? Not to Wlsl
ington, you tell us, bccauf: he did no more than his
duty, and it would be dangerous to be grateful ts
him.
Is it due to the King of France, the very man who
did the favorâthe man to whom we raised flatues and
sung anthems ? O no, wi owe nothing to a King 1
and if we did, the guillotine has paid off the score.
Shall we thank the late Queen I O no, 'tis just as
bad as to thank a King. It is true {be was the firft
mover in the whole affair * but no matter; {he is as
cold in her grave as the femimeut of gratitude in
Jacobin hearts. ( <
Shall we thank the La Fayettes, the Cuflinee, the
LaUzuns, and the troops of heroes who fought for us ?
No, ne, no: the firft is baniihed i moll of the others
have had their throats cut. â¢
Te whom then are we Â»o owe fealty and homage ?
To those who cuy heir throats ? Why ? Because they
helped our revolution? No, thtj did not help it.â
Because they are good and benevolent ts all men?
Read their history for the answer. IJecaufe they are
so very just, friendly and refpeftful, to the free go
vtrnment which is 'lie i-i|vc and rich fruit of our inde
pendence ? No such thing.
What then it the blS* of the Jjcobia claith of gra
titude > Precisely this: The French emiflaries will
help the Jacobins to pull down our government. They
i lute as we hate ; and this sympathy Â»f pafiions, and
I community of interests, renders it ufeful to dupe as
nuny as we can. The song of gratitude his been a
fyrea-fong which in 1793 almost lulled aileephtiic true
spirit of independence.
SENATE of PENNSYLVANIA,
December Â»i, 1796.
On motion of Mr. Barton, seconded by Mr D. Wh*-
len ; the fallowing Resolutions were adopted and fer.t
to the -Aflembly for concurrence :
Whereas the wife, firm and patriotic administration
of George Wafiington, PiefidÂ«nt of the United
states, has finally conduced to the prosperity and bap
pinefs which the people of America enjoy, and the best j
reward we can bestow on him, is the expression of
our gratitude and approbation. Therefore,
Rei'olved unanimonfly,
That a committee be appointed to prepare and re
port to this house, an adcirefs to the President of the
United States, e\pre/five of our fentimentj with regard
to his past conduit, and of the sensations of regret | I
with which we contemplate his intended retirement j I
from office. |
Whereas the late address of the President to tha peo- j
pie of the United States, is in the opiaien of this Le- (
giflatare, an meflimabk legacy, replete with featirnents 1
highly important to the tnterefls of our country, jnd
deserving the most' serious attention of freemenâl '
Therefore, I
Resolved, That the said address be printed and pub- I
lilhed with the laws us the present fefiion, I
Ycfterday a Committee of the Senate of this ]
commonwealth waited on the governor, with the <
following answer to his Address: 1
To Tiomat Mifflin, Governor of the Commonwealth
of Ptnnfylvania.
Sir,
The encteafing population of the
with the general prosperity aad happinefn of its ci
tizens, afford a p!eafiÂ»j( evidence of the wisdom of
oar political iifiituuons.
Imp cSVd with a firm convi&ion, that the law*
alone lhould govern, and that by them, the will of
the community (hosld be so prescribed as to
preclude the neceffiry of exercising individual
.'ifcrction, we cannot but be sensible of the propri
ety of an attentive review of our laws rcfpeAing
elections, and (hall be wanting in duty to our con
diments, if we do not use every endeavour to a
mend and render them more dear and explicit.
The eftabliftiment and regulation of a military
force compatible with the freedom, yet adequate to
theexigencts of society, without impefing unneces
sary burthens on its members,, is an ohjedl that
will be the fuh)Â»Â£l of our most serious deliberations.
Believing knowledge and virtue the best guar
dians of public and ptivate happiness, and sensible
of the importance of impreffiens received in early
life, we (hall not be deterred by the difficulties of
the undertaking, or by any past mifcarringes, from
attempting to fulfill a conflitutional duty, and
place the attainment of tifeful inlUuftion, within
the reach of our most indigent fellow citizens. <;
VVe finccrcly participate in your regret, th*t in
the public tranfa&ions of the ui.ion, we aie about
to be deprived of the virtues and talents of ou*
beloved Prclident, which have justly inspired ani
[ verfal confidence, am. fervently join in your wifties,
that his remaining days may be happy as his past
life has been glorious.
I n the course of our fefGon, the remaining ob
jects of you addrefiSvill,' neceflarily, eagage a dire
attention, and we (hall rely, with confidence, on
your co-operation in every measure adapted to
the welfare of the community.
By order of the Senate,
ROBERT HARE,
Speaker of the Senate.

NEW YORK, December 19.
We obfsrve the appointment of agents to protest
and procure the releafc of American seamen that
I have been impressed, is likely to produce good ef
! fe&s. One good effect which the declaimets against
our<govertraient did not intend nor expect, is, to
demonstrate by official dacuments, that the Briti(h
vessels imprefi very few American seamenâthat
they do not wish to imprcfa anyâand that as foen
as the men are proved to be Americana, they are
delivered up without difficulty.

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all pcrfons against purchasing from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal eftatesJic conreyed away to
his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upan thefubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was do more than an execu
tion of that trull confided in the fubferibtrs by ,
those creditors: a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have oraitter?.
The very fiatement of the fact therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindidive.'' It originated in a desire to feeurC
the property of the debtor as a ftind tor the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fanftioned by the
advice of council as a meafurc neeejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement has been
injuria** to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjnftifiable conduct, not to the fub
fciibers who have merely publifhsd the truth i*
terms as mild as the fad would admit, and who
mean to investigate in a high court of jufticc the
validity of those purchasers of whieb Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently fpeaki.
The subscribers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
camion againU purthafug of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of u to a
purchase from any other persons (if such there be}
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.

A LEASE for seven years, from the 2sth March next, in that
capital and beautiful F ARM s calltd
PRO SPECT-HILL,
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Brandy wine
Mills, and half a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
THE dwelling house is built of stone, two stories high,
gemeelv finifhed, and contains four handsome room? on
a floor, betides an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellari. It is generally thought to command (he mod a
greeablc profpe& of the Delaware, from the source of that
liver to the Capes. This profpe& ia greatly embcllifhed by
a full view of a vast body ot meadow, through which the
Chrittiana and Brandywine creeks are seen winding in beau
tiful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen-, a spacious
{tone flable and hay loft, a barn, a carriage House, mifc
houfe,&e. and a well of as pure water as any on the conti
nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a
boanding with truit, and particularly with peach trees, of
he very best kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, apple
Orchard begining to bear, and leveral old trees that produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm consists of near sixty acres of land,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes,
twenty of which are now in excellent clover and timothy,
and ten more will be ready for lowing next spring. A re
sidence of nearly 8 year! has convinced the fublcriber that
the situation is remarkably healthy. The great post road
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy
yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and conveni
ence of this situation cannot be enumerated in an advertife
mept, and when examined, will probably command the at
tention of any person who isdefirous of li"ing at one of the
mod elegant country feats on the continent. The pure, bafcr
may enter on the premil s next spring, or perhaps, this fall,
if application be immediately made to Dbttor NICHOL AS
WAY, in Philadelphia, to Do&or WHARTON, on the
premises, or, in his ablenee, to Mr. GEORGE TRUIIT, in

A quantity of excellent Hay, Grain in the ground, some
