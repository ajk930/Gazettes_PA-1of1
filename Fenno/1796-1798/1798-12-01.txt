ADDRESS.
/It a fall fr eting of the officers of the Guilford
regiment of militia, and a large and rtfp eft ti
tle number of the inhabitant of the county,
convened at the court house in Martin Vide,
on Saturday the l September 1798, the
following Address was unaaimoufly voted
to the President of the United States.
President of the United Statis,
AN address presented to you at this time
on the fubjeft of the relative situation of
America wi(h foreign nations, hut more
particularly with France, fk>\>ld at "leall
poflefs some novelty ot thought to procure
with you an apology, or some strong reason
urged, why it had been so long Jelayed to
merit your reply. We hope you will not
anticipate any thing new, for in fa<2, we
only mean to adopt and urge the manv and
the excellent sentiments which have been
already addrefTed to ycu by our fellow citi
zens throughout the Union.
Loving our country, dctemiried to sup
port it, its csnftitution, and the laws ema
nating from itâpleased with the adminiltra
tions of you fir, and your prcdeceffor, who
was and is no less beloved by you than by
ourfelvesâdetelling the parricidical princi
ples of France, which not only seems, but
really arc subverting every government with
in theii vortex, can we be acquainted in
our own minds,â.~ould we be in the opini
on of our fellow citizens, did we hesitate to
made this dsclaration ?
We abhor the modern innovations, and
that word " Reform," which in the fontl
credulity of our imaginations, we believed
to be for the amelioration of the situation of
man, we now fhu:i as we would a monster
ready to engulph all fecial order, annihilate ,
cijril government and subvert the heretofore ;
approved course of things.
If France, compelled by that imperious
necefiity which is some tinyes an apology I
with the historian for a&stending to destroy j
a social compaft could even produce that, 1
an imp-oper prejudice of America might j
(till furaifh her with apologistsâhut when !
wc fee governments never yet obnoxious,
even to fanciful writers, a3 well a$ thufe j
which imagination had formed tyrannical,
and #ur own which has for its balls every
principle preservative of the happiness and
security ot virtue and industry, attempted
to be deftroyed-*-can we resist ths imputfe
of declaring that her nominal government is
an unheard of tyranny âa compadt with
which would as rapidly, and as effe&Ually
destroy our rising empire, as an army of
their Myrmidons might for the moment af
fed our internal order.
If we have not exprefled these opinions
so early as most of our fellow citizen', re
ceive fir, our opologyâfo large an appor
tionment of the county of the county of
Guilford never convened together as on this
day, since the dispatches from our envoys
to Franc# arrived, and delicacy of fentiinent
in those who did, prevented them from Â®b
truding their opinions as of those who did
not.
It is netdlefs to tell you that your admi
nistration has our warmtft approbationâlt j
is needleFs to tell you our determined refo- '
lntion to hipport the measures of that ad
miniflration, and 'tis only from your great '
and well known gnodnefs we can hope an '
excuse for not exprefiing tlicfe opinions be
fore this day.
We believe sincerely with you fir, in a
sentiment lately expressed, that much indeed
of our fafety depends on the exertions used
for the eftablilliing an American Navy, and
that a part of our fellow (pitiaen* cannot be
more beneficially employed than by endea
vouring to perfeA it.
May that kind Providence which has
watched over the liberty and independence J
of the United States,continue its protection t
to you, one of their choicelt guardians, and l
lonfc preserve a life dear and efTentfal to its .
country's happiness.
JOHN HAMIL TON, Chairman. (
Refdved Unanimously,
That this Address be signed by Major '
John Hamilton, the chairman, in behalf of '
this meeting, and that it be transmitted to !
John Steele, Esq. with a request that he
deliver the fame to his excellency the Presi
dent. '

ANSWER. 1
To the Officer: of the Guilford Regiment of J
Militia, and the Inhabitants of the County, '
convened at the Court-house in Marlin-oilie, '
on the 15 th of September, 1798,
gentlemen, /
THE unanimous address adopted by you
has been transmitted to me as you dire&ed, i
by Major John Ham.lton to Mr. Steele, ,
and by Mr. Steele to me.
AddrefTes, like yours, so friendly to me 1
and so animated with public spirit, can nev. r 1
(land in Â»eed of any apology. It is, on the i
contrary, very true, that the afFe&ionate 1
addrtfTes of my fellow-citizens have flowed 1
in upon me, from the various parts of the ]
union, in such numbers, that it has been ut- ,
terly impofiible for me to preserve any regu
larity in my answers, without negUaing ,
the indifpenfablc duties of my office. This/ ,
and a long continued and very dangerous
ficknefsin my family, most fenoufly alarm
ing to me, will, I hope, be accep;ed by you,
and by all others whose favors have not been
duly noticed, as an apology for a seeming
neglect which has been a very great mortifi
cation tojne. There is no language within
my command, fuficient to exprefsthe fatis
faction I have felt, at the abundant proofs
ot harmony And unanimity among the peo
ple, efpÂ«cially in the Southern states, and in .
rione m it reradrkably; than in North-Ca
rolira.
Your patriotic address, adopted cn the
ground where a memorable battle was fought
by freemn, on the 15th of March, 178!,
iri defence of their liberties and support of
their independence, is peculiarly forcible and
affedking.

TO THE PEOPLE OF VIRCINFA.
c Fellow Citizens,
THE Sedition Law is charged also with
r uneonftliuvtSnaiity, because it is supposed
to infringe the freedom cf speech and of the
: press. Let this objedlio 1 be examined,
1 and let our enquiry bs in what instances the
' freedom of speech or of the press is infring
-1 Â«d. As to speech it is no where embraced
j in the law, it being explicitly confined to
malicious defamations in print or writing.
1 This is so apparent that I shall content my
felf merely with referring the attention of
the reader to the words of the law which has
' been literally recited.
The fr-edom of the press has been long :
understood an 1 completely enjoyed in our
' country. It is secured to us by the funda
mental laws of each Hate, and by the go-;
vcrnment of the United States. From the
means which have been taken to preserve i ,
we ipay learn how invaluable it is elleemed
throughout America. Isy t'le third amend
atory article to the conllitution it is provid- â 
1 ed tbat " Congress shall make no law rc
" fpedling an eftablifiiment of religion, ov .
" prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or
" abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
. " press, or the rights ot the people peace- '
" ably to aiTtmblc and to petition the go- ;
" vernment for a redress' of grievancts'" j
! If the law of congress whifh is ncv the sub- 1
; jest of difcullion declares and recognizes the
I freedom of theprefs, a3 it was beliÂ«v*d to ex
-1 i(t in ill the ilate3 when the conllitution
! waÂ« adopted, it is cle ir chat it has not a
| bridged it, and consequently is conllitution
al ; for congress is not restrained from paf
-1 sing any law whatsoever concerning the
â  press, but from palling any laws abridging
, the freedom of the press.
1 The freedom of the press differs from
the licentioufncfs of the press, and tl\e laws
which prohibit and restrain th<e latter, will
always be found to affirm and preserve the
former. Our ideas concerning the liberty
of the press having been originally derived
from the British law, I beg leave to quote
Â» hat a learned and celebrated English judge
. has written on the fubjeft. Sir William
Blackftone fays " the liberty of the prefa
is indeed essential to the nature of a free
state ; but this confifls in laying no previ
ous restraints upon publications, and not
in freedom from censure for criminal matter
â¢wh npuUifhed{ Every freeman has an un
doubted right to lay what sentiments he
pleases before the public : To forbid this is
to destroy the freedom of the press ; but if
he publics what is improper, mischievous, or
illegal, he must lake the consequence of his
own temerity.âTo fubjeft the press to the
| reftriftive power of a licenser, as was for
: mrrly done bsfore and since the revolution,
is to fubjedt all freedom of sentiment to the
prejudice of one man, and make him the
j arbitrary and infallible judge of all contro.
verted points in learning, religion and go
vernment t But to punish as the law does
at present any dangerous and offenfive writ
ings, which, when published, shall, on a
fair and impartial trial, be adjudged of a per
nicious tendency, is necjfary for the prefer,
vation of peace and good order of go'jernmeut
and religion, the only solid foundations of civ:'
liberty. Thus the will of individuals is ft ill
lefc free ; the abuse only" of wi'l is
the objedl of legal punifhment.âNeithr: 13
any restraint hereby laid upon freedom of
thought or enquiry ; liberty of private sen
timent is (till left ; the difieminating,
or iflaking public of bad sentiments, de
ftrirftive of the ends of society, is the crime
which society eorreas." 4 Blackflone's
Com. ij>.
So just has this view of the fcecJom of
ithe press been considered in \rrerica, that
in every state we nave conformed to it, and
in no state are libellous writings exempt
from legal prosecution and punishment. In
Pennfylvaria it has been made a part of an
article in its constitutionâÂ«Â« that the prini
ing prefJes shall be free to every person who
undertakes to examine the proceedings of
the legiftature. or any branch of govern
ment, and no law shall ever be made to re
frain the right thereof. The free communi
cation of thoughts and opinions is one of
the invaluable rights of man ; and every ci
tizen may freely speak, writr and print on
any fubjed, being refportlSble for the abuse of
that liberty" J
This provision in the Pennsylvania con
stitution, adopted in the year 1790, is so
exa&ly like the definition giv*n by
Blackftone of the freedom of the press, as
to furnifh the strongest proof of tbe appro
bation of that state of his sentiments. There
it !s conceived perfeftly compatible with
the l.berty of the press, to make every man
refponfibic to the laws for an abuse of that
liberty ; There libels are deemed fit fubie&s
of legal punifhmcnt, as they are in every
other ovitiaed caunt.v, where any degree
ot rational government exists. There it is
no abridgement of the freedom of &e press to
P u .ni . Â£vtr y PÂ«fon, whÂ« shall, by wrrtine
printing, uttering orpublifhing any falfe or
malicious writing,, defam. the president of
the United States, or congress, or the chief
mag,Urate of that state. Such to-, is ,1k
sense of every other state on this fubied
In very corner of the United State,, the
freedom of the press is alike underttood, in
theory ; and it is every where enjoyed under
f . e P rm fP le ' malicious and wicked
wifehoods may no; be pri U t{d with inpu.

that the. reedom of the press is not abridged
by a law'that declares and limits the Punf(h

such a law .s conftrtted to infringe the free

If it is 110 of the freedom nf
tbe press to pumfti mSirÂ°
11 racy of the United States by taeaâs 0 f The
dilate courts, I cannot perceive that there
will be any abridgement of it to pumfh the
fame kind of libels by means'of the federal
courts. What is punishable as libels by
either tribunal, is admitted to be a public
offence, n public offence against the United
States, for which reason it would seem
nwre properly cogniz ble before the courts
and under the laws of the United Sutes
The constitution of Femifyloania has al.
so provided " that h profecutioa f or the
, publication of papers iuvclligating the offi
cers or men in a public capacity, or where'
tAe matter publiflied is proper for public in
formation, the truth thereof may be given
in in evidence, and in aH n.diftmetits for
; libels, the jury (hall have rijht to determine
; the law and the fafts under the direction of
the court as in other cases " In these res
; pedis the sedition law of o ngrefs alfo
altered the oi l law as it was received in A
j merica. Ui.der it also, the truth may now
: be given in evidence, which before was not
admitted ; and the jury may now detrr
j mine the law and the sacK though before
I thiy could only determine the foas. So
careful hascongrefs been to and cher-" "
lib the freedom of the press by the regula
tions of law, which they have an undoubt-'
ed right to d<J, though thdy are restrained
from abridging.
With this view of the constitution of the
United States, a'id of the principles of the
law, let us particularly attend to what it
has enacled. Ihe sedition law has enafted
that any person after conviftion shall be pu
nished by a fine not exceeding two thoufarid
dollars; and by imprisonment not exceed
ing two year , who ihall write, print, utter
or publish, any faife, fcandabus and mali
cious writing or wtitings, against tire go
vernment of the United Slates, or either
house of congress, or the President, tuM
intent.
i ft. To defame or bring them or either
of them into contempt.
2dly. Of to excite against them or either
of them the hatred of the people ;
3_dly. Or to stir up sedition within the
United State# ;
4thly. 0r to excite any unlawful combf
nations therein for oppefing or refilling any
law of the United States, or any aft of the
Prefideut done in pursuance of such law, or
of the powers in him vested by the confti*
tution ;
sthly. Or to refill, oppose, or defeat any
such law or aft ;
<sthly. Or to aid, encourage, or abet any ...
hostile designs of any foreign nation against:
the United States, their people or govern
ment.
Every thing here enumerated is ?riminal
in itfelf and ought to be prevented ; and sureÂ»
ly to prevent falfe and malicious publiea-,
tions, intended to promote the commiffioo
of such crimes, was the duty of the legifla- *
ture. I repeat it, the law forbids nothing
that a good citizen wifhea to do : It impofea
norellraint on truth, but endeavours tofuf.
press wicksd falfhood.âCan this be deemed
an abridgement of the pressâor rather, is ic
not placing the prefa upon the proper foun
dation to render it a permanent blefling to
society ?
To conclude the point of constitutionality
the rights of the (late, and the" jurifdifti< n
oftheftate court?, retain their full force;
neither are abridged or impaired in their
cognisance us the offences fpecified in the
law. They remain entire and in their for
mer conditionâNor has the freedom of the
press been infringed but it has been declared
and acknowledged as it has ever been under-'
flood to exist in this country. If opinion*
were circulated and acquiring credit in the
community, that it was not, criminal to libel
the the president, or the govern
ment of the United States, this law, by gi
ving seasonable notice to the people of the
â¢errors of such opinions will not fail to p>o
- the moll salutary and beneficial effeft.
upon the cause ef good order and rational
liberty, wrthout which a state of society raiift

guru Such is the account that b.-en sent
jjuiia ome hy Sir Horatio of this moll splen
did action. He would no doubt have
guns entered morc ; nto t h e detail, but he con
guns fldered tKc bulincls as not yet ended,
while a (ingle battery or /hip remained
gUns to be destroyed. Afthr the ,battle ij
> 74 appears that he proceeded inflantly to
guns tizc ou anc ' difinantle the batteries on
(hore, by which he had been annoyed - x
Â» 74 and to employ his whole force in mea
>tain <ures for destroying the trarTports which" ,
were left at Alexandria and Rrjetta.ââ¢'
According to the report made by the
Hon. Capt. Capel, these measures were
taken with such (kill, and executed with
such alacrity, that it was thought very
few, if any, of them would escape, and i
the whole armament amounted to 350
vefiels. So complete a deftru&ion has i
nen ' nftt occurred in the annals of our mari- 1
Jmi- time glory, llnce the overthrow of thy ]
nder an Armada ; and though the bat
tle was fought at so great a distance from
our shores, in its confluences it may be
nt little less auspicious to England, fmce it
n. is manifeft that the armament was di
â¢rn.l rcÂ£ted against a vital part of out empire, 1
ped. t^ie French General might have (
reached his destination. It is m vain to (
deny that they are formidable by' land, 1
sed, however contemptible by sea; and we '
)cl '' have reason to thank our glorious ma- '
It I * Â°
nne that we have been able to check the 1
progress of their career on our own ele- '
ment. We consider their career as
completely checked, for it will now be '
impossible for Buonaparte to proceed to 1
his India. Ministers jefterday, along with (
Sir a ftiort extract of the news, published
' the following information : i
"Buonaparte was at Cairo, complete- t
:er, at variance with all his officers, who t
35. are discontented with the expedition.â f
â¢d ' I crs are sickly, and poisoned 1
' j with the water of the country. \
na- " Grand Signior is making every I
na- effort to collect a force to cut off supplies. f
I Buonaparte's dispatches are taken." c
aa- t
33* I
We understand that these dispatches Â£
er, stated to the Directory, that without re- a
'â 9â¢ inforcements it would be impossible for b
t0 P or evan t0 maintain his I
polltion at Cairo tor any length of time, ii
. l as inhabitants in general were ijitimi si
:n, cal to his progress. p
ie, But to return to the vittory
B'l 8 'I As commodore Trowbridge, in the
13 Culloden, unfortunately got afliore be
ia- fore the action, and though he made eve- "
I exertion, was unable to participate in the 'i
>a- glory of the fight, this reduced the two i
-1 lines of battel to an equality in point of th
13 numerical force; but in weight of me- 7
17 J tal, number of guns iind men, of sri-
J gates and gun boats, and in the materi- a ]
al cirfumftances of batteries on Ihore,
73 J I'rench had greatly the advantage, tb
IâThe French had three 80 gun ships,
I and one ot 120 guns, whereas -we had U|
t. none of higher than 74's. The French T
hatl "9Â° guns, the Englig only 1012, ill
t and frÂ° m that number a deduction must ~e
Ibe made of the Culloden's seventy
's four gÂ«ns, as (he was unable to take f 0 j
n. any part in the aftion. Vfhcn these efl
1- things are considered, and it is reflefted ; n
J that the English Admiral run close in co
i- {hore t0 ma|| the attack on a fleet
r C moored to receive him; that the hattle J,
n. was fought at night, and that but two na
ri out of thirteen of the enemy's ships en- 'â¢
f ; gaged escaped, it is in all its charaaers, ou
a most splendid victory.
It was also, as remarkable, we wil
[â¢ understand, for single afts of he- gÂ«
> roifm Â» as for the general display th<
e of gallantry. Captain Darby, in
the -Bellerophon, of 74 guns, at- v iÂ£
tacked the L'Orient, of 120 sing- fioi
â¢. 'y> an d burnt her j it was in the tlle
, explosion of this (hip that he loft
so many of his officers and men.
1 here many prisoners cor
r made, that fir Ho
. ratio determined to pur them a- b y
. Oiore as soon as he had completed ft , a!
i the destruction of the transports.* the
, Of the two frigates that efcap- hav
ed one was afterwards taken at
. Rhodes.
J 1 here is no account of the ar
â¢ rival of the two line of battle A
. j ships which escaped, and the other
â  frigate, having arrived at any port hT"
in France, and it is therefore pro- rtrm
â  â  bable they may also fall into our Adr
, hands, and complete,the deftruc- d<
j tion oiF the whole. ~'
i lhe French Admiral's ship,
1 1 Orient which was blov, - n up, had t
on board it appears, 1010 men.â "i' lo '
Admiral Bruey's himfelf who com
manded her, and the Captain on
; board, were both killed before
.*'-.Â»'i- x - * ? â¢ â¢ â¢ Â»
~ent she took fire. On.board this ship j
[en- was the whole of the treasure ta- J
ave ken by the French at Malta, which j
on- was very considerable. . The num,!

led the other French ship which was
'}. hurntj is stated in the Gazatte to
â¢to be 700'; and the crews of i'Arte
on niife frigate burnt, and ie Serictjfe

ea- tal loss of the French is estimated ' 1
ich" four and five thouland; I ]

3m Extraft of a Letter from on board
be the Orion, dated Bequier road, -j
. i t August 9.
di- " Sir Horatio Nelson has sent an
re, officer to India, with the account
(ve of the victory ; lieutenant Duval, j
t0 of the Zealous, is charged with his 1
id, dispatches, and let oft yesterday in a
we a urkilh boat which was to land
ia- him in Syria, on his way to Alep
he po : a velfel detained the day ba
le- fore with diipatches and letters
a 5 from Buonaparte's army at Grand
b e Cairo, will make the admiral's "
t0 diipatches still more interesting to
ith our settlements in India, as they all
ed tend to represent the French army *
in the mod difaltrous situation, as '
well from the services they have
te- undergone in their march across I
ho the sandy, deserts, as from the de- jj
predations of the Mamalukes and
ed Arabs, and also from deprived of "
v. ine and jpirits, without which the n
ry French trbops find it next to im- 13
possible to refill the excessive heat, P
or endure fatigue. Jt appeers that
Buonaparte meant to proceed to "
es Suez, and demanded transports e
e- and craft to meet him on the Nile; [
or but when he hears the defeat of the h
lis French Fleet, it will throw him \
e, into despair, particularly as the
ni squadron of Sir Horatio Nelson r '
- proposes to keep up there, will ef- 1
fe&ually cut off for some time, all 1

, The demenllraiiong of joy last night were
univtifal, and continued ;o a late hour,
h ThÂ« Admiralty Office lit ihe example of an 01
I, illumination, wh : ch immediately became ge
ft neral, and which is expedled so take (lace
again this nfgt.
We rejeice to leirn that Ministers are re- rn
f solved to make our great Naval superiority I
e efle&ual to the renovation of our commerce f- 1
d in Mediterranean and the Levant : a eit
n compadl is entered into with the Kir g < f
Naples, by which the ports of Sicily are to
be put into our poff;(Son for the defence of
e his dominions., and fcr the pnrpofts of our
3 naval operations in th< fie seas. Gen. Stewart
. iÂ« a dually gone to take the commaad. and
our troops lately in Portugal are on their ~
' way thither. A most critical pod will be
thus e(lablifhed. The blockade of Malta
3 will be formed and continued without dan
. ger to our ships, as they will take Ihelter in
r the potts of Meffina.tnd Syracuse, and hopes pr <
are even entertained that the islands will
! fa 1 into eur hands. The fii ft fruits of this
â  victory may be its furrrndt , and its polTef
â¢ (ion would greatly faci itate the recovery of l ' ei
. the Levant trade. tl) "
In this view at least, this great event
ought to be confidcred as one of the mod
valuable, as it certainly is the molt Alining
corquell we have gained. Fvsry man who
either has a guinea at (lake, or is in hopes,
by his i"diiflry and exertions, to acquire a
(lake in the country, ought Jo feel proud of n
the elevation which our fleets have given to
the Britilh name, and in the security they
have conferred en the Britilh (hores.
