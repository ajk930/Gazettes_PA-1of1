To JOHN R UT'LEDGE,jun. Esq. Capt.
of the Charltjlan Volunteer Company.
SIR,
THE members of the Charleston Volun
teer Company, under the painful idea of be
ing feparfcted from a commanding officer who
pofleflea the esteem and confidence of every
individual of that corpt, would be nnjult to
their own feelings, as well at to your merit,
were they lilehtly to past over that event.
It was therefore unanimoufiy tefolved, af
ter you retired from the last meeting of the
company, that a Committee (hould, in their
name, make their acknowledgements to you
for the propriety of your conduit in the com
mand of the company, ever since its firft in.
ftitution, and for your polite attention to ev
ery member of it.
Nocitizens would mors deprecateany unwar
rantable measures being pursued, that might
tend to involve thiscountryin a war, than the
( Volunteer! ; but should the independence of
America ly infringed, or herJawt violated,
they pledge themselves to be amonglt the
foremoll tÂ» fuppott the present Federal Gov
ernment and its laws, against any set of men
or country that may attempt to overturn the
one or trample on the other.
While we finccrely regret the loft which
we ftiffer by your absence, it affords us much
consolation, that the fame patriotism and abi
lities, to which we now pay a just tribute, are
fiill to be employed in the public ferviee in a
poit of mare importance ; and we anticipate
with pleasure the moment wheu thousands of
our fellow-citizens (halljoinwithus in applau
ding your fcrvicea.
Attaehed to you as an officer for the rea
sons we have assigned, and as a citizen for
qualities ire have observed, but which it
might appear adulatory to make mention of,
we take leave of you with thefincrreft wilhe6
for your future liappinefs and honor j and we
trust you will believe us equally sincere when
we declare, that none in the circle of your
connexions will be more happy to welcome
your returu tt> Carolina than the Charleston

CAPT. RUTLEDGE'S ANSWER.
Gentlemen,
I THANK the Charleston Volunteers
mod sincerely for their very affeftionate ad
irefs. Although clrcumftanccs have placed
the affairs of the United States in a fituatidn
peculiarly embarraffirig, yet I trust the wis
dom and pradence of our government will
speedily efleft jn honorable adjustment of the
differences which unhappily fubfilt between
us and the French Republic. But it Ame
lica (hall not be permitted to continue a.t
peacÂ», vrrthout fufTeripg a violation of. her
rights, I flatter myfelf her citizens will be
unanimous and zealous in supporting their in
dependense and felf government. They are
too wife not to prefer their interests to those
of any other nation, and much too brave not
to protest with republicao valour and enthu
siasm the liberties for which mod of them
have fought and many have bled to cftablith.
In ihe event of any attempt beiÃg made to
inhinge or subvert them, I anr. perltaded the
Zealand patriotism of the Charleston Volun
Steers will equal that of any of their fellow
i citizens. Accept, I beg of ybu, gentlemen,
my thanks for the very ready obedience
which every individual of the corps has paid
| to my otders during the fix years I have had
the honor of commanding ir, and for the
j alertness with which they have assembled in
J the firft moments of alarm. The kiad wiÃ
es you express for my health and happiness
are extremely grateful to me,, and I recipro
cate them very sincerely to every officer and
private of the corps.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, May 22.
In a committee of the whole, Mr. Dent in
the'chair, on the answer reported to the Presi
dent's speech.
(Mr. Nicholas's Jpetch concluded from our lafl.)
The difference, Mr. Nicholas said, be
twixt the address reported, and the proposi
tion he had brought forward was this; the
former approved all the measures of the Ex
ecutive, and the latter recommended an en
quit y relative to the operation of the British
treaty. It was this queflion upon which the
committee would decide, and it was of im
portance, he said, that they (hould weigh
thecaufe of difference betwixt us and the
French republic, and hot decide that we are
right, without examination, because if after
beisg brought to hoftiiity, we are obliged to
retradl, it would fitew our lormer folly and
wantOÃnefs.
Mr. N. said he would enquire into the
rights of France as they refpefted three prin
cipal fubjeds, which were particular causes
of complaint between the two countries.
Tbefe were the right of our'veffels carrying
English goods, the article refpediing contra
band goods, and that refpedting the carrying
of provisions. He knew no better way to
determine how far we could funport those
articles of the Britilh treaty, than by extract
ing the arguments of our own ministerial
charaflers in support of thtfe measures.
With refpedl to the question of free ships
making free goods, his impreffiuiis were very
different from those of the Secretaiy of
State. He said with refpeft to the regula
tion of free ships making free goods it is not
changing a right under the law of nations ;
that had never been pretended to be a right
and that ourhavingagrced to it in one instance
and uot in another was no just cause of com
plaint by the French government. He ad
vocates this tranfaflion in his letter to Mr.
Adet lafl winter. Mr. N. said 'he knew
not what was the origin of the law of nations
upon the fubjeft ; he knew not how it came
into existence ; it had never been fettled by
any convention of nations. Perhaps, how
fver, the point now under confederation came
as near to a fixed piincipaf, as any other of
what are called the .laws ol nations ever did,
as only one nation in Europe could be ex
cepted from the general underflanding of it.
Mr. Pickering, he thought,-feemed not to
have given full force to this circumstance ;
but seemed to have weakened the evidence.
[He referred to what Mr. Pickering had said
upon the fubjeftj It was Mr. P's idea that
the stipulation of free ships making free
goods, was a mere temporary proviGon ;
that it was not an article in the law of
nations but a new principle inttoduced by
the cantradling parties. In order to prove
this was not the cafe, Mr. Nicholas referred
to the provisions entered into by the armed
neutrality of the north of Europe; to a treaty
betwixt France and Spain, to a note from
the court of Denmark, and to the declara
tion of the United States themselves on the
fubjedt.
In his mind therefore, Mr. N. said, it be
come in some degree certain that this fljpu
lotion was an article of the hw of nations,
and that an abandonment of it, as a neutral
power, was 20 abandonment of neutral
ground.
But, said he let us cpr fider the circum
(lances under which this treaty was made ;
let us fee whether it is the law of nations
or not. It was the intention of the parties
to make the bw of nations as free as in theit
power ; and if we chufe to abandon the'prin
cipal of free ships making free goods, shall
we call upon France to do the fame ? This
did not appear confident with justice.
[uftice seemed to require en oppofne course
If we could not maintain this stipulation with
all the world, we are bound to allow France
the fame privileges whii'j we allow to any
otl-tr nation. It was not for the interest of
this country to irfift upon the fulfilment of
bad treaties, to do which would be a greater .
lofj than benefit. In the treaty with Great !
Britain, we had denied the r!Â«h r that free
(hips make free goods. it was indeed wholly
up, but we agree that it fhou'id be sus
pended during tke prif.'nt war. He thought
this wrong, and asked if any country, who
granteed a privilege tc one nation which they
refufed to another, could pretend to any
firmnefs in their proceedings ? He thought,
they could not.
With refpedt to contraband articles he had
little to fay. It was aflerted that the arti
cles stipulated in the Britilh treaty as contra
band, were made so by the law of naions.
Where the dedtrinc was found he conld not
Ly. It had been quoted from Vattel; this
authority might be correft ; but he never
found any two writeis on this fubjedt agree
as to this article. In a late publication oil
the law of nations (Marian's) he found it
diredlly afleited that naval (lores were not
contraband. But he said, if the contrary
were the law of nations, they were bound to
extend the fame privilege to France which
they gave to England; they could not have
one rule for the one nation, and a different
one for the other.
The 18th article of the British treaty, re
fpedUng the carrying of provifioni, always
(truck him as a very important one. It had
heretofore been contended that this article
did not go to any provisions except such as
were carrying to befteged or blockaded place*;
but he believed the British had constantly
made it a pretence for seizing provisions go
ing to Fiance. Indeed, if he was not mis
taken, the British minister had publicly de
clared in the House of Commons, that the
provifionson board the vtflels intended for the
Quiberon expedition, has been supplied from
what had been captured in American veflels.
Mr. N. contended that this was the opini
on' of the Executive of this country, as pub
lished in all the public papers, and of course
known to the government of France. In the
letter of Mr. Jeffarfon to Mr. Pinckney in
1793, he declares that there is only one cafe
in which provisions are contraband, and (hews
the ne'eeffity of a neutral nation observing the
fame rules towards all the powers at war.
But, in the present cafe, the right was ceded
during the present war.
It was an unfortunate circumstance againfl
the neutrality of this country to find a doc
trine so differently applied at different times.
It was a strong proof of the progress of the
palllons. It might be confidercd as a frau
dalent thing, in one instance, to give up a
right for a ccmpenfation to ourselves.
But Mr. Pickering, in his ebfervations
upon this circumstance, fays, that thi* flipu
lation is really a beneficial thing to France,
as it encourages mercantile adventures ; Lit
this Mr. N. deried, and said, that TF it en
couraged adventure,it would rffo increase the
facility of captures.
In considering the tendency of the amend
ment he had piepofed, he had not
spoken of the possible operations of agreeing
to the answer, as reported, cfpeciallv when
carried, by a small majority of that house, and
contrary to the wishes of a great part of the
people of the United States. If the measure
were carried by two, three, Â£ve, 01 ten votes,
did gentlemen expedt that this would answer
their purpose! However the people may
have the virtue to go with the decision of go
vernment, he believed, in a mafute thus car
ried they would obey unwillivly. Yet how,
was this division in opinion to be avoided ?
He did not believe the conduft of the Ex
ecutive of our government had always been
equal to the different powers at war, and
therefore could not fay so. Indeed, he could
not conceal his fentitnents upon the business;
they had frequently been expressed, and were
he now to hold a different language, he might
bejuftly br inded with infamy.
Let fometliing, then, said Mr. N. be
brought foi ward which does not stare in the
face the established Â©pinions of many mem.
bers of that House ; but perhaps it maybe
thought of little conlequence what are the
opinions of those members ; but he believed
the people at large were not less divided in
their opinions than the members in that House
âand a measure so carried, he conceived, was
net calculated to intimidate an enemy. He
knew his constituents would go into the war
if direftecj to do so, but they would exercise
the power which the constitution has placed
in them, of difplaeing from their feats the
men who had involved them into such difficul
ties. He knew that if a war was to take place,
that t(ie discontents of the people would in
crease every day. He knew they would aban- 1
don the delisacy and nicety of feeling which
was now urged. He knew it was his duly
to take as moderate ground as was confident,
because he knew the public opinion, though '
now irritated above it, would come down to '
it.
If it were of confcquenee that the people '
(hould enter unanimoully into any hoAile mea
lure which eventually might be found neceflary '
(though he hoped and trulted it would not) he !
thought that unanimity might be l'ecured by a- 1
greeing to thepropofition which he lud moved. ! â 
In making conceflions to England it was not 1 !
considered as difgraceful; what was now wish- ,
ed, wai thai England and France might be pat ;
upon the fame footing with refpeit to this eoun- 1 {
try. To do this was the only way in which :
unanimity could be obtained, and it appeared '
to him that there cou}d be no serious ol>'eisHofi
to it.
It may be said, and probably will, that this
proportion interferes with the business cf the
executive, and that we ought not to diflate to
him wiÂ»h refptil to the proper ileps to be tak- r
en. He vas so well accuitomed to the business '
of the House, that he knew gentlemen would C
entrench themfclves under the pretended reflrie- '
tions cf the conflitution ill this refpcdl ; but it
was his opinion that the measure which he pro- F
poled was ftriftly conftifjtional. The Prefi- v
dent was to negotiate, but it was the duty of the -'
legislature to deliberate on the proper measures 11
to be taken. Government, he said, could neverbe '
carried on, unless the executive and legislature 3
were influenced by the fame fpirii. The Prefi- '
dent might go cn forever to negotiate, if he did c
it contrary to the views of the other branches :
of government, without coming to anyconclu- ''
fioif. It Â«as ahfolutely neccfeiry, therefore, 1
that such a power (hould tx;A, a in) it w - s n âj
poiTible that any danger (hould arise from it 3
And if i propofhioa of tbis kir.d v.-;; not agreed
. to. they had no evidence toiuppofe very c. nci-
I liatory steps would be taken, they had tial'cn,
, indeed, to suppose the contrary.
He was afr.Â»id lie might be charged with go
ing into irritating circumstances, but he did not
cx;.c<a, from the persons with whom the Prefi
den: might be l'uppofed to advise, that very mo
dejate iteps would he taken. It was not to be
fuppol'ed i hat tliey would abandon the opinions
they had so ftrenuinfly maintained. He tho't,
therefore, it was the bulinelvof that House to
' fay that- in rheir opinion, it is proper that such
and such steps (hould he taken.
Mr. Nicholas concluded with observing.that
he hid gone over the fubjtft he feared, net
without being considered tetiiousby the commit
tee ; but he felt himtelf greatiy. interelted in
the present decision. He believed any addition
al irritation in their measures, woii'.d place peace
out of our reai h j he believed, therefore, it was
their business to avoid it ; he believed it would
be for the honor and the happine& of the coun
try to do so.
Mr. W. Smith said, aÂ« the pentleinan, last
up had taken a wide range ot arguipent, he must
excuse him, if h? contiued hin.felt in reply to
those parts of his observations only wjfich ap
peared to him effcntially to relate to the iubjeit
uuder consideration.
He believed the quefiion was, whether they
fhculd alter the report in the manner proposed j
that is, whether they ihouid strike out words
which exprefledthe sensibility of this houfe'at the
unprovokedinfults offered by the French Repub
lic to our government and country, or adopt the
gentleman's amendment, which he read.
If they agreed to this amendment, they must
necessarily expert from the French Kepublic freih
insult and aggreflion ; for it seemed to admit that
hitherto no insult had been iatendedÂ»
The amendment might be divided, Mr. S.
said, into two parts. The firft went to vindi
cate the French from any intentional insults tow
ards this country ; it even held out an idea that,
the Executive ought to offer some concessions to
France, and even detonated the kind of concef..
fion. He should, therefore, without taking no
tice of what the gentleman had said about the
political parties Â«f this country, or what he had
said refpeAing himi'elf perfonaily, confine liia
observations to the points in qutftion. ,
The firft point was whether the condudt of
France was juftifiable in refufing our minister,
and ftnding hi ai from the Republic in the man-,
ner they had done ?
He thought the committee had abundant ma
terials before them completely io refute the firft
propofitiou ; and he was furpnzed, knowing
that these documents weie in the hands of every
member, that the gentleman from Virginia cojld
expert to impress their minds with the idea'that
no indignity whatever had been offered by thÂ«
Fremh government to this country in that trant
artion.
Mr. Smith said, that it appeared rroft clearly
that the French Dirertory intended to treat this
Government with marked indignity ; for the'
the gentleman from Virginia fuggetted an opi
nion, that their refufal tÂ» receive Mi. Pinck
ney, was owing altogether te his not being in
veiled with extraordinary powers ; this was e
vidently not the cafe, as the Directory had been
well informed as to the chararter in which Mr.
Pinckney came, before they received his letters
of credence, as appears by the Jetters or M. De.
la Croix to Mr. Monroe, ltiling Mr. Pinckuejr,
bis Succrflhr, and by other documents commu
nicated by the President, (which he read.)ââ¢
There was no doubt, then, with refpert. to the
Dirertory being well acquainted with the cha
rarter in whjch Mr. Pinckney went to France,
viz. as Miniiter Plenipotentiary, or Ordinary
Minister; but after keeping him in fufpence
near two months, on the day after the newsar-"
rived of Buonaparte's fucreffes in Italy, he wai
ordered by a peremptory mandate in writing, to
leave the French republic. This mandate waÂ»
accompanied by a circumfUftce which was cer
tainly intended to convey an insult; it was ad
dressed as an Anglo-American, a term,
it is true, they sometimes use to diftiuguifh the
i inhabitants of the United States from thole of
the Well-India iflaeds, but, in his opinion, here
evidently designed as a term of reproach, as he.
believed no other similar instance could be men-,
tioned. Upon this circumftanee, however, he
laid no stress, the other indignities which our
minister had received were too great to require
any weight to be giyen to this circumftanee.
But, fays the gentleman from Virginia, after
the Dirertory had l'een his Letters of Credence,
end discovered that he had no power to make
concisions, they lefufed to acknowledge him.
What would he have required his letters of cre
dence to have said ? were theynot " faithfully
to reprefetit the difpofitiou of tiie Government
and People of the United States, cheir difpoliticn
bcing;one, to remove jealcufies and obviate com
plaints, by Clewing that they were groundlefj,
to restore that mutual confidence which had
been so unfortunately and injurioully impaired,
and to explain the relative interests of both coun
tries, and the real sentiments of his own."
W hat raore than this could have been fjtidin
letters of Credence ? But, adds the gentleman,
his InJiruHions did not authorize him tÂ® make a- â¢
ny concefiion.or to fatisfy their complaints with
refpert toexifting treaties. How dots he know
this > Will the gentleman undertake to fay that
his. inftrurtions uid not give him this power.?
It certainly would not have been proper to have
stated in his letters of credence what he was au
: therized to concede ; or to exhibit to the French
Government his inllrurtions until it was known
what they were difpofrd to do. We had com
plaints to make as well as they. They had
committed fpolhtions on our commerce to a
great amount. Was it right, then to fay in
stantly on his arrival, Â« I am come to offer von
all these coiiceflions," without knowing what
I they were difpof-d to offer in return ? Will the
gentleman undntaks to fay, it would have been
right to have communicated h s private in
luufltons to the Dirertory even before he was
! received ? If we were a Colony of France, indeed
it might have been expected that he would have
laid not only his n.Â»rurti6ns, but pro it rated
himftrlf at the feet of the Directory, bu: 4r.deÂ»
pendent as we are, he truftcdno gentleman would
|ay this was proper ir. any man, much Ids was
it to be exported from Mr. Vinckuey. What
were his private inftrurtion, was unknown. A 1
thousand conjerttires might be formed refueling
tnera, but they were vague and uncertain.
This being the state of the tranfartion, he
thought it clearly eftablilhed, that 'Mr Pmck
ney was not refufed becaufc he bore -'he charac
ter of minister Plenipotentiary, without extra
ordinary powers ; the queition then was, why
was he lent away I 1
Wc all, said Mr. Smith, remember the com

the Uii.ted 3ta: s, until "fur the reclrefs of the h.
grievances demanded of the Ameriran govern- w
inent, and which thfPrcnch rcpub!ic.has a right ' c<

Now, wr.at, K>h. S. a(ketl, were the grievances di
contained in Mr. Adet's note, and to wiach the bi
directory here refer ? They were viry numer- c<
- dus ; but they chicSy fell uu.*r trie four heads th
he had mentioned. According then to this de- to
duration of ti.e French government, what were ol
we to do ? We mu(t, said he, annul the Briti(h hi
treaty; rrpeal the law of June 1794, which was F
lal) leifion very unanimously te-enafted ; and
we niuft, by some proceeding or othe-, which tl
he supposed even the ingenLj.ty of the gentle- ' t j.
manfrom Virginia would find it difficult to point â¢
out, annul the decrees of the courts of the Uni- I "
trd States. Yet though all this mnft be done, | ri
before the directory would condescend to receive
our miniller, the gentleman did not believe any hi
iiuhgiity whativer had Iwen intended againit la
this government ; and we must not express our- Q |
feivei as ir we thought or felt there had been q
any. It was, at the belt, a mere matter of eti- .
quetic on the part of France, it was meant to
tolivey no insult, no indignity; our govern- '
men( had given offence by failure of etiquette, a J
and therefore, to heal the breich, we muit fsnd cÂ«.
an envoy extraordinary to make the neceflary til
cunceHions, and all will go well. :
With rtfpeil to the gentleman's second pro- Jj (
pofitiew, if i: was proper to be dtfeuffed at all,
it would have been more properly difcufied in a w .
committee of the whole on the Sate of thr- Un- Vl
ion, after proper notice and being printed. If th
(be House cannot confide in the Executive that th
It -vil! ta!;e the proper measures to heal the to
â wound ; if the lioufe were convinced that the 2I
tjecniive were not disposed to dÂ» this, it might
h< then their 4u'y to apply to him ; but the Pre- "
fijent, in his speech, had explicitly said, that it
Was his mod sincere desire to restore harmony, tr
Â»d that, notwithftandmgthe indignities offered b<
ta our minister and our government, he did not gi
tjiink thr honor and dignity of our government b<
forbad farther advances towards negotiation.
After fir candid and free a declaration, he was p
flrprifed ao hear his difpofi-ion in this relpeift
tlus called in qneftien. For his part, Mr. S. c<
flld, hs had not the lead hesitation to believe, h
diat thÂ« executive would go all lengths confid- tl
with the honor and dignity of the country, h
to restore harmony between the two republics, â
teeaufe he was fatisfied he had the interest of the
country at heart, and he traded that no gentle
jaaii, not even the gentleman from Virginia
Umfelt, would doubt this. a
It had been argued that this country had not
Â»a,d a proper part with refpefl to France. In I Â«
Â®rderto (hew this, the member had adverted to ti
three fpecific grounds of complaint ariling out â
â¦f the Britilh treaty. Â« u
The gentleman from Virginia htd eonfined
the complaints of the French government to
three articles of the British treaty ; though, if ''
the committee referred to the letter of Mr. De f<
U Croix, it would be found that they did not o
confine them within so narrow a compass. tl
They complained, fird, of the inexeeution of
treaties j there are several poir> ts of complaint
lelative to that head. ad. Complaints againd P
the decrees of our federal courts j 3d, againd "
the law of June 1794 ; and 4th, against the "
treaty with Great Britain : Yet the gentleman t
confines hirafalf altogether to the latter. And f
really he did not expeit at this time of day, as- ,]
ter the fubjeit had been so fully discussed, and f
determined, and the objeflions refuted over and
over again, that any gentleman would haveÂ£n
deavored to revive and prove their complaints
outhis head well founded.â The three articles 'â¢ v
were, id. That free (Hips did no! make free h
!oods. ad. The contraband article. 3d. The f
rovifion article. n
1. The flipulation with refpeit to neutral j,
tflels not making neutral goods in the Britilh
treaty was not contrary to the law of nations ; ,
at only provided that the Uw of nations was to *
be carried into effeift in the manner mod con- v
venient for the United States.. But this doc- g
trine, he said, wa* uo new thing. It had been t
acknowledged mod explicitly by Mr. Jefferfon, ;
Secretary of State, in July 1793, and was fode
claredtotheminiflerof France ;yet no objection
wasmade to it until the Bnti(h treaty was ratifi- v
<d, though long previous thereto French pro- \
jiertv was captured on board our velTels. Mr. 1
Jtfferfon writing on this fubjeit to the French t
Sinister, said " You have no (hadew of com- I
ain* the thing was so perfeflly clear and ,
\iell undsrftood by the law of nations. This j
jtippened so long ago as July or Augud 1793. .
Bit two years afterwards, when the British.
treaty was promulgated, the whole country was '
tirown into a flame by admitting this very I
fame doflrine. France herfelf had always adt- t
eil unde/ this law of nations when not retrained
3 ; treaty ; in Valin's ordinances of France this ,
early appears. The armed neutrality was
ekinfiued to the then exifling war ; Ruflia her- \
ft If, the creator Â«f the armed neutrality, enter
ed into a compafl with England in 1793, ex
yrefsly contravening its principles. The prin
ciple was theÃ not edablifhed by our treaty with
i ngl 'id ; but such being the acknowledged
lr.wof nations, it wa3 merely dipulated that it
fliÂ»uld be exercised in the manner the lead inju
rious
a. The next article of complaint was with
refpefi to contraband goods. If gentlemen will
consult the law of nations, they will find, that
die articles mentioned in the Britilh treaty a>e
by the law of nations contraband articles. They
will find that in all the treaties with Denmark
and Sweden, Great Britain had made the fame
iipulations. Indeed the gentleman had ac
knowleged, that it was so dated by some writers
on the law of nations ; but he wilhed to dero
gate from the authority of those writers, in the
fame way as Mr. Genet, in his correspondence
-with Mr. Jefferfon, had called them worm eat
<ea folifi'j nnd mufly apborifms { to Vattel might
be aJdÂ«d Valm's ordinances, a very refpecUhle
vÂ»ork in Fiance. HÂ«w, then, can the gentle
man with truth fay we have deviated from the
itwof nations ?
3. The lad point which the gentleman took
notice of was the prov'Jt9n article I here was
* r.i> doubt that this government would nevir al
low provisions to be contraband, excrpt when
gcing to a besieged or blockaded port. Tho
lit made this declaration, yet It was but aandid
to acknowledge that this was stated by Vattel to
he the law of nati&ns* [[He read an extract
â¢from Vattrl ]
When this was stated by I-ord Grenville to
Mr- I'inckney, our then minister in London,
* Mr. Pinckney acknowledged it to be foliated in
Vattel,but very ingeniously argued, that Fi'anse
caul'd not be considered as in the fituatio.i men
tii ned in Vattel, since p-ovifions were cheaper
they were in England, and therefore
the cafe did not apply< When our envoy was
loit to London, both parties were tenacious on
this ground. Our minister was unwilling tp a
to this conftrvic\i"M of the law of nations,
bet the Blilifli minister insisted upon it, and if
til-re had not beriijomecomprati.i!;', thenego
tiiiion must hive brer. br~ktn off, and a war
I'fotjably enfucd. 7he refutt wis, therefore |
M>st, without admitting it to be the law of ia c
t'pns, it was.-agreed thai wiiete >rov fions we*'e
contra! and by the law of nations, they (h ruld '
be paid (or, but not-confifcated, as the av o '
nations (admitting that con.truSion) woul I /
have authorised. Therefore some advantage /
was it-cured to Fiance, for if Great Britain bad I.
confiicated our veftelsgo ng to France with pro
vilions, it would certainly have damped the ar |
dor of our citizens employed in that commerce |
but under this regulation, our merchants were
certain of being paid for their cargoes, whether 1
they arrived in France or were carried in- P
to England. These were the three grounds of 15
obje&ion which the gentleman from Virginia o
bad stated as grounds of complaint by the tl
French ajjainft ihe British treaty. t |
Before he vreat furtlier, he would observe,
that admitting (which he did not admit) j
that there had been grounds of objec
tion against the British treaty, before it was j
ratified, yet they ought now to be closed. It j
had received a full discussion at the time ; ii
had been carried into effedk, was become the
law of the land, and waÂ» generally approve'd
of by the country. Why, then, endeavor to
stir up the feelings of the public againd it by n
alledging it to be the just catife of complaint i v
If the committee wanted any proof of the t |
approbation which that inftrttment had re
ceived, lie thought it might be gatheicd from ..
the general approbation which had been
given of the adminillration of the late Pre- f
fident on hisrettrment from office, in doing
which, the people had doubtless taken into Q
viÂ»\v the whole of hit condutt. Nor did he r(
think the people had Ihewn any hostility to
the treaty in their late eleftion of members
to that house. Indeed, he believed that the a ,
approbation whi.h the treaty received, in- ti
creased in propostion as the fuAjeft came to p
be uudtrilood. Admitting further, that the ( j
treaty had changed the exi'tin* (late of thiiigs rt
between Great Btitaii: and France, by having
granted commercial favois to Great Britain, t|
by the 2d article of our treaty with France, t i
the fame favors would immediately attach to
France, so that (he could have no reason to t|
complain on that ground. Indeed France
had herfelf now modified the treaty betwixt f,
that country and this, and had taken to
herfelf what (he deemed to be the favors g
granted to Great Britain. (Mr. S. read the j
decree on this fubjett of 2d March last) j
Mr. Smith said, he believed he had cx- â
amined all the obfervationt of the gentleman t
from Virginia, relative to the treaty, which #
were eiTential to the fubjeft under confidera- t
tion. He did not with to go much farther t
on the present occasion becaofc he agreed v
with him, that it was proper they (hould keep v
themselves as cool and calm as the nature of
the cafe would admit; but he thought whilst c
so much deference was paid to the feelings -]
of France, some relpeft ought to be paid to t
the feelings of America. He hoped the f
people of America would always retain a a
proper refpedt and confideratiou for their 3
national character ; and however earnestly <j
he wished that the differences fubfilling be- c
tween the two countries might be amicably {
fattled, yet, he truded, that our national c
dignity would never be at so law an ebb, as to a
fuhmit to the insults and indignities of anynn- t
tion whatever. In faying tins,heexpreffed his j
heaity wi(h to keep the door of negociation c
: witn France unclosed ; but at the fame time f
lie ilrongly iccommended 'O take every necef. ]
fary dep to place us in a fnuation to defend t
ourTelves, provided she (hauld (till perfilt in %
her haughty demeanour. t
He truded they would convince the c
French and every oilier naiion, that they r
were determined to preserve the right of felf- (
government, and that they were able to fruf- c
trare eveiy attempt which (hould be made to
influence our councils. That such attempts (
had been made he knew some gentlemen ,
would deny, but to him it was evident that )
all the minillers of France, who had resided (
in this country, had endeavoured to obtain an
undue influence over our affairs. It was now |
become a serious question whether we were
to make concefiions to France of the mod
humiliating nature, and thereby provoke j
future aggressions, or aft a firm and determin
ed part, in expressing our indignation at
their insults, and resolving to resist them if
they were petfifted in.
He did not wifli unneceflarily, he said,
to excite indignation ; but it was necessary,.
on this occasion, to take particular notice of
the insulting speech of President BarraÂ«, in
reply to Mr. Monroe's valedictory, a speech
evidently calculated to separate tba Ameri
can people from their government.
After the Directory knew that Mr. Mon
roe was no longer the Miniller of this coun
try, after, he had presented his letters of
recall, and Mr. Pinckney had presented
[ his letters of credenceâafter the Mini Her of
Foreign Affairs, De la Droix, had said that
they considered America as having no Minis
' ter in France, the Piefident of the Direftory
delivered the insulting speech above alluded
to, ia which he tells our late Minister, at a
5 public audience, in the presence of feviral
. Foreign Miriideri, to go home and tell his
: government " that tit country owes itt liberty
" to France." Wfc have never denied, said
" Mr. S. that we receiveJ great services from
1 France i but was it not degrading to this
country that their late Mi> ifter (hould be
c thus addressed. This address was through
out couched in terms (ludioufly marked with
k indignities to this country, and an attempt
Â» to separate the people from the government.
Notwithstanding all this, the genilcmam
1 from Virginia is wonderfully afraid of ufiog
j language which might irritate France : Mr.
0 S. wi(hed France had nÂ»t given just cause of
a irritation, but thnfe who had read the cor
refpondenoe which had been laid before them,
0 for a few years pad, mull have seen reitera
'Â» ted insults to this country.
It was fufncicnt io call to their recolltc
j_ tion the many indelicate ar.d offenfive expref
;r (ions used by the various French Ministers.in
re their diplomatic letters. Ir.deed, were he
Â» inclined to aggravate the sggMfions we had
,n received, he might difp'ay a whole volume
of Genet's abuse. He IhouU, however, fa
tisfy himfclf by presenting some elegant ex-
0 _ trads from the letters of Citizen Adet. Mr.
ar S. here quoted a nuipber of offenfive epi

â¢Mr. S. frfid, as he knew in.Jecent ar.d liarfh u
langu-.ge always recoilrd upon thof- wlia d
used it, lie did not tvifh to a 'opt it ; but at
the time it was due to uurlelves to ex- t
press our feelings with a proper decree of ri
ltrength and spirit. He was nut in the habit n
of quoting any thing from Mr. Gener, bu: o
there was one exprtHlon of his which he a
thaught contained good adviL-e, " all this Â«
accommodation and humility, all this conde
scension attair,3 no end." 1
After the gentleman from Virginia had ti
dwelt fufficiently upon the danger of irrita- c;
ling the French, he had emphatically called 01
upon us to recolledt our tueaknefs. It might b;
have been as well if he had left that to have Â»!
been discovered from another quarter. He bi
hoped we had fufficient confidence in the U
meant of defence which we pofTcffed, if dri- w
ven to the last resort; and he believed that if 1
there was any one more certain way of K
provoking War than another, ix was that of a
proclaiming our own tueaknefs
He hoped such a language would now be Â°l
spoken as would make known to the French w
government, that the government and people P 1
of this country were one,and that they wouldi e '
repel any attempt to gain an influence over a<
our councils and government. The gentle c<
man had said that thetÂ« did net appr-r to !>e hi
any design of this kind, and had endeavored
to do away what was stated as the opiuion in â
France, in General Pinckney's letter. He o
did not mean to red this altogether upon the 1
repoits of an emigrant, whom General Pinck-
ney mentions as having represented this coun
try divided, and of no greater consequence Â«
than Genoa or Geneva, but he took the whole
information into view. [He read the ex- b ,
traft relative to this subject 3 fii
It was evident, Mr. S. said, from this in- 111
formation from Franee, that an opinion had
been taduitrioufly circulated there that the (]
government and people of this countiy were vi
divided ; that the Executive was corrupt and
did not pursue the interctts of the people ; J
and that they might, by perseverance, over- C
turn the administration, and introduce a new j a
trder of things. Was not such an opinion as |
this, he a/ked, calculated to induce France r j
to believe that she might make her own terms . n
with us ? It was well known what the French |
wished, and it was time to declare it plainly; jj
his opinion was that (he designed to ruin the tt
commerce cf Great-Britain through us ti
This was evident. They talked of the British w
treaty ; but they fiiftered it to lie dormant ' 0
for near twelvfc months, without complaining ol
about it. Why were they silent till within a
a few weeks befoie the ele&ien of our Prefi- yi
dent i Why did they commit spoliations up- q
on our commerce long befote the Britilh *
tieaty was ever dreamt of ? Their firft de- 1 P
cree, dircfting spoliations of our property, c j
and the capture of our provision Clips, was on j fl
the 9th of May, 1793, a month before the Â°
provifioa order of Great-Britain, which was f'
dated June 8, 1793 : and why have they w
from that time to this, been committing fpo- p
liations on our commerce ? The Bntiih trea- t<
ty was publilhed in Paris in Attguft, 1795 ; v !
a year after, in July, 1796, they deteimine t |
to treat us in the fame way that we fuffer ' g
other nations to treat us, and this decree was j
not made known to our government till the j n
O&eber following, a few weeks before the : J
eleftion of President.
But this wasnot all; the l'Verch had pur
sued similar measures towards all the other i|
neutral powers. Sweden, in confiquence, si
had no minillerin their country, and was on 1
the eve of a rupture. The intention of the J
French evidently was, to compel all the neu
tral powers to deflrrty the commerce of Great f
Britain ; but. he trusted this country had c
mure spirit than to fuffer herfelf to be thus b
forced to give up her commerce with Gteat t
Britain ; he truiled they would spurn any c
such idea. 1
Mr. S. hojjed the obfervatioas which he '
had made would not be construed iuto a wish ,
to fee the United States and France involved j
- in a war. He had no objeAisn to such mea- 1
fures being taken for preferviog peace betwixt 1
the two countries as should be confident with 1
national honor. It was a delicate tiling for '
them to fuggefl what the Executive ought
to do. It was out of their province to di
reÂ£t him. The Execuiive had various con
siderations to take into view. We had in- '
juries to complain of againlt France for the
I spoliations committed upon our commerce.
If the Executive conceive we have a right to
redress, that fu'ojeft will of course eonftitute
â¢ a part of our envoy's inftru&ions. Would it
' then be proper, said he, for this House to
1 interfere with the Executive, to obtrude its
> opinion and fay, " You mull give up this
1 point; we take upon us (without any au
s thority by the conllituticn) to give Carte
t Blanche to Jrancff, without, any indemnihea
i tion or redress."
1 The gentleman fays it is the ohjeft of the
s amendment on the table, to recommend to
e ihe Executive to remove any inequalities in
â  the treaties ; that was alone fufficieiit to vote
I) it out.
t There had been no period since the revo
â  â¢ lu'ion which had so powerfully called on
n Americans for that fortitude and wisdom
g which they knew so well how to display on
r. great axd folenan emergencies It was not
>f his intention to offend any one by Hating the
r- queflion in such strong terms: but he was
l, persuaded that when the present fi'uation ot
Â»- our affaits with refpeft to France was well
undrrltood, it would be found that to ac
:â¢ quiefce in her present demands was virtually
f- and efTentially to surrender our felf govern
in ment and independence. |
le The independence of a nation, lie olferved,
id might be defhoyed in various modes. Whe
le tlier a preponderating influence was obtained
a- in her councils by fedudiou, intrigue or ter
x- ror, or by a dired and open invsGon of her
r. territories, and consequent subjugation, was
>i- immatetial: IndeeJ it wauli tc fifcr fcr v s
' if a foreign power were at once to attempt
our (ul.juration y inviifion j for, in that
cafe, there could be but one opinion amoiig
Americans about a vigorous refiltance ; but
the flaw approaches to our fubjedtion, by the
subtle artifices of intrigueand deception, were
fehiom difcetned by the community at large,
until their peftileritial effrfls had taken such 1
deeps root at to In: with difficulty extirpated.
Was it faying too much, to assert that dif*.
ting to out government, fomenting an itiftir
reclion in our bosom, influeueirg the moil
important election, demanding a violation of
our engagements, the tepeal of out laws, the
annulling the decrees of our courts of juflice,
were not merely interferences with our go
vernment, but in fadt attempts to usurp it i
The complaints of France refpe&ing the Bri
tilh treaty were the pretext, but not the real
cause of her aggressions. It was idle to wink
out of fight the real causes : flie wished (as he
had before ftatfJ) to dellroy tlic commerce
Â»f England, and the United States were to
be the initrument in accomplishing it. The
United States were to be coerced into such
measures as would effcft this great fchcrae.
The fame policy wis pursued towards the
Hanfe Towns and Denmark : had they made
a Britilh 11 eat y ? Were they anf wet able for I
the fins of ours i The review he had taken
of the ground of controversy as to our treaty '
with England mull have rfmoveJ every im- P
predion unfavourable to our government, and 1
evinced the unceasing efforts of France to v
acquire an improper ascendancy over our
councils, and direst them to the purposes of
her own aggrandizement.
Whether or no our government ought, on prin- a
ciplea of amity and conciliation, to 'quilirr our a
treaties between England and France, was a qucftion
of an executive nature, and was not properly before
the hcufr. An offej of such equalization would n - a
doubtcdly depend on the disposition of France to
make proper and Tunable rquivalents. tl
The gentleman from Virginia had cautioned the
committee against alarming the pride of Fianceâ .
but, exclaimed Mr. S has Ameiica no pride ?it l '
hei fcnftbi.ity so debated by prejudice or benumbed \
by terror ai to be thrown out of view on this occa
lion ? 1 trust not, I trust that American pride ftili
maintains an important influence ovet our delibera
tions, and desirous as lam to fee it yield all that is a
due to the influence of policy, God forbid that it I
should ever be lupplanted by an interested and ftr- H
vile tamenefs. He thought it became thedignity of
the House to fupportthe Executive in firm and man- Â®
ly language. He was-perfuaded that a decided con- is
dudt would be the moftlikely to discourage aggref- ]i
Con and repetition of insult. He recommended not j
a menacing but a firm countenance; not a bullying, ..
but an undaunted attitude. This wou'.d convince â¢]
the world we were not to be threatened out of our ti
rights; whereas a timid supplicating pollute could
not fail to invite frclh insults and humiliation. ,
Mr - S. said, he valued unanmity as much at other
gentlemen. He Was fenUblc ;hat it would be pecu- tl
Itarly important at this juncture. It woÂ«ld engage n
the confidence of the people and fortify the negocia- n
Uon. It would convince the world, that however
we might differ upon fpeculetive points of admi- a
mArauon, there was but one sentiment, resetting p
our felf government. It would extingulfh the hopes a
of those who attempted to keep alive a faction in the r
country ; it would crulh the expectations of those
who wished to fubllitute a foreign influence to the "
constituted authorities of the nation. But it might (
(till be purchased by too dear a facrifice; and he j
would rather have only a bare majority for the re
port Â»f the committee, than an unanimous vote for
the amendment; so much did he reprobate its prin
ciples. He thought it of more importance that there a
should be an unanimitybetweeuall the departments ,
of the government, than an unanimity in the house,
at the expeace of its separating from the other {
branches of the government; but if the amendment c
was agreed to, it mull produce a separation from the
Prcfident and Senate, and confirm the opinion lof
teiedin Franeeofa division exifticig between the go
vernment and people. Much, therefore, as he t
cnciifhed unanimity the could not purchase it on (
this occasion by agreeing to a propelition, of so dan
gerous a tendency.
Mr. Smith concluded with requesting the com
mittee feriottfly to ponder on the coafequence of
ag.eeittg to the amendment. It spoke the fame <
feeble language as the address of the last feflion, ;
. the fame timid relu&ance to express our sense of ,
'injury, the fame reliance on negeciation alone ; j
if this was all tha: the gentlemen on the other
fide prepofed doing at this extraordinary feflion, '
! the calling of Congress would prove the "molt
humiliating, the most calamitous measure that
had ever been adopted. Bstter indeed had the
members remained at their homes, and there in
secret silence mourned over thedifbonor of their
country, and smothered their resentments, than
be collected in mafj from all parts of the union,
to be thus publicly exhibited as fellow witnefles
of their own lhame and the Indignities offered
their country without the power or even the cou
rage to resent them. But he could not believe
it polTible that the committe should pursue a
course so pregnant with humiliation, and he con
fidently . peÂ»ftuded himfelf that as his country
had always djfplayed its juflice, so would all
parts of the house unite on this occasion to con
vince the woild that her fortitude and firmnefs
were eq'ial to her justice.

man who came in this veflel. lias favored us
with a rrgtriar file of 7'he PuJ! Boy of the
Armies, and General Bulletinâa Paris paper,
as late as the 301(1 of March. From these
papors we give tranflitions of several impor
tant articlesâThey follow.
Capt. Manwa; ring fays all apprehensions
of a war between Franc# and America had
subsided some time before he failed. This
change of opinion was supposed to be in con
fequtnee of news from America of Mr. Jef
ferfon's being appointed extra; Ambaffadof
to that Republic.
The Tiosijltitims.
VIENNA, March n.
It appears now decided, that his Royal
Highness tlie Archduke Charles, is to pre
fcrve the chief command of the army of the
Rhine ; but as this prince is to command in
petfon, the army of Italy; I.is orders will be
transmitted to field marlhal Citron Mack,â
who will communicate them to the army.
A corps of 1500 cavalry, part of which
have alieady pafied this city front Moravia &
Bohemia, on their way to the atmy as Italy ;
and the remainder of the Vienna volunteers
are to pracced to day for the fame army.â
When all the reinfoieementsdeftined for that
army arrive, it will amount to 120,000 men.
We are now employed in the exchange of
the garrison of Mantua, and to this cffedl, a
great number of French prifaners, aie on
their march from Austria to France. The
Vienna volunteers are alrtady exchanged.
Mayenct, March 15.
Several of the mod fupcrior oSeers of the
army of the Rhine, are about to depart for
Italy : Their loss would be fevrrely felt, â
were it not, great confidence is placed on the
abilities of gen. Mack. We learn this gen.
is to have a conference with Latour,
Kray and Wernetk, before they let out for
Italy ; and that he wiH immediately after in
fpe6t the whole line of the Imperial troops,
to Huningcn.
All officers.and others, belonging to the
Autlrian army, have received orders to be at
their refpedive porta by the 16th of this
month at fartheft. It is thought, gen. Mack
means to a& offenfively sn the Upper Rhine,
and that he will make the grcatell efforts to
penetrate to the new couatries, where they
are in hopes of being effectually affi(le<l.â
By this operation, the French army will find
it impoiliblc to attempt any thing against
Germany.
ExtraH of a letter from Manheim dated 15/ i
March.
A eonfiderable number of troops are jufl
arrived here from the environs of Kempton,
in Eallern Suabia ; it is thought they are to
penetrate through the Milanese by a new
contrivance.
Prague, March 9.
Several detachments set out lafl week for
the army of the Rhine ; they-will be imme
diately followed by a new division of cavalry.
Paris, March 26.
We read inTeveral public papers, that gen.
Buonaparte has obtained a signal victory
over the Archduke Charles, 10,000 Auftii
ans were killed and takes on the field of bat
tle. This news has been received from Kel
lerman, who learnt it by a courier from Bu
onaparte. Not wiftitng to doubt the au
thenticity of this news, we only remark that
it is furprifiag the Dire&ory has net receiv.
Ed any intelligence refpefting it. The offi
cial journals make uo mention of this impor
tant viftory.
We are assured that a conference for peace
has taken place at Turin, between fÂ»en. Clark
and the margin's de Lucr hefini. The friends
of humanity mud wifti fucccfs to this uego
ciation.
March 27.
The news of the vist >ty obtained by the
French army in Italy ovet the Archduke
Charles, has not yet been received by the
Direftory, is we mentioned in our last, but
by the Venetian Ambassador at Paris. The
Dirc&ory anxiously wail for offi- ial details.
March 28. â¢
In a letter from Gen. Buonaparte, dated
March 17, head quarters at Valdafone, he
mentions having on the 16th of March, tak
en from the Aulliian army 6 pieces of can
non, 1 genera], fevcral sffieers, and from 4 to
JOÂ© men. Adjutant-general Kellermari had
received several strokes of the sword, in char
gingat the head of the cavalry, with his ulu
al courage.
March 29-
Thomas Paine left this city the 1 (I inllant,
on his return to America. His departure
will be no great loss to France, alt ho* several
enthusiasts fay, they admire his writing, tho'
â¢ they do not underlland it. His last pitbli.

that it was not democratic enough.
