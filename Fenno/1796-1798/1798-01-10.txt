In confeqocncÂ« of tiÂ»'e refolutio 1 we hkd come 10, fe
to meet on the days of the arrival of the post from t j.
our conferences fhii last week h-ve taken
place regularly every other morping, except on
'/burfday, the 10th of Auguil* which being the an- I
"tiivexfary of one of the national feftivals, the Frer.ch
legation could not attend. p,
I have in mine, hTo. 17 given your lordfhio an r
arcount of eveTV thing which paflV.d up Io that of the
6h. On ike Bth nothing was said at all worth tranf- C
milting, except an intimation flung out by one of the ct
French plenipotentiaries, that it would be neceffarv
to take into consideration the rights of neutral na- c
tions on thitoccafion. Bat as hefpoke very vaguely, an
and in general tertni, I did uot choose to prels him tb
for an explanation, ai I confiier itmore judietous tn a
avoid difcuillonKoii feparateand collateral points, and
rrot to enter into negotiation 'till the whole can be
bmucht underdeliberat on at once. Ob
What passed on the 1 ath was rather more interest- VQ
injr. The return of Mr. Weflky afforded me a very *
natural opportunity of exprelfing the impa - icnce With
whicKan answer to dy lall noÂ£e waj exptfted by my cd
\ conn ; that three weeks had now elapied since its tic
ed tr infipujte that due atÂ«enti'm had not teen paid to
so very im ortaot a fubjeft as that on which we were 10
treating, yÂ« I could not bu-' greatly lament, that day CO
sftcr day should be. allowed to away without cur y Q
proceeding at all in
were met. Ooe of the French minitters said, that it
was irapoflible I could lament this delay more than
ihey did 1 that they had already declared to me that
it was oceaQoned by a wt(h not to create but to re-
move difficulties; and they could aflute me poGtivtjly,
that the French government had no other objeÂ£l in
vjew, andahat I Ihould find, when once we brgan tH(
fairlyto nÂ«gociate, wÂ«Â» thould proceed very rapidly wr
I rep'ieo, it was indeed very material U> make w j
jjood the time we loft The French minister an- -
iwered, you ,would not call it time loft if you knew * Ol
how it was employed. On my expressing, by my
manner, a wilh to be informed, he went on, by fay- c il
ing, we will not scruple fell you, though we feel
vt ought not yet to do it offictallv, that we are con
futing with our allies ; that we have communicated tCi
to them all that has paded here ; we have dated that, a t
unlets they mean to continue the war, they must re- fe(
lease us from our engagements, and enable us, in a -
certain degree, to meet your prop jfals.
The conference of to-day is this moment over. One M
of the Fiench plenipotentiaries informed me, that he A
had leceived this morning a letter from the Prefideut
of the Directory, alluring him that in four or live
days they would receive their final inductions ; and no
be added of himfelf, that he truAcd these would be OC
such as would enabU us to continue ouf work with
<â  out any further interruption I said, I hoped these
inftrudicns would be in a counter-p'ojct, as
J did not fee bow any thing lbort of one would eaa
ble us to proceed so rapidly as he defenbed. He a- th
greed with me er.ttrely, and a flu red me, that both re j
he and his colleagues had repca'edly stated the necef
(jty of a being sent them ; and heob- ni '
served, that he really thought the French government CO
have forefeen fvery thing which had paflcd,
and beeo prepared with ont ; anH that this work Â»
vould have laved a great deal of valuable time. As I
could not myfelf have said more, 1 readily gave a full *Ol

An ' Jtprrffton mtnlioncd in one of your lordfhip'i CO
lift HiffJicbeJ to hÂ«vc f.llrn from one of the French
plcnipotentMiit!, leads to Ihe prcfumption that it is ,â¢
ifitendcd, on the part of France, to bring forward
iotne p'opofal about the *sviga(mn of neti ral powers
in time of war. Your lq,d(hip will bed judge of the w]
proper opportunity of exprelTirtg his majelly's decid- an
ed and uoalterakie icfolution on thiÂ« point, not to ad- Â«
mit ef any pfopofals of treatnig with hit enemiea on n '

convey, an accufaiion against hismajefty'B govern-
ment that foine delay has ar fen on the part ef an
this c< nntry in the negotiations at Lisle. This is
so avowedly contrary to the fa A, that it mufl be w j
confidcred w impoffiMc that such a charge couldbe â¢
intended to be made by a government which<afc
had at that moment delayed for thr:c weeks m%
ing any aifwer to hit majelly's diftinfl and liberal M

were daily apnlijirxg to your lordship for thisun

I cuJaiioti of >W'*y was mean c to apply tÂ® die man-

V tiaiiou at Lisle; atirfif it v.ls so meant, tod'clare
' that no accnfÂ»tion was ever more deltitnte ot fonn
" dation, nor j wider devi ition frcm the real fail.
~ I Cud' I wjtl perfe2ly reaJy to abide by their de
termiuarioti on this point, coavinced that it was
imputable (<sr tliem nat to acknowledge that the
y delay (if there had been any blameable delay) reS
ed wirl the French government, slid not with his
majesty The Freneii plenipotentiaries admitted
thu to be raoll ftriflly true ; that the phrsfe I hid
It quoted was an ill-judged one, an.! mal-rcJigcc:
y but that it could not in any fojnt of A'lew whatev-
J cr be cQiittrued as applying to England, and they
were reÂ»dy to fay. that when it was written, the
i directory alluded to the court of Vienna ; that they
0 could alfure me they had been tcry faithful ill their
1 reports, Â»ad that when they said thii, it wis fay
? ing in other words that 1 hid carried on the nego
tiation with as much expedition as poflible, and
" t that if it had proceeded slowly fortius last month,
the flownef* arose on their fid'.-, aud not on mine.
t I said I could not for an iuftant call in
question their feelings on this point: it was
' the infinuatian conveyed in the message, and
which had gone over Europe, that it was ne
cessary for me to clear and to know whe
ther the direftory thought and felt as they
did. One of the French ministers, with
very flrong expressions, assured me the direc
tory certainly did think and feel like them ;
that no unfair or insidious allusion was meant
and added, " Que ce message etoit fait pour
ftimuler les Coumcils." I went on by ob
serving it was very essential for me to have
this fully explained, and that-1 (hould give
them in a note to this effeft : they requelted
I would not; it would lead to disagreeable
difcufttons, and would not answer the end I
proposed. They would take upon them
selves now to aflfure me in the name of the
Direftory, that nothing at all similar to the
eonftru&ion I put on the phrafc was intend
ed, and that as soon as they could receive
an answer to the report they iholild make of
the day's conversation, they Vrould fay the
fame from the direftary itfelF.
I hope, my lord, I have, therefore, by
obtaining this very precise and formal- disa
vowal of an intention to fix any imputation
of delay qn his majesty's government, fulfill
ed the objÂ«<ft of my inftruftions on this par
ticular point. If when the French plenipo
tentiaries speak from the directory the disa
vowal (hould not be equally fatisfa&ory and
complete, I then will'not fail, according to
your lordship's order, to'give in a note. I
have the honour to be, fcc.
No. 33. Ext raft of a dispatch from lord

August f J797.
The four conferences I have held with
the French plenipotentiÂ»nVÂ«. f'.c T
wrote to your lordship, on the 14th initant,
will I fear, furnifh very interest ing materials
for a dispatch. <
Oor conference of thia morrring was prin
cipally employed in what I have related in
my other dispatch ; but the French plenipo
tentiaries afTured me, that by Thursday, or
atthelateftby Saturday, they expefted to
receive their long expefted meflenger.

I am efctremeiy sorry te be forced to an
nounce to yonr lordship, that frefh delays 1
occur in the progress of the negociation..
The French plenipotentiaries informed me 1
at our conference yelterday, that thÂ« last an
swer from Holland was so unfatisfaftory that
the direftory had ordered the minister for fo
reign affairs to return it to the Dutch mi
nisters at Paris ; that the Dutch ministers
could not take upon themselves to alter it in
the way the Direftory proposed, but had â 
been obliged to refer to their government
for new orders ; and that therefore, suppos
ing no time to be loft in deliberation on this
fubjeft at the Hague, it would be at lead a
week from to day before any further account
could be received here.
After lamenting this unexpefted procras
tination of our business, I expressed a wish
to know what the Dutch answer had been,
what objeftions the direftory had made to it,
and what alteration they were desirOus it
(hould undergo.
One of the French plenipotentiaries said,
it had not been communicated to them, but
that he u.idtrftood it was complexe, I ache, et
peu fatisfaifante. âThat thedireftory expeft
ed it should be clear an(J diftinft, and such
an one as would enable them to fend such in
ftruftions here, as would allow us to'go on
with the negociation in a way to recover the
time we had loft.
No. 35. Extraft of a dispatch frsm lord
Malmefbury to lord Grenville, dated Lisle,
sth Sept. 1797.
I (hould have confideted what has passed
in our conference fincc I last had the honour
of writing to your lordship by Mr Wefley,
as in itfelf too unimportant to authorize me
to dispatch a meflenger, but that in general
I think it my duty never to leave your lord
ship more than a week without hearing
from me ; and I was also glad of ai\ oppor
tunity to acknowledge the receipt of your
lordship's idifpatch, No 23, which was de
livered to me by meflenger Shaw, on the 31ft
â¢f August at 10 P.M.
Nothing but common conversation passed
in our conferences of the 30th of Auglift,
and of the ill September. In that of the
3d the French plenipotentiaries confirmed
what they had taken upon themselves to af
furem* oft the 22d of August, inconfcquence
of the reprefciitation I had of your lord (hip's
oAleri to make on the expreflion9 employed
by the direftory in their message of 9th of
August, to the councils, and whieh expref-
CÂ»i>s appeared to fix an imputation ps delay
on hit aiajePt; *s govertSmCut in the progreii
of the negociation. They said that they had
reported to the directory wh.it I observed on
this fubjeft, and tlilt they were now charg
ed to repeat what I had aire3dy heard from
ihem, and to doclas'e -that no intention l'tnii
lar to that I nrpperfrd ever exiftrd on the
part of the directory.
In our coafeTehce of this morning, al
though I had reasOn to expect that the an
fwtr from the Hague was arrived at Paris,
yet it was not admitted by the French ple
nipotentiaries.
No. $6. Evtraft of a dispatch from lord
Malmefbury to lord Grenville, dated Lisle,
9th Sept. 1797.
I need riot fav that the* two conferences
wliichhave been held tince I dispatched the
meflcnger (Brooks) were not likely, under
the present circuintiances of this country, to
affird anything extremely important or in
tending.
In that of Thursday the 7th, one of the
French plenipotentiaries began, on my en
tering the room, by announcing a wi.fh that
the great event which had taken place at
Paris should not interrupt for a long rime
our negociation, or destroy the pleasing prof
pedt we had of its soon terminating fuccefs
fully ; and from his manner I clearly saw he
meant to convey the idea that it was, his o
pinion it would cot. lendeavoured to dif
coveV whether he spoke in Coafequeace of a
ny private intelligence he had received from
Pari#, or simply from his own private judg
ment ; and I found it was entirely from the
latter.
In our conference of this morning, he said
they were still without any letters from M.
Talleyrand (which rather surprised him) â¢
but he could assure me with certainty, that
by Monday they should be empowered to
go on with the negociation, and that I might
fafely fay so to my court.

Malmefbury, to lord Grenville, dated Lisle
Monday, Sept. 11, 1797.
My Lord,
On my going to the conference this morn
ing, the French plenipotentiaries, informed
me that the whole Ffertch legation was >e
called, and that Messrs. Treilhard and Bon
nier. d'Alco were appointed in their room.
They said, their ordmf were to communi
cate this event to me'itnttiediatefy, and at
the fame time to add; in the name of the.
French government, that this alteration in
the choice of the negociators, would not
proiuceany change whatever in the difp&fiti
on ef the directory, to bri'Og the negociati
on to a happy issue.
I assured them I was extremely sorry to
hear that they were re-called. That we had
hitherto adted together so cordially, that it
was to be lamented ahy circumftanees nad
arisen which made the French government
think it anvtfablc to put the negociation in
other hands.
That I received wfth fatisfadlion what
jthey told me â¢Â»Â» t u featiments of the di
rectory, relative to tbtj â¢ negociation, atl j
that I could assure them they were such as
certainly existed in the breast 6f my royal
master.
I then fvggefted to them, whether it
would not be proper to giv% me an official
note on this occasion, since it made a very
marked period in the negociation j and as
thyy perfedtly agreed with me on the pro
priety of this, they sent me that I now en.
close.
I consider this event as so material, that
I do not lose a moment ia dispatching one
of my servants to England, as I have at pre
sent no messenger with-tae. I have the ho
nour to be, &c. ...'â¢â *â¢
No. 39. Note from the French plenipo

17th Sept.l 797.
My LÂ° r d,
fSjThe new French plenipotentivies, Messrs.
Trtilhcrd and Bonnier d'Alco, with their '
principal fccietary, M. Depute* anâ¬ two
private fccretaries, arrivedhere at fivea'clock
A. M. on Wednesday the inft : at e
leveil A. M. they sent M. Derche to ac
ijnaint me with their arrival, and to enquire
4t what hour I would receive their visit ? In
consequence of my faying whenever it was
convenient to them, they came immediate
ly, attended by Messrs. Le Tournenr, Ma
rct, and Colcheri.
On taking"have, M. Le'Tourneur came
forward 1 said to roe, in his name and
that of his colleagues, that they could not
terminate their inijfion without expressing
the fatisfadlion they had felt from the open
ness and candor (Loyaute et Franchise)
With which I had afled durintMhe whole of
the negociation, or take leave of rr.e, with
out expressing their fincereperfonal regret;
that the recolledlicÂ® of my condudi would
always be agreeable to them, and that it had
given me the flrongeft title to their esteem
and good wiflies.
After giving the new plenipotentiaries as
much time as was necaffary to return to
their own house, I sent Mr. Rose to ask at
what hour I might return their visit ? and,
in consequence of their, answer, I went to
them, attended by lord Morpeth and Mr,
Ellis.
I took an opportunity of returning the
compjinjents,M. Le Tourneurhad made me;
a[id I must in j till ice repeat, my lord, what
I have already said, that his conduct and
that of his colleagues has, in every point
which has depended on them, been perfect
ly fair and honorable, and in no instance
contrary to the principles they announced,
and the profeflions they made. It is there
fore impoflible for me not to regret them,
and not to consider the change of negocia
tors at least as a very unpleasant, if riot a
very Unfortunate incident.

My Lord,
I shall endeavor in this dispatch to give

duedlory for Deace. He observed, that if
this desire hid manifefted itfelf so ftrengly
at a moment when the two great authorities
of the country were at variance, it must
naturally become stranger and be exerted
with more effedt when all spirit of division
wag suppressed, and when the government
was flresgthened by the perfedt concord
which now reigns between all its branches :
that the firft aud 010 ft material point to be
ascertained in every negociation was the ex
teut of the fnlf powers with which the, ne
gociators are vetted : that Ifhould find theirs
to be very ample ; and that, -as it was ne
cefiaryto the
iirfne fliould be equally so, they had it in
command to present a note, the obje*ft of
which was to inquire, whether I was au
thorised to trea* on the principle of a gen
eral restitution of .every poffeflion remaining
in his majesty's basds, not only belonging
to them, but to then* allies ; that I was not
I unacquainted with their laws and with their
treaties ; that a great tountry could not on
any occasion aft in contradiction to them ;
and that, aware as I muftbe df this, I could
not but expeA the queftioii contained in the
note, neither could I consider the reguifi
tion of an explicit atifwer, previous to en
tering upon the negociation, asarifingfrom
any other motive than that of themoft er
-1 feft wish, onthe part of the dire&ory, lo
bring it to a fuccefsful, and, above nil, to
a fpeedyCQiiclufion. .
I replied, that if after what I heard I
could allow myfelf to hope for such an e
vent as he seemed to think or give
any credit to the pacific diipofitions he
announced on the part of the French Gov
ernment, fiich hope must arise solely from
the confidence I might place in his alluran
ces, fincib the measure itfelf now adopted
by the Dire&ory was certainly calculated
to make a diredtlv contrary irr.preflion on
my mind : that I could not conceal from
him, that far from expecting such a questi
on, its being now put surprized me l.;yond
meafnrc, aad still more so, when from his
comment upon it I v.as to infer, that he
withed me to consider it as tending to pro
mote a speedy pacification ; that the ques
tion expressed in the note he had delivered
(for he had given it to me, and I had read
it over as he ended his speech) was word for
word the fame as that put to me by his pre
decessors so long ago as the 14th of July ;
that on the 15th I had, from my own au
thority, given an answer, and that this an
swer I confirmed fully and diftin&i'y by or
der ,<?f my court 011 the 24th July ; that
these notes had to the present hour remain
ed unnoticed, and a delay of two montlis
had occurred ; that the re'afons afligned for
this delay were, as I was repeatedly told, a
decided refolntion on the part of the French
government to listen to the reasonable pro- |
pofals made by his majefly , but that bein;;
bound by their engagements with the court
of Madri(J*ind the Batavian republic, and
i\ifhing to treat their allies with due consi
deration, they were desirous of confuhing
with them previous to any positive declara
tion, and obiaining from them a voluntary
rtleafe from those engagements,
to enable the French plenipotentiaries here
to admit the balls Jiis majesty had eftablifh
cd, and to groundon it all future discussions
which might arise in the ceurfe of the ne
gociation ; that if he had read over the pa
pers left, undoubtedly in his poffeflion by
Mi predecessors, he would find what I ftate'j
to be ftridlly true ; and that of course it
coft'.d not be difficult to accountlfor my sur
prize, when, after being told that he and
i ilia colleague were to take up tlie iiegocia
tion prccifely where they found :'t, now be
came) evident that it was to be Hung bsck
to the very point from which we lfarted,
and flung back in-a j*ay which ftemed to
threaten a conclusion very different from
that he foretold

â¢wasonly by a treaty, that difference! could "J,
be compramifed, and as oac of our greatefi
complaints against Great-Britain had eonrtantly r
been that Ihs refufed to make a commercial t'rea- c
ty with us, and as future injuries to our iom- k
merce would be moA finely prevented hv a rrea- j f
ly of commerce, it" followed of course that a | 0
commercial treaty on good terms would be very j
acceptable to as, if it could be obtained from
that nation. How tlrange then mull it appear,
that Mr. Monroe did not rightly represent Mr.
Jay's miflion, and tnÂ»t he Ihould never have us- a
ed the words pr the fubflance of the words of J
the Secretary of State, though he purposely met e
the committee to address therA on this fubjefl. ,
What palled between him and the committee
deserves particular notice. .
In his letter dated the id of December 'i 794,
to Secretary Randolph, he mentions that he had '
fought and obtained an interview with the diplo
matic members of the cornmittee for the pur- 1
pose of removing unfavourable suspicions which ,
wer* entertained concerning the million to Lon - |
Jon. What parted at this rneetiag relative to
this >jeA, is Hated by him in the following
words: 41 By another I was alked whether Mr.
Jay was still in London, and whether he ill
tended to come over to Paris, as had been pub ]
lilhed in an Erglifll paper. This was the fuf- 1
picion I wifh?d t9 eemhat and remove, though , |
indeed I did not expeil it weald have been a- (
vowed i*i ft abrupt a manner ; I replied I could â 
not tell vihetbtr he bad returned or ntt ; but
that it was in the Eng- â¢'
ii!h paper fhouid be true, as he was sent to Eng-
Unt*. upon an especial business only, to demand 1
reparation far injuries, aiidjo which his autho
rity was -DriiSfiy limiWJ"â(page 90). Ittf his
pamphlet lae informs the public, that he replied
" the report could not be true, finre Mr. Jay
vas sent to England upon fpefitl bufiuefe only,
tÂ» demand compensation for the depredations
ft* eUr trade, and the far render of the luejlern
pofis, to which his authority was ftritflly limit
ed." The variance between the two statements
Hay not be deemed material ; but if it be, and
if the latter was the purport of Mr. Monroe's
icprefentation, as Mr. Pucviance certifies, it fol
lows that our minister has been guilty of two
tiifreprefentatiojis: rft, a misrepresentation to
the committee of the powers of Mi . Jay being
ftri<3ly limited to spoliations and the polts ;
and idly, a misrepresentation to the executive of
the misrepresentation he made to the committee.
Jt is tru?, that Mr. Monroe admits in his pub
lication, that thÂ« nature and object of Mr. Jay's
jwiffion to England had been inifrepreliyited
through him to the French government â(p 29 J
I aik whole fault was this ? Had be adverted to
the words of Secretary Randolph, and conform
ed to them or to their meaning, he would not
have b;an guilty of misrepresenting to the com
mittee, that Air, Jay's powers were limited fo'.e
ly and cxclufjvely to spoliations on aur com
merce and the detention of our ports. All that
Sueretaiy Randolph said to minister Monroe
was, that Mr. Jay was reftraioed from contra
vening any former treaties with other nations,
and the motives of the million were ts obtain
enmpenfation for spoliations and a furrendcr of
the ports. If the minister had thus represented
the million, he would have been eorredl; but he
inflitutes another language, and very different
ideas. He fays " Mr. Jay was sent to England
upon an especial business only, to demand repa
ration for injuries, and tÂ» <which hit authority
â¢waj ftriltly limited." Having thus misrepre
sented this matter to the committee, he most
audaciously undertakes to east the blame of it
on the Executive of the United States ; as if the
executive could supply him with i intelligence of
mind Or refllhi'l, in rate
were wanting. The words of Srcrefary Ran
dolph were-plam, open and artless.
One'would expef! that Mr. Monroe would
'have gone tÂ» the conference which the commit
tee granted to him, well prepared upon the t..pic
which he intended to introduce, and that his in
ftrudlions on that were thoroughly uaderftood.
Yet the reverse appears to have been the cafe,
and it was on this occasion that the misrepre
sentation was made. It may be asked, what
Ihould he have said ? I answer, he ftoutd have
used the words of Secretary Randolph ; he
Blight have ad.ied, that his country, the United
States of America, having received many inju
ries from Great-Britain, had sent aÂ« envoy to
demand fktisfaDion and to prevent complaints,
by placing the intrrtourfe between the two na
tions upon the liablejjrincip'es of justice and be
nevolence, and that it was the earntfl desire of
America to live in peace and harmony with all
the nationi of the earth. Moll efepacially, he
Ihould not have l'o miftaled the iniffien, as to lay
a certain foundation for the futi:re difappoint
mcnt and difctmtents of the French republic, in
cafe it succeeded. SCIP'IQ.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
TUESDAY JANUARY 9.
Mr. Livingfton, from the Committee of
Commerce and Manufa&ures, to whom was
committed the amendments of the Senate to
the bill for the relief of North and Vefey,
reported it, as the opinion of the commit
tee, that they ought to be agreed to, and
the report was concurred in.
Mr. D. Foftei, from thecornmittee of
Claims, reportad a bill directing the Secre
tary of War to place certain persons on the
pension lift, which was twice read and com
mitted for to-morrow.
Mr. Gal'atin presented a petition from
Patrick Cammony, and Mr. FintJley one
from George Meerhoufe, soldiers in the
late war, for compensation. Referred to
,the committee of Claims.
Mr. Dennis proposed the following resol
ution for the adoption of the House :
" Resolved that thÂ« committee of Ways
and Means be dire&ed to require whether
any, and if any, what alterations are neces
sary in the feverdl afts impofmg a duty on
Spirits distilled within the United States,
and on Hills so far as relates to the entry ot
Stills, and that they be authorized to re
port by bill or otherwise."âAgreed.
Mr. W. Claiborne called for the order of
tlje day on the report on the petition and
remonltrance of the LcgiflatureoPTennelTee
which being agreed to, the House resolved
into a committee of the whole on the
fubjeft, Mr. Dent in (he chair, and the re
port having been read, the following resolu
tion was under confederation :
" Resolved, that the sum of
dollars be appropriated for the relief
offuch citizens of the ita,te of Tennessee as
have rights to lands within the said Hate, by ,
virtue of the cefiion out of the state of North ;
Carolina, and have made a&ual settlements
thereon, and who have bsen the ;
poiTefliou of the said lands by the optrafion
of the a<s for reguJivng the intercourse witk at
the Indian tribes. The said sum to btf sub- tc
jest to the order ofthe of the Use
nited States, to be expended under his di- r.<
re&ton, either in extinguilhing the Indian in
claim to the above described lands, in cafe tl
he shall deem it expedient to hold a treaty o]
j for that pnrpofe, or tie disposed of in such te
| other manner as he shall deera best ealcula- n<
ted to afford the perfon3 herein defcriked a in
temporary relief." h
Mr. W. Claibortie moved to strike out fe
all the words of the refolntion after the word tl
for in the second line, and to insert " the in
extinftion of the Indian claim ' to all or any
part of the land within the limits of the state bi
ofTenneffee, in cafe the President ofthe w
United States shall think it expedient to hold T
a Treaty for that purpose." d(
Mr. Venable hoped this motion would pi
â  not be agreed to, and that the mover of rt la
would not persist in it, as it might hazard hi
the relief proposed to be given to the diftref- ra
ed citizens of Tennessee. He did not believe h:
the House would consent to appropriate so ri
. large a sum as would be necessary to accom- tc
plifh the objeft contemplated by his amend- tc
â  tnent. He was disposed to afford relief to ai
1 the persons whose cases had been presented al
| to thÂ« House, as he thought they had d
. hardly and unjustly used ; but he was not cl
. .disposed to go farther at present. ei
Mr. M'Do well seconded the motion, be- I;
1 cause, if it were necessary t<j hold a treaty tl
â¢ with t%e Indians at all, the expence might t;
J not probably be much increased, by extend- fl
ing it to other obje&s. He wished, there- h
( fqre, that the Commissioners employed to f(
â negociate a treaty, fhouid have it in their c
1 power, if they found their Indians disposed si
- to enter upon the business, to treat with res- ii
\ peÂ£t to other lands in which many citizens w
of Tennessee, of North and South Carolina, g
and other states, were deeply interested t
3 whose lands, which many of them had earn
-3 ed by their hard Services in the war, lay in r
I that Stjte, and the United States had step- f
; ped in, by the late treaty, and said they fl
fhouid not enjoy theTn. He was clear, from t
the articles of confederation, and from the r
laws of the United States, that thefepeo
j pie were entitled to Justice, a# well as those r
J who had been drive* by violence from the c
0 possession of their property. ii
Mr. Rutledge was of opinion that uncon- c
' neAed with the fituatien of the unhappy t
people who had been driven from their pof- o
. feflions, be thonght this motion perfeftly t
t proper. He formed this opinion from a re- f
e fcrence to thÂ© journals of the house. He I
- had been induced, from application* l made fl
'Â» to him by citizens holding land in that coun- e
try, to examine into this fubjed). In look- ii
ing over the afts of North-Carolina, in 1783 t
e he found that state opened a land office for n
t the redemption of certain daims for piilita- a
d ry and other services, by grants of hnd in f
'â¢ their territory south weft of the Ohio.â- t
Afterwards, when N. Carolina became One c
Â£ of the United States, she made a grant of c
lt this territory to the United States, vfpon c
e certain conditions, one of which was, that f
if the grant 3 already made fhouid not be alter- ]
r e 3 nr SmjimWil. and yet. by the treary of 1
'* Holflon, thÂ« United States had,'in violati- '1
on of this contrast,- guaranteed this land i
t _ to the Cherokee Indians. If this were not ]
c a correft flatement, he begged to be cor- t
i- reeled ; and if it were, it was a direst vi- i
I. olation of the treaty with North-Carolina, f
In private life, there would be a remedy at
law for such a departure from contrafl â } \
, e but in this cafe, there was no remedy, but c
e by appealing to the justice of the Legislature i
d of the Union. This appeal had been made I
i- and he hoped it would not be in vain. The i
0 people of Tennessee fay, either restore us to I
â¢' the situation in which we were, or return i
to us our money with interest. What had i
Jj- been the proceedicgs of Congress on this i
|| business ? The House of Representatives 1
ie had formerly agreed that the certificates of i
y the persons entitled to these lands fhouid be i
â¢' funded, and interest allowed uptjn them, and 1
IB that hereafter when a treaty Ihould be made i
with, the Indians, they might receive their
lands on re-paying their money. Another ;
House of Representatives came to a similar
J, resolution, but the Senate not conccurring,
the business fell to the ground. But the
gentleman from Virginia said this was an
jf improper time to go into the business,
ls He did not think so. If a treaty were to
o be held, he thought it ought to be extend-
r } ed to all the owners'of land in this situation,
as well as to that held by adlual settlers.
d The difference of expence to the United
States would be a mere bagatelle ; besides,
jf government would be repaid with usurious
interest by the sale of the land which would
, c be obtained by a general treaty ; whereas
a- if this were not the cafe, the expence of
treaty would be loft. And if this caurfe
m were not taken, the persons v.'ho had a pro
ie perty in this land would never fail to call u
ie pon CÂ°ngrefs until their complaints were
;o redressed.
Mr. Otis was not disposed to go into the
ii, merits of the claims which had been advo
cated by his fiiend from S. Carolina. He
n was one ps the committee who made the
;r report, and had no objection to its b<"ing
f- now agreed to, though he thought it would
>n be more advifeable to postpone the business
s, so. - a few days, as he was informed that the
jf Frefident of the United States had nomina
e - fed Commissioners for the holding of a trea
ty with the Indians for the
sf ofthe Indian claim to the lands in question,
id , which nomination was before the Senate,
;e I and would ptobably soon be agreed to ; and
d : when the house was acquainted Jwith the
ie powers given to these commissioners, they
j. i would know better how to adt in the bufi- j
j. ) ness. Besides he thought it improper to
I do any thing which fhouid appear like an
i interference with business that belonged to ;
rf the Executive Department. He thought,
as therefore, the original report ought to be
v agreed to, or that the comfliitte fhouid rife,
h and afic leave to fit again.
t3 Mr. Macon was glad to hear that thePre
ie fident had nominated commissioners for hold
in ! ing a treaty with the Indians on this fubjeft;
*
and he hoped the committee would proceed j
to appropriate money to enable him to ef- , n
feft the bulia-fs. This he said, would be n
no new thing, and it would he going hand t
in hand with the President, and enable him c
the faoner to carry his benevolent views into w
operation. Jn 1793, congress appropria- I n
tid a sum of money fur treating with the- ' t
north wellern Indians, before they had any ! g
intimation from the Preltdent on the fubjcÂ£fc. q
He thought the amendmertt proposed pre- 1'
ferable to the resolution reported, as it left it
the President to treat as he thought proper C
in'the bnfinefs. F
Mr. Nicholas did not fee much difference ri
betwixt the refolutioas. The one reported a
was advisory, as well as the amendment, al
The fit-ft, indeed, went on to fay the Presi
dent might afford temporary relief to the J
persons who had been removed from their
lands ; but if it were thought improper, as
he thought it was, to rccommsflfci a tempo
rary relief to be given to these persons who
had been driven from their property, it was
right to omit that part of it. He thought
to objeft to the amendment as being an in
terference with the executive authority, was n
an unauthorized refinement. It was not tl
asked, nor expefted, that money (hould be
distributed amongst these people by way of j
charity ; they were deprived of their prop- y
erty, aid they claimed a restoration of it.
If the proposed resolution were agreed to, ?
the President would still be at perfect liber
ty to atS as he pleased. Indeed, the Pre- 0
lldent having appointed commiflionery for "
holding a treaty, it would be aÂ£ting-in con- y
formity with him thus to aft. Mr. N. con- g
cltfded by reminding the house of the con- n
: fequeiices which might arise from negleft- "
â¢ ing to attehd to tl< just claims of persons
who were so far removed from the feac of i I:
, government, and who had it in their power I!
â  to do feiious mifchief to the United States. V
The chairman said, on recurring to the
1 rules of the house, he found the amendment j
â  proposed was not in order, as it was a sub
â  ftitute for the original motion. Th*- quef
-1 tion was, therefore, upon the resolution as
reported. â¢
Mr. Goodrich hoped the committee would
: rife, in order that the report might be re- (
committed, The resolution reported had
in view the temporary relief of the fufferings 1
of the people who had been driven from (
â  their lands, and to empower the President j
- of the United States, at his diferetion, to tx
' tinguifh the Indian title ; but the member '
. frora Tennessee, who must be supposed tobe '
: best acquainted with the intercft of his con- .
: ftituents, had now'brought forward a more J
- extensive proportion, which embraced the '
- idea of aÂ» extiaguifhment of the Indian ti
; tie to all the land in Tennessee. He did '
r not think the committee were ready to
- adopt so general a proposition, without
1 farther information. Besides, he thought !
â¢ the gronnd of this business was materially |
: changed by the President's having named
f comraiffioners to hold a treaty with the In
1' diaris; he thought it would be best, there
t fore, to wait for a communication from the
- President on the fubjeft, before the cora
s mittee proceeded further. He would not I
- havemade thts-mcitTwe, if hÂ« had thought it |
1 would occasion a delay injurious' to the
t petitioners; but as the gentleman from Ten
- neffee hirafelf had given up the idea of afford- !
- ing temporary relief, he trusted a delay of
. few days could have no bad effefts.
t Mr. W. Claiborne hoped the committee !
i would not rife. The chairmap having deci
t ded his amendment to be out oif order, the j
e reason for making the motion no longer exi- !
s fted, as there was no new proposition before j
e the house ; the proposition which was now j
0 before the committee had been pending five !
a vveeksâa proposition which, lie was perfua- j
d ded, every member in the house must be well!
s acquainted with ; since not to think so would
s be to think them indifferent to the claims
f of their fellowcitizens, whom the represented
e equally with himfelf who came there by their
3 fuffrages. If his amendment had not been
e declared out of order, he (hould have deli
r vered some ftntiments upon it, which would
r have lhe.ws that he did not intend to bring
.r the fubjeft before the house by surprize, but
that he was aftuated by the most honourable
e motives ;by a wifti to do justice Bot only
n to the persons whose distressed situation had
- been laid before the committee, but to all
0 those citizens of North Carolina, Tennessee
1- and other parts of the United States, who
1, had a legal right to land which, by the trea
ty of Holfton, had been ceded to the In
d dians. But by the dccifion of the Chutr
>, man he was prevented from doing this, and
is obliged to confine his obfervalion to the
d motion for the cohimittee to rife. He
is trusted this motion would be disagreed to.
>f The neceflities of the people c ailing for re
re lief were pressing. For months pail distress
1- had reigned on the frontier of Tennessee,
1- and several hundred families,, who, before an
e armed forcedrove tbemoff, were in thepeactv
ful possession of their land, and enjoying, iu
ie happy fufficiency, the fruits of their own
v industry ; but they hard been forced, at this
e inclement season, to seek an asylum wher
te ever they could find itâsome had been so
g fortunate as to get into house.3, but the
Id greater part had been obliged to take Ihel
fs ter in the woods, with their wives and lit
te tie ones. Where was humanity if that
a- House were disposed to procrastinate a de
-- cifion? He (hould fay that virtue had loft
it its customary feeling, if it ware not intcrefted
1, in behalf of these citizen*. The committee
had heard, from a refpeftable quarter, that
id the President of the United States had taken
ie up this business. He hoped the informa
y tion was correft ; if so, it redounded to the
i- j honour of our Chief Magistrate, and (hewed j
:o that he felt for the diftreffesof thefecitizens
in and since he proposed to negeciate a treaty
to ; with the Indians, the sooner an appropria
t, tion was made, the sooner would the grie
>e vances complained of be removed he hoped
e, therefore, the gentleman would withdraw
hs motion. With refpeft to his proposition
e- which baabcen|dcclared outoforder,he could
d- if he (hould fee proper, bring it forward
I; separately.
The debate on t'%" question for trie eum
tnittee to rife occupied the whole of the rr
mainder of th?diy ; bat as the rperits of *
the question were, according td.oider, pre- ?
eluded by it from difcuflion (though they J
were nof alwsys kept out of tightj we do .1
not think it necessary to go into a detail of
the arguments which were ufed.tbr and a
gainst the motion. The advocates of the
question were Messrs. N. Smith, Bfookes,
11. Williams, I. Parker, and Otis; against
it, Messrs. Veiiable, M'Dowell, Nicholas, S
Gallatin, Macou, R. Williams, Harper and hi
Rutledge. At length the motion was car
ried without aâ¢ division ; and on leave being
asked to fit a-Min, afftr foÂ«ie debate, it was ' a

also granted without a division. 11

BOSTON, January 3.
. It is certain that at the daft of the Jaft
accounts from Paris, our extra-commii'fion
ers had not entered into any discussions
whatever, on the fubjedt of their migion,
wfib the ruling powers of *ie French re
public.âThey have had, it is true, their
introduction of cefe/nonyto the minirter of
foreign affairs; but have done rib business
with him.âGen. Pinckney may have a pre
sentiment of the probable fate o? tlie em
bafly ; and from thence may have been anx
ious to provide against contingencies [ but
appearances may be delusive ; and notwith;
standing bis expectations, he may be agree,
ably difappointedjâShould the French a.
dopt Fauchet's advice, and fend'comnaif
fioners to treat in the U lited States, the
presence of our envoys at Paris Would un
questionably be dispensed with.
A gentleman from Cayenne informs us
of the arrival there'of the French citizens
diredted to be transported, by the decree of
September 4th. He saw them several times
and their deportment was melaHcholy tho'
firm. They vvÂ»re allowed to walk for exer
cise within certain limits j but they were
always attended by a guard. On their ar
rival, the commandant of the troops ad
dressed the foldier3 on the event; but instead
of the (houts of " Five la RepuUique," Sec.
which usually fuceeeded harangues this
kind, the foidiers remained silent and fad.
In all the - French papers we have seen,
not one word good, bad, or indiffere*t, ii

Philadelphia, December 18, 17971 j
New-Theatre,
December 11, 1797. j
THE Managers particularly rcquefl the con
currence, of the public in the'abolition of .a
cuiloai, which has hitherto obta:ned, of giving a- '
way or difpoSng ol RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre. h
They are aware that gentlemen are unconfeious
of any wrong done to, Me iuterefl of the inllitu
tionby thispraflice, from a general, though mis
taken idea that Checks are the reprefentativos of a
right to so many feats in tbe Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will; c
when in faft, they were never intended as more
than tvhtni by which the Door-keeperi are enabled
to afcMtain with the lt-aft trouble to the fartiei,th IVt. 1 Vt. r
tbty tbemfelvis have been before m the.lheatre, or ]
paid for their admission. t
Independent of the injury the Managers sustain, j
such a practice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other disorderly persons tofurrcmnd the doors of
the Theatfe, to the oorruption of their moral* and c
the i-reat annoyance of the Audience.
It has atfo been thefo*rce of two evils of no in- "
confideraWc magnitude ; one is, that f wnetimei '
very improper company is by these means admit- '
ted ; and the other, that to Checks passing ,
into difhotiell hartcls, they have be n frequenaly c
counterfeited to a large amount fqr the purpoftsof t
Sale. <
This ftatenient- will, it is refpeitfu'ly hoped, in
duce tfie Public to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus affiited,
easily pÂ»ove adequate to its entire abolition.
