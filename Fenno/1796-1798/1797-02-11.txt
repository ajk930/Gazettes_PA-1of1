New-Haven, 06tober 7, 1796,
Dear Sir,
I Ihould have written you lad week, had 1 then been
able to afccrtain certain fa<sU, the rumour of which I had
heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near neighbour to me, the wife
of Ehen Beers, and daughter of captain Samuel Hoggins,
of this town, had been, for fourteen weeks, exceedingly
uiftreffed with the Rheumatism, to such a degree that for
fourteen week* previous to the 19th of last month, she
had not keen able to walk aercjfs the room even with crut
ches favc only once, when Ihe made out with the nflift
ance'of crutches to hobble part of the way acro s her room. T
On the 19th of September last, (he procured a set of your ti
mctvllic fubiWes, and in lefsthan an hour after she had
Ke Â£ un to use them, in the manner dirtied by you, she o
rose from her chair, and walked about her house, and on a
the next dav Ihe went abroad to her neighbours, having
thrown aside her crutches. I have this day paid her a visit v
â in company with-her lather, and Timothy Jones, Esq. I
who lives in the street where she reQdes and directly op- si
posit- to her rrfidence, and with Capt. Abel Burrett, who it
is her nex'- neighbor, and lives within eight yards of her a
door. -1 requested her to relate her cafe over in their tl
pre fence, which she did, and thefts gentlemen all with one t]
voice, fu'ppurted, from their own knowledge, her story. 'r
,|t is a duty whifh yoa owe yourfijf and the world to pro- t
Bulge this event. ' I am, very refyeftfully, . v
Your obedient fÂ»rvant, I
NRRPONT EDWARÂ»B.

returned, and (he is in a fairway to be rellored to perfect a
health. 11
Rev. Mr. Spalding, of Salem. d
This may certify, that the fubferiber, i n his visits among t
his people, has used Dr. Perkins's metallic paints, to re- t
â¢liere paias and inflammations of various kinds, and has i
â¢succeeded to his aftoniihment. They have seldom failed
to relieve the head-aeh, tceth-ach, ague in the face, in-- 1
flauimati.;* in the eyes, cramp, cholic, rheumatism, pains 0
of the bread and lid., biles, scalds and burnsâSometimes 1
there has been a perfed: cure from one operation. A lad
who had been confined three days with high symptoms of t
a fever, very hot and full of pain, by an operation of the 1
points, designed to relieve his head, his face tamed pale 5
andi cold, his fever and pain immediately left him, and in 1
a few days he was out of doors ; the year before, at the
fame feSfon, he was taken with the fame symptoms, and ji
lay extremely Tick forty .lays. The efficacy of the metal
lic points has gained great credit" in this town. (

I certify, that on the 21ft of March, 1796, I saw Dr. t
Perkins's method of cure by pointed metallic instrument*,
tried with success in the poor-house or bettering-houfe in
yi.il.. d ; firperiall.y npan a man who was unable to ]
lift his right hand to his head, as was tried beforehand, but c
who after a few minutes operation, was able to remove it C
at pleasure ; and in my fight, put it with ease on the top
of his head and back of his neck, and in all dire&ions.
Nearly the fame eflfeA took place upÂ»n a woman ; and
all that I saw treated, profeffed that their pains <"eased
after being treated a Ihorftime : ana feyeral came volun
tarily , and in tny hearing thanked the Dr. tor cures he !
had performed on them about eight weeks before, in re-- '
moving pains from them, which they declared had not
since returned :âfo that from what I saw with my own
-eyes, and what I have heard, I have great hopes that this
methed will greatly tend to alleviate the miseries of man
kind. â ; ELUANAN WINCHESTER.
Philadelphia, April 4, 1796.
Extract from a Providence Papsr.
Communication.
Dr. Perkins's invention for removing pains from the
human body, begins to obtain reputation in proportion
to its utility and efficacy. The Cmplieity of the operati
on was at firft an obstacle to its credit; butithe flood of c
vidence in its favof, from a&ual experiment, is at length
too powerful to be refilled.

MOST delightfully situated on the north bank of Rap
pahanock river, opposite the town of Fredsriekfburg, in
the state-os Virginia, confiding of eleven or fiiteen hun
dred acres, as may best suit the putchafer. There is on
this estate, a large and well built brick house, containng
nine commodious rooms, exclufiveof a spacious hall or en
try, 22 feet pair of stairs, suitable and conven
ient piffa-jes, rfnd excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine hclthy eminence, commanding beautiful vuws ia
every dire&ton over the towns of Frederickiburgh and
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country. âThe
ground! adjoining the house are neatly laid Out in pleas
ure end kitchen gardens intsrfperfed with a variety of
scarce trees, achoice coile&ion of flowers and flowering
{hrubs, and enriched by various forts of the following
fruits, viz apples, pears, walnuts, chefnuts,cherries,peach
es, plumbs, ne&arines, apricots, grapes, figs, ralberries,
gocieberries.ftrawbemei, and currants; the whele admi
rably varied by turfed slopes which have been formed by
great labour and expence. Bordering upun theft im
provements, ate leveral lots, in a highitate of cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from
which three heavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large and flourifhing orchards; one
of well chosen peach trees, the ether of apple and pearÂ«
trees, felexftedfrom the best nurseries in the Hate. Pro
perly detached from the mansion house are extensive
room/offices of every denomination, viz a Kitchen and
Larder, ho'ufe-kecper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
underneath for a variety of purposes, a flore-loufe and
smoke house allof brick, a dairy and spring house of ftonek
Stables for thirty horses, an J coaeh houses for four car
riages. Also a large and well planned farm yard, v ith
barn and granary, a cow house, with separate [stalls for
thirty-fix grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals,
muttons and lambs ; extensive feeds for sheep, and other
arrangements for stock of every description, with a large
and convenient receptable for provender, from which they
can be furnilhed without being exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's (hop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourers.
The arable lands are fÂ» advantagcoufly divided as to af
ford an opportunity of making a lirgfi quantity of Indian
corn annually, without bringing the field into similar cul
ture oftner than once in four years; consequently the
lands may be improrved by keeping up the inclofures during
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On the prcmifes there is also a merchant mill with one
pair of best French burr stones, and one pair of Cologne ;
furnilhed with modern machinery, and now leafed for the '
unexpired term oi four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, which is near
ly 1001. more. The mill and miller's house are built of
free stone, within a very fraall distance of navigation,near
to which are two or more valuable lilhcries, and a well
accustomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Fredericklburg. The land con tains inexhaustible quarries
of free stone near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water and poflefles a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be eonfiderably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. In fall, exclusive of
an improveable and well conditioned farm, the value and
emolument inseparably connected witn a mill, ferries,
fifheries and quarries eligibly fltuated ; the profits ariling
from an ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetable!
of 4 all forts as to be fully equal to the demand in market,
thÂ»re might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives ituaneceffary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
pleafaKt and healthy residence, poffefling beauties and
conveniences fufficient to attra<9 the attention of any per
son desirous of becoming a purchaser
The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where be
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood Of that city
The pÂ«r<;hafer may be accommodated with a fe*r slaves
in families, either for plantation or doraeftic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly secured.

inhabitants'were severely wounded. How this un
fortunate altercation took place, we cannot at pte
fert Rate."
The occurrence which gave rife to the above pa
ragraph was (imply as follows :
Sundry persons belonging to the Medusa frigate
being somewhat intoxicated on Sunday lad, came
into the town of Portsmouth, and there were guilt/
of a breach of the "peace, by fighting with each
other.âA magistrate of the town chancing to pass
at that time thought it his duty to interpose his
authority and accordingly had one of the greatest
offenders taken into ctiftody, whom he ordered to
be sent to jaiU
All further riotous proceedings were thus quelled
for the time, by this measure, as well as through
the exertions of an officer oftbe frigate who hap
pened to be present. But whilst the constables
were about to conduit their prisoners to the coun
ty jail, they were overtaken by a boat with several
men belonging to the Medusa, who rescued the pri
soner-âthey were however immediately hailed and
ordered to come on shore by the officer above men
tioned ; they obeyed the summons, when the pri
soners were again delivered to the Magistrate. A;
number of the Medufa'screw, however hearing the
disturbance aod not knowing what had given rife
thereto, came forward armed, and a second time j
took the prisoners out of the hands of the officers of
the peaceâSome refinance was made, and it was
here that the magistrate received, what he himfelf
"calls a flight scratch, in the thigh fronT a bayonet.
Thus ended this " serious fraeas," iti which it han
been said a " Magiftratea few of ik* tnaft rgf.
" peCtable inhabitants were severely wounded."
The Consul of the French Republic has done e
very thing in his power to make fatisfaÂ£lionâhe
lias ordered the man to be given Bp to the law, and
eight of the most culpable are now in confinement.
Uncommon industry has however been used to give
this affair the word afpeftâand such were the re
ports current that we believe {he Editors oftUe He

NEW-YORK, Feb. 9.
At a meeting of theJ)emocratic Society of Phila
delphia, held en Thursday the 9th January, 1794,
the following refutations [among others] were
unanimously agreed to.
6th. " Resolved that the conduct of the mari
time powers at war with the French republic, in
prohibiting the exportation of our produce to
France and her colonies, and in ieizing our vessels
laden with provisions for that country, is a daring
infringement of the established law ewf nations, and
ought to be resented with a proper spirit.''
7th. " Resolved, that we conceive we oaght to
resent the outrageous tonduS of Great Britain in im
pressing our seamen, in leizing our vessels on the
high seas and detaining them in their ports on the
most frivolous pretencesâand in short, in carrying
on against this country a covert of insidious war
fare, which evinces her fear of our power, at the
fame time that it Can leave us no doubt tf her hatred
and enmity." [Signed] ,
JOHN SMITH, Sec'ry
As the French afe now outrageously seizing our
vessels on the high seas and detaining and condemn
ing them when bound to-their enemies ports in vio
lation of their treaty, as well as the law of nations ;
the foregoing resolutions are recommended to the
notice of the republicans, who celebrate the anni

[From a Cbrrefpenderit>.]
THE democrats call the federalifts the Briti/h
party, who in turn retort upon the democrats the
appellation of French party.
Time, the great friend of truth, (las at length
decided these crofs-adtions in his high court of ap
peal. For we have had British spoliations on our
trade ; and French fpolintions. The conduit of
the two parties on these two oecafions forms a faith
ful ted of their real principles. Words are but
â wind, and arc most lavishly used when th<re is the
most occasion to deceive.
The federalifts did not jujlfy the British fpolia
â  tionsâthe democrats do those of the trench, and
!fay we have provoked themâsuch traatment it good
â¢enough for us, &c.
The federalifts said, try negociation fit ft. Se
â¢quefter British debts, said the demosâNo envoy
No treatyâReprisalsâEmbargoâProhibit com
merce, &c.
As to French spoliations, federal men, troe to
their old principles, iofift, we mnfl cultivate har
mony with all nationsâgen. Pinckney we (.ope will
remove the affe&ed pretexts of French complaint.
The democrats not content with this, multiply ex
pressions of affedtion for France and their ctirfes on
our own government âinstead of demanding jus
tice, they encourage more capturesâthey give a
flipper to Barney for psblifhing his orders-to plun
der his own countrymen.
Yet the democrats called our feuding an envoy to
Great Britain pufillar.imcut.
The propriety of this charge is also put in its true
light by facts The Federalists avowed that if Bri
tain refufed justice, they wouldfight herâbut to
alk for it, feeiued too puiillanimous to tile Scmo
cratfc heroet.
France has played the pirate on onr trade in con
tempr of treaties. The Federalists fay not a word
about fighting France, they move in Cungrefe no
fequeflration or prohibition acts or embar;j.->. The
champions of ibcfe honefiand wife meafure# are now
mute. Nay, because it.p FederaliKs speak of rfs

From 1 Paris paper of Dec. r-
Until we (hall leceive the reports of the command

of the army of Italy not having y(t allowed him to
give an account of the fucceflea he has obtained, we
publish here a letter from general Berthier, command
er of the general ftaff, containing an analysis of his
glorious victories. 4
The divisionary general commander of the slate, to
general Baraguay d'Hilliers, commandant of Lom
bardy.
" Head-quarters at Verona,
" Nov. 19, sixth year.
" At length, my dear general, after the boldest ma
noeuvres, the most obflinate confliits, and eight days
spent without taking off our boon, w> have just de
feated general Alvinzy and his array, which we have
pursued to'Vincenza. Five thousand prisoners, three
tiioufand men killed and wounded, four flags and twelve
guns are the fruits of these vidtories. Alvinzy is about
rto rally behind the Brenta. âDavidovich, who is ig
norant of what iÂ« become of Alvinzy, Is on the right
bank of the Adige, after having forced Vaubois' di
vision, and having advanced to the other fide of'Ki
voli. We are fearful that hÂ« is retreating , if he is
flill at this time in his positions, to-morrow he will be
ours, with the fix thousand men he commands. Five
I'armee d'ltalie .' Mantua will soon be in the hands of
the Republicans.
" Never were anions fought with so muth ebftina
~cy. We have had two generals mortatly wounded, &
five others of whose recovery hopes are entertained.
Amotig the killed we reckon two of the commander in
chief's aids-de camps, and an adjutait-gencral.
" I have not time to fay any more. We have still
to fight. There will be no repose until the enemy

Message from the Executive Directory to the Councils,
dated 10 Fritaaire, Nov. 30, fifth year.
" Citizens Legislators,
" We wait impatiently for the official difpatchcs
of the commander in chief, Buonaparte, to communi
cate to you the decisive viflory which hasjuft been ob
tained under his command, by the army of Italy. Ne
ver was that brave army placed in so critical a pofitien.
The enemy had made the greatcft tftey had
brought from the interior of the states all that they
had left of dilpofable forces. These troops they had
marched to their deftinalion with the utmost lpeed,
and had eontrived 10 form in Italy a new army, more
considerable than the two former, already exterminst
ed, before the fuccorsfent from the interior of France,
to the commander in chief Buonaparte, could form a
junction with the army of Italy. It required nothing
less than the genius of that intrepid warrior, the ta
lents of the general officers and of the individuals who
seconded them at the price of their blood, and the zeal
and constancy of all our brave brethren in arms, to
triumph over so many obstacles which the despair of
our enemies had opposed to us.
" The refalt of the bloody conflidls, which were
fought for eight successive days, is the loss Â«n the part
of the enemy of twelve thousand men in killed, wound
ed and prisoners, four flags and eighteen guns. The
present petition of the armies promises new fuccefles,
and the capture of Mantua, on which the fate of Ita
ly depends.

Letter of General Berthier, Chief of the Staff of
the army of Italy.
" Head quarters at Verona,
Nov. 19th fifth year.
" The activity in wÃich we have been for this
fortnight pad would not permit me to write to you
as often as 1 could have wished, but the command
ant of Lombardy, te whom I sent a summary ac
count of our movements, mull have transmitted yon
a copy of the fame
" Since onr last affair at Caldero, which toek
place on the 22d (N*vembei 12) and wherein,
after an obflinate eombat, the two armies remained
in their positions, general Alvinzy had effetfted his
junction with a column from Tyrol, and had an
army of upwards Â»f 40,000 men.
" On the 24th (Novembei 14) the hostile ar
my was in prelence, and preparing to give a pitch,
ed battle. General Buonaparte, apprised of the
enemy's jnteations, immediately made moneeuvreS
to fruftrate them.
" I" night between the 24th and 2 jth
(November 14th and 15th) he ardered the division
of general Vaabois tÂ® gaard the position of Rivo.
li, to keep in check the column of the enemy's
right wing, commanded by general Davidovich.
The caftleand citadel of Brescia, Verons, the polls
of Pefchiera and Legnago were in a refpeftable
state of defence. The commander iu etiief sta
tioned some corps of light troops and flying artil
lery to defend the passages of the Adige ; in the
fame night he had a boat-bridge raised at Ronco
;o pass the Adige, to fall unexpefttdly Ã¼bon gene'
ral Alvmzy's off his communication, feixe
his magazines and his pa r k of artillery, deprive him
of ail means of fiibfiftence, and at last to attack him
from the rear. Before day-break the divisions of
MaUeiÂ«a and Angereau had already crossed the
Adige, and advanced on two roads, which erofcan
impassable marfli of several miles.
" JjV ol "â¢ left, commanded by irc
neral Mafftna, was the firft to fall in with
the enemy 3 out posts, which it worsted; that of
the right, commanded by general Angereau, having
alforepulfed several hostile posts was (lopped .t tl,e
village Areole, occupied by the Auftrians, whose
fire flanked the dyke on which it was necessary to
pass to penetrate thnher. Arcania, whieh bordered
ttiis dyke on the tide of the village, prevented its
bein s turned ; u wa, therefore neeeffary, iâ order
10 become rnaft m of it> to fs th Â£
and cross a small bridge defended by several I.
| attled houies, from whi#h th? enemy dircfled a
-teirlbli fire. Our troops ptifhci federal ' iirtes For
wards with charge ftcps, to carry the bridge, but
not having in the fi r # isftance displayed the fÂ«me
boldness as they did at the bridge Lodi, they
were repuifed in their repeated attempts; in vain
KaÂ»! general Angereau, with a Itandard in his hand,
advanced at the head of tjie cÂ«lumn to take Ar
cole.
" The commander in c(iief, wha was informed
of the difficulties which the diviEons of general
Angereau had to sustain, gave orders to general
Guieux to march down the Adige, .with a corps
of 2000 .men, and to pass the river under cover of
our light artillery, at a ferry which was at thedif
tance of two miles below Renco, facing Alberedo ;
he had ordete to march to the village of Arcole to
tarn it : but that was a long march, the day was far
gone ; and it was of the higWeft importp.sce to cap
ture Arcole, in order to get into the enemy's rear
before they were able to learn our movement.
" The commander i* chief advanced with his
whole ftaff at the head of the division of Angereau;
he reminded oar brothers in arms of their being
the fame men that had forced the bridge of Lodi.
He faemed to perceive a fentimant ofenthufiafm,
and was determined tfl profit by it. He leap;a off
his harfe, seized a standard, rushed forwaid at the
head of the grenadiers, and ran tcf the head of the
bridge, crying, " Fallow your General !" The
culumn instantly moved on, and we were at the
distance of 30 yards from the bridge, wheH the ter
rible fire of the enemy aiTailed the column, and
made it fall back the very moment when the enemy
were going to take Sight. It was at the fame in
stant that generals Vignollcand Lafne were wound
ed, and that Muiron, aid-de-camp to the commander
in chief, was killed.
" The commander in chief and his ftaff were
overwhelmed ; the commandei in chief himfelf was
thrown from his horse into a marsh, from whence,
under tKf enemy's fire, he extiicated himfelf with
difficulty ; lit mounted again, the celumn rallied,
and the enemy durst oat come forth from their en
trenchments.
â¢*' Night began, when general Guieux arrived cou
rageously at the village of Arcole, and finally tarried
I it; but he retired in the night, after having made ma
ny prisoners, and carried off four pieces of cannon.
I he eneipy had had time to be aware of our
movement; they had begun to fend off all their bag
gage and magazines to Vincenza, and concentrated al
most their whole force towards Konco, to give batt.le ;
and before day break they occupied the village of Ar
cole with considerable force.
" On the i6th (Nov. 16.) at day break, the enemy
attacked us on all points ; the column of general Maf
fena, after an obllinate confiiel, worsted the enemy,
took 1500 prisoners, and carried off fix pieces of can
. non and four stand of colours.
" The column of general Angereau likewise repui
fed the enemy, but could not succeed in forcing the vil
lage cf Arcole, which was again attacked several times,
You will judge of the obstinacy of the different attacks
upon this village, where seven generals were wounded.
" The fame evening the commander in chief him
felf marched to the canal on the right of the Adige,
with a column who carried fafcines, with a view of ef
tablifhiug a pafTage, which could not be dome on ac
count of the current ; then the adjutant general Vial,
who was at the. head of the column, forded the canal,
up to his neck in water, but he was obliged to repafs
It : it was at that moment<that Elliot, aid-de-camp to
the commander in chief, was killed. *
" The following night the commander in chief gave
orders to throw a bridge over the canal, aud a new at
tack was combined for the Â»7th ( Nov 17.) The di
vision of general Ma (Ten a was to attack on the left of
the causeway, and that of general Angereau, for the
third time, the celebrated village of Arcole, while a
third column was to cross the canal to turÂ» that village.
Part of the gaiifon of Porto Legnago. with'fifty hor
lts and four pieces of artillery, received orders to turn
the enemy s left, for the pvrpofe of operating a diver
sion.
" The attack began at day break, the fight was ob
ltmate, Maffcaa's cblumu met with less obftacies, but
that of Angereau was again repuifed at Arcole, and
tailing back in disorder to the bridge of Ronco, when
t.ie divifiou of Maffena, who had followed the move
ment, made a retrograde moti<!ii towxrds the division
of Angereau, and disposed. itfelf to join it for the pur-
P making a frefh attack upon the enemy, who
were for this time put'no flight, and who, feeing them-
I s turned by the left, were forced at Arcole : then
the route was complete, tlyry abandoned all their posi
tions, and retreated to Vicenza ia the night. I
" On the 28th (Nov. 18,) at day break, part of the
Trench army pursued the enemy to Vicenaa, took se
veral barges laden with their pontoon floret, picked up
lorne prisoners, and many wounded, and the others ar
rived under the -.vails of Verona.
" Bu/mg out success at Ronco, our left wing com
manded at Kivdft, which place the enemy occupies at
this very moment. The right wing of the Imperial
army, commanded by general Davidovich, will be at
tacked to-morrow by superior forces, and mull entirely

Mr. Swan wick faidJhat if the gentleman last up could
make good his calculations, he should agree with him
there would be no immediate neceflity for new taxes Â£
but even if tfcis were the cafe (which he was far from
fceing convinced of) he should wish a fyltcm of dire<S
"xatioh to be commenced, in order to have a certain
Q f revenue; any surplus arising from which
wouid jj t we j| eon ployed in discharging a t>ait as our
publ.c c-Ht.
. ' ' ,c 8 e, ''<-man from New-Jersey (Mr. Henderfon)
ad laid the had never recommended direii
axes ; he believed \he President knew 100 iVetl the pri-
and duties er that Hoi<fe to interfere in any
ing which related origin of revenue ; but lit
a ' K rc at propriety, in his opinion, frequently
rged the necefltiy Â°f discharging the public debt, a
Â« which, Mr. S. laid, if oat jot rid of, thie*fened
Â» the extlnflion of the government itfÂ«!f. Thefiindinp
fyflem, he said, had been the ruin of every cotlstry ft
1 which hid adoped it ; because one generation put off
, to another wiiat was its duty to have done for itfelf,
viz. to pay its debts. A debt of So millions, he said, "
called loudly for exrtnflion. 0
If it was admitted, in order to reduce ourdiebt, and a
make provifisn ror the futuce, frefh revenues were ne- a!
ceflary, it became neceflary for them to compare the d
merits of the two systems proposed to their view for b
raiting this money. They-muft examine the objections j,
against onÂ«, and against the olher The great objee- .
tion urged against a dire<Â®> tax, was the difficulty of
obtaining mÂ«ney from farmers in remote parts, Â«nd :
of obtaining a just valuation of property, and the ex- Vl
pence of colle&'iHg the tax. As far as thefc obje&ions I
had any weight, government tiould make efforts ta
1 surmount the difficulties. But it was laid, it would be n
a long time before this tax could be brought into 6pe- t |
ration j if io, it was neceflary to make a beginning,
finee without a beginning they would never expeift to n
come to the end. _ . "
But was it not, he alked, acknowledging a principle ti
dangerous to the exigence of government,<to fay it t
vys impoflible te collea a tax 01, hnd ? [Mr. Harper v
said he haÂ«l never said or thought so] Mr. S. said he t .
believed fmt such thing hid been said ; the difficulties ,
had been stated by different gentlemen as infurmounta
b'e, and it became neceflary to leruove these difficiil
Â» ties. Su'ppofe a war was to take plate, was that the 1
â¢ time, he asked, to commence a. fyflem of this kind 1 F
- he believed not. Such a season would be the very fc
' worst for colleifting taxes. And was this country so p
e fltuatcd, there was no poflibility of being involved in g
war ! No matter from what quarter ; whether it was ,
with France or with Kngland, it was neceflary tÂ» guard
against fueh an event by making our revenues sure.
e How could wc meet any foreign nation upon equal 1
t terms in treaty, when they could fay to us, if you f
- not so and so, we will destroy your commerce and pa- 1
e ralyze your revenue. In time of peace, he said, this ,
3 business Ihould be attended to; if it were not, how
would gentleman accofe themselves if war should over- !
take them ? Miey would certainly haye much r&afon
. to do it 1
t With refpea to a land tax, Mr. S. said, it was cer- 1
* tain, equal, and might be collected with little expence. I
For, notwithstanding what gentlemen had said, the- 1
r expence incurred was only at the commencement; as
e when an affeflment was once ma'de it would last for
- many years.
c We know, said Mr. S.that a window tax, a hearth ;
tax, a tiamp tax, and an excise, cause murwurrngs '
and difcontc-nts wherever they are established ; but in. 1
no country has a land|tax be"tn grievous; except, in- i
deed, in France, .where the extenflve property of the }
" elergy and nobles under the old government was ex
e empied from the tax. In England, there wtrt also '
d some ebjeaions to the tax, from its beiog from '
what is called the Dtomfday Boifi (a very antient re- '
cord) by which means the tax falls unequally, ,as, 1
t fin>"e that time, lands have l*o greath - changed iu value, I
j that a new afl'efTment is become neceflary to make the 1
tax equitable and unobje<9ionable.
But, he said, were these not some circum/tances at
r present which marked the time as proper for laying a '
b tax on laitd ? Did not every one know that the very
high price of produce must have put the farmer in a '
- si tu at ion to contribute feme portion to the exper.fes of 1
1- tbe ftateWould they be better able to pay wlien 1
I their produce should become lower 1 They certainly
would not. He was not, he said, more delirous than
â _ others, to call u h ioii country gentlemen, he did it only
from neceflity. VVhen he considered the danger of be
ing left without revenue, he could not refrain from
g making tlfe call, and he believcdtheie would be found
15 virtue enough amongst the farmers, iÂ« bring them
y forward cheerfully to pay what the wants of govern
r> ment required.
9 Hf saw no objection to a land tav that might not be
e removed. Whether the mode recommended by the
gentleman from Miflachufetts ( Mr. Varnurn) or any
other would be best, was not then the quaftign, but
e weald be decided at a proper time. It had been said
1- that farmers paid their proportion of indireA taxes ;
!, if so, he said, they could not complain of a land tax,
, a= that would not fall heavier upon them than any 0-
ther tax would do. But gentlemen said an indiretf
tax cbyld be evaded ; he thought there was no excel
lence in that quality of * tax, but the contrary, fmce
the greatest recommendation of a tax was, that it fell
16 equal. All taxes on consumable articles, he said, bore
it very unequally. A poor family consumed much
rpore of them than a rich small one.
It had frequently been said that all duties upon goods
imported, were paid by the eoiifumers. He believed
this uas not so; and he fancied any one who looked
/- into the vendue stores, asd saw merchandize felling
y for the amount in currency, of what it cost in sterling,
would ruh no riik in faying, that the duty was not
paid by the purchaser, whoever else might pay it.
indirect taxes, lie said, fell very heavy upon per- '
sons who lived upon the iptereft of money, or upon
falatics ; because though they were eontinnally tax
ed by advaHces of duties, their incomes remained
the fame. On that ground, Mr. S. said, they hid
lately bad many applications from their officers for
advances of salary.
Such a fyflem, Mr. S. said, was a proper part,
but not a complete revenue system. In all govern
' tax and inspolU were introduced as pio
per companions ; but here all deponded upon im
port, which was liable at all times to be cut off.
! No gentleman had said any thing in answer to that
y objeÂ£lion Nothing rrfuld be said against the truth
x of that position. How very paflible was it, he said
" that they might hear in the spring, of the William
'â¢ Perm, the Adrians, and other ships being taken.
e ! inflead of coming into our port. And if such a
rl thing should happen, it would be hundreds ef thou
sands of.dollais loft to our revenue. Was it not
n necefiary then, to be provided against any misfor
'â¢ tunes which might happen ? Or would gentlemen
x have the treasury tÂ» flop payment in Â«efe of such
an event ? And he would ask gentlemen at what
rate they would insure the .arrival of these vessels ?
He be'ieved the price would be high.
The plan therefore'uf the gentleman /rem South
Carolina (Mr.'Harper) held aut a vain depend
ancee, when he retted it upon an advance of inij
polls. And what ct.i.ld be thought of a window
d tax ? The most odious tax in Great Britain, and a
n tax that would be highly dcprecatcd in this country
> Indt*d he could remember the time, when it would
not have been very' fafe for a person to have pro- '
posed a ftaiiip-rax, a hearth-tax, or a window lax 1
'An hearth tax and a window tax were the mod fla
r vifh of taxes. What I said he, shall one man enter j
ear houses and count and tax our hearths, and a
) nother come and peep and examine into our win
dows ! God forbid 1 The injustice of such taxes
was not greater than their baleful nature, since a
rich man by ,no means paid his proportion of them,
y When fucn objects were brought forward as fnb
a Ititutes for a tax on land, it was a pretty strong
il prcfumptien in iu favyr.
- . Â»
? How did the gentleman intent? to convey tii .
ftampa to ali part* of the Ur.ioi) ? How would
men a tax affect tlie farmer, who might have many
miles to ride for a stamp before Tie could give a note
or take a rerept. The objt&ioa formerly made to
j a ifamp-tax, it had been laid, was because it was l '
â - about tÂ® be enforced by a foreign government )he a
e did not ti.ink that was the whole objection. He Â°
r believed the tfling was objectionable on account of f'
its inequality. In Biitain it was produ&ive ; in â¢'
j. Philadelphia and other large i towns, it w u!d also
j be pradafli/e ; but could not be expended with con- "
veniertce ovtr theSiates of Kentucky ar.d TenuefTee.
9 It woutd either be evaded or opprcilive. t!
By additional duty on fait, would not the poor l !
e rain be affected in a much greater proportion than
, | the rich ! tie certainly would, since some poor fa- a
0 mihea used as much [alt as a rich one ; and would
not Jtich a tax tempt the farmer to give a less quan- 1
!e tit }' to hi* cattle than was iieceftVry for them ? ''
it And were landed gentlemen certain that such a tax
r would be mere acceptable to farmers than a land P
â j tSX ' not know whether tjie additional
duty might not .also encourage smuggling. '
1- Gentlemen had said, that whenever peace (hould
ie take place in Euiope, great emigrations would take â '
1 p'-ice to thia country, and gieat wealth would be K
y brought in. He believed if any thing would draw
Â° per !oni from foreign cauntiies to thin, it would be t
a profpeft of enjoying liberty, under wife and equal
â d l aw 's* He beneved it would not be the molt effec- ''
tunl way of inviting Irifhmcn to this couutry, to
a] tell them we had a hearth tax, or Etrgliihmen by
Iq, speaking to them of a window tax, or the people of
a- France by a fait tax ! It was the gieateft reeona-
meniiation of a tax that it fell equally on property ; t
and whatever tax did io, he said., was a good'tax.
in a^crt * < i that if a land tax had been laid 11
long ago, it wnald have been of infinite service to Â®
r- the country, as it would probably have prevented
e. some tuitions financial systems from taking place. '
wa * *' I ' 4 potlif bodies as with individuala.
!he more cafy they get money, the more liberally e
they Ipend it. It was, theiefore, a happy circum- j 0
llartce for this country that we could no longer bor- i Â£
row money. When they Were called upop for a i
irv loan of 300,000 dollars for the city, if it
n- Sad bstn to be railed fr.om the land, it would not I
>Â« have been foeafily granted. This land tax would j r
so ?P eratff " a ~lew spring in favour of government ; j
in ' l wo aw >ken the attention of the farmer to its '
e _ operations ;to enquire ofthe why and the where- '
s, ole â¢ 'he bufrnefs of treaties, when money was J
e, to be granted,the farmer would be ip favour of trea
ie ties only in proportion as he chose to pay a tax on
his land. It was tafy to grant money ; but when
? a came every gentleman witbedto
r y P u ' '' from his own (houlders, one wiftied it to
a he raised from land ; another from wine ; another
of from hearths or windows ; or any thing so that if
en did not effect him or bis constituents in any sensible 1
iy degree.â 1 his wa* the reason fe was glad they '
an were brought to the neceflity of providing money
â J_ before they could difpoft-of it. They had this fef
m lion had fume noble pi.'Ti 3 on foot ; fhey had heaid
ilc j something el a national univerlity, of relieving the
in fuffeters *t Savannah, tic. b'ut now ifiere was a
n- call for money, every o e wifheduo put off the de
mand from himfelf upon his neighbour.
|' c Mr. S said hÂ» regretted the neeeflity of enlling Â«pon
â  c the farmer ; but he believed it necessary. When gentlc
tiy men frated the poverty and mdaftty of that elafÂ» of citi
nt zens, he felt as much tor them and' had X* much zeal for
ltd their ..itereli as any man ; nor did he wiih invidioui dif
-1 tinÂ£iunt to be drawn between the merchant and the far
x, mer. The merchant wai an agent of the farmer ; bnt
o- the agent wa* in the worst fitiurion, because his property
'(si was the tirft to be deilroycd. Hereaui in his newspaper
e l. at home that the l rench, the Englift and the Algcrints
cc taks our flups; but his corn and grass glow, and his dol
'cjl lars arc fate. He could come down to Congrefj.and talk
, re very coolly about laying addj idnal duties on cammcrce ;
C J ) but if his land wan mentioned as a fit ohj-A of tsxatien,
he immediately taok the alarm. He thought landed gen
(jJ tlemsH Oiould be inclined rather tÂ» fympathiite with the
merchants in thair einbarraflments; and Jf they were not
e j ' td hy more generÂ«us motives to dn this, ev> a intcreft
fliould lead them to it, since they would be the latl to be
"5 devoured I N
Let all rjnks, then, said Mr. S. in conclufiou, unite
10 in putting their (boulders to the wheels of government ;
acd since commerce pay. her five millions, let agricul
:r" ture pay its something ; this would %w a real attach
on ment to our country. He had heard much said about
X- federalifm and friends of government i he thought
ed those would shew themfeives the truest fedcralifts and*
a( J friends of government, who fttpped forward in aid of
or its Hecefiitics He trusted gentlemen would fuffer their
! immediate interests to give way, in order 19 have the
finances of the country fixed upon a foundation which
