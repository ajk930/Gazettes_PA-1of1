LONDON, May 21. -
Wcbear, that it is at length finally concluded
that tlx; Princess Royal is to give her hsnd to the
Prince of Wirtemberg. Count Z ppcli it is said
has been the fuectfsful suitor for his prince on the
occasion. _
The Autfrian general Argenteau, second ill com
mand, has been arretted ona charge of mifcondutt
during the late campaign in Itidy, mio is to be
brought to a court martial. He is a priiofier ai
Mautua.
The report of peace is again very prevalent in
London, and the return of Mr. Netmai/ from Pa
ri* is anxiously expected. This gentleman has been
associated with M, Charretier, as agent for French
prifonens in this country, and approved of as filch
by our Ministry. He was formerly under M. Bar
thelami," in the service of .the French Ambaflador
in London ; and was sent off on Monday fe'night
express to Paris, supposed to be charged with a
mission of importance. An express was sent off to
Dover 12 hows before Mr, Nctman left London,
with a letter from the,. Duke of Portland to the
Mayor, to let this gentleman meet with no delay,
and that a packet mighf be in readiness to receive
him. He failed from Dover to Calais under a flag
oftrueeand was only two hours and a haif on his
paflage. Mr. Charretier accompanied him to Do
ver, but not to France.
Scarce any thing of the events which have occur
red in the progress of the French revolution arc more
extraordinary than those of the present day. Al
most in the fame fitting of their kÂ«giflative bodies,
theyconfult on the firft movements towards peace,
made by Mr. Wiekham to Mr. Barthelemi, they
receive news of victories decisive of the fate of Italy
and the submissive proposals for peace from Sardi
nia and Naples, aod in the fame breath they an
nounce to the. people that a conspiracy has been just
discovered in the perpetration, headed by men of
the firft abilities, ibme of them of the legislative bo
dy, threatening the mafiacrc of all the conftitutcd
authorities, and the re-establishment of the bloody
fyttem of 1793.
The conspirators accuse the present powers of
intending to restore the monarchy they retort the
charge on the conspirators and urge the nation to
oppose the reftoratiori of the conltituticro of 1793
to the utmost, as the o<ily means of ettablifhing the
Republic and the liberty of France.

A letter from the Hague, of the 18th inft fays,
that the Committee of Union having communica
ted to the National Assembly the contents of a note
from Gen. Btouinonville, in which he infills, that a
commander in chief of the army of the State (hall

him with full power.

At the close of the. Poll for Weftmiofter, on
1 Friday, Mr. Fox and Home Tooke addrefled the
" mob, in pretty long speeches :âthat of the former
; Gentleman was the molt inflamatory we aver heard.
t He said (among other strong thinga)- he re
: mcmbered but two Wars in which this country lias
1 been engagedâthe one directed against the Liber.
ty of America, the other against the Liberty of
j Franceâboth caused by the despotic principles of
. the existing the present War
a was nothing more nor less than a combination of
- despots to overturn the liberties of Europe. That
a constitution was good, exadUy in proportion to
r the (hare that the people" had in tjie government of
the countryâthat the sovereignty was in thÂ»peo-
P le - . ,
He cautioned the people against entertaining the
fantaiiic notionâthat ail exiftingconftitution might
not be destroyed.
He spoke of Mr. H. Tooke as a gentleman
>. whom he refpeded, and whom he Â«onfidered as the
I injured and perfected man alive ; this speech
r might be called a canvass for Mr. Tooke.
s. Mr. H. 1 ooke said, I uat he would o6t conti
c nu,e a candidate, if heconceived, that by so doing,
r he would endanger Mr. Fox's eleaion. He agreed
in every finglc fenliment that Mr. Fox had ut
tered.
Is there not then a coalition in principles atvow

studied in a'few hours, was-a work of a coniidera

the republic with refpefl to the other powers.
Of the war, Dumas fpeke with profefiional know

the highest terms, and was liberal in his
praifeof -those who concerted them, and of those
also who put them in execution. He appreciated
the merit due to the political dexterity of thnfe who
condu&ed our negociatiqns ; and paid a tribute of
applause to our generals, to the 'heroes of the
North and of Italy ; to Buonaparte, to Berthier,
and those who emulate their glory. He exprefied
his wilhes and his hopes for a speedy, wife, and ho

" Soldiers,
" You have iu a forfnight gained Six victories,
taken 21 stand of colours, 71 pieees of cannon, se

Piedmont ; you have made' 15000 prisoners, and
killed or jvounded more than 10,000 men.
" You had hitherto fought only for fterite
Vocks, rendeied illustrious by your courage, buc
useless to the country j you have equalled by your
services the victorious army of Holland and the
Rhine. Deprived of dvery thing, you, have suppli
ed everything, you have won battles without can
non, made forced marches without shoes, watched
without brandy, and often without bread The Re
publican phalanxes, the foldieis of Liberty were
alone capable of fuffering what.you haye fuffered.
" Thanks be to you, Soldiers;the grateful coun
try will, in part be indebted to you-for her pwpfpe
rity ; and if when viCtors at Toulon, you predicted
the immortal campaign of 1794, your nrefetit vie
tories will be the presages of more brilliant victo
ries, The two armies which attacked you wi h
audacity fly difhrartened before you. Men wLo
' failed at your roifsry and rejoicoLlii thought at tie
idea oFthe triumphs of your enemies, are con
founded and appalledâBut it mufl nqt, Soldiers,
be concealed from you, that you have nothing,
since fometliing remains yet to be awe. Neither
Turin nor Milan are in your power. The athesof
the conquerors of the Tarquins are dill disgraced,
by theÂ«fiafliivÂ» of. Bafleville. At the commence
ment of the campaign you werf dellitute of everyt
thing, now you are amply provided ; the magazines
taken from your enemies are numerous, the artille-

" 'Soldiers, the country has a right to expedl
great things from' you { juftify her expeflajions.
The greatest obstacles are undoubtedly overcome, .
but yon have still battles to fight, cities to take,
jivers to pafs.âls there one among you whose
courage it dimiuifhed i Is there one who would
prefer returning to the summits of the Alps ajid

conquerors of Montenotte, Millelimo, Dego, Mon

glory of the French. All wish to humble tile
proud kings who dare to meditate putting us again
in chains j all wish to dictate a peace that shall be
and that shall indemnify the country for
the imtnenfe facrifices which she has made ; all of
you burn with a desire to fay on your return to

" Friends, I promise this eonqueft (o you, but
there is one condition which' you must swear to

to repress the horrid pillage, which some wretches
mitigated by our enemies, praetifed ; tinlefS yoti

Si?.',
Having terminated our miffiiin h<re, by con
cluding a treaty of ptface and fiietidlhip wiih the
Creek nation, we feel it a duty we owe to your ex
cellency, to make this communication to'you ;to
inform you of the pacific difpolition of thfc'Crecks.
They have, among other things,- ({ipulatStl with
us, to carry the treaty of New-Yoik completely
into effect, and !â¢> aid in running the tine, from the
source of the main fork of the Oconee to the Cor*
rahee mountain ; at such time and in such manner,
as the President of the United States (hould difffS;.
The expeditions formed by your Rate relative to
the puS-chafe of certain lands guaranteed to the
Indinns, are frullrate'd. The Representative o{
the Creek nation came inftruScd by the whole na
tion, not to part with the lands. We*rere not ap
prised dt this, 'till our oegociation had been ex
tended to all the objects con'.edted immediately
with our miffiou. We on being informed of it,
thought it our duty, to examine whether any im
proper interference had been used, to produce this
determination of the nation, and we are of opi
nion, after the necessary enquiry, that there was
not aa/fuch iuterfeience, on the part of any of x
the citizens of the United States.
From the long, repeated aad, friendly conven
tions we have had with the chiefs, we have been a
ble to draw from them forae information, which
wc owe to our flotations to give freely td you: It
is, that it will require fomc time, and a confidera*
bit degree of prudence,, to impress on-the Indians,
a confidence in the uprightnefsof the views of your
government, and in the friendly and peaceable inÂ»
tentions of its citizens, who inhabit the frootiecs ;
and until fueh confidence is established, we are of -
opinion, that all attempts to acquire land from them
by fair and open purchase, will be incTFeftual, v
With our bell for the prosperity of the
Hate of Georgia, >
We have the honor to be,
