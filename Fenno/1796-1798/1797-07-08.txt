trC^' r am '^' eommerce and navigation, con
cludedietween his Britannic majesty and the United
States df America, en the 19th day oY November,
1794, hiving this day conftkuted their Board,
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, that they are ready to proceed to
bulinefs accordingly; and they desire that all claims
under the said article (which so far as the fane de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They further desire that all such claims may not
on.y Kate in what manner the several cases come
within the description of the said ertide, but also
fpcciahy set forth ihe nature of the evidence by
which the claimantsrcl'peAively undertake to sub
stantiate the fame.
Extract from the said article,
" Whereas it is alledged by divers Pritifh mer
" chants, and others his majefty't, fubje<sls, that
debtii to a confid'. rabln ampuut, which were bona
" fide contraAed, before the peace, still "remain
" owing to there by citizens or inhabitants of the
nitcd btatcs j and that by the operation of va
" rious lawful impediiiKnt , f Hce tho peace, not
" only the full recovery of the said drhu has been
" delayed, but also the value au4 iecurity thereof
" have been in several instances impaired and less
" ened, so that by tbe ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the British creditors cannot sow
" obtain and actually have and receive full and
" adequate coropenfation for the losses and dama
" ges which tney have thereby fuf:ained: It is a
" greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
" tion for such losses and damages cannot for what
" ever reason be adually obtained, lkad and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinapy "courf?
â¢' of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the lame to the said
" creditors : but it is diftinaly understood, that
" this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by tjie lawful impediments
" afore said, and is not to extend to losses occasion
" ed by such insolvency of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated tp pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not
" cxifted ; nor to such losses or damages as have
" been occasioned by t,he manifeft delay, or nco-li.

I. the Envoy Extrio.'diiniy and M nifter Pleni
potentiary of hia Britannic, Majesty, General Agent
forÂ«fbding British creditors, and such particular a
gents as they may specially authorize, in prosecuting
their claims before the cammiffioners for carrying in
to <!ffeÂ£l the fiwh article lit the Treaty if Amity, Com
merce and Navigation betaeen hit Hritur.nic and
the United States of America, hereby gives nonce thpt
he hps opened his office at his houfc the fbuth ealt
corner of Chefnut and fifth ftreefs, Philadelpjiia,
where he is ready to receive all claims or inltruftirsns
for claiips with the vouchers ami documents thereof,
for the purpose of bringing forward the l.ime agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prescribe.
Ana as it will be for the interctt of all concerned,
that the several claims be so Itatcri, and fupport
td, as 10 prevent the delay which would arise from
the neceffuyof obtaining further imormation, or ad
ditional materials,from perfoÂ»s nfiding at a distance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
direction chiefly-of those, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the prolecutiop of
their claims ta his charge and management) that all
fncf) claims ought in particular to set forthâ
id. The proper description aud fuoation of the
creditor or claimant, eud original debtor, refpec'-
ively.
.id. The date or nature of the original contrafl or
debt. |
3d. When, in what manner, and to what extent, j
the creditor or claimant was prevented or impeded,
by the provision, operation or defect of law, the
decisions and prance of courts, or reflraint of exe- I
cution, from recovering payment of the debt in 1
quefhon. I
4th. The loss and damage incurred or fuflained, I
in consequence of such impediments, whether the 1
fame may have arisen from the infolvenev, change of 1
situation, or death of the debtor, the loss of legal ,
remedy from laple of time, or ethercaufes impairing
the value and focurity of the debt, which would not
have so operated if such impediments-had not existed.
And sth. The particular grounds and reasons on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the 1
treaty, that "by the ordinary course of judicial pro- '
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and aftually .
have and Teceive full ar.d adequate compensation" for
the losses aod damages so fufialUed,
The (pneral agent thinks it his duty farther to fog
ged that the several claims ought to be accompanied "
and supported by the affidavits of -the claimants duly
sworn and regularly attefled, both as to the exiflence
of the debts claimed, aod such other circumstances
as may be within tbeir own knowledge refpeftively.
And wherever the claimants in slating the nature of
their evidence (which mull in everv inflance be the
best of which the cafe is capable) have occafton to
refer to the teftimonv of witnelfes, it will -be proper
to apprise the general agent of the names and places
of residence of such witnesses and the fa&tto be elta

MORGAN J. RHEES;
No. 77, bouth Second-lirect, Philadelphia.
The pnrchafers eflotsin Beula have the following
piefpeiftsof appreciating their property :
I. it is remote trom any other town, and fur
reuaded by great bodies ot excellent land, capable
ol producing every kind of grain and vegetables,
and is without doubt one ef tlie bcU grazing coun
tries in the United States.
1. In point of health the situation is not exceed- 1
ed by any on the continent.
3. Belides numerous Iprings and runs, of the fin
eft quality, there is a creek for wafer works (on
which nulls are now building) running through the
tswn,
4. The public road from Philadelphia to Pitts
burgh will go through It, which being more level
and nearer than any other rout, must become uni
versally travelled : aided by the navigation of Ju
niata and Conemaugh, goods may be conveydd at
least J or 3 dollars per cwt. cheaper from the lor
mer to the latter place, tKan by the old road thro'
Bedford.
J. Being in the centre of a fWurifliing settle
ment, and taking in the Ihprtett portage between
the eastern and western waters, it is likely to be
come a deposit forftores, a manufacturing town,
and a feat of justice. Besides the old fettlsrs, up
wards of one hundred emigrants have fettled in the
viciHity of Beula, since last OSober, and many
more have engaged to join them this summer.
6. A Land-Office for supplying adual settlers
with farms to a considerable amoui.t, and in vari
ous situations, will be immediately opened in the
town. The proprietors of land in the circumja
cent country are f.licited to fend their drafts and
terms of sale, or leaiing, to Thomas Jones, Sur
veyor, in Beula, who will give.security fpr any
trust reposed in him : with such co-operating aid,
the progress of the settlement will be the more ra
pidly advanced and extended to distant townlhips.
7. A public library for the benefit of the settlers,
will be ellablifhed in the town, towards laying the
foundation of which, upwards of one thousand
volumes are already pur chafed and principally sent
8. Iwo hundred acres of land adjoining the
town, besides lots and fubferiptions, will be applied
to support a minister and preceptor, capable of
teaching the ufeful and liberal arts.
9. After defraying ijeceffary expences, the mo
ney arising from the present sales will be laid out ia
public buildings.âA place of worship, school
houfcand library room, are the firft obje&s.
IÂ®. Every profeffiotial man and mechanic, on
condition ot building a houfc with a stone or biick
chimney, and residing in it, before the firft of No
vember next, will be entitled to four lots gratis,
free forever from ground rent. Five apd ten acre
out lots may likewise be obtained 00 rcafonable
terms.
The two central streets in Beula are ico

Tuesda?, July 4.
The House met this morning at nine
ti'clock. , - â Â»
Thfc liill allowing an additional mileage
to the members of both hotifes } thf bill
confuls and vice-iconfuls, and the
bill making additional appropriations for
the year 1 "797, were read the third and
parted.
Mr. called up the resolution
he ye ft.;rday laid Â«pon the' table, for laying
an additional duty on fait.
Mr, Gallatin moved to postpone the
the consideration of thispropofition until the
second Monday in November.
Some debate tools'place oq this question ;
and, when it came to be taken, the house
was equally divided, there being 43 votes
Votes for the postponement atld 43 against
it, The Speaker decided agajnft the post
ponement, and the resolution was referred
to a committee of the whole and made the
order for to-morrow. /
The house accordingly resolved itfelf into
a committee of the whole on this resolution ;
when
Mr. Allen moved the blank cents per
bushel, be filled with twelve.
Mr. SkjjrANwicK wilhed the sum to be
seven.
s*, Mr. Allen consented to make it eight.
Mr. Sitgkeaves, hoped it would be
twelve. .
The question was firft taken upon twelve
and negatived, there being only 30 votes for
it* It was next taken upon eight and a
greed to 47 to 42, and then upon the reso
lution as amended, and carried by the fame
number.
The committee rose, and the house took
up the resolution.' After a few words from
Mr. Lyon against the tax, and from Mr.
Williams in favor of it, Mr. W. Smith
went at considerable length into a defence
of the measure, in the course of which, he
said, they had already agreed upon appro
priations to the amount of 7 or 80c,OOO
dollars, jjnd weve not certain of any revenue
to meet the expenditure. The licence adt
he believed might produce from 50 to 60
thousand dollars, and the stamp aft from
100 to 150,00Â© dollars, if they (hould.be
palfed, but; he considered this as doubtful.
But if these laws were parted, this tax on
fait was neceflary ro keep up the equilibri
um of taxation > for the stamp aft would
almost exclusively fall upon commerce and
large cities, this would be principally felt
by the Agricultural part of the Union ; and
if it were not agreed to, they must have a
land tax. . , .
Mr. Shepard said no tax would operate
so equally as a fait tax, as every citizen must
make use of it in a smaller or larger quantity.
Mr. Gallatin opposed this tax on the
fame ground which he heretofore opposed
it, as opprefiive to certain parts of the U
nion, and .no way affedting others, and
therefore wholly unequal, and particularly
as it bore heavy upon the poorer clafles of
society. He was against it also, because
it was not proposed that the amount of this
tax (hould go towards a reduction of the
public debt, butmerelyto encourageexpence
in the government; for he believed if they
filled the treasury with money, means would
be found to expend it. Indeed, if the trea
sury had not been at present in rather a low
state, he believed they (hould have gone in
' to most of the expensive measures proposed
to them thi's feflion. He allowed the
tax would be produdtive, as a tax upon
bread, air, or any neceflary of Use, must be
produ&ive. If this tax were, however .to
â¢be.agreed to, he (hould wish to make an a
mendment to the present proportion At
present the drawback allowed to the New-
England states, on account of the fait used
in the fifheries, amounted to 90,000 dollars
a year, though by the ftatementit appeared
there (hould only have been allowed 50,000.
To rectify this, he proposed the following
proviso to be added to the resolution, viz.
" Provided that the allowance now given u
pon veflels employed in filheries, (hall not be
increased-"
This amendment was opposed by Mr.
Harper, Mr. Sewall, Mr. Dana and Mr.
Kittera. on the ground of its being an un
fair way of introducing the proportion, as
no one expedted it, they were not prepared
to meet it, the corredtnefs of the statement
was doubted ; and if it were corredt, it was
said, the proper.way of doing the business
would not be to pass the present law with
out a drawback, but to reduce the former
drawback and make it less on this occasion.
The motion was supported by the mover,
and Meflrs. Venable and Livingfton ; but,
after some difcuflion, Mr. G. withdrew it,
in order to give gentlemen time to make
themselves acquainted with the fahe had
stated ; but he exprefled his intention of re
newing the proportion when thebillcame in.
The question then returned upon the ori
ginal resolution ; when '
Mr. Harper went at length into a de
fence of the measure, (in the course of which
he charged Mr. Gallatin with being mista
ken by 12,000 dollars as to the amount of
the drawback allowed) and infilled that it
, was a fair and proper tax andthat so small an
advance upon the present duty could not o
perate oppressively upon any class of the
community.
Mr. Nicholas followed in opposition.
He dwelt considerably on the unjust and un
equal manner in which this tax would ope
rate. He said he did not view this queftion
a i deciding merely whether an additional tax
of eight cents (hould be laid upon fait ; but
whether that neceflary of life (hould be cal
led up for every thing government (hould
want, He was in favour of a dire A tax
which (hould fall equally, though it might,
in the origin, be attended with some cpnfi
- derable expencebut, If they went on rai
ling partial sums in this way by indirect
means, the cxpence of instituting a direst
tax would always be an obstacle, and indi
rect taxea would eonftatitly be had recourse
to. He did not believe it to be absolutely
'neceflary to provide a revenue this feflion,
as he believed money mighf as well be bor
rowed without as with additional revenue,
and next feflion the fuhjedt could be fully
gone into,
My. Lyon spoke ps the difepntent which
had always been (hewn in 'the part of the
country from to'hertce he came, whifch he
said, would be greatly increased by this ad
\ dition. It was not only a duty of eight
cents ; every cent would be made four,
before the fait reached them. There was no
kind of tax which his constituents would not
foonerbear. It had been said that a land
tax would cost 25 per cent, to colledt it, but
what was 25 per cent, compared with 300
per cent ! Nor did he believe this tax would
prevent a land tax ; he believed they (hould
go on taxing the people until they would
be greatly diflatisfied. He Would much
rather a tax of eight cents was laid upon tea,
which would produce an equal sum.

After the firft call was fini(hed, Mr.
Blount came in and said he was called out to
the door, and from the noise without doors,
he had not heard his lyime called. His
vote being refufed to be admitted he said he
(hould then call the yeas and nays on the
palling of bill.
A committee was appointed to report a
bill in pursuance of thyi resolution. A mo
tion was now made (about half past twelve)
to adjourn. Adjourned till 9 to-morrow.
Wednesday, July 5.
A bill was reported for laying a duty up
on fait, which was twice read, and ordered
to be committed this day, after a motion
was loft for postponing it till the second
Monday in November, 39 to 33.
Mr. W. Smith called the order ofthe
day on the bill authorising a loan of mo
ney.
The House went into a committee of the
whole on the fubjedt, when
Mr. W. Smith moved to fill the blank
in which was to be inserted the money to be
borrowed, with 800,000 dollars, which, he
said, was about the amount of the appro
priations of the present feflion.
Mr. Gallatin said it perhaps was net
very material as to the exadt sum V'ith
which this blank. was filled ; but the ap
propriations of this feflion did not amount
to that fnm. 150,000 dollars had been- ap
propriated for the fortifications, and the a
mount of the appropriation bill was 567;
000, which did not make quite 700,000
dollars, and there* would certainly be a con
siderable overplus of revenue to meet in
part this expense.
Mr. Harper did not believe there would
be much overplus of revenue ; there wouÃl
be some, but it could not be said how mijch,
as there would doubtl<;fs be considerable de
falcations, from the inability of merchants
to pay their bonds. He did not think the
blank (hould be filled with a less sum than
800,000 dollars.
Mr. W. Smith said, besides the two
items mentioned by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, there was 10 or 15,000 dol
lars appropriated for agents under the Brj
ti(h treaty. There was also another article
wfeich might be agreed to in the course of
the feflion, which /hould be included in the
loan. There could be no inconvenience
from giving authority to borrow a larger
film than required, as it would be drawn
only as it was wanted, and the interest to
be charged only from the time the money
was got. The surplus Â«f revenue, as his
colleague had stated, was very precarious,
600,000 dollars might be fufficient; but of
that there was no certainty.
Mr. Gallatin did not know why gen
tlemen should wish to increase this sum be
yond the appropriations of this feflion, â¢
there was already authority in the commis
sioners of the finking fund to borrow more
money than they could get. He believed
the of revenue would be fufficient;
as last year there was an increase of 700,000
dollars. And- this year there would not
be a less sum. He wished to have the blank
filled with the amount of the appropriations,
viz. 697,000 dollaars,
Mr. W1 lliams was in favor ofthe lar
ger sum.
The queftion-for filling the blank with
800,000 dollars was put and carried 43 to
34- 1 '
The committee fofe, and the bill tvas or
dered to be engrofled for a third reading
this day, which it afterwards received and
pafled.
The house went into ? committee on the
bill for laying an additional duty on fait ;
wlien â¢ â¢Â»
Mr. Gallatin moved to strike out all
that related to the allowing of,a drawback
to veflels employed in the lifting trade, on
the ground which,he yesterday stated, vjz.
that the allowance at present made was too
large by 40,000 dollars a year, taikihg the
year J 794 for his data ; butjt appeared
that, in the year 1795, there was a deficien- ;
cy in that, trade, owing principally, it was
supposed, to the great demand for seamen
in the merchants service ; he therefore
would take the calculation of the gentleman
from S. Carolina (Mr. Harper) made yes
terday, And niftead of calling the amount
of drmfrbick allowed 90,000 he would state
it to be '78,000, and even then he said, the
drawback at present allowed would exceed
20,000 dollars, the drawback to which they
would be entitled, if the present duty took
place. He spoke jp:nerally against the tax
as oppreflive to the .back country ; but if
the gentleman from Mafiachufetts and oth
ers, were determined to mcreafe the tax,
he (hould wi(h their part of the country tcr
pay their lhare of it.
' This motion was supported by Meffr9.
Venable,. Nicholas, Clay, M'Dowell and
Macon.
It was oppofed4>y Messrs. Sewall, Otis,
Harper, Coit, Brookes, Kittera, J. Wil
liams and The calculation of the
quantity of fait estimated to he necessary to
| be used sot ar quintal of fi(h, was said to be
stated too low (one buftiel), that the sum
allosfed, was not qnly meant as a draw
back of the duty, but also ai a bouuty on
the filhing trade, as being a nursery for sea
men, and serving as a kind'of naval militia
for the United States? If it appear,
however, that the present allowance was
too great (which, by some gentlemen in fa
vor of this iriotfon, which was in blank,
seemed t<i be acknowledged) a less allowance
might be made in this bill ; but they could
not consent to the bill pafling without a
drawback.
The question for striking out the clause
was taken, and negatived 49 to 41;
Mr. Coit moved to fill the blank with
50 per cent, infteadof 66 2-3<is, which was
the drawback allowed by the present law.
Mr. Hartley thought this sum too
h ('g h -
Mr. Williams moved 33 1 -3d per cent,
which was carried without a division.
Mr. Nicholas moved a limitation clause,
to continue the aft in force for two vears,
and from thence to the end of the next fef
iion of Congress.
This motion, after , some conversation
upon it, was carried 42 to 39.
The committee rose, and the house a

A bill was received from the Senate for
continuing in force an aft to revive and con

states, which was read the ift, 2dtmd 3d
time and passed.
Mr. Reed reported two bills as duly en

vice consuls, and the bill allowing addition

which were accordingly signed by the speak
er.
A message from the President of thg U

this report was made and difeuffed, but also
the former confidential business, which we
understand to relate to Algerine './ airs.
Adjourned till i o o'clock to-morrow.
THURSDAY, JULY 6.
Mr. Swanwick presented a memorial,
signed by twenty-nine merchants of this ci
ty, against the pafling of the stamp aft.â
Mr. S. said he knew this memorial was too
late to have any effeft, but, otiV of refpeft
to the petitioners, he'wifhed it to be receiv
ed at)d lie upon the table.
The stamp aft was yesterday passed by
the Senate.
The bill making further appropriations
for the year 1797, wis received from the
Senate, with an amendment propofmg to
add a clause to it of 45,000 dollars 011 ac
count of our treaties with the Mediterranean
powers. It was referred t6 the committee
of the whole, to whom was referred the con
fidential communication of the President
with refpeftto Algerine business.
Mr. Sitgreaves, from the committee to
whom was referred the confidential commu
nication of Monday last, reported the fol
lowing resolution, viz.
" Resolved, that William Blount, a Sena
tor of the United States, from the state of
Teneffee, be impeached for high crimes and
misdemeanors."
This resolution was twice read, and com
mitted for this day.
A motion was made by Mr. W. Smith,
for going immediately into a committee of
the whole on this business'; but it was with
drawn, in order to take up the amendments
of the Senate to the bill laying additional
licenses oif'the retailing'of foreign wines and
spirits.
The principal amendments of the Senate
were to extend the licenses to domestic wines
and spirits, as well as to those of foreign
manufacture.
The amendments of the Senate were fup
portedby Messrs. J. Williams," Sewall, Skin
ner and Varnum, on the ground of making
the duty fall more equally ; as, at present,
it was asserted, that some states paid far
more than others. Mr. Williams, in parti
cular, asserted, that the state of New-York
paid one-fifth of the whole.
The amendments were opposed by Messrs.
Gallatin, Hartley, Kittera, Venable, Day
ton, Dennis, Coit, and Craik, as oppreflive
to the frfiall farmers of this country, who
had just been taxed by an additional duty on
fait, and as tending to destroy all those small
distilleries who distilled for sale from jo to
20 gallons a year.
After considerable difcuflion, a motion
was made for the committee to rife, which
was carried by the calling vote of the chair
man (Mr. Dent). And on leave being ask
ed for the committee to fit again, it was rc
fufed 52 to 31.
The farther consideration of the fubjeft
was then postponed till the 2d Monday in
November.
Mr. Reed reported, that the bill for lay
ing a stamp duty, and that to revive and
continue in force, fer a limitted time, an aft
authorising the transfer of the stock ftand l ing
to the credit of certain states, were duly en
rolled.
Mr. Sfrigg presented a memorial from
major Lewis, extra aid-du-camp to general
Wayne, for pay for his services in that ca
pacity. After some opposition it' was re
ferred to a feleft committee to report by
bill or otherwise ; and, before the house
rose, a bill was reported, and committed for
to-morrow.
On motion of Mr. Sjtgreaves, ' the
hqufe resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole on the resolution reported for im
peaching William Blount ; when,
Mr. Sitgreaves said, if there were no
objections to the proposition, he hoped' the
committee would rife and report it ; or, if
any information {hould be wanted on the
fubjeft, he should endeavour to give the
committee all that he had in his power to
give.
Mr. Skinner said he had doubts in his
mind whether the house had any right to
interfere in the business.
Mr. Sitgreaves obferved,that when the
communication was firft made to the Presi
dent of the United States, it appeared so
evident to him that the occasion called for
some aftive steps being taken, that he im
mediately took the opinions of the attorney
genei'nl, Mr. Rawle, and Mr. Lewis, to
whom he proposed certain questions. A co
py of the opinion which they returned to
him had been tranfihitted to the committee.
It stated that the above gentlemen had con
iidered the letter of William Blount, and
the fever&l questions proposed thereon, and
answered,
1. That the letter is evidence of a crirtie.
2. That the crime was of the denomina
tion of -a misdemeanor.
3. That William Blount being-a Senator
is liable to impeachment for the said crime
before the Senate. ,
It was in conformity to this opinion, that
the President of the United States thought
himfelf bound to aommu'nicate the letter to
the house of Representatives, and leave it
for them to aft upon the occasion. If the
opinion of these high law charafters was
correft, there could be no doiibt of the part
which they ought to take. For his own
part, he had not been able to fee why-the
members of the Senate were not as fair ob
jefts of impeachment as any other officers of
government. He believed, upon a candid
review of the conftitutiou, it would be seen
that there was no reftriftion upon the right
of impeachment. There was a reftriftion
upon the to be inflifted, but
not upon the right. He would not pretend
to fay the right might not, however, be cir
cumscribed in some refpefts. He believed
a Senator could not be impeached for any
thing he might do as a legiftator; though
this (hould be understood with limitation;
for, if corruption colild be proved upon
him, it would be a.fair'ground of impeach
merit, though, acting in the ordinary course
oFlegifbtion, hr could not be called to ac
count ffir his conduft out of the house.
He believed, that in a government like
ours, t\ie right of impeachment was a very
valuable right. It was a fort of process cal
culated to reach state offenders, not other
wise amenable to punishment ; and there was
no fear that in this country this power should
be abused, as in another coujitry, to serve
the purposes of a minister or a party, as
both the body which mates the accusations,
and the court which decides upon the charge,
are the real representatives of the people,
the one immediately, and the other medi
ately.
In England, Mr. S. said, this trial by
impeachment had been carried beyond offi
cial cases. He instanced the famous trial
of doftor Sacheyerell, who was impeached
for preaching a h'hetfous fcrmon. It was
well known that this cause divided the king
dom, and that the firil talents were called in
to the aid of the doftor.
The Senate, Mr. S.\faid, W3S peculiarly
conftrufted. Its powers were of a compli
cated nature : they were legislative, execu
tive and judicial. In -confcquence of their
executive powers, they had poffeflion of all
the secrets of the Executive. The officer
who was charged -in this cafe, he said, had
particular relation to this part of the func
tions of the Senate ; for, having this parti
pation in the secrets of government, it was a
particular breach of official duty, when a
Senator attempted to seduce an officer of the
United States from his duty. -
So also when a Senator of the United
States (hail endeavor to deprive the govern
ment of this country, or its agents, of the
confidence of a foreign nation ; when he
ft all endeavor, by fedu&ive arts, to lead a
foreign nation to make hoftiUties on this
country, it was certainly such a violation
of his duty as would warrant an impeach
ment. Mr. S. said these were the confidera
tionÃ which had induced the committee ta
make the report they had made ; it was for
the house to aft upon it as they saw proper.
Mr. Nicholas had his doubts with re
fpedt to the constitutional right of the house
on this fuhjeft. He thought the committee
had neglected something which ought to
have been done. They ought to have had
some fatisfa&ion with respect to the truth
of .the charge ; they were not to aft upon
mere suspicion. This was his firft impref
lion on the fubjeft ; but Jte had yet made
little enquiry on the matter'; he thought,
however, before they declared a man in any
degree guilty, they should have evidence be
fore them.
It did not appear to him that a member
of the legislature could be termed an officer
of government, for so far as a Senator had to
do with the Executive, his charafter was
merely that of an adviser, and he doubted,
therefore, whether he could, in .giving his
opinion, be liable to prosecution ; nor did
he think his crime of corrupting an officer
was the greater because he wa6 a Senator.
(To be continued,)
The report of the Committee of th? Se
nate refpefting the expulsion of Mr. Blount
was difcufled. MefFrs. Dallas and Ingerfol
attended as his Counsel. Meantime the
House of Representatives hat} pasTed a reso
lution to impeach him of'high criir.eis and
misdemeanors. The members of the House
appeared on the floor of the Senate, when
Mr. Sitgreaves at the Bar of the-Senate,\id
dreffed the PrefideMt in the name of the
Representatives, and of the People of. the
United States, impgached William JBlount,
a member of the Senate, and demanded that
his feat be fequ?ftered. A resolution was
moved by Mr. Sedgwick, agreeably to this
denjand âalso that he be taken' into custody
by the meflenger, until he give surety him
felf in 2o;ooo dollars and two securities in
15,000 dollars each.
After some debate, the firft part of the

Daring the late canvass for the eleSion of a

Mr. Hamilton would be an advifcable candidate.
A person in this city who evinced to fee thiÂ« newf

Mr. Hamilton's way, and inform him that if

on that head, the papers referred to were intlautly
to be laid before the world. â¢ Tie mefagt -was deliv
ered to Afr. Hamilton and the Minerva became Jllent"
I have also, fyice, seen the pamphlet, No. V.
mentioned in the advertisement.
I think it proper to take an early opportunity
to declare, that the anecdote ftatcd in the above pa
ragraph is wholly falfe, and that 1 never received
any such istimation as is thereby pretended from
any person whatever. As to the papeFs contained
in (he pamphlet, from a cursory perifal, I take
them to be authentic. But the solution of them is
limply thisâThry were the contrivance of two of
the mofl profligate men in the world to obtain
their liberation frÂ»m imprii'onment for a serious
crime by the favor of party fiirit. For this purpose
recourle was had to Meflrs. James Monro,,Senator,
Frederick A. Muhlenbergh, Speaker, and Abraham Ve
nabtc, a Member of the House bf Representatives,
two of these gentlemen my known political opponent,'.
A full explanation took place between thera and
myfelf in the presence of Oliver tVokoU, jun. Esq.
theprefent Secretary of the l'reafury, in which by
â written documents 1 convinced them of the falfhood
( 'f the accuiationâThey dedartd themselves per
fectly fatislied with the explanation, and exprelfed
their rtgret at the neceflity which had been occa
sioned to me of making it. It it my intention
shortly to place the fubjeS more precisely before
the public.

The French faction have exulted in the inftauce
of one fappofed attempt on the part of the British
government to intrigue among our citizens. By

Mr. Lift on did not begin the istngun; the vile and
treafonablc measure was profiojed to him.âBe that
f<i& as it may, h is obfepvabla that whenever fo
reigners wish to carry on any unjuftifiable projods
in this country, they know-who to apply ts ; they
1 know what men " have their prices 5" they are
furc of not meeting a rebuff among the bawling ex

Meflrs. Gallatin, Nicholas, Ik. yesterday in the
House of Reprefentativcs wilhed to have the ques
tion of impeaching their fiiend postponed until
next feflion ; they wished the public attention tote
diverted from the offender to the offence, and British
bribery.' Four months would have given them op
portunity to conjure up some method of screening
Mr. Blount, and of raising a cry against what they
call a British fa&ion ; but their arts'will fail them
Once. Americans will not forget that the traitor is
of the democratic party ; that he has uniformly voted
-with the jacobin* in Co^refs; and that he has been
hind in glove with Mr. Adet, and the Spanish Min

men who, while they set up claims to lingular vir

MR. FENNO,
IF we were to argue from the conduit of the
jacobins on former occalions, it would seem, that
the mere aÂ»st of turning four merchant, was consid
ered by t>iem as perfectly innocent, if not merito
rious When Randolph, for inflanca, foldfour to
JFauchet, the dens of the patriots refoundrd with
the doleful exclamation of poor Randolph ! Alas !
poor Randolph! he has fallen a vi&im to his ill
judged confidence in the President. Pray, geod
people, did the President advise this honell unfuf
peiVing Randolph to pocket fifty thousand dollars
of the public money, and then betray him ? An
swer me that question. AgainâWhenOenet, in
the year 179.3, commiflioned a number oi 'flour
merchants, some to cruize against the fubje&s of
Great Britain, and others to invade the territories
of the tyrant of Spain, as the very men who now
dine with his minister then styled him ; âwe hearS
nothing about the expediency of fending Genet
back to his employes. If, then, according to the
jacobins, there is no harm in felling flour to, the
French, how happens it that the vile crew makes
such a clamor about Mr. Blount's contraA ? Being
somewhat puzzled at this nice diltindion, I appli
ed tÂ® one of the society for an explanationâWhy,
Sir, said h<, are you so ignerant as not to know,
that in the one cafe it was lawful, and in the other
treafonablcâTi.c French are our good and faith
ful allies, but as to the English, they are our most
inveterate enemies ; and betides,there is more dan
ger to be apprehended from British than from
French influenceâA few thousand dollars will go but
a little way towards building chapels, paying old
debts, becoming security for leather contractors,
&c. &c. Whereas some thousand guineas might, by
-ridding a patriot of all his embarrassments, make
an honclt man of him But how do you, replied
I, account for the fcandaToui treatment we are dai
ly receiving from our good and faithful allies ? That
to be fyre at firft fight, rejoined he, appears rather
mylleriousâit is capable, however, of explanation ;
but; as We are all sworn to secrecy, you null ad

provided for their own fafety: which we
( doubt not but the-United-States Will acquiesce
; to in confequedce of the treaty and the good
, harmony that, fubiifta between the United

The said commander general of this pro

putting in a (late of defence several points ;
j of this river, and particularly Nogalft, to j
coyer lower Louisiana, and in cife the ;

Sir, *
YOUK letter of yesterday was delivered me
by your Adjutant Captain Stephen Minor, iihe
Governor General has, as appears from your let
ter to me requeued that I ihould be informed of
a propr.fed attack on your part of the Illinois
thr-Bi itifh force of Canada, and that
.such an expedition cannot take place without
parting through the territory of. tbe United,
States' 1 have not a doubt but that t+.e U'r.ited

csre to them.the refpe# due.the Nation, and
that at the time every preparation ms b- Ln
made to carry into cffcÂ£t with firmnei's the late
. treaty between his Catholic Majesty and the
United State*.
The second part of your letter more particu
larly concerns me, as a longer delay of the eva
cuation of the Walnut-Hills and Natchez, lean
not ..onfider in any other light than an indirect
violation'of the late treaty.
The landing of any troops for the pnrpofe of
fortifying or re-inforcing Nogalls, or any oilier
port above a due east and well line to be drawn
33, and 46, foutlvfrom Mr. Ellicort'* prefect
encampment, will be highly improper, ami no
doubt considered as a direct attack upon the Ho
nnr of the United States, is well as the liberties
ess the citizens, and an invasion of 1 part of our
tenltory ; there being no war between the Unit
ed Starts and Great Britain, the latter poVt-r
would have every reason of" complaint (hunld
a measure be fpffered. - I now proceed to
the third and last part of your letter, and carinot

Sir, v'
YESTERDAY, by' Lieutenant John M'
Clairy, 1 received .your answer to my, com
munication of the day before. I am forty to
find life conftruflion you. give to such an
official information, >Vhith leaves no room of
doubt.
The Projtjdl of an attack from the Britifil
in Canada, is Prffitive. and in consequence
thereof, it is the duty of the Commander
General of Provin-'e to oppose it by
avery means in his power, iho' tie piobabi
lity is, that they will not be able to catty
their plan into execution as we rely on the
friendlhip of the United State?, who certain
ly will not voluntarily permit fnch an armed
force to paffc through their territory, to attack
the dominions of his Majesty ; but, when such
an expedition was proposed, the British knew
very wellihat to aceomplifh it they must
necessarily pass through the territory ef' the
United States, they certainly have had it in J
view either to pass the Pods by surprise, or
fonne other combination that secured to them
the means of reaching Illinois : it.is to pre
vent the efFefts of such an event that the said
Commander General takes every measure to
obftruft their success at their firft approach,
or a continuation of it, if fortune IhJuld favour
them in Upper Louiflana.
We are far from adting in a manner fa as
to alter the good understanding that happily
fubGfts between our nations. Political rea
lons have canfed a fufpenlton of the evacuati
on of these Pods ; reasons that are to be fet
tled minillerialfy, and that are out of my line
to controvert, my duty is to comply with the
superior orders of my General in Chief,
which are pofitivefy to keep the bed harmo
ny with you, and attend to every other ob
jeft concerning'the fafety of this Province. '
There is no reason to apprehend that the
treaty between she United States of Amer
ica and his majesty 6>ill not take place in ev
erypoint ; the delay experienced with re.
gardto one part of it, is not a violation of j
the treaty, and is only referred to the regu
lar ministerial procedure, which, when fet
tled, will be exa&iv complied with ; in the
mean while, no alteration can take place,
nor can any part ofhis majesty's dominions
be considered alienated, delivered in a so
lemn and regulai* manner, aad until that pe
riod the dominion of his majesty does not 1
cease.
The communication that the commander
general of the province has ordered me to ;
impart to you, is a striking proof of the good i
understanding that he.iS to cultivate, !
by informing'you of -an important circum
stance that can'eerns both our nations, with
out expedting that you would offer any ob
jections to the indispensable dispositions that
he finds neeeflary for' the fafety of the pro
vince. |
As your answer is of a nature that re- 1
quires- the immediate communication of it to

me further, if y6u have positive orders to
make the objeflions that you "have fignifiedj
to me, as it mult necessarily influence the j
