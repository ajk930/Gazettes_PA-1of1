our Treaty with Spain, that the running
Bnd marking of the Boundary Line between
the Colonies of Ealt and Welt Florida, and
the Territory of the United States, haVe â 
been delayed by the Officers of his Catholic !
Majesty, and that they have declared their
intention to maintain his jurifdidtion, and to '
suspend tile withdrawing histroops fromthe 1
Military posts they occupy within the terri- '
tory of the United States, until the two
Governments (hall, by negociation, have 1
fettled th; meaning of the 2d article refpedt- '
ing the withdrawing of the troops, garri- '
â¢fans, or settlements of either party in the '
territory of the 1 other; that is, whether :
when the Spanish garrisons withdraw, they
are to leave the works Handing or to demo
lish them, and until, by an additional article 1
to the 1 rcaty, the real property of the in- 1
habitants shall be fee u red, and likewise until '
the Spanish Officers are sure the Indians will
be pac:Sc. The two firft questions, if to be '
determined by negociation, might be made
lubjsdts of diicufljon for years, and as no li- 1
rotation of time can be prescribed to the
Other, a certainty in the opinion of the '
Spanish Officers, that the Indians will be !
pacific, it will be impossible to fuffer it to re%
main an cbftacle to the fulfilment of the
Treaty on the part of Spain. ]
To remove the firft difficulty, I have de- j
termined to leave it to the discretion of the
Officer's of his Catholic Majesty, when they
withdraw his troops from within the terri
tory of the United States, either to leave
the works standing, or to demolish them.â
And to remove the second, I shall cause an
assurance to be published, and to be particu
larly communicated to the Minister of his
Catholic Majesty, and to the Governor of
Louisiana, that the settlers or occupants of
the lands in question, shall not be disturbed
in their possessions by the troops of the Uni
ted States ; but, on the contrary, that they
shall be protedted in all tneir lawful claims,
and to prevent every doubt on this point, it
merits the consideration of Congress, whe
ther it will not be expedient immediately to
pass a law, giving positive afTurances to those
inhabitants who by fair and regular grants,
or by occupancy, have obtained legal titles
or equitable claims to lands in that country,
prior to the final ratification of the Treaty
between the United States and Spain, on
rhe 25th of April, 1796.
This country is rendered peculiarly'valu
able by its inhabitants, who are represented
to amount to nearly four thousand, gene
rally well affedted and much attached to the
United States, and zealous for the establish
ment of a government under their authority.
I therefore recommend to your considera
tion, the expediency of eredting a govern
ment in the Diftridt of the Natchez, similar
to that established for the territory North-
Weft of the River Ohio, but with certain
modifications relative to titles or claims of
land, whether of individuals or companies,
or to claims of jurisdiction of any indivi
dual State.

Our letters from ViennaÂ» dated the illh
inft. (late as follow :
The unf rtunate situation ef this capital and
of our affairs is daily encreafing, the Areh
duke Charles hns, found himfelf obliged
by the great Superiority of the French to re
treat behind Bruck on the Murr, in Styria,
about 16 or 18 miles diltant frotn that place.
The Republicans have taken pofTt ffi >ll of
Klagerifurthj and according to a prevailing
report, even of Graetz the capital of Styria
Tliey pdifuethe Archduke veryjclofel) . The
in habitaints of this city have offered to oc
cupy and defend tbe lines near Vienna, and
all their fcrvant snd other people they employ
ire to march against the enemy, under the
orders of the Prince of Wirtembergli, late
Governor of Graetz. In order to preveut
the Trench from rendering themselves ma
de rS of the Dsnube, a camp of 12,000 men
is to be formed near Lintz. The English
and Ruffian Envoys make the neeeffary pre
parationt for quitting this capital in cafe of
need. The empress, the archdukes, &c. are to
proceed eithei to Olmutz Wto Prague, whi
ther the Archives, precious effedts, &c. are
likewise feot.- Some French spies were lately
arrested at a small diltance from. Vienna
In Tyrol affairs have suddenly taken a
better turn. Tb?AuftriÂ»ns reentered Botzen
on the 4th inft aud Btixen on the 6th. The
French are every where retreating in Tyrol
to join their.troops in Carinthia and Styria.
But this retrograde movement may perhaps
also be occasioned by the great armaments in
Tyro', where 40,000 peafents are under arms;
fothat it might be possible to cut oft" Buona
parte's army, if it were not too strong.
"Meanwhile, proposals of an artoiAice have
been made to Buonaparte, which be has how
ever rejected, declaring at the fame time that
J>? was only authorized to conclude a peace.
H's proposals were however too humiliating
for the House of Austria, and were corvfe
quenily rejeflcd; but at the fame time coun
terpropofjtions were traafmitted to Buonspar
te, whofc ar.fwcr i* not yet arrived."
LONDON, April 17
Admiral Gravina is arrived at Cadiz, to
take the command of the Spamfli Â£c;t, â 1
which was to fail about the 3d in 11. 1
Buonaparte is marching to Vienna with
out meeting with any ebltacles in his \v?.y, 1
and there is no army which can* chock his c
progress. He fays in a letter of the 3d in- t
ftant, that he was thin 28 leagues difUnt 1
from Vienna, where he hoped to arrive oft ;
the 9th. :
The king of Sweden has permitted all <
forts of grain to be exported from Sweden, t
Letters from the frontiers of Suabia, of 1
the 2d inft. mention a contribution having j
been laid by the French 011 the town of Bot- J
Zen, of three, an J, according to others, of ]
fourmillions of livres. 1
From the Completion of several popular <
Meetings, one should fuppofc that their ob- !
jedt was rather confufion than peace. The >
language held on these occafiion has been <
better calculated to procrastinate the desire- '
able event, than accelerate its conclusion ; ;
it is rather inviting the enemy to hold out
exorbitant terms, than to propose such as
are likely to procure a lasting peace, which
is the avowed, though not the true object
of some of these Meetings. We are perfua- 1
ded that many gentlemen who give their â 
fandtion to them, do so from the best and :
purest motive; but they are not aware per- '
haps, that to force Petitions of this "fort on '
his Majesty, especially pending a negocia- < '
tion, must tend to give confidence to the e- 1
nemy, while it weakens the energy of our '
own Government. 1
The Vengeur privateer, lately taken from
the French by the Vestal frigate, is fuppo- 1
fed to have made more captures than any 1
ship during the war.
The Batavian Convention have, appointed â

Letters from Rio de Janeiro, of the 24th
Odt. 2, state French frigates and a brig to 1
have been cruizing off that coaff, and to 1
have captured One English and several Por- j
tuguefe vessels.
On Saturday seven foreigners, Appre- â 
hended at a gaming-house, in Panton
ftreet, were examined at Bow-street. Sever- |
al persons appeared to the charadter of four j
of them, who were in confequenceliberated; j
two others were ordered to remain in cufto- '
dy, till some persons of refpedtability should ;
vouch for their good condudt; and the se
venth was ordered to leave the kingdom, un
der the provisions of the Alien Bill.
The great Tunnel of the Worcefterand
Birmingham Canal is finifhed; it is upwards
of a mile and a half in length; vessels

In the Sitting of the Council of Five
Hundred the Bth inft. Delarue denounced
the atrocities which the Jacobins, headed
by the Commissaries of the Directory, had
committed in order to drive the good Citi
zens out of the Primary Assemblies. This
denunication was followed by a very violent
debate; at the close of which the Couacil
resolved, that a message should be sent to
the Diredtory, desiring information of the
measures adopted to prevent and check the
like disorders ; which resolution renders the
Directory at once Judge and party.
Camus having in the fame Sitting been
censured by Dumolard for having illegally
granted 750,000 livres in specie to the
Minister of General Police, was forced to
confefs, that it had bein done for the pur
pose of enabling the latter to pay the
Emissaries of Government to influence and
diredt the eledtions, The lift of candidates,
Ex Members of the Convention, which was
sent Belgium to cause them to re-eledtsd,
consisted mostly of Jacobins, as Poulain,
Granapre, Fourcroy, Goupillon de Font
ney, Delmas, Matthieu, Treilhard, and
Richard, The reft belonging to what is
called the party of the Belly (du ventre),
whichof late has adopted Jacobinprinciples,
in order to support the Diredtory. To this
party belong Berlier, Cambaceres, Dannou,
Jard, Ponvillien, and Quinette. Not one
single moderate was on the lift which shews
the system and sentiments of the adtual Go
vernment of France; but to Judge by the
Eledtors chosen in Belgium it should seem
that the aim of the Diredtory will be frufta
the, and that none but men of moder
ate terms and pacific sentiments will be cho
sen Deputies by the Belgians.
The Resolution of the Council of Five
Hundred, which binds the Eledtors to pro
mife'attachment to the Republic, was vig
orously opposed in the Council of Elders by
Troncon du Condrai, Portalis, Dumas,
Barbe Marbois, and other celebrated ora
tors. A nominal appeal having been called
for, 114 votes were in favour of the Refolu,
tion, and 94 against it; so that it was adop
ted with the small majority of 20 votes
LONDON, April xB.
Five of the seven deputies of Paris are men
' of known patriotism ; the two are at lealt equi
vocal.
Bonnieres was an advou'.: to the ci-devant
parliament of Paris ; a man of fiiperfitial know
ledge, an indifferent writer, and a verbose
orator: he is known to be an enemy to the re
volution, and to have entertained a correfpen
dence with the ci-devant courtt d'Arto's during
the eonflituent aflcmbly. A letter of his to
d'Artois Was intercepted by the Canute du Se
, chtrcbes ; and Bonnieres was screened by the
interference of a private friend who had influ
cste on the committeeâBonnieres was the
1 counsel of M. d'Artuis, and of mod of the
princes and great fatnil'e. of the French nobili
ty ; he was etefled miirber of the second na
' tional assembly, but refufed to aefcept. Howe
ver, as he is a time-serving man, and above all
things consulting his own intceft, he may,
' without having altered his principles; be new a
ftrenuotis supporter of the present confutation ;
t and it is in that way alone, and from his proba
ble profefKoiv ef republic.liifm in tha popular
assemblies, that we may account for his late no
mination.
Murinais is a ci-devant noble, a good officer
of cavalry, a vrry violent member of the cote

which has not been salfely commented on I
anil 'nduttrioufly exaggerated by the prints I
devoted to oppoiition, to gratitify the ha- ii
tred and jealousy of the Party against Ad- ii
miniftratiori. Steady to this principle of t
gross misrepresentation, a trturnmg paper of t
yesterday has seized with avidity the recent f
â discontent manifeftedbythefeamen on board f
the Grand Fleet, and has/ with its accuf- c
tamed malignity and falfehood, made it the t
ground work of a molt violent inteftivc a- r
gainst bis Majesty's ministers. But as the r
plain statement fafts could not authoaize r
the inferences which the writer _wifhed to
establish, he. found it necessary to ftiift his !
ground, rnd afTert that the discontent arose t
from the wages of the men being one year in c
arrear, whereas it is positively known, that f
it has been only produced by a demand for
an increase of pay in future. Â£

TO THE RIGHT HON. THE LORDS COMMIS- 1
SI ON ER S OF THE ADMIRALTY. 1
We, the seamen and mariners in and be- I
longing to his majesty's fleet now lying at 1
Spithead, have received with tlieutmoft satis- 1
faftiori.and with hearts full of gratitude,the <
bountiful Augmentation of Pay and Provi- '
fions which your lordships have been pleafcd 1
to fignify shall- take place in future in his
majesty's royal navy by your order, which 1
has been read to us this morning, by the
command of admiral lord Bridport.
Your lordships having thus generously
taken the prayer of our several petitions in
to yo*r serious consideration, you have given
fatisfaftion to every loyal and well-disposed
seaman and marine belonging to his majesty's
fleets ; and from the assurance which your
lordships have given us refpefting such other
grievances as we thought right to lay before
you, we are thoroughly convinced, should
any real grievance or other cause of com
plaint arise in future, and the fame be laid
before your lordships, in a regular manner,
we are perfectly fatisfied that your lordships
will pay every attention to a number of brave
men, who ever have and ever will be true
and faithful to their king and country.
But we beg leave to remind your lordships
that it is a firm resolution, that until the
flour in port be renewed-, the vegetables and
pensions augmented, the grievances of pri
vate fh'ps be redressed, an act pafied, and
his majesty's gracious pardon for the fleet
now lying at Spithead be granted, that the
fleet will flot'lift an anchor ; and this is the
total and final answer.

3 former ; she is named L'lncroyable, is up
wards of 400 tons burthen, mounts 24, guns
on her main deck, and had on board 220
r men. The prisoners fay, that she is the
- fwifteft failing yeffel that ever failed from
France, and would never have been taken, and
but from having been becalmed, aud the d:d
Flora bringing up the breeze tvith her.â twe
Tiia chacc lasted three days ; the Pearl hav- El
ing chafed her from the 11 th in the morn- fan
ing ; and it was not till the 13th at midnight the
that she furfendered. Four days previous mi;
to L'lncroyable being chafed by the Pearl, del
she fell in with in the night, another French tlic
privateer, called Le Cheri, when an aftion 1 i
commenced, which lasted between two and nic
three hours, before they discovered their 0:1
mistake. The dillance of their engaging dei
must probably, have been very great, as no to
man was hurt on either fide. b'J l

1 ExtraÃ of a private letter.
i 'â¢ Yesterday at 11 o'clock, lord Spencer f
1 and two other lords of the Admiralty arri- I
. ved, in order to fettle the grievances which < t
. the seamen of the fleet make the pretence S c
r of their late disobedient and disorderly con- ,ii
r dust. As soon as their arrival was made ' c
f known, lord Bridport, fir Alan Gardner, 'li
and Admiral Colpoys, waited on their lord- j f
. ships, who was attended by fir Peter Par- : n
1 ker, the Commander in Chief at this port. Â£
1 " Yesterday failed his Majesty's ship i
. Romney, with a convoy, to Newfoundland, v
after being liberated from an embargo laid r
upon her by the sailors of the fleet, who f
t were resolved no ship should fail until they
e were assured their demand should be compli
- ed with. The duty of the fleet is not fuf
-3 pended, though the seamen are perfeftly r
s matters, and do just what they please. Ev- j
a cry ihip has a yard-rope ready at '.he fore- t
d yard-arm, to hang any person who breaks
- through their own regulations ; still no in
d fults are offered to any of the officers, whose
necessary orders are carried on as before this r
s confufion commenced. I fear it will be dif- [
e ficult to comply with all the demands of the 1
â¢- sailors, jvho have been evidently set on by i
d villains who are known traitors tq^their king t
and country. The La Nymphe is just arri- 1
ved, and the Monarch gone out of hafbour,
to Spithead.
The Royal William's crew not cheering 1

f- " The discontents which have for several i
[- days existed, and still exist, on board the 1
a Grand Fleet at Spithead, have assumed a ve- <
[y ry formidable and systematic charafter.â
e The business of the seamen is condufted by
i- a Committee, chosen from amongst them
selves, of four men from each ship, who
hold their discussions in the Admiral's cabin
of the Royal George. They have publifh
rl ed their petition, which is now in the press,
le and is to be distributed gratis amonft the
)- fleet to-morrcrw morning. It consists of fer
is veral pages. The purport -is said to be, â-
O firftâincreafe of pay to I foilling per day ;
le full <weight of provi/ions of 16 ounces to the
m poundâa greater proportiou of prize mcneyâ
and an afyhtM or puifun for allpsifim ry-.-jfr
d:d in thefervicc. It is underfloeid that the
two firft demands havÂ£ been acceded to by
â Earl Spencer, fo.fnras promising to lay the
fame before his Majefly ; but this prcraifc
they are not fatisfied with, and are deter
miiv:d to know the result of his Majesty's
deliberation on their petition. At present
the whole fleet is entirely at their command.
The take the boats at pleasure, and commu
nicate ship with (hip. Yesterday they sent
0:1 board the Romney, of 50 guns, and or
dered her to sea : The cl-ew were anxious
to flay, to know'the refuft of the petition ;
but the Deputation which was sent onboard
said, it was for the good of the country
they (hould go with the convoy, and abso
lutely ordered them to proceed to sea ; and
in confequeflce the ihip got under weigh,
and went down *0 St. Helen's immediately,
where (he only waits sos a fair wind.
GO SPORT, April 19.
The seamen in Hafler hospital lmve join
ed the sailors, and express their approbation
of their proceedings by a flag which-they
have flying, and by huzzas.
There is not so much as a wcrfhan per
mitted to leave the (hips. They will not
fuffer a line of battle Ihip to leave Spithead,
only frigates with convoys. There are very
few boats fuffered to go 011 ftiore, and scarce
an officer is to be seen in Portsmouth,
Portfea, or Gofport. A ship went out of
harbour this day, and, directly she got into
Spithead, gave three cheers, the signal for
joining the fleet. The (hop-merchants are
not even permitted to come on (hore, âthey
let boats come along-side to bring them
goods. The whole of the marines on board
are disarmed, and they have got the keep of
the magazines.
LONDON, April 27.
An express was received from PortfmoutTi
yesterday morning, flaring that the harmony
at length restored to the fleet happily con
tinued, and the firft division of the fleet get
under weigh to fall down to St. Helen'sâ
This is a fatisfaftory proof of the genuine
and loyal character of British seamen. The
moment that their grievances were redrefled,
they returned to their duty with cheerful
nefs and alacrity. That it may be for ever
buried in oblivion is our earnest prayer, or
that it be only recolledted to prove that
there is not the horror in representations of
grievance, which a corrupt government is
inclined to impute to all petitions ofthe peo
ple. That harmony may be perfectly re- ,
stored, ft is surely indiscreet to enumerate
j and record all the instances of intemperate
behaviour that may have occured on board
particular (hips. In such a crisis, an expres
sion, however inoffenfive, may have given
disgust ; and a valuable, gallant officer, may
be injured in his reputation by the mere
breath of rumour. To retail all the mis
chievous reports of the Platform at Ports
. mouth, and colleÂ£t all the stories which were
magnified on every repetition, would only
serve to sow the feeds of future jealousy and
discord in the fleet, and prevent the union to
which the natur.il generality of the hearts of
our seamen is inclined.
We deprecate also the lamentations of.
those who pretend to fee in this great event,
i a revolution in the fy item of British discipline.
This whining cant may make the change
| which they affeÂ£t to deplore ; since it is an
â¢ acknowledgment of weakness that would
â  engender and animate disobedience. But
let us view it without prejudices, and we
(hall view it without alarm. The grievan
ces must have been severely felt and long
fuffered that could give rife to a confederal y
, so geneif.l, so fyftematfc, so well combined,
and so temperately conducted. Its manage
ment is a proof that it was not the effeft" of
sudden passionânor was the feeling local.â
In what new light then,- does this event
r serve to make us consider the Bririfh feamer. ?
- ' Are we to learn from this, that they are p<--
I tient and forbearing, but when roused, firrr,
; \ constant and unconquerable. Thank God,
- it was always their character, and it will
e continue to be their character. This event
, has created no change ; except, as we have
- said before, that it will serve as an ufeful ad
- monition to government no f to (light the
grievances of the seamen when presented in
5 in the prudent and humble guise of a petition

Counter Revolution in the Venetian Territory. â¢
MILAN, April 4.
The Republican Revolution in some of '
the Venetian towns, in which, the French '
have as yet taken no direst part, does not ,
meet with such universal approbation, but
many bloody frays have been the confe- 1
quence. About 4000 inhabitants of the 1
mountains of the province of Bergamo, and
particularly of Im gna and St. Martino, â
who do not wish any change in their Gov
ernment,have opposed the inhabitants of the
town, and on the 30th of March advanced
against Bergamo. The people of the towli
drew out their artillery ; and many of the
Peasants were killed, wounded, or taken pri
soners. The dead were exposed the whole |
day in Bergamo, before the tree of liberty.
Other parts of the provinces have declared
for the towns and their revolution.
We learned the day before yesterday,
that a corps.of national guards, who arrived
with some artillery at Salo, on the Lake of
Garda, met app rently with a fraternal re
ception, butwere afterwards surrounded, and
partly killed or taken prisoners. Many of
the inhabitants of Milan, Bergamo, and
Brescia, are now inarching against Salo, to
take vengeance of that city.

VENICE, April 8.
The inhabitants of our continental pof
fefiions, who were forced to a revolution in
the manner of the French, are full of re
sentment. The city of Crema hasrefuftd
to accede to the revolution of the citiis of
Bergamy and Brescia, and would not plant
the tree of liberty. Eight hundred Revo
iutionifts from adjacent places entered the
town, and forced them to accede to the re
volution. This proceeding made all the
Peasants of the diftrifts of Cremafco, Sa
lo, &c. rife in arms, and march against the
troops which were ordered against them,
under the commaifd of three revolutionary
Generis, namely, Counts Leech i, Ferdi
dand Gambara,, with two pieces of cannon
from Brescia. The Peasants, assisted by a
few hundred Venetian regulars, killed or
took the three Revolutionary Generals, and
killed 300 men of the national guards of j
Brescia, and took as many more prisoners.
Since this event, most of the inhabitants of
the Venetian provinces are determined to
defend the old Constitution and their homes
from the rage of the Revolutionists, and the
adherents of the French.

Coward to whom it (hall belong.
On the Bth June, walking from the coffee-hoiifc
to dinner with feme company, I mchtiopM a cur
rent report and whicfi II ad just heard at the coffee p;
house, That Wilsoij Hwkt, in a late challenge he |j t
lent to Mr.iORR, had contrived afterwards to have
â¢ it known, for when the conftahles arrived to bind
him over, he had his sureties ready. I went home J
and never mentioned or thought of the report a
gain. Between 11 and 12 o'clock at night I was h
called on by major De Butt* with achallengc from ,
Wilson Hunt, to meet him at 5 o'clock the n xt
morning. I went instantly out to lee him, and
found him between my door and the corner, and
was going to speak, but hefaid he would not hear
ine, I must comply with his terms, and if I had a
ny thing to fay, I must speak to maj<,r Dje Butts ;
upon which I complained to major De Putts or
this ungentlemanlike treatment, told him 1 knew
of no injury I had done Mr. Hunt, that what I
had fa id was a common report, and 1 cbuld fud
him an author. I requefied him to call on Mr. f
Hunt and persuade him to let me speak tah.m. {J
Major De Butt 9 returned and said Mr. Hunt tl
was not to be pacified,.and was resolved to publifli n
his letter if I did not meet him by j o'clock. I v
declared I would not meet him at that d
hour, for I was neither provided with a friend or a
weapons and I thought when Mr. Hunt cool'd c
on the bulinefs, he would allow me to explain to f<
him; for though it was .a commcn report, yet I j
had an author. I asked major De Butts if he had e
not heÂ«rd*the report ; he said yes. 1 alked him if J v
he thought J ought to meet Mr. Hunt ; he said no. | n
1 told him as. he behaved so candidly with r.ie, that ' ft
I would leave the matter to him, and that if Mr ' t!
Hunt still perfiftedin making me the author, and j
would receive no explanation, 1 mod afluredly J ,
would meet him. He said he fhoyld not fee Mr. j
H. that night, but he knew Mr. Hun.t- was deter- '
mined to. publiih the letter. We parted it was j *
about 1-2 o'clock at night. The next morning 1 (
heard the letter was pub lifted, j immediately car
ried my answer to major De Butts who,perufed
it and made some little correction, and I then sent
it to the press. All this time I had not seen his
publication, presuming it was no more than the
letter I had received, but I afterwards discovered
he Jiad introduced the letter to the public with a j
preface branding me with the name of coward. (
A new face of things now appearing it became ne
cessary that I ftiould wipe away this aspersion that
might fall on me and triy children if fuffered to"
pass over in lilence.
I resolved to call this intemperate young man to
account. I then requested my friend gen. M'Pher
fon to wait on him and inform him 4ie must retra&
-that word and that I was willing to receive an apo
*' logy,:Â£9l* I did not wife td 'hlarry him into a duel.
General me he had waited
. on Mr. Hunt, who laid he-would endeavor to find
his friend and would then give him his answer.
After this the next day I was waited on by Mr.
Higbee who wiftied to be a mediator on "this oc
caflon and tliought he would be able to persuade
Mr. Hunt to do the thing that was proper. The
time was gqfipened and retracled by Mr. Hunt
till about 9 O'clock the evening of {he 10th instant,
- when General M'Pherfon waited 011 rae and told
i me Mr. Huht would make nÂ« ate logy, arnd that
on Sunday morning at 6 a'Clock would meet at
" Cooper's.upper ferry in llace of Jersey. This
ipbt was mutually agreed on to relieve Mr. Hunt
who was already under the fivil authority cf thi
- state. I then parted with suy friend Gen. M*Phcr
son, saw no one else, and some time after went to'
e bed. About Ji o'clock that night 1 was waited 011
D as Mr.Hu.nt terms it, by the civil authority, whom
I thanked for their tender concern of me, and dis
missed them. At 6 o'clock the next morning I
waS on the ground appointed in the state of Jer*
ley. During our passage across the river and whillt
on the ground 110 conversation relative to this bufi
. ness passed between the General and myfelf. He
requested me to wait on the ground till he went to
the house to look for Mr. Hunt. He returned and
brought Mr. Higbee, who before he left Philadel
-11 phia laid he had informed Gerieral M'Pherfon that*
a the civil auuhority had interfered, who replied that
the ground was not changed as to Mr..Hunt's situ
s atiou ; Mr. Higbee hen went off after compai ing
1 their watches artd said, they would moll unqucf
t tionably- be on the ground. (General M'Pherfon
0 never related to me any of this conversation wkh
y Mr. Higbee-till after his return :) Mr. Higbac
then mentioned that he called on Mr. Hunt to at
tend him to the place of meeting, hut who replied,
