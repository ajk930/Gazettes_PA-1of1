St. CROIX BOUND ART.
1h a matter wherein the infereft of this "
much concerned, our rea&ra inÂ»y wish t* I know its
true fltoation : -
In the month of Atlguft, 1756, the two original
Commifiioaen, Mr. Howell, and Mr. Barclay, met
at Halifax, in pÃifuance to the sth article of the
Treatypf Amity, Commerce and Navigation, with
Great -Britain. The two Conrmi(Â£Â®nerÂ«, on tire
89th ot that month, appointed by iflloice,* (not by
lot,) the Hon. Egbart Benton, Etc. one of the
Judges of the Supreme Judical Cou t of the ftaie ,
of New-York, the third Commiliioicr. On the j
26th September, Mr. Benfon arrived fiom New-
York and met'the other coEimilStinert at St. An
drews, near the mouth of the two river* for. which
the partiee contend at the boundary. Tliofe rivers
are four leagues apjrt at theii mouths, where they
empty their waters into the Bay of Paflamaquaddy,
'near the Bay of Fuody : bitt nhey diverge, one
to the weft, and the oiker to the north, so that their
heads, or iVurces, art at a gr<Â»t dillance from each
other.
On the sth of O&ober, the Commissioners took
the oath as required by the Treaty ; and appointed
Edward. Winflow, Esq. of Frederiekftou, in the
Province of New-Brunlwick, (formerly of Plym
outh, in Maffachufett*) Secretary to the Board,,
and the oath of fidelity was administered to him.
The Baard being thus formed, the agent for the
United States filed his memorial, requesting thatthe
eafternmaft of the two rivers, called by the native
Indians theMagaquadavie, should be declared to be
the river St. Croix, truly meant and intended,' tin
der that name, as the boundary mentioned in the
Treaty of Peace made in 1783. And propoling
to offer evidence, and arguments to support his me
morial, if the agent of his Britannic Majesty should
deny, that to be the river intended in the Treaty
of Peace as the river Saiat-Croix.
The agent for his laid Msjetty being Served with
a copy of that memorial, Sled another on the behalf
of his government ; therein stating that the wcllern
of the two rivers, by the native Indians called
Scondiack, Ssint-Croix, truly meant and
intended under that name, in the Treaty of Peace ;
and refuelled that the Beard would declare that to
be the river so intended and afligned Hirers reasons,
and arguments in favor of his memorial.
The foiircc of the river is very important in the
business. because a line js by the Treaty to be drawn
due north from the fouree of the river C 6 the high
lands, as the line the t-vro nations. Two
lines drawn, due north from the source of the two
rivers above mentioned, will be nearly about sixty
miles from each other, and extend from the fu neai
ly one hundred and forty miles.
This dillance of the two lines, from'each other,
is as they are severally dated by the agents, in their
several claims. The British agent, claims the Btoft
western of the Scondiack Lakes, which it near the
river Pcnebfcot, as the fouce of the river Scondi
ack, and the agent for the States, claim* a place
on the Magaquadavie at the source of that river.
Which is right, or whether either is so, is to be de
termined by the Board.
The Commissioners are obliged to declare which is
the river truly intended as the St. Croi*, in the
Treaty, and to determine the, latitude, .and longi
tude, of its mouth and source. To this end, sur
veys of both rivers became, necessary. And one
from the United States, and one from the
Britilh Government," were appointed to survey
each river: Those artists returned from the business,
on the last of November, having not then completed
their work.
The Commissioners after taking the testimony
of some Indians, produced by the agent of the
United States, as witnefTes, and after determining
on the mode of admitting evidence, establishing
the rate of wages of theartifls and labourers employ
ed, adjourned to meet in Boften on the second
Tuesday of Augoft, 1797. It is agreed, and deter
mined, that the arguments shall be in writing, filed
by way of memorial before the Board, dating the '
evidence ; and that the Secretary (hall prepare, and
deliver one copy of the whole to the agent of eacfe
nation, to be by him delivered to his" government.
The argument on the part of the United States is
diredted to be forwarded to the agent of his Britan
nic Majesty, by the firit day of February, i jgj ;
that he may have time to prepare his leplv

CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REYRES E M T ATI V rSÂ»
Monday, January 16âContinued.
Mr. Gallatin's speech continued.
Again, that tax, he sard, would not oily fall equal- I 1
iy upon the people, but also upen different djftrifli P s
country He would fay that if he were to chufe be- 1
tveen Atax en fait or one on land,' he Siould certainly 1
prefer the latter, fines the inhabitants Â©f his diftrifl '
would be Â»our tunes more aiTefled by one than the o
tiier , because, being very remote from market, their
and Â» comparatively finall value, but
fhey use nacre fait th an per font living nearer the shore,
and would consequently pay twice as much according 1
to their numbers as perious nearer to market, while in ,
a land tax, they would pay one half, in propprtion to !
their number ; because their land was of left value in '
proportion to that of an equal number, of Â» Â£r f on , ] iv .
ir\g nearto fca ports.
Nor wÂ«s this all ; he looked upon a tax upon fait of 1
so unequal a nature, that there was scarcely any tax .
which he would not sooner agree te. You may, said -
UPO ", * e 1 eertain *â "Â«Â»Â».
they Â»ill be borne ; but the moment you add to them,
you overset the whole. In parts very remote from the
ea fait was at an enormous prtte. It might be said
the enereafe of a few cents could not be much â¢ but
Jt Were ever Ktk it
would be wopoflible lo pay it.
1 Having made these eb!ervst:ene in fait, he would
readily agree with gentlemen that a direct tax was noi j
a vcrj agreeable Thing. lie felt hirnfelf, and he knew 1
his coriftituents would feel, that it wai worse than no
tax tl all ; but, he believed, except the import on
some articles could be advanced, they had no resource
biri in direfl taxes.
Jf they find a tax on fait, or upon stamps (a mofl
ediousthing) cannot be laid, they must havejecourfe
to a direfl tax ; and if it could be done with propriely
it should b l -" done. _ \
He would notice only one femark which fell from
the gentleman from New-Jersey (Mr. Henderfon.)
He mentioned three articles upoh which additional
import might be laid, viz..clocks, watches and tea.
IHe said he ought to have credit for his ingenuity; finee
! those were three articles which were more fmugjled
into the United States than any other, and the duty
upon which, on that account, it had b<cn contemplat
ed to lower. He had also mentioned the sale of public
land. He believed no great expe&ations'coiild be had
from that quarter, as no towuftiips' were expe&ed at
prdint to be fold. Besides, if money should arise
from the sale of land, it could not go to pay the 6 pÂ«r
eents. They must be paid out of the {revenue. On
reference to the adl, this would be seen.
Mr. G. concluded by fayin <, he dii! not mean at
present to enter more into the fubjetf <sf direfl taxa
tion, as what he had heard against the iyftem was of
so trifling a nature as not to dcl'erve particular notice.
Mr. Muhlenberg, from the committee to whom it
was referred to report whether any and what additional
Handing rules were neceiTary to be added to tliofe al
ready adopted, reported the following -. " That every
member prefeflting a petition or memorial, shall llÂ«te
its contents, and if it appear in substance the fame as
has been already decided upon in the Houie, it fioall
not be received, except new matter of faifls appear
therein?'
A bill was received from the Senate, for giving
forceand effe& to the laws of the United States :n the
state of Tt-nneflfee, which was twice read and ordered
to be committed to a committee of the whole.'
Adjourned.
Tuesday, January 17.
Mr. R. Sprigg prel'ented a petition from Samuel
Green, deputy postmaster of Annapolis, praying for
an enereafe of falary.âReferred to the committee on
the iÃbjett of port-office and port roads.
Mr. Huncok presented the petition />f Griffith Grif

Mr. Madison moved th at the Heufe should resolve
itfcjf intc a committee of the whole, on thÂ« Algerine
business; for which purpose he fuppefed It would be
necessary to clear the house and galleries. Thty were
ac'eeidingly cleared, and the business occupied -the
house for the remainder of the-Day.
Wednesday, January ig.
Hie house being in a committee of the whole on the
fubjeS of further revenue, Mr. Dent, in the cl.air.
Mr. Williams said hÂ« cÂ«uld have witoed that the mo
tion for portpouing this bufnufs had succeeded, in or
der that the house might have gone into a committee
of the whole on the report refpefling the military erta- 1
bliftment, in order that it might have been ascertained
whether certain deduflions which were contemplated
would not take place. He trusted they would, which
together with certain dedu<slionÂ» from the naval esta
blishment, would considerably reduce the sum propo
sed to be raised by a direst tax. He thought therefore, 1
it had been better to have gone into the lubjedt of ap- 1
propriations before they eame to a cftnclufion on the -
present, business. For bit own part, tie said, whatever 1
ium might be wanted, it was his opinion that it would |
be best to raise it hy indiretl taxes j lince he could not
confentto grrjnto a fyrtem of direfl taxation, until in- â 
direfl taxes should be exhaufled. But he believed if
the prefect revenue was not diminished by unforefeen '
difficulties, it wpuld prove equal to all the demands |
which mijjht come against it. This being the (jafe, it I
was only necessary for them to organixe a direfl tax,
in order to have it ready to be resorted te in cafe of ne
cessity; end, in that cafe our citizens would meet it
with cheerfulnefs : He was teHfidsnt that our govern
ment eould'be supported by direfl taxes, and he wish
ed to convince other powers that this was the cafe. He
despised the cringing to auy nation. Let them, said he,
mtw*upt our commerce, yet, oa our ground, we can
adrend ourselves.
It appeared to him that a dedufliÂ«n night be made
from the naval department of 218,120 dollars, which
was the ellimate for seamen, since, as the veffcls were
not built, nor would they be for this year. In the re- '
port of the committee to whom it was referred to en- t
quire whether any and what amendments were neces
sary m the afl for the military eflablifhment, it was to t
e 1 ccomr*ended to flrike out the dragoons, and eight I
privates to the infantry ; but he thought" these would
not be wanted in the peace eflablifhment ; there would
therefore be a dednflion of the dragoons. There
might also be great deduflionsin the commiffaty's de
partment, so that in the military and naval departments
there .mighf be a deduflion of from 6 to *oj>,ooo dol
ars, probably more ; and if so, a small sum would on
ybe wanting. But if it should be supposed otherwifc,
then it would be necessary to raft absut for the best
m.ans of ra.fmg the money. He believed the m.de
proposed by the gentleman from S. Carolina ( Mr. Har- a
P "Ju u r I" , ; "" eafe to certain of the imports duties 1
we be the best. A considerable augmentation might *
nortM TÂ°/ VP M rtvrnuc from foreign spirits im- v
ported. It would not, he supposed, be proper to aug- r
ment the imp oft duty, because it might lead to fmug
g g) but an additional duty might be raised from it â¢
by way or exede. 1
The present fyft Â£m 0 f excise en winc an(l fpirit3) r
he laid, was ungual, and only one fourth part so pro- Â«
u 1 it might be. And indeed if by an increase

iiere oie, whii'h would have a tendency to prevent tjiis

the morals of the people. Mr. W. had it from the 1 /

be more burdenfdme to farmers i n general than
would be a land-tax. The only recommendation
winch a duty on this article would have, it would
be certain; but, as it operated so unequally, this
tax ought not to be gone iÂ«to, or at leaf* nog-rear
augmentation should be made. If a land-tax w-Â»

Admitting that the plan proposed by the <â¢ n
tleman from South-Carolina, of additional impofi s "
be the bed, the committee of Way. and Meani
might pe left to judge upon what artisan i ncr eafÂ«
of duty would be most proper. He fhoald
to be made chiefly upoa articles of luxury and ex
pense, but would leave any calculation upon the
fubjeA to the committee of Ways and Means.
He understood 60,000 dollars had been receired
for lands fold agreeably to the a& of l a lt feffir, nj ,-f
that aft had allowed the apportionment *f the
hind in small lots as was then fiiggefted, much more
Â«f it would have been fold; as the opinion of the
majority had however been found to be wrong, he
trusted it would be remedied this feflion, that'tht
sales might go on again, and that some very con.
fiderable might be had from that quarter.
In levying taxes, he said, we ought to have two
objedb in view, vir. the strength and wealth of our
nation ;as to the strength of oar nation, it was '
derived from the number of its inhabitants; it,
wealth from the furpluj produced by agriculture.
' ' !i Â«T should, thciefvrr. be gfcÂ«rcful hciw
they madeinfutigements on agriculture.
Hiftoiy, Mr. W. said, informed them of the
annihilation of Nations by means of direst taxation. '
He referred gentleman to the fuuation of the R O -'
man Empire in its innocence, and aflced themwhe.
ther they had any direst taxes? No ; indiveft tax
es, and taxes upon luxuries and spices from tht
Indies were their sources of revenue ; but, ?s soon
as they changed their system to direfi taxation, it
operated to their ruin ; their children were fold
for slaves, and the Empire'fcll from its splendor.
Shall we then follow this system. He trufled not.
Mr. W. said notwithilanding his objections to
direct taxes being adopted at the present time, he
had no objedhoij tÂ« the organization of a plan which
might be resorted to, i n cafe of any unforefeen
embarralament befalling our commcrce.
They ought to consider, he said, that the con.
ftitution the United States guaranteed to each
individual state, a Republican form of government,
bom* of those governments he said, were fuppert
ed by dtred taxes, and the reafoo was obvious, '
they had no other means of railing the money.
"I his being the cafe, and the constitution of the
United States haying guaranteed that right, how,
he alked, were those stateÂ« wha supported their
governments by diifft taxes at present, to answer
the demands of both claims on their lands ?
A tax on land, Mr. W. said, must be very un
equal ; because there was no way of reaching the
reonied men, who lived fn great cities, and tho'
large holder# of land, their land was in the hand*
of their tenants who must pay the tax. There
would not be less than-jotnillionsof propetty which
would escape a tax of this kind. The tax would,
therefore be unequal ; and he knew'no way of co
ming at monied men, uulefs, as in some of tho state*
men should be obliged to come forward and swear
to the fuias of money they had ori inteiell ; hut
this, he said was multiplying oaths to no effefl.
Bcfides, Mr, Vv. said, our country was io fitutr
ted, that there was 'great difficulty in getting a
land tax with any certainty. I Q the fiate of Dela
ware, Rhode Island, ConneÂ£Hcut, and s great part
of New-Jerfeyi it might be got at by valuation ;
but in other parts it operated veiy unequally. Nor
did he agree with the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. Swanwick) that the land tax in England did
not operate equally. The land tax theie was laid
by valuation ; it was true that it was eSimated in
the Doomiday Book ; but, ihough-rt -vas unequal
at fiift, it had been remedied by time, becatife when
land was transferred from oneiiand to another, it
was bought.according to the high or low price at
which it was taxed. If it was valued high, it fold
proportionally low, and if low, high in
but, in a new eouotry, like oura, he said, it wag
impofiible to lay a land tax wish any degree of accu
racy. In European countrit/, he said, the Com
moualty did not hold land. It was in fetv hands ;
but was this the cafe hoie > Or was it wifted to be
so ? Here, he said, the community at large held
land, every man, comparatively fpeakinjf held his
iarm ; or if they fop.id a difficulty in getting it,
ihey went back into the country and affilted in clear.
ir.g frefh land. Nor ought this desire ofpoffefli;.g
lain! to be checked.
Another thing, he said, they ought not to lay
a tax that ofie citizen should live upon another*
Although the gentleman fiotn Pennsylvania (Mr. Â»
Gallatin) supposed it would not cost more than
7 j-2 per cent, he brlieved it would cost more than
30 per cent, and if so, the public officers live upon
those people who pay the tax.
Mr. W. said it was notorious that we had already
too many officeis. Let any genthman take up
Neckar on the finances of France, and it Veuld be
found that there were mare officers in this goveiÃ
tnent than in France, m proportion to the number
of its inhabitants, before thfr revolution. He hop
ed, therefore, they would net be inereafed. Be
sides, in thus creating officers, the frugality and
oecanorrty of a republican government was in a de
gree destroyed. \
But H waÂ« said hv mercantile gentlemen, that
the farmer did net pay his proportion of taxes. Ve
ry few obfevations, he thought, would prove this,
I he common farmer, he said, paid a tax according
to his crop j if he had but an indifferent crop, he
bought but little mÂ«Â«haÂ«diÂ« j jbut ifhehifla goad~he parted with hj? money fieely. Some
times, indeed they get crcLit from merchants, upon
the profpeft of a goad crop, and ifthey were dis
appointed, diftrel's and ruin wcte fomctimcs the
consequence.
It was well obferted by the gentleman from
' Peenfylvania (Mr. Gallatin) that the only difficul
ty there was in collecting taxes from farmers was
owing to the want of circulating medium. The
common farmer, he observed, had little to do.with
money, he lived moltly by ba'tering one thing for
another. A common mechanic in a town had more
money pafl through his hands than a farmer in the
country.
But, Paid the gentleman Â£rom Pennfylvaoia (Mr.
Swanwick) thefarmers are becoming rich. Sup
pose they are, were not pcrfons in cities ally grow
ingrich? Did lands in the courftry, he asked, riff
equally wich lots in the city ? Did the rentssÂ»f far
mers increase with the bouses in the city : He be
lieved not, but the advantage was in favor of cities.
He would aflc how many farms in the country let
for a fun equal to that gentleman's hotel and cir
cus over the way, viz. 500! a year ? That gentle
man had charged gentlemen with voting away mon
ey for the Federal City and other purposes, with
unconcern, because the money was railed from cam-1
ujerce ; but, he would aik whether the farmers vo
ted for building frigates, and what his observations |
were when voting for a naval armament, a treaty !
with Algiers, &c. These were not for the interest
â¢f the farmer, and still there was no difficulty in
nifing money for these purposes. The next view
that gentleman took was on the banks of the Hud
fsn, to fee the farmers there fit at their ease, whilst
the peer merchant could not deep for fear of his
property at sea. If that gentleman was fond of a
rural life, hÂ« said, he should be glad if he would
come and live beside him. It might add value to
their count ry. He had no objection to his enjoy
ing hit pleasure in the way he liked best, and he
hoped he would permit them to enjoy theirs, which
he believed equal to any thing which eould be found
in all the luxuries of a city-
It had been said that it could not be ftippofed
that a farmer paid any part of the duty of gnods
fold by If merchants, he said, made had
calculations, and ordered more goods than he could
dispose of, was the farmer to be injured, because of
his folly ? The farmer femetimes mifcalcula<ed as
well as the merchant, and was sometimes obliged to
fell the whale of his produce, 3tid his farm too, to
pay his debt. But would gentlemen fay that mer
chants had not gone on wrong principles, and in-
Head of making their remittances in proper time,
had gone into land speculations, and feme of them
having gone into rhe carrying of contraband articles,
lad from (tep to step augmented our difficulties.
Merchants, he said, should Follow their true in
terests, and then they would not beembarraffed and
obliged to fend their goods to vendue to make good
their payments again at the banks; but if they
would not attend to their business, could the for
mer help it ? For his own part, he viewed all these
matters as tending to one point 5 things would by
and by find their level. The merchant would find
his true interefl ; the country was growing rich ;
luxury and Wiffipatnrti, be believed, had outrun po
pulation ; hut, he expected things would soon re
medy ihemfelves.
He was willing that the system of direst taxation
fhonld be brought forward, and organized, that at
a proper time it might be carried into effect.
He thought differently from the srentleman from
Pennfylvaniii with refpeft to the eff'e& of a land tax
on emigration. The fertility and salubrity of the
climate were such as to tempt people to Aome to
this country, but a land tax would rather deter,
than encouiage emigration. Mr. W. wished to en
courage commerce as far as was confident ; but not
so far as to injure agricultuie. The wealth of this
country, he said, arose from agriculture ; it was
froip the surplusage of agriculture that all our im
portations, and consequently the imports were paid
for. Should they rhen check it ? It was from
agriculture and rural life that population was en
creafed : From agriculture the mih'tia, the bulwark
of our nation, was supported ; a<id whilst it fur.
nifhed freight sos our vessels a. d those of foreign
countries (the fifheries excegt-d) should they ehe k
it > He thought not. He hoped, therefore, they
fcould do nothing more at prefeni thao organize
the system. This being done, we cfn have ra
L j course thereto, 111 cafe our commerce should be in
terrupted, or indircA taxation be found inefficient.
Mr. Craik said he should not follow gentlemen
through all the argument used on this occasion ;
because he thought a greater part of them inap
placable. He believed the question before them was
one of the most important which had been agitated
in that house since the adoption of the present go
vernment. And however gentlemen had attempted
by the course of their arguments to divert the at
tention of the committee from it, he hoped they
would not ftiaceed. He trolled the ingenious cal
culations of the gentleman from Maflfachufetts
(Mr. Varnum) intended to lead the committee to
believe, that instead eif improving the revenue, they
might look out for objects of expanse, as the reve
nue was'mure than ftifficient to defray the current
cxpenfcl, would have little cffrA. And when told I
by the gentleman from New jersey (Mr. Hendrr- i
son) that it would be a fubjeft of great irritation ; j
that it was an unpopular question j that the public 1
was not ready far it, it was enough to alarm the
house ; but he trusted such insinuations would have 1
110 influence upon the deeifion of the question.
He thought the good sense and undemanding of J
the house, exercised upon the materials before â¢
them, would point out the necessity of entering I
fully into the present business. There could be i
little doubt, he said, that revenue was really want- '
ed. He believed that the incorrect statement of *
the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Varnum) '
had been Efficiently expefed by the gentleman '
from Peanfylvania (Mr. Gallatin J. The only 01- J
ganized system grounded upon an opinion that re
venue was wanting, was that which had been in.
troduced by the gentleman from South-Carolina !
(Mr. Harper) and he thought from the principles '
contained in that plan, the question before them !
had a strong claim to attention. He believed
that refolutiÂ«n went to cftabliflt the principle of \
necessity to go into the plan- proposed by thr present
1 report.
The observations which had been made on the
; present question went more to the quantum of re
venue, than to the principle ilfelf- When they
1 were told they were not to meet the present propo
. fition, because it would be unpopular; because
j viewed as an engine of governmentâan unwieldy
; machine in the hands of governmeut, not to be
1 brought into operation. Such expteffians might
r create alarm ; but it was neceflary to fee how they
: were founded.
: Mr. Craik said when he looked at the situation
of the revenue, and saw the reliance which was
, placed on foreign resources, he was convinced of
the nreeffitv of adopting the ptefent measure ; and
when he reflected on the motion f or putting off the
r present question, by means of extending the iodi
re6l taxes, he was disposed' to apologise for the
present fyflem ef revenue laws. He believed they
owed their origin to exiftingcitcumftancfs. When
, the present federal government was erected, ir was
. confidcred in the namre of an experiment ; it went
into operation with fear and hope; many werenp
pofed to it; and it might be eoafidered wife and
politic t the time, that the people should have an
, opportunity afforded to examine the system, and
' that nothing should be proposed to them of an sr
i ritating nature, but that every thing should be
j carried on in as easy manner as possible. It was
probably on this account that a system of direst
taxes was not proposed to the people at la early
period.
He believed that it was a measure of policy,
which could not be questioned, that every govern
ment ought to arrange its taxes, so that eyery man
of property fiiould pay his equal proportion of them.
He believed that it was neecfTary for that purpose
to have both a plan of dirett and indirect taxation
in operation at the fame time, as when every man
bore his proportion of the public expense, it drew
tighter the hands of connexion between the people
and the government. Was there, he asked, a gen
tleman in that house, whole observations did not
furnifh him with inftauccs under the present system,
of wealthy independent farmers, felling, perhaps,
from a thoufand'to fifteen hundred bufhelsof wheat
in a year, who were so isolated by their situation,
their economy and frugality, as to make their ewu
deaths, to eat their own prodbce, arid to drink the
juice of their own fruit, and who, therefore, pay
nothing towards the expenses of government, ex
cept a few cents duty upon the felt used ? Was.it,
he sliced, right and proper, that such a dcfcription
of pofons should be excused from bearing a por
tion of the public burthens ! He thought it was
not. Thi,s affdrded one reason, amongst many,
in favor of originating diredt taxes. But there
tjvere others more weighty. Was there a man who
looked at the situation of our country, and saw the
precariout foundation on which its finances flood,
who did not tremble for the eonfequeuces I It was
not necefTiry, he said, to draw an imaginary pic
ture, nol- to excite alarm ; it wss not uecefStry to go
into calculations of what was probable ; so be re
fp'-fted abroad, it was necessary revenue should be
iiimly eftabhfhed. He believed it wu the Gwewof
government, the oil which was to keep the wheels
of it m motion.

Mr.FINNO,
IN al! the tranfaaions of our State Legiftatures for
lomc months, I have net o'oferved that any attention
has been given to tnat.heretofore much labored point
the mftitution of public schools 1 to pals over other
things, the time spent in opposing an address to the Pre
sident, after what has been done by former legislatures,
would have been amply fuffieient to the adjusting and'
maturing this important plan. Every hour's delay in
so momentous a business, is of weighty importance to
the interest of Pennsylvania. Since, if the establish
ment is to prove beneficial, the sooner we are put in
pofi'effion of the benefit, the better. If it is to be re
je<fied, it ought speedily to be determined on, that forae
fabflitute may be found ; and of the one or the other,
it is on all hands allowed we Hand in the mofl. urgent
seed : let us be relieved then, from the uncertainty we
are in, that we may know on what ground we Hand. In
the impottant point of education, as well as most other
improvements in civil life, it is seldom found that we
remain stationary: we eitffer pro, r refs or recede it is
a home question, but the seriousness of the considerati
on demands it to be put. Is not the latter at present tilt
,cafe with us ? Is a competent education' within the at
tainment of the generality ? On the contrary, is it
not lamentably confined to a number exceflively fmaU
in compat ifon with the whole mass of citizens ? As we
hope to fee perpetuated that free government we have
inftitnted, for the preservation of peace, liberty and
happiness amongst us j and as we expe& to hand down
to after ages, blefliwgs foimmenfe i so ought our anx
iety to propagate information, to inform, enlighten and
educate the whole community, to be continual and un
ceasing ; and may we not learn too late that these are
the only means in any wife adequate to this great end

A writer under the signature of Â«a citizen' in the A

into the Aurora, threatens a ferits of numbers in which

(fcndof course the President) because he has rtly'd up
on that expofitien to the motive# of the old French ca
binet, which that cabinet gave to the world, and which
tbe late French committee repeated as a mark of the
detestation due thai very cabinetâHÂ« vindicates the
French cabinet from the charge of felfijhnefiy by pro
ving thatthey were too prvfli*ate to be credited. To
destroy their Gncerity in evil and sinister motives, he
pledget himfclf to their insincerity and total indiffer

species Â»f morality in the very frent of the attack on

KxtraS of a letter from a refftOable Merchant in
London, to his friend in this City, dated Decem
ber 2, 1796.
My dear Friend,
I think it will be some fatisfaflion to be inform
ed after all has b-en fjid upon the fubjeft, that the
Minister of this coantry does not meet with fueh
difficulties as have been foretold in railing a fuffici
ent lum of money tor the fuppliei of government
for the year.
At a general meeting of the proprietor* of the
Bank stock yesterday, it was announced by the
governor, that Mr. Pitt proposed to th* public an
open ioan to which every man might fubferibe
what he thought proper, aboveone hundred pounds. 1
Suffice it generally to fay, that the terms are not
equal to an investment of money in the five per
cents, at the prcfeiit price, viz. 87 per centâyet
not far short perhaps 3 per centâthe amount asked
for, eighteen million pounds sterling : ift payment
2d January, ad, March 3d, and 4th, between then
and O&ober 1797. The Governor fait: thefenfc
of the Dire'lors had been taken on the occasion,
and it was propufcd that the Bank in its collective
capacity fubferibe one million ; and the directors
in their Individual capacity four hundred thousand
poundsâthat on the following day and iubfequsnt
ehes, books would be open at the Bank to receive
public fubferiptiuns. It was then (after some pro
pofals relating to the sum to be laid down b,y the
Bask) allied, by a gentleman present, if books
fould not be immediately o lened to receive the names
and Itims of the gentlemen present ? None had been
pitfpÂ«red, but in about ten minutes books were
got, Â»fid before night fix millions five hunufed
thousand pounds were fubferibed ; and it is thought
probable that in the course of this day the whole
18 millions will be filled Up in tbe boÂ«ks at the
Bank only, and that by the City of London. 1
may be under error but'l will hazard an opinion
that if the Minister had aflced a voluntary loan of
it-hole sum without intcrcft, be would have
pre.fii.ed it.

BALTIMORE, February 10.
About eleven o'clock the evening before last, a
of thieves were discovered to be in theftore
of Mr. Marsh. in Howard street. Notwithstand
ing the drifted fcarch was made for them, a
they were so old in iniquity, as to elude the vigi
lant-? of their pursuers,* all except one (about 12
years old and not so great an adept at thebufinefs)
who was apprehended and made to- inform of the
reft. They were four in numher, all French Weft
India negroes, and belonged to one man ; nope of
them-appcared to be older than 19. It is supposed
they fktilked in and concealed themselves in the
eveniug ; and had they been able to have cleared
themselves with their booty, might have preferred
that mode, during the existence of patrelei, to firing
and pillaging. They had nearly broken open a
desk, before discovered. This should make peo
ple examine their houses well before they commit
themselves to deep.

The real securities given for the payment of the Prizes,
are held by the President and two Directors of the Bank

The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of
the late Commiflioners ailifted in the management of the

By accounts received from the different parts_of the
Continent as well as from Europe, where the tickets
have been sent for sale, the public are aflured that the

AN ENQUIRY
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on Morals and Huppiaefs,
By William Gobwin.
THE reputation of this work is already well efta
bliftied in Europe âIt is hardly necessary for an Ame
rican editor to fay more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning Political Justice has ever
since its publication been a favorite performance with
the friends of republican government. The stile is
pure, nervous, and ciiffical; the ideas are strongly
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, amongst
a multitude of -other just and striking paffagei, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities iafepa
rable from the condition of a King, may be pointed
out as a molt masterly specimen of philofophicjl dif
quifition. The latest London edition of this work
fells in this eity st four dollars and an half.

New-Haven, October 7, 1796.
Dear Sir,
J should have written you last week, had I then been
able to ascertain certain fails, the rumour of which I had
heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near neighbour to nie, the wife
of pbeoÃeers, and daughter of captain Samuel Huggins,
of this town, had been, tor fourteen weeks, exceedingly
distressed with'the'Rheiimatil'iK, <0 such a degree that for
fourteen weeks previous to the 29th of last month, ihc
had not â keen able to walk across the room even with crut
ches, lave only once, when file made out with the assist
ance of crutches to hobble part of the way sterol's her room.
On the 49th ot September last, she procured * set of your
metallic fcbftances, and in lets than an hour after the had
begun to ufc them, in the manner directed by you, the
rose from her chair, and walked about her houle, and on
the next day> ihc went abroad to her neighbours, having
thrown a'fidc her crutches. I have this day paid her a visit
'in company with her lather, and Timothy Toms, Bfq.
who lives in the street where the resides and directly op
posite to htif residence, and with Capt. Abel Burrett, who
islier next neighbor, and lives within eight yards of her
door. I requested her to relate her cafe over in their
pretence, which she did, and thefÂ« gentlemen all with one
voice, supported, from their own knowledge, her flory.
It is a duty which yois owe yourfeif and the world to pro
muljje this event. I am, very refpeftfully,
Your obedient forvant,
Pi R R PONT EDWARDS.

This may certify, that the fubferiber, HHffc visits among

lieve pains and inflammations oi various -kinds, and has
fucccedcd to hii aftoniffiment. They have seldom failed
to relieve the head-ach, teeth-ach, ague 111 the fÂ»ce, in
flammation in the eyes, craixjp, cholic, rheismatifm, pains
of the.breast and fide, biles, icalds and burnsâSometimes
there has been a perftit cure from one operation. A lad
who had been confined tkree days with high symptoms of
a fever, very hot and full of pain, by an operation of the
points, designed to relieve his head, his face turned .pale
and cold, his fever and pain immediately left him, and in
a few days he was Â©tit of doors j the year betore, at the j
fame feafen, he was taken with the fame fympcoms, and
lay cxtrerr. Jy sick forty days. The efficacy of the metal
lic points has gained great credit in this town.

Rev. ELHANA'N Winchester,
I certify, that on the sift of March, 1796, I few Dr.
Perkins's method of cure by pointed metallic instruments,
tried with fuccefsinthe poor-houfeor bettering-honfe in
Philadelphia ; especially npsn a man who was unable to
lift his right hand to his head, as was tried beforehand, bnt
who after a few minutes operation, -was able to remove it
at pleafure .5 and in my light, put it witheafe oÂ« the top
of his head and back of his neck, and in all directions.
Nearly the lame effect took place upon a woman ; and
Ail that I saw treated, profeffed that their pains "uafed
after being treated a ihort time -. and several came volun
tarily, and in my hearing thanked the Dr. for cures he
had performed on them about sight week* before, in re
moving paiils from them, which they declared had not
since returned :âfo that from -what I Taw with my own
eyes, ant! what 1 have heard, I have great hopes that this
methed vrill greatly tend to alleviate the miseries of man

MOST delightfully situated on the north bank of Rap

the Hate of Virginia, conMing as eleven or fifteen hun
dred acres, as may bed suit the purchaser. There is ob
'this estate, a large and well built brick house, containng
nine commodious ipacious hull or en
try, 2 2 feet square, two pair of Hairs, suitable and conven
ient palfages, and excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine healthy eminence, commanding beautiful views in
every direction over the towns Â«f Fredericklburgh and
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country. âThe
grounds adjoining the house are neatly laid out in pleas
ure und kitchen gardens intcrfperfed with a variety of
l'carce trees, a choice collection of flowers and flowerjng
ihrubs, and enriched by various forts of the following
fruits, viz apples, pears, walnuts, chefnuts, eherries, peach
es, plumbs, ne<starines, apricots, grapes, figs, rafberrics,
goofeberries.ftrawbcrries,and currants; the whole admi
rably varied by turfed Hopes which have been formed by â 
great labour and expence. Bordering upÂ»n these im
provements, are several lots, in a highftate of cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from
which three heavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large and flourilhing orchards; one
of wÂ«ll cliofen peach trees, the other of apple and pear
trees, felededfrom the belt nurseries in the state. Pro
perly detached from the liianfion house are extenliv#
roomy offices-of every denomination, viz a Kitchen and
Larder, house-keeper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
underneath for a variety of purposes, a ftore-t oufe aÂ«d
iiunke.haute all of brick, a dairy and spring house of stone. â¢
Stables for thirty horles, apd coach houses for four car
riages. Alio a large and well planned farjji yard, m ith
bani and granary, a cow house, with separate jftalls for
thirty-fix grown cattle,; apartments for fattening veals,
mutton* and lambs 1 extensive sheds for sheep, and other
arrangements for itock of every defcriptionTwilK a large
and convenient receptable forprovender, from which they
can be furnifhed without being exnofed to the inclemency
ot the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's (hop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best rjian- '
lier nvote than fiftylabourers.
The arable lands are advantageously divided as to af
ford an opportunity.of making a large quantity of Indian
corn annually, without bringing the field into fimiiar culÂ»
tare oftner than once in four years; consequently the
lands may be improved by keeping up the inclofures during
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowpd for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On the prenxifes there is also a merchant mill with one
pair of best French burr stones, and one pair of, Cologne j
furnilhed with modern machinery, and now leafed for the
unexpired term ol four years, at ijol per annum, and all
grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, whichis near
ly iool. more. Thi mill and mioer'shoufe are built of
I'ree.ftone, within a very small distance of navigation,near
to which are two or more valuable lifheries, and a well
accustomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Fredcrickfburg. l'he land con tains inexhaustible quarriei
of free ftene near to the fiver, is plentifully iupplied wi:u
remarkable fine water and poiTeffes a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be considerably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. Jn fait, e&clufive of
an improveable and well conditioned farm, the value and
emolument, inseparably connected witn a mil), ferries,
fifheries and quarrjes eligibly Urinated ; the profits arising
from an ice-liouie inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetable*
of.all forts as to jbe fully equal to the demand in market,
there might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, \Vjhich the fubferiber
conceives it uaneceffary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be foand to be a complete,
pleasant and healthy residence, possessing beauties and
conveniences fufficient to attrafl the attention of any pfr
fon defirousof becoming a purchaler.
The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an estate so singularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where We
can with more ease attend to hit interests in the neigh
bourhood of that city.
The purchaser may be accommodated,with a few slave*
in families, either for plantation or domestic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balanc#
made easy, the debt being properly secured.
