For services which France hus render'd ;

To give efTefi to such a plan.
In vain, I fit/, is all this racket,
With now and then a bribe, to back it.
The man, whom fag'smuft revere,
Whose Came admits of no compeer ;
The man who has been faithful found,
His country's frierid, whan fortune frown'd ;
The man, whofpite of- Gallia's art,
Is throu'd in every Federal heart ;
The man, who justly may look down,
On paltry things that wear a crown ;
Whose virtue*, even foes declare,
While envy shrinks to pale despair,
Prtfiding o'er a happy nation,
Adorns his elevated station.

How every auditor so fad is.

With pride and nonfcnfe, overweening,
AUfurdly "blunder round their meaning
Fellows, who have combin'd to level;
With their friend Democrat, the devil,
Tear up the pillars of society,
Pull down thefabric of propriety ;
Give meekcy'd piety a flogging,

Fellows, who sped "away betimes,
To seek a refuge from their crimes ;
Who, if transported back to Europe,
Fach there, would lack a new rope,
I fay, it isnotmy titention.
One word about these folks to mention,
Left Gunn so fierce, or Blount so cruel,
Should challenge Sptakey to a duel!
Full many fine things might be written,
Of Blount's deep plot to join with Britain-,
And make the Spaniards rue the sorry day,
When he (houM drive them out of Florida !
Vut then, perhaps, 'twould be a pity,
To interfere with our Cnramittee,
Who put in motion wheel and pulWy,

Official Documents laid before Parliament. 1 di
(Continued from yesterday's Gazette )
I shall not attempt to follow the French I r<
minister through the very elaborate and cer-1 p
tainly able speech he made in reply, with I I
V view to convince me that the enquiry into I
the extent of rily full the strong- I t<
eft proof the Dir'eftory could furnifh of their I ai
pacific intention, and the shortest road they I d
could take to accomplish the desired end. I a
It was in order to give aftivity to the ne- I I
gociation, (afitver was his word) and to | d
prevent its stagnating, that this demand
made so fpeeifically ; and he intimated to I n
me, that it wsis impossible for the Direftory I q
to proceed till a full and fatisfaftory answer I
; had been given to it. I interrupted him I p
here by faying, their manner of acting ap- I u
peared to me calculated to decide the nego- J t
ciation at once, not to give it aftivity, since I f
it must be known T could not have powers I si
of the description he alluded to : and even I o
supposing I had, the admitting it would be I t
in faft neither more nor less than a complete I n
avowal of the principle itfelf, which once a-1
greed to, nothing would be left to negoci- I t
ate about. The other Frcnih plenipotentiary I c
interposed here, .by faying, that would not I t
be the cafe ; many articles -would Jlill remain to I t
be proposed, and many points for miportani dif- I r
cujjton. I said, every word I heard seemed I c
to present difficulties. Without replying I t
to me, the firjl mentioned minijler went on by I <
endeavoring to prove, that the avowal of j
having powtrs to a certain extent, did not 1 ]
imply the nectffity of exerciling. them ; that I i
it was the a?owal alone for which they con-1 ]
tended, in order to determine at once the I <
form the negociation was to take ; that the I 1
note aud the time prescribed in it, were in I i
consequence of the most positive orders from I :
the Direftorv ; and that if I drew from it
a conclusion different from the assurances
Ithey had made me in the name of the Di
reftory, I did not make the true inference.
I replied, that although the prefcribir.g the
day on which the qneftmn was put to me
as the term within whjch I was to give my
answer to it, was both a very unusual and
abrupt mode of proceeding ; yet as a day
was much more than fufficient for the pur
pose, I should forbear making any particu
lar temark on this circumstance : that as to
the inference to be drawn from the positive
manner in which they appeared to maintain
the question put to me, .1 really could not
make it different from that I had already
cxpreffed . .that the reverting, after an in
terval of two months, to a question already
answered, and which question involved the
fate of the negociation, certainly could not
be considered as wearing a very conciliatory \
appearance. That in regard to my answer,
it could not be different from that I had
given before : that my, full powers, which
were in their hands, were as extensive as any
could be, and it did sot depend an me Ao
1 'â¢\ve th:m mor'e or W#4a*kÂ»4e ; but tlat J
! m fati their question went not tothe.extcnt the (
of th?ir full powers, but to require of me and
ta declare the nature of my inllruftions ; qu'ri
and oh this point they cAtainly would for- pnn
give hi* if Idid not speak out tiH such tunc 'hou
I alj the circumstances negociation C3l- nit- !
I led u;Â»on ni'e to 3o it. . s
The French minister ft rove to prove to it 01
I me, what he had bffore attempted, that the aries
I claiming a right of enquiry info the nature I he
I of the ftifcretionary authority confided in tent
I a nrinifter, by no means irrtplied an inten- to a;
I tion of repairing of him to aft up to its cle
I utmost limits. I observed, if no such in- I
I tint ion rxilled, why institute the enquiry? en r
I and if it did extft, why not fay so at once ? bein
I He said, what we now a(k is little more ferv
I than a matter offofm ; when yen have giv- tabh
I en us your answer, we (hall follow it up ed,
j by another step, which we are ordered to our
| take. I said, my answer was given two the
I mouths ago ; that although I was ready non
j to give it them again, and in writing, as the
I due to their note, yet, as it could not be rem
I different, I did not fee why they should not ed t
I proceed immediately to the other step, by tha
I which I was told the question was to be sol- â¢ ten
I lowed up. It would be premature, said the mui
I French minister ; but in drawing up your and
I answer, do not forget the force of the argu- do,
I ments I have used, or in your report to nisi
I your court, the assurances we have given of at <
I the earnest wish of the Directory to termi- faic
I nate the war. of
I I replied, that I still must maintain, that the
I from the manner in which they tbÂ»jughtÂ«pro-! pof
| per to define full powers, I'could fee no dif- j tog
I tinftion between acknowledging the power pet
I and admitting the principle, and that the infl
I question itfelf could r.ot he 'put with any o- tio
I ther intentionâ(Your lordihip will obftrve, me
I from the subsequent notes which passed be- Er
( I tween us, that I was perfeftly grounded in me
j this afTertion); thatin my report st hey Alight to
> 1 be fully assured I should aft up to that cob- inj
) j ciliatory spirit, which, from the earliest pe- thi
1 riod'ofthe negociation, had always decided fio
J my sonduft; and that, inauspicious as ap- eaj
I pearancei were, I certainly would be care- eft
I ful not to make them look hostile. At the th<
word hoftile,both the French plenipotsntia- re<
I ries were thoft warm in their protestations, tei
1 that nothing could be less so; that the idea wa

ip- I unneccflary to enter into any reflections on- d
jo-1 them. lam willing to hppe that the an- e

ete I my inftrufti.ons enjoin, me to hold. g
e a-1 It was my wilh to give every opening to d
>ci- I the- French pleniponentiaries to recall the vi- t
ary I olent steps they had taken | and, if poflible
not I to convince them of its extreme improprie
nto I ty. And it was with this view, and with a
dif-1 most anxious desire not to exclude all hope
ned I of the restoration of peace, that I determin
ing I ed on suggesting the idea of our meeting
by I once more .before I left Lisle.
of I This meetiag took place to-day at noon ;
not I I opened it by observing, that the several (
hat I notes they had received from me fiace the
:on-1 preceding evening had been too exprefiive
the j of the surprise I felt at the measure the di
the I reftory had thought proper to adopt, to 1
e in I make it necessary forme to enlarge upon it
rom I in this conference ; and indeed my sole mo
rn it ' tive for suggesting that it might be for our
nces mutual fatisfaftion that it should be held,
Di- was, becaufc that thi* measure appeared to
nee. me to be in such direst contradiftion to the
; the very strong assurances I had so conitantly
Ime and repeatedly heard from them, and to the
:tny pacific intentions with which they declared
and they were sent, that it was my earnest wiih
day (before I considered their conduft as forcing
pur- me to a step which must so materially affect
ticu- the success of the negociation) to be perfeft
as to ly certain that I understood clearly and dif
fitive tinftly the precise meaning of their official
ntain notes. On their admitting that nothing
1 not could be more reasonable than that I should,
ready on so important a point, require explanation
in in- or more fatisfaftory to them than to give it
ready me (as far as lay in their power), I proceed
d the ed by faying, that it appeared to me that I
d not wa? called upon to produce immediately my
atory fjill pojvers, or rather my inftruftions (for
ifwtr, however different these were in themselves,
had in their demand they seemed constantly
which bler.ded); and that if either I refufed to con
is any lert to this, or if, on consenting to it, it was
me to found that I was not authorised to 'reat on
it they laid down, I mis then in
it the fpaoc of twenty-four hours to leave Lisle
ie and return to my .court ; and that { was re
; quired to obtain full authority to admit this
r- principle, if it was tfifhed the negociation
tc Ihoutd proceed. This I said appeared to
1- nle to be the evident fcnfe of the notes, and
I begged to k.iow whether I had mistaken
:o it or not ? One of the French plenipotcnti
ie aries said, " you have underltood it cxaiSly ;
re I hope yon will equally underfland the in
in tention of the French government > which is
n- to accelerate peace by removiug every obfta
ts cle which ftand3 in its way."
n- I replied, that having'.now no dbubt left
en my mircd'as to their exaft meaning, atid
; ? being quite fare, notwithstanding the ob
re fervation they had made, j'avaii jam. la â ueri
v- table intention de leur note, it would, 1 fear
jp ed, be a very unprofitable employment of
to our time to argue either on the nature of
vo the principle they au'nounced 3s a fine quta
iy non, to even a preliminary diffcuffion, or on
as the extreme difficulty of reconciling the'pe
be remptory command with which they
ot ed their million, to the pacific profefjions
by that accompanied it j that if they were de- %
01-. termined to pertift in this dtmand, it
he much better to avoid all useless altercation ;
ur and nothing in that cafe remained for metÂ®
;u- do, but to ask for my.pafiports, and to fig
to nify to them my intention of leaving France
of at an early hour the next morning. They,
ni- said, they had their hands tied by an arrete
of the direftory, and were bound to observe
lat the conduft they had followed by the fnott
ro-1 positive orders ; and although we remained
lif- together some time longer, not a hint drop
ver ped from them expremve of a with, that
; he instead of going myfclf !fiÂ»r new inftruc
o- tions, I (hould cither write for them by a
ve, messenger, or obtain them by fending to
be- England one of the gentlemen who are with
in me. I endeavored by every indireft means
jht to fugged to them the necessity of adopt
on- ing some such modification, if they meant
pe- that their wishes far peace, iatheexpref
led fion of which they were this morning more
ap- eager than ever, should meet with the flight
ire- eft degree of credit. I again brought to
the their recollection that I was authorized to
tia- receive any propoi'al, any they
ras, tendered to me, but that they mutt be a
dea ware that if was not possible for me to alter
far the orders I had received, or to afiume an
I authority with which I was riqt invested.
ure I dwelt particularly and repeatedly on my
fts, being competent to take any thing they said
the for reference ; but this availed nothing cx
ifori cept drawing from one <if them a remark,
i of that the full powers which authorised a mi
fied nifter te hear proposals, were widely dif
ink ferent from those which would enable him
:an to accede to them ; and that it was such
as- full powers that the dircdiory required me
ess- to fo}icit.
Ned An cafy answer presented itfelf to this
the mode of reasoning ; but I few no advan
was tage to be derived from prolonging a con.
Ob- verfation, which, after the pofitfye declar
ation they .had made, could lead to no
aid, thing I therefore ended the conference Iry
aeet declaring my resolution to begin my jour-

ary, and by faying, that immediately on my ar

hich terms to wait at Lisle till I could know hrs
m. majesty's pleasure on the peremptory propo
tied fal'made to me : Bnt when I considered the

Mr. Harper called for the order of the
day on the bill for preforibing a mode of
taking eviden'ce in cases of contested electi
ons, and for compelling the attendance of
witnesses ; which being agreed to, the house
resolved itfelf into a committee of the whole
on the fubjeft, Mr. Dent in the chair, and
after agreeing to several amendments, the
committee rose, and the house having con
curred in them, the bill was ordered to be
engrossed for a third reading to-ijiorrow.
Mr. Clopton, from the committee of
enrolment, reported the bill for the relief
of North and Vefey, as duly enrolled ;
which accordingly received the signature of
the Speaker.
Mr. Dwight Fcffter moved the order of
the day on the bill from the Senate for al
lowing a compensation to the Door keeper
of the Senate and his Afiiftant during the
late session of Congress ; which being agreed
to,the house went into a committee of the
whole on the fubjeft, when an amendment
was proposed by Mr. Harper, to allow the
Sergeant at Arms of the House of Repre
feutatives, an additional compensation of
260 dollars for his two last years services,
which it was alledged, would only bring
his compensation to the fame which was al
lowed to the Doorkeeper of that house.
Some objections, however, being offered a
gainst this amendment, in order to afford
1 time for an enquiry into the faft of the dif
ference spoken of betwixt the allowances
made to the Doorkeeper, and Sergeant at
Arms, the committee rose, and had leave
to fit again.
A communication was received from the
Secretary of War, stating that the other
invalids had completed their evidence to

Brown and Corlies, of Bridgetown, was broke o
pen, and goods and caTh to a considerable amount
taken away ; but wc"> Vhappv in hearing that thÂ»
goods are recovered. Yhey wire carried to an
auflionser in New-York to be difpol'ed of.'âWhe
ther the tulprit has been feeured or not we have
not heard.
On Tnarfday evening, two foot pads made an
aflault on a Mr. Brown of Bridgetown, between
Bonamtown and Ford's tavern. Mr. Brown's con
duct was meritorious : He knocked the fellow
down with a loaded whip, who had hols of his
bridle, and before the other could take any advan
tage of his fitnation, the speed of his horse extrica
ted him from such troabkfome companions.
MELANCHOLY OCCWRRKNCES.
Lad Thursday, Daniel Chaplin, a native of Con
necticut, wha has beea a schoolmaster for feme
timepaft in SulTex, was apprehended in Rah way,
on suspicion ef being concerned in the robbery of
Meflrs Browne and Coalies' Hereof Bridgetown ;
but on examination, nothing criminal appearing a
gainst him, he was difchaig*d ; and, melancholy
to relate, foaie time titer, and with deliberation,
took a razor Â«ut of his j Â«cketÂ«"and Â«ut his throat
so efiFeftually, before ke cauld be retrained, that
hefoon expired. To add to the tragical tale, Mrs,
Craven, wife of Jefeph Craven, who beheld the
scene, being in a deiica'e flotation, was so over
come with the horrid fpeitacle, that it brought on
an abortion, and she eipired the next 11 ormng.â
The unh.ippy man, a few minutes before he com
muted the rash degi, wrote tilt following
'â¢To all that may fee this writing, I wiOi that

JOSEPH HABERSHAM,
Port-Matter General.
General Post Office,
Philadelphia, December 18, 1797* J
tuth&Â«ti4thF
New-Theatre,
December n, 1797.
THE Managers particularly re que ft the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
cuftosn, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre.
They are a-ware that gentlemen are unconfe-ious
of any wrong done to die int.reft of the inftitu
tionby thispraikicc, from a general, though naif
taken idea that Cheeks are #ic representatives of a
right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will j
when in fa&, they were never intended as more
than tokens by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcertaiii with the baft trouble to the parties, tint
they themfehes have keen before in the Theatre, or
paid for their admission.
Independent of the injury the Managers sustain,
such a praftice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other difordcriy persona to surround the doors of
the Theatre, to the aorruption of tktir morals and
the great annoyance of the Audience.
It nas also been tfct fouTce of two evils of no in
considerable magnitude; one is, that 'fomctimes
very irÂ»propÂ«r company is by these means admit
ted ; and the,other, that owiiy to Checks passing
into dilhoneft hands, they have be n frequenaly
counterfeited to a large amount fcjr the purpofesof
Sale
ThiJ flautuent will, it isrcfpe&fully hoped, in
duÂ«ethe Public to difcourags such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus alfifted,
easily pÂ«ove adequate to its entire abolition.
