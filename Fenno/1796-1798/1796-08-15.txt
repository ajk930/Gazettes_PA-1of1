from India, brought over in the American {hip
Major Pinckney, Hyatt, arrived at Dover from
Bengal. Theie were various reports in circulation
concerning unpleasant news from this quarter cf
the world, which ftemed to be countenanced by
a sudden fall of India stock. It was infilled that

reports of this nature, we could not learn any pre

" The rapid progrsfs 1 havo madfcfor the lift

have proceeded from Chamberry to Plaifance, to ;
Pizitig Litono, returned to Chamberry, and in 15 .1

rapid, that of the army of Milan was not less so. 1
It has gained, and is daily gaining, fuccefies at 1
which Europe mull look with cenfternation. Ihe i
battle of Lodi, which was obtained by one of these
strokes of audacity sb peculiar to Frenchmen, affu- .

The Auftriam army njuft be totally destroyed. 1
This obdacle being removed, we Jhall find no diffi- I

flocking to view the victorious troops, spent the reft (
of the evening in balls, suppers, and entettainments.
The national cockade was mounted, and a national ;
guard formed to do duty with the troops. Some
ruffians attempted to pillage during the tumult, but :
the mod dangerous were apprehended. A munici- 1

and what is molt extraordinary a Duke is at their
head. '

ELECTIONS USELESS ! 1

Yet 1 repeatâEledions are useless ! and I adduce
the following pafTage from the life of Lord Chat

"In Match, 1764, Mr. Pelham diedâMr. ,
Fox (afterwards Lord Holland) wished to succeed
Mr. Pelham as Secretary of State, and it is very ,
probable that his request would have been granted, 1
had he not infided upon having the management of
the House of the Commons, which the Duke of
Newcastle refofed â ! ' (
" The management of the House of Commons, ,
(as it is called) is a confidential department un
known to the conditution. Ia the public accounts
it is itnmerfed under the head of Secret Service. ,
" It is usually given to the Secretary of State, ,
when that pod is filled by a Commoner. The bu
siness of the department is to diftriÃute, with art '
and policy, amongst the members who have no ,
odenlible places, funis of money for their support .
during the ; besides contrails, Lottery Tick
ets, and other douceurs, it is no nuconjmon cir
cumstance at the end of a feflion, for a gentleman
to receive five hundred or a thousand pounds for ,
his services." [

When it is considered, that only four dayselapf
ed feetween the arrival ot the writ, and the day of

24 hours to carry on their canvas, that their rel'olu
tion of not procuring votes by threats, promises, or

â  Miniftcr carried his election by dint of Government
: influence, corruption, and by out-votes, (of the re

A paragraph inferred in the Courier Francais

in regard to the attack made on the hospital of

to prevent all diftmbance, and if the means of re
prefling'any iiforderthat might occur were no: of

The writer of the paragraph alluded to has been

it inccn\tjent on me to declare, that far from having
experienced a denial ofjuftice from the magistrates
of the State of Pennsylvania, I reeeived from them,

Philadelphia, Augufl 1, 1796.
Gentlemen, â¢
THE Merchants of this city have'for some
time palt beheld with regret a regulation, enforced
by a proclamation of the Governor, obliging eve
ry vessel coming from any part in the Weft-Indies
to perform a quarantine of five days, although the
port from which (he failed may not have had any
infectious disease ; and that no petfon on board was
at the time of arrival, or at any time dining the
passage, labouring under any such disorder. The
intention of the law which veiled so an pie a dif
cretion in the Gavsrnor. was, no donjit, intended
to prevent the importation of infectious diseases ;
and the preservation of the health of the citizens
is of so much more importance than any pecuniary
loss or embarrafmeut of the merchants, that they
have'fubmiited to the regulation, howeverunneetf
fary in thfir opinion, father than make themselves
responsible for the consequences that might arifc
from any alteration. They always retained the
hope,' however, that the neceflry of such a regula
tion would either have been demonstrated, or that
one less injurious to their interests, and equally ef
ficacious to the end in view, would be adopted.â j
Tsut fin-ling the proMV'tim continued, tnd not
being able to fattsfy themfelvcs of its necefiity,
duty to themselves and to the community, irnpcllÂ«
them to reprefeotâidly, That there are many of
the ports in the Weft-Indiei,. as heajthy and as
free from infedtioui diseases as the" city of Phila
(1-lphia. 2dly, That where vefTels have been heal
thy during the pafiage, and continued to be so on
their artival, there can be no danger from their
being admitted to pass in the com fe of twenty
four hours, in which time fati*fa&ory evidence
might be had that no impofiiie'n was intended?
jd!y, rll p.t the detention of parsons artifriig in
perfect health, confined to the narrow limits of a
vefTel, ar.d impatient to be with their families and
friends, is calculated to produce the very end that
is intended to be guarded againstâsickness and
disease. 4'l>ly, That upon every moderate com
putatiiui, taking one vessel with another, there
(will be dii attual lots of at least one dol
lars; and if the whale number shall amount as com
puted to five hundred, the aggregate will be fifty
thousand dollars, 3 loss too great to be (Ã¼bmitted
to, except it (liall be juftified by the necessity of the
cafe.
While they suggest these alterations to the board
of health, it is not their wish that they (hould be
adopted the fulleft consideration, and the
advice of fttch Phyfivians as would be competent
to advise on so important a fabjeft. If after such
consideration aÂ«d advice, these or other regu
lations less injurious to them, and equally efficaci
ous in preventing the introdu&ion of jnftftioua
diseases, can be adopted, or even the existing ones
Hiall be determined to be necessary, they will reit
fatisfied.
We have .thought it .refpe&ftll, and mod likely
to obtain a candid re-con fid erat ion of the lubjeft,
to addreis ourfelres to you ; we do it in the fulleft
confidence that you will immediately take it into
consideration, and do therein what shall appear to
be proper.

'Twas not 'till'the 14th ihft. that we en
tered this fort. Capt. Thomas Clarke whacom
manded here, had left it some hours before we ar
rived. Lieut Elmer, on account of some bufmefs
had pafied the preceding day and night in the fort.
Immediately after we entered the fort, we an
nounced it to every body and thing within hear
ing, by the discharge of 15 cannon, and'by display
ing the American colours. We are all here at
Idngthi having waited fix days at Ofwego Falls for
Capt. Clarke to take away some ot his Majesty's
(lores, for which purpose a Kingston vessel had
been hourly expected. We find the gardens left i*
good order, containing large quantities of vegeta
bles. In short, Capt. Clarke's whole conduct has
been that of prudence, politeness and benevulence.
He hag diitributed among our officers two sheep, a
bear, a several cats, and snow-shoes. We
find a plenty*>f tables, some chairs and other valu
able articles- The fort is situated on a high and
commanding ground, near, an(i in full view of tfce
grand lake Ontario. L' eut * 'Rowan, ant! Doctor
Rhodes remain here. The fort is a regular penta
gon, with five bafliotis, and accommodations for
300 men, besides store-houses, (tables, &c. The
whole would make a most handsome appearance,
if the works were not old and in a date of decay.
