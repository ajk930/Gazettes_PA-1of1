FRIDAY KVtNWG, MAY t 9
T<Â« Thomas Jeff-*son, Esquire, Vice
Prelident of the United States and Presi
dent of the Senate.
' Sir,
YOt- R arrival at the feat of government
immediately after the publication of a letter
said to written by ymi to your friend Maz
'n Italy, affords you a fair opportunity
ofdotng away any b?d imprefli.m refpefting
your charafter, which the falfeiy afcilhing trt
you improper fentimmts may hitherto have
qccaiio*ed. For the honor of the American
Dame. 1 would wish the letter to be a Forgery,
alth > 1 mult confefs, that your silence upon
the fubjeft, and the conduft of that pa>ty
with which you appear, at present, to aft,
leaves hut little probability of its not having
proceeded from your pen. If it is not your
produftion, an explicit disavowal of it ap
pears incumbent on you, for several reafous.
1. Because it implies a eontrsdiftion of
those fentimrntv, refpefting our excellent con
st 1 1ution, which you have formerly held, be
tore a disappointed ambition threw you
into the. hands of a desperate faftion, by
w.:ofe means you expefted, no doubt, to have
filled the firft office of our government.
2. Because it is a direst libel on therha
rafter of those men, whom the choice of a
free people called to the exercise of the ex
ecutive and judiciary powers of our govern
ment;â And,
3- Because its publication in a country,
from whose government and citizens we havt
met with every kind of injury and insult, has
a tendency to encourage a continuance qf
such conduft in our allies, from a pei ("nation,
that our internal situation would admit of its
exercise wiah impunity.
\ou dated truly when you reprefen'ed all
our proprietors of land as friendly to republi
can principles, and if you had gone further

the ancient dominion of Virginia, that the
R,ames of the late secretary Randolph, Giles,

lolls of citizens; but whi'fl she pofleefls the

Supposing for an iuftant, what I can by no
means admit, that such is the present situa

the management bf public concerns, thus to
expefe the failings of his brethrenâthe wreak

We have not forgotten the fin* theme, which
the precious confejjions of your countryman

we not exert every muscleâdrain every nerve,

when those who now basely fawn by her fide,

CONGRESS.
t â i,,
HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES,
IVtJnefdtty, Alay 18.
Mr. Coit moved that a Standing Commit
tee of rrvif.il and upfittifhed business be ap
pointed.
Mr. Hartley hoped such a fommittee
would not be appointed, as, if all the unfirtifh
ed business of lad feifion were to be reported
and afted upon, the fclTion would be pru
trafted to a length which he truded was not
the with of the members ef that house.
Mr. Coit observed, that the appointment
of such a committee did not infer that the
house would go into the confidcration of all
the unfir ifhed business which might be re
ported j but there might be some fuhjefts
which would require attention, particularly
any laws which might be about to expire.
Mr. Thatcher was opposed to the appoint
mei't of this committee ; he was agailt at
tending to any private business ; he wished
only to attend to the important fubjeft for
which they had been called together. As to
any laws being about to expire, he did not
believe there were any, as all fcich were at
tended to lad fifli >n.
Mr. Giles thought there was no neceflity
for this committee. He thought the question,
however, of some importance, as the decision
upon it would (hew whether rhe house in
tended to attend to ordinary bnfinefs, or
merely to that which would arise from the
.Speech of the Piefident For his part, he
wished to gc: away as soon as poflible, and,
therefore, to confine their business to that
fubjeft upon which they were called tÂ» de
liberate ; and though the Speech contained
a variety of import .nt objefts, he hoped they
fh iuld soon be able to get through (hem.
He hoped, therefore, no bufir.efs would be
taken up until that was disposed of.
Mr. Sitgreaves said, the opposition to the
appointment of this committee was totally
without objeft. It should be recollefted, he
said, that the appointment of this committee
was a part of the (landing rules of tN* House;
unless it vere appointed, therefore, there
would be a contravention of a rule [Mr.. S.
read the rule}. For his own part, he was
net prepared to fay, with the gentleman
from Maffachufe ts (Mr. Thatcher) that
there wete no laws which Wv<uld expire be
fore the ntxt feflion of Congress It was
true, that these had been attended to lad
feflion ; but it was also true, that laws which
were passed for a limited time, were said to
be for so long, "and until the end of the next
feflion of Congress and this feflion, being
an extraordinary one, might put a period
to some of such laws. But, suppose this
were not the cafe, what mifchief, he asked,
could the appointment of this committee
effeft ? He could fee none. It would, by
reporti. the unfinifhed business, and any
expiring laws (if such there were) take the
trouble of enquiry from the house ; and,
when the business was reported, any part of
it might be taken up, or not, as the house
should determine. It might, therefore, be
of some advantage, but could be of no disad
vantage to appoir.t this committee.
Mr. Coit said, his principal objeft in the'
motion he had made, was to attend to ex
piring laws. The gentleman from Maffachu
i'etts was mistaken, when he averted no law
would expire before the next meeting of
Congress. One he resollefted ; there might
be others. It was a law palled May 6, 1796,
relative to Revenue Cutters, which was to
remain in force for onejyear.and from thence
to the end ofthe next feflion of Congress;
of course tt would expire, if no provision
was made to prevent it, with this feflion.
Mr. Thatcher withdrew his objections to
the motion.
Mr. Giles did not know that the appoint
ment of this committee would protraft the
feflion ; but if gentlemen attended to lhÂ»
duties of this committe, they would find,
that if the house were to attend to all the
fubjefts upon which they were to report, it
would of neceflity occupy a eonliderable
length of time. [He read what these were.}
If, indeed, it were underdood, that thiscom
mittee was only to extend to expiring laws,
he should have no objection to its being ap
pointed ; but, should a general repott be
made, and the house aft upon it, the feflion
would be extended to a period beyond what
any member contemplated.
Mr. Hartley hoped the committee would
not be appointed, ss he said there wete from
goto TOO private cases on the lift of unfinifh
j ed business, to consider which would make
a long fefTton. If it were intended merely
to enquire what laws were expiring, he would
agree to it ; buTnot otfierwife. The rules
which wete before them, he said, we.ee in
tended only for their Ordinary annual feflions,
and not to govern an extraordinary meeting
; like the present. If this comirittee were ap
pointed, they might proceed to the appoin
! ment of a committee of claims. He hoped
they should not decide any thing, before they
had disposed of the President's speech.
Mr. Nicholas hoped this business would
be fettled fa as to meet the wishes of the
House. He hoped a committee would be
appointed and afterwards discharged from
all other parts of their duty except what re
lated to expiring laws.
The queition being put it was carried,
there being 5J votes in favor of it ; and a
committee of three wete appointed ac
cordingly.
Mr. Nicholas then moved that the eommittee
be discharged from" examining and reporting
from the journal of last si fiion, all such matters
as vrere then depending and undetermined, and
alio from revifiug the liws for the eflablifhraeut
of offices, and from reporting from time to time
such provifious and expense attending them, as
naiy appear to have tieoome nectfiary."
Mr. Gilei fecended the motion. The only
obje&ion which he had to this procedure wa9
that it was rather aukward firft to appoint a
Somm'ttec, and then to it froiVi great
part of its duties ; but having appointed tke
committee, he hoped this course would be tak
en, as gentlemen would recoiled! bow easy it
was to glide from one step of business to anoth
er, which was not at full intended, when so
much lay before them.
Mr. Craik wis not prepared to fay that- it
would be improper to ait upon atiy of the un
finilhed business of last session. He felt a< strong
a difpolition to make the present feffioii a ihort
one as other gentlemen ; but to enable them to
dojthc bufmefs properly, he thought the best way
would be to fuller this committee to take the
whole cf it before them, as it wds not in the
power of individual members to go over the
journal of last session, and l'av wh t was necei
farytobe gone into. Upon a view of the fub
jedt, there might be measures which it would
be elFential to have a<sled upon ; and, after the
report was made, the Houle would not be obli
ged to take up any things which it did not think
necefTary, and therefore no inconvenience could
result from it.
Mr. Swanwick said, whatever might be the
decision of the House upon this queltion, there
was one cafe which he thought in some degree
connedled wi,h the fubjcdl of the President's
Speech, which he wished to be considered. It
>*asthe cafe of North & Vefey of Charleston,
merchants, who prayed for the refunding of
certain duties. There were circumstances in
this"cafe, he believed, which were infringements
of exilting treaties.
Mr. Giles said, if they gave way to business
of this liort they might expedt to fit all the sum
mer, as every member had business entrufled to
him which he thought of the tirft importance.
He hoped they should attend only to the bulintfs
upon whtch they were called.
Mr.Swanwick hoped, if the present motion
were agreed to, an exception would be made in
fÂ»vor of the cafe he had mentioned.
The Speaker said the exception would not be
in order.
Then, âMr. Swanwick added, â He Ihould
vote against the motion. As he looked on this
bulinel's as of the fir ft importance, and ihat
whillt we were attending to our own rights, we
ought, in some degree, to refpefl those of other
nations.
Mr. Macon said, it was of little consequence
how the matter was determined, since, if the
motion <was carried, it would be in the power of
any two members to bring forward any lubjedt
they plea fed. He thought it would be best to
determine to do no private business at ail.
Mr. Hartley oblerved that if any private cafe
were taken up, none deserved attention) more
than tint of Mn. Carmichael.
Mr. Nicnolas knew that it was in the power of
any two membeis tÂ® bring forward any private
business, and, if they could perluade the house to
doit, to have it decided: but be concluded, if this
vote pa fig , all such attempts would be in Tain.
The question wa> put and carried without a di
vision. *
Mr. Swanwick then wished the House to resolve
itlelf into a committee of the whole en the (late of
the Union, in order to take up the President's
speech.
Mr. Giles obferyed that this would be prema
ture, since the President had promised tlieÂ»i cer
tain papers which were not received, and they had
yet to determine upon an a- fwer to his speech.
Mr. Williams said, perhaps the business would
be best expedited hy an adjournment, since it would
allow the gentlemen on the committee appointed
tor the purpose, time to pr pare an anlwer to the
Speech, and report it the earlier.
He made a motion ts that effedt, which was

president's MESSAGE, JAN. 19, '97.
Letter from Mr. Fauchet to Mr. Randolph.
(Continued from tVednefday's Gazette.)
I hare gone over in detail the different
point* Hated in our correspondence ; let us
return to that part of your letter which con
siders the neutrality of the United States.
I conceived, fir,, that the refpedt and cir
cumfpedtion with which I had touched on
this qfleftion, would have spared me tha bit
ter rcfledtions which your letter appears to
contain on that matter. However great may
be my desire to enter into details for my own
defence, yet I (hall wave them, from the
fame motives which didated my firft letter.
But, \ fir, if these fentiraents had net been
with me so weighty, I could at lead take off
the veil which you seem willing, to leave over
the measures of the English, and refute the
application of the principle upon which you
ground the silence of the government of the
United States on thefubjedtof these measures.
I might make it doubtful whether jhe arbi
trary proclamations of the English govern
ment and generals were but the ordinary eh-
JruQions -with which neutral commerce is aj
faihd in all wars. I might in like manner
hesitate to admit that the federal government
had not fufficient grounds to demand their
revocation. But that would lead against my
inclination into an examination of the cases
in which a neutral power Ihould a&ually ac
knowledge the legality of an interruption of
its cotr.milrce, such as those of a place lloci
aded and contraband. I fbould also be obli
ged to examine whether the principles with
which the English government endeavor to '
support itfelf are consecrated by the law of 1
nations, or whether they are not rather efta- 1
| bltfhed 10 serve on the present occasion ; '
whether in changing the language the cabi
net of London has changed its measures jâ
whether the fucceflive orders of the Bth June '
and 6th November 1793, and of the Bth '
January 1794, are not variations of the fame
fyilem, to which the depredations Hill exer- 1
cifed on your commerce, are the sequel; '
whether in a word it is true that the Unite') '
States are fuffcring with all neutral nations
under the fame insults, cr particularly fieri- 1
(iced to eiclufite vexation*. In enumerating t
t | these things, I only remind you of what has
1 ; already come to your knowledge, and trace
| fails against which I know yoil are not less
indignant than-France against whsm rhey are
, specially diredted. The history of your neu
trality would perhaps prove my assertion, that
t it has been a prey to the arbitrary condudt of
- Cjreat Britain, and would have served as a
> jullification as what I might ami (hould re
' present on the fubjedt.
r In fad) from the evidently precaiious Gtua
. tion of the neutrality of America, and from
: the vexations to which she is fubjedted, could
: 1 not (how that tins neutrality i 9 in a violent
â¢ litua 1 ion to which the United States cannot
j consent ; from this violent fit nation would I
not have reason to infer the neefflity of an
energetic and vigorous reatfion and of a f<Â»-
Icmn reparation, which b) giving to America
I what her honor requires would have mini
frfled towards the French republic, the in
clination and intentions of your government ?
I would have remaiked th.it their reparations
had been announced at a certain period, but
that if public report were believed they ap
peared as far off as ever. From this contra
dilution between the promises and the perfoim
ance of them, this consequence fecms toarife,
that the United States had not yet ellablifhed
their neutrality upon as a rcfpedtable a foot
ing as France desired and had inftrufied me
to demand : I was going to conclude that
your government had not done in this refpedt
every thing in its power, arid feared lelt this
backwardness Ihould arise from a lukewarm
nefs towards its antient ally, who has not
ceased, on the contrary, to tcility to it how
much she desired to fee the bands which con
nedt the two- csuntries brought closer to
gether. This idea fuggefls to me a refleflion
that the frtendlhip profeffed by the United
States towards our republic of which they
haveon several occasions repeated assurances,
does not peimit them to alter their situation
towards our mod mortal enemies, to our djf
advantageand amidlt hortilities, theorigiivof
which u .doubtedly take date from the
pendence of America
These remarks which I have iong revolved
iD my mind, led me, Sir, accidentally to
speak to you of the treaty in my letter of the
2d of May ; but feeling all the circumfpec
tion which the silence observed on that adt
prescribed, I only presented doubts to you,
and did not even imagine that the manner in
which I wrote to you would have given rife
to acontroverfy between us. Besides, Sir,
j Â»t would luperfluous for me at present to com
mence such a fubjeft with you. I there
fore close by appealing, specially to the at
tention of the federal government upon
points which truly interest the i-'reneh re
public, to witâthe energetic and liberal exe
cution of her treaties with the United States,
and the support of their neutrality upon a re l
peSable footing towards and againfl all. J
conceive it my du'y to point out a thing as
infinitely defirsble ; which is that nothing
definitively be concluded as to the treaty sub
mitted for ratification of the Senate,until my
successor who is mtimently expedled fhaP
have communicated to you the inftruftions
which without doubt he has received upor
that important fubjedl. I conjure you Sir,
to submit this reflection immediately to the
President.
I have but one word more to fay, Sir, on
therlofe of your letter, in whiJi you recti:
to contrails between the present and the past
I cannot believe that the Piefident had me
in view when you inlinuate on his part thai
endeavours are (till making to injure the bar
mony exifling between the two nations. 1
do not think that any one has ever givefi
greater evidence than myfelf of a sincere dc
I fire of cultivating it. Still less can 1 admit
notwithllanding some of your expressions.
that your objedt was toinfpire me with fea>
as to the the manner in which I have conduc
ted. You know well, Sir, that a public
man who from any personal cpnfideration
wlia'foever (hould compound with his duty
would be unworthy the confidence of his
country.
Accept, Sir, rfly esteem,

Fauchet,* Mini Her Plenipotentiary of the
French Republic.

Sir,
I HAVE not been able to aeknowledge
sooner your letter of the Bth, inflant, which.
I had the honour of receivingon the fame
day.
If the plan, pursued in mine of the 29th
ultimo, be more extensive, than the one pro
posed in yours of the 2d, you will afcribt
thr enlargement of it to my solicitude to
remove every diflatisfadtion, felt by the
miniller of our ally. A part, however, of
that plan being to colled) with fidelity thr
fadts, applicable ta your various charges, an J
to comment upon them with candor, I dial:
not relinquilh it, in now replying to the old
or new matter of your last letter. But I
mufl be pardoned, if 2 pass over without
much flrefs, any general declarations, which -
are not fufceptiblt of a precise argument.
For how fliall t defend our government

" That pofitivc engagements, which give
" France a right to certain privileges, have
" beeo neglected or executed with indiff;r
---" ence : that other rights, common to all,
" have become doubtful, for you by too
" much fubmiflion to the adla of other
" powers : that you could cite a great
" number of examples : that it will be easy,
" more at leisure to have a colledtion made
"of them in tbe different consulates: that
" almost all the prizes have been fubjedted
" to artifices : and that one of the most dif
" agreeable parts of your functions has been
" to reply to the just complaints of your in
" jured fellow citizens," &c.

- the French republic would prefer, their good

s The new arrangements against which yoÂ«
â¢ have exprefTed ynurfclf, are a part of the
great fubjeft, which is now at the disposal
r of the Senate.
There are some miscellaneous matters,
which remain to be touched briefly.
1 We agree to submit the conltruftion of
'7 th article of this treaty ro explanations
between the two governments. But in the
mean trme I mull own, ihat I do npt feel
the importance of Mr. Hammond's acknow

tended, th&t under our treaty with France,
we could not expel the prizes made by the'

gument reminded him of a conltr lift ion
which we had adopted refpeftiâg the efuiferj

non wsuld be defea'ed. You do not fcrm

and our harbours may swarm with tjt'em. If

whether a British minister reasons well or ill â¢
though I do not Â»eoÂ«lleit. that he has repeat'

e.iiy to find a leaning Â«r fubfervi'ccy to G.

itrorgly demohftrates the propriety of my

NEW-YOKK, May 16.
The demand on the Hanfe TÂ»wns to (but
British veflels from t eir ports, confirms what
wefuggefted some weeks agÂ«, that the French
find it neceflary to cut off all diretfl and eify
communicatien between Great Britain and the '
Emperor, which is now by the way of the Elbe. ;
At this particular junilure, that step is fuppol- !
ed to be extremely neceflary towards embarraf- â¢
ing the operations of the limperor, in the ap- j
proaehing campaign. Whether the French ;
will really fend f.n army to effefl their objeils, is s
not certain ; butfarfrom improbable.
The conduit of Fra ice towards Denmark <
and the Hanfe Towns, defeats all the reasonings
of our Jacobins, who afcribt her treatment of
us to the treaty with Great Brita n. Hamburgh
has made no late treaty with Great Britainâ
France has made no complaints on that fuhjeift.
Yet France treats Hamburgh as ill as the Unit
ed States. Such pretences as these are all non- !
fcnfeâmere hypocrisy to cover the plan of def- :
troving a rival and eltablilhing a controling in
fluence over the whole worldâprinciples that
ought to be, and will be refilled by all the nor
thern powers of Europe, and by the United
States.
" The Gazetteer of America," a new and
interesting u ork, by Rev. Dr. Morse, is in the
prefsand will be publifbed the beginning of June. \
We have seen and examined a large portion of j
.this work in mmufcript, and can aflure the .
public that it will be a most valuable volume. ]
Indeed it will be the firft publication of the kind
that deserves the name of an American Gaxet- j
teer. The volume will contain 600 pages, and |
contain a complete description, not only of the j
towns, cities, &c. in the United States, but in j
South America and the Weft Indies.
The following are the conditions of publica- |
tion. ...
1. The work will contain, as neai ,y as can be
estimated, about 600 pages large oftavo, fine
print, on a new and Â»ea f type.
2. The work will be printed on three differ
ent forts of paper, to accommodate the tastes
of fubfenbers. Copies printed 011 paper of the
firft quality, will be delivered to fubferibers, ele
gantly bound in calf, at three dollars eaeh. Co
pii s of the iucond quality, will he neatly bound
in calf plain, and delivered to fubfciibers at two
dollars and Jifty cents. Copies of third qua
lity, neatly hound in sheep, at twdmollars It
will be optional with the fubferibers. when the
work (hall be completed, to take their books of
the firft, feccnd or third quality, at the above
prices. The prices will be enhanced to non-Jub-
J'c fibers.
3. The Work will be illustrated with fix
MAPS, handsomely engraved, viz. Of the
Northern States*âof the Southern States âof
North America âof South America âof the
Wejl Ind.esâand of the ne<ui difco-verti I/lands
in the Pacific Ocean, of which a particular de
scription is given in the work.
4. Those who will fubferibe, or procure fub

view of the eonftitutiqns of the fever al slates ;

It is very eoncife, and the points of nnion and
contrast in the constitutions are placed before
the reader in a clear and intelligible view.
The work has another excellence, not com

â  â¢â¢ The call for the meeting of CongreHi on

unplcafaot and alarming. What will be the

I feci fonwtimes full of refentmrnt, hut it is tl

and corrupt. An interruption and eventu- C(
ally an annihilation ol our recent happiness fr

precated, should it even be efft&ed by the
hand of an enemy.â But when this evil is
accelerated, and in part accomplished by citi

" May it p'eafe your majesty,
" We, your majesty's most taithfnl and loyal

I and with the most awful appiehenfions trom 1
your majesty's mimfters per6fting in measures
which an accumulation of unprecedented cala- ,
mities has manifeftly proved unwise and def
tru&ive, immediately tending to pervert, and
j even to destroy, the acknowledged principles of
: our juflly boafled eonflitution.
| "We lament that, by the evil instigation of
1 your majesty's advisers, these nations have been
plunged into a war unparaleled in misery and
deftrudlion, which has nearly ruined our com
me ce, irnpoverithed our manufacturers, depop
ulated our country, sapped the public credit,
?nd widely extended the most flagitious corrup
tion.
I "We most deeply deplore that your majef
| ty'S ministers, abandoning the principles they
I once profeffed, have endeavored to prevent the
t remonstrances of yonr people, attacking the
I' very vitals of our constitution, and depriving
your fubjeits of liberties which their antcftors
with so much energy " claimed, demanded, and
infilled on as their undoubted right and inheri
tance," and which it is our duty to tranfmlt to
our posterity pure and inviolate, and for the de â¢
fence and prefervatiort of which, your majesty's
royal house was chosen, and placed upon the
throne of tnefe realm.*.
" We therefore moll humbly betiech yaur
majesty to dismiss forever from your majesty's
' presence ar.d councils, those adviters, both pub
lic and secret, of the measures we lament, not
r doubting that, by a change of councils, such
measures may be adopted as will speedily pro

j duce such a system of economy as (bill rellore

BOLOGNA, Feb. 18.
It is aiTerted here that the Pope, by a secret
article in his peace with the Fren:h, has ceded '
hi, rights ol fuvereignty to Benevento, in the '
kingdom of Naples, in favor of his Sicilian ma- <
je.'iy.
It has been hitherto supposed, that the cess
ions of territory made by the Pope would be in
favor of the Cifpadan republic ; but, contrary
to expe<HaMon, we find that he has yielded his
rights to Bologna, Ferrara, and Romagua, in'
favor of the French republic : we therefore now
belong to France ; and the independence of our
new republic is as yet doubtful.
The territory which the Pope, in his late
treaty, has c.ced to she French, viz. Bologna,
Ferrarr, Romagna, and for the present Ancona,
amount to more than a fourth part of his itates.
FRONTIERS OP ITALY, March t.
Two powerful armies are now colleifling on
the frontiers of Italy. Both the French and
Auftrians have brought the choicest of their
troops from the armies on the Rhine to Italy.
The Auftri ins have already or< accord
ing to others, 70,000 fighting men 011 the river
Piava, and about ao,ooo in the Tyrol, without
reckoning the riflemen, or the reinforcements
which areon their way from the Austrian states
to Friuli, and from the Empire to Tyrol. To
this formidable army, report, though a repirt
which requires confirmation, adds 70,000 Ve
netian troops, as it is said that Venice has at
length determined to take an ailivepart in the
war, and join the Auftrians.
The French have likewise greatly augmented
their force on the frontiers of Italy. The troops
I from the armies the of Rhine and the Meufeare
arrived : a body of 18000 men is ported in re
; serve fromCharnberi, 111 Savoy, to the Mifanefe j
and two divisions are on their way to the place
of adlion.
The archdske Charles has again returned to the
army in Italy, and Gen. Buonaparte has joined
; the French main army from Bologna.
I A ftrious aflion again took place in the Ty- .
j rol, on the 24th of February. The French
attacked the AuftriaHs near Teutfchmetz, in
three different points, in the hope of carrying
Salurn,and entrenching themselves there, before
the Austrian troops from the Rhine (hould ar
rive. They were, however, repulsed with cou
fiderable loss. The Auftrians purlued them to
Monte Corona, drove them from the entrench
ments they had thrown up there, and made
themselves masters of that important post.
