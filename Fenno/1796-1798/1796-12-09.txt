- Mr. Cowan, . . -
YOU will oblige a correspondent by mlerting
the following extract of, and remarks on, an address
of the Executive of the French republic, to the
Spanish nation. 0 |
it Ancient an<? natural allies of France, dtgnihec
r " people, generous and loyal nation, &c. Sec.
'â¢ We have not both of us the fame form of go-
. Â« vtnmtnti France is forever a republic, and you
Â» have placed in the hands of a fugU man, the au-
| <> gufi elcpofst of year latut. But it is not the refem-
<â  S/anct of conjlitutions that forms between two na-
" /inns the firmefl political tie : the truest and bell
" alliance consists in their national interest*, aid
" above all, in the honourable profeflion of the <â 
" fmne principles of morals, loyalty and umverfal
' " joftfee, Sic. 1 ' cc
In the golden days of Genet and Fauchet, the
. rtverfe of this dodrfne was held up to our citizens
3 as the only found faith. It was the interest of
France to, inspire oar citizens with such a hatred a
gain 11 all monarchies, as to indispose them to endure
any. fort of conned ion or treaties with crowned
heads. It was the interest of the French to pre
vent the United States from fettling their disputes
with Great-Britain, because, as she wished us to
I make a â¢ common cause" with her in the war, (he
, naturally saw a greater profped of bringing us to
join in the war, while the old dilputes with
o land werq unsettled, than in a (late of things where
'in these difference* (hould be amicably adjafled hy
treaty. Her minifteis and her minions of course
Â° 7 attempted to dired the nation's will, by propagat- '
o ing political sentiments and dogmas, co-operative
0 rowards views upon this country. A favourite
7 piinciple among these abfti aft philolophcrs was, that P
republic! ought not to form auy treaty of amity or e
commerce with Hogs t and that, refcmblance in forms
of government was the best basis of friendfhip, al
-4 liance and intcreourfe between nations. We now
* perceive, that as it became the interest, so it was
the avowed policy, nay, theory, of the French di-. P
re&ory tÂ® propagate a different fentirncnu In the .
1 address, they set out with the proportion, that
4 though France is a republic, and Spain a raonar
-2 chy, in which the king i> " the aoguft depoflt of ln
* the laws," it is not a refeuiblance of conjlitutions that
forms between two nations the firmefl political tie.
Thus, it isfaid, and so it will be with us, as long
3 as we are prone to accept as proper, those fenti- P'
A ments which the Biitirtl or the French find it con- P :
yenient to inspire. Common reason will tell eveiy
'* man, that every nation has enough to do to take P'
care of itfelf: and a very small knowledge of po
io litict is fufficient to convince every man, that inter- F.
6 efi is the great objed of every government on earth. P 1
' 7 The above dodiine, as laid down by the diredory tc
of France, U a Angular demonstration, added to ""
>6 other proofs, of the danger we run in greedily em
>6 bracing foreign dogmas. Many people were, for 1
!* some time, diftradedly delighted with tlubs and
.5 fraternity } and some were almost enamoured of the
' guillotine. These, and fomc better and wiser thai u
>7 these, adopted the principle, that a republic (itauld
hold no friendfhip, no treaty with a monarchy '
All this delufivc fanaticifm, and, in many, this '
, 0 philanthropic error, will, if they proceeded from ''
[2 imitation of the French, ccafe, when the rotation of'
la every year for three years patt, has brought for. '
ward, for fre(h imitations, modes of political faith,
direftiy the reverse of such as had, like a dress, f '
~ been a little while belore in vague, and are now t!
out of fafliion. Clubs are now abolilhed in France, l '
not as here by contempt, but by law. "Refem- 1
33 blance of constitution" is not now the>beft tie be- J
tween nations in France ; and we find our good ally 1
Jq and fitter republic, drawing closer the bonds of ami
;c ty and eternal friendfhip with her good and " na- 1
57 tural Â«lly" the kind of Spain ; who, "king, is "
very well: but ar. the fame time,' thir;">.Ugufi: de
posit of the laws, is, by hereditary "-titfe, one of 8
J the In;ii\ abfulute misters of his fubjefts that our a
3.3 ' republican filler could have found in Eurbpe. J
j France is right in. so doing, if her interest leads
s Â° her to it. All that can be inferred is, that the U- (
j nitre) States have the fame right, when their inte
rests leads them; and that Frantt, or her roiuiiler )
$o here, k t<i have no pretence to objed to the c*ercife 1
of it, so long as we so exercise it an not lo violate J
the rights of France.

35' GENERAL PICHEGRU'S' CAMPJIGNS. ]

10 This very interesting tfork contains a number of
curious anecdotes, a few of which we have ex- (
traftcd.
50 s 1
Ina briik engagement which took place between 1
33 ; Cotirtray and IngeimtinÃer, the 20th regiment of <
12 cavalry {offered their cannon to be takm. Gene- 1
ral Pichegru gave orders that neither this regitnent, :
â to nor any other that thou};! lose their cannon, should â 
60 be fnpplied with any till they had taken an equal
mimtxr from the enemy. Within three days after 1
thisutrarr, the 20th regiment took four pieces frem
the enemy. ;
90 In the engagemont between Moreau'sdivilion and
troops, near Lincclles and Blaton, fifty ]
ef the enemy's hyfe made their way into out park 1
of artillery. Some B c 'gian recruits, who were left <
to guard the park, threw down their arms and fled.
Our cannoneers snatched up their rmilken, and plarv I
â¢ l 7 itJ lUemUlues the amÂ«uÂ»iitloii waggons, fi
red upon the troo'pers, and killed several, and ton
â¢pelled th<f remainder to take to flight. This pre
sence of mind saved the artillery of that division on
*â (9 this occasion. ,
During the siege of Ypres, a (hell fell on the :
knapsack of a soldier of the second battalion of La
ct. Conezf, which cut the (traps of his knapsack, and
'Â»r. a pot of batter that he had placed above his
nec<JTafiej. This volunteer, who was a native of
Liinoufin, was not at all affected by the danger,
but, looking eagerly at the fragments, cried in his
provincial dialed, " Ah I grand Di, mourt toupide

giment of Latojir, which is one of the fined rai
ment of dragoons in the Emperor's service, adÂ»a n .
ced along the road, covered with their cloaks. The
chief of this defni brigade, not feeing the uniform
of the Auftrtans, thought it waÂ» a detachment of
our cavaljjjr ; *ud when his njes' were preparing to
fire, he eried, " Stay, (lay, I think tbey belong , 9
11s." The commanding officer of the dragoons an.
fwe red, 'Yes, we are Trench. But what do you
do in that dangerous position ? You will have the
whole army of the enemy upon yon. Take n r
advice and change your position.' Ai he finiM
these words, he discovered his uniform. Our offi
inilantly gave orders for his men to fire, and i
sharp engagement ensued. An entire (quadron n f
the enemy were '.eft on the field. The road *3.
covered with the carcaflcs of men and horses. The*
carnage wai (hocking.
Through the whole of this campaign our bifan
try flood the shock of the cavalry with perfect ft ca *
dinefs. There was no aharge in which ihey were
broken or thrown into confufion. This is the in
credible steadiness of pur foot soldiers, which haa
made our armies invincible. Its conduit will f orm
a period in the history of military tranfaftions.
The moment the infantry fuffer tbeicJelves'tobt
broken by the horse, they expose thetnfelves to be
Â«ut to pieces But if they have the courage to
main firm, they feldorn or ever fail of gaining the
advantage. TJie cavalry of the enemy have often
beeh fcen to charge our foot,on the full gallop. The
firfl rank of infantry difcharjred their mulkets and
presented their bayonets. The second and third
kept up a constant fire, and the horses were com
pelled to retire with loss. If our battalions had fuf
fered themselves to be broken, the cavalry would
have made a terrible carnage, and we could have
fuccceded in no enterprise.
Gafpard Thieric, colonel of the 9th regiment of
Hll (Triis, was reconnoitring with his regiment; Â»aiL^
placing feme LroÂ»pÂ«Â«~ In-u STftTJow way,
he propofsd to draw the eaemy into it, by provok
ing them to a&ion, and afterwards flyinjr before
them. He ordered his hussars to insult the enemy
in every possible manner. They accordingly advan
ced pretty near the Auflrians, calling ihem the
(laves of despots, and giving them such other names.
The abuse was returned by the enemy, who re
proach* J our troops with being compelled to take
paper food, with killing their king, and me'ting
down their church-bells. Tbey, mean while, fnf.
pcfled the snare, and could Bot be tempted to move.
One of our hussars, at length, losing all patieoce,
galloped up and killed an Austrian trooper with a
pistol (hot; but the enemy, instead of being drawn
to seek revenge for this insult, cried out Bravo !

A hussar of the 9*h regiment, whose name was
Petre, was sent to a village itj'-Brabant, to protect
| the inhabitants from marauders. A party of these
I entered the place, and fcarchinjr for concealed efÂ«
fefts, dug up a small box, in which all the inhabt
, tants of the village had deposited their money. Pe
! tre arrived at the very moment when they were car
fi i"ying Â°ff their booty, and drawing hii fÂ»bre, by his
intrepidity and firmnefs, he induced the plundered
to take to,-flight. He called together the inhabi
' tants, who opened the box in hiÂ« presence. Itcon
' tained ninety thousand livres, and Petre was desired
to take what he pleased from it. Petre thanked
' them, and only added " I have done my duty, and
you owe me nothing, but 1 would advise you to
' hide your money better in future."
It rarely happened that the emigrants fuffeted '
themselves to be taken alive, especially in any great
numbers. The brigade of Jourdau, however, took
S Putty-fix belonging to the Legion of Rohan, the
r greater pertot whom were convi&ed of emigration
and condemned to be (hot. Among them was a
young man from the Department of the Pas-de-Ca
lais, who declared lie had been diiven to quit his
' counijf on tie grea;elt extremity, and to escape
from the fury of Lebon. He heard his fentencfi
with of an innocent man ; and hav
' ing begged pcrmifliâ¢ Jo w.ite to his brother who
C was serving among the Emigrants, he expressed
e hirafclf on tbciÂ»ax in " De "J

of all crimes is to bear amis against our tommy.
,f After we had entered Nimeguen, it happened
that I was.left alone at the head quarters. A beau
tiful woman, accompaniÂ«3 by her maid servant, en
.l tcred the room in which I fat, and with marks of
if extreme terror, threw her arms round my neck and
cried. " Dear General, I hope they will hot fne
t. any more bombs on the town." "No madam,
d wc arc now mailers of it."-" But will not the
Â»] English fire upon us "I do uot think they

II She fell senseless, being quite overcome with fear,
and when (he came to herfelf, (he told me that fe

The Address of his Majesty's Council. T
May it please yout Excellency, tl
We his majesty's most dutiful and loyaj fubjefts, tc
the council of Bermuda, beg leave before your ex- C c
cellencj't departure, to exprefc the sincere regret
we feel for your excellency's removal frem the go- 0 I
vernment of these islands. The immediate causes Â«â¢
ef that removal we arc but little acquainted with, r<
and we wish not, nor would it indeed become uÂ», C i
to take the liberty of enquiring very particularly c Â«
into them ; but we nevertheless cannot refrain upon
the present oecafion, from rr plating the folcmn de- tc
elaratiens we have already made to your excelien. si,
ey, that tne Jacobinical principles imputed to you, hi
and thfdifaffeflion yÂ»u are fatd to havie been ac
Â» tufed of entertaining towards our admirable confti
t lit ion, are charges, in our opinion, so totally
greundlefs, that they could only have been dictated tl'
by the most inveterate and rancorous enmity. We /
flatter ourselves, however, and it is our earned
prayer, that the clouds which now hang over your
excellency, may soon be dispersed, and that they
may be faccecded by better and brighter profpefls, Â£
-âpersuaded as we ate that your excellency hat
conscientiously discharged the trust icpofed ia
you by our most gracious sovereign, and that you f v
have made his majesty's ferrice and the prosperity t(
of this country the sole rules of jour admioiftra- f (
tion, we have every reason to hope, and believe,
that (his mÃ!t be the cafe. n

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Coijncil, j|
I beg yon will accept my sincere thanks for the â  a
â¼fry kind address you have done me the honour to a
present to me oa my departure. The regret you
exprefson that occasion, will be to any perfont ac
qnainted with your charaEteis, a sure proof, that I f
have been afhiated in my whole condnft in this K ov -J /
eminent, ! zeal for the king's service, and an eat nelly
desire to promote the prosperity cf thrfe islands.//
In whatever light fomc wicked perfbn may con
tri?e to repreftnt my conduct to his mÂ»jefty's mi
nisters, yet I rely with confidence for redress on t
the benign virtues of the Wing, on the integrity
and love of j'jftice which lam persuaded govern j
thcselionÂ» of his misifters, although they appear j
in my cafe to have the misfortuae to have been de
ceived and led into error. L
'â¢Â» I shall always remember Â»he council of Bermuda h
with fentimentt of unfeigned esteem and regard,
and (hall, wherever I may be, feel a warm imereft
in wha'ever concerns the welfare of the inhabitants
of these islands.

COMMUNICATIONS. 1
The Demos speak with, bitter contempt of the
do&rineof checks and balances. When the peo j r
pie choose their officers, what need is there of [
checks ? It is folly for the people to check them- '
selves ! Not less than JOO columns of this frothy '
r.otifenfe have been dr'awn up in b?.ttle array in the
Chronicle aad Aurora against our batjneed confiitu
tion. Instead ot arguments, it may nnfwer for
once, to quote against these ce
elaimers â One governor claims a didretion against
the letter'of a law so extensive, as to become aJmoil 1
if not quite the arbiter and absolute disposer of rhe e
election of a President ; and he piaftifes according
to hit claim. Anuthei governor steps into the fe r
crcfary't office, where the aÂ£ls and laws of the J
(late are depoii ed in their fupp >feti inviolable f*ne- a
tuary, and detaces a law by feiatrhing out his name. '
The legislature of a southern ftata go beyond even *
thitj they actually taakt a tlieirlaws and .
iccprdt, and join with a mob lu huzza over the '
conflagration.
*: do these faSi conÃin the f<m>eth opiniu:- !
ef the Demos that offic crs chosen by the pcOjlh' j '
wilj do right wiihost checks in the fyftcrn of go- 1
vernment ? Or are not Come further guardt and fe- '
curities over and above firr.ple popular cle&ion oe
ceffary to prevent such outrages ? '
Not a bene. Tbe Democrats united their fuffrages
to make this fcratcbing governor an Elector of Pre. '

whom the said White hacj apprehended.
| Mr. Foster did not know that these petitioners
â  were entitled to any relief, but would mow that the!
positions (hould be referred to the committee off i n f
claims. The Speaker informed that no such com-f
mittee at present ekifted, he moved that a commit
tee of claims (hould be appointed, which was done
accordingly. The above petition! were then re
feired to'it.
Mr. Williams mowed a refolutio* to the follow-l Sc
ing effect, which was. agreed to : ( Sli

the aft for Wtablifhing JfcÃ-ofi-es and poll-roads'
wit!\in the United States, and to report by bill orÃt
otherwise." J â¢
The resolution wai agreed to, and a commitieel /'
of mite 'membeis was appointed. J
Mr. W Snoith said, the romrpittee of claimsl
made a repoit op ;Ue c-.fr of Henry K2I too late inl
the lalHfeflion.'to b? taken up. He wished that re-I
port might now be referred to a committee of thclj
whole house. be
Mr. Macon had already observed, that acommitAj w
j tee of revifal and urffinifhed bwfjnefit had been ap I k
pointed, and ]ie thought it would be more regular!
to wait for theitreport, .whieh would of course iaJ _ i(
elude this business. S
Mi. W. Smith di#ne* feÂ«the Â»eceflÂ»ty of wait- ar
J ing for this report. He nderftood that it was the T
. business of the committei of revifal and unfinifhed
' bufipefs, to take cogmfan -eof, and to make report
r 00, such fubjefts as raigh othcrwife elcape the at- ct
: tention of the house, and not to prtelude member*
1 from bringing.forward *ny business on motion.â q
' He believed this had beer the praftiee of the house.
Mr. Macon allowed tl at it had been the p raft ice b;
'of the house to bring forward business of this fdR on It
' motion ; but that a cotimittce of revifal and un- ~
( fini(hed business had beer appointed in order to do
away thepraftice.
8 The Speaker said,' tha the present, with ail o
e ther unfini(hed business, vas sent, or would be feat,
" to the committee already appointed. The house
might however take up tht present report fcparatcly,
but hÂ« did not think it #ould be so regular a* to _
wait for the report of the\ committee.
Mi. W. Smith thoughnthat it would be putting
too much power in the ha ids of such a committee
always to wait their report before an unfini(hed sub-
jest could be taken up. It would be in their power
' greatly to piotraft neeeffai y business. e<
r Mr. Baldwin was of opinion, that if the present
business was not of a parti i-ular urgent nature, it
would be most regular to Ivait the report of the
committee. It Isould mÂ«rt soon, and the report
would doubtless be made fcrarly ; ?nd when it wu
made, the house would of tourfe take up such ob
jects a* were mod piefiing. I
Mr. Williams said, on Anraining the journals, f
i he found that this made a*
Â» early report, and that ther* Jthere
'â¢ incenveaience fuffered in
â¢ A MrJfc-Saiith his' 9iotiÂ«n,.and thÂ«
