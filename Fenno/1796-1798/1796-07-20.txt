Sunday morning, about three o'clock, a most

BARRACKS.
IT appears, that the principal use of thefc edi

(editions doctrines. Abltraftedly considered, it is
a good thing to .keep thÂ« soldiers from being taint

this principle as far as it will go (and a principle
is good for nothing if it be not applicable miverf

Sir, who have. so well described the present scarci

BAD ROADS.
The roads in the neighbourhood of the city have '
been so long neglected as to become a disgrace to '
the country : 1 at present allude to the German
t.Avn and Wiflahicon Roads; which during the
winter were not paflable without the utmolt da - 1
ger ; and at the piefent moment, are fuffered to 1
be full of deep muddy holes, which at a trifling ex
pence, in ditching, might be rendered perfectly I
good without the charge of hor'.es and carts. Near 1
ttre of the r.eu*- unci old Gtrmantown road it 1
became so extremely bad,' that a load of good hay
tt i lately overset in the mud, ;.nd entirely perilh. 1
ed ; but it isfaid that the owner has commenced a '
suit againll the oveifeers for damages. This vile
hole is ivuv meT.ded ; but'there are a number of o
t!'-rÂ» beiw en Mr Norris's grourfds at Fair Hiil,
a d Mailers s mill dam, on the Four h-Street road ;
a d alio on the Wiflahicon road, from the Robin
Hood to Callowhill-Street, which ought to be im
media-ely repaired, and will only require small diljj
ches for drains ; âthe bridge over the mill race of
Mailers's dam, is moll dangerously broken, and
should an accident happrn at this place, very heavy
damages would doubtlefa be given tw the fuft'erer ;
whether it falls under the notice of the overseers or
the ownerrs of the mill, is immaterial:âA little to
the northward of Meredith'stan yardtheie is a moll
fhumcful gully in the road.
The longer thele places are unattended to, the
greater will be the exponce to the town (hip ; and
if the inhabitants ftiffcred no more than in their poc
kets, no traveller or stage-driver would pity them.
On the contrary they would be gl*d to hear that
theexpence was four fold, by way of punishment
for cis.oofingoverfeers so negle&ful of their duty.

t?!!3 town, Coinmaacijfr of-tiir Hnp Ehterprife of
WifcafTet, to the Marine Society of tliia t jwu I
Tenerrffe, March 22.
" I chartered my (hip to Mr. Soien, ef the
houfa of Holy >ke and -Soren of Boilon, for a voy
age from Hamburgh toSu -rinam and back to Harp
burgh, and left the river Eibe on the sth of Ftb'.
'all, andion the 25 h being in lat. 44, 1,
K. long. 18,33, W - at 2 M. saw alar K e (hip in
the S. W. quarter, appearing' to be iri distress
made immediately for her, anrt at 4 P. M. fpokc
her, she proved to be a Britit'h tranfp rt with troops |
on board, fiom Cork, bound to the Well Indies in I
a l.'akly and didreil fihia'ionâbpth pumps coti
(lantly going. She was called the Ifabell, of Liv- ,
erpool, Charles Potter, com-naiiderâCapt. Potter
immediately came on board my_ Ihip and infor:n-d â¢
me of his fitnation, aad requeftei that I (hotild fee ,
him fafe intoCarona or Lisbon, I told him my (hip ]
I was chartered at a very high freight, and that my
Voyage would be very much injured by.goinct bick c
to er her of those placesâbut that 1 was willing a
to fee him fafe into the wetlern Hlands',Madeira, or
she Canaries, and to render him every other service '
in my power, that I was willing to accoinmodatc as .
many of the gentlemen offices, as 1 conrer.ien ly 1
could, and hnd them in any of the aforefaid Islands. h
With this Potter seemed fatisfied and said he belied ;
ved that aiould doâthat he would feud to the com
mander of the troops for his approbationâbut in. ;
(lead thereof, he sent an informal ina that my (hip c t
and cargo was French and Duteh property and of
course a good and legal prize, and requc Â».d imme r
diatc affiilance, which he was soon supplied with,by
an armed party who then drove Mr. Sorcn, mv fu I
percargp, and mv chief mate, with 8 of my sailors
into his boat at the point of the bayanet and lent 1
them 011 board the Ifabell prisoners, all this was
done before Potter had seen any of my papers t
My Chip then being'manned from the Isabel with
an addition of fourteen soldiers, two officers and a
doctor, on the next day, Potter thought it proper
to inform me, chat the ihip Enterpriie was his,and
that he (hould, after arriving at Lisbon difpaich us i,
for Barbadoesâfor he w 9 positively sure t
had a double set of papers, and that the caigo was 0
Dutch and Fiench propertyâafter examining all g
my papers both public and private, taking from me t
my invoice, bills of ladi.g, (hipping paper, clear- <
ance from Hamburgh, and federal others, which he j
thought proper to keep. He then went into the /
hold and broke open several cases and boxesâta t
king out from each what he thought proper and <]
carried them off with him, all this was done in re
tahaiion for my kindness and humanity to himâ f
after our arrival at this port, Potter detained Mr.
S. and my chief mate prisoners two days on board
the Ifabellâand also endeavored to detain ipe a
piifoner on board the Enterprise until- the British
consul who Was then at the Grand Canarie (houh v
arrive, Potter taking the liberty to load the En'er- ,
prifewith baggage (lores and soldiers from bis oid- ;
(hip Ifabell (which is flow condemnÂ«d for'being rot
ten and in danger of fi..king in this road) he iÂ«-dÂ«-
tcr mined to take us to Barbajoes, and there to con â  ,
demn'(hip and oargo, he has taken every means to ]
corrupt my sailors in order to make them swear t
that the ship is either Dutch or French property,
no matter which, for which reason he has kept
them on /hort allowance of bread and water, and ,
has kept my carpenter several days in irons. I t
have had 'he Jplealing fatisfaflion linee our arrival,
to have been in company with every one of the
Briti(h officers, who have declared not only tome â 
but to many of the principal merchants in this <
tyhce, that when Potter boarded my (hip, he sent ,
Â»his boat back and demanded immediate affittaoce,
informing that the (hip and cargo was a lawful prize, ,
â vhen as I before related, he hat) not seen one of my â¢
papers. I cannot fay too much in praise of the com
mander and officers of the Britilh troops, for their kind '
polite and genteel behaviour, to Mr. S. and my '
fhretmate, they speak very highly of the Civilities re
o lved from those gentlemen during their flay on board
the Iflabell. Porter told Mr. S. that I was pofit'rely
aFren hman and that the cargo was also French pro
pertv, and llfo that I was one of the greatest Rafcalj on
earth, and that he had papers lafflcient to-hang me ill
England (a fine reward indeed for fa.ving the lives of
near 300 of his Britaaic fubjeat) at the fame
lime told Mr. S. that he did not think he could con
demn iiis property, only part of the Cheese as being
Dutch Mr. S. quits me here, a.d intends for En
gland, by whom I (hall fend my ptoteft agaiuft Potter :
now Gentlemen, I am confident If juilice akes place on
our arrival at Barbadoesl (hall be acquitted with honor,
licing conscious of not having a liugle paper of any
thing else 011 board of my (hip, that can gainfjfy or con
tradict what I have always profeft myfelf to be, and
what you have always known me to be a citizen of tke
United States of Americaâl (hall write you from Bar
badoes, as loon after my arrival there as I know my
fate it is peculiarly aggravating to rae, to know that
mod of my cargo will be rtiined before a decition takes
place.

until the terms of peaea fiiould be agreed upon, and
that by way ps security the Krench were put in poflef

Sardinia had agreed to the paflage of the French
through his dominions to Lombardy.
The fame day it was agreed, that a commission of
five members ihouid be chosen out of the National

â  The following Chara&er of this work c 0
)r is extrailed from the Monthly Review, p. 311, for
â ' Match, 1793. tic
" We have no small degree of pleasure in announcing
tlicprcfent work to our readers t as one which from the
freedom of itsenquiry, the grandeur of its views, and the
fortitude cf itsprincipl-s, is eminently deserving of atten
n tiof). By this eulogium, we would by no means be under
t- flood to fubferibe to all the principles which these volumes
y contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of T
:s certainty which is requilute, for ttny two men to think ft
is like on all fubje&s; neither has language attained that con
:- fiftent accuracy, which can enable them to convey their w j
:- thoughts, even when they do think alilK, in a manner per- UD
ts feiftly correel and mtslligibde to both. 1 hefe difficulties
are only to be overcome by a patient, inccfiW, and bene
t, volent inveftigatien. "
ic " Many of the opinions wk<ch this worrc contains, arc
>f bald ; some of them arcÂ«"vcl ; and some doubtk-rs are er
roneous but that which ought to endear it even to thofc
n whose it may offend, is the strength of argu
:e ment acUuced in it to prove, that peace and order ir.oft ef
rt fe&ua'.ly promote the happiness after which political re
formers are panting ; âthat as the progress of knowledge
is gradual, political reform ought net to be precipitate;ââ¢
and that convulsive violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that result comparatively would be of small
- account) but to the general cause of trath. It is the pp
pofitecf this principle that infpirei the enemiisof politic
al enquiry with sb much terror ; it is the supposition that
change mull inevitably be attended by the turbulence apd
injullicc of comnaotior.-, and that innovation cannot be
made without t.v: intervention of evils more deftroctive
l j. thau thofc which are intended to be reformed. Under the
,k convi&ion of this philanthropic fentimsnt, of calm and
s- gradual reform, (whichin its proper place "he has fully il
iÃ luflrated) Mr. Godwin proceeds without fcruplefirft t.o en
quire into present evil, through its essential branches, and _
next to demouftrate future good.
