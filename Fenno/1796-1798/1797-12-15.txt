THE Managers particularly rcqucft the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
custom, vrhich has hitherto obtained, ef giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre.
They are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of any wrong done to the interest of the inft'tu
tionby this pradtice, from a general, though raif
taken idea that Checks are the representatives of a
right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
when in fa A, thc-y were never intended as more
than tohtnt by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcertais with the least troubfe to the that
tbey themselves have been before in the Theatre, or
paid for their admiflion.
Independent of the injury the Managers fuflain,
such a practice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other difor Jerly persons to surround the doors of
the Theatre, to the corruption of their morals and
the great annoyance of the Audience.
It has also been thefource of two evils of no ih
confiderablc magnitude; cne is, that fomctimcs
very improper company is by these means admit
ted ; and the other, that owing to Checks pafiing
into diflioneft hands, they have betn frequenaly
counterfeited to a large amount for the purpofesof
Sale.
This ftatemcnt will, it is refpe&fully hoped, in
duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus aflitted,
easily prove adequate to its entire abolition.

CONGR E S S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. I
TUESDAY DECEMBER 12. 1
Debate on a Motion for fu/ptndir.s~icfC opera- I
lion of an A3 of Limitation.
YConcluded from yejhrday's Gazette.)
Mr. J. Williams said, he (hould vote
for the resolution, though he thought it did
not go far enough. The holders of these.
of certificates had been informsd that
the aft of limitation did not reach them ;
they therefore supposed their claims would
never be barred. This being the cafe, he
thought they (hould agree to this resolution,
and leave the holders at liberty to fund
them, since they had evidently been igno
rant of the pafiing of thelaw refpeftingthem.
Mr. Baldwin thought some of the ar
guments on this fubjedt went too far. The
truth was they had not fufficitnt checks to
guafd against frauds. They had for 12 or
14 years been endÂ«avouring to guard against
them. Jf the resolution paired, which per
haps it ought, the suspension should be for
a (hort time ; for though the public were
able to guard against fraud, individuals
would be continually exposed to deceptions,
if this property were fuffered to be long a
float.
Mr. Edmond said, that notwithstanding
all the observations which had ben mjde on
this fubjeft, he could not vote in favour of
the resolution before them. He had heard
no argument fufficient to induce him to let
aside the adl of limitation. They were to
presume that this law was made after due
deliberation. Why, then, repeal it ? Ber
cause it was said, there were certain poor
soldiers, and others, pofTefled of certificates
which were barred by this aft. It was ex
tremely easy to paint the' situation of such
persons in glowing colours. But when they
had paiTed an aft of limitation, they were
not to set it aside for particular cases. This
would defeat the idea of limitation. They
mult, therefore, consider all persons in tHe
fame situation ; whether a person was an
original holder, or had purchased his certi
ficate, was immaterial. The statute had e
qually barred them. Had circumftanccs,
since the pafiing of the aft, changed ? No j
the only reason which bore any colour, was,
that the law had not been fnfficiently pro
mulged. If there hr.d been a negleft on
this head, those who had been guilty of the
negleft (hould redress it. Was it not made
as other laws were made, and promulged in
the fame way ? â¢ But is it said to be incorpo
rated in a lengthy aft, embracing a number
of other articles, and ho reference was made
to it in the margin ; bnt it was comprized
in tne laws of a finglc fefEon, making a fmali
volume, and had beert promulged in the
fame way, in which penal afts which affeft
the lives of individuals, were promulged.â
However the fubjeft might be reasoned up
on, it was said that the faft was, that the
law was little known. It was said there
were members in the house who were not
acquainted with this law. Was this, he
a(ked, an extraordinary thing ? No one sup
posed that every member in the house was
acquainted with every law of the United
â States. The soldier, who probably could
neither write noT read was not supposed to
look after the laws which were passed every
feflion i no, the members of the legislature,
when they return home, take the laws with
them, and give the information to their
neighbours. If they were not thus publi(h
ed, it was owing to a culpable negleft.â
From all'thefe eonfiderations, he thought
the law (hould be preserved.
Mr. Brookes said it was an extraordina
ary doftrine, to fay, that though the mem
bers of the legislature \yere unacquainted
with a law, yet that individuals, who did
not look into a book once in seven years,
(hould be perfeftly acquainted with it.â
What would the people of the United States
think of this ? It had not the femhlance of
jnftice.
Mr. Macon said, on the principles of e
quity, the statutes of limitation might be
looked upon as injurious ; but as no law
had ever been pafled with more notoriety
than the one in question, he could not have
believed, if gentlemen had not themselves
declared it, that it (hould not have been
known to them. It was founded upon the
only report which the Sefretary of the
Treasury ever sent to that house unaflced
for, and it underwent as much debate as any
other law in the United States. These
claims, Mr. M. said, could (land in no better
situation than those of persons who had not
been in the way of getting their claims fet
tled.âWhere both had performed services,
both had the fame equitable claims ; books
were the testimony in both caf*s. If it were
necefiary, therefore, to take these claims of
the statute, it was equally necefTary to repeal
all the statutes of limitation at once. Mr.
M. mentioned an inftatice of fraud which
took place in Rhodc.lfland, by a small sum
being altered to a larger in a certificate,
upon which the interest had been several
times paid,before it was discovered. It was
impoffiblc, he said to guard against frauds.
But he knew very Well that whenever the
claims of a soldier came up, the humanity
and philanthropy of the house were called
upon to afford relief; but 110 difference
ought to be made in favour of one class of
claimants more than another. There had
been a number of hard cases which had been
dec.ded against, from their being barred,
and if they opened the door at all; it (hould
be opened generally.
Mr. Gallatin said, he (hould not have
offered any thing more on the fubjeft, but
for what had fallen from the two gentlemen
last up. There was an essential difference,
he said, between these claims and other's ; it
I *
w . as .ttafe were- liquidated, the others
vfere" unliquidated.. â  In thelatter trfere were
open sq;coijnt3 at the treasury, and if they
were natfettled in a given time, it was riot
pofiibje to check them ; that time had
therefore been limited; but, with fgfpfQ
to ' 'claims, the fame order had
not been taken. They were accounts fet
tled, which never could be expefted to be
barred, aÂ» thg certificate was a fort of nego
tiable note from the government. If this
had not been the view ofof th;e legillature,
why except tbefe claims from the afts of li
mitatioij > It was clear, therefore, that they
stood on quite different ground from the de
scription of claims alluded to. And let it
not be said (added Mr. G.) that the hold
ers of tl\efe certificates ought to be acquaint
ed with the law which affefts these claims.
If the United States owe a debt, which
they do fi6t mean to pay, except presented
before a certain day for fettlcment, it was
their duty so to promulgate the law as that
it (hould be generally known. Much had
been said 6n the score of speculation. He
thought the great zeal which was now (hewn
against speculators, ought to have been brot
into aftion at an earlier period. Ten years
agb the idea of difcrim'm&tiun had been dis
carded, and he thought it too late to intro
dute it now. The gentleman from Connec
ticut (Mr. Smith) had said, it was the du
ty of members who were prefent*at the paf
ling of the law of 1785 to have op posed it
it the time. If the gentleman alluded to
him, he was mistaken, as he was no! 'a mem
ber of the house at the time the aft pafled.
Gentlemen who had spoken against specu
lation had confounded two things together,
viz. persons who had purchased these evi
dences of debt of individuals for a trifle, and
those who had received them in a regnlar
way. It would be perfeftly unjust to put
the latter upon a worse footing than origi
nal holders ; if it were meant only to affeft
1 the former, if the bill could be so modified,
he (hould not objeft to it, though he believ
ed great difficulty would attend the inser
tion o&fuch a provifioitF and he hoped the
motion tvftukl Ue adopted in its present form.
Mr. AlCen wished the committee would
rife, and have fit again. He wan
ted this matter developed ; there seemed
something behind which did not appear ;
it was impofiible that a million of dollars of
this description of debt could lie in the hands
of original holders. This business had only
been introduced this morning, and he tho't
it was not well understood. He wished to
have a littletime forconfideration. He tho't
also, that a new fyflem of morals had been in
troduced on the occasion, which ought to
be examined.
Mr. Brookes and Mr. Thatcher were
opposed to the rising.
Mr. M'Dowe&l was in favor of it, that
gentlemen who wished to speak on the fub
jeft might have an opportunity ; and that
their feelings, which had been worked upon
by highly colouring the fWferings of poor
soldiers, might have time to cool. He
fearedthe certificates in queftion,were chief
ly : .i the hands of other persons-
Mr. Coit had no objeftion to the com
mittee's rising. The sum which had been
dated ai the amount of the class of claims
under consideration was not correftâthat
sum included a number of claims ef a differ
ent kind.
Mr. Gallatin was perfeftly willing
that the commtttee (hould rife ; but not
from the insinuations thrown out by the
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Allen)
that the motion was >vi(hed to be hurried
through the house, or that there was some
thing behind which did not appear. Hav
ing declared he did not know a person who
had one of these certificates, and not hav
ing had any desire for the motion to pass to
day, of course the iufinuation could have no
foundation, as it refpefted him, though he
had introduced the business, and he (hould
be juftified in taking no notice of it.
Mr. Allen said what he meant was, that
certain owners of public paper ef the Uni
ted States had determined not to accep.t of
the terma offered by the government, but
to have (hilling for (hilling ; 'and that this
suspension was intended more to relieve per
sons of this description than poor original
holders.
T}Â»e qucftton on the committee's rising
â  was and carried. They had leave to fit
again. Adjourned.
-JL.
"~WEDNESDAY DECEMBER
Delate on the fubjed of Foreign Coins.
The House being in a Committee of the
whole, the following report of the Seleft
Committee was read.
" That it appears from the best informa
tion they can obtain, tlÂ»t very little of the
silver coin of the United States has circu
lated at any considerable distance from the
Mint, especially in the interior parts of the
country.
" That by tlÂ»e operation of the law which
provided that at the expiration of three
years after the coinage of gold and silver
(hould commence, at the mint, alt foreign
silver coins, except Spani(h milled dollars,
and the parts of such dollars, (hould cease to
be a legal tender : considerable embarrass
ments have already beer, produced, and ma
â ny lwiTes sustained, as a very considerable
quantity Â«f foreign silver coins other than
Spanilh milled dollars, and the parts of such
dollars, was at that time in circulation.
" Your Committee also find, that by the
operation of the said aft, all foreign gold
coins will cekfe to be a legal tender after
thirty-firft day of July next ; that a great
quantity of it is now in circulation, and must
aeceffarily continue so until that period ar
rives, as it will be scarcely possible for the
mint on its present establishment to Gpin a
fuffieient quantity to replace it.
" Your Committee are therefore of opin
ion, that provision ought to be made by
law, authoiifing and requiring the colleClovs
of the revenue, to receive in discharge of all
demands of the United States, foreign silver
coins other tlinn Spanish milled dollars and
parts of such dollars, at the rates, and un
âdsr,tbe regulation by wbich they were re
ceivable before the 15<h day of October last;
that this regulation lhould continue fbrnvo
years, and until the end of the next fefiion
of Congress thereafter. And that so much
of the.said aft as relates to the circulation of
foreign gold coins, be suspended for the like
time."
Mr. Pinckney moved that the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury on the peti
tion of Robert Hazlehurft, and others, of
th* city of Charleston, on tht? fubjeft of
weighing goods imported, be referred to-the
Committee of Commerce and Manufactures.
This motion being agreed to, Mr. Pinck
ney .prefepjed the petition of fupdry wli rf
hoiders of that <c*ty on the fame fubjeft,
which was referred to the fame committee.
Mr. Gallatiu preferred the petition of
Mary Ivings, formerly of New-Jersey, but
now of this city, praying for compsnfation
for the services of her late hulband, and for
losses fuftaincd during the war. â  Referred
to the Committee of Claims.
A message was received from the Senate,
informing the House that they had appoint
ed ajoint committee of Enrolled Bills, and
requeuing the House would appoint ode on
its part.
Mr. Swanwick moved that the petition
of Edward Thompson, which he prcfented
some days ago, ajid a reference of which had
then been opposed by the Chairman of the
Committee of Claims, (hould be referred to
a Committee. Agreed.
Mr. Gallatin wished to know from the
Committee, why the diftinftion had been
made between Foreign Gold and Silver coin;
why they had not recommended the Aft to
be fl/fpended with refpeft to Silver as well
as Gold. He could not fee any reaf Â« .vhy
Crowns (hould not be a legal tender for pay
ments in General, as well as to the Collec
tors of the Revenue.
Mr. Sitgreav.'s rofc to propose another
queftiou to the Committee. His Colleague
had supposed the dillinftion which had been
madebct ween Foreign Gold and Silver Coin
was in favour of the Gold, and would limit
the circulation of the. Silver coin. He
(hould rather suppose the strength of th<>
diftinftion was the other way, and he wifhtd
to be informed what had induced the Com
mittee to recommend, a fufpenlion of the
laws refpefting Foreign Gold coin. They
knew the Silver coin circulated by tale, the
value of the latter had been aftually dimin
ished by various means, such 9s sweating,
plugging, clipping &c. so that there was no
methad of afeertaining, with precision, the
value of Gold coin, without weighing it ;
and persons not in mercantile habits, and
who were not possessed of a pair of foalet, |
were at a loss to know its value. The infe- '
rence he drew, therefore, was, that the '
sooner they could get the Gold coin out of j
circulation the better, and the quantity was
so small, that no great inconvenience would j
ensue from such a measure. With refpeft
to Giver coin, the provision recommended
would, he believed, occafionbut little incon- '
venience. But instead of suspending the '
aft as it related to gold coin, he thought 1
they ought to accelerate the period ofthrow-j
ing that coin altogether out of circulation, j
Mr. Venable (ths Chairman of the com- '
mittee) in answer to the two gentlemen [
from Pennsylvania, said, that the diftinftion :
which the committee had made betwixt Fo- i
reign Gold and Silver coin, was founded on j
this consideration, that the law relative to '
silver had already been carried into effeft,
ani the consequences which would be pro
duced by the provision recommended, were
now felt ; and it was supposed that this re
ftriftion would be a means of bringing the
Foreign Silver sooner into the MiMt ; as if
it were not allowed to be a legal tender for
auy thing but duties, its circulation would,
in a great degree be confined to the Sea*
ports, and when the United States got it
into poffefiion, they would fend it to the
Mint, aad it would be re-ilfued in our own
coin. With refpeft to gold coin, though
there was little of it in circulation near the
Banks, there was a great deal of it in re
mote parts of the country,where there were
no Banks ? so much, that it would be irn
poflible to bring it to the Mint, to have it
re-ifTued without sustaining great loss, and
without almost being totally deprived, in
the mean time, of a circulating medium.â
And tho' Foreign Gold coin was fubjeft to
the injuries which had been mentioned, our
own Gold coin was equally fubjeft to them.
Few of the coins of the United States, he
said, had found their way into the interior
of the country ; indeed, so rare, were they,
that when they were met with they were
preserved with as much care as if they were
curious medals.
Mr. J.- Williams approved of the report.
In the northern parts of the state of New-
York, and the northern and western parts
of Vermont, considerable merchandize was
carrried on with Canada, from whence they
received gold coin in payment ; and if the
law refpefting foreign gold was not suspend
ed, there would be no circulating medium
in that part of the country, as they had no
papers but all payments were made in dol
lars, crowns, guineas -ii'.d half joes. As to
a coin from the Mint of this Country it was
with'them quite a curiosity. *
Mr. Nicholas was not fatisfied with the
reason which his colleague (Mr. Venable)
bad given for not going farther in the buli
nefs. He seemed to think that the law for
prohibiting the circulation of foreign coin
had already been felt, as it refpefted silver.
He believed the firft (hock had only been
experienced. He did r.ot fee any advanta*?
to be derived from the regulation propoied.
It went to lesson the value of a certain kind
of property, in order to enforce it into the
mint of the United States; but until it could
be (hewn that such a mealure would be of
some advantage to the community, he did
not think that the house would be juftified
in adopting it. It would be said by the
people, and with propriety too, that they
had eftablifhrd a Mint, but could not work
it wjthout defrauding them of their proper
tyâ he had always thought eitablifh
tntnl ufiAcfs ; and in orderto make it other/
wife, a plan was now conltMptartW to rob';
the people of their property. If the ftme
regulations were to be adopted with reffeft
to gold, which were recotnmendedr relalive
to silver, the inhabitants of the interior fart
oi the Count! y would be wronged to ten
per cent of their rnonied capitals, as at ffe
fent a French crown would there pass for no
more than a dollar; he knew many whore
tained this kind of property in their hands,
because.they would not submit to the lass.
He saw no reason for prohibiting this kiid
ot coin; he believed it as good as any whbh
â¢could be given them iri exchange for it, as
a proof of this the banks of this City rec(i-
Ved it at its original value. The fame obftr
vations Would hold good with refptet to
good coin.- He thought it much better
that gold coin should pass according to its.
weigfit, than they should pass sanguinary
laws to punish persons for reducing its value.
He wiflicd therefore, that the whole law
might be suspended, as if the regulations
proposed were adopted, it would injure on;
party of the people, for no other reason thai)
beaaufe gentlemen were determined ta prc
fevere in what he deemed always an error, 1
the support of a national Mint.
Mr. Champ.in said, the arguments of the
gentleman lalt up did not go to the prelent
quettion, but to whether we fliould have a
Mint, or not. Mr. C. said, when he firft
saw the law for prohibiting the circulation
of foreign, he thought unfavorably of it ;
but, from the information he had received
on the fubjeft, he now thought differently
and believed, if the plan proposed by the
committee was agreed to,' it wyuld remove
any objeÂ£tions to its operation. He tho't
the reasons which had been assigned for the
regulations were good. With refpecl to
the effect it would have on the Mint, as
French crowns were to be received iinpay
ment by government* they would doubtless
be recoined ; banks wou'd also receive
French crowns, or parts thereof, their ope
rations would go on as usual, and the value
of this species of coin would not beleffeiied.
âThe aft incorporating the bank of the
United States had declare;!, that the notes
of that bank should be received in payment
by the officers of the United S f ates for du
ties, which had given a circulation to that pa
per more extensive than any other, which
would of course have a tendency to lefien
the evils complained of. He was well fat
isfied with this report : but, if any amend
ment could be made to it, which could make
it more acceptable to other gentlemtn, ancf
equally favorable to the Mint, he fheuld riot
object to it.
Mr. Nicholas asked whether it would be
in order to move to insert a resolution in
the report. Â«
The chaitman answering ia. the affirma
tive,
Mr. Nicholas said, to agree to the r*port
as it flood would be to set one part of the
people to speculate upon another ; as iA
those parts of the Union where little was
paid to the custom-house, a French crown
would pay for no more than a dollar, and it;
would be the bufinrfs of persons living in
sea-ports to purehafe thÂ»-m at a reduced va
lue, which woifld be giving a different valun
to coin in different parts of the country, and
be an unjust tax upon a large portion of the
people.
Mr. Harper agreed with the gentleman
just fat down, that if the coin of the Unit
ed States was no better than that whieh
they wished to flop the circulation of, everv
thing which had been done in the cftablifh
rnent of a mint was wrong. This point
had often been difcufTrd. It was agitated
when the mint was firft cftablifhed, and it
was decided that the coin to be issued from
the mint would be better than the coin then
in circulation ; not becau'fe a particular
piece of gold was of more value to an individ
ual, but because it was better for a nation to
have a coin of its own. It was on this ground
that the expence of the eftablifhraent was
juflified. Therefore the 'gentleman was
begging the quettion upon a fubjeÂ£t which
had long been decided. He was far from
being opinion of the gentleman from
Virginiljrthat the proposed regulation would
reduce the value of foreign coin ten per
cent ; for, if a French crown palled for an
hundred and teri cents in the sea ports, it
would soon have the fame value all over the
United States ; and if the rttempt to pur
chase them at an under-value were to be tri-*
ed, it would be found that a competion
would produce their real value. But, he
said, though there might not be much duty
paid in some parts of the country, there
were every where storekeepers who had deal
ings with the merchants in the sea ports,
and wbo would be glad to receive them in
payment for their goods. H: allowed some
little inconvenience might arifu, in thus en T
deavouring to promote the circulation of our
own coin ; but if the business was postpon
ed, the fame evil would always occur He
hoped, therefore, the regulation with ref
peft to silver coin, recoihmended by the
committee, would be agreed to. As tofu
reign gold coin, he should wifli that to be
put upon the fume footing, which would
bring it into the mint, and it would be turn
ed into circulation in a new shape. But
the committee had reported a face which,
if founded, was of importance, viz. " that
it was fcareely poflible (or the mint to recoiu
this money so fall as it should be brough;
in." If this were, so, ti:sy mufl either not
call it in, go on in enlarging the mint, or
have no mint at all. But he did not take
the fait as Hated. He believed there was
no waot of meohanical force in '.he mint.
Mi. Vcnable interrupted Mr. Harper to
fay, the committee did not mean that the
mint had not the necessary mechanical force;
but that they could not get fuSicient bul
lion for the occasion.

from V.rginia ( Mr. Nicholas's) motion was in

The Chairman faidh.e had mentioned his in
tention of moving a resolution, but had pot
handed it to tliÂ« chair.
Mr. Nicholas said, that underftandirig his
motion was in order, he should make it. He
â would firft state one fafl, wnith would be fuffi
cient to answer all the reafor.ing of the gentle-
men from South-Carolina and RhoHe-Ifland
( Mr. Harper and Mr. Champlin)âThough in
the large cities hank notes were equal to every
purpose as a circular medium, ia the country
where he lived they paflcd at a depreciation on
( ly This resolution wa>t<> the following effe>fl:
" RefolÂ« ed, that so much of the a<ft, relative
to fi|v e r coin, &c. as goes to restrain the cirru
llition of foreign coin, be fafptnded for a hrait
- edtirne."
' Mr. Gall; tin was in favour of this resolution.
He did not think the propofiticn of the commit
tee went far enough. It did not follow, as the
gsntleman from S. Carclina had dated, that be
cause a French Crown should be payable only
for certain purpofts, that moment it became aw
article of merchandize, which would rife and
fall according to the demand there might be for
it. This was the cafe with a'l foreign coins in
every country where they did not pass as a legal
tender. If there were any weight in the argu
ment of the gentleman, from 8. Carolina, *th it
hecaufe the collcAorg would receive crowns at
110 centÂ», they would alyays be worth it, it '
might be carried farther and said, that becaufc 1
, this coin has this value in any other country, it ]
cannot depreciate here. It appeared, therefore, '
that though the provision lecommended would ]
*âºÂ».. xemedy the evil, iti Fome degree, it would not *
remedy it altogether, and that where there was
not a demand tor this species of coin, it would t
depreciate in its value Mr. G. said it was clear. t
we had not more circulating m.-dium in tlic.
aoutitry than was neceflary for the purppfes of r
commerce, and that, therefore, the withdraw
ing any part of it would 6e au evil. It waÂ»
neeeflary, therefore, to enq'iire whether any
good would arise fi-om such a measure, to criim
tc'rbdanee the ev:l. The gentlemen from K.
, Ifiand and S. Carolina said, it was neeeflary to si
the existence of the mint What were the ad- f|
â â vantage* to be derived from the mint ? They f s
were told, that the g>eat objeift was to have a a
coin ot our own This oblervation could not '
apply to foreign silver coin, because the law de- -
clared that Spani/h dollars should circulate as
usual, which acknowledged that we fUod in
need of foreign coin for a circulating medium,
and that our mint was inefficient for the pur
; pose. But, in relation to the mint itfelf. It
was said, the proposed measure would force the
foreign coins into the mint. He wished to know c
how this could be effeaed? How could direfling vi
the coHediors to receive this coin force it into is
the mint ? Was it fuppofsd that the momentthe tl
banks or the revenue officers receive crowns,
they will carry them to the mint ? How had it
hoppened that, in receiving seven millions of , c
revenue from the custom-houses, that more of in
this coin had not heretofore Been sent to the at
mint ? And could it now be fpppofed that they w
would be compelled to take rhis coin to.the b<
mint ? In relat'on to gold coin, the gentleman j n
from South-Carolina had said, that the only
way of getting it into the mint, was to fay it
should not be a legal tender. But why thus
force the people to take this species of coin to
the mint j It was-clear it could not be the inter- ca
eft of government to have a mint, if it were
not the interest of the people j ind if they saw
, it to be their interest, they would take their so- j; c
reign coin there, without bring forced ro do it.
But, said he, if you suppress all foreign coins, r
you will do it contrary to the will and interell Wl
ofthe people ; (Scif'thiswcre the only meirsby
which government could ellabliih their miut, th
bethought the infhtutlon would never become a bli
very popular one. ' ca
Mr. Harper interrupted Mr. G. to fay he did
not fay that this was the only way in which the 1
mint could be supported. He said it was ene W
efie<s)ual method. cx
Mr. Gallatin continued his obXervatiors. frc
When the mint was firft eflvblifhed, it was said, it
that in three years from its commencement, there am
would be such a quantity of our own coin in s ol
circulation, ae would fupercede th; cereffity of
foreign gold, or silver coin. Expedience had r
shewn, however, that the friends of the eftab-.
lifhment were mistaken. There was not now a
fuflii-ient quantity ; but they were told, not
withstanding, that all foreign coin, except
Spanifk dollars and parts thereof, should be call- nu ,
ed in. He hoped not. If, when they came to f 0 t
consider the mint eftablifiiment, it should ap- >
pear to be neceflYry to take such a step, he '
Crusted they should take such naeafuresas would '
beeffei?lual, without putting any class of peo- P O7
pie to loss. Until the mint were eliabfifhed up- tidt
on a footingwhich &ouid render it equal 10 the met
supply of a fufficiency of coin for the wfe of fa
the country, he hored they should leave the a j
foreign coins upon their present footing.
On 'motion, the committee rose, reported /
progress, and had leave to fit again. " ea

to honour the memory of its founders, who
es, have fallen vi&ims to their glorious zeal in
the cause of Liberty. They are no more ;
we enjoy the fruits of their labours. Every
ie- nation has revered and celebrated their Le
30 giflators and their deliverers ; public, grati
de tude consecrated monumentsto their fame
ee Harmodius and Ariftogiton had statues' in â 
o- Athens; Lyciirgus in Sparta. Rome in
to ftituted games, and raised temples to Romu
it Iws and Remus. The name of William Tell
n . is still regarded with affeftion by the inhab
it Hants of happy Switzerland ; his name is
, e engraved upon the rocks from whifh he pre
:k cipitated the Austrian ttranny j it is ecle-.
brated with enthusiasm upon the theatre
Â»n of " Europe, it is recorded in all the poets
,lf who have sung of Liberty and of great men.
a The name of Penn, the firft Legislator "of
â¢d the new world, remains dear to philosophy
rt and to humanity. Barnevelt and Sidney '
are remembered with increasing glory, and
their memory will live to the latest age. A '
cfcntury of refpeft and of tears has already '
avenged these generous Citizens, who died '
r . for their Country's Liberty. The names of '
â n, the Tirtuoud men who have founded the
ie French Republic, and who have periled in '
n its cause, (hall they be condemned to an in- '
, e gloricns descent to future times? What do
g I fay? An inglorious descent? I have '
_ seen them, while alive, perfected by envy '
r and calumny, direaed by malice ; they were '
â¢- worthy of the immortality of virtue ; their
s cotemporaries, by their ingratitude, 'and the
, friends of Kings, by their hatred of them, J
_ have acquired the immortality of crime.
Here the fcaffolds have been stained by the
blood of the brave Lcgiflators who levelled i
the firft strokes at the Throne, and proclaim- 1
ed the Republic. There, the murderous '
f steel, when courage nerv'd the arm, saved 1
. others from the hands of the assassins. Here a
. in savage dens .and frightful solitudes, they
hid themselves from the fury of their impla- "â 
â  cable enemies. There, others fell before u
; the swords of Despots. Soon after, those d
. who had given liberty to the world could C
: not find an afyluni in their own country. A
cabal that was conspiring in favour of Kings 9
were nearly on the point of burying the re- -
mainder of its firft founders under the ruins
of the Republic ; and black calumny was
ready at hand, had they failed of success, to *
transmit their names, branded and stigma
. tized to a deluded posterity. R*prefenta- ~

, cumulated ou trages, and to change the tables I

your benefactors. And jndeed what do we
fee but cold statues, inanimate monuments,
vain allegories, that encumber your palaces,
your public squares, your public hal's : C<
while the hallowed images of the Condorcets Su
the Vergniauds, and of the firft founders of
the Republic, objefts so dear to every true
Republican, are as yet no where seen to So
speak to the eyes and to the hearts ot the Qi
people. No monument has yet been raised
in honour to those who, like them have de
voted themselves to the facrcd cause of Li- m '
berty. Buried in an unjust and ungrateful fcr
oblivion, they still await the tardy homao-e to
of their cotemporaries. Free Nations, of f'
whatever defctiption, teverence your dehV â 
erers, unless you prefer falling under the iTc
rod of tyrants. It is at the present moment w '
especially, you ftiould signalize your grati
tude towards them ; when the Liberty of M
Nations is at issue with the power of Kings, '
it is a gratitude which both justice and poll- Co
cy equally combine to inspire. I move that
there be ere&ed a monument with the sol- ~
lowing infeription :â" To the Plunders of
the prench Republic, who during the courfc of
the Revolution, have fallen vtdims of their
felf-devotioij to their Country"
The principle was adopted by the Coun- 1
cil, and the means of executing it were re-
ferred to a Committee.
On motiou of Males, organ of a Special
Cpmmifiion, it was decreed, that the excep- a " c
tion made in favour ofthe Dutch and Danirh
Companies by the 13th article of the law of brii
the 10th Brumaire, which prohibits the im
portation and sale ofEngli(h merchandizes, l'! c
(hall be extendedto the Swedish India Com- c ' r( ,'
pany, established at Gottenburg. or j
Poulain Grandpre.â" You have confe- re
crated the republican institution, by decree
ing tkat you would repose from your la- bo"u
bours on the decadis, and on the republican nor
fetes. But of what avail is example on the " el
mind olegotijlsâon those fouls that are so ~S
deeply imbued with the prejudices of the
old regime, who flatter themselves with the
hopes of the restoration of monarchy, and Â£) c ' (
who lock 011 rile 18th Friictidbr as a public I
calamity ? I', is by laws they ought to be ~
repressed. I move, therefore, that a com- ' i
mittee be appointed to examine the ques
tion, whether it may be proper te forbid the -jr
journals to put any other date at the heads 1
of their journals than that of the republi- )'<*
can sera, under pain of being fappreffed, and
