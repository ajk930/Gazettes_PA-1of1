Tint the disease which proved so mortal
in riiiladelpliia in the finnrr.er' and autumn ,
of 1703, was the fame as that ctferihed byj
Dr. Chifnolip, he remarks, "is established b\)
the following Gift : " A vefftl belfvngitig tÂ«
Philadelphia introdnce'd the difcafe into St
Pierre, Martinique, in Oftober 1793. Aid
ther veful, isotn I\v.v-Xjondon, touched at*
Pierre, in her way to Grenada, and re-i
reived the infection : On her arrival at'
Grenada, in February 1794, the fck were
put under my charge; and I found the lif
cafe to be my old acquaintance the md'r'-
uant pestilential f.-ver."â (Page ;di.) Â°
I iiat the two Qifeafes were the fame in
h : ''d, is also demonftratgd from the defcrip
-1 t;on the symptoms, and from the cafci an
wtxed to Dr. Chifliolm's puhheatioti:
" 11 " yellow fufTufion of the eyes ana
' v.n in Ui:j c'ifcafs, wl;c;i it prevailed at
Grenatfii, which was by no means a general
Bccurrciu't 1 , appeared about the Cth, 7th,
or 9th day.''âPage 129.)
This circtirnftance, and the d.Tease being
contag-ous, Dr. Chifliolm thinks are proofs
that this disease was not the fame as the yel
low fever which generally attacks ftrar.gers
on their arrival in the Weft-Jndies. But
from the black vomitting which occured in
molt of the cases which proved fatal, and
its resemblance to the yellow fever of
'the i(lands in all its moil efien'tial and leading,
symptoms, I judge those (irciunftances alone
will uot juftify his conclusion.
The less frequent occurrence of the yellow
Uiffufion at Grenada, in 1795, was, proba
bly, owing to a less than ordirfory difpofl
t'.on 01 the inhabitants to bilious complaints
that fe'afoh, than sometimes happens in o
tners. For it is a common observation that
when inflammatory complaints occur in Au
tumn, they arc niore disposed to have re
mifiions, .and are frequently accompanied
with bilious evacuations, efpeciajly in level
filiations with moist foil, thau at any other
fcafon or in any other situation.
I have also frequently observed in Phila- '
delphia, that when the small-pox becomes 1
prevalent in the autumnal feaYon, when the :
weather is calm and sultry, that bilious
symptoms art coijimon, and the patient some
times becomes afTcÂ£ted with yellowness ie
fembling the jaundice.
Neither yellowness of the forface, nor
black vomiting are efTential, but Accidental
circumstances in the malignant fever arising
from human contagion, as is evident from
numbers recovering from the disease,
othersdying of it, without exhibiting ei
ther of these symptoms.
The account publi/hed by Df. Brice of
the origin and progress of the TellowFever,
which prevailed on board the Bufbridge East
Indiaman, while failing within or near the
Tropics, in 1792, an analysis of which is
given in Duncan's annals of medicine, for
1796, also democftrates that It is the ofF
fpring of human effluvia, rendered pestilen
tial by being retained in somites in confined
and heated air. >
Thomas Storey, in his * urnal, and Jo
seph Gough in his History of the Quakers,
relates that a malignant fever prevailed in
Philadelphia in 1699, introduced from the
Weft-India islands.
Dr. Mitchell who sent a dcfcriptios of
the Yellow Fever, as it appeared in Virginia
in 174 1 a "d '47, ascribes it to fpecific con*-
tagion and mentions that it has been twice
brought into Virginia by hisMajefty's fhipis
of war !
Among other fymptorr|s he mentions " a
yellowness of the eyes, and all over the bo
dy at the height of the diteafe, unless pre
vented by colliquation or critical difchat--
gÂ«-" t
Dr. Ijeamy, in the physical cflays of E
dinburgh, informs us -that the Yellow Fever
which has prevailed at different periods at
Charleston, South Carolina, was always tra
ced to some infected person recently arrived
from the Weft-Indies. ,
In 1741 it was introduced by a chest of
wearing apparel which had belonged to a
person who died of it at Barbadoesâ(Lind's ,
effayon fevers and infection.) It also ap
peared in Philadelphia in 1747 âIn 1762
it was introduced by a mariner from the Ha
tar.ua, according to the notes of Dr. Red
ir.an.
This disease, after an interval of 33 years 1
again made its appearance in Philadelphia. 1
the latter end of July, or beginning of Au- j
gust in the year 1793 ; and from the follow- 1
ing circumstances appears to have been in- 1
troduced by infeftion imported from the
Weft-Indies, though Dr. Rush in oppofir |
tion to all former experience and obfervati- (
on ascribed its origin to the effluvia of da- 1
maged Coffee, upon a wharf to the <
open air in the neighbourhood where the di- f
feafe firft made its appearance. i
" The sloop Amelia, Wm. Williams, t
(fays Mr. \ anuxem, owner of the vessel, in 1
hjs letter to Mr. Carey, published in the
Federal Gazette) from Borgne, (a small t
portofSt. Domingo) to Philadelphia sprang I
a leak : the whole of her cargo being Cos- d
fee in bags, the linen soon rotted with the t
fait water, and the bags bursting ; the cos- p
fee difperftd itfelf into the hold of the vef- r
fel, which rendered it impofiible to remove I
tjie ~ water, which remainiiyj there such v
length of time, could not be otherwise than b
offenfive. The Amelia arrived here the si
23d of July, was unloaded on the 24th. fl
Several hundred weight of the most darna- ci
ged coflee were thrown into the dqck ; and ei
on the 30th, 98 bags were fold on the m
whavt by Richard Footman, Audtioneer. tr
On the lit August tiic vessel left the wharf al

MR. FEN NO,
I observe with concern that a daily print,
' which, bur a few months pad, came oiit
1 with profefliotis of animadverting upon those,
' whose mifconduft should lay them open to
the lath of cenfurc ; has, lately become a
? mere fink of personal abuse and scurrilous
s remarks. I fee that even charily has not
escaped the unmerited attack of this, now
s vindictive paper ; for not later than last even
-1 ing, is a fhameful abuse of a poor man, by
'j name Wm. Bell, who is reported to have
r given 50 cents to the " widow and.father
lefs" from the small pittance which his daily
â  labour acquired. It is not for man thus
e hnrfhly to adjudge his neighbours deeds !
We have too great need of mercy ourselves,
v to drive to withhold it from our fuffcring
fellow-creatures ! An unbiassed and ijppar
tial Judge, will on a future day give to each
s his due ; and doubtless in the distribution of
rewards, the bright example of \.h\ipoor but
4 worthy man, will not be forgotten ; for
our Saviour's tcilimony in favor of the wi
" dow and her mite, is enough to (hew, jhat
this was a most pleasing and acceptable pre
sent to the Almighty. If the author of
r the remarks alluded to, poffefs'd the smallest
. portion of chnjlian charity, he would blush
at the imputations he has cast upon it. "
s I I believe that the purest examples of cha
e ; rity will more generally be found among the
3 poorer class of people ; who feel themfe/vet
- the misery they relieve in othersâand hence
" necessarily make a facrifice in so doing ;
whilst the opulent and rich who give only
r from their abundance, cannot be entitled
to an equal share of praise. However, from
r whatever motive charity arises, and in what-
J everfhape it may appear, it should be held
Vj alike sacred from contempt and obloqwy.
" J I shall conclude by recommending to the
writer of the remarks alluded to, in the
' words of that holy religion whicbjjfic pro
> | feffes to refpeftâ" go, and do toou like
t wife"âfor " charity covereth a multitude

M*. FENNO,
' In Brown's Gazette of Saturday, I fee
a publication by a Dr. Sayre, setting forth
- his great success in the cure of the yellow
> fever. If this gentleman means to establish
1 his own fame he proves enough ; but if he
means to hold a wing over that of our friend
Sangrado, he proves too much. He advo
f rates blood-letting in the frjl days of the
' disease : Sangrado begins and eÂ»ds with it.
" He applies mercury in order to produce
: salivation : Sangrado in order to purge.
' Now, if Dr. Sayre is as candid as he ap
pears to be, let him examine fafts, and let
1 him try the use of mercury without blood
â  letting, and he will confefs that the latter
â¢ does injury and only retards the operation
â  of the other. I shall conclude these remarks
on Dr. Sayre's letter with observing, that
I was surprised to fii\d Diemerbroeck quot
' ed as an authority for copious bleeding. I
â  Ihe following is an pxtraft from that au
â  thor: " lUud en'wi obfervavimus, ft peftt
correptis vena feearetur, il/oj ad unum omnes
certo ei cito obeijfe."âLib. iii. p. 154.-J-
Which, I take it, means in plain
that " those who were bled in the plague
died to a man, and that quickly."

It has often ftruckmewith astonishment,
that among the number of fubjedts intro
duced in our public prints, so little regard
is paid to the most important, and efTential
to our interests, as a republican people ; I
mean the equalization of mankind. * 1 "
But, whilst even our best patriots are
taking a philanthropic view of the numerous
countries which surround us, and gazing
with anxious concern on the disastrous
events which have and still continue to de
solate those quarters of the globe, is it not
matter of amazement to observe their inat
tention to a fubjeft which more immediately
concerns them ?
When we view with horror and indigna
tion the oppreflive system introduced by the
Norman conquest (the feudal system) and
discover the numerous ills which resulted
therefrom, what can it be but that base !
principle felf-;ntereft, which prevents our 1
regarding the situation of our country ? J
How far preferable was the situation of a j
villein, who could claim and who could not I
be deprived of the right to Â« part of the 1
fruits of his labour, to the poor American 1
slave, who, after having laboured almost in-
ceffantly, from morning till night, yea, i
';ven fomeVimes longer, is compelled to sub- a
mit the fcllowance of his meals to the arbi- i
trary will of an unfeeling master ! Yet,
although \ve r hcld the farmer condition' 1 in l
' abhorrence, we ri'ffialu in a perfect flats of
' apathy with refpeM to the latter. Whillt
- lam now writing, mv imagination paints
8 the GtuatMQ-bf a pregnant woman, Itfbour
-1 '"g in the field, and expo fed to the fcorch
i nig rays of the summer's fnn, her tyranrii
) cal overseer ftandiag.by her and wavino; his
mighty cowhide, tht inJignia of his office ;
I fee the poor foul fcized with tHe qualms
niciu'e.) t to one in her situation ; yet what'
can fnc do ; either continue to labour mi/fl
the acutenefs of the paw precipitates her
to the ground, or fubmi\ to the cruel ftrfpes
â ' Â°f the urirelentihg tyrant, on the difcovVuy
- of the fmallell iiitfcrmiffion t>f her exertions,
i And this is not merely the phantom of ittia
r filiation, but a description of a situation,
r which alas, top often K&ually occih\.
s But, 'unhappy refre&ion ! some of our
s befi republicans' (ff we may believe their
t prqfcflions) rft-ij our greatest tyrants ! Is it
no? aftomfhircg to fee men who are daily
- preaching up liberty and equality, and pro
e fefring to be friends to the levelling of dif
â¢ ttnftions, yea, inveighing with great acri
mony against the oppreflion and tyranny of
Icings, repair to their farms, and there, for
the smallest offence, exeicife the most wan
ton and flagitious atts of cruelty upon those
in fubjedlion to them ? And yet this state
ment is verified by tho conitlft <6f many,
, within the circle of my small acquaintance,
t What exetife then can be offered in juftifi
, cation of this inhuman and cowhrdly con
> dust ? None I imagine, unlef. ft be that
a hackneyed obfervatioti, that they are a de
s generate race of mapkind, and totally irica
t pable of improvement. But mart of wif
r doin, be cautious how you use this argu
ment, fince so many instances can be ad
-1 I duced to disprove it.
Let us then Contrast the fituatfon of a
- state, to w
lyfh slavery is a ftrarigcr, to one
r wherein it exists. In Pennfyivar.ia the in
-5 duftrious farmei l , featcd in a comfortable
- cabin, bcholdn with pleasure his beloved
, spouse cooking the produft of their mutual
C labour, after regaling themselves with,
they retiit"to bed 1 ! hnving offered up to God
i their devout thanks for the blessings they
f had received. Here no terrors of imagina
t tion prey upon their minds, and disturb their
r reft; what they have was attained by their
- own industry, and no one feels disposed to
t deprive them thereof. But in a state where
- slavery exifls, mark the difference. The
f discontented slave, conscious of his inability
t to p'eafe, feels no other stimulus to labour,
> but to fleer clear of the bitter lash, and in
that but seldom fuoceeds; whilst the unfeel
ing master, lolling in the midst of luxury,
J Jcnows no other emotions than those of an
' ger and chagrine at the incompetency of
their labour, ( tÂ« support his unbounded de
; fires; and evsn the hours of reft are disturb
ed by a knowledge of his anger; for the
I age of reason is at'hand, and mankind can
1 be kept no longer in ignorance. Let us
then endeavour to evert the blow, by timely
I attention, and let us no longer, profefiing
ourselves republicans, keep those in fubjee

to that most inestimable of all bleflings, li

A great criGs in European affairs is drawing; nigh.
The materials fetm to be every where fermenting
for a louder cxptnfion, and a wider ruin, than b:-
fore. Yet one wr uM think enough had herti al
ready done in the way of confufion and deftru&ion
to tire those who do not love buftl': and to fatisly
those who do. This war has, beyond example,
defolatcd thÂ« ear'h, and reddened a great deal of
its once green furfacvâ it is to be rc-peopled and
made fruitful agaiu by a multitude, whom
have iHnde familiar with blood, and unfamiliar
with evil order and the mild social virtues. F.u
ppe, when nt peace, will be thronged with rob
!'CT9 and alTaffins. beeg-ars and cripples \merica,
happy in the enjoyoient of peace ami liberty, will
sympathize with the unhappy of Europe, and wilh
them all the relief that will make the-i contented
to (lay at home. For no refle&ing friend of this
country will desire to fee the natural growth of its
found and healthful population swelled into a mon
ilrous increase by the rulhingin amr-ngus of the
discontented and licentious dregs of foreign na
tions. Our growth is already quick enough, our
lands will be worfc fettled, if they (hould be fet
tled fafter. Yet many speak with joy of theprof
pe<2 that troubles abroad will pour in millions in
mass upon usâas if the United States ought t<) be
proud of bean- a kind ps bettering house, or Bed
lam, or rather a Botany Bay for Europe. The
wife and worthy 4r.d the valuable laborers will he
welcome when they eothe, and they will not come
so croud us; it is a-*?ry different clajs that is to be
drÂ«aded. ,
In this apprehension of a fwoln and unfotmd emi
gration from the diflurbed nations, as well as on
many political accounts, we have a deep concern in
foreign affairs. After several years of blood
, filed and confufion, the prof;>c<Jt of peace and tran
quility is yet far removed. New troubles fecm to
lie commencing. Pruflia and Auftfia threaten hof
tilit'es. Portugal is in danger cf being conquered.
Italy is revolntionmng and Buonaparte willfcarce
ly leave one finneÂ«/ the old edifice of !h' irgov
ernm nts 011 another. France is agitated within,
and the Dire&ory is courting the armies to fide
with them against the Council of Five Hundred.â
Happy is o;<r let, that we may fit under our own
vine and figtree.

Mochlni for cleaning Cotton.
Mr. Dole, a French citizen from St. Do
mingo, for some time pad a resident of this
city, has invented and conftrudled a machine
tor cleaning cotton, which, from the experi
ments already maifc, bids fair to excel any .
machiue for the fame purpose hitherto in
vented. It is composed of two diftindt gins,
which are so connected 23 to be set in mo- 1
tion by a cogg-wjieelj which is to be turned â 
by a horse. Prom the experiments already
made,/ when it was turned by hand, its per
formance exceeded tbe most fangnine ex-
it delivered of clean cot- 1
ton in ene mjnute, samples of which have I
been shewn to judges of this valuable article, .1
who declare that the staple of the cotton
was not in the least injured. The machinery
appears furprizingly neat, and there is not
a doubt but it will fully answer the purposes
intended. It if shortly to be fixed in a 1
place where a horse will-turn it, when it will J
be open for the infpeftion of the citizens.

The coafimiffioners for alleviating the dif

To the Inhabitants of said city and itsivici
nity.
Perihit us to address you at this awful
lay before you a brief ftatetnent
of the d: .'rdTLng situation of our fuffering
V feltof-citi/ens. It is known to you that
on tb ; e firft day qf September we accepted
of tie. appointment from the governor, to
aft as commifiioners for the piu-pofe of re
lieving the indigent, by donation and em
ployment, with the stipulated sum of ten
thouland dollars, granted by the legislature ;
and we presume it was generally believed at
that time to be more than fufficient, arising
from an expeftatmn that the disease would
soon abate, and that our absent friends
- would return and give employment to those
j whose refourees were cut off by their leav
â¢ , ing the city ; ftut, alap ! how are we dif
appomted in our expectation, for our sity
yet continues in the fame desolated gloomy
Hate, and consequently all means of employ
ment for the industrious mechanic and la
bourer are still suspendedâAdd to this the
numerous body of females that procured a
livelihood by,iva/hing, ironing, needle work,
scc. who are left deflitute of their usual
means of subsistence, besides a number who
are aged arid infirm, that used to obtain re
lief from the bounty of their more able
- | friends znd relations, as well as many fea
e | men's wives who depend on the merchant
j for part of their husband's monthly pay r and
I who are now deprived of reliff frwm that
source. In this deplorabje situation we
found not less than three thousand people,
including children, when we undertook to
execute the trust reposed in us, the number
of these have since greatly increased, and
they still remain in the fame fuffering con
dition, with this difference, then they had
the consoling reflection, that the commission
ers had ten thoufind dollars ready to meet
their exigencies, but now it is expended ;
and lamentable for us to be obliged to in
form themâ" We know not where to fend
you, or what to advise you to do- Our
money is gout* We lmv. .to acquaint
you we cannot promise your small pittance
one week louger we feel for youâwe
fuffer with youâwe know your distress
what can we do ? we can only promise you
we will make your situation known to our
fel'ow-citizens, and you mull rely on their
benevolence.
Friends and fellow-citizens,
If you mean to give relief through us, we
have only to observe that our endeavours
fiiall be to continue to distribute it accord
ing to your benevolent intentions and their
neceflities. If, on the otjier hand, it (hould,
be your pleasure to entrust youf monies for
the above purpose, in the hands of any o
ther set of men, we (hall hold ourselves
bound to give all and every information or
afiiftanee that experience has furnifhed us
with, so as to facil'tate your laudable pur
poses ; and in either cafe we think it pro
per to annex our names and places of abode.

In a few days I mean to reply"Tnpre fully
to your three last letters to me ; jn the mean
time I indulge a hope, th?t you will furnifli
Sie with less evaflve anfwevs- than those you
.'have given to several of the queftiinis I hid
"proposed to you : one fcf 'these queftiops I
fna'.l row repeat, though in a different form ;
firft dating wh it you do not deny, that the
crew of the Arethufa -were healthy when
they were discharged, and that they remain
ed so at tutir refpeftive lodgings, where
thtfy had deposited what you call their in
fected materials without-giving the prevail
ing fever even to one person there, and yet
you fay " that Mr. Latimer, Mr. Lewis
and others might have received the conta
gion from passing near those people with
their infefted materials." I now aik you,
whether from any of those records ancient
or modern which you hs.ve quoted on the
present occasion, you can furnifli an instance
of the crew'of a (hip in perfedt health, ever
Â» having given the yellow fever to a number
of people whom they had transiently psfled
in the streets or elfewherc, and at the fame
time not having infe&ed any of those with
â¢whom they lodged or where their supposed
infe&ed materials were deposited ? \ ou fay
that you were induced to address me again
by a powerful desire of ascertaining the ori
gin or true cause of the prevailing fever, if
your labours terminrJe here in the present
instance, they will be of little life to the pub
lic ; or do you mean to crown those labours
by proposing such means or.regulations in
addition to those already adopteS, as may
probably prevent a repetition of our present
calamity from the various causes which you
have assigned ? if you have not this in view,
you will aft the part of a phylieian who
should tell his patient that he was stimulat
ed by a powerful desire of ascertaining
. the origin and cause of his disease, and then
to leave him either to fink under it, or to
apply to some other physician for the falu
]tary means of recovery. For my own part
I now declare that I should not have ap
peared before the public on the present oc
casion, unless with a view, firft of tracing
our present calamity to what I conceived to
be its tru? source, and thenxif pointing out
the probable means of preventing a repeti
tion of it from fitr.ilar causes hereafter. In
my next address to you or to t'a? public, I
fllall propose such means or regulations as
appear to me most likely to succeed, fubjeft
however to any 'salutary iniprovewents
which a candid discussion thereof ma.y intro- j
diice. I shall then ihew the difficulties I
that are opposed to the adoption and exe-1
cution of such regulations as can afford any !
â¢security against the future attacks of the
yellow fever of tropical origin, if it can be
introduced in all the variety of ways that
you have mentioned in your seVeral letters
to roe. I hope I shall soon receive answers
to the several questions which T have asked
you, your firft address to me having furnifh
ed me with a fair claim to them ; and as I
am npw told that yon reside in the country,
it is probable yon there poflefs that leisure
and retirement, which you heretofore al
ledged you had not at your command ; yet
if these should still be too heavily taxed by
your correspondence with me, you must
place it solely to the account of that leisure
and retirement which it seems you had at
your command, when you commenced your
unprovoked and illiberal attack on my letter
to Dr. Mease.

For tht Gazette of tlx United Stater.
AS physicians of diftinguifht;d abilities
and experience in this country as well as it
the Weft-Indies differ extremely in opinion,
refpe&ing the most cffc&ual means of treat
ing the malignant yellow fever, and particu
larly refpefting the use of hlood-letting, and
as nothing cÂ»:i determine a question of faft
but 3 statement of cases and a comparison of
the success which has attended each method
of treatment : I am induced to ft?te the re
; fult of my experience on the fnbjeft in hopes
of inducing others to do the fame that a
question of so much public concern, may be
cleared from the ambiguity in which differ
ent views and idle fpeftators liaveinvolved it.
oa. 9. Wm. currie.
That copious and a frequent repetition
of blood-letting was frequently salutary in
the malignant yellow fever which prevailed
in Philadelphia in the autumnal season oT '93,
I am convinced from numerous cases in
which I employed it, and which from rea
soning on the nature of the disease and from
its speedy tendencies to putrefaftion, as well
as from the writings of several Weft-India
physicians, I strenuously opposed till incon
trovertible faÂ£ls in the praftice of" others
convinced me that it was fafe' in aH cases
distinguished by inflammatory symptoms.
But my subsequent experience in 1793> a,, d
in '94 well as the present season-has taught
me that blood-letting accelerates
the fatal termination of the disease by in
creasing debility and inducing typhous co
ma, in all cases and in every fiage of the di
sease, when the prostration of strength is ve
Â»y diftinft, accompanied with great oppres
sion and anxiety at the precordia,fhrunk and
pale countenance, deep sighing and restless
ness, (which with the suddenness of the at
tack, short continuance of the chill, pain in
the head, redness of the eyes or soreness and
burning sensation in the stomach, taken ccl
ledtively, distinguish it from every variety
of the bilious or remitting fever) together
with the weakness, quickness, small and
foft adlion of the arteries at the wrists.
In September 1794, the malignant yel
low fever wa3 introduced into Philadelphia
by travellers from Baltimore, where it had
prevailed for some time previous to its ap
pearance here, it was also introduced from
St. Marks by the snow Commerce, com
manded by Mr. Shirtliff. Archibald Flow
er who caught the disease by sleeping on
board the snow, was bled once on the se
cond and twice on tjie- third day from the
attackâthe last blood after becoming cold,
didjiat fepjirate into ferurn and craflamen
tnm.but remained perfectly fluid, and rc
fe-nbled in colour and confidence a mixture
of rrtolaljes and water. Of 27 patients that
I attended with the yellow fever in 1794,
only nin: recovered. The greatest number
of those to whdm the disease proved mortal
were bled three times within the firft three'
dtfys from the attack, and two of them five
times, the lift quantity taken from any one
in the course of the disease was 45 ounces,
and the Lirgeft quantity 82 ounces. And
Dr. Buchannan afEures me in a letter, an
extraft from which was publi'fhed in Mr.
| Fenno's Gazette some tinfie in Oftober, of
fame year, that those who bled most at Bal
timore that season, loft the greatest number
of patients.
Previous to my leaving the city on ac
count of the fickrufs and situation of my
own family, the present feafpn, I attended
seventy patients, fifty-four of whom reco
vered. Of these 70 patients, 34 were bled
three times at the early period of the fever,
vid freely purged with a compofition.con
flftingof calomel 5 grs. jalap 10 grs. arid
I cream of tartar 1 fcru. given every four
hours till it had the intended effedl. Of i
j these 24, 21 recovered. Of 13 that were 1
j bled only once and freely purged, 11 reco- |
1 vered, 2 died. 14 were bled three times â 
and treated in other refpe&s like those that
were bled twice, 11 recovered. 3 died 5
were bled four times, &c. 3 recovered, 2
died. 6 were bled five time?, 3 recovered,
3 died. 1 was bled nine times and I eleven
times, and both recovered. In both the
: last mentioned patients, symptoms of in
flammation were very evident and remarka
bly obstinate, poflibly supported by the
daily use of mercury in small dofex> the
. most phlogistic of all medicines when em
: ployed in that manner. An inflamed state
; of the ftomnch in the patient that was bled
j eleven times was the predominant complaint,
I and the blood in the latter stage of the dif
; ease always threw up a tough bufly fire,
and imdsnieatli it retained a healthy aspect,
as did that also of the patient that was bled
nine times. The patient that was bled ele
ven times in the course of seven days, loft
100' on ices; the other about 96 ounces,
j Six patients wer.' not bled at all, owing to
insuperable prejudices, 3 recovered, 3 died.
From the preceding cases, as well as
from a multiplicity of others that have
come under my observation, 1 am confident
that blood-letting, to a certain extent, as
j well as purging, is not only fa r e but abfo-
I lutely beneficial, in all cases and at every pe
-1 riod of the malignant yellow fever, in which
I inflammatory fymjitoms or even an inflam
matory diathesis is preient, and especially
when the head is aflfe&ed with acute pain,
or the stomach with a painful and burning
sensation, and the pulse quick and tense or
chorded, whether the limbs be preternatu
rally hot or moist ; whereas in every cafe
that I have seen it employed, attended with
great prostration of strength, oppreflive
weight and sense of stricture about the
thorax, with a low, small, quick and irre
gular pulse, it has invariably accelerated
the fatal termination of the disease.
That repeated blood-letting has often
been employed with advantage in the plague,
which is a higher grade of the yellow fever,
as the yellow fever is of the typhus or con
tagious fever generated in clofc, confined
and impure iituations, we have instances in I
the works of the accurate Sydenham, in the
Journal of the Plague at Marseilles, as re
corded by the learned and refpedlable Mead,
in his Discourse on the Plague, page 220, j
Dublin edition of 1767, and in the account ;
of it at Aleppo, by Dr. P. RufTel, publilh
ed in 1790.
The abuse, the excess, or the mif-tinied
application of bleeding, therefore, and not
its* judicious and well-timed application,
should be condemned and rejeÂ£ted in the
yellow fever. But to condemn and rejeft it
in all cases indiscriminately, argues not only
want of experience, but of reading, refleftion
and common sense.
Dr. Chifliolm a.furcs us that he cured the
generality of the patients that came under
his care at Grenada, by giving to an adult
jo grains of calomel as soon as possible after
feeing him, under every circumstance of the
disease and in v;ry cafe ind'fcrimirmtcly ;
and .repeating it every three hours, joining
opium with it after the fee .nd dose (if it
operated more than two or three times, but
not otherwise) till a falivat'on began to
make its appearance, which was generally in
less than 48 hours ; and that 1:1 every cat
in which faliv ion could be efiefted, the
patient invariablyâ¢ recovered without any
other remedy.
[See his eflay on the fever at Grenada,
in 1793 aB<J '79+ âpage 272-]
Whether this method of treating the dis
ease is more effectual than any other (as
Dr. Chifholm confidently asserts) or not,
my experience has not been fufficient to
enable ine to decide.

The PreHdent of the United States ;s ex
pefted in town in a few days, on his way to
the feat of government ; and a number of
gentlemen propose to compliment him with
a haudfome entertainment.
A gentleman, in a /hort paffagefrom St.
Domingp, informs, that on the night be
tween the 19th and 20th of September,
there was a fevere'cannonade for about 5 or
6 hours, off the Cape.' It was conjeelured
that captain Barney had fallen in with the
British (hips, which were cruising off that
port.
A letter from an American consul in
France informs, that the Ihip Brifels, be
longing to Meflrs. Rutgers, Ogden and Sea
man, is condemned for want of a role d'E
qnipage. Her cargo was very valuable, and
80, coo dollar* were under-written irf this

' The proposition for a union of the new Ve
netian Jlate, with the Otfalpine republic, has
been rejected, by 15,000 votes egainft 35,000
âlf as fame suppose, Buonaparte intends to
ereQ Italy, from Piedmont to the Adriatic, in
to one indivisible republic, and put h)mfelf at

proposed union of Venice -jutth Lombardy.
By the address of Carnot to the French on
the celebration of the loth of AugvJ}, it is obvi
ous thai the government of France is assailed by
efforts to r fit re monarchy. Indeed the late
\ election is a proof that the opinions of the mass
of the nation are unfriendly to the meafuret of the
. government ;if not to the con/litution. But
even admitting the fa 3, thai a majority of the
nation is in favor of a limited monarchy, the
difficulties of refloring it, -which Carnot has
dfcribed, are realâthey may be infvrrr.ountable
and if the present conflitution can cxifl and
prefrrvc peace !>nd subordination to law, good
Frenchman will submit to it, raihfr than rifle
the dangerousflorms of another revolution.
PARIS, June 23.
The new Jacobin club has commenced its
fittings in the hotel de Montiqprepcy.yGuin
guene is cbofen as president ; the number of
the members amounts to 500, of whom
there are 30 deputies of the Revolutionary
Third.
The turbulent session in the council of five
hundred, on the 19th inft. refpefting the
abolition of the law, which deprived the
diredlory of all controul over pecuniary ne
gocintions, has produced different remarks
in the public journals. Some apprehend a
civil war, thinking that the constitution is
menaced with imminent danger of its over
throw, and that from the jacobin clubs wil
(hortly spring up monarchical clubs ; -but
our patriots have many objeÂ£lions against
the probability of such an event. In order
to prevent similar disorderly proceedings in i
the legidatlve body, as those on the 29th j
instant, a committee has btep appointed to '
make a report on the better organization of
the internal police within the halls of the
councils, when in fcflion. The parties dai
ly increase, and in the palais royal conten
tions are conftsntly taking place, which ge
nerally appear as forerunners of more impor
tant events. The members of the new club
(called Conttitutioual Circle's) make <jreat
exertions to gain over the military ftirpsto
their fide, while numerous ancVn>s?rcnyi)s wri
ters attempt to provoke the fokliers against
the ParifiÂ«nÃ. The journals increase the
flames of discord more and moftj and very
probably there will be some serious commo

M.ty, FRNKC,
Your publication refpefting the treat
ment of the yellow fever in Jamaica, is one
of the most interefling that has appeared
ort that fubjeft. I was induced from mere
euriofity, to make a tompsrative statement
of the fnccefs of the' different remedies,

YELLOW FEVER.
EVER since this diftafe made fnch ravage? in thin
i city and New-York, the author has turned his
attention to itscaufes and eure.âThe result of his
enquiries has convinced him that the reason why so
few persons recover from its attacks, are frem its
not being well underflood, and the consequent
wrong method tal en to cure it. He is perfu'aded
that the excessive bliedigns and roercurrcl rentmeÃt
of the Faculty iÂ« highly injurious, and that the on
ly rational mode of treatment is by theufe of proper
acids. Convinced of this he offers his Spnific as a
certain remedy, if used according to the directions.
