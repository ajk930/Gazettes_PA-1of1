" Oil the morning of the jgth, citixens direc

cio. Their wasfupported by their intrench
ed camp at Pefchiei a, and their left by Mantua;
their centre was at Valeggio. Angereju proceeded
to Bos\rhetta, and engaged in a bulk cannonade
with the enemy. In the mean time MLaffena march
ed t> P-fchiera, attacked the enemy in the intrench
ed camp, whiah they had formed,before that place,
WM)' 1 them, took rz pieces of cuvsnorv, and made
7CO prisoners. In cotjfequence of this adtion, the
eitmy were obliged to raise the siege of Pefc(uera,
and to quit the line of Mincio.
" On the 2oth, Angerean pafled the Mincio at
Prfchiera. The divtfion of general Serfurier march
ed for Verona, where it arrived at ten in the even
'nÂ£' j u d the moment in which general Malfena
had refiinjed h? former pofitior.s, made 400prifou
ers, and taken 7 pieces of cannon. The rearguard
or the enemy were still in Veronaâthe gate 9 were
* {hut, and 'the bridges raised. The providator ef
the republic of Venice being summoned to epen
the gates, declared that he could not doit for two
hours. I ordeied them to be opened under thetf re
of cannon. This general Doumartin executed in
left than a quarter of an hour. We fowr.d a quan
tity of baggage in this place, and made some hun
dreds of prifonert.
" Thus we are re-edablifhed in all our former pa
ctions, and the enemy h ve fled into the Tyrol.â

coming from the army,of the Ocean, begirt to-ar

re The Times of this morning so far confeffes its
error as positively to contradidl what it yesterday as
viz. that such a memorial bad
11 been delivered to lord Grenville. But it' so far
perfifls in it*.datement, at to aflert that such com
â¢- plaintt as were dated to be contained in the p/eteud

re the court of Madrid to the marquis de las Gafas.â
r- That the ainbafTador,. however, fhouti have con
y cealed these complaints from bit majedjr's miniflert,,
and communicated them to the condiito. of the

reafbn to dread, that they will liden to no terms

of the nation, with its commercial prosperity, with

power of Great-Britain. Both the partizans of

as may be proved from their writing* and their

t ; Proceedings of the Diet of Rati/bon, to accelerate
a Peace between the Germanic empire, and the
- Fiench Republic.
Ratisbow, Augud 1.
: The progress of the French has induced the im
perial diet, fnddenly, to didiate a memorable advet 'â¢
!of the trnpre for the acceleration ef peace. On the
/ 30th ult. an extraordinary fe'flion as council was )
- held, which was opened by the eledloral diredlory
s of Mentz, wit-ffHhe ftillowing intimation : i
" Several embassies having expressed a wiiltj that
t the present urgent concerns of tl.c war betaken in
e to consideration, agreeably to the rnflrudlions which 1
- they received ; and that ways and means be canfult- 1
s ed for putting a speedy end to this war, the direc
t tory of Menta wouid not be wanting to give an
opportunity for deliberation." ,
n All the envoys, without waiting any further in
â , flrudlioiisfiom their courts and condiments, W>tÂ«L
II and almod every vote was for the acceleration of
e peace. The archducal, Austrian, and eledloral :
Bohemian vete, deviated, however, iu several re
fpeftsftom the other votes, and was to the follow
ing purport:
Vote Â»f the Emperor, tw Archiluke of duflria, and
8 j Elector of Bohcmiq.
y I " The present dilafters of the war, have chiefly
y arisen, because the well-meant admonitions of his
d : majtdy the Roman emperor, to make common and
e well-connedled preparations of defewee hi due sea.
g son, have not been foffioiently 'attended to { nor
a have' the molt recent conclnfa, after the firft fruit
d less overtute9 for peace, as yet been put iu forte ;
r all which has enabled the enemy to turn every fa'.
'â¢ rorable incident to promote their progress, fu puit
e ed by tbeit numbers. A firm and sincere union of
1- all the datet to preserve the Germanic conftituuon, j
it therefore, the only ef&ctcnt remedy to bring ills J

i t
enemy to more equitable fcntimrnts, and lo a ftmi

!jÂ» tutional concord alone, tlx atcofÂ«jjliiluji-at of a
e- fa much desired, general, equitable and jufi peace,
j, | can be with confidence expedted. That his mrfjei
je ' ty the Romans emperor wilhcs nothing more than
ia to put aÂ« end to the burthens of this heavy war,
hit majeily has already p.roved. His majelly's wif
â d dom merits lrkewife the mod confidence,
is r that no refruree of obtaining a suitable peace fiiall
be left untried, and.no favourable opportunity for
re it neglected."
The following adviee of the empire, refpefting
a speedy overture for pe.ice, was drawn up on the
30th ult. antl immediately sent to Vienna.
Advice to the Empire
f > " The present lituation of Germ my having bejn
*â¢ taken into consideration, and formally debated upon,
so all the three colleges ol the empire have deemed
8 ?nd refÂ»lved :

t- vice of the empire already given with regard to that

d meant and overtures which arc the molt proper,
1* and jo realise the speedy ncgociation by adding the
* deputation of the empire in. the peace to be thus

'Â»â¢ In the conference on Thursday tail, some envoy*
e declared, that if a neutrality could not be obtained,
t it woiild be befl to adjourÂ« the diet. The majori

that the llatement was an infamous talfhood.
The charge contained in the extract of the let- t

of this will submit his name to the publiek, vhen- 1
ever the author of the extract shall come forward i
in support of the allegations, so inlidioufly offered

Attack on Newfoundland.
Caps. Gralet who arrived last Suuday.in 24 cays
from Newfoundland, informs, That a French fqua
Â«toon of 6 fliips of the line, and 3 frigates, after
appearing off St. John's, demanding the furrendtr of
tl at town from Sir J. Wallace, who commands
there, and being refufed, had landed .a number of
men at Ball's Bay, a small hamlet, about 30 miles
from' St. John's, and burned a number of fiftier
men's hovels. At which olace they were when
our informant failed. St. 'John's is protested by
two fortsâand Wallace's fquadrofl, conlifts of a 50
gan (hip, 3 frigates and 2 smaller veflelsâlt is
therefore probable if they attack that town they '
will be opposed.

roshad received orders to cross the Po, at Borgp
forte, whilr general Lauet was to repair to Mantua, ;
to give the neccflary for repairing the (
fortifications, and, at the fame time to make pre* 1
parations for besieging the important fortrefi Â»f I
Alexandria and Tor tona. I
The French hid left before Mant*a oni hun- |
dred and forty pieces of cannnn, and a vast quan
tity of ammvinition. Their loss ia the adtions ,
which preceded their retreat, was very eonfidera
ble, and they pafied the river Po at Borgo-forte
and San Benedotto, in the greatest confufion.
The loss of tbe Auftrians in the different aftioos
is stated to amount to 6000 men killed and wqund
- ed, from 12 to 15,000 prisoners, and 70 field
. pieces. This statement is probably exaggerated.
{ The loss of the French, on which, as usual, they
are totally fileut, must have been very considerable.
: The Paris papers of the 18th and 19th, contain
another Jetter from Buonaparte, dated from his
head-quarters at Verona, on the Bth of Augtifl.
1 By these it appears, that notwithstanding tht total
r defeat which the Auftriaiu, in his preceding let
. tcrs, were Ifated to have fuflained, they still raain
-3 taised their polition in the lines of the Mincio,
t and their commu'iica'ion with the town of Man
a tua. From this pofitiun however they appear to
j have driven on the 6th and 7th inft. when the
1 French advanced to Verona, and resumed the posi
tion which they had occupied previous to the at
-1 tack of the Auftrians ; while the latter are said to
] have made good their retreat into the Tyrolife.
e These journals alfia contain some farther accounts
s from Germany. By a letter from Kleber (of jive
; sth of Augu(t) it appears that the French did
not take poiTefiion of the city of B imberg with
out opposition. A desperate aftiotj took place in
â¢ the llreets of the town, which w.Â« maintained with
great obditiacy, on both fides, though tin; French
were ultimtitely victorious.
A letter from general Marceau, dated from Wif-
J baden, on the 3 lit ult. gives an imperfect account
of a sally made'by part of the garrison of Mentz,
on the 29th, which appears to have bÂ«en attended
with some successes at the outset, though the Au
ftrians weire finally obliged to retreat.
On the Bth inft. the advanced polls of the French '
army extended beyond tbe riverâ¢ Aich : and the '
Auftrians were expe&ed to make good their re- ;

We are happy te fay, that there doesaiot appear Â®
to be the smallest foundation fer the report which '
prevailed in the ciry on Friday, and mentioned in 1
our paper of Saturday, that a French fleet' frots *
Brest had actually put to sea. Certain t it iÂ», that |
no account of any such event has been received at
the admiralty ; nor is it believed, by those who are '
moll competent to judge, that the French can fend f
any fleet to sea from the port of Brest. The ac
counts of the failing of the Dutch fleet from the
Texel, are'alfo supposed to be premature; 1
All the Dutch prifee Ealt-India fhipa are purchased 1
to be employed as ftwrelhips in government service. 1
One of the largest is equipping in the river to car
ry over a breed of live cattle of various kinds to the '
island of Corsica. ' '

PARIS, August 10. 1
1 A meflage was yellerday sent by the executive 1
directory to the council of five hundred, to inform
tf;em that Drouet has escaped from the prison of
the abbey ; that his evasion appeared to be the ef
fett of corruption ; that an invertigation had been
fct on foot for the dilcovery of his accomplices }
Si <i that f#om what they had already learnt, it did
not appear that the armed force had taken any part
in that event.
They write from Peterfburgh, that the Ruffian
army, after the capture of Dcrbent, reduced four
provinces of Persia, and took Dofleffioii of Beabe
rabafli, a large and rich commercial city in the Per
sian gulph, where they took an im'menfe booty.
The following is from the " SUN," a London Pa
ps of Augujl 12. .
From the London GazetteâAugust 20,
Admiralty Office, Augujl 20, 1796.
A letter, of which'the following is a copy, has
been transmitted by Admiral Sir John Jervis, K. B. *
Commander in Chief of his Majeity's (hips and vef
felij in the Meditteranean, to Evan Nepean, Efq-
Secretary of the Admiralty, in his letter, dated on
board his Majesty's ship Vi&orjr, off Toulon, July
18, 1796.
Captain, Porto Ftrrajo,
July, 10, 1796.
Sir,
I have the pleafureto inform you, that the treops
p under the command of Major Duncan, took pos
session of the forts and town of Porto Feirajo this
Bay at ten o'clock.
On my joining the eenvoy from Baflia yefteiday
t morning, Major Duncan having done me the favor
! to come on board, we concerted the moll proper me
thoc ror igeedily executing the viceroy's u;ftruÂ£tions
to the major. t
I The troops were landed last night, about one
mile to the weftvvardof the town, under the direc
tion of captiin Stuart, of the Petterell, and the
Major marched close to the gate of
the weit fide j and at five o'clock this morning, sent
into thp governor, the Viceroy's letter, containing
the terms which would be granted to the town, and
g*ve him two hours for his arifwer. At half pafl
u
five I ciir.t on frier:-, wfier, we rereivrd a jreffage
from the Governor, delirii (} | one hour more t6 con
sult wish the piincipal inhabitants. We took this
opportunity to aflure tire Tuscan inhabitants, that o
they flvjuid receive no irjtsry whatever in their per- f
fors or property, 0
(j Having didered the jhips into the harbor to their
several iUtions before appointed, the major and my- e
felf determined, Htould the terms offered i>e reje&ed,
to inftaitly open the fire on the ships, and to storm
the place ofi every point f om the land and sea.
The hsrtnorty and the good feet- I
ween and navy employed on this occasion, a
will, i trflft, be a farther proof of what iray b6 ef
fe&ed by the hearty co operation of the two Â£tr
vices,
t cannot conclude without exprefling my ffitlift
approbation of the zeal a:id good conduit of every f
captain, offictr, and man in the squadron j and, alio r
that during the time 1 was neceffatily employed on
