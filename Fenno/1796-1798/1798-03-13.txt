was then her aim to subdue us not by open v,o em

One clause in the constitution is icized
upon by revolutionary hands, and is declar-

to annihilate every other power and authori

The right to originate Money Bills is al-
ledged to dc the just authority to deftray
and defeat etery executive and every legilla-

for this fuMimation of power. âAlbert Gal-

the sophism, the logic, and the deceptive 1/1

Those who read this Gazette will have J
observed i fort of amicable contest between J
the Editor and the' Frenchman upon the Jof
merita of their re'fpeÂ£tive nations. In this | vf i
difcuflion, the Frenchman was underflood j ms

Now, who but one of the unthinking vul- j
' gar, of the F*-woraen, who afcribcd to
the aristocrats the scarcity of bread in Pa
ris, ar a man ambitious of being vastly pro- |
! found, could think of assigning this, as ai
principal cause of the revolution ! Pitt no 1

] I net, were not displeased at feeing the em-1
I ban affment of a rival power, which had j
j lonjj been looked upon as a natural enemy; t
' bat t# lay thatthey fomented the revolution c '
is too absurd to be believed. Mr. Burke, j"'
[ however, mult have disapproved of this po- )
I licy, nor can I think Mr. Pitt so {hallow a 1
statesman as to assist in kindling a conflag-
I ration which was to set fire to the four cor- j
j ners of Europe. We have, indeed, heard of "
| physicians propagating infe6tions where I
E I '.heir own carcases were secure, but what I Â£

ftul effefted the American revolution. No,'; I
0 their Robefpierres, their Du Ponti and their
Condorcets, are all their own, and the glo
ry or infamy of their revolution is exclu- I .
S * fively Gallic. But even admitting the mon- J J
ftrous position of the Britifti minister aiding 1
the revolution, and that the Foxes and 1
' e Greys, the Priestley* and the Paines, were '
but the dupes of his defiglw, who can be-1
X " lieve, that he is not by this time heartily
j sick of his folly, instead of being yet employ- '
I ed in encreafing a flame which finds ample I

kCITIZF.NS, â¢
The interelt of the Republic comirands
you one more important triumph. After
innumerable combats from which you have
returned conquerors, it remains for you te
: reduce the firlt, the most in tradable, the cefc
crafty of all your enemies.
! The ExecutiveDiredWv desires a general
peace, the Directory wiihes this peace for
you and for Europe. But this year past
, and more, a faithlefs enemy agitate* himfelf,'
(tuns all the cabinets of Europe with a vain
buzzing, propofts with aloud voice Peace
breathes fecrerly war, affefts to desire to
extingijiih with one hand the torch which
he lights again with the other; fcod* with
eclat Pacitkatois, and repels in effeftail
i thoie overtures which alone could tend to a
: ! pacification. This enemy, yuu know that
â¢ | your indignation points him out to yon and
, names hiin ; it is the cabinet of St.Jatnes's
| it is t'ne mofy corrupting and the mod cor.
rupled of the governments of Europe ; it
is the English goverrthveot.
i It is not only French liberty that
this government diredts its conspiracy ; itÂ»
" ' plot embraces the whole world. Ah ! too
longfince, that perfidious cabinet troubles,
enflaves, desolates every part of the world.
Speak, Americans ; fay who are, diredtly
~ or indirectly, your true Dominators ; uu
s happy Indians, fay by what detestable art
Â° that government has eflablifhed its tyranny
among you ; and you European*, mÂ«rc un
fortunate still, innocent inhabitants of the
plains of Fratuonia, and of the lofty AlpV,
innumerable viftlraa of the scourge of com
e bats, fay who lias been the most ardent in.
,e ftigator of this deftrudtive war, in which
have been facrificed move than a million
men, in which immense trealures have beta
swallowed up, in which the rye of peace ii
is ielf iow only perceives on the field of vic
te tory but general misery, u'niverfal mourning,
u- one vast fcerie of despair ! Well !itis in
n- the glare of these eircumftances that the
;d cabinet of St. James's reveals to afilifted
Europe that Britain alone has felt nothing
jn of the horrible disasters. Attend to tii
:ir speech from the height of a Throne !
aE " Our revenues," said the King, Â«' hav
ife continued to augment, our national indmftr
h- has taken a new spring, our commerce ha
â re paired its ancient limits." If the king c
he is then this government intereiled in you
nt diffentions, which alone reaps the fruit n
ire them, which lives by your calamities, prol
li- pers by your diflrefs, accumulates in ita t r .i
furies the tears and the blood of nations
and grows fat on their spoils ?-
It is clear that this cabinet mud dcfii
re- war, since war enriches it. That Govern,
if- merit, nevertheless, in its late manifefto, auc
ia- in its speeches of parade, dares accufc
to France of an insatiable avarice 1 It does not
he fay that the Englifh 1 , firft Devajators of oai
'he island of St. D&mingo, have also taken
ess without a blow the Dutch colonies, altho'
the United Provinces were then their allies,
-ed and that they pretend to retain these thefts,
av- which they will call conquests ; and the
lall king of England speaks to the powers e(
,nd Europe of the ambition of France!
na- But th-s principles of the French towirdi
other nations, are now manifefted ; vague
;he allegations can no longer bbfeure them. If
â the French republic secures the limits which
ave ike has received from natureâif (he repairi
'he in this point the faults monarchy, (he
difdaiut conquests foreign to that great aim:
en- (he does notopprefs the secondary states and
iuf- the weak powers ; (he thinks not of drip
ping herallies; (he is faithful to her fiiends;
iray (he punishes her enemies yet without hating

ici- hate the Englilhnation; and never in France
and will aminifter have a right to the apotheoCÂ»

very body in France is agreed in one point;
on- it is that one is there put in mind of Tou

with a ferocious smile at the disasters of the
continent, applauds its opulence, force it
to pay, conformidable tojuftice, its quota
of the expences of this war, which that
cabinet alone wishes to eternjze, and which
it well knows it may terminate as soon as it
cbufes to speak, to the French republic, a
language that one may lillen to, and that
one can believe fincer#.
Citizens, you will recognize your own
sentiments in the exposition of those of the
executive diretftory. The f.'.me spirit ani- j
mates your faithful reprefentajives In vain
the cabinet of London exhausts its efforts to i
sow among them mistrust and discord, or to
persuade that it has facceeded in it. The
j 3th Frudtidor has destroyed English influ
ence, and since that memorable day, the 1
members of the council and those of the 1
directory present the fpeftacle of the moll
affecting union.
Hah ! all patriots have but one interest
âThere is in the republic but one opinion

ehants and bankers of this cTtyWFPI nj
to a conference with the minister of finance j,
at which the Italian Hero attended.âThe e
question propounded, was " the best man- x
ner of supplying in a prompt, txpeditious (
manner, those means which the wish of the
government and the general with of the peo- c
pie call for, by a descent an England." The
minister asked for a further loan, whieh he t
was certain would not be denied, as the de- !
mand was only for one half of what they e
s,migh'. fubferibe, to be advanced immediate- _
ly; the mode in which this loan was to be a
effefted was the only difficulty, and it wis j.
for this purpofc that the meeting was call
ad, as this loan is quite d'fferent from all o- t
thers heretofore made, he dtfired their as t
sent. He did not wish to fill them with i- j.
deas of enormous interest, nor, at the fame r
time wi(h to intimidate them to fubfei-ibe; :
he informed them of the only recompense r
they would receive inflead ofintereftâThat c
of revenging the wrongs cf our Gountry, t
and punishing the mo 9 perfidious gÂ©vern- j t
ment in the world; to annihilate it; and by ; j
that means give liberty to millions The (
loan, at any rate, should be guaranteed, ,
by government, in cafe of misfortune. It
will have the security in the bravery of our t
armies, who feeroed to have chained victory 1
to their fide.âThey will fiud in the contfi- 1
buttons which (hall be laid on that perfidious j
coun ry, a fufficient profit for their loans.â
The merchants atid bankers of Paris, wiH
not be behind hand, certainly, in efforts
with the reft of the country to accomplish
this much wished for expedition. He fin
ifhed by faying that he was certain of meet
ing with that success, in hopes of which he
had called the meeting. I ,
Buonaparte joined his observations to
those of the minister, and it was, as if by
eleflricity, immediately resolved that a de
putation should beg an audience with the
Directory, and inform them that they*.vcre
in transports of joy at the proportion
The proposed audience was given yester
day with all the solemnity which a mcafur*
of this kind demanded.
Fifteen merchants and bankers were in
troduced to the Diredtory, palling through
two rows of grenadiers, who paid them
military honours, and the mafic played those
patriotic airs which always accompany vic
tory â In the hall were the five diredlors, in
full dress, accompanied by all the ministers
and several general officers. Any endea
vours to serve the country certainly de
serve applanfe, and these. deputies certain
ly met with their (hare, 111 the acclamations
of the public as thty passed the streets.
The minister of finance open.-d the business
of the audience. The deputation, by the
voice of citizen Fulcheron, said, that to
forward the views of the Directory and of
France, the merchants of Paris were dispo
sed to give an example of their perfeft con
fidence in them, by advancing such funs as
they might want, without the hopes of
gain, and offering government the use of
their purses and credit, aud at the fame
time promising to inform their correspond
ents in fore'gn parts of this their proceed
ing, and engaging them to the fame pur
pcfe: that although they do sot undertake
Ito atifwer for their fellow-bankers Jtc. in
France, they offer for themselves, and are
: , certain that the fatiefadtion of
1 j conquering England will draw forth their
1 patriotic exertions-
The piefident aufweredthemin a suitable
â  | manner, and exprefTed the thanks of the Di

j introduced into ati inner apartment, where
1 1 they had a private converfatiori with the di
rectory the result of which we do not know
â  but we are affurcd the two parties were e
: ' qually fatisfied, and that there is hopes the
: , generous demeanor of the merchants and

1 to all true Frenchmeu, and lovers/jf their

That a ftaiement of the cafe of the holders
of bills of this delcription Is eontainrd in a re
port of the accounting officers of the Treasury
made 01) the 24th day of December 1795, in
pmfuance of an entitled " An adt relative

" It is unWerfloid that the fcveral ftites con

In the variou- arrangements which have been
made fiace the efiahliihment of the p efent go
verument, relative to the debt of the United
States, no provision ha* ever been made for these
billsâthey appear from the face of them to be
evidences of debt against ite slates individually
who had ifiwed them, and could not be provided
for by the United States, without raising a
charge against those slates ; and it was reafona
blyto be prefumtd that ihe slates concerned

The prepofni'lll of the Secretary on this fub
jeiSl, wjÂ» not adopted by Cori^rels.
It is a fad notorious thât thei'e bills fjpk in
the fame vertex of a eitrprecistior. With the old
con.inental bills, and white they continued to
circulate were generally in the ratio of lofty of
the old, for one of the new.
This unfortunate depreciation, which operat
ed opon all the paper mone.y nates and certifi
cates, ifTued during the war, neceflitate.l the
United States to adobt principles re'ative ro
them whicb cannot apply in cases <>f ordinary
co'ntra#â the ftajes, individually, have assumed
similar privilcgci; and n making jÂ»r. vilion for
the bills in queltiwn, in some instances, have con
fidcred thera as a depreciated currency.
The committee Â»re informed,thaf all the fbtes
who iffurd bills of this dtleription, have a'rea â¢
dy made provifnn for their redemption, either
at their nominal amount, or at a eeriair, ratio of
depreciation, except the state of RhndÂ«-Jflandâ
i and they think it is fairly to be presumed, that
the states have made as liberal * proviiion as
the nature of the cafe demanded.
The United States have once made allowanc
es to the several states in settlement of their ac
counts for the supplies for which those bills
were ifTued ; should they make any further prÂ»-
vision, thÂ«y must consider the several states as
indebted to them for the amount of such pro
viiion.
From an attentive eonfideration of all the
eireumftanees of this cafe, whicl) the committee
have endeavoured fully to exaihine and present
to the vieiv of the house they are of opinion,
that it will not be expedient for Congress. to
make any provision for the payment of said
bills ; they therefore recommend that the peti
tioners, refptflively, have leave to withdraw
their petitiens. f
This report was advocated by Meflrs Coit
fr """ nppr.Mff Try-*-.. 1 ~| r* .11 t | _
all, Livinglton, Otis, J. Williams and Day
ton.
The latter gentleman thought the report
of the committee was incomplete, as it did
not appear to have distinguished between the
principal and the intereil of these bills. . He
agreed with the comkiittee, with refpeft to
the principal, but was of opinion the Unit
ed States were bound to pay the interefl,
and that as the states which had negle&e'd to
make due proviiion, for these bills were cre
ditor states with the United States, any sum
which Congrefj'ftwild agree to pay, might
be' justly set off againit what was duÂ« to
them. He hoped, therefore, the report
would be re-committed, and a diftinÂ£tion
made betwee the principal and interefl.
After some conversation on this fubjeci,
in which it was stated, that there would be
no end gained by a re-committal, and that
if the report was not fufficiently explicit, it
might be made so, the question on agreeing
to the report was put and carried, there be
ing 62 votes for it.
The committee then rose, the house took
up the report, which after being amended,
by adding, after the word bills," or any
interejl thereon, it was agreed to, there being
62 votes in its favor.
Mr. Livingfton said, he was inftrufted
by the committee of commerce and manufac
tures, to all; for the appointment of a mem
ber upon that committee in the place of Mr.
Swanwick, whose ill state of health did not
permit him to attend the house.âAgreed,
and Mr. Otis was appointed.
Mr. L. added, that he wilhed to a(k ah
explanation of the house refpeiting an im
portant fubjeft. Two atfs ot the Britilh

committee of commerce and manufadlures,
and there had been some doubts in the com

fatts relative to their operation, or to report
what measures may be necessary to be taken
in consequence of this operation, which
would ferionfly affedt the commerce and na

" My letter which informed you of La

his family departed on the 9th of this month

where his brother in law has an dbte.â
There he intends to pass the winter. They
don't speak much qf their ftifferfrtgs. They

' The Emperor of Rufiia goes on with his

l ven despotic and cruel, but well meant and
j said to be necessary. I must not ba conftni

ticularly to be blamed for adding iofults to
his puailhraents of negligent officers and
ferrants of the crown. Their dismission,
or other punishment or rebukes, Jcc. are al
ways published by hreorder in the Gazettes
in very humiliating terms. His orders are
often unreasonableâlately, for example, he
ordered Under severe penalties, that the ship
wherein he was, when reviewing his fleet at
Reval, should be called by every body a fri
gate, tho' it was but a sloop or yachtâthe
order was printed in the PeteriburgGazette.
Yet with all this, he loves peace, order,
justice and exa&ncf* in public affair*. The
Empreft, by her mild amiable temper, is
said to mitigate his severity very often."

enterprize, if attempted, will terminate in the
conluCon anil rniu of those who may be engage .
in it. But his M.<jefly, in his arxious concern for
the Safety and Welfare of his faithful people, ft-el
it incumbent on him to omit no suitable precau
tien which may contribute to their defence.
" Hi? Majeity, therefore, in purluance of th.
a& passed for providing for the angmei ta'ion el
the militia, has thought it right to make this com

that his Majesty may cause the said militia or such
part thereof as he (hall thiiik nec4ffary,to be drawn
out and embodied, and to march as occasion ihall
require." r -

for him to move a general address of thanks to his
