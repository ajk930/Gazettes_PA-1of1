PHILADELPHIA,
WEDNESDAY EVENING, April 4.
For the GMft rt. of the United SrsEf.
TO TUB PUBLIC,
In the Merchants advertiser of the 26th
of March I have read a number of queries,
reflecting Â«n the managers of the Pennsyl
vania Hospital, which are improperly iilh
ered into public notice, with the following
introduction, by a person Who Ogns himfelf
Medicus Studiofus.
" MK. BRADFORD,
" You will oblige a fubferiber, hy pub
lishing the few Queries which follow-
They may peffibly lead our fellow citizens,
to a train of enquiry which feertSs to have
become highly n-*ceffary. It is not from
dislike to the injlitution, or any particular pique
againjl any of its directors, but solely with a
view of procuring the public thorough informa
tion, with refped to the etiquette of the House ;
and the reception of the unfortunate, into this
once amiable injlitution."
In connecting the words once amiable injli-'
tutinn with the above declaration, I am clear,
thai every perfon< will immediately discover,
that the author of them, is not a man of
Veracity or candor, who willies for informa
tion, !ar.d that notwithstanding all his pro
feflions to the coiuraiy, he is wickedly and
artfully aiming to injure the Hospital in the
â public eftecm. I (ball not therefo-ie expect
to make any good imprelfion upon his mind,
by answering his queries, but believing from
the charaCtel of my fellow citizens, that it
my be in favor of that ufeful institution to
do it, I will undertake the talk.with plea
sure, and if the base and unnatural attempt
of the querill to (top the current of charity
from flowing to the destitute poor, and even
to the poor of his own native city, (for I
think I know him) may be thereby prevent-'
ed, I (hall derive a consolation, from my
prelent engagement which Â£ cannot ex
press ; but previous to my answers. I will
thke the liberty, to explain my own ideas
of the Pennsylvania liofpital.
The Pennsylvania Hospital is a private in-
JUtvtion fur the public good, founded original
ly 011 the voluntary contributions ot indivi
duals, " for the reception and relief of lu
" natics, and other distempered and sick
" poor within this province with an excep
" tiin to infedtious diseases." By the
charter, it is. put the care and directi
on of the contributors, who choose annual
ly "twelve managers ahd a Trcafurer out of
their own number, to transaCt the general
business of the house. Those managers e
ia the physicians, and all the servants ;
the cLarter also expressly points out the ex
tent, in which the poor (hall receive the
benefit of the funds, iu these words " 110
" general meeting of the said contributors,
" nor any peifons acting under them (hall
" employ any money, or other ellate, ex
" prefsly given, or added tothe capital (lock
" in any other way, than by applying its
" annual interest or rent towards the enter
" tainment or care of the sick and diftem
" pered poor, that fâ  11 from time to time
" be brought and placed therein, for the
" cure of their diseases, from any part of
â¢f'.tli s province, without partiality or pre
" ference "
Now, in order that the true design and
intention of the institution may ndt be pre
vented, the legislature, the chief justice,
akej of the house of
assembly, as well as the
all of them a controlling power over the
managersâbut no otherperfons that I know
of, have any such rights. To the senate k
home t Repfefrntativcs, they are bound to
fanm" all their accounts every year, and
they are liable to be visited, and to have all
their affairs inspeCted by them as often as
they think proper ; and the charter fays if
" there lhuuld not be a constant fucceflion
" of contributors to meet yearly and choose
" managers, then the said hospital, and the
" ellate and affairs thereof, (hall be in the
'' management and under the direction of
" such prrfous as (hall from time to time,
" fee appointed by aÂ£i of general afftmbly
" of this province for that purpose." The
ccntributors by the charter have a right to
'make laws, but those laws, cannot take ef
fet* until they are approved and signed by
the chief ju (lice, state attorney, and speak
er of the affembly. By virtue of
this power, a law was made in in
these Words " if there (hall be roora in the
" hospital to spare, after as many poor pa
" tient* are accomodated, as the interest of
â¢â¢ the Capital (lock can support, the mana
" gers (hall have liberty of taking in other
" patients at such reasonable rates as they
" can agree for ; and the profits arising from
" boarding and nnrfing such patients, (hall
" be appropriated to the fame uses as the
41 interest of the public stock. Provided,
" that no such person, under pretence of
" coming to board in the hospital, (hall be
" admitted, unless on the nrli application
" made on his behalf, a certificate be pro
" duced, from the overseer or overseers of
" the poor of the townlhip in which he lives
" of his having gained a residence in the
" said townlhip, and unless lufficient fecu
" rity be given to the managers, to indem
" nify the city and hospital, from all charg
" es and expenses whatever of his removing
" hither. The above, according to the
bell of my judgment, are the main princi
ples upon which the charity is founded.â
Having mentioned this, I will proceed to
anfwtr the queries, in doing which, I hope
it will appear, the benevolent intentions of
the legislature and of the contributors is
fully complied with.
I. Was not the Hospital originally founded
and_promoted by individual fubfeription
and public benefaftions, under the idea of
it: being a receptacle for the poor who
were afflicted with any disease that was not
contagious ?
I A. It was. nnd all the interest of the
(lock, is laid out in the care and cure of
( such poor people, and so are the profits that
are made by the board of pay patients ; the
interest will support about 22 and the profits
8, making 30, which is all the poor the
managers have a right to admit at one time
in the house ; since the commencement of
the institution more than nine thousand pa
tients have-been received in the holpital, af
filed with all manner of diseases of body
and mind, of whom abofe four thousand
have been poor people, a great number of
whose lives have been saved, by the care and
attention that has been paid to themâthe
benefits of the institution will be progressive-
Iy extended to a greater number of poor,
m the exaft ratio, to future legacies and
contributions, which it is expeCted will fi
nally enable the managers to fill the house
with them, to the exclusion of all the rich ;
in the mean time, pas-patients are received,
because they help to maintain agreater num
ber of the poÂ®r, than the managers, could
otherways support.
11. Have nc)t private fnbfcriptions and do
nations been liberal in the extremeâhavl:
not the affemhlies at different times been
profufe in their grants, to the amount of
many thousands ?
A. They have been liberalâ-but' not in
the extreme, nor profufe. This seldom or
ever is the cafe to the poor. I believe that
the legacies with private fubferiptions and
donations,amount to forty thousand pounds
âof this sum ten thousand pounds was loft
by continental money ; ten thousand pounds
lie in unprhdu&ive estate, and twenty thou
sand pounds is out at interest at 15 per cent.
The legiftat ive grants amount to about twen
ty-five thmfand pounds, the whole of which
sum is laid out in building the house, and
fix thousand pounds are wanting to finifh it
âthus it appears, that private contributi
ons for the public good, have exceeded the
public granti by fifteen thousand pounds,
and I hope I (hall not be fupppfed to think
lightly of our legislative grants, which I do
not, if f compare them with those of a
neighbouring (late, I will then just men
tion, that the afT mbly ps New-York, have
given to their Hospital at different times
thirty-fix thousand pounds, which is eleven
thousand pounds more than the assembly of
Pennsylvania have given to theirs ; and the
Pennsylvania Hospital certainly is ent'tled
to the largest grants, if the exertions of
oHr contributors may be compared with
those in New-York, which do not amount
as I can find to one thousand pounds.
111. Infpiteof the payments made them
of their money at interest at a depreciated
state ; in which they partook Â»nly in
common with their fellow-citizens, are
not the managers rich both in money and
productive funds ? â¢
A. No, but they are poor; their income
dont exceed 3,466 dollars per annum, and
that at 3 dollars per week, will not support
23 patients at one time ; but the profit of
pay patients being added to it, enables them
as I have mentioned before to take 30 poor,
1 he Institution never can be-laid to be.rich,
until the funds will maintain the house full
of poor patients ; suppose, it will accom
modate 300 at one time,and we reckon them
at 2\ dollars each, per weekâit will then
require 39,000 per annum j this will call
for a capital flock of 650,000, wheread,
the present amount of it is otily 53,Â«3 â
with this view of the subjeCt, will afly ra
tional man fay, that we are rich ? he surely
cannot, but he may fay, with propriety,
we ought to be thankful $ our predecessors
have begun this institution, and endowed it
with 53,333 dollars for the use of the poor
-by voluntary contributions, and not by en
creafing the taxes.
IV. Have not the overseers of the po r (un
til very lately) paid enormous films, out
of the rates fpecified for maintaining
those poor, to-the managers of the hos
pital, for medicines and diet, adminis
tered to paupers transmitted thither from
the bettering house ?
A. The managers of the hospital, ac
i ce.pt of paupers â¢ from the overseers of the
: poor from the bettering house and every o
ther part of the state of P. nnfylvauia with
out partiality, when they have funds to
maintain them. When that is not the cafe
the overfeed, pay for their patients three
dollars per week, which includes evrry
ch rge for medicine and diet, and everything
else but cloathing and funeral expensesâ
, and it is uniformly the practice of the said
managers to fake in such poor without ma
king a profit by them, but in all Cases, they
: charge 25 per cent more to the overseers of
other states. Individuals in low eircum
(lances, and in those cases, where religious
societies of any denomination, or affocia
tions of men, who contribute and support
the poor in Pennsylvania at their own ex
pence, are also taken at the cost. Upon
these principles the managers have always
aCted, and I believe, that which yields a
great deal of trouble and no profit, will ne
ver be called enormous by any man in his
senses.
V. Can a poor unfortunate sailor, afflicted
with disease, be admitted, unless his mer
chant or somebody elfg be security for
changes of cloathing, funeral expcnce3
and diet, and in some instances the ex
peneesof his eure ?
A. Poor unfoitun.te failo s, can be,
and very often are admitted, without any
security, unless it be for cloathing and fu
neral charges ; "they never give security for
diet, unless they are admitted as pay pa
tients ; and when they were admitted as
such, I have never known tlicm, in any in
stance to pay the physician a farthing, if
that is what is meant by expences of cure.
Ncrdid I ever know of a merchant, ap
plying to have a sailor admitted, that was
not willing to give security for hi 3 cloath
' ing and burial charges ; and it is not uncom
mon for the managers & physicians to give
"it for a ftrsnger destitute of friendsâif no
other person will, they will obtain it, by
calling on the overseers of the poor in all
proper cases, and in cases of recent Iric
turcd limbs, wounds or bruises, happening
by accidents in or about the city, a poor
person will be always received without any
security at all.
VI. Can anycitizen.who haseven foryearslived
reputably and paid his taxes, be admitted on
any other terms than in the preceding <l uer y â¢
A I know not of any dift'milion but this be
tween the citizcn&failor âimanageror Physician
will ometimes become security for the f.ilcr,
where he will not for the citizen,for agoodreafon:
The one can obi ge the oveifeerj of the poor to
become security for him, or to maintain hint
elfeVt'here in the cityâthe ether being deftiUitc
of friends, for want of fui h security, may fuffer.
VII. Is not th. hospital a profitable mad-house,
rather tlun a kind asylum for diftreis and
anguish ; and are not two thirds (at least) o!
the maniacs, incft liberally paid fir, to ever)
body interfiled In their cure anJ accomtjo
datiftfi? . ,
A. It is the mod comfortable afylOSi by far
-of any in th* United tatesformad people ; ahd
the so lowing were the rates paid for maniacs,
in January last :
One'was at 80 cents per week
Eight at x
One at 1 11
Two at 1 33
Four at i 67
1 hree at 1 '
Fo&rteen at 3
One at 3 33
One at 3 53 â¢
Three at 4
One at 4 50
Four at 5 and
Two at 6 per weekâin those prices e
ve. y thing that can be nanied, is included to
the overseers of the poor, except burial expen
ces and cloathing, and there is no profit or
perquisites whatever to the managers, not to
any servants of the houft, at : hough sometimes
the physicians are paid for attending their own
private patients who are well able to pay them
& who of their own accord offer to do itâand
they are juftihed in this by a rule of the house
in the following words. " Those who are
taken into the hospital at a piivate expence
may employ any pkyfician or surgeon they
please." Among the above pay patients, none
that are taken from the overseers of the poor
of Pennsylvania pay higher than three dollars
a weeje whjch at this time is only the firft cost
of a patientâthose who are lower than 3 dol
lars with one 01 two exceptions, are their pa
tients taken in many years since, on whom the
price is not raised.
VIII. Jf the hrufe is so poor, as not to be able
to maintain itfelf, why this last summer did
its managers f licit the translation of a ps
tient from the house of employment, firft at
half price, then gratis; that an imputation
might be performed at the hospital, which
was afterwards performed by the surgeon in
attendance at the house of employment ?
Again, where is the p'.ea of poverty, .vhen
we reflctfl, that at the beginning of this win
ter, it was solicited, that upwards of twenty
patients at the choice of the managers, &c,
(hoilld be removed from the bettering house
to the hospital, for the use of the clinical lec
turer ?
A. This quere is predicated on a misrepre
sentation of tafls âThe truth is, that some time
ago perhaps two or three years since an offer
ws made to take a cafe from the house of em
ploy for amputation, not at halfprice, but gra
tis, and the managers of that house would not
fend him for fear of offending their physician,
who rhofe to perform the operatic/) himfelfâ
And last fnmmer the like'offer was made to
take another person, which for the fame rea
sons was rejected ; and again, last winter, one
â  wf-thc- ftttlug liiaoagas u' ilit t'utpttal ga vc an
intimation tonne Â»f the managers of the better
ing house, that probably they could get fix or
eight paupsu transferred to the fiid hospital, if
the cases were proper, as the poor lift werefo far
lhort of the number they could at that time ad
mitâthe hint was mentioned to their board at
the house of employ, but not attended to, and
the reason given was because he doctors Would
not consent to let the physician* of the hospital
come to their house and feleft the cases. As to
an offsr to take twenty patients and upwards, it
was never made, and if it had been, it would
have been a kind one, that for many good rea
sons ought to have been accepted; oii these
refufils I will make no comments.
IX. Is it just tltat the assembly (hould pay for a
very large house, with expensive awkward
marble front and pilasters, when the firnplici
ty of llile in an hospital, needed no such ex
pensive accommodations ; and which were
undertaken by the managers and under their
sole diredlion, and I believe without a meet
ing of the contributors Is it just, or feeling,
that the public funds should be thus applied,
when twice in less than five years, the yellow
fever has almost depopulated our city ; anil
there is no place yet erefted, where a refuge
can be found, or where deserving and wretch
ed poverty tan hide its head ; fufficiently
roomy ana convenient in cafe of future horri
ble catastrophes ?
And yet for this purpose, a tax under the
name of hospital tax is collefted daily !
A. It isjult that th assembly Ihouldpay for
-his large house *ith alt its accommodations
and ornament- because the plan was laid before
the contributors and approved by them, and if
tei wart's it was submitted by th, managers to
the legislature, who also approved thereof and
dirked.th mto build it. After thus approv
ing and adopting the p an, there can be no doubt
they ought to Unify it. As to a tax for luoport
ing the Pennsylvania ho'pital, there never was
"ne laid for the purpose ; the tax called the
h 'fpital t .x, iÂ« for tne hospital tor mfedtious dif
ealrs, which (iiliindlion the reader is requested
to observe.
X. Is the hospital, cseteris paribus, a dear or a
cheap lodging and boarding house ? Would
it not at leafl be honest and candid, to place
under the pidure o*the good benevolent Sa
maritan, the rates at which the unfortunate
are to repay it ?
Luke, chapt 10, V. 35, Â« Take care of him,
and whatsoever thou fpendeft more, when I
come again I will repay tee," feertis to be a fa
vorite text. But as for " going out to tne
highways the hedges and compelling them to
come in, thst the house may be filled," is utter
ly forgotten as well as the context: "Go. ut
quickly into the lanes and ftreetsofthe city,and
bring in hither the poor and the maimed, and
the halt and the blind." Luke 11, v. ai, 13.
A. The hospital isÂ«a cheap boarding house,
and is proved to be so in the answer to the 7th
qyereâAnd the whole interest of the capital
flock, ?nd all the profits of pay patieats. with
e. ery produ&ive fund is laid out upon the poor,
agreeably to the charter, some of whom are
brought in from the hij>h seas, and feme from
the hedges and high ways.
XI. Though lalt not least. Is it not a notori
ous fad, that from the scarcity of objefH,
the melns of medical and surgical inftruiSien
are very confiderahly diminished ? If two
capital operations are performed in thecourfe
of the winter, it perhaps may he the extant
and the trifling number of other patients
BOARDING in the house, renders,it really ail
objefl of indifferenie to students.
A. I kcow not how many operations are per
formed there in afeaf n, nsr is it in the line of
my duty to inquire in;o it âbut I am told, there
wjll be an amputatinn of both legs in a few days
from a froft-bitten negro boy, to which medi
cus ftudiofus would do well to attend, if he is
not alhamed to enter the doors of that ufeful in
ftitution, which he ha, so much abusedâhe nnv
receive then moA real benefit than he will ever
derive from defaming the only asylum for mani
acs that is ere&ed among us for his rountry
men ; as to his iutinuatiou, that the praitice of
the house is become an objeA of indifference to
t!,e students, it i 9 flrongly contradiiltd by at
least sixty pupils who come every year, up n an
average, from the Weft-Indies, and ft%n\ one
end of this continent to the other to attend it.
Having answered the queries, I will now con
clude in a few words. The managers of the Penn
fylv inia Hofpiial have accounted every year, fdr
morÂ«than forty five years past, to the Ltgifluture
of the State, for all their proceedings to their fa
tisfa&ion, the evidencn of which is on the records
of several affembliesâln like manner they have
accounted every year to the contributors, and I
do nor know that the chief juliice. Hate attorney
or speaker of the house of aflijmMy, ever accuf-d
them of mal administrationâTo those bodies they
are as I mentioned, by 'he charter refponfiHe, hut
not to any other perfons,ânev rthelefs they much
desire to latisfy the enquiries of every humane citi
zen of Pennsylvania of the nature and useÂ« of this
inflitution ; not doubting but that when it is well
un<!< rftood, it will be tl)e me .119 of increasing le
gacies an<4 fubferiptions for the use of the sicK poor
us Pennfylyania.
Though nothing can ever be exp-'iSed to pro
duce a goodefi'e<ft upon the mind of Medicus Stu
diofus, who by the whole complexion of his que
ries, appears to be, a refllefi, envious and discon
tented Physician. A CONTRIBUTOR.

The Memorial of the fubferibers, Members of the
General AJfembly of the Commonwealth of
Pennfyl<vania,
Refpeftfully â¢Sbeiveth,
THAT your memorialists faithfully atten
tive to the prosperity and happiness of
their conftituentsj cannot contemplate the
present crisis in tht affairs ot' tlic United States,
without feeling the strongest solicitude, by
every honorable means, to avert the horrors
of the war which threatens : and although
they claim no other influence on yourdelibe -
rations and tranfattions, than that to which
they are entitled in common with all their
fellow citizens, they are persuaded that the
public confidence reposed in them will, at
once, juftify the expfeflion of their fenti
inents, and insure a liberal interpretation of
the motives which aftuate them in addrÂ£fling
those sentiments to your honourable body.
That your memorialists will not, on
occasion, take a retrofpeclive view of the e
vents of the American Revolution, in order
to awaken a sense of gratitude for former fer
vicrt; nor advert to the peculiar charadter of
the European war, in order to mitigate the
feeling of refentmetit forrecent injuries on the
part of France : but regarding only the exit
ing date of their country, its policy, its inter
efls, and its independence, every principle of
patriotism impels them, not merely to depre
cate a public denunciation of hostilities, but
firmly to discountenance every measure which
tends to inflame the spirit of animosity, and
to dissolve the bond of amity with that repub
lic.
That whether your memorialists contem
plate the independent resources of the Union,
or the aid td be derived fiom a foreign alli
anceâthe principfes of a Republican system,
or the means of gratifying the best wish of their
constituentsâthey are alike impressed with
the importance of pursuing a conciliatory and
pacific course. They perceive, indeed, no
glory, no benefit, to be attained for their
country, through the medium of a war, that
can compenl'ate for the stagnation of com
merce, the suspension of agriculture, the ef
fufiou of blood, the waste of treasure, the de- 1
folation of property, and the depravation of
morals, which are its inseparable concomi
tants ; whiie the i (Tue of the European contest
mutt either leave the United States without an
efficient friend, or fatally aflociate them with
the rival of their commerce, and the enemy
of republican! fm.
That your memorialists, under these gene
ral impressions, submit the fubje6t with great
anxiety, but with great deference, to the con
sideration of your honourable bodyâtrusting
that your wisdom, co-operating with thewif
dom of the other departments of the govern

of peace, without the facrifice of any essential
right, or the violation of any important trust. -
But above all, your memorialists earnestly
hope, that while the constituted authorities
shall deem it unjust or inexpedient to engage
in a public war, the neutrality and peace of
the nation may not be put at hazard by au

under any pretence, the re-llels of the United

Mr. Gallatin moved that this petition
be referred to the committee of the whole on
the (late of the Union.
Mr. Allen was fating fomeobjections to
the petition, on account of its purporting to
be from members of the Legifla'ture of Penn
sylvania; he thought no other weight was due
to such petition's than would be due to a peti
tion from forty other individuals ; when
A message was announced from the Prefix

lowing words :

PARIS, January 27.
ExtraS of a letter from Rome, dated Ja
nuary 1.
" We-are yet in a consternation, in conse
quence of the dreadful event which lately
took place in tbis city, the details of which
are doubtless already known in France , to
these we subjoin the following ;
" The Neapolitan ipimfter, on this oc
casion, dispatched two extraordinary couri
ers, immediately succeeding each other to
hiscourt. The Spanifhminifter, who had
determined to withdraw, at last acquiesced
to the pressing aÂ«d repeated invitations of
our secretary of ftatc, by fending a courier
to the court of Madrid. * There has been
an extraordinary meeting to advise what
â flionld be done in this fatal conjunfture.-
Tt is agreedto feud Cardinal Brafchij to Na
ples, accompanied by lord Goleppi, to im
plore the succour and proteftion of that
powerâthose two deputies departed the
29th ult. But what can the court of Na
ples do for us, otherwise than to give us
their councils of wisdom and moderation !â¢
Their intercelfion even, near a government
so juO.ly irritated against ours, would it be
of any weight ?
"We fliall fay nothing of their military
succours, for one hostile movement would
inevitably involve their ruin.
" The greater part of the cardinals, and
other diflinguifhed characters of this capi
tal, are preparing ts abandon ft. In vain
iloes an edift just published, order, on pain
of death, that all the citizens, and all ftran
ger3, of what nation soever, be refpe&ed,
several of tbis last description have already
left the city, and many others are preparing
to follow.
â¢ ' *
" In this frightful anxiety our govern
ment have recourse to all forts of means if
pofilbleto escape fromthe unhappinefs which
menaces it. It invokes the aid of the pow
ers of both earth and
pedited a courier to Vienna imploring the
mediation or succour of the Emperor. It
has also thought it its duty to invoke the
interceflion of the Duke of Tufcany. 11
has caused the theatres to be suspended. It'
hasjuft ordered eight days of prayer, to ob
tain the proteftion of the most high. Of
all our governing people the Pope is yet the
leaft to be pitied. He is in such a feeble
state, that he has been kept ignorant of all
that pasTes until this very moment.
" The 30th Dec. the remains of general
Duphoz were deposited in the parifhchurch
of St. Jean de la Malva.
" he greatest part of those Frenchmen,
whose popular principles are known, have
taken their flight in spice of securities which
were offered to inspire them, and are on
their way to Ancona ; where they will have
ftrohger motives to conceive themselves se
cure.
" The palais as Cardinal Neveu is guard
ed with a single eye by the centinels. It is
not known to what place Louis Brafchi has
retired.
" The pnefts cannot but be in a conster
nation at an event, the-refult of wKiyh will i
be the total abolition of their tyrannic pow
er. In the mean time their malice ceases
to be glutted at the expence of those who
are suspeCted by thefn. Among those who
are arretted, some French were found, who
were however released upon the intercession
of chevalier Azara, and some DaueVswho
owed their liberty to the .intercession of the
S'wedifh minister. About 60 perfQns have
been inearcerees. _Thefe meafurtfs fp badly
calculated, the consternation of the govern
ment, the scarcity of provisions,, all concur
to render the crifi3 flill more violent, and
to augment the force and audacity of the
French party.
" There is at this moment a fnbfcription
opened for the ere&ioti of a monument for
the general, so cowardly (lain by our foi
diers. A very great number of Patriots
have already fubferibed.
There have been a trifling infurre&ion in
several places, particularly around the vic
tualling houses ; but they have been easily
appealed.
By the foregoing you tvill fee the dfpofition
of the mafr of the people. They desire a change
of government ; but they are much opposed to
the excefjes which accompany revolutions ; they
arc prepared to welcome every one tuhoJheill
come and diÃate to them the laim : provided
they might fee the end of the sacerdotal authori
ty, 'which by its perfidies, and its misdemean
ors is become the oljeÃ of universal execration.

The Constitutional committee announced
on the 26 Nivofe (Jan. 16.) that they will

Equality ; a democratic representative, an
energetic but responsible exefcutive power ;
a perfect unity in the government, with
respect to both finances and politics ; a di
vision between the church and state, and
the right of the people to make alterations
iu their constitution.

MR. FEfJNO,
WE havelately seen much in the news
papers of two aftsof the British Parliament,
tending, as it is said, to cramp the.trade of
this country. Indeed Mr. Gries's last speech
travelled quite from the question iuthe House
of Representatives, in order to give them a
flap. He fays those a<9ts " will transfer the
carrying trade from American to British ves
sels." Now I will venture to fay Mr.Giles
has never read both tlsofe afts ; and yet he
is declaiming against them.
One of those afts is for the sole purpose
of giving to the vessels of friendly nations,
a right of trading with the British East-In
dies, which they did not before poffefsâ
and why should Mr. Giles complain of this
aft ? It was because he thought (as he said)
it was authorized by the Brjtifh treatyâ
" Hinc ills lachrymae." Hence all his mur
muring. Let me a/k Mr. Giles to read for
â¢nee, one of the adis he speaks ofâhe will
find it was neither particularly authorized
by,'nor grew out of the treatyâhe will find
that instead of restraining, it ertlarges the
carrying trade df friendly ifetibiisâhe will
find likewifc- that inilead of beginning to
operate, in January last, as he supposed.it
was in force from the 19th of July last, the
day on which the aft passed. This last cir
cumstance is of no other importance, than
that it proves, with the other mistakes, that
the " Farmer" had never read the. aftâl
hope, therefore, when he reads it, and finds
that it has not grown out of the British'
treaty, but is an aft equally regarding all
friendly nations, his particular animosity to
ward! it will cease.
The other aft of which Mr. Giles speaks,
grew entirely out of the treaty. It has
been said in some of the papers, that by
this aft, tobacco carried to Great-Britain in
American vessels will pay a duty of iysd.
sterling per hundred more than tobatxo car
ried in British vesselsâl believe tbis is true,
& this has roused the /arwrViii'dignation ;
but I fnppofe he had forgot we were at least
equal with them, when we laid a greater
excess of duty upon almost every hundred
pounds, weight of British merchandize bro't
here in a British vessel ; and that' a single
trunk of British may pay ;
50 - dollars brought here in a
British, than when brought in an American
veffcl. An. OBSERVER.
To the Militia officers of the City and County
of Philadelphia.
You are called upon in the Aurora of this
morning, rt affernble at the house of Philip
Pancake to-morrew evening on business of
importance. From various and obvious ci;--
cumftances no doubt can he entertaiged as
to the objeft for which the call is made.
That it is to incite you to entet into mea
sures for oppoflng the government of your
country, to induce you t Â« declare your dis
approbation of its conduft, at the most
gloomy period America has ever witnessed ;
at a crisis when its political horizon is clou
ded by the black and malignant vapors of
domestic faftion and of impending foreign
warfare ; at a time when your assistance is
most peculiarly relied upon, and when you
are looked up to as the guardian supporters
of our national rights and as the firm, de
cided, gallant defenders of our national
honor, no one can hesitate to bejieve. At
Inch a time it is surely incumbent on" you
to attend with more than common anxiety
to the effeft which the expression of sen
timents hostile ts our conih'tutional rulers
may have on our public affairs ; well to con
sider whether a display of disunion does not
tend to invite aggression and invafian ; whe
ther it is not eqaally calculated to depress
tne lpirits of our own citizens and to ele
vate the hopes of our enemies : and whe
ther it is confident either with your honor
as soldiers, or your integrity as citizens to
fly back when real danger approaches. Did
you accept of your appointments merely
to shine as peaceful foldicrs in our streets,
or to parade the city in a military uniform ?
I banish from my mind the difgraceful idea.
It is an atrocious insult to your feelings
for a moment to entertain it ; but if you
fuffer youtfelves to become the dupes of
the designing and faftious, tj)e world will
embrace the opinion altho' even then I am
latisfied it would be but a specious delusion.
That you have a right as citizens fully
& freely to express your political
no one will deny, but that you have this
right a? foidiers, is this assertion of a prin
ciple the most ruinous to republican gov.
ernments. The civil military; depart
ments ought always to be perfeftly diftinft;
the military should always be kept in ffrift
subordination to the civil power. As foi
diers you are no: to deliberate, but aft. j
This is the purpose for which you were in
stituted and not for that of controling and !
the operations of government, j
Why then are you ca led upon to meet as
miluiu officers ? Is't supposed thac yourde
cifions wjl] have more weight wb en you are
dieffed in the uniform of a soldier than
when habited in the apparel of a private
citizen, oris it intended to organize you
into a body, of prastorian bands who are al-
â  ways lo be ready to deftrriy the real liber
ties of tSe people and to usurp their r'ghts;
Whatever may have been the expeditions
i of those vfho have made this call, confident
I am that yon will not fuffer vdurfelves jc
become *he instrument of their nefarious
projefts nbr the accomplices in their liber
ticide attempts.

Interesting information from the Gazette
Francois.
In a late letter from London, we find
the following interesting details of the criti
cal state of the English East-India affairs.
" The French government are doubtless
informed ofthe projeft of an invaJion of our
rich possessions in Bengal, which to us is
truly alarming. It is well known that
: when citizen DefcoJ-ches suddenly quitted
' his embassy at Constantinople, it was then
. said, that iuftead of returning tp France,
he departed for Perlia in company with 4
or 500 enterprizing French officers. It
was then supposed that' the objeft of his mis
sion was to direst the operations of con
quering the Ruffians, then in Persia. On
the contrary, the tirft news we received ef
theinvafioo of lndoftan by Zeimaktfen Shah
informed us also, that he had witk him this
said Monsieur DefcOrches, late French
ambafiadoi of' Constantinople, direftihg
with great aftivity all his motions.
" By the last letters from-Calcutta, they
were not without the Â«oft .lively anxiety on
accouut of the rapid'advances of their con
querors, who had already subdued or ratfier
ravaged all the north of Hindoftan, mena
cing also Benares, the frontier of Bengal.
Thus at the moment General Braithwait
departed from Madras, for his expedition a
gainst Muir Shah, our possessions were men
aced from a"fide little expefted ; and if it is
certain that citizen Defcorches direfts the
operations of Zeimakecn Shah, and has
with him the number of French officers it is
said we can no longer calculate upon the fu
perori'ty of our European troops in Asia.
" In fine, 90,000 cavalry, dire&ed by
French officers, and probably seconded by
the French Nabob of Lucknau and Tippoo
Sultan, whose ingestions are strongly fuf
pefted, are capable of striking a deadly
blow to our pawer in India.
'â¢ A remarkable circumstance is, that it
is not yet known in Europe who this Zei
makeen Shah is, and from what country he
comes : If one of the Persian chiefs com
ing from Kandahar, or a chief independant,
Tartar, from Samarcande. The last is
most probable, uo Uis army is composed en
tirely of Caralry ; and their ferocity is such
they spare neither age nor sex."
Under the Paris head of a French paper,
we find an account of an attack on the
Frenjh general Menard in the Swiss territo
ry, in which one of his aids was assassinated.
It is a most Angular faft, that when the
French want to make some alteration in
the government of a state of Europe, it so
happens that some insult is offered to their
Citizens, which becomes the excuff
tacking the liberty of that (late.

i_ EN I R Y
INTO THE
ORTGII OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES.
I 'T'Hfi l.ttters to Dr. Currie, which 1 pu.ililhed I
. q J X lad autumn, led me to an investigation of I
' the origin and phenomena of peftilantial difieafes I
in other countries, as well as in the United St tes. [
In the prof'cutiot> of the fubjedl, new fads ano [
principles continually opened to my view, and si- I
nally determined me to trice back the hiilory of 1
such diseases as far as the records of hiflory ex- I
tend. For this putpofe. I have examined the pub- I
iefs lie libraries in New-York. Ncw-Haveu, Cam- I
ma- bridge and Boflon, with a viaw to obtain all the I
material fails which can illullrate the fubjo&.and I
I have nearly col!e<Sed all the materials for the I
propof;d work. -1
The fads eellc&ed will enable me to demon-1
Urate that many of the common ideas refpe&ing I
_Â£ peflilential epidemics, are unfounded or extreme- I
jj 'ly incorred ; and this in consequence of medical I
mof writers cenfidering an epidemic disease as a detach- I
ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular coun- I
try; rather than as conneded with other epidt- J
â  t ' iat mics cr other phenomena of nature in variots j
tore, p art s of the world. The fads I hare collcde i
irhera | ea d to certain dedudions which are furprifiugto
a ' myl'elf, and whic-h will probably be new to mai.y I
B ". others. Much light will be thrown on this dark I
;rm ' and perplexing fubjed, as well as on natural phi- 1
lofophy.
The proposed work will make a full sized oda- I
II vo volume ; and executed well on fine paper, cap - I

Saliffemry Estate.
r"HE Subscriber, proposing to contrast his bufiÂ»
ness, offerÂ® this Estate (or sale, on moderate
terms. On it are one Blast and three Air Furnaces,
a complete Sorting Machine, and a very good grift
Mil), with two pair of stones; alio a good Forge, all
in perfect repair, as are all the Water Works conncfl
ed with these various branches. The Air Furnace#
were lately built for the purpose of calling Cannon
for this State.âThere are abou* two thousand acres
of Land, one half of which is under wood, the other
very fine arable Land, producing inc befi Hay and
Failure. The Cannon lately mannf*tl*red there,
fully proves the excellency of the metal, which is
(uperior to any in this country, and probably, equal
to any in the world; for not one of fi*tv-nire guns
lately made, although were bored
into 32 pounders, have failtd on proving. The situ
ation ;s very eligible, particularly far this branch of
manufafture, and a place of arms lying in the state
of Connecticut, and only 30 miles from several land Â«
ings on the Hudson's river,and having every advan
tage that can result from a plenty of water ilTuin;
from a Urge natural pond, very near the Furnace,
and which may be converted into a variety of other
uleful purposes. The purcbafer can beaccommodat
ed with all the Hock and utenlils, and have polTeffinn
oner before the firft of June next, and preparation
may be made in the meantime for going into Blall im
mediately thereafter, for every pait vyill be delivered
in good order, with some coal, Ore, &c. &c For
