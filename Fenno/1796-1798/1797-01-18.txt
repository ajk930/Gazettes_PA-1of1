CONGRESS or the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVF J.
Tuesday, January 3.
The report of the comint;tee of Ways and Means
on the fubjedl of the balances due from indivi
dual States to the United State* being under con
federation.
Mr. Williams moved that the farther confident
tiou of the fubjeft (hould be postponed to that day
three weeks, for the reasons which had been urged
by his eolleague yetterday.
Mi. Coit hoped, except some stronger reasons
than had yet oeen given for the pott.ponemcnt, it
would not take place. The conduct of gentlemen
from the state of New-York, he thought extraor,
dirvary on this occasion. It appeared as if they
wished to give thebufinefs the Ge-ty in silence, by
mean 3at delay. There had already been time e
nough for blinking objc&ions forward, if there had
been, any for the last three years ? but now when
they were about to be called upon to pay, time
waa demanded in whi.ch to bring forward obie&ions.
For his part he thought the refolutio* ought le
pasÂ» at present.
Mr, Li'vingfton was sorry the deputation from
New- 1 ! Oik should befufpedled of disingenuous con
duS. -They had explained thcii reasons for wish
ing the pdliponement, which was that they might
have an opportunity to consult the state which they
represented, a.id not to give the business tht go-by
in liletics, as the geutlemai) from ConneÂ£ticut had
; fappofed. iotne of those members did not confi-
I der thcmfeJvcs as r prefeniatives of New-York, in a
j fepijt'ste independent capacity, but in general as a
state of the Union, ;nd that it was uecedary to
have paiticular i..Â£liudtious on this point. The re
port, he said, had only been laid a few days on thÂ»
table j and if -Ins motion had yesterday been in -or
der [or a postponement, he bad not a doubt, from
the disposition of the house, it would have pafTed.
The gentleman from Connecticut had said that
three yean had pasTed fincc the settlement of these
accounts, and *0 objection had been made to it on
the part of Ntw-York. He acknowledged three
years had elapftd and no-steps had been taken to
enforce the demand. He believed indeed that
there was a kind of undtrdanding at the time, that
these debts were te be buiied in oblivion. The
creditor states had had their credits fecu-ed, but uo
order had been taken wuh refpeft to the debts.
He mentioned this as a reason for no Heps having
b fc en taken. He spoke of it however only from
information. He hoped the delay Â«f three years
in the business, would not be brought as an objec
tion against the short postponement now aflced for.
Ii had never been their custom, he said, to press
fubjecfs which were important, when delay was re
quired by any member on rcafosable giound. He
the re fore 1 elied upon it that the postponement would
be granted. J
Mr. N. Smith said, it was never the cuftora of
tbe house to press a fubjeft-wheu there was any rea
fonablc ground for delay. The gentlemen from
Ncw-\ oik laid it waa ucceflary to hear from their
date on the present fubjedt, as they were not autho
rized to act for that date is its individual capacity.
He agreed that they had no nght to appear in he
half of that state individual!)', but he could fee ne
rer;fon for waiting to hear from thencc before the
relolution in quellion was pait. Could they not re
falve to afl; a debtor for payment, without; asking
leave of that debtor i Were they aboui to adopt
coercive measures, it would be reasonable te give
them notice ; but-they Were merely asking for the
money. This, be faifl, was the proper m6de of
doing it, and wouid draw foith their obje&ions, if
they bad any to the payment. These ofbjeflioni
would be given by the slate, and this was the regu
lar way of receiving them ; and therefore he could
fee no poflible realoo to postpone the present quef
lion.
Mr. Gilbert said, it would be recolleÂ£ted when
the subject Â®f thelc balances were under coafidera
. tion three years ago, th,tt there was really an un
derstanding in many of the debtor states, that tho'
it was necefiary that provision fliould be made for
funding what waa due to the creditor Itates, that
there the business would (top: and, when the mo
tion far relinqui filing the debt was agitated, it was
said there was no iJccaUon to pass such a resolution,
as there <vas no diipolition in government to en
force the payment. A member then in the house,'
and who was also one of the commiffiottera, made
'he motion for relinquiihing the claim, as improper.
It was observed by the gentleman last up from Con
Â»eÂ£ticut (Mr. Smith) that the members from N-
Yurk had no business to represent that Itate indivi
dually. He did not undeiftand the meaning o! this
aflertion. Though he eonfidered himfelf as a re-
of the Union, he thought hiraielf par
ticularly so of New-York. In making this claim,
Mr. G. said, the house (hould be aflured it was well
founded. Whether it was so or not, this was the
proper time to shew, aÂ«d it waa therefore necessary
that the reprcfentatives of New-York'fhould have
timetÂ® colleA fafta to shew that the debt was not
a fair 011 c. There was no difpofiiion, he said, in
those members to give this motion he gÂ» by ; but
the fubjedt was of a feiious nature, and requiied
the delay which had been fohcited. Another gen
tleman from Conneflicut (Mr. Coil) had endea
vored on a preceding day to m ike it appear that it
would be the interell of the orher dates tÂ» make
New-York pay the debt in queltion. Upon the
fame plan, he said, it might be the interell of all
the states in the Union to combine and throw a tax
upon an individual state. He hoped the motion
would prevail.
Mr. Cbriftie wished the postponement not to
take place. The gentleman who made the motion,
had already had an opportunity of making a long
speech on the occafioiij and, if the fubjeft was put
off for three weeks, he supposed they would have
the story over again. He did not pofTefs the fear
which his colleague had exprefTed, of imitating the
debtor Hates by a/king for payment. He thought
when they wanted money, they ought to call upon
those who owed it for payrpent. If they gave the
bufiliefs the go by now, they fhsuld never ieceiTc
any thing. He was for bringing 11 to an immedi-,
ate teiminatiou.
Mr. Macon said, he should vote for the poft
pencment. His reason was, that whatever was
determined upon, the debtor Itates Blight not have
it to fay they had been unfairly used. North-Caro
lina could not be interelted in the delay ; but gen
tlemen from New-York had dated that they could,
by means of the proposed delay, obtain certain faÂ£ta
which would throw light upon the fubjeft. He did
not v know that this would be the cafe 5 but he
thought they ought to be indulged, as very fre
quently delays were granted in business of much
less importance. This very day, he said, a post
ponement had taken place in a decision upon a
report, refpeÂ£ting some land in the back country,
on a plea of gaining information ; and surely, when
this liberty was allowed in matters of compara
lively small moment, it ought to be allÂ«vved on a
fubjeft which perhaps was the most delicate that
ever came before the House. He knew it was the
general sentiment of his state that if the settlement
had been a fair one, they should not have been
debtors but creditors ; the postponement was, how
ever, sot too short a time to benefit them ; but, as
it had been defircd by the gfntlemen from New-
York, he wished it to take place.
Mr. Murray said, as a poltponement for three
weeks would not answer any purpofc to the gentle
men of North-Carolina, he wished it had been
moved to extend it to fix. He would, for his
part, vote for any amendment to a measure which
be conceived to be so radically wrong. He could
wish the measure delayed to another session. Poffl
bly delay might be of great value, not considering
it on the scale of pounds, (hillings, and pence, but
on the feore of public peace artd tranquility. What,
from the present temper sf that and from
the accountjjiven by the gentleman from New-
York, jpf the sentiments of that Itate, could be ex
peÂ£ted to be gained by the proposed enquiry ?
Nothing, he feared, but and disunion,
compared with which, four million of dollars funk
into nothing. If a delay for three weeks were to
take place, the jtiftice of the claim would not be
lcfTened, and gentlemen who desired it would not
be fatisfied. And besides, he hoped, if a delay of
one Week rnly took place,' the advocates of this
measure, when they came to look cooly into tilt
would be so fatisfied of the mifchiefs which
would attend the pursuing of it, that they would
be ready torelinquifh it altogether. It wae hinted,
Mr Muiray said, that some of the states vvÂ»ulii
refufe to pay ; but if the gentleman's motion suc
ceeded and the demand was made ifiV were refuftd,
it mutt be enforced, or the dignity of the govern
ment mnft be funk. Had the gentleman from
ConneÂ£ticut, imagined this? But, said he, suppose
the resolution takes place, and the governments of
the debtor dates do not chufe to comply, and yoa
do not chufe to enforce the demand, the liw would
deep on your desk, and the, impotence of the go
vernment of the United States would be seen by all '
the world, and, if you did determine to force the
dates into a payment, you might, in fame measure,
throw them out of the union in their individual '
capacity.
Mr. Murray said, he was not one of those who d'eni- '
ed thejuftieeof the demand; but he eonfidered the
matter more as a great political question, than at to !
whit related to the four million of dollars. 1
Whilst la* was up Mr. M. said, he wn'-UI jufl k(i? s
that he did not oelicve the state which lit leprel'entcd
weuldbeone of those which would rc use to comply
with the demand ; bu', as he never could contemplate
thepayment of the whole, debt by the state, he l'uppol'-
ed the state #f Maryland would make payment only
upon the fame conditions with other debtor states.
Mr. Macon said, tUat one reason for his voting for
the postponement was, that th.- legislature of New
â  York was now in session, and might be immediately
- applied to. For his own part he could wifli the busi
ness postponed for a year .; as never having been men -
tioned in Congress since the fettlemeiit, the different
legidaturei had never taken any order upon the f'ufejeA.
Being from a deb'or state, he had not chosen to fay
much upon the business, and believing, from the tem
per of the House, that a motion for a postponement
of the bulinel's till the next year would not have t,eia
carried, he had forborne making it.
Mr. Thatcher said, that when the motion was firft
brought forward, he was inclined to wiih it might not
be ailed upon, from a different motive, than that
which afluated other gentlemeu. He thought the i'ef
fion ftort, and that they had business of greater weight
which demanded their attention j but he thonght the
reafous which had been offered for a poflpmieitfent,
were furh as would convince every man that the refÂ»-
lutiÂ»n ought to be paflid without the delay of a day
or an hour. What was the rtafon he aiked, why
fame gemlemen wilhed for a poftpenement for three,
others for fix weeks, and others for a year ? Ob the
tfeat there wjs a tacit underftaudiug between the
United and individual States, that the balance would
never be called for. What had been the confequente I
The state" of New-York finding the United States had
slept ever the business, believed they (hould not be cal
led upon, and now, whan the call was about to be
tnade it was said they were unprepared. But if ths
call w<rs not peVfifted in, it would give countenance to
the idea of its being abandoned.
This resolution, >ir. T. said, was, not more than a
barenotifica ion to the individual states that they had
certain demands upon diem. When this was done, if
they had any objeilion to make to them, then was the
proper time to eiiufe agents to come forward and de
clare those obje&iont , for, said he, if the different
representatives were to infor.ii their tia:es what was
doing, the information would be irregular; therefore,
j the fame reason offered by'he gentlemen for a post
ponement, convinccd him of the prcpne;yof palling
the refclution. Why, he fiid, were luggeitions made
that these states were unwilling to pay their debtÂ» ?
He thought it extremely wrong to form such a conjec
ture.
The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Murry) had
offered a reason for not pilling this refoluuon, which
would have some weight in it, if it Was w ill founded.
These debts are not to be callcd for, he said, becaufeit
would eaufeconfufion, and thiow the drbtor i.atcs out
of the union. If he thought so, he would not only
postpone the business, but blot out the demand from
their books But he had nefuch idea. They did not
know at present, that the state ef New-York or any
ether state were difincliried to pay, as the reprcfeuta
tives had acknowledged they had no authority to make
a declaration on the fulvjeifl As far as he underitood
the business, the feulement was fair, just, and honora
ble ; and every motive which would induce an indi
vidual to pay his debts, ought to operate on the debt
or states topjj' theirs.
Mr. Gilbert would just observe, that the gentleman
from Massachusetts, and others, took for granted that
the debt in queflion was just, which they disputed.
He also again went into argument to prove the ntceffi
tyof making enquiries into the fubjetS.
Mr. Williams did not mean his motion to have the
effeA of poftpoin'ing the business 'till next lellion,
though if other gentlemen wilhed it he h. t. no objec
tion. Mr. W. recapitulated some of his rcalbns, for
uilhing an inveftigatiofl of the business, and a post
ponement to lake place for that purpose.
Mr. Claiborne was at a loft to know what use could
be made of any information on the fubjeiSl, unless it
was to dispute the settlement, which he believed to be
binding. He thought to adopt the refoiution before
them, would be til? best way of bringing the matter to
issue, and it eould not fairly be objeited to, as it was
, merely a rt#ueft. He hoped therefore, it would be
[ passed without delay.
Mr. Potter was averle to the postponement, be
cause no fwfficient reason had been given tor it. It
had been faie!, that when the commifiiuners repart
was received, the creditm- Hates had had their creÂ»
dits funded, yet it had been tacitly uuderllood, the
debtor states were never to be tailed upon for their
balances. This, he said, was not a lufficient rea
son for the delay. It had been said, that it was
improper at this time to call upon these states for
their balances. Was there any better time, he ask
ed, for calling for a debt, than when the debtyr
was able to pay, or than when the creditor wanted
the money ? he thought not. If there existed aiyr
obje&ions to the payment of these debts, this was
the best mode of bringing them forwardi
It was said by jhe gentleman from Maryland
( Mr. Murray) that this was a bad time to make
the application, and that it might throw the Unit
ed States into great eonfufion. If this were likely
to be the cafe, it was bell to know it soon. He
had no idea of rclir.quiftiing the claim ; and if tliey
were not to be on friendly tei Ms with the state mi
New-Yoik, or any other state, but by the fame
means which gained them the friendfhip of the clcy
and regency of Algiers, he lliotild not wilhforit.
Mr. Potter said lie could not lee upon what
terms gentlemen ebjefted to this refolutian. It
was a reflection upon the people of New-York, to
do so. Hehimfelf Dad no doubt, but they would
pay tile money when the demand was regularly
made upon them, aj it was their share of the price
of the revolution, and of their ficedom; and
gentlemen (hould suppose that making these de
mandsvwas calculated to -create confuftOn in the
United Stales, was extraordinary. By the report
of the fecictary of the iieafury, they had a c;>lcii
latien on the subject of dirett taxation. Huiy
were these taxes, he asked, to be collected ? VVei e
they not to be demanded from states which were
taxing their own inhabitants ? And would not these
people, if the Hate of New-York and others wei;e
excused from the payment of their debts, have
gaod reason to complain, at thus being callcd upotl
to make good other's deficiencies ? And would not
they also be as likely to Â£hew a spirit ef lehitance,
when inch demands were made upon them, as the
state of New-Ymk whin she were called upon to
difcharge-her just debts: He believed the one cafe
was hilly as probable as the other.
Had the resolution on the table alone been at*
tended to, the present business would have been '
simp!c r as it wag a mere request for payment,
mull have been with the money, or reafpftt
why it was not ,pajd. But the fubjetf had beta
greatly wandered from. As gentlemen were how
ever extremely anxious for a delay of thus weeks,he bad no great oVje&inn to its .being granted, tho'
no Inffieient reafou nad been for it. Mr.
Potter concluded with faying, he doubted hotâthe
honor of New-York would force them to pay the
money-
Mr. Gilbert rose, when the Speaker informed
tÂ»* c Hc*ufe, the gentleman had already spoken
twice, and that, according to the rule, without
leave, he could not be permitted to speak a third
time. Leave was gi anted ; when Mr. Gilbert again
cbjefted to the ju(tice of the claim againlbNew
\otk, and urged the propriety of a postpone
ment.
Mr. Thatcher said, if he had the most distant
suspicion that the application in question, had any
tendency to produce disunion amongst the states, 1
he Ihould be as strongly opposed to it as any man,
because be confideted the union of the states as the
rock of their salvation.
The gentleme . from New-York, who were the
principal advocates for the poftponemedt, did not
agree fufficiently amongst themselves; to warrant
the ijieature. One or more of them, said they,
were not authorised ta aft in the business, others
said they were. If authorised, they could not
want a postponement for inftrudions; and if not
authorised, the resolution ought to pass, that their
state might authorise foraebody. Another gentle
man had laid a postponement was wanted, because
the settlement was not just. He believed it was
just, for three reasons, viz. flrft, because though
the settlement had been made three years, no ob
jection had been made to it ; because the settlement
had been partly executed, so far as to pay the
interest to the creditor (late* ; and because the law
making provision for the settlement and final adop
tion wf it, made no provision for an appeal from
that settlement.
For these three teafons, which Mr. T. said he
had merely mentioned, but which would not fuffer
tar being dilated upon, he should be opposed to
every idea of breaking up the settlement which
had been made.

COMMUNICATIONS.
The contrail between the conduct of France and
Anuria towaids each other, must strike all Eu
rope and speak loudly in favor of the magnanimous
forbearance of the United States. France, Spain
and Holland are impotent at sea against England
alone. Should America be driven to unite with
the latter, the French would in a little time cease
to have ijlands in the Weft-Indies. France must
be feiifible of this truth, and no doubt would con
duct herfelf less arrogantly towards the United
States, was she not ftimula'ed tsÂ» proceed, by men,
whose councils may lead her into the fame thiflake,
whicU similar counsels led Great Britain into.
Your democrat is in politics j what your deist is
in religion. The former writes, or propagates,
whatever has a tendency to excite the people agÂ«tinft
their own government, and p omotc " holy inftr
rcclion the latter, whatever is calculated to de
fttoy the people*' belief in the authority ef the
scriptures, and promote " ka!y itrfiJelity"
It is veiy certain, that the leading democrats in
France and the United States, are atmoft to a man
deijls or ntheifis. s It 13 also true, that we have
political democrats among us, who fttew a difiutli
nation to be religious democrats. To accommodate
both forts of patritts, citizen Bache has advertised
Faille's political it'arks, to be fold separate, from tiis
deifiicul age of reason, for the afe of families.
It b worthy of remark and /ernen hrance, that cer- \
tain democratic publications, hold- up the threat of
domestic infurreftion; or if that fliould be thought too
hazai'dous an experiment, of withdrawiii e from the 1
Uiiited States, in the event of a French w; r, to a 1
country which they fay is to become a French province, j
That monsieur Barney fheuld be defended by '
French writers, and by those, only, even in the
A mora, is a circntmftance truly honorable to the j
American charafler. However Ameticans may
differ about fyitemg of politics -taxesâlaws and
government, in the parties of the union, still it will
be found that no party can one moment give counte
nance to any American citizen who (hall, after
having taken an oath to support the constitution,
leave the United States and retsrn to it under a
foreign coramifiion, and armed with orders hostile 1
to the ftiips and trade of the union. The para- \ f
graph traufplanted into the Gazette of the United I ''
States, from the Aurora, vindicating monficur Bar- i 4
ney, is certainly a French campofttion. The idiom 1 a
betrays the counterfeitâ" he determined upon de- j
pending on, his own individual exertions," &t j 1
" Pusillanimity of the executive"â" crooked po- j

As the American readers of the Anrora daily f
diminish from the just alarm which the Aurora v

Mr. Fsnno, > "
Mr. LOCCENJUS has thrown the gauntlet on h
the quelhon, <â¢ whether a citizen has a right to di- *
vest htmfelf of his allegiance without the consent a
of the society, ot which he is a member f" si
I his question is not so well qualified as it ought
to have been; but in the reasoning he has rested the
ifiue on the point, Â» w!i S ;bct" tlie right to ex/a- ']
triatc is a natural right. t!
e In the complete and iovefiigation of"
a this fu jjcit, it will be-neceflarjr te take man up in
e mis fii It ertate, and in the prosecution of ii, I hope,
<* shall deraonftrably prove, that the arguments ad
rl vanced by our volunteer are tralv chimerical, and
. totally repugnant to t!ie natural rights of man.
i It is allowed by all modem writers on ethicks, on
e government, and on lie hius of nations, that man is
born free, and pufftfles all the natural rights, wliich
i ai-e known to exillin any compaift whatever. The
- ma teiiality of the mind is granted by the philofo
: pliers of the prcfent day, and the free agency of
t man 19 consented toby all parties, which free agen
cy is wholy dependent an unobflruÃctl â¢oelition ; this
, volition resolves itfelf into felf interej\ ind felf love,
5 these are the two positive and fundamental princi
, p' es 'hat govern the anions of men in every fitua
s 'ion in life, these principles of the human mind are
liicr the immutable principles of truths they operate
. on fuciety, and to the happiness of man, like the
â¢ K rsat gravitating principle, on inanimate matter. If
1 man in his primitive and unaffaciated (late, pnflefs
â  thofe-rights, it rests with him whether to ctnftgn or
| give up all of them or not, if he does, they mult
be po/it'tvely exprfftd and agreed upon, for they are
poli'ive f'ghti, therefore no negative teftsment can
1 annihilate a positive one: In as much as this right,
is not expreTed in the C(|mpaÂ£t, it is reserved to
the conffituent. To allow for argument that the
individual may give up this present contested right,
(which common sense revolts at) there can even
then be lituations in which a citizen may be placed,
that would juftify him in expatriating himfelf, and
that all the rights he had delegated to the govern
ment, would revert to hircv, and be have again the
sovereign power in himfelf, as refpe&s himfelf, via.
1 he Lex Necejptatis, this law resolves itfelf into the
law of felf prefer vation, which is jultifiable under
ceitain eircumftaoces, not only in an individual,
but it is morally and politically right for a part of
a (late to dismember itfelf from the body politic ;
aifo according to Wtljius, and other reporters on
the laws of nations, the Lett Necejitatis operates
between nation axd natiou, as between men and men
in their Hate. Iu those compa&s where
citizen does not delegate this right iif terms
fpeciSe, it is retainedâ-For inltance, firft, bo one
pretends to deny hut what man is born free, and of
CoÂ»rfe this right is inherent.'âSecond, that he may
voluntarily give up this right to fopiety or Hot.â I
And thirdly, it is neither expressed nor i-nplied in
any part of the conflitution of the United States,
therefore it is refervsd.
1 his is fe ielt-evident it will scarcely admit ef
pi oof ; therelorea citizen may alienate himfelf at
ail times of tranquillity ; and when he has volun
taiily cut the ligature, he is Men exonerated from
the original covenant, and has the right of eithei
forming a new cÂ»mpa&, or ingrafting himfelf iuto
lorn.- other Hock.

N. 20 leagues, which date, that the fqnadron had
captured a very fine corvette of 20 9 pounders, beÂ»
longing to Richery's squadron, with her prize, a
brig laden with fait. From information of, the
crew, there is every reason to fuppofc that Riche

Arrived heie the 2dinft. the American fchooncr
Reliance, of Boftnn, John Seffurd, mailer, from
Bred, with English men as palfengers, who had
been carried into France. When (he left Brest,
there were 25 fail of men of war in that harbor,
chiefly ef the line, five of them 3 deckers, but
with yards and topmails ftruck,.and in 110 condi
tion for sea, occasioned by a of feamcn.
Men arc so fesree, their fleet havt not their compli
ment of any quality.
These palfengers did not hear any thing of the
intended invasion, until their arrival here, nor doe*
it appear that any preparations indicating such an
intention, ate going on at Brelt j the people in ge
neialthere seem very defirousof peace.
The Reliance on the eoalt of France fell in with

WHEREAS very Urge and heavy debts are justly
ijar and owing from meiTrs. Blair M'Clenachan an'd
Patrick Meore, of the city of Philadelphli, merchants,
trading under the firm of Blair M'Glenacban and P.
Moore, and from Blair M'Cler.acban in his separate
capacity ; to which, by the laws of the all the
joint a. well as Separate property of the laid Gen fle
mc#, is, and ought to bÂ«, liable. And whereas
it Â« clearly and fatisfaiiiorily ascertained, that mi>.
Blsir M'Clenachan,' of the said firm, has conveyed
away to mr. 'John H. liuflon, h-is fon-i*-law, to his
daughter, niifs M'Clenachan, and to his son, George
M'Clenachan, several large and valuable real estates,
as well as ooiilidcrable personal property, in the city
and to*nty of Philadelphia, in the county of Laacaf
ter, in the county of New-Castle on Delaware, and
elsewhere, with a views as it is apprehended, to de
feat/ the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts. â
This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whomfi."-
ever, against the pttrchafe from the laid grantees, or
either of them, of any portion of the said real or per
sonal property, as the molt vigorous meifures will
without delay be taken to render the fame liable to.
the jurit demands of the Creditors.

7TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all persons against purchaQug from the
granteesof Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of
large, reel and pei fonal estates Ue conveyed a\yay to
his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon thefubjedl by a general and
numerous meeting of the cieditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore at of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confidod in the fubferibert by
those creditors ; a step which it would have been a
breach of'duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very iiatcment of the fadt therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindictive." It originated in a defir* to feourc
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of" bis just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
advice oi council as a measure ntttflary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advernCcment has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiliable conduct, not to the iub- 1
fcribers who have merely pufalifhad the truth is |
terms as mild as the fad would admit, and who
meaa to ixveftigate in a high court of juilice the
validity of those purchases of which Mr. M'Clc
naehan fa confidently speaks.
The ftibfcribers therefore are bound by a
of dÂ«ty to the creditor* in general to repeat their
emtion against puruhaliug of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it is a
pnrchafe from any other persons (if such there be)
to wham Mr. M'Clenachan may have made fimllar
conveyances.
