"Of nil tlie vari'#is efforts of the human contei
tm&rrflinding, -for ameliorating the cowditi- laws,
on an J promoting the welfare und happiness al dut
of m. 'ikitvl in this world ; the formation of and ir
civil focietics, and the organization and ad- Bo
r.iiniftration of civil government, are the of the
?r eateil and ifod important. But as ufeful portai
and ntceflavy "aÂ« c^' l government it, to the frequt
fafety and well-being of the human fpec : cs, cated.
its true principles haue been but fmperfo&ly I h
â¢iaderdood, until very lately: And even at ing al
this lite period of time, it has made flower ligion
advances towards perfe&ion, in almod eve- free r
ry nation, than any other branch "of human prehe
knowledge or fcienee. view.
* In vhe enlightened nation of France, where and b
the cry df liberty has, for forae yeqrs past, eventi
been inceftaotly refoucded, the rights of ci- ,-upe.
tizefis, and the nature of civil freedom, seem iTemen,
not to be well un&rftood in theory, and out, c<
tanrh worfeln prattle*. After three foe- renGc
ceflivc attempts, their present constitution, prelfo
in many parts of it, like many of their mail- vereig
ufafturcs, is rpore splendid and hearts
ufeful and durable; and their public fun&i'- zeus,
on'anes often violate in practice, the plained al virt
principles of liberty and jultice. The con- its, w
dust of that nation affords us a very painful ings c
though indrs&ive leffan. Under the foim and al
of a republic, and uiAer the standard of li- fclicit
berty; they frequently perpetrate aÂ£ta of en
ormous violence, despotism and licentious- (
ness. It becomes us to profit by their mis
takes, and to avoid the rocks on which-they Hlpl
seem likely to be.shipwrecked- While we
cautioufiy guard avenues to opprefffon
and despotism on the one hand, let us with (J
---equal caution and assiduity avoid the oppo- Mr
f:te hod mgre dangerous extreme of licenti- was r
oufnels and anarchy, on the other. prayu
In our republican form of government worfti
there is very littlfc danger from" the exercise vernrr
of arbitrary power. As all our public func- meat
tionaiics derive their authority from the peo- j the a]
pie whom tbev govern} it will be the fault not t<
of the people tbemfelves, if that authority is house
ever long abuf'-d to opprel) theip. But our Mi
crtvn expeeicnce 'in fomt degree, and much J day c
more so, the example of all other republics, the c
as well ancient as modern, teach us, the greÂ»t whicl
danger of the contrary extreme of weakness, itfelf
instability,. and irant of energy in the exer- fubjc
cife of official duties, in every department nunc
of government, from the highest to the low- were
eft; from the supreme executive officer down I annui
to 'a conflable. The necessary consequence year?
of which mud be disorder, licentiousness, ed at
and a want of due subordination and fubjec- was <
tion to tbs laws and constituted authorities I there
of government. For that constant tenden- I lattet
cv to extreme equality, that swelling
which prevails in all popular governments, 1 the a
when not properly checked and counteract- withi
ed, by a steady and energetic police, has I lowe<
never yet failed- to produce a gradual prof- was\
tration of all moral, civil, and fcientifical | M
diilinftions in society, and finally terminat- I agre
ed in 3narchy or despotism. This evil seemÂ« j unde
itifej)arabl,e from a republican form of gov- 400
eminent, and sooner or later has proved the lars ;
ruin of every free republic that has ever yet years
existed in the world. It remains for ns, by He I
shunning the fatal vortex, to exhibit one I adve

pleaded by some Fremrii Publiciftsi or by I by
men calling themselves by this name. But I
a cause of this nature, between two nati- I lirr

Let us lay words out of the question j let I no
us consider things. The difficulty coilfilW thi
in faÂ£U,'and it is with fa&s which we ought its
to be acquainted. , Ito
A Treaty of Commerce, concluded by Jftl
Mr. Jay, is the source of the differences I all
which we have to investigate. This Treaty I thi
was concluded. atÂ» JLondon on the ift No-I ftr
vcmber 1794 'â  wa'r ratified by the S-nate wi
oftheUmted States, withtheexceptionofone ry
article,upon the 24th June 1795. The fol-1 ad

treaty: I of
It is well known bhat there exist among I ty
the Anglo-American9 two declared parties.: cl<
i the'oue torififts of the merchants, and tin-1
I fortnnately of a majority in the government j thi

i The mass of the people is more inclined to len
the cause of France, and to the principles I th
whieb dictated,the revolution. The latter Ige

understood to aSuate the twb~parties. | E
1 It is melancholy to discover, in every Jin
1 age and in every country, the eternal con- I E
- test occalioned bythis division of the human Jth
1 mind between the ariftocratical and, demo- IFi
cratical spirit. The States of Greece for-1 e/
e inerly experienced these oscillations, which lar
e were also the torment of the Roman Re- j- w
1 public. The universe feenis abandoned to J w
- fyfterti of these two principles. I ol

n the two. , palfHi i> i:: ? 5 . ~lÂ«i
â¢ ' It is well known that the French have I G
s contribuud in America to the triumph of Ipi
the better Genius. By a definitive treaty I U
e concluded at Paris in (783, England re-1 yi
r. cognized the independence of Americaâ Isa
e This treaty fixed the limits and some other I r:
â  points. jtl
n Up to the commencement of the present Ith
c war, these obje&s had excited- some differ- I
e ehces. The troops of -the King of Eng- Jtl
s land had not observed the lines of demarca-1 ti
e tion traced by the Treaty. The Englilh I w
1- had carried off the negroes belongingto the 1 p
y United State?. Some American vessels, by Jc;
t. virtue of orders iffoed on the 6th of No- Ifi
1- vember 1793, had been pillaged and taken Itl
n by Esg'iHh vessels, under pretence that they |ti
3, carried on traffic with the French Weft-li> Ie;
y dia iftands upon a different footing from b
- that eftabliihtid before the war, &c. The If(
n last fleet awakened the American ship-own- J 1
in ers : they every <riiere protested againfl this I ti
in proceeding. In thflegiflature cries of war 1 h
is were keafd, should the grievances of Ame- I t
it rice not be redressed. The government pre- \p
â h' ffrred mode of conciliation :âa Nego-1 I
of ciator was sent to London, and the choice t
a fell upon Mr. Jay. I
10 The GJiraniquc asserts, that at London 1;
of Mr. Jay allowed hlmfdf to be circumvented t
>0 by the Ministers, the "Courtiers, the Noble t
en 'Lords. Stunned,befides, by the complaints c
of imaginary grievances which the British r
Minister rung in his ears, he forgot that he t
:i, himfelf was sent to state the_ grievances of
E- his fellow-citizens, and that he came on pur- t
ie, pose to procure redress. He saw ho other t
ps- means of extricatiug timfelf from this la- 1
ra, byrinth but to solicit the concluiion of a 1
or- treaty of peace with England. (
at- .Here begins the return of the bad prin- (
in- ciple into the affairs of Arnerica. This j
'an treaty favors, in a decided manner, the in- ]
|,O. tereftsofEngland, tothe prejudice of France 1
3nd several other powers, such as Holland,
n,t, Prussia and Sweden ; and it openly violates
ne, in federal important articles, the preceding
3a* treaties between France and the United
ad- States.
'vis, We here should observe, that a treaty
ou, x ofcomtrterce, favourable to the Americans,
an, negociated by Franklin, and Lee,

ids articles'are thole which contain the raoft
he grievous clauses, â¢ tht stipulations which are
Js, in moll dired violation of the treaty of
>n- 1778. It will be neceffarv, in the firii in
lys stance, to read- the text of the article of
)n- this said treaty :
in "It (hall be lawful to the (hips of war
led and privateers of either power, to convcv

the prizes, or enter into any scrutiny as to their
ies, legality ; but they,-tf>e of war or

ans. Ih,is la it clause was evidently, between
t in America and France, a fort of privilege,
ing, by which every other nation was excluded,
cori- It was, indeed, the only diftlnguiihing fea
ced- ture of the trecty wimli denoted the g<u>d
I'niv- will us the Americnur: towards the French,
ight Why, and how did the two nrstiens then a
viag vail themselves of this exefufne pi-ivilere ?
We It was, gs Idisbeen said, at a time when A
the rrrerica was resolved to make constantly a
s ar- cor.virori catiie with the Trench, and con
linth lidered tliK the Englifli could art be kept

iave greatly cmbr.rrafFed the American ara- }
.lUador. Lord Grenviilc required that
-t.ng.and should be treated as the most favor- â¢
ed nation : a little finefle got the betyr of i
this embarrassment. The above article, ac- j
cordiHgly, M the treaty of 1778, wis co- !
Pfcd, nearly word for word, in the treaty!
or 1794. thus, on the' one hand, the 1
French are constantly the possessors of this â¢
exc[ufrje privilege, the etclufivt pofTelfion of
which England acquires. We cannot fail
to admire this fubllety! * {
Mr. Jay, apparently apprehenfire of the j
clamours whiclj would naturally be excited |
by so formal an irifra&ion of the Treaty of
Paris, took care to introduce into that of
London a reftridtion, which it would not
be amiss to quote :
" Nothing hCe contained shall be either,
interpreted, or shall operate in a manner
contrary to public Treaties, ancient or ex
iting, with other sovereigns or States.
And the two contrasting Parties agree, that
in future there shall not be formed, by ei
ther of them, any Treaty which shall not be I
compatible with'the present article." j
Can a more scandalous and wretched f
quibble be fgund any where ?â ' Is y not this S 1
modification, v.ij.h which however," the A
mericans appeared to be fatisfied, absurd in 1
the extreme? How can such a clause be re- ;
conciled with the two other articles? If â¢
the English, coming with a French prize I
into ah American port, are -received in that <
port, the Treaty of 1778 is infringed; if '
.# they are not received, the treaty of 1704. is 1
infringed.
The stipulations contained in the articles <
which have bees prccedingly analifed, might 1
at leail, notiiave depended altogether on the ,
will and aft of the United States, but this |
/ onc is their fide, a formal, free and vol- c
untaryconceflion âWhatever fubtletiesmay 1
be employed to cover this want of good faith 1
it is not lefe certain, having fub
fdnbed thfc article of the firft treaty, the A- r
mcricans could not, without a palpable vio- v
lation of it, fufclcribe the second. 1Â«
From these fafts, it appears to be a mat- n
ter of surprise that a Legislator of France *
should enter into a former defence of the - j
treaty of 1794. It is essential that these na- w
tions, reduced to fimplc terms, should.be l<
eftabhihed, to the end that the conduft
which the French government ought to ob "
serve at this time toward the American ne
gociators should be appreciated.

THE Managers particularly requc-ft the con
currence of the puWic in the abolition of a (
cnf'ooi. !Â»s hitherto obtained, of giving a
wav or di.poftng of'RETURN CHECKS at the , <4
Theatre.
Th,L-y are that gentlemen are unconieious
of ai:y wi nng donr to t e interest of the inftitu- 1
tion by tliupradi.r , from a general, though raif
takcu Idea that ChectiÂ« are the repreSrstatiees oi a L
right to fu n,a:iy feats in tbe Theatre, during au
Enteftaiiiment, and transferable at will,
when in fad, they Were never intended as more
than hlwV which the ll&or-keepws are enabled &]
to afcoruin with the i -aft troubles ihe/>ar/Â«Â«,tbHt
titj tbtmfi'i* have neen before in the lhcatre, or
paid for their admifli-jn.
Indepcodwt of the injury the Manager- sustain, Â»
such a pra&ice encourages a croud of i:Ue hoys and
other difarderly psrX"U. to fuirocnd lie ibicr? s>f â 
the Theatre, to the corruption of their moral* and
the great annoyance of rhe Audience. n -
It ha-, also been tiÂ»e source of two evils of 110 in
copfidtrable magnitude; one i~, that fonetimes w
very impropÂ»r conipany is by these n'.cani admit- Q]
ted ; and the other, that owin s to Checks pafEng
iuto dilhoneil hands, they have be n w
counterfeited to a large amount for the purpoftsof c
sale
This will, it isrefpeilfully hoped, in- -
duce the I'ublic to discourage such a traffic : and j
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus afiifted,
easily adequate r o its entire abolition.
