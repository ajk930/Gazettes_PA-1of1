SATURDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 4.

Ffor the Gavrtti of the United Si{ales. I*
/ mk. riNao, tjiou
Although difnlerejled benevolence is held t J' e
by/many to be an ideal thing, yet when * 01
we find individuals stepping forward in a Coltl
pUhlic cause, to encounter perils, under cir- tran
fnmftances which admit of no adequate re-
their conduft unquestionably ap- <( l U|
; proaches very near to this idea.
It is obvi6us that this rcfle&ion points * r .Â® r
particularly to the conduft of those phyfi- Hl S'
ciatis of Philadelphia, who have abode the '" r|l
(hock of the fiver. The death of several .
valuable members of the profeflion, who 111
have fallen vi&ims to the pestilence, is a at a
fufScient evidence of the hazards encoun
tered by all those who have attended to the 5*
calls of the afflidted ; and while the feeling ''' u
heart deplores the loss of a Way, in pii- v y cl
vate pra&icc* and of Dobel and Plea- the
â¢sants, in the line of public duty, it is led rat *
to form a high ellimate of the merits, both
'of the departed and the survivors.
But it is to the public hospital, where J en
' the fever has been encountered in all its alt
j moll malignant forms, that our attention is P '
j attrafted to the moll exalted contempt of '
\ danger, in the exertion of a generous be
nevolence. Drs. Stevens and Duffield . 1
here demand our most feeling acknowledg- int
pients, and our most peculiar regard.
.So some paflenger, efcap'd the pelting a v
of the pitiless ftorm,âfrom perilous blasts n<ll
which /hook his fragile bark, cheerily greets
pilot and the hardy mariner, but
for whose courage and whose hazards he t0
had bee* immersed in the briny wave.
An INDIVIDUAL. S"
Ri
From tbe (N. r.) COMMERCIAL ADVER TISES. clt
A friend has put into our bands a pamphlet by vc
the edifcr of the Maritime Courier, printed in an
Havre-de-Grace, entitled, " Observations on the
capture of the Juliana, capt. Hayward, &e."â lie
, The writer's remarks are pointedly severe against Â£
, the proceedings of the French tribunals, agjinft Â°
the d-reftory, and Merlin, minister of juflice; P 1 ;
: while he bestows great piaife on the tribunal at wl
f Havre, for pronouncing the seizure illegal He so
reprobates the idea of Merlin, in his letter to Mr.
Skipwith, in which he tells him, that the Amcri
can government ought to break the incomprehrnG
ble treaty with England. The writer declares it
impoflible for the Americans to tread back their I
steps, and impolitic in the French governmeot to ra
demand if. He docs not juftify every particular Jjl
e in the treaty with Great Britain ; but under the
B cireutnrtances, he seems to think it politic in the
c American government to have acceded to it. He J
mentions the benefits of recovering our western w
" posts, and indemnification for spoliations. He ol
k proves that it is impolitic in our government to
wage war with England, and still more impolitic
2 in the French government to compel us to join S. , j
Britain against France.
Ihe writer feya that ont of the wh.le of the u
wieck of the navies of France, Spain and Holland, IT
not half the number of (hips fan be fitted for sea, Cl
which England has in commiflionâAnd while
France can offer the Americans no aid en the ocean,
file cannot frighten them by menacing them with 5'
war. He remarks that the Americans will not 1S
be terrified, until the French navy is in a condi- e
tion to transport to our country the Moreaus and w
the Buonapartes, and their brave troops. j
The writer declares that the French, under the .
d decree of March id, seize and confifcats the Ame
rican property, in violation of alllbtformt of juJUcc. tl
He proceeds to state th- conferences of a rup- d
ture between France and the United States : which r(
would be te deprive France of our trade, and throw
more of it into the hands of the Englifh.âAltho'
wÂ« have no fleets, yet, fays the writer, very just
ly, we could fit out great numbers of small ves
sels, which would cruise about the French and
le SpariiflÂ» possessions, and cut off all supplies.âThe
le Spanish provinces offer a field for plunder and con
be quellâsupported by the Britilh marine, which 1
rC would be supplied with American mariners, they
a- might effsdl the conquest of Florida, Leuifiaia and
k, Mexico, aÂ»d who knows, fays he, if the indepen
dence of the Spanilh provinces might not be rea
lized before the end of this war !
The author proceeds to prove that the regula- ,
tions of July Â»6,1778, which the decree of March
ad has revived and enforced, are altogether inap
'd plicable to the Americans. He observes those re- c
gulations were made refpeding neutral nations, J
â¢ot alliet; and that allies mull be governed in their f
intercomrfe by existing treaties. He fpecifies two ,
articles of the regulations of July %6, which are
expressly contradiflory to the treaty of 1778 â c
and therefore it never could have been intended e
1 that those orders should be extended to the United t
it, States. r
el- On the fnhje& of the Role of Equipage the *
r â writer has given an explicit-opinion, which we
stall cite at some length.âAfter citing the 15th '
and 17th articles of the treaty, he fays " when v
an American Ihip meet* a privateer, she is to ex- t
n Â» hibit her certificate of lading and her paflport ac- Â£
' e i cording to the mode annexed to the treaty, and
ral the privateer,which,after such exhibition, Hops the r
nd vessel or fends her into port, and libels her, is a. '
of violator of the laws, a disturber ot public order ; 1
ar- for such injuries may lead nations into a disastrous (
to- war. The words of the 17th article are so clear, j
that it is impoflible to conceive with how little mo
irn, defty any thing more is demanded than the certifi- '
cate of lading and the passport. The paflport is '
the only paper essentialâit proves the ship to be I
Americanâthe captain to be an Americanâthat j
(he is from an American port and bound to a neu- (
tral port âIt is infpe&ed by the oflieers of the ma- ,
the rine, who attcft that oath has been made of the
'ke property.
nft But at the fame time that the captain is bound 1
edi to make oath to, in order to procure the deliver- {
ance of the paflport, ht is also Uwd to tnUr in the
ogicttLt hjl of tit crttv and hit pajengert, whom he
will not take on board without the knowledge and
[ a , permifiion of the officers of the marine.
The captain is not touni to frifmt tbe lifl a feconi
time, nor to carry it -with bim ; be ought to dcpofit itl tbe
Ibe bands of tbe effictrj of tbe marine, and it is after tbat dt
' of foftt of tbe role and tbe completion of the dul iet required of
10 him, iy tbe form, tbat the passport it delivered to bim.
Tbe passport in the hands of the Â»fficers proves
that the captain has complied with all the maritime
I- regulations of his country, in the fame manrer
that passports, with which travellers provide them
irn felvcs for leaving France, ateft that they have sub
mitted to all the forms required by the laws of the
icpulslic.
If thciole of equipage wereneeeffary, the 17th
article would have expressed it, but when it speaks
only of a Passport according to the form, which it re
quires only to be deposited with the officei s of the j
V marine in America, it is obvious that the Amen- j
cans arc within the rule, when provided with the .
passport."" ... . . '
o Such are the ideas of this judicious writer ; and
ins, if he is right, the usual form of the paflport is de
bit' fcftive. According to his idea the Role of equi
page (houldbe deposited at the cultcm house, and
Ihe passport il'.ould exprcfs that it is deposited

From the Western Teleoraphe. faftu
It has ever been the objeft of every vir- are
nous legislator, to grant the .members of frorr
be social state an equitable exchange for land
hose natural rights, which, by implied upoi
ompaft, they relinqftifh upon their en- the
ranee into society. , ; j men
In the Roman republic there was no the <
quitable exchange the plebeian, though I
neritorious, was conditionally excluded fuel'
rom holding an office ; whild ths mod pro- port
ligate were tstifed to the raagiftracy by for- (hip
;une and antiquity of family. An accurate gatt
Roman historian informs us, that the mod cept
nfaraous candidate had a favourable chance as a
it 9n eleftion, if he could shew the antique deft
latues, and recount the difintereded aftions, lane
if his ancestors ; âinfenfible, that the more cud
illustrious the aftions of his forefathers pay
were, the greater scandal redounded upon of
the fhamefal deportment of their degene- . upo
rate poderity. : in I
Thus the Senate was, at different peri- ' cou
odj, composed of the mod contemptible, ties
venal men : avarice and ambition abolished mer
faith, probity, with every virtuous princi- â¢ defi
pie. Ambition forced them to be deceit- gou
ful, to conceal their real meaning ; to pro- dut
fefs what they meant not; to sftimate friend- 011 1
(hip and enmity, not according to their own \ any
intrinsic weight, but by that of intered, any
and rather to bear a fair countenance than dul
a virtuous heart. Avarice, a vice impreg- ne*
nated with mortal poison, had enervated j his
every member of that once refpeftable bo- 1 aft
dy, and influenced the mod didinguifhed tor
to prostitute their abilities. I in
So flagrant was their venality, that Ju- j du
giirtha, the mod abandoned ally of the po
Roman republic, when departing from the j th<
city, exclaimed, " A city abandoned to I me
venality, and ripe for perdition, whenever j of
an able purchaser would appear." j kii
But their exqefles were now at their 1 cei
height, and the insulted populace made vi- ex
gorous efforts to regain their freedom. Po- | liv
pular rage, by being long fniothered, burd I or
with tenfold fury upon their former oppref- qu
fors, enabling a law that the senate should co
be bound by oath to accede te every pro- m;
pofltion, which the people should fugged, po
however prejudicial to the eommon weal, j va
The balance of power not only preponde- I
rated now upon the fide of the commons, I pr
but the very foundation of the government I th
was removtd, and a dominatio plcbis, or lan
tyranny of the people, introduced, which I tii
was followed by the arbitrary usurpation m
of a single person. I g'
We enjoy a form of government raised fa
upon the drifted principles of reason and m
humanity : merit, in every republic raised so
upon similar principles, will generally be the I bt
mod patent road to preferment, as fortune in
cannot confer an office, nor hereditary tinsel U
to attraft the people. Let us beware of B
confidently every ordinance despotic, which I g<
is inconsistent with our peculiar sentiments ; I m
every law oppressive, which is incompatible I as
with our private intered. The word free-1 m
dom founds harmomious and pleafixig to I cc
the ear; but that we may enjoy not only Ip<
the found, but the salutary effefts of free- fh
dom, and these permanent, many redriftive in
regulations are necessary in the social date, w
which fanatics will deem oppressive. p;

mill, in complete order, and at work ; gentlemen, too, who

are soli cited to encourage andfuppnrt this sage (by which
they can be so well accommodated) the continuance of which
