ker, had some converfati.jN with Up'on and auoth- â 
er man refpe&ing an airguu. The other man t, Id
liim he wa# very fond ot (hooting : and had 101 l
iomeof lingers by the firing <.f a gun.
A Mr. Palmer, of Barnard's Inn, had known
'-.Crofsfield 15 or 16 years, and had accompanied him
and L'pton to the different brass founders already
mentioned, but said lie did not understand the na
ture of tlie bjfirefg, and that it was refpeifting Up
ton's business that they called at these different
brass founders.
John Hail), turner of Bartholomew close, said
that he was a member of the Lor* on Correspon
ding Society, and belonged to the 6th division.â
He knew Upton and Palme- in Sept. 17:14. They
and a stranger came to his hfiufe at that time, and
having a(ked him, whether he could turn io wood,
a sketch was made out by thr stranger and himlelf,
agreecble to their directions. He believed the
Iketch was the fame as that produced in Court It
wasdotie in irk before him, and was drawn out 011
the back of a bi|l sot letting lodings. Having
ed what it was intended for, he was informed by
them that it was meant to be used in an electrical
-machine. He fjjid, on his cross examination, that
Upton had been disgraced in the London Coiref
ponding Society by Higgins and Le Maitre.
Ihe Loid Chief Jultic obferveo, that it was un
necessary for the prisoner's Counlrl to invalidate,
what was not in fait before the court âtheteltimo-
nyof Upton.
Mr. Adam having argued that point at some
length, the chief justice said, that as Upton's de
claration was that of a man not upon oa h, it for
med no evidence whatever: '
After some arguments bet .veen Mr. Garrow.the
attorney general, and Mr. Adam, on the propiiety
of producing confeffional'evidei.ce to r(tablift) she
guilt of the pr fiiner, the court decided that mea
sure in favor of the profeeuiion.
The firft witness called was John Le Briton,
who said, that he was boat fleerer.to the Pomona
South Sea-whaier, and failed from Falmouth 011
the 13th of Feb. 1796. The prifoner,CrofsfieH,
came on boaid as fargeon, a.week before the (hip
failed-from Portsmouth, which was on the 29th of
Jan.* He was not at that time acquainted jvitli the j
name qf the prisoner, who generally went by the
name of the dodtor. The Pomona was taken on
the ijth of Feb. by Le Vengeance Nafional cor
vette. The prisoner, with some others, was put
on board v the corvette, and the witness beard him
fay, on quitting the Pomona to go on board the
Frenchman, that he was happy at going to France
and much better plcaf. Jon that account than if he
were to return to England. He had never heard j
that the prisoner's name was Crofsfick), till his ar '
rival at Brest, which Kappened on the 23d of Feb.
ThrV were often in company 'oge her in the poison- \
<hip at Brest, and be heard Crofsfield fay, that he
was one of those who invented the air gun to af
f.ifiinaie his majetty. The witness aflted him what
the gun resembled ? 3nd he said, that an arrow was
to be driven through a kind of tube by the force
df i: flammable ait ; thr arrow was represented to
be like a haipoon used in Ariking whales. They
were, after some time, to be sent home in a cartel,
and the prisoner then assumed the name of H.
Wilson ; and put his own name down the second j
in the muster lift. He embarked for England in
the eartel ship by the name of H. Wilson, and was
described in the mutter lift as belonging not to the
Pomona, but to the Hope.
The witnefle* being crots-rxamined, admitted
that he and the prisoner went on shore together at
Portsmouth, and walked publicly about the fy-eets.
Thomas Denis, chief mate of the Pomona, said
the piifone# had declared, aftei they had failed,
that if Pitt knew where he was he would fend a
frigate after him. He acknowledged thatie was
privy to the delign of getting his majesty afT.iffi
nated at the play houfr, and knew how the dart
was conftrufted. The prisoner also said to him,
that if Piit had come over any other bridge than
Westminster bridge, he would have-fceen shot.
When he airived at Brest, he boalted that he had
no longer any occasion to bu ashamed or afr:<id of
his nameâDennis then corroborated the evidence
of Le Briton with iefpeÂ£t to the prifoner's*cbang
ing hi* name'tp Wilson.
Mr John Winter, owner of the Sufan'nah, frotr
Newfoundland, and earned into Brett on the 13.1
of December, said he was introduced to Crofsfic h
oil Iward the Revolution piifon ship at Brest. Tht
ptuufKT told bitn Lis name wai Tom Payne, and
f *
â  Â»laughed heartily. He cor,felled he had itat at
his majesty near Buckingham honfe. and had mu
. fed him.- ' The witness was often in company with
he prisoner during Ihe fpasc of five months at
Brest, and Crofsfield told him that he had invented
the pop-gun, which he dcfcribed as Â»tnbe about a
foot and a half long, ma le for the purpose ol dif
t- charging a poisoned ariow, which was to make lii->
f maielty expire in the greatest agony. The prifun
â A tt said he could kill a man at the distance of 3 dr
c- yards will it, and without any Boili. This
r language was used Crofsiuld very often : |>er
n haps 40 or 50 time% and in the presence of feve
B-* ialo'hers. He declared, that he had ordered rhe
e poison to be mixed at the Che,nirt's. Ef sometimes
â¢y said, that miffing his majrlty was vtry u duckv,
n- and fometimcs I hat it was dââd unlucky. He
a- Jiope.l that he Ihould fee the day d/hen the llree.s
1 of London would run ankle deep with Ihe bipod
<f. of his majesty and his party. He frequently ex
prefled himfelf in those terms before 'many others.
The witnefes particultrly 'ecolletted he did
so in the presence of Captain Gallery and Captain
; Collins. '* -
n ' Mr. Winter said, on his cross examination, that
. r the prisoner was at that time in the habit ot driuk
â ing Itrong liquors.
h Samuel Benet said, that he was on bdard the
- t Elizabeth prison-ship with Crofsfield, at Brest.
r He at onf time heard the prisoner sing an impio
]. perfong, and ex daim, " Damnaiion 10 the king
n of England !" He confefled, that he was one of
those who attempted to blow a poisoned dart at his
0 majesty. The witAefs told him that no true En
glishman would sing such a song ; and the prisoner
0 threatened to him put in irons. Ciofafield
declared that Tom Payne's works were the belt in
. the world 5 and said, that if ever he arrived in
. England; he would attempt to Ink- away the
j king's life again. The witness met him again on
) lizard the Cartel, aid he was desired by Crofsfield
not to take any notice of what had paflei on board
, the Eli'/.abrih.
, Waltrr Colmsn, who apprehended Crofsfirld on
f board the CartH ship, said, that he had offered to
him ?nd t. e other man who were conducting him
to Bodmyn, a guinea each if they consented to let
t him effape. As for the driver, he decided, if
they gave him a pistol he would soon fettle liim.
) Elizabeth Upton, wife to Thomas Upror;, said
. ihat (h? had seen her husband foi the l ift time on
tht 22d of February lall, be'ween and nine
, o'llock in the mo-aing His hat was afterwards
j biought t6 her by a waterman. She never saw her'
j hufbind diu k in. her lite.; (he k > ,w Cr- fsfield,
and had fc;en him trequenjly ai her husband's house
. in company with Palmer ; she saw one of the in
, ftruments produced in court at her husband's (hop
, âit was brought there by Hill, but (he saw
the tube there.
, George Steers said, he attended a meeting of
| the Comfponi'ing Society, and saw Upton there
,â  with fomni ing in his hand, which appeared to be
like the tube then in court.
Thomas Puley corroborated ihe evidence giveij
. by Sie'ers, ar.d added, that Upton (lyiok his head
when he uaÂ» asked by him what the tube was de
[ flgned fo-*?
Mr. Mortimer, the gun smith, explained the ef
. feft of an air gun, and of a feathered at row, the
. drawing of whicfi had found in Upton's
house, as well as the brass tube. It may be im
proper to publilh all that was defl ribed on this A:b
. jrft. He said it was a most dangerous and fatal [
, weapon.
. Mi.Wird, a'bairiflet. had seen the delign, and
. shewed it 10 Mr. Mortimer,, in Upton's house.
The ju-y brought in a verdiit not guilty.

RICHARD PARKER.

I HAVE for a long time believed that,the pro.
I per cul'ivation of turnips would be of great utili
t ty to the faimers, as they are veiy imtriWpu?, and'
' an excellent food f:.r cattle, of tlnir being
1 an wb6lcÂ£Â»nie and pleafari, root for culinary use.
â  For a great number of years 1 attempted to taile
; them in the common mode, but without fuectfs ;
â  to sow them in the brhad call and hoe theoi'as is Â»1-
1 ways done in England, I liave tried, but the ig
-1 norance anf* carelessness of negroes, pioved that
â  could not he done to advantage, as no regularity
t could be expelled. At length, four years ago, 1
s thought ot a phn'<>f f .wing whi.h I was confident
1 wo uld prove fucccfsful. as jt did not depend on the
1 fkilfulsclc or attention of negroes, [eveiyccrmwum
, hue negroe, though ever so ignorant, being com
- peteut to the bulincfs.) I procured a lhaight piece
s of timber of two inches and an h.ilf square, fix fjet*-
two inches long, and had piils of right or ninetn
â  chcs lrTTgptbtW in it Ml [mim in iln Â»t) Ufanee â¢ To
this puce 'of timber containing seven pins, were
l fixed two ftaf s (not for an lunfc but a man to
- draw) and two h 11' Its. f jhui, after the land was
. pin in proper order, marked off a (haight line ; a
, per fun then ill tire (hafts going backwards and
l* keeping the pin at the end of the piece,. i:i the line,
, with another per lon at the handle to affilt in direc
e ting the inltniptient, fix lines were laid off, and by
â¢ continuing- the <vork in the Lme manner,-it was
: Toon gone thnnu h. 1 "afterwards eroded it at
t right angles and foVved the ground tjy dropping two
- or three feeds in each or. Is, which was quickly per
. formed by children as 'veil as grown persons, who
with a finall goard or cup ia one hand containing
1 the feed, with tlpe fiuger and thumb of the other
1 dropped the f eds in each cfofs, and with the three
- hind fingers flirted a litt'? diit over the feed : I his
i work is performed in a much shorter tirae than
j would be fuppi.fed. The hrR expetiment I made
e I was attentive to the time employed in laying off
. and sowing the ground (was half an acre) which
was !ay,ed off i:i fquates in two hours and an half,
e and sowed in three, by very awkward hards as may
f be fujipolcd, as 'twas their firlf assay. When the
s turnip-tops were the iize of a piflareen, all were
. drawn out except one, the ground was hoed or
t worked twice, and from-the half acre 1 measured
f 225 bulliels of turnips'"; the next year from the
fame quantity of ground 1 made 200 bulliels ;
- the third year from an acre 1 made 556 ; those
l three years were very unfavorable for turnips, and
i ro pcrfon or very few in the neighbourhood made
f any but myfelf. - The lalt year I sowed an acre
v and an naif, two thirds of whu.-h wt\s very mean,
e and made 900 bnfliels ; 500 bushels were made
, from half an acre : but this was a remarkable line
1 year for turnip*. The firtt and third years I sow

they have been perfectly found and sweet till the
middle of April ; nor do I recollect to have seen
one rotten turnip in the four years I have treated
them in this manner. The turnips, are gathered

1 believe tkere is no God but nature ; no religi
on but revolution (alias regeneration ;) no just go
vernment but anarchy ; anJ no civil liberty where
the guillotine is not erected.
I believe that Robespierre was the great apostle
of liberty, and that he would have emancipated the
whole world from the (hackles of laws, had not death
cut fhon his glorious career.
I believe Genet is a prodigy of wisdom, and that
his ipfedizit is better authority than Montesquieu,
Puffendotf, and Vattel, those muily, antiquated a- 1
rillocrats.
I believe that war is better than peace, confufi
on than order, terror than mildness, and the guil
lotine than all the courts of juttice extant, /
I believe that the United States of America
ought to be under the direction of my brothers in
France, and that George Wafl)ington, commonly
called President- Washington, is an impertinent jack
anapes for counteracting our r.oble design.
I believe ihe tetroiirts were a band of cor.fum
jnate statesmen, genuine patriots, grea't benefa&ors
aild virtuous rcprefentatives.
1 believe that no person who dissents from our fra
ternity, ought to be peinrtted tofpeak, write, or
-commiinicatc his f.-ntimenis.

serous, r.oble and dignified ; well worthy of the great \

will find the American foes j except the demo
crats, who, like the torics in the late revolution,
would, Spaniel like, kiss the tod. These, how.
ver, are not half so numerous now, as the lories
were in 1775, arid would be glad to secure their
persons and eft.ites by raÂ»>deft lilence.
The Americans have sense enopgh to fee the so!-
ly of Inking themselves with the politics of any fo
reign iati->n whatever. Their wiftt s have univer
sally teen in, favour of the French revolution, so
far as ts object yvjs to destroy tyranny arid reform
abuses. Bat in nothing do the Freoch make a grea
ter niftake than in supposing the Americans will
submit their government to French influence. They
will submit to no 'influence: but that of their own
clear national interest. If we must quairel, it will
b4 to defend our country ; no matter who the aflai
lant is, a monarch or a republic.

with this view, have borne the loss of much pro. j

; not becaufc jhey love or sear/those uations, but be
! caufc, to submit and to nsgociate are less evils than
an open rupture, and there is no o:her alternative.

IV The names of the Subscribers shall be prefixed.
Th following Chara&er of this work c<
is extracted from t : ie Monthly Review, p 311, 31a, for
March, 1793 tj
" Wehavenofmall degree of in announcing
the present work to our readers ; as one wh ch from the
freedom of itsenquiry, the grandeur of its views, and the
fortitude of its principle, is eminently defe.rving of atten
tion. By this eulogium, we would by 1.0 means be undtr
flood to fubferibe to all the principles which these volumes
contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of T
certainty which is requisite, for any two men to think a- 1
like oh ail Fubjefts ; neither has language attained that con
fident accuracy, which can enable "them to convey their w
thoughts, even v hen they do think alike, in a manner per- ur
correct and intelligible to both. These difficulties
are only to be overcome by a patient, inceflant, and bene
volent invefligatiwn.
" Many of the opinions which this work contains, are
bold ; some of them are novel; andfomedoubtlefsare er
roneous :âb<ut that which ought to endear it even to those
1 whose principles it may offend, is the strength of argu
| ment adduced in it to prove, that peace and order most ef
j feftually promote the happiness after which political re
formers are panting ; âthat as the prqgreft of knowledge
is gradual, political reform ought nÂ«t to be precipitate ; â
and that convulsive violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that r fult comparatively would be of small
account) but to the genera! cause of truth. It is the op-,
pofiteof this principle that inspires the enemiasof politic
al enquiry with so much terror : it is the supposition that
change mufl inevitably be attended by the turbulence and
injuflice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be
made without the interv n ion of eVils more deftruCtivc
than those which are intended to be reformed. Under the
conviÂ«stion of this philanthropic fentimcnt, of calm and
gradual reform (which in its proper place he has fully il
lustrated) Mr. Godwin proceeds without scruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through itseflential branches, and
next to demonstrate future good.
" dividing his Work into eight books, and making THE
IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS the fubjeA of
the firft, he begins by an attempt to prove th? omnipo- y
tence of government over the moral habits of mankind ;
and that on these moral habits their wisdom, virtue and
felicity depend."
