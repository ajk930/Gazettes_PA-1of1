The purchsfersof lotiin Blula have the following
profpe&s'tif appreciating lh-_u property :
X. It is remote :rom aojr other tow.ii, and fur
rcunded by great "bodies of excellent land, capable
df producing; every kind of graixi and vegetables,
and is without doubt one tit the"belt graeuig Â«r;ur>-
tries is the United States.
1. In point of health the Ctoation is not exceed
ed by any on the continent.
3. Betides numerous If tings and runs, of the fin
ed quality, there is a creek fftr wltelf works (on
which mills are now building) running through the
town,
4. The public road from PtUadtlpbU to P'otf
burgh will go through it, which more level
and nearerthan any other rout, mull become uni
versally travelled : aided by the navigation of Ju-'
mata and Conemaugh, goods may be conveyed at
least a or 3 dollars per cwt. cheaper from the lor-'
mer to the latter place, than by the old road thro'
Bedford.
5. Being in the centre of a fUurilhing settle
ment, and taking in the fhortelt portage between
the eastern and western waters, it is likely to be
come a depolit lor floreÂ», a mami*aeinring town,
and a feat of jjiftice. Besides the old settlers, up
wards of oils hundred emigrants have fettled in the
vicinity of Beula, since last Oitober, and many
more have engaged to jofn them this summer.
6. A Land-Office for lupplying ailual fettiers
with farpis to a considerable amoni t, and in vari
ous situations, will be immediately opened in the
town. The proprietors of land in the circumja
cent country are fslicited to fend theio drafts and
terms of file, or leafing, to Thomas Jonss, Sur
veyor, iu Beula, who will give leeurity for any
tiuft repefed in him: with fudh co-operating ai l,
the pjoerefsof the fettlementwi 1 be the more ra
pidly advanced and extended to distant townlhips.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, July 7. '
THE modest Mr. Bacile, in bis paper of
this Morning, has, -with his ufudl regard to De
cncy and Truth, endeavored to impress a be-
Tie/ that the deiefed Jacobin, PLOUNT, of
the " virtuous" minority in the Senate, is one
of the " British fcaion" j as this RctuUer of
Sedition denominates the friends of their coun
try in the admimflration of the Government.
Blount was, indeed, " one of .the late
Pre/ident's officers" ; and like ALL who mere
feleÃed from the party to which he ever belong
ed, he has given evidence thai those who op
pafi the free government of their country, and
its atlmin'flraiion, are uncheckedLy Moral con
fideratioHS. Tr> oppose, thwart, misrepresent,
and defame a government, refling on Confidence
\ alone, thereby to dejlroy this confidence, has
been a. game as.of ten repeated as free govern
ments ha ve been deflroyed. The late President,
fiduced ly hie own consciousness of integrity,
and mijed by the hypocritical pretensions of'the
Antifederalifls, to superior attachment to liber
ty, the Conjlant tant of diforganizers, appoiv,'-
ed to 9 many of them to offices of importance.
And whr.( have been the returns ? While he
continued in office, they confiantly endeavored to
â 'excite opposition, ty mifreprifentation andfalfe
hood;âtheir malignity has folk-wed that
father cf his country to his hallowed retire
ment. And this friend of General Washing
ton, as the honest Bache wijhes he should be
believed, endeavors, bycajling " all the blame
on the late President", to give himfelf conse
quence, ly " exciting ike savages againfl our
country. 0 shame I'when wilt thou rejlrain
the votaries of feditioei ?
This infamous tranfaaion is, at present veil
ed, iV fame degree, with myflery When the
whole of the Prrfident'f communications /hall be
published, it will be obvious, that the objects of
the traiterous combination were not confined to
the application to the British Mvificr, but that
that application ttfelf was dfigned to produce
ej?Bs which should defeat the execution of our
treaty with Spain, and it has. fa far, at leafl
for the present, succeeded. The probability is,
that the principal agent, Blount, -was an in
s rumen.' in the hands of wily Frenchmen.
That it was hoped the bait would succeed as it
refpecled Great-Britain, and thereby involve
us in hof.ility with that country ; and for this
it is probable they relied upon our prejudices a
gairflthat nationâAt any rate, it was believ
ed, that it could not fail to excite fear and jea
lousy in the Span 'tfh government, and probably
might facilitate the cession of territory to France,
of which we have heard so much, and which
we know is so ardently desired.
Refpeaing Mr. Blount, it is a faÃ well
known, that he has invariably attached himfelf
to the oppofers of the admimflrationâthat on
no national quejlion has he ever voted with its
friends âthat his personal associations have ev
er been consonant with his votesâthat during
the laH winter his house was the rendezvons of
those who were canvassing for the eleÃion of
the Correfponaent of Mazzei to the Preftdency
âthat there has been a corfiant and open inti
macy between him and the French and Spanish
agents here ; and it is believed that he is not e
â Â«en personal ly known to the British Minifies,
but that all bis applications to him were made
by other men andin other names. '
Juflice demands that it should be added,
that Mr. Liflon gave no encouragement to the
proposals, but repressed the firfl advances ; and
that in his official communications, the reasons \
which influenced him in declining, produced a
rejection of the proje3 by the Britijh admiuif
tration.

Mr. Gallatin moved the order of the
day on the bill making additional appropri
ations for the year j 797.
The houfc accordingly went into a com
mittee of the whole on this fubjeft, and the
blanks of the bill were filled.
The firft five items were agreed to with
out objeftlon. On Mr. W. Smith's pro
poling to fill the 6th item with 60,000
dollars,
Mr. Nicholas, called for the reading
of the particulars which composed this sum.
They confilted of the falai-y and outfits of
Ministers to France ; to Prulfia, and to
the Barbary powers. Mr. N, wilhed the
sum mentioned to be forthe tyfinifter of Ber
lin, viz. 13,500 dollars to be deducted from
the 60,5 ro, as he knew of no pollible use
that a Minister to Berlin could be of. He
thought the present extension of foreign in
tercourse was far too great ; he wished
much to fecit narrowed, andtrultcd it would
be done at the ne*t feflion, as the law on
that fubjeft would then expire. He "wish
ed, therefore, to reduce this sum, in order
to to fliew their wish to have the business of
foreign intercourse circumscribed. He mo
ved to fill th>; blank with 47,000 dollars.
Mr. Harper thought it was too late for
the gentleman to talk in this manner, bc
caufe a sum of money . had uniformly beeu
appropriated for the purpose of foreign in
tercourse. It. was extraordinary, therefore,
that at this day, if there were no good reasons
for it, that lhey (hould now be called upon
to depart from their usual praftice. He
hoped it would not meet with the approba
tion of the house.
Mr. M'DoweLl was opposed to voting
any considerable sum for this purpose. It
might have been proper heretofore : but he
could fee rio reason at present for entering
into treaties with nations with whom we
neither had, nor could have any considera
ble connection. He wished to pAuse before
they agreed to this measure ; because, if a
greed to, he expected it would hereafter be
produced as a reason why they should extend
the business Hill farther.
Mr. Nicholas said, the gentleman from
S. Carolina seemed' to have miltaken him.
He did not propose to ftr/ke out any thing
which had heretofore been agreed to, but
whpt related to a further extension of our
foreign intercourse. Of the four northern
powers, he thought it was least necelTary to
have any connection with Prufiia j Ihe Was
in a situation to favor us less than any other
power. If a new treaty were entered into
with Pruflia, he supposed it would be next
proposed to have one with Sweden, Den
mark and Rufiia, as we had a much greater
commercial connÂ«Â£tion witb those powers
than with Prulfia. As to their having once
agreed to go into this business of foreign in
tercourse, it was no reason for continuing
it after they were convinced the fylletn was
injurious to the welfare andhappinefs of this
country.
Mr. W. Smith said, this motion invol
ved in it a very delicate conlideration. They
were called upon to vote for a less sum thai!
that estimated, upon the ground that
President had done wrong in fending a min
ister to Berlin. His colleague was right,
when he said this was running counter to ef
tablilhecLrule. He thought it would be con
trary to the spirit of the constitution, be
cause the power of judging of the propriety
of fending mi Mitel's to foreign 'countries rest
ed with the'Prefident and Senate ; but this
house conceiving they had made an injudi
cious exercise of that right, fay they will
withhold the necessary appropriations ;
which, he said, would be fxercifing a pow
er over th.t branch of government in which
the constitution had alone placed the power
of doing the
that the President having sent a minister to
Berlin, they were as much bound to appro
priate money to pay the expense, as they
were bound to provide for the salary of the
President, or of the judges. Some gentle
men, however, thought, that fueh a litua
ticn might exilt, rt> would juft'fy the with
holding of epprojniiftons. Admitting that
there might be fueh a situation, a question
would arise whether it should be done by
withholding an, appropriation, by impeach
ment, or by a vote of eenfure on the Presi
dent. For if that House were to arrest an
appropriation, be supposed the Senate would
not fuffer the bill to pass without it, and un
lesS they came into the opinion of the Sen
ate, no bill could pass.
He found Ir.mfelf embarrassed in discus
sing this question, bccaufe it was not their
province to adduce reasons for fending a min
ister to any particular place ; but he thought
if it were desirable we lliould have a minis
ter at any foreign court, it was that of Prus
sia ; and from the connexion which fublift
ed between that monarch and the French
republic, he should have supposed that those
gentlemen who wilhed so much to harmo
nize with the French Republic, would not
have objedted to the fending of a minister
there.
The treaty we formerly had with Pruflia
was expired, and he believed that court had
requeued a renewal of it ; the President had
also recommended it in his speech at the
opening of the feflion ; and there might exist j
reasons for it which were not proper
laid before that house. He agreed frivA pri
ma facia there appeared to be a jjifeter pro
priety for us to enter into tre; / with Den
mark, Sweden and Ruflia than with Pruflia.
We had a treaty with Sweden about to ex
pire ; and it was riot improbable that the
gentleman fer,t to Berlin, might also be em
ployed in making a treaty with Sweden. If
gentlemen had intended to make the present
ferions opposition to the measure, he thought
it would have been more candid to have
given notice of the intention, that gen
tlemen might have been prepared to meet it.
Mr. Gallatin said, it was rather An
gular that the chairman of the committee of
ways and means should be unprepared to
meet any opposition to this measure, since
he knew that several members of that com
mittee were opposed to it, and he mult there
fore have expedted that they would have
moved to appropriate a less sum. But it
appeared as if the gentleman wilted to make
a very serious question of what he considered
as merely incidental, viz. whether they
should vote so much money, or a less sum.
He believed he should shew it was of little
importance.
I In relation to the constitution, it was
merely said that the Prefi dent should have
\ ppwer to appoint ministers, ambafiadors, &c.
but, by the power to appoint ministers,
could never be meant that he had the power
to fend ministers to all the courts of Eu
rope, and to all the principalities of Germa
ny, and call upon that house only in an indi
rect way to agree to the appropriation. As
to the'power of appointing ministers, it was
a new power gfiven to the Executive by the
present constitution. The firft Congress
took up the fubjeCt. They might have said
there should be four or fix ministers employ
ed. They did not do this ; but they de
clared that the salary of a minister lliould not
f :ceed 2,000 dollars, nor his out fit a similar
f n, nor the whole 1 annual expense 40,000
dollars. By this check they divided the
power with the Executive ; and if this pow
er were not ailed upon, it would have been
absurd to have given it to them. He did
not look upon the present question as by any
means a constitutional one. The President
had appointed a minister for Berlin, for rea
sons best known to himfelf; and the question
betwixt them was, whether the appointment
was a proper one.
They had been yearly called upon for
additional appropriations for this object :
if they thought it necelTary to check this
fnirit for foreign connections, or were de
termined not to renew the law relative to
foreign negociations, it would be right to
agree to the proposed reduction. As to
impeachment, or eenfure, they were out of
the question. The President thought a mi
nister to the court in question would be of
some use ; they thought differently, and that
the money would be more valuable. Where
was the cause of acufation ? It was merely
a difference of opinion.
Another collateral argument of the gen
tleirtan from S. Carolina, related to what the
Senate would do. He did not think it par
liamentary to fay the Senate would do this
or that.
1 - To enforce the propriety of fending a
minister to Berlin, the gentleman from S.
Carolina had suggested two reasons, viz. the
'of the President, and the
of renewing our treaty. He did
not think a renewal of that treaty would be
of any advantage to us ; nor did he think
any gentleman was anxious about it. By
that treaty the United States were prohibit
ed from fitting out privateers in any cafe.
But he thought that gentleman had used a
strong argument againji fending a minister
to Berlin. He did not know how far the
the gentleman was well informed ; bi)t if the
object of the minister was to prevail upon
the king of Pruflia to obtain an accommo
dation for us' with France, he thought it
would be the worst policy which could be
adopted. Such an offer of mediation would
not be likely to produce an accommoda
tion. [Mr. S. said he had mentioned this
merely as a suggestion of his own, without
any authority.}
Another consideration, Mr. G. laid, in
duced him to be in favor of reducing the ap
priation was, that the money was altogether,
unnecessary. He did not suppose the gen
tleman from S. Carolina vvilhed to appro
priate for ministers/ which had no existence,
and the money now asked had been appro
priated already in full. It was true it was
appropriated for a minister to be sent to Por
tugal ; but none had been sent there, so that
the money remained unexpended, and the
fame gentlemen intended for the former em
bassy, was now employed on this. The fact
was that their appropriations for foreign in
tercourse were not particularized, but made
in gross. There was. therefore, a fufficient
sum of money in hand, iince the oEjeci ha 3
merely been changed.
Mr. J. Williams argued in favor cf tits
larger fuhi, as it had been' usual to- appro-'
prial< money to pay the expense of any mi- 1
nitter Vvhi'ch the Prefiden - . (accordingto the '
power placed in him by the conft't-utioii)
though? it neteifary to fend abroad. He
thought it might He attended with bad'ccn
ftquences to withold the appro- -
priations for this [purpose, especially when
a miniiler had already been appointed.
Mr N. Smith iai 1 tTi*i>
had agitajed i\c house ever since the gentleman
fiom Pennfyl,vania came into five government ;
as it had been ins eonjtant endeavour to swallow
up the executive power in that lioufe- For cer
tainly, if that hoUse had the powir to approp-i
---ate'or r.ot to appropriate, to deflroy, or support
the appointment of a miniiler, at their pleal'ure,
it was terta'|i that the executive was r-o longer
an independent branch of government. Mr. S.
'said, as he wilhed to preftrve the government
pure, he should always bear teitimonv ag.inft
such a doQrine. He considered the executive
as the sole judge as to the propriety of appoint
ing fc tien ministers ; and being sole judge, that
houfc had no rtgh-t to judge over his head, any
mote tljan over the head of the judiciary ; and
w>. *-?ver any one branch of government fhalJ
ptciume to judge over the head of another,
'liore was an end to 1 lie' puritv of ouf' system.
, Mr. Baldwin spoke < f the ground upon
which this business was originally fettled. He
laid '.hey determined not to lay to the President
to what place a miniftej should be fern, or what
quality of miniiler fhou.ci be appointed; but t}iey
stipulated the quantity of money to be expended.
At the tim* the furn was firft enlarged, a parti
cular urgency ex'ift: d. He looked upon the ex
tension of this power as unfortunate for this
country, and he IhouM be against its going far
ther. The gentlemap from Conuedticut had
therefore difturbedhiralelfunneceffarily, when he
thought this doilrine was of recent date ; it waa
certainly as old as the government.
Mr. Thatcher. thought'the gentleman last
up was mistaken. He did tiot believe that bv
confiniug the expenditure in'rdpefl 1o fpfeigu
neget iations to 40,000 dollars,- it was. meant to
irammel the powers of the President; but that
the ftm was granted because it was thought it
would be fuflkiem for.tlÂ»e purpose. He had no
idea that they had a light to 1 the Presi
dent in this refpeift.
Mr. SeWAll ct nfidered this qurtiion of so
much important* that heccpld not refrain from
delivering his opinion upch it. He mGftÂ«d upon
the conllitutien being char in placing the pow
er in the executive, and that the appointment of
miniftera liood upon the fame ground as the ap
pointment of the judges of the federal Â»ourt.
The question, he said, l'eemed to c6nie to this:
Whether the Prelkeflt Ihould obtain an appro
priation from that lioufe, before he proceeded.to
appoint a irinilter A dosrir.e cf th; 3 kind
would beextrem ly inconvenient, finite Congress
Were only in feffi&n at certain period., whereas
it could not be said at what precift time it should
be neceflary 10 fend a miniiitr to a foreign coun
try. If the President should be guilty of exces
sive ill conduiH, gentlemen would do well to
come forward and fay he had done wrong ; but
even in that cafe, he should be doubtful whether
that house would be juftified in refefing an ap
propriation ; as it would be neeeflary to punish
the Prefioeot in a different way .â¢ for in refufijig
the neccifary money, the perfon 1 employed on
the embalf) would be punilhed, and not the Pre
sident.
Mr. Gallatin wilhed the gentleman from
Connefl'u ut instead of being angry, had attend
ed to the fa<ft wtlich he bad itatid, viz, that,the
money asked for was already appropriated, tie
wiflicd alio that lie had. enquired into the fa&
whether at any time they had appropriated for
the'expence 01 niiniflers before they existed. If
they were found to appropriate, thtv wure not
bound to appropriate what was before
them. He did not believe that even rhe.gentle
man from Coanelticut would fubferibe to this
doctrine.
As to what the gentlemen had said rela
tive to what had takenplacclirtCe he came
into that houfe,-he ws? altogether.
In addition to what- had becij said to the
gentleman from Georgia, .he would afkwhy
the law of 1750 was limitted for two years,,
if r.ot meant to check the,power of the Pre
sident ? If Congress had beep of opinion that
they were bound, they would have made a
permament appropriation as in relation to the
public debt.
If, because they differed in opinion, they
were to charge each other with subverting
the government, there would be an end to
business. He gave the C6nftitution a con
ftru&ion whifch he thought right; that
gentlemen, he supposed, dicl the fame, and
though in his opinion, his doftrine brought
all legislative power into the hands of the Ex
cutive, yet he would not charge him with a
ny other than good intentions.
With refpeft to the judges of the Su
pre le Courts the President had the power
only to appoint them, their number was
fixed by the legislature ; so that there was
afimilar check in both cases. He thought
the true ground was the'expediency of the
business. â¢
Mr. Harper asked whether that house
was pofiefied of all the information necefia
ryto form a judgment of the propriety of
this measure. Gould they fay with pro
priety, that a minister ovght riot to be sent
either to Lisbon or Berlin ? And if t;he pro
posed sum were taken from the appropria
tion, one ofthefe millions must be given up.
Thus to controul the power of the prefidest,
in his opinion, would be to destroy a provi
iion of the confutation, and bring the presi
dent into a very humiliating fituijtiori.
Mr. Nicholas said, if the appropriation
of money was not veiled in their hands for
the purpose of exercising their judgment up
on the propriety of expence, he could not
fee the use it was of; but he did believe they
had the power of controlling what appeared
to them improper expence, and.that it wis
their duty to do so.
The queftlon was put for filling the blank
with the larger sum, viz, 60,5.00 dollar-.,
and carried, there being 50 votes in favour
of it.-
The 7th, Bth, 9th, 10th, nth, and
12 th, items were agreed without opposi
tion.
On the y,coo dollars proposed for the
hofpiyl department, some debate took
place. It was urged by Meflrs. W. Smith,
and Otis, on the ground of its having been
called for by the proper department, and
that if it was not expended, the money
would be fafe in the treafliry.
lt was opposed by MefT.s* Gallatin, Vat".
o'Jlh and Macon, as in-their opinion unr.ecefTaÂ»

were made general, and a furplos under one

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, Juir 7.
William Blount took his feat in the
Senate yesterday, as usual. He read a short
address, in which he said he trufled when he
came to be heard upon his trial, he should
be at>le to clear himfijlf from the charges
which he understood were to be brought a
gainst him. We understand he was allow
ed to be heard by council this day, to
lhew why he ought not to be expelled from
his feat in the house.
Thereportofthe Committee of the House
of Representatives on Mr. Blount's business
was debated yesterday. It concluded with
an opinion that he ought to be impeached of
high crimes, and misdemeanors. The sub
ject was adjourned to this day. 1
This forenoon, the House of Represent
atives adopted the Report of their Com
mittee, nrm. con. relative to Mr. Blount,
âm conlequence of which, the House, in
a body, carried up to the Senate, an Im
peachment against him, of High Crimes and
Mifdemcanours.
In Senate of the United States,
July 6, 1797.
The committee to whom was referred that
part of the President's message which relates
to a letter purporting to have been written
by Willam Blount, one of the
Senators from the State of Tennessee, to
gether with the papers accompanying the
fame, having had the fame under their con
federation, beg leave to make a farther re
port.
That Mr. Blount having declined an ac
knowledgement or denial of the letter impu
ted to him ; and having failed to appear or
give any fatisfaitory explanation refpeiling
it, your committee sent for the original let
ter whifh accompanies this report, and is in
the following words..
( See yesterday's Gazette.)
Two Senators now present in the Senate,
have declared to the committee that they are
well acquainted with the hand writing of
Mr. Blount, and have no doubt that this
letter was written by him, your committee
have examined many letters from Mr. Blount
to the Secretary of War, a number of which
are herewith submitted as well as the let
ter addressed by Ms. Blount to Mr. Cocke
his colleague in the Senate, and to this com
mittee refpefting the business now under
confederation ; and find them all to be of
the fame hand writing with the letter in
question. Mr. Blount has never denied
this letter, iSit on the other hand, when the
copy transmitted to the Senate was read in
his presence on the 3d inft. he acknowled
ged in his place that he had written a letter
to Carey of which he had preserved a copy,
but could not then decide whether the copy
read was a true one. Your committee are
fully persuaded that the original
letter now produced was written and sent to
Carey by Mr. Blount. They also find that
this man, Carey, to whom it was-addreffed,
is, to the knowledge of Mr. Blount, in the
rpay and employment of the United States,
as their interpreter to the Cherokee Nation
of Indians and an assistant in the public Fac
tory at Tellico Blockhouse. That Haw
kins who is so often mentioned in this letter
as a person who mull be brought into suspi
cion among the Creeks and if possible dri
ven from his station, is the Superintendant
of Indian affairs for the United States among
the Southern IndiansâDinfmore Â»is agent
for the United States in theCherokee nation,
and Byets, one. of the agents in the public
Factory at Tellico Blockhouse.
The plan hinted at in this extraordinary
letter to be executed under the auspices of
tie British, is so capable of different con
ftruilions and conjectures that your commit
tee at present forbear givingany decided
ion refpeiting it; except that taMr. Blount's
own mind it appeared to be inconsistent with
I
| the interests of the United States and of
j Spain, and he wis therefore anxious to con
ceal it from both. Bat when they consider
ed his to seduce Carey from his du
ty as a faithful interpreter and to employ
him as an Â»-ngine to alienate the affeitioas
and confidence of the Indians frotA the pub
lic officers of the United States residing
among them ; the measures he has proposed
to excite a temper which mull produce the
recall or expulsion of our fuperintendant
from the Creek, nation, his insidious advice
tending to the advancement of his own po
pularity and consequence at the expense and
hazard of the good opinion which the Indi
ans entertain of this government and of the
treaties fubfiftihg between us and them ;
your committee have no doubt that Mr.
Blount's conduit has been inconsistent with
his public duty, renders him unworthy of a
further continuance of his present public trull
in this body, and amounts to a high misde
meanor. They therefore unanimously re
commend to the Senate an adoption of the
following resolution.
Resolved, That William Blount, Esquire,
one of the Senators of the United States
having been guilty of a high misdemeanor
intirely inconsistent with his public trust and
duty as a Senetor, be, and he hereby is ex
pelled from the Senate of the United States.

Extrracl of a letter from the Secretary of
War to Brigadier General James Wilkin
fon, dated War-Office, 9th June, 1797.
" YESTERDAY the Secretary of State
received letters from Mr. Ellicott, by which |
it would appear that scruples on the part of
Governor Gayofo had retarded the evacua
tion of the polls.
" These scruples or objections are, firft,
That in his opinion the forts ought to be
demolilhed ; 2d. That he thought it neceflfa
ry to continue his force in that quarter till
the claims of Spanilh fubjeÂ£ls to land should
be adjulled by negociation.
" As to the firft, our officer may be in
ftruited to agree to the demolition of the
works if infilled on. As to the second, he
will affurethe governor that he is authorized
to fay, that no person shall be disturbed in
his possession or property till an opportunity
has been afforded to apply to Congress, and
that they may rely upon their claims being
adjusted upon.the moll equitable principles.
" It is to be presumed, that on receiving
these explanations, the SparJfh garrisons
will be withdrawn. If, however, contrary
to expedlation, this ftiould not happen our
officer is to take a secure position, but not so
near them as to give any cause to the Spanilh
garrisons to apprehend insult or injury."â
