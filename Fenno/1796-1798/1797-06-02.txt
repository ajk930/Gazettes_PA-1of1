If any other authenticity were requijite for ta |r,
the judicious and well exprrffed feniiments of } lu (
the writer, 'we "would add that we are ac- ]
painted with the parties between whom the
communication has pajfed, dul
" You are well aware, I presume, that ; ro(
the fituatioh of our country with refpedl to j u .
France, has lately become extremely criti- by
cal ; that the proceedings of the executive ,h t
government of the latter have assumed a p ri
complexion of animosity and violence which bui
threaten at least an interruption of the good at
intelligence and harmony that had so long an ,
| subsisted between our refpe&ive nations. R |
I Perhaps an important crisis is not diftar.t,
which it may be painful to anticipate, but att
which when it ripens to a head will require te;
no common boldness to be contemplated r |f,
with composure. The system of terror is
employed against our government with as
little ceremony as it was once employed by a
Britilh ministry against our nation, and is je<f
â unqualified. And if the consequences they r0 i
may expedt ihould not result from it, ,coer
cive measures may soon be expedtcd to sol- j 1
low. What these will produce, time must ga
unfold. In my last letter you were given to a | ;
understand that, our new minister lent re- G f
place Mr Monroe,, at Paris, had not been re- qt
ceived by the executive diredtory ; and that w
Mr. Monroe had received, upon the occa. te
fion of taking his leave, particular marks of
favor which were personal to himfelf, and at
expressly separated him from the injurious 0 |
exprefiions used towards the government he
had been sent to represent. Since then, Mr.
Pinckney has been ordered to quit France.
It can hardly be supposed that the system,
which gave rile to these measures will stop p
Ihort in its operation at this point : We f
. must therefore be prepared to face other in- w
, fults, more indignities, and a greater por- 0
> tion of wrongs than we have yet fuffered 0
â  from the French Republic. They are raif- 1 ;
" ing pretensions to dominion over us which
are utterly incompatible with our indepen- v
s dence ; such as, I trust, no patrioticAAme n
- rican will be content to promote, and which b
J few, I beligve, will fee with indifference, r
' A French yoke, or a British, will never fit
t lightly upon my neck, and I think I am
c not lingular in the delicacy of my feelings,
o lam pot ignorant, however, that there are |
T those my country, ready, willing, and al- , f
ready engaged to become Arnolds and K.an- : ;
dolphs in the French cause, who have en- {
â¢- lifted under the banner, and expedt to be t
it covered with the (hield of those immaculate i
ia principles which, we have been told, are so (
II peculiar to that republic.
[I You may wilh to know how far the peo- :
3t pie of France coincide with the views of i
n their present government, in their treatment, ;
Â» f towards the United States ; and whether a
war at this time between the two nations,
* would be odious or popular. I have every
id reason to believe that the French nation de
i- precate lincerely such an extremity ; that it
a- ig the general wilh to maintain a friendly in
a" tercourfe witli us, because they know it to
be reprocally beneficial, and neither feel nor
f e fee any reason for its suspension. But, in
id order to account for the exiltence of such
id opposite dispositions in their present rulers,
at for the little influence the public voiceappears
to possess in the executive councils, it is ne
n. celfary to know that the government in this
er country is every thing, and the people noth
ot The sovereign majesty of the people is just
* ; e fufficient to be held in i'upreme contempt ;
and whether they are for, or against, the
condudl of the diredtory, on any given oc
casion, it is scarcely worth while to enquire.
The directory alone cannot declare war, and
I am almost persuaded that the legislative bo-
dies are far from desiring war with America ;
but the executive may be profoundly hostile
towards us, and diredt violences and provo
cations against our country, which must
_ lead to open resentment, and the legislative
' bodies cannot prevent them. Should such
condudt therefore be pursued, and the accu
mulated injuries of the French directory
compel the government of the United States
to refill by an appeal to arms, the French
nation will be made the blirid.and deluded in
strument of vengeance against their only
real and sincere friends. It is painful to an
American to contemplate this pidture ; for
who among us has not wilhed well to their
cause, so long as it was a contest for freedom
and independence ?
You need not be told that America is not
the only neutral government, wherein French
intrigue is active ; menaces equally bold are
,ck- addrclfed to all the neutral commercial states,
ng- but with as little success in general as with
â . ds ' us. Enmity to their only formidable foe,
â an anxious desire to cut off her commerce
f ew with all her nations, and despair at the dif
trefiing situation of her own affairs, has pro
old. probably been the inducement with the di
> redtory to adopt their present policy, lime
and experience must either convince them of
its temerity, or by fuccSts they will derive
a fandtion for it."

LONDON, April 8, to 11. Gor
Privaee accountsreceivedfromViennahave
brought the difagrccable news of a general 2 4 1 '
ailion having taken place between the two m yÂ»
grand armies in the Tyrol, in which the a ' oa
Austrian army was defeated with very con- xen
fiderable loss ; and the Archduke for a fliort *Â°> c
time taken prisoner, some of the enemy's j P r ''
troops having seized his horse's bridle ; but !
; his Royal Highness was very soon rescued j
by some of his soldiers. He is reported to omt
â  be wounded- '
Â» The following additional particulars are g lv(
â¢ given also : that Buonaparte apprised of the hed
â  march of a numerous body of troops to re- F r:
inforce the army of Prince Charles, made too
an attack upon his Royal Highness, -which, kill
after an obstinate and desperate ccnflift was Â°hl
. attended with complete fuecefs. The re- F r ' :
- fult of this unfortunate affair was that the l' ai
Archduke, thus cut off from his reinforce- Au
ments immediately retreated into the circle f<iu
- of Austria, leaving the French general to Ar
-1 take quiet poffeflion of ofthe important polls
s ; of Villecli, inCarinthia, about 60 leagues
rr , f rom Vienna. In the above aftion eleven cor
i- officers belonging to one Austrian regiment Fn
I are said to have been killed ; and the arch- an
1- duke, as before stated, in his endeavours to Tj
retrieve the fate of the day, narrowly efca- thÂ«
f-| ped, in a wounded condition, from falling Sa
e into the hands of the enemy. The heroic |
e behaviour of his Royal Highness upon this Fr
rS occasion, is spoken of in terms of the highest tra
ir admiration. On' the intelligence of this rcj
io reaching Vienna, that city was thrown trc
into the utmost consternation, and, in the 1,11
moment of alarm, many of the inhabitants an
proceeded to pack up their property, for
' the purpose of removing it to a place of
; greater security. ls '
ld Such are the general outlines of the pri- o"
ife vate advices received upon this fubjeft.â
The official dispatches received by govern- cÂ«Â£
ment on Thurday, it is however neceifary to he
e ; observe, make no mention whatever of any of
\ n general engagement having taken place.â au
They, however make mention, that the im- let
perialifts had been defeated in a partial ac
tion, with the loss of one general and 1800 th
men taken prisoners ; and adds, that there eh
li_ had been several affairs of polls, in which the w
French were generally victorious. The fe<
archduke, it is allowed on all hands, has re- fp
â¢ treated into Carinthia, but whether in con
ro, sequence of the defeat stated to have been th
:es sustained by him, or for the purpose of con- fit
:m centrating his force for the defence of Auf- L
; an tria, is difficult to mention.
lth In the account lately given of the secret m
ar . articles of the treaty signed at Basle, and ra- so
he tified by a new Convention on the 6th of it
be- August last, at Berlin, between Prussia and ti
vi- France, it was stated that his Prussian Ma- a
jefty had made certain flipulations fbt him- a.
rcd felf, the Stadtholder, and the Prince of d
Hesse. The following was the project. Â«
,j er of Prussia to have the fertile
I provinces of Munfter, which lies contiguous v

a " f 1 that let the war terminate as it may, the J
a I King of Prussia as well as the French Di- 1

In answer to Mr. Fox's observations, Mr.
Pitt repeatedâÂ« That be could not fee how
far thepurpofe, which was evidently and equal
ly in the view of all parties, was to be accele
rated by the present motion. He had fully ex- (
plained, what the purpose of Mr. Hammond's j[
I mifpon to Vienna was, '' to adopt the means u nitc
mojl likely to bring about a pacification in con- No
cert with his majefly's ally." The object of fliare:
â  both parties was the fame, and the important
events which had lately taken place rendered it
more necejfary than ever that they Jhould ad tn j |
: concert. This flep was Jefolved upon as soon irtwJ
s as miniflers were informed of the magnanimous to pr
; resolution of the Emperor not to make a peace
1 I but in concert with Great-Britain. This had
t been contradicted, becavfe the fa 3 had not been , L-l
used in argument when the Emperor's loan was
; debated. It was omitted by him, but not un
- deftgnedly. He chose to leave the queflion on p
1 its own ground, after he had slated, in Q a p
il every pojfible view of the circumflances the Em-
J peror was entitled to our aid. The advices
e which hadJince been received were certainly of
an unfortunate tenor ; the real extent of the bu
h finefs was not, however, as yet known. He
e did not a3 upon those advices, though he Jhould
i, certainly combine them with his other views of J
e the proceeding."

(t - Cha
e Yeflerday at noon the gentlemen who had
offered to contrail for the ensuing loan waited _
n on Mr. Pitt, according to appointment, when
n he informed them that Jince he lafl saw them,
[e some circumflances had arisen which made it ne-
). ceffary for him, as the agent of the public, and
le injujlice to themfelves,to pojipone the settlement
of the loan for some days, until he saw what
l y was likely to be the turn of events now pend- ~D
ry ing. He told them that Mr. Hammond was m
be about to set out for Vienna immediately, and that RE
â  e , he should explain himfelf more particularly in <r.
the House of Commons ; to our report of the ibt
ve debate in which we refer our readers, for fur
he ther information on this interefling fubjeÃ. Jâ¢
a . Yeflerday, about half pafi one o'clock, Mr.
on Newland went to the Stock Exchange, and read
o f e a letter which Mr. Pitt had written to the <nt
,nt Bank Directors, acquainting him of his inten
nt tion to pojipone the loan. ; . . Zl
In consequence of this communication, m
\th the funds rose between 2 and 3 per cent; and f tr
he the last loan left off at a discount of only 8 of
th e j 1-4 per cent. _ ""
