HOUSE OF representatives.
rmÂ»AY, aphil Â»o.
Th? House having rtfohred itfelf into 1 committee
- ct the whole-fin the ftacrof the Union, on the
bill to (.rovide an additianal armament for the
< prote&ion of the trade of the United States, and
for other purpafes. when the consideration of
Mr. Gallatto's amendment to the firll feiSion
being refumtd, viz- to iafcrt 14 provided they
shall hot, in time of peace, Ije employed as con
royr to any port or place.'
(Continued from ye/lerftay I 's Gazette.J
IT being part three o'clock, a motion was
made for tfce committee to-rife.
This was opposed by MefTrs. Harper,
Brooks, Craik and Sewall, who were deter
mined to take the question before the com
mitree rose, if they fat till midnight; for* if it
we,Â«f i nhsrid upon again 011 Monday, they
laid they idppoied it would occupy another
week. !c was supported by MefTrs. Living
fton, Findley, Brent, M'Dowell and Macou.
They complained of being deprived of an op
portunity ofreplyingto what had been said,
and of being cosrfced into a decision on a
question upon which depended the peace of
the country ; that there would be 110 neceili
ty for adjourning till Monday ; the house
could meet to-morrow, and no time would be
1011. The question on the committee's rifug,
was put arwt negatived 47 to 39.
ft having been determined the committee
would not rife,
Mr. Macon proceeded to make some ob
servations. He did not think, that in cafe of
war, the loudest talkers here, would fee amongst
the firifto defend their country. He believed,
though others were less willing to plunge the
coun'iy in war, they would be found more
ready to defend it in cafe of danger. The ar
guments of the gentlemen from Connecticut
and MaTachufetts led direClly to war; for a
kind of fighting peace, Mr. M. said, our mea
sures would be too flrong, and for vtar too '
weak. If gentlemen were determined on war,
and would come to a declaration of it atooce,
he should know what to do.
Some very strange charges had been made
against gentlemen desirous of preserving the
peart of the country as long as possible, such
as being under the influence of the French
government, &c. but if thefecharges applied
to the members of this house, they would al
fe apply to those who sent them ; and could
so fti-.iiige an absurdity for a moment be coun
tenanced, as that half'he people of this coun
try flvsuld be thus influenced ? It could not.
Whatever a majority did, would doublefs be
abided by) but, in the mean time, it was
certainly proper that every man should ex
press his free and unbiafled opinion. These
charge! were hot made to have an influence
here, but out of doors, where he characters
of Uie persons charged were not known.
There was one part of the observations of
the gentleman from Connecticut which he did
not underfland, vis. by the information â¢ hich
he received f. â¢m his donftituenfs, be befeved
that this house would be compelled to aCt.-
Mr. M. said he was not afraid of any com
pulsion from that quarter. And why did
gentlemen talk of compelling Congress to
aCt? Was this proper ? If he were to r be
compelled to aC>, of what use was it for his
condiments to fend him there ? He would
afliire that gentleman he would not be com
pelled to aCt.
It was objected againftgfcntlemerwthat they
fpokeof waysand means. He considered mo
ney as the finfivvs of all our exertions. With
money we could do every thing ; we could,
' he knew, do a great deal without it ; but was
the country to be led blindfold into a war for
the protection of commerce ; without fpeak
ingof the expellee.
Gentlemen were continually talking of
French diplomatic agency. For his part, he
cared not for these charges. He never knew
fix Frenchmen in his life. Congress had no
proof of any such agency; but they had good
proof of tha'diplomatic agfney of another
country; and he wished they had a rule simi
lar to one which is eflablifhed in England,
that no member of Congress should visit a
foreign minister.
Certain gentlemen had been so long in the
habit of acting with large majorities, that
when the house was likely to be nearly di
vided upon a question, they became angry ;
but they could not suppose that the method
which they took ofabufing the agents of one
half the country, and consequently the peo
ple of that part of the country also whom
they reprefentcd, was the bed for producing
unanimity.
At one time, Mr. M. said, it was said that
the whole ot these vessels were wanted for the
pi'otertionof that partof the coast which is not
fortified ; at another for convoys. If they
were employed for the latter purpose, they
could not protect the coafl. Belides, he tho't
the idea of convoying the trade of the United
States, was a fanciful one, and could not be
carried into effect. He hoped, therefore,jhe
motion would be agreed to.
Mr. M'Dowell wished to make a few re
marks on what the gentleman from Connecti
cut had faid/efpeCting the conversation of X
and Y, as to the rfivifion of sentiment which
exitted in the United States, which went to
infiriuate that some members of this house
were improperly afted upon by French diplo
matic (kill. >
There could be no doubt how these agents
came in pofleflion of such opinions. Certain
gentlemen opposed to them in opinion, have
frequently proscribed one half the Union on
this floor, and it has been openly declared,
that only men of a certain political opinion
could expert to be employed by government.
As to diplomatic (kill, he believed no coun
try exceeded the Bfitjfh ir their knowledge
of this art ; that house had proofs of itS hav
ing been carried to a considerable extent in
th?s country. And it mufl be acknowleged
that Great-Britain has a much greater influ
ence in the sea-ports than the French, by rea
son of their extensive commerce.
The gentleman from Connecticut had spo
ken of American feelings ; and said that fo
reigners could not pofTefs tlie fame feelings In
favour of this country with them. There
were members of this hotÂ»fj. Mr. M|D. said,
who were Aot born here, who had given the
flrongeft proofs of thetf attachment to this
country, by having been engaged in that ser
vice which produced the Independence of
the country. [Mr. Dana explained, by fay
ing he made no allusion to him, as he kne*y
lie took an active part in the late revolution].
Mr. M'D. concluded, by faying, he had no
doubt gentlemen who were so loud in their
boaftmgs, would, when dangerappeared,coine
forward te defend their country ; but he be
lieved others, who differed In opinion from
them, would be as ready to do it as they. He
hoped, therefore, gentlemen would not take
the liberty-os representing others as disinclined
to support every measure which they think
necenary for the support of the country, so as
not only irritate members themselves,- but
the people whom they rcprefent.
Mr. T. Claiborne said, if ever there was
a time which.called tor harÂ«iony ip tranfafl
ing the bolinefsot the Union, it was at this,
time. â He lÂ»o"ped tl.e committee would rife.
To-morrow being Saturday, the house could
fit "on that day, and the day would be well
spent in>-a farther discussion of this question.
It was now (We o'clock.: he wished to rife.
Th? (jjneftionon rising, was put and nega
tived 44 to 33.
The committee having determined 10 fit,
Mr. Gallatin then rofeâlt wouldfeem,
he said, that a majority of this committets in
lifl upon taking th.' queltion before they rife.
He felt a reluctance at troubling them again
at this late hour; yet, after what had pailed
yesterday and to-day, it could hardly be sup
posed that he Ihould give his vote without
makingafew observations upon what had ta
ken place.'
He had been at a loss to know whether the
warmt>Â«dif{>Jiyed yesterday by some gentle
men by the amendment itfelf,
or by thcmaniter in which he had supported
jt. Theamendment was in substance the tame
which had been proposed theday beforeby.Mf.
Nicholas, the decision of which then been
evaded, but upon which no reflection of this
j kind had taken place. Nor could he, upon
! reflection, and ftilllefs from what had fallen
, from gentlemen in reply to his observations,
I find that there was any thing improper in the
manner in which he had supported his mo
tion.
It appeared to him, however, from the ge
neral turn of the debate, that the great object
of gentlemen was to compel by fear those who
differed from them in opinion, to vote as .(they
: pleated, or at leafl to oblige them to.give
; fileiit votes.
He was juftified in that alTertion by what
I had fallen from themselves to-day. They fay,
, that in reading the late difpatclies, they find
: that certain unauthorized agents of the French
' government, in inofficial cortverfations held
j with our Envoys, expressed an opinion that
! there was a Krench party in this country,,
who, if the negociation failed, would throw
the biame upon the Envoys. And, said Mr.
G. we are now told it is our duty to (hew thjt
we do not approve of these sentiments, in
other words, that we do not belong to that
French party. And how is this to be done f
By voting as these gentlemeÃ please, and by
agraeing to pveiy proposition, however ex
travagant, which they may chufe to bring
forward. .
Nay, one of the members from Connecticut
infilled that gentlemen ought not to reprobate
oroppdfeany measure ofgovernment. Mean
ing, he supposed, the Executive [Mr. Allen
explained by faying, that he had said, minori
ties ought always to acquiesce in the determi
nations of majorities]. How that member
meant to apply such an observation to the
present question before it was decided, he
could not tell. The remark which he alluded
to, fell from him in speaking upon what he
(Mr. G.) had said with respeCt to the publi
cation-os the late dispatches. And after a
vote had bÂ»en carried in this house by a majo
rity of more than three-fourths against the
publication, had he not a right to fay that his
hopes of peace were diminifhrd by this publi
cation ? But the member from Connecticut
had also in very general terms declared that
no men who were not devoted to France ought
in the pretent situation of things, to fay any
thing which might refleCt upon the conduCt
ofadminiflration. To those observations com
ing from that quarter he would perhaps have
paid no attention; but the gentleman from
Connecticut on his left (Mr. Dana) alfoftated.
that the opposition of members to the present
motion, would encourage Prance to pursue
her attacks and intuits upon us; thatfheknew
there were dlvffions in this country, and that
whether the people were the tools or dupes of
France made no difference. He went on to
Ihew that the speech of the gentleman from
Virginia was known there, and that therefore
he (Mr. G.) and others ought to be very
careful of what they said. He went farther,
and said, if he (Mt. D.) were in his (Mr.
G.'s) place, lie should nÂ®t have pofietred so
much patriotilm as to have offered any oppo
sition to the present measure, for fear, how
ever innÂ®cent his intentions might be, that
slander might attack his character; so that it
is only neceflary, according to the gentleman's
doctrine, to ipread slander, and the person
attacked mufl be compelled to acquiesce in
any measure that (hall be prppofed by gentle
men of different political opinions. Did that
gentleman really feel so sensibly the voice of
calumny as to fuffer it to prevent him from
doing what he conceives to behis duty, left he
thould be thought by the. world to be actuated
by improper motives ? He would not give
credit to such an assertion ; on the Contrary,
he mufl think that that gentleman, conscious
of his innocence and integrity, would if in his
place aCt precisely as he hiinfelf had done.
He woulddefpife the attacks of calumny, and
follow that line of duty which his own judg
ment told him was right and proper.
And, indeed, he could hardly underfland
how any member on that floor could suppose
that it was fufficient to fhedhis venom on the
character of another member in order to force
him to be silent. He could hardly have be
lieved that any member would have supposed
those gentlemen who, from principle were op
posed to certain mjafures, and him amongst
others, so deflitute of fortitude, as not to be
able to refill unfounded flanderand vague im
putations, so weak and unprincipled as to a
bandon his real opinion on account of sugges
tions of this kind.
â  The question before the committee was
whether the power of grantingconvoys should
be reflrained in time of peace.
The bill under consideration was brought
forward avowedly for the purpose of pro
tecting commerce. It was objected to the
present amendment that it went to the anni
hilation of commerce, merchants, iailors and
revenue ; and yet when it is shewn that if the
bill pafles without thfe amendment, commerce
will be in a worse situation than at present,
that a war will be more prejudicial to com
merce than even the present slate of things,
gentlemenforgettheobjeCtofthebill t andfpeak
of infamy and of the absurdity of calculating
on pounds, shillings and pence on a question
of defence, though the bill itfelf is introduced
for the express purpose of proteCtTng pounds,
shillings and pence.
For what purpose, said Mr. G. was this
bill brought in > Was it for the protection of
commerce, or far the purpose of producing
war? His idea was that it was intended to
afford protection te 'commerce, and wishing
commerce to be proteCled, he introduced the
amendment under and had at
tempted to shew that it would, anfwertbat
purpose. He had confidcred it on the ground
on which it was brought in as a fair fubjeCtof
calculation.
Mr. G. said, he went upon the idea, that
when peace (hall be reflored in Europe, we
shall be refiored to the fame situation in which
wc were before the war, not that he.expected
full compenfationtobe made to our merchants
for their loffts, but tfiat in oth*r respeCts we
should be reflored Â»o the full enjoyment .of.
our commercial and national rights. The
committee had, however been told that the
â¢bjeCt of France is after the conclufien of the .
European war to fubjngate and deluge our
country snr"blood, i{ not refilled. Mr. G. said
he would not undertake to correct those wild
ideas. He owned he had himfelf no fears of
actual invasion or lubjugation ; but if he had,
what would be the belt Way of preventing it f
Are we to throw ourjfelves into war to do it ?
Would our making war prevent the supposed
consequences of war ? Will it prevent the in
vasion or rujn ps England, which the gentle
l man I'eeins to apprehend f Will it increase
our resources, or put ourrevenue upon a bet
ter footing than at present ? It certainly would
not.
B.ut a geatleman (-Mr. Dana) had infixed
that the grafting of convoys will not produce
a state of war. He has taken a position pecu
liar to hiinfelf ; for the other gentlemen who
opposed this amendment, spoke of our pre
sent ltale as a .state of war. The gentleman
from Maflachufetts called it a commercial
war. The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.
Dana) does not deny that the consequence
of granting convoys may be fighting, but,
notwithftandmg that, though there is no dif
ference in fadt betwixt fighting and war, that
gentleman rests his argument upon certain
circumstances belonging to a state of war and
which will not attach to a state of fighting,
before war isaftuatly declared ; such as that
the property of Frenchmen here, and of A
merican citizens in France would not be liable
to sequestration, that it would not be treason
' for Americans to hold a correspondence with
the French Government. But how will this
apply to the present question ? When he and
those who support his motion qÂ£>jeft to the
granting of convoys as leading to a state of
war, it is because it will produce a worfeitate
of things than the present ; and will it belefs
mischievous, because sequestration and trea
son would not attach as it would do in a state
of war f If the gentleman would prove that
the (late which would be produced by convoys
was not as bad as war, he should have (hewn
t that it would not be attended with the evils
of war, and nothave dwelt upon mere verbal
or legal distinctions betwixt the two states.
It did not appearto him to be any great source
of consolation to fay, though we engage in
hostility which will make all our property at
sea liable to capture, yet our citizens may go
over to France or hold correspondence with
the French Government, without being liable
to punifhnient. His opinion was, that to
produce hostility in this way would be worse
than an open declaration of war, because we
should foft'er all the evils of war, without hav
ing either the power of punishing traitors or
that of retaliating by making reprisals and
captures in our turn. If gentlemen were de
termined upon war, therefore, he fliould wish
them to propose an open declaration of it,
The gentleman from Connedticut drew ano
ther diftindtion, which was, that felf-defenee
was not hoftility.Tliough he knew the laws of
nations spoke ofadifcrimination betwixt these
two states, he would venture to fay that it was
a diftinftion in terms, and n6t in faft. That
gentleman had also remarked, that to grant
letters of marque and to make reprisals, is not
war, but an intermediate state betwixt peace
and war. It was true, that writers on the
laws of nations have made diftinftions of this
kind ; but he believed the gentleman could
point to no instance in the present century,
where letters of marque have been granted,
in which wardid not succeed them. War,
indeed, has commenced sometimes by partial
hostilities, sometimes by granting letters of
marque, sometimes by convoys, sometimes
by reprisals, and sometimes by taking what
werecalled measures of felf-defence. When
ltnas not been thought proper to coineHW
open war at once, measures of this kind have
been carried on for two or three years, during
which time all the evils of war have existed,
without its being aftually declared. He did
not wifti to follow this course.
The gentleman from Connedticut 'seemed
to rely much upon another principle, viz.
that veflels, when under convoy, are not lia
ble to be searched. Now he called upon that
gentleman to prove his aflertion j to prove
that when government grants a convoy, it
was to be a l'ufficient proof that the veflels
under its care had nothing contraband, or im
proper on board. He denied the position to
be founded. And in every cafe of this kind,
the event would depend on Hie strength of the
convoy or the force attacking it. Convoys in
time of war have r.ever been refpedted, ex
cept where the belligerent powers apprehend
ed an open rupture with the neutral power to
whom the convoy belonged.
But the fadt was, Mr. G. said, he did not
consider it very important what was the law
of nations on this head ; because he knew
that the present belligerent powers had whol
ly disregarded both the laws of nations and
ftipulatians of treaties; that France had pros
trated them altogether, and therefore given
us juftifiable cause of war, and the question
was in faft whether we think it our interest to
declare war against her, or not. Gentlemen
o* both fides have said they do not w'ifli to
declare war. He therefore went upon that
ground, and if we take measures grounded on
the right we derive fromrhe4aws of nations,
which we know the belligerent powers do not
refpeft, those measures will as certainly pro
duce war, as if we were at once to declare it.
Why, then, said Mr. G. will those gentle
men who do not chufe to coine forward with
a declaration of war (though they are witting
to go to war without this declaration) tell us
we mean to submit to Franceâthat we have
not the spirit of Americansâthat we mean to
invite farther aggrellions from that country ?
We might, said he, retort the charge upon
them, and fay they wished to involve the
country in war, at the fame time that they
dure not declare it although they thereby de
prive America of any advantages to be de
rived from such a state.
Mr. G. said that no gentleman had attemp
ted to account for that inconsistency, and in
deed there were many other unaccountable
proceedings 011 the part of some gentlemen on
that floor. Whence, for instance, the pro
digious. clamour on the fubjedt of the late dis
patches ? Gentlemen go at large into all the
inofficial converfatious which take place be
twixt our Envoys and certain persons who
are laid to have been Agents of the French
Minister, and they then insist that the know
ledge of those conventions must neceflartly
change our opinions in relation to measures to
be adopted. But he would lay, that the rea
ding of these difpatclies had added only one
circumstance to the knowledge we had alrea
dy of the insults and injuries committed by
France against this Country, which jwas that
they want money from.us. Every fhing else
that could have any effeft upon their delibe
rations, was as well known before the arrival
of those difpatehes, asfince; for it would not
be said that because certain individuals in the
government of France are corrupt, orchi.fe
to fay there are parties in this country, or
speak difrefpedtfully of their own Govern
ment, that a knowledge of these circumstan
ces could have any feriousefl'eft upon the aits
of Congress. It was true these dispatches
had produced one eifedt upin their delibera
tions. Be/orc they were communicated a re
solution was under difcullion declaring,
" that under the present situation of things,
it is not expedient to resort to war against
France 1 ' which, after tfce promulgation of
these dispatches v. as postponed to a distant
day, as improper for farther difcullion at this
which could make any att necelTary that was
not neceflarv before they were read irr Con
gress. For 'if war, or war measures, or mea
sures offeif defence were neceflary, it was
not becaufethere were corrupt individuals in
the Frfenoh Government, or because those in
dividuals or that Government wanted money
from us. They ask money, we refufe it, and
if this was all, there would be an end of the
business. But the true ground of offence on
the part of France, the offence which gave us
a juftifiable cause of war, it we thought it for
our interest to make war, and which therefore
gave ui a right to take any measures hdwever
leading to wjr v/ 6 thought proper, conlifted
in reiterated depredations upon our trade and
in the refufaf of receiving or treating with our
Envoys expressly sent for the purpose of ne
gociating on that fubjeft. And those cap
tures and that obstinate refufal for a period of
tout months wereknown.to us befere the dis
patches were communicated. What do there
fore the dispatches amount tot To disgrace
certain individuals in the French government,
and of course that government itfelf, to a cer
tain degree. And why should the knowledge
of thatÂ°fadt change the opinion of Congress,
and induce them to adopt different measures r
Mr. G. thought that the gentlemen whp ex-,
pedted so great effects from those papers,
grounded their expeditions upon an errone
ous idea theyhad previolifly conceived. They
have supposed that gentlemen who differed
in opinion .from them, have all along afted
under an idea that there was attached to the
French revolution and to the Frencji Govern
ment a superior degree of justice, virtue and
purity, ancThaving once eftabliftied this idea
in their minds, they will fuppole that a dis
covery of a cdrrupt mind in a number of per
sons in France, will produce a revolution in
their minds. Stippofing also that such mem
bers had been actuated in thdir conduft, not
so much by wishes for the good of this coun
try, as by a blind admiration for the French
Republic, they naturally conclude that adif
covery of corruption in the councils of that
country, will work a wohdecful change in our.
conduct andiopiaions. â¢ *
And alio becaufc*lfte communication of the
inftruclions to our Envoys, had fully convin
ced every one that the Prefident.of the Uni
ted States had, by those inftrudtions, made
concefiions to the full extent of what cottkl
be made by this country ; it is now expedted
that every past measure of the Executive (hall
be approved, and every proposition coming
from that quarter fhatl be supported by the
very gentlemerj. who may heretofore have re
probated some of those measures, or opposed
some of those propositions. That expectati
on, the expedtation of a change of copduci|jjn
those gentlemen arose from the fame fallaci
ous idea that because some gentlemen have
less confidence in the Executive rhan others,
that want of confidence has heretofore didta
ted measures injurious to their country, and
contrary to their duty.
Mr. G. then said he would take some notice
of some of the arguments which had been u
sed by the gentleman from Maflachufetts
(Mr. Otis). That gentleman has stated, that
if convoys are not granted, war will be as
likely to be produced by the arming of mer
chant veflels as by convoys, and that the ves
sels having been permitted by the President to
arm, no objedtion ought to be made to the
employment of public vetrels as convoys.
' He frottfd jttft ob/crvcthat irriotlior gentle
man was jmiflaUep when lie supposed that he
(Mr. G.) Was of opinion that merchant vef
lels had not a right to arm by the custom of
Nations. He had no doubt that they had
that right, and that it was ex'ercifed by neu
tral powers ; but this difficulty arose in the
question when it was lately presented to the
house, viz. that of permitting veflels to arm,
after they had been forbidden by the Presi
dent to do so for a number of years. The
right had been abandoned by that refiriftion
and the acquielcenfe of the Legislature, and
having been it made a great
change of the grouna taken at the beginning
of European hostilities. But whatever aft of
hostility might be produced by the arming of
these veflels, it would be a much less evil
than those resulting from granting of convoys.
The difference betwixt the two cases must be
obvious. When merchantmen do arm they,
like any individual who may carry arms, are
answerable for the abuse of those arms, and
government are not; whereas government
will not have to answer for the condudt of
the commanders of public veflels.
But the gentleman fays, a commercial war
already exii's. Mr G. said he did not mean
to dispute about words ; but if he called the
present a state of commercial war, that state
would be changed by the grantingof convoys.
Notwithstanding all the losses we have expe
rienced during the present war, it was a iaft
that our tonnage and exports have greatlyia
creafed, so that our commerce is now in a
more ftourifliing state than at the commence
ment of the war. Mr. G. then took a view
of the different amount of our tonnage-at dif
ferent peitods, and proved that it had been
increased 60 per cent since the year 1791 ; so
that he did not think our affairs were so des
perate, as to drive us into a was to retrieve
them. He alio shewed that the tonnage of
Great Britain had funk in ronfequence of the
war, from 206,000 tons, which it was in 1792,
to 19,600, which it was when the last returns
were made.
I nan adtual state of war, not only our ton
nage will be reduced, but every evil we now
experience will be increased ten-fold. Not
only ourrevenue will be cut off, but our ina
bility to pay at home will be increased. If
gentlemen think the question of revenue is a
question which ought not to be considered,
but that we ought to go forward without cofi
fidering any thing as to our ways and means,
can they deny that a state of war will not
only fink ourrevenue, but that it will at once
affeft our merchants, our seamen, and every
other description of citizens.
The gentleman from Maflachufetts tells
the committee that though we preserve the
present state of things, France will not permit
os to trade to Holland, Spain, the Italian
ports or the Hanfe Towns, and that she will
continue to capture our veflels upon frefh pre
tences. If that gentleman does believe, that
unless we. do take some aitive measures,
France will not permit us to trade with these
places, but that she will add to aggreflions al
ready committed, by capturing all our veflels,
then we must declare war. It is poflible, per
haps probable, that this event may take
place ; but they ought to aft upon exifling
circumstances, and not upon conjedture only.
But the gentleman from Maflachufetts went
farther, and said, that from the nature of our
exports, that France could not, in time of war,
shut the port&of Spain, Holland, the Italian
ports, and the Hanfe Towns; so that, ac
cording to his dodtrine, in time of war, we
should have a better chance to carry our pro
duce to those countries under the influence of
France, than at .present. [Mr. Otis ex
plained.] The fame gentleman also stated,
Â°i ur trac ' e was t0 be convoyed by Bru
tifh (hips, the expence mull be borne by tht
citizens of this country ; and that, therefore
aS we " our own convoys in the
firft instanceâBut lie would ask that gentle
man, whether, in cÂ»fe of war, our 12 fhipi
were likely to give a better protettion to com.
merce than the immense navy of Great Bri
tain, and whether therefore that event would
not render British convoys still more necefTary,
and give to the "British shipping the most de
cided advantage over our navigation ?
But it was stated, that he and those wKo
voted with him were willing to defend the
foil, but would give up the property of our
citizens on the ocean. He was witling w
give this species of property all the protects
on we have it in our power to give, and if hie
believed that the present stare of things wa. a,
bad as war, war, heWild immediately ,
abandon his amendment. In such a cafe, he
would do all he could to protect our trade by
armed veifels. In 1775, Congress gave that
protection; and in tune of war, he should be
ieady to give it ; but to grant a convoy in the'
present (late of things, would be in lirs opini.
0n,,t0 injure the merchants and sailors, and
not to serve them.
Mr. G. then apologized for the manner in
which he had replied to the obfervatious made
011 that day. Compelled to fit without inter
ruption to so Jate an hour, (it was then near -
o'clock) exhausted as his faculties must be'
and under a necessity of angering immediate!
ly the.ipeeches of gentlemen who had occu
pied the whole fitting, he had it pot in his
power to arrange his arguments as he might '
have wished, but he could only remarkon
the obfervatious of those gentlemen just as
they happened to occur to his mind.
iMuch had been fa id on the motives and
conduit of those gentlemen who supported
the amendment. Much illiberal and un
founded abufc had been poured upon them
and particularly upon him. It was well
known that having never conceived personal
abuse as a fit topic for this houfe.oras a ground
of'argument any where, he had uniformly
treated it with that lilent contetnpt it deserv
ed. So far as related to thofe'vague, and ge
neral imputations which had been made, he
would ffill neat them in that maimer, he
would not condescend to enter into a
cation against charges of so loose a nature.
But he would, for onetf, make a few observa
tions en those. attacks where the .member to -i
his right (Mr. Allen) had ventured to make
any thing like a fpecific charge.
In the firft place, he had stated, that A num
ber of members of Congress, in the year'l794,
were willing, at that time, to take much high
er ground than at present. The gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Madison) was charged
with faying, that he had no hopes from nego
ciation, and that therefore it was necefTary tÂ»
adopt measures for cuirfelves ; and from the
manner in .which this was quoted, it might
be supposed, that the question re
fpedt to obtaining redress for captures, and.
that Mr. Madison had dclared that if redress
could not fee had by negociation, it mu ft be
had by force. What, said he, was the ques
tion then nndereonfideration > It was a ques
tion of commercial regulation, which did not
relate to any infringement of our neutral
rights, but which had application altogether
to a state of peace. The British having made
certain commercial regulations, the question
then debating, was one intended tocoiinteraft
the effeft of those regulations. And it was
said, that no hopes were entertained that by
negociation Great-Britain would recede from
the steps she had takÂ«t; -and thtrrti ere fore the
imly way to counters# was by adopting coun
ter regulations ourselves. And the faÂ£t prov
ed that those gentlemen wete right ; Great-
Britain had not weeded, and the British trea
ty contained stipulations which went to pre
vent Congress from making, in future., any
such regulations as were then proposed.'
Another gentleman fiom Virginia (M. Ni
cholas) was eharged by the fame gentleman
with having thought differently with refpeft
to the advantages derived by this country
from the carrying trade, when the depredati
ons of Great-Britain and Algiers, were under
consideration. On the contrary, if the con
duct of that gentleman was examined, it
would be found, that he was always opposed
to measures which, in their effects, might lead
to war. If the conduit of the two parties in
the hotife, at that time was looked into, it
would be found that the gentlemen who now
opposed war against France, had opposed it
against England at that time, that they had a
dopted only such Ineafures as in their opini
on would induce or compel Great-Britain to
change her conduct, without the neeedity of
recurring to war : such a? a suspension of
commercial intercourse ; but at that fme
those gentlemen did not threaten vai nor
were they in favor of provisional armies,
naval armaments, arming .merchantmen*
granting convoys, or any other war mea
sure whatever.
The member of Connefticut had also re
presented him as opposed to the proclamation
of neutrality of she Prr-fiJi m, *and as a Tup
porter.of the meafureJ'of the French niimiter
Mr. Genet. [Mr. Allen said he spoke of the
French party in this country being always Â®p
pofed. to it, and not him in particular. ] Mr.
G. said Mr. A. might now unlay what lie'had
stated yesterday. But indeed had the remark
only fallen from him, he-did not believe that
he would have noticed it. But it was ndt4ie
â alone who had referred to this.' oppofitios.
The gentleman frdm S. Carolina (Mr. Har
per) had entertained the house for some time
011 the fame fabject, on a former occa(iÂ»n,
and insisted upon It that the fame ggntlemen
who wish now to preserve peace, when we
had a dispute with Great-Britain, were all in
favour of war; and with refpeit to the pro
clamation of neutrality, the gentleman from
S. Carolina aflerted, that though gentlemen
firft were violently opposed to it, yet, when
(Tongrefs met ibme time afterwards, the peo
ple having in the mean time shewn their ap
probation of the measure, they dared not ex
press their disapprobation with the conduit
of the Executive. This fhewsthat neither of
the gentlemen are acquainted with facts ; be
cause the public records of the country will
give a direit contradiction to their allerttorcs.
In 1793, when M. Genet arrived in this
country, and took such steps as went to an in
fringement of our neutral rights, and the Pre
sident issued his Proclamation of Neutrality,
the firft public b>dy which met afterihat pe
riod was the Legislature of Pennfvlvania (ot
which he was then a member) and he must he
permitted to fay, that this Legislature was
(what gentlemen term) a very Jacobinic bo
dy. No better proof, he supposed, could be
given of this than that they elected him (<y ri
G.) a Senator of the United States. Tins le
gislature met before it could be ascertained
what was the public voice, and the nn' tlung
they did was to present an address to the Go
vernor, exprelTing their unanimous approba
tion of the conduct of the prudent of the
United States, with refpedt to his Proclama
tion of Neutrality, a"d all she other steps he
had taken in support of thit neutrality, name
ly, the preventing French privateers from
being fitted in our ports, and the seizure and
reftoratioii of prizes TnÂ«de by those privateers.He would add, that that part s( Ac address,- j
which he read, was drawn by himfelf. The 1 i
Go-vernor of Pennsylvania, whom gentlemen I c
vtfll also doubtlels term a Jacobin) fortified { S
Mud Island during the recess of the Legifla- I 1
ture, in order to carry into effeft the mea- )
fures'of the Executive, borrowing money for i 1
the purpose on his own private credit, and f
the fame Legislature approved his conduit c
and made the neceflary appropriations. Be- f
fore gentlemen indulged themselves in ma
king these charges, tliey should take a little
,pains to n\ake themselves acquainted with â¢
facts* for he was persuaded that their preju
dices were in a great degree to be alcribed to I
their wjntoif information.
As to the general charge of the wish of those I
who supported the amendment meant to sub
mit to the claims of the French Republic, he
would Cay, that to submit to those claims, or
to recognize theth would be degrading ; but
that to fuffer the present date of things to
continue, was a temporising measure, dicta
ted under the present ctrcumftances by the
founded policy Tt is true that the aggrefli
ons received from the French, exceed every
thing which has taken place during the
course of the war; but on the other hand
every day draws nearer the period when war
jjiuft have an end in Europe. This confeder
ation, with him, outweighed the great extent
of depredations which might otherwise induce
him to take a different line of conditdt. If in
1793, or 1794, depredations had been made
to their present extent,it might have been tho't
better to have become parties in the war,
than to remain neutral. We wire jufiified
for not doing so at that time, from the depre-
more confined. The depreda
tions were now much greater, but the period
farwh : ch the war could continue, had become
much shorter. When he considered thegrow
ing resources of this Ctfuntrjfc, which, if we
can elcape war, will everyday improve ; when
he considered tlwt our wealth and population
were increasing beyond calculation, he con
feffed it was. with r,igat reluctance he aban
doned the Jjjd hope of prcferving peace. He
considered that the event of war mud be the
hfcfs of that property which they were propo
fuig to protect; the loss of our commerce, of
our tonnage, the ruin of our merchants, and
the abandonment of our sailors. The natural
â¢tonfequence muftb'ethat tbelofsof-ourreven
ue must be ftipported by heavy taxes on our
lands and internal consumption, and the ex
pences of the war must be supported by loans
borrowed at an interefl proportioned to the
wants of the country, so that our debt will be
increased in propoition to our efforts to pro
tect our commerce in time of war, that is to
fay, in proportion to the increase ofjour navy,
. the effects of which would be felt tor a long
time after the war Ihould cease. Taking all
these things into conlideration, he would ra
ther bear the captures now rriade of our pro
perty âhe would rather fee a total want of
Bijjtifh manufaitures, and .abandon that part
of. onr trade, than take measures which will
not only be war, but worse than war.
Under these considerations it was that he
proposed the present amendment ; if it was
not carried, he certainly should submit to the
decisions of a majority. It would remain
>Â»ith the President to apply the force as he
jhall think fit; but when an amendment was
proposed, the object of which was to prevent
war, he did not expeft to be charged with
â wishing to submit to the surrender of the in
dependence of the country. If he had pro
posed to pay the money which the agents of
the French government demanded, or to re
coenize by treaty the unjuftifiable violations
oflhejaw of nations made by that <-Â«uttJxyT
or have refufed to have taken measures for
pur defence, there might have been some
ground for the charge. Indeed as long as
gentlemen declined proposing a declaration of
â war, they had no right to make the charge.
For while no such proportion was made, he
and those who supported his amendment
might retortypon gentlemen, and fay, " You
fay France has given 11s jultifiable cause of
â¢war, and yet you maan to fubmife and will
not deplare war."
He must (uppofe therefore, that gentlemen
opposed this amendment because they did not
believe that to employ these veflels as con
voys would destroy every hope of peace. He
acknowledged peace was not altogether in our
power. France might declare war to-mor
row, or give an order to seize all our veflels ;
but so long as the fact was not so, it cannot
be denied that there is some hope that the
itate of peace may not be broken ; to preserve
that hope he urged his amendment.
Mr. G. concluded with faying that not
withstanding all the violent charges and per
sonal abuse which had been made against him
it would produce no difference in his manner
of acting, neither prevent him from speaking
against any measure which he thought injuri
pus.to the public interefl, nor on the' other
hand inflame his mind so as to induce him to
Oppose measures which he might heretofore
have thought proper. Neither afear of slan
der, norof violent attacks in that House, nor
even of that compulGoa threatened by the
" member from Connecticut, fhoultj ever pro
duce any change in his votes or in his cdn
-.-dutt.

An alarm was fired yesterday evening,
which has proved to be for his Majesty's (hip
Matilda, with an American (hip and schoo
ner, and 2 French privateers a brig of 16
guns and a (loop -of 10 gun 9. âThe Ame
rican (hip was bound to Guadaloupe,
with French property; and paflengers.
We are assured that 18 fail of American
veflels have been taken within these few
days, and carried into St. Martins.
We have been very obligingly favoured
with the following extraft from a Log book
of tile Dauifii bjjg, called the Adventure
which failed from Cadiz on the 2d of Feb
ruary and was sent into St. Kitts on Satur
day last by the Requin.
" February 6th, the Spauifh fleet failed

five of which were three Deckers, the fame
fleet returned to Cadiz on the 13th, and on
the 14th Lard St. Vincent with his whole

"PHILADELPHIA ,
THURSDAY EVENING, Max 3
The House of ReprefenfanvesorrheUnited
Stares, yesterday, took tip the report on the
ftibject of the naturalization of aliens, when
Mr. Harper proposed to amend the report
by providing that citizenfliip in this country
should be obtained in 110 other way thÂ«n by
birth. This amendment being declared by
the chairman of the committee of the whole
to be a substitute to the resolution of the re
port underconfideration,Mr. Otis proposed
an amendment which wet)t,to exclude all fo
reigners, who are no mow citiz#A&,. from en
joying any office of honoot' under
the United States. Mr. Harper moved to
amend this, by reftrifting all such foreigners
from voting at any eleftion ; but it having
been suggested to hint, he said, that such a re
gulation would be unconditiitional, he with
drew it, until he looked into the fiibjetft.
The committee rose, without coming to any
decision. The bill to provide compensation
for marshals, clerks, jurors and witnelTes, un
derwent some difcuflion, and was re-commit
ted to a committee of sixteen members.
CITIZEN FF.KKO !
THE prowefj of the American Lion
is preserved in deathless son?, is eloquence
less deferring of applause ?âThe fvveet
breath of the tuneful choir (hall render it
also immprtal !
Emulous of paying tribute to civic merit,
the Revolutionary Tribunal of Parnassus
has decreed, that the celebrated orations of
this far famed Democrat, which have been
lately roar'd and encor'd throughout the
continent, (hall be rendered into the language
of the Muses.
ConGderable progress has already been
made in this- work, the patronage of our
â worthy co-patripts mull determine the time
of its completion.
ThatÂ»/paragon of eloquence, his apologe
tic oration, pronounced soon after the ce
lebrated battle, on account of its extreme
length, is referred for a nobler destiny, it
forms the X. book of the Leonad, an Epic
Poem, second in merit to the Iliad alone,
and which the learned world mayfoonexpedt
to receive from thehands of the .Great Scrib
lerius !
Thus it is Citizen, that Republicans re
ward civic merit, how much more inestima
ble than Stars and Garters the gewgaws,
with which our ancient tyrants adorned their
slaves !
Come then, Citizen Fentio, and with the
fraternal embrace, the dear pledge of our
affedion, receive this petrlefs document of
Genius, impress it on that page ever
dear to Freemen and terrible to Tyrants.â
In doing this, you will deserve well of the
Republic, your name fliall be inserted in the
Bulletin of Parnassus, where nothing finds
a place unworthy of honourable mention.
