above. '
MACHIAVEL wasanenthufiaftforliber- '
ty, -n;d an ardentdefende'r of theliberty of his (
country. He engaged in fevrral conspira
cies to deliver Florepce, his native city,from
the usurpation of'-the Medicis : and nei
ther tie vtngeatce*oF this potent family
could rc'train, nor their fervours extinguish,
the h ;Kd he entertained against the men
whom he regarded as tyrants of his Coun
try. H's genius was v.fl, vigorous aivl
p letrati'.g ; his undtrflanding just ; his
k vled'Je of the moll* varied kind ; his ftu
<lv > - n and things was profound ; and
aity of his mditical refleilions, few
â¢a is have equalled. The history of his
1 r.'c cityi for ages, torn in pieces by pas- ,
{ ui and pariy, fnggefted and verified the
following observations of his.
cities which are administered under
the name of a republic, are continually
chmg'ug their gbverOmajt and their con
dition, not from liberty to slavery, as many
b. !>cve, but from slavery to licentiousness.
For it is the name only of liberty, that is
courted by the populace, the agents of licen
ti'.'ufiicfs, or by nobles, the agents of slave
ry ; each of them having it equally in view,
to free from all fuhje&ion, either
to laws or to men. And it is a truth, that
â when it Intppensv (which rarely happens)
that by the gond fortune or a city, there
rifcs in it, a wife, a good, and a potent citi
zeu, to establish laws, by which these paf
60'ns Â»>f the nobles, and the people, may be
ftiifed, or, so rellraiijed, that they can work
no evil, then only may this city be called
free, and its government be deemed firm and
liable. 1
For being founded on good laws and wife
regulations, it needs not, like other dates, I
the virtue of any one man to maintain it.â
Such laws and regulations several of the an
cient republics (those of them which had a
ny long duration) had the good fortune to
enjoy. And those dates whicji wanted or
wa it Inch laws and regulations, wire and
are continually changing their governments,
from tyranny to anarchy, and from this to
something else : because, in them, by the
powerful enemies which each of these forms
of government hath, there neither is nor can
be any (lability ; for the one does not please
good men, and the other wile men;
the one can easily do mifchief, and the other
can hardly do good ; in the one, insolent
men have too much authority, and in the
other fools ; and neither the one nor the o
ther can be maintained but by the virtue and
fortune of some one man, who may soon be
removed by death, or rendered useless by
his labours.
To apply the observations to ourselves.
We have a conditution, which effe&ually
secures us from tyranny, by redraining eve
ry branch of the ajlminidration within due
bounds. Our gacat danger if* from a dis
regard of the laws, from licentipufcefs, from
amrehy. Let us condautly beware of
.Shjofe men, who inflame our pallions, by
speaking ill cf the adminidraton of that gov
ennment, in which our liberty and bappiuefs
consist* Under the' pretence of regard for
<Â»( liberties, they court us firft to Bate ;
then, to defplfe, and then to refill/the Jaws,
violate the government, degenerate into li
centiousness, plunge into anarchy, and bury
ourselves in ruin.

ticular the above Idlinger, who, together .
with ViCtor Hughes, are well known to be wll
as finifhed villains as ever disgraced the

But to increase our artittWy to almost two ca
' thousand men, to add a little to our dange- an
. roufly large navy is an engine to encreafe the an
power of the executive or to bring about w(
this despotic government so mueh dreaded
by Mr. Clay.'' Why was this doCtriue not I
made use of a little while ago when the Brit ce
i(h were seizing our veflels, imprefllng our p,
a seamen and threatening us with a war ? If u
Howcomes it about that it (hould be right 1 m
to defend ourselves against the Briti(h and I m
:! under similar circumstances paflively bend Is a
our. necks to the yoke of the French ? When b,
( the Briti(h were committing depredations on I w
us, the diforganizcrs were all ready for Ip,
', war, anxious to arm and to join the French If r
in hostilities, amicable negociation was out e(
of the question, the haughty Britons must be J b
i! made to stoop. The friends to government jf,
were then friends to an amicable negociatian I â
rc and have succeeded, and the more we expe- It<
i rience the of the British treaty so 1 1]
much reprobated a little while ago, the less I
is, exceptionable does it appear. I appeal then I g
to my fellow citizens whether this friendly I ||
negotiation which has made the planter and I c
the farmer rich and independent, which I g
has evidently given the high price I _
for our prodoce and particularly to- 1 t
bacco, waving the circumstance of our peace I a
and happiness at home was not more advif?- I a
able than to be plnnged into a dedruCtive I j
war with that nation out of which we are r
n â¢ getting our wealth. The misfortune is, I r
the French have toq. many blind followers in I i
me thiscountry devoted entirely to their interest, I {
enemies to their own country and rea<3y for 1 1
rr. any rnterprife which that nation might mark I;
out for them ; thus it is that there (hould I)
be such a party anxious to go to war against j |
~ Great Britain willing for the French to raise 1 1
armies in the heart of our country, and to 1 1
eftablilh French tribunals to try causes in j
our towns. Thus it is that while the French | j
are feiaing our veflels, plundering our prop- I,
erty, throwing our seamen Into dungeons, 1
and impelling the Spaniards to aCts of hostil
ities against, and violating express treaties, I ;
their friends are juftifying their conduit (or I
keeping a secret for the people) thus it is I
those then are opposed to taking any mea- j
, sure of defence, even while the French had
! ete armed frigates in our bay, threatening our I
t i ve commerce, nay, actually seizing our veflels,, I
and insulting our authorities, and thus it is I
that their friendsamong us,or rather enemies I
'â¢ to our government, were opposed to repair I
at " the few fortifications we have, and choose I
j that they (hould rot rather than be made ca- I
pable of affording defence.. The policy of I
our government at present is that which eve- I
:he ry prudent man would pursue in his individ- I
of ual capacity were he injured by his neigh- 1
an ' a bour or former friend. To prepare for I
loclc the worst but endeavour tÂ» fettle the dif- I
j pute amicably by agreement, negociation, I
i; n g and arbitration, and not delay taking .mea- j
fures of defence until surrounded by hods of I
Jeut enemies. This appears to me to be agree- I
'â  able to common sense and common pru- I
dence ; yet strange a 6 it may seem, there are
1 ' characters among us, utterly opposed to de
-5 fence when to keep their friends the French
from invading our country. But we are de

For detailing to you such inflammatory in

prove to you that ourprefident has most se
riously cherished every effectual Hep towards
a reconciliation with Trance âand (hall tur

in" such a view that you will be at no loss
to fay who are the real war-ha-wh ; who
Willi to fifli in troubled waters, and who ivifh
to J peculate in f/jldiers certificates. Our pre

ment of the late revolution to this moment,
has conduced himfelf, in all the stations in
.which he lias been placed, in such* manner
36 has justly entitled him to the greuteft
confidence of his fellow citizens. I l>at
well-timed honed republican charadter
which he had acquired in the commence
ment of the American revolution, and
which puffed on with him through our
dreadful conflict, has never been assailed but
by envy, misrepresentation, a:<d the enven
omed tongue of detraction ; ahd strange it
may seem", his hods of enemies are compel
led to applaud his unbounded candor and
integrity, and to admit his pre-eminent ta
lents and judgment.âlf I were to
ask you whatqualifications a president (hould
have, would you require more of him than
Mr. Adams possesses ? Would you expeCt
greater honesty, njore candor, or greater
talents ?
I will not only call the president's gene
ral character in view, but (hall apply his
particular condijCt to prove, that his great
care has been to preserve our independence,
and to cultivate peace.with all the wofld,
and particularly with the French. When
we firft htard that our veflels, without num
ber, were captured by the French.; that
bur property could not escape capture and
j certain condemnation ; that the ministers oi
France in this country were repeatedly in-

LANSINGBURGH, September 12.
The merchants, traders' and other -gen
tlemen of Lanfingburgh, have lately held
a meeting on the fubjeft of improving our
navigation ,â¢ and we are happy to learn, that
they were ur.animoufly in favour of the un
dertaking. And in order to determine its
feafibilitf, and to obtain a probable eltimate
of the expense, they appointed a commit
tee to engage 3b able engineer, to explore
riie l iver, to confer with him, and to ob
tain his opinion and estimates on the fub
jeft. The result to be laid before a subse
quent meeting.
We arc informed the committee have
written' to the ingenious Mr. Prefcot, of
Northampton, to come up on this business,
and that he is soon expefted. As Mr. P.
has for several years ftudicd hydraulics as a
fciencc, and matured his theory by aftual
prafticf, as chief engineer in the important
works carrying on in the"Connefticut river,
and which in several parts are completed,
and answer the most sanguine expeftations,
mo doubt can be entertained of his exteufive
knowledge on this fubjeft, and that the
committee have afted judiciously in makiiig
application to him.
The Latin school, in the Lanfingburgh
academy, was opened on Monday fe'nnight.
The preceptorfhip of this academy ig con
fided to Mr. Chauncey Lee, a gentleman
whose literary talents, abilities as a teacher,
and moral charafter, eminently qualify him
to preside over this rising seminary.
The English schools of the academy are
under the 1 care of two excellent teachers,

THE LAUNCH.
It will be high water this day, at eighteen
rtiinutes after 11, at which time the Conjl't
â  tution frigate quit the cradle of her birth ;
and repair to the element of which (he is
! calculated to be the pride and boast.

A correspondent, who lately took a criti
cal view of our new frigate, was struck (he
fays) with the analogy between that ship and
her name, viz. THE CONSTITUTION.
First, her timbers are of our own growth,
found and excellent, and put together judi
ciously and faithfully ; there i 3 no saw-dust
and putty crammed in to fill up flaws and
cracks, and hide joints ; but all is
firm, solid, and connefted like the oak tree
with its branches. Secondly, her figure,
I or general outline, is like the Constitution
beautiful ; an'd (he carries at her head.the
j figure of a Hercules, with his club and lion's
j ikin, and every body knows that by the-alle
i gory ps Hercules is meant heroic virtue.â
â¢ 3dly. The most important part of her, as it
; the fafety of her people, and which
i is inimerfed in a treacherous element, is cov
ered with copper to secure her against those
ftnall but delbuciive vermin, who like #ur
, Jacobifis, tvtyi out ojfight, ..fecretly, lilently
- 1-. .. â

She, like our Canftitiition, is built for tlx
fafety of thep'.ofh and their property ; and car

the meatis of defending it.âsthly. Like
the Conftitufiorr, (he will be conducted by
citizens of different ranks aad power, as to
command and order, b it all conspiring to
form a harmonious whole. Jthly. She will
be commanded by officer-;, whom we can
truil apd will support. 7thly. She will
launch forth into that *e!e:nent which con
nects the world together, as the Conftftution
did into the political one, anvM the Ihouts
arid acclamations of the peoplPvvhofc voice
created her. That Heaven may prQ

In the Chroniele of Monday, it is fneer
ingly said, that " Mr. Adams' negotiations
have terminated in a marriage treaty with an
English lady." This is an imposition on
the public, who ought to be informed, with
out derogating from the merits of the ladies
of England, that Mrs. A. is an.American
Lady ; that her father is a citizen of Mary
land, and brother to his Excellency Thomas
Johnson, Esq. late Governor of that state.

Copy of k letter from Dr. Rush, to a Cor
respondent in this town, dated Philadelphia,
Sept. 11.
DEAR SIR,
The dileafe which now prevails in our ci
ty, was generated among us. Its principal
source was from the hold of the (hip from
Marseilles, in which there was a quantity 6f
putrid vegetablss. Our gutters, and the
ponds of stagnating water in ihc neighbour
hood of thi city have created some cases of
u"t. At present it prevails chiefly in thp
Xouth part of the city. Considering. thaft
nearly one half of our citizens have fled, the
mortality though apparently less, is proba
bly as great as it was at this time of the
year in 1793. From 20 to 30 die daily.
Every poflible exertion is making by our go
vernment, our board of health, and our Phy
sicians, to (top the pmgrefs of the' disease.
When and where it will end, is known only
to that Being who controuhs and governs all
the physical, as well as moral evil of our
world.

to tliufr fraudulent men, by innocent
It i' therefore juil that public information should a Â°. :
be given, tu the end, thattht injured may feekre- lhl
dress while the men hava property, and are to be
found, Those who have been discovered are Tru-
nun Harrifon, Joseph Witcoml/, said now to re- 1
fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and jj,
fcveral othen who go under fictitious names. It is t j, (
supposed that thejnnds offered fcr faleon those fa- di
bri.ated titles, are at lcaft worth fifty thousand ed

as follows : J.ots No. II and 11, Otfe/o patent, fui

Dellwyn, new of London ; lots No. 58 and 64, er<
fame putcnr, thousand acres each, the property of ivi
Mr. Cliaumont, now of Paris, and-lames AveriU
and others, ot thin State. There is some gronfids
to suppose that the lands of Hi-hard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
r management.âThe Printers will do well to give
. this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
[ prire those men in future from on indivi
dusfs, which their education and addrels have en- ; a
abled them to do heretofore. Wiuomb has been f a
a ihopkeeper of feme note in this tountry. fn
The following affidavits will set in a,clear pcint te

the public have perused, wi'l induce them to ex- h;
cufe the ir.tÂ»i{erence of Wm. COOPER.
