Dr. Mifafe has written a letter to the a

certain recent supposed infra&ions of the t
laws of Penrifylvania, refpefting quarantine. x
The doftor concludes thrfs : .
" In cafe permission (hall be hereafter de- j
lv.anded by any matter of a vessel in quaran-: j

legally do, with my present powers, will
be to inform hiin of the events that have

main; but fliould he still wiih to depart, it
is not in my power to prevent him ; for al
though a law passed last year by congress,
dire&s.the commanders of the fgits, in the
fen port towns, to assist the health officers*
of the different states in the execution of I
quarantine on vessels, when called on for I
the purpose ; yet as no law has been passed
by the legislature of Pennsylvania, autho
vifing the employment of force by me,
when the health laws of our state are con
travened, and a compliance therewith (hall
be refufed : I have never made a demand of
this affitlance (except interrorem) evert in
cases where no doubt existed, and (hall not
therefore pretend to use it in others, when :
I am clear that the regulations wished to be j
enforced, will be declared illegal, when I
the proper authority Ihall be consulted
thereon.
" While I have thus, fir, endeavoured
to juftify my conduct, by a candid state
ment to you of she grounds upon which I
afted, on the occasion which is the fubjeft
of your letter, I beg you will do me the
justice to assure the citizens of Burlington, j
that 1 am seriously distressed at the reflec
tion that I fliould have been the unintenti
onal cause of exciting a moment's alarm,
or uneasiness among them ; and which I

that I will with pleasure use all my influ- 1

Extraft of a letter from Dr. Benjamin

* Ton, of this I>lace, dated Sept. 6, 1797.
My Dear Sir,
Your long and intimate conncftion with
our late mutual friend, Dr. Way, may cause
you to wiih to know some particulars of his
death. He wa6 seized on Monday, August
28th, with all the usual symptoms of our
prevailing' yellow fever. He bled himftlf
sparingly twice before 2 o'clock, at which
time lie sent for me. His pulse being full
and tense I urged more plentiful bleeding".
To this h? objefted, pleading his time of
life. He Tiowever contented to his being
twice bled in the afternoon, losing each time
but 6 or 7 ounces of blood, finding his ob
jeftion great to the only remedy which I
thought would be tffeftual in hi 3 cafe, I cal
led Dr. Griffiths to my assistance, who join
ed me in urging more copious bleeding.â
He consented to. two more small bleedings,
one on the 2d, and the other on the 3d day
of his disease. In all, he loft but little more
than 40 ounces of blood, a quantity mod
of our physicians tiow find by far tao {mall J<
to futdue an-acute cafe'of "hur fever." On n
the 4th, stli and 6th daYs his pvtlfe became o
languid, and flow, purge* were given, and rr
cordials prefcribedto no purpose to raise it. S
He died on the 6th day.âl law him at two d
o'clock. He was then finfible, but io weak ii
as to speak with difficulty, he looked at me f
with great tenderness, and his eyesfilled with n
tears. Soon afterwards he was attacked r
with convullions, and died at 6 ofclock in the r
afternoon. I need not tell you who knew t
hip worth, and my lincere regard for him, t
how much I have been afflifted by his death,, t
His was as dear to me as a brother. t

COMMUNICATION. 1
To the Editors of the Colummbian Mirror, t
Gentlemen, <
In your paper of the 7th inft. is inserted <
*a paragraph, (taken from another paper) t
| which states that the differences in the wef- 1
tern country, betwixt Spain and the United i
States, were fettled ; that the commiilion- ;
ers had proceeded .to run the line ; and
that the Spaniards had a force of 10,000 <
men in the province.âYou very justly ob- 1
serve, that this information Joes not agree
with the spirit of the proclamation which 1
you annexed; and theprobability of its truth <
is further to be questioned, by its being fta
j ted that the fame person who gave the infor- '
j mation, brought dispatches to Philadelphia <
J from the representatives of/too different pow
ers âa thing in itfelf absurd. However,leav
ing the wide field of conjecture, I will some
to the fads. lam but this moment arri
ved from the Spanilh dominions by the way
of Natchez, which place I left about the
middle of July, and I a flu re you that then
1 there was no more probability of the differ
| ences being fettled than there was before,
things remained in the fame state they had
done for some time ; in faft, some ftiort
time since, there was not so much as an ap
pearance of a pacific difpofitio* : for the in
j habitants of tho diftriA of the Natchei, en
' raged at the delay of the Spaniards, in not
delivering up the forts, rose en majfe, and
kept the Governor close confined in th* fort
. for the space of 12 days, and he was afraid
' then to venture out until he had signed ar
; tides of capitulation drawn up by the inha
bitants, in which they secured to themlelvei
many valuable privileges, until the differen
ces between the two powers fliould be fet
tled. These articles were sent down to the
I Baron de CarondelÂ«t, for confirmation, and
I the dispatch bringing the ratifications, arri
i ved at Natchez the day I left it.
With refpeÂ£l to the Forces of the Spani
| ards in that quarter, they are precisely this 1
At New Madrid, [the firft settlement on
entering the Miffifippi from the Ohio) there
are between 30 and 40 men without any fort ;
at Chickafaw Bluffs, there is a ftrjeant and
12 men ; at the Walnut Hills, I cannot pre
cisely tell the number, as I did not stop
there ; at Natchez, there are between 30
and 40 ; and at New-Orleans, there are so
few as not to be able to do the duty of the
garrison, so that the inhabitants are called
upon to perform that ferticeâa talk, of
which they complain bitterly. These are the
mighty forces which the Spaniards have on
that river;âhowever, I can easily conceive
1 how the information came. If I am not
â¢ mistaken, it was brought by one Thomas
1 Power, who has brought dispatches lately in
' to the United States, but for whom, no one
knew when he left the Natchez. He is the
fame person who was flopped on the Ohio
about 12 months ago by lieutenant Steele,
by command of the late General Wayne,
> and hi* papers seized. He was fufpe&ed
1 of .coming with a design to alienate the as
' fe&ions of the inhabitants of the western
r countries from the Union, and to attach
, them to Spain ; it is supposed that this fe
, cond trip to our country has in it something
of a similar designâhe migkt have political
- views in representing the strength of the
â  Spaniards much greater than it really is.
As to the preient amicable disposition of
' the Spaniards, and their wish to carry the
; treaty into effeft, I wrll giv<: you two re
cent instances. Mr. M'Cluney, of Wash
, ington, in Washington county, (Pennfyl
: vania) lately went down the Mississippi
" with a cargo of flour : at Walnut Hills,
c when he went afliore to shew his passport,
a the commandant of the place told him that
e he wanted the flour that was in his boat.
Mr. M'Cldney told him, U>at if he would
-. give him 14 dollars per barrel, or the rife
- of the Orleans market 'for three months,
1 he might have it. The commandant re
" turned for answer, that the flour was there,
and he mujl and would have it ; and with
"l refpett to the price, he (Mr. M'Cluney)
e must fettle that with the proper officers at
New" Orleans, and immediately sent down
some soldiers to seize the boat, in direst
violation of the 7th article of the treaty,
n which declares that " the fubje<fts or citi
- zens of eaeh of the contracting parties,
U their vessels or effefts, shall not be liable to
any embargo or detention on the part of
h the other, for any military expedition, or
fe other public or private purpose whatever."
is When he came to New Orleans, he procur
ft ed certificates from the; different merchants,
ir of the price of flour, being 14 dollars per
If barf el, ar.d he presented these to the proper
h officers, expelling to receive that sum ; but
ill what was his 'surprise, when, contrary to
t. every principle of honor and honelty, and
jf ; in open violation of a foltmn treaty, he
g j found they would only give him 12 .dollars !!
le I In vain did he remonllrate on the occasion ;
b- ! in vain did he plead the treaty, or his being
I an American citizen ! He difcoveved too
.1- late, that the common principles of redti
n- tude were not to be found in the bosom of
- 1 a Spaniard ; and all.the fatisfadion he had
s, (if a fatisf.ftion it may be called) was,
ty that lie was not the only one, by many, who
re had been dnped in the fame manner.
ft j The other cafe refpedkd aiyfelf; one
Jofi-ph Vidal, the (v'eretary of the govern- h
Wnt was indebted to me a fjim of money, 1
of which when I wfint to demand- the pay- if
ment, he tendered me as a discharge some
Spanilh certificates, which bore an enormous ii
discount, there being no money at that time d
in the treasury,âthese certificates are a si
species of paper money drawn by the com- a
mandants of the different forts on the treafu- Â«
ry at New Orleans, and paid away to work- 1<
men, &c. for wages; and are received by ti
the merchants at a rate proportionable to V
the degree of confidence they can put in p
them. Vidal wanted me to receive them at a
their nominal, vjilueâl refufed, and as he r
would not pay me in the current coin of the e
country, I brought the cafe before Gayofo "
the governor. He (who has so Â»ften as- v
fured Mr. Ellicott that it is the fmcere wi(h h
of Spain to carry the treaty into effeft) â d
this fame man decreed (contrary to the F
knowledge of every inhabitant of the place) c
that it was the cujlom of that country to re
ceive the certificates as ca(h, and that (even r
depreciated as they were) they were a legal c
tender. I reded myfelf on the treaty, and F
begged that agreeable to the provision made '
in the 7th article the cafe might be decided '
according to the authority of LAW ON
LY, 'and not according to the cujlom of the
country, with wflSch, as aft ringer, I was ]
not supposed be acquainted, and further, J
that the law ( if there were would 1
affeft the cafe in point), might be pointed
out to me ; on which OUR FRIEND 1
GAYOSO, pointing to his own breast, had 1
the effrontery to tell me, that HE was the (
law ; and that as HE said, the law was to '
be decided. As the governor had none but '
his own sycophants about him when he made 1
use of this assertion, I thought it necessary
to call in some one to be witness to so extra- 1
ordinary a declaration ; and as an authority
for so doing, I pleaded the 7th art. of the
treaty, Which declares, that " The citizens
and fubjt?As oflioth parties (hall be allowed 1
to employ such advocates,' solicitors, nota- 1
ries, agents, and faftors, as they may judge 1
proper in all their affairs, and in all their tri- 1
als at law, in whiqh they may be concerned
before the tribunals of the other party ; and
such aagiits (hall have free access to be pre
sent at tne proceedings in such causes, and at
the taking of all examination and evidence
which may be exhibited in the said trials."
But even thisâthis very evident privilege
was refufed by the fame evasive answers, and
every avenue to obtain justice completely
1 (hut up. Fym these circumstances it is
. evident.there is no greater security in navi
. gating the Miffiflippi, since the treaty than
. before it; nor will. there ever be, till that
[ nest of harpies, who prey upon the Ameri
. can citizens, is completely rooted out:â
what dependance can be placed in a treaty,
which the whim or caprice, favor or folly,
1 of a petty commandant of a Spanilh garrison
, is able to set aside : and to substitute hit own
will as the Uw which is to govern a free ci
. tizen, rilking his property under the faith
1 of foleron treaties.
Rcprefentations of these two cases have
j been forwarded to the secretary of state.

er The Journal des Hommes Libres, which
lit is commonly pretty well acquainted with the
to secrets of the Louvre, because it is under the
id dre&ion of some of the subaltern gentry
:ie there, discovers great regret at the symptoms
! J of reconciliation between the council and the
1 ; direftory. Carnot and conciliation are the
,g objefts of its most violent indignation ; it
jo regrets that the chance of a civil war is
ti- gone. The following are its refleftions :
of " The ganeral efforts of the political le
ad vers, which for these some days have been

he) in order to advance with more effeft.â t
The general.chorus is, "I am afraid, and I vv

It then proceeds to (late*, that the plan of j ei
impeachment against the direftory is aban- I
doned ; and that the direftory has on its ; f<
fide abandoned the idea of an impaachment '
against a part of the legidative body. It
regrets that the clubs have been al

that those it calls patriots will be massacred ,
ever ; that they will' thus he It
punished for their incorrigible confidence f;
and their foolifh simplicity ; that without a , b
rupture, the peace at Lisle will be conclud- ' tl

impeachment of the Direftory and a civil f;
war will come a little later ; that the legif- ; p

A few day 3 ago, Buonaparte's harrangue <
to the army of Italy was polled against all !
the walls of Paris. At the present moment 1
the walls are covered with an eloquent ad- 1
dress of Pichegrue to the armies. It is ex- 1
trafted from the report madtS-by him in the ]

I am inclined to think too, that the public
tranquillity is not so much in danger at some
people imagine from the effefts produced
by the present fermentation in the public
mind, and the struggle that has taken place
too indulgent. The good understanding
of governors frequently proceeds from noth
ing more than a cordial adoption of a system
of usurpation. A little animosity makes
them keep a watchful eye on their conduft,
and their mutual faults. Dispositions, there
fore, of this kind, so far from being injuri
ous to the governed, are generally beneficial
to them. It is only desirable, in order that
no bad effefts may arise, that the parties be
fufficiently strong to check themselves, with
out any (hoek, merely by the equilibrium to
be produced by collision. This appears to
â me to be the secret of our present situation.
The constitution is a centre which draws all
around itâThe debates tend to its establish
ment. This ought to be their objeft, and
resistance serves only to add force to their
endeavours.

ADMINISTRATION OF FINANCES.

i enemies of the country. I entreat yt>u, ci
- tizeu commiflioner, to demand of .the cen
s tral administration of the department, to
1 tranferibe on its regiftcrs the copy of this
letter, to the end that your fellow-citizens
may be made acquainted with it, and that it
- may manifeft, by its publicity, the intentions
J of the government, on who ft efforts and
: perseverance every stress may be laid. I
: Aiould be afraid of weakening the impreflion
â  which an exposition of the principles by
, which the. direftory is aftuatad, onght to
. make on every citizen, if I were to enter in
to any elucidations of my own. It rather
becomes me to confine myfelf to the pressing
f exhortation and formal recommendation I
3 now make to you, to employ all the means
, in your power to. re-animate public confU
- deuce, to prove that it is established on the
t most solid basis, to point out all those who
s aim at weakening it, to apply to them the
- laws enafted against the enemies of the
country, and to communicate to me all the
fafts which may come to your knowledge.
, If any purchaser of a national domain (hould
: be molested in the enjoyment of his property,
1 denounce the author of the outrage to the
- tribunals, and apprise me without delay of

The letter* that we receive from the de* j
partments speak only of the contradictory
orders given for the march of the troops.
If a courier in the morning brings an order
to advance, another in the evening brings an
order to retreat. The general officers cross
each other, and nothing seems to be thought
of but bringing the two councils to their
reason. This is a light iketch of' the pro
ceeding that take place in our frontier de
partments, and which resemble too much
those that preceded the revolution of 1790.
How is it that a government newly establish
ed, so much refemblea that which we are
destroying ? .
It is said, indeed, thit general Ferine,
at Sedan, has flopped the march of two
columns of our army that were going to
Paris. He obferred to them that their
marching orders were not legal, and they
retreated. It is, however, added, that he
was obliged to make preparations for op
posing their passage, and that the cannon
of the citadel was turned against them.â

The ftriking-.proof of animosity displayed
by the opposite parties in the fitting of the
Council of Five Hundred of the 20th inft.
appear to have spread fame alar/n among the
friends' of the present coiiftitution of France.
All the public prints demoted to the party
of the moderates, are filled with the most af
fedting complaints, and the strongest appre
hensions on the occasion of this unexpected
division. L'Eclair eXpresses himfelf ip the
following manner 011 this interesting fubjedt:
" The cdfis approaches : all the symp
toms of a new revolution already begin to
appear, uiegiarties are already raisged up in
battle array again ft each other. Yet a few
days, and the sword will decide. Discord
has taken ppfTeffion of the Council of Five
Hundred, and it will not be cast cjut till it
has gorged itfelf with the blood of the one
party or the other ; perhaps of both.
" Woe be to him," said a sage, " Woe
he to him thro whom offence cometh!" Woe
be to you, Reprefcntatives of the People,
when, degrading the ituguft charaÂ£ter with
which you are inverted, yort transform your
Senate to an arena for Gladiators ! Can
you hope that men will refpeft you when
you do not refpedt Vourfelves ? And how do
you hope to govern, if you do not inipire
refpett ?
" Which party is to blame ? Both. I
will fay this, however, that if violence can
St all be pardoned it is iu the vanished mino
rity. But you, the favorite Representatives
of the People ; you, of whom a united ma
jority is always sure to triumph, how can
such excuses be juftifisd in you ? What evil
geuitis could inspire von with the fatal tho't
of terminat ing by the spirit of faction, a dif
cufiion in which you were sure to be victo
rious, by displaying with calmness and with
dignity the whole power of your will ?
" Cybeas, on entering the Roman Senate,
imagined himfelf tranfportedinto an afTembly
of Kings : What would he have faid,had he
been a fpeftator of such indecent contests ?
And, great God ! at what a moment do
you rellgn yourfelf to the impulse of your
brutal paflions ? At the moment when the
envoys of the King of England arrive to
treat for'peaee ! Do you believe that scenes
of this nature are very well calculated to in
spire them with a high confidence in the
wisdom and in the liability of our govern
ment ?'
" If you overthrow, or if you allow the
Constitutional Republic to be overthrown,
you will fall into the military Republic, and
the latter will be more dreadful than the
former. To day you are magistrates ; to
morrow you will be slaves. Amicus Plato
magis arnica Veritas. Never was there a fay
ing more necefiary to be repeated jpd ob
served.
" On what'points then does the crisis in
which France is-placed, depend at this mo-,
ment! On the retaining or difmifTal of four
ministers, whom the majority of both coun
cils, and the whole nation accuse of igno
rance and perfidy, and whom the Diredtory
obstinately persists in preserving as the agents
of the Executive Power." On this fubjedt
of ditutiion we meet with the following re
marks in the fame' Journal :
" In every country that wiflies to preserve
its tranquility and happioefs, the ablest and
wisest men- should be called to the manage
ment of public affairs. Confidence is extin
guished in every heart when folly and igno
rance obftruft the avenues tp the feat of gov
ernment. Cease then, Directors, to shut
your ears to our prayers ! VVe entreat you,
in the name of your country, to dismiss
from their employments, and banish from
your presence, Ramel, Charles La Croix,
Truguet, and Merlin. The last is peculiar
ly unworthy, your notice. As longasyou
remain surrounded by such ministers, how
can you pofiibly exjÂ» (ft, that we, who are
both by good will and reason firmly bound
to support the prefefltorderof things, should
protest you against the and com
plaints of those, who, regretting what thejf
have loft, eagerly desire to return to that
point from which they firft set out ? Were
we to be your adyocates, should we not ex
pose ourfelvesto thejuft reproaches of either
flattering stupidity, or of being the accom
plices of wicked men ? We makethis request
on your as well as our own account. When
you shall have granted it, we will then en
deavour to recal to reason those of our bre
thren who are now tormented with unavail
ing anxiety."

r e The conllru&or, having exttnded to his
it fellow-citizens, all reasonable gratification of
[e f their laudable curiosity, during the progress
of the buildmg, believes he may with pro
â te priety make the following request and fug.
Ie geflions, on the operation of launching the
frigate Conjlitution.
h That (excepting the I'refideut of the U
r nited States, the Governor, Lieutenant Go
n vernor, and their refpedtive suites, and o
n thers specially admitted, who will compara
-0 tively, be very few) no person will attempt
e in any way, to pass into the limits of the
navy yard.
J The reason of this reqfieft is obviously to i
r, ; prevent interrupfion or confufion which might i
be injurious or ruinous to the aÂ£t of launch- -1
s ing ; which will be critical, under the molt :
. favorable circumstances, and indispensably re- i
n quiring perfect silence and obedience to or- 1
1 ders. Independent of this conclusive reason, i
t the danger of encroaching fpe&ators would |
be imminent from the occasional and abrupt I
. falling of bodies used in the conftrudtion of (
l the ship ; a conformity therefore to this re- 1
quest, is earnestly solicited. i
, ' Itl9 . fu g?efted, as the tide will be full, t
f that it wojild be necefiary to the fafety of \
the fpedtators, particularly women and chil- <
> dren, that they do not approach in crouds I
j too near the margin of the contiguous
r wharves, as the sudden entrance of so large
. a body as the frigate, will occasion an inftan
> taneousfwell of the water the height of which ;
i cannot be easily calculated,and again (I which, n
. therefore, the discretion of the people ought v
. amply to guard,
It is regretted, in this instance, that the c
yard and the places around it, are too con- y
. traded for an occasion which will probably ii
) excite so much desire, and in which all the
[ citizens have so much interest ; it is there
f fore submitted to those who can make th* b
. arrangement, to place themselves in vessels, a
, or water crafts, at due distance, upon the pro- h
. file or fide of the Frigate, but by no means p
too near, either in a right line or otherwise, a
as the direction may be uncertain, nor to load
i open boats too deeply, as the agitation of
. the water even at a considerable distance,
may be somewhat hazard us.
It is also recommended to those who eredt c
. stages to accommodate fpedtators, that they o
have them secured in every refpedt, as the J
! lofsoflife of a single citizen, would mar the lj
fatisfadtion and pleasure that the conftrudtOr
. etherwife would enjoy, of building and con- si
dudting into the ocean, z powerful agent of u
. national justice, which hope didtates may be- t(
come the just pride and ornament of the A- fj
merican name. c '

ItATISBON, July 20. '* ha:
There appears reason to apprehend the Hi
molt violent discussions in the Diet here, on ma
the fubjedt <>f the articles of peace conelud- bu
ed between the emperor and the French re- tin
public. From the moment of signing the Svi
preliminaries, the emperor has kept the W
most profound iilence as to "their contents ; int
! the French "announced that their republic nol
was acknowledged in all its integrity, which tea
J gave the greatest uneasiness to the princes we
j and states, whose territory had been declar- W
;ed an integral part of the French republic, al
; It was only 011 the 22d of June tha% the th(
1 imperial cabinet notified to the diet that oni
â¢ the preliminaries had been signed, an event ly
j which took place at Leobeii, on the 18th be.
â  April. The form of this imperial decree, Di
1 the equivocal expreflions which are contain- vvh
jcd in ic, and a certain tone of eoibarrafT- cili
' tnent which prevails througTioirt It, were
d not vary well calculated to raise the spirits
r of men.* The bishop of Liege, among
>. others, having applied t!> his imperial ma
h jelly to know, whether after the-concfufron
of the peace he should enter into the pot
r feffiori of his bilhoprick, received the sol
- lowing laconic and at the fame time Jcfiiti
- cal reply ; << That the integrity of the
e empire had been adopted as the basis of the
', treaty of peace to be concluded between
!- France and the empire.'' This answer,
e which to short-sighted men may appear fa
s tisfa&ory, only served to increase the uitea
s finefs of those who look forward' at alriy
0 diflanee.
Add to this, the good undcrflanding
f which prevails between the court of Vienna
f and the French government, and the fecu
-1 rity of the latter as to the possession nf its
- new department. The following incident
f is however deserving of attention :âSeve
- ral dates of the empire have officially an
nounced to the diet, that the German bo
i dy, fully confident of the wifdam and mag
nanimity of their chief head, entreats him
to accept an absolute authority to conclude
a peace. We are aflurfd that the ecclesi
astical prince who brought forward this at
the dfet, afied sincerely, but was betrayed
3 into the measure by others more artful than
f himfelf, whose reasoning was this : "If
3 the emperor has really obtained a stipulation
- for the integrity of the empire, he will ac
cept the offer with great readiness, as it
: will add to the glory of the house of Au
stria, but if not he will rejeft it." This
- very circumstance has caused the tmperor
to express himfelf diflatisfied with one of
his commiflioners, who supported the pro
position.
Ihe solution of the enigma is now whif
â¢ peredânotwiftanding tl\e pafiVge in the im
perial decree, which secures ihe integrity
' of the empire, the imperious force of cii
cumftances renders it neceflary to construe
â  - this sentence as applying to the constitution,
and not to the territory of the empire, and
it is with reason apprehended, that some of
â  the prelacies wilLbe secularized. This will
, necefTarily produce complaints in the diet,-
I Ind protests on the part of the injured
â  itates; but it will not be difficult for the
emperor's, ministers to juftify their mailer,
by shewing what he his done, as his /hare
in this dreadful war, and, by appealing to
the princes and dates individually, to know
whtther each of them has done all |J)at he
â  could, and that he ought to have done, on
his part.

ROME, July 7.
The agitation here, as well as in the other
parts of the estates of the church, conti
nues to be very great f The pope yesterday
went from the Vatican to the Quirinal Pa
lace, without acclamation and without
croud. He may yet survive his illness some
years, and the people are not deftrous of
innovation.
A letter is in circulation here, written
by gefferal Buonaparte to cardinal Mattci,
at Terrara, in which the general fays, that
he is daily invited to Rome to the peo
ple there better laws, and a constitution
more agreeable to the rights of man.
BRUSSELS, Jnly 31.
The following are the most certain ac
counts of the marches and countermarches
of the troops of the army of the Sambre and
Meufe towards the interior of the Repub
lic.
Some days ago an order arrived for cau
sing all the troops, as well as the artillery
who had pafTcdtheancient frontiers ofFrance
to retreat. Several corps began according
ly to retreat, but on tha 27th of July there
came very prefling orders from" Paris, for all
the troops to march into the interior of the
Republic. A column which had come from
Charleroi.to Namur, set off without reding,
for Givet apd all the troops in the 'neigh
bourhood and* the Park of artillery set off
on the fame night for the interior.
It may be asked why these troops, who
are said to be destined for a maritime expe
dition, carry with them such a quantity of
artillery and warlike stores? why they are
accompanied by flying artillery, by four re
giments of horse chasseurs, by dragoons and
by hussars? Without answering all these
important queflions, we can only fay, as a
certain fadl, that attempts are made to ex
cite the troops against part of the Legisla
tive Body. Wherever the detachments of
the army of the Sambre and Meufe have pas
sed, they have (hewn the mod dreadful want
of discipline, pillaging their hods, ill ufu-
I ing them, and when the latter complained,
stigmatizing them with the names of Chou
ans and Royalids. (
They write from Mavy, that the Munici- i
pal Adminidration of the Canton of Ballon 1
has caused it to be proclaimed by found of !
drum, that all the Citizens (hall declare in (
writing the Religion which they refufe to (
profefs. " <
BASLE, Jilly 25.
\ ' a
We are assured that Gtneral Buonaparte a
has tedified discontent at the refufal of the t
Helvetic Body relative to the passage de- 1
mawded through the Valais. It is even said c
but that wants confirmation, that tie has in- J,
timated a resolution to force this passage, if 0
Switzerland (hall not consent to grant it. '*
We know not why this General is so much *'
intereded about this passage, which Would
not be very ufeful to his army, and why he a
teazes the Swiss so much to obtain it; for a
we can hardly believe, as the friends of Mr. F
Wickham would insinuate, that the Goner
al is desirous of a pretence to intermeddle in a
the affairs of Switzerland, and to revoluti- j.
onize some Cantons, who are not very friend- n
ly to popular tumults. However that may
be, the Swiss confide in the promise of the a
Directory, and in the vifdora of Bsrthelemy c
who so well possesses the rare talent of con- 5
ciliating inlte d of esafpetating. 1,

A Hint to the Citizens of Philadelphia.
THIS day, about two o'clock in the af
ternoon, a fire was discovered to be burning
in a large quantity of shingles, in Mr. Stog
den's board yard, a little above Callowhill
dreet, in the Nothern Liberties. It being
seen by the fmoak, as soon as it began to
burn, by the alertness of the inhabitants it!
was soon extinguished. Matches were found i
which it had been kindled with, and brought i
to my office. There is no doubt with me, 1
but it was done to set Are to the neighbour- 1
hood, as one half of the people are moved
out of it.

September, 21.
Tie following is tie notice taken iy Bachc a parsgrafb
in ll r tdnefJa\ t Gazette.
" To ije an objei* of the abuse of an hireling
tvretdjy capable of iuch. sentiments as the foreg*>inu
difclofcj, i# an honor to a republican ; w* fliali j
therefore always fee happy when Fenno ihall pleafc ;
to favor us with a portion of his billingsgate. But 1
the abenre paragraph d i'erves to be conficUrcd in j
another view. John Fcnno's preft is patronised by |
this jfov.ernment ; he is the printer for one of the ,
highest branch# of it,âthe Senate : Will it npt !
be considered then, that he speaks their sentiments; â¢
and, if so, vhp.t are we to e*peÂ£l from France, j
ihould a counter-revolution and the
ment of Royalty toot take ptecc. Publications such
as the foregoing, arc well calculated to rcurifh the
4ifquietode wliic #xirts between this country and
France, and to leidto a rupture ; they are no doubr,
therefore, ivell paid for, âby Mr. Ljston. We
mcution this consideration in exculpation of our
jjovemmcu; (whom we do not think capable of (
p/jompting luch diabolical ientimCMs) that the true
source of them may be ufiderftood abroad, to be
Entifh, and not to come from our executive admin- 1
illration, who by th.ir countenance of Fenno's 1
press might appear implicated." F
It is, to be sure, little better than wafting time *
and room to notice such paltry jargon : But one r
ca.inot refrain from contempt at feeing this black c
guar.l, affe<ft to set i-p for the " exculpator" of a gov- c
ernmsnt, which he makes it the \vh6le business of r
his life to weaken, defame 8c destroy. A very great 1<
degres of irvconfillency and puerility, f
are prime r<?quiGtes in the charader of a Ja-obii-.
This pooh, filly, emaciated dupe of French villainy, ii
fuems to think, that to repel an accusation, it is on- ft
lyrcccfTary to retort it. It appears never to have p
entered into his addled brain, that a difference of a;
circumstances makes a between ca- ft

continue that 'attachment under the immenle '
change which has since taken place j an-1 not only
to continue {imply the attachment, but, vigorously J. 3

erated to downright piracy, robbery, and murder,

atrocities, too ; under thtfe circumstances, 1 fay. Tv
the man who can have the hardihood to encounter
the indignation of all his fellow-citizens, and the th

CAUTION. \
WHEREAS a combination of men in this ,
county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m- t
felves,by fabricating titles to fundi / valuable trads I
of land, the'property of gentlemen living in New j c
Yoik, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for Which 1 <
of hnd large funis of money have been paid 1 1
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers 1
It is therefore just thit public information lhould 'â¢
be given, to-the end, that the injured may seek re- '
drel'j while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have bean discovered are Tru
tnan Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several otheri who go under fiflitions names. It Is
supposed that the lands offered fcr faleon-thofe fa- ,
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand 1
dollars. Such as we have aiftual knowledge of are |
as follows : Lots No. II and IZ, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the aiiual property ot William j
Delhlv)!!, row of London ; lots No. 58 and 64, j
fame patent, thousand acres each, the prrperty of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and lames Avenll
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management. â1 he Printers will do well to give
. this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing tHose lands, as also to de- j
' prive those men M future from imposing on indivi
dual, which their education and addrels have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a shopkeeper of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will'fct in a clear point
of view the wickedness of those men, which whsn
tlje public have perused, will induee them to ex
cuse the'interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfcgo, July 48th, * 7>7.
1 Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
â ing been led into-in error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to figii a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, O'fcgo patent, which
was the property of William 1 Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others imd further the said Joieph
and Truman did pcrfuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out 011 the icth day
of November, 1793, or set hack two ycats so as
_ to bring it' to that time ; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious nam.',
> there being no focli perlon there. To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.

of sand aÂ«*rÂ«s of land in the Otego patent, and pro
'C mifed this deponent a (hare of tlie profits, on the
>e sale of said lands, for his so doing ; and th .t they
I. madeapplicationfeveral times for the feme purpole,
1- which iVrvicts this deponent as often refufed, de
le daring to them that he had no right t,o lands, and
f- could do no such thing ; which daring attempt 011
