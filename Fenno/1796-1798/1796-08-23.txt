" And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and
/aid, Let me, J pray thee, lift my fathfr atd mo
tber, and then / will fallow thee.
IN the reign of King Ahab, Elijah, the Tifh
bite, and the prophet, possessed a power, little short
of the regal. Saintly, charitable, wife, and prrfci
ent, he gained the affections, and suggested the
plant, 'of the Israelites. At that period, popular
belief was ftrongljr attached to prophecy, and po
pular applause surely would not only be acquired,
but merited by him, whose life waÂ» given to all the
<3utittt of benevolence. It seemÂ«, that Elijah had
the strongest claims upon the attention, the grati
tude, and respeCt of his fellow-citizens. As a man,
as a prophet, he had filled up the measure of ufe
fnlnefs. The Zidonians, though proverbially " care
less and secure," had felt the cbaflifement .of the
ikies, which retained their dew, and their rain, and
the dusty and parched region, attefled the drought
of years. Among this supine race, the observing
prophet,-had recognized an individual, a wornjn of
Zarephath, " Looking well to the ways of' her
household," and providing food for her little son,
by the common calamity. Her signal
display of charity, at a time, when felfifhnefs would
aver, that charity itfelf must fail, induced the grate
ful Elijah to invoke miracles to her aid. The bar
rel and the cruse, which hunger had emptied, were
perennially supplied, and the darling child of the
widow, was reanimated, by the prayer of the pro
phet. Nor was this the only pafiage in his life, to
excite the wonder, or fecute the veneration, of his
people. HÂ« had, r.rft by ridicule, aÂ»d then by ex
periment, confounded the wotfhip of Baal, and ref
tdred the religion of she Jews. From that " little
cloud," which a servant could not, during seven at
tempts, behold and which at length, seemed mi
nutely rising from the sea, " like a man's hand,"
the enlightened eyes of Elijah could discern torrents
defcendingto "water, and revive the parched grounds
of paoiiyia, F.xnoOfj. to jibe iÂ£--IÂ»^cheL
a vindictive and powerful prineefs, the fugitive pro
phet seemed to be the peculiar care of Providtnce.
Ready to perish, under the scanty shade of the
mournful juniper, food was supplied bim by ange- :
licH hands, and a celestial voice vindicated to the
repining seer, the ways Â«f heaven.
This enumeration of the peculiarities of Elijah's
life and office, will not be deemed impertinent, by
those who, with the Preacher, trace the context,
and find the prophet by the fide of the yauthful
Â»fha. To him the reputation of the sage was
orious. He had heard his prophecies, he had
â¢ritneffed their completion. He saw the venerable
philosopher, inverted with the double power to
anoint a Syriack king, and a Jewish prophet. He
mufl havei conjeCtured, that the mysterious mantle
of his predeceflor, would soon secure to Elifha an
Elijah's praise. What powerful incitements to the
pride, to the ambition of a young and oblcure man.
How would an ordinary, how would a felfifh cha
racter have been engtoffed by vain speculations.
" How great, how wife, hov,' courted," he might
whisper, " shall 1 be, about to possess the faculties
of a pfophet, whose fame has been resounded
through Palfftine, andwhofe mighty works ajjgj?
mon.candidate for such an office, would have forgot
ten his connexions, his country, his duty, every
thing, but bimfelf. But Elifha was not fotiazzled
by the blaze of a prophet's glory, as to become be
wildered in the paths of duty. He remembered
the injunction from Mount Sinai, to honor the
more immediate authors of our being. He reflec
ted th3t his Parents ought t-o be apprised of the
new dignity of their son ; they would rejoice at his
prospeCts, they would shed their benediction. In-
Head, therefore, of instant compliance, the dutiful
EHfha pauses, refieft upon his beloved home, and
the aged couple at its fire fide, and makes the affec
tionate response in the text, " Let me-, I pray thee,
iifs my father and my mother, and then J will follow
thee.--Verily, Elifha, thou proved a good fort, -and
I love thee moie, $or iememberi-;g a Mother I '/-love,
than for all thy miracles. They may pass away,
but not one jot, nor one tittle of thy filial piety
(hall pass from remembrance. Divided Jordan, a
sweetened spring, and a miraculous gush of waters,
might own thy energy, but thy tender concern of
thy Parents, revealed thy heart. When hearing
thy pathetick tequeft, Let me lift my father aid
mother, the Cherub charities of life drew near, and
weptâand smiled !
The duty implied in the text, is acknowledged
by all, but I fear is felt, except by few. The ha
bit of domeftieiting with parents, during our in
fancy and childhood, induces a mechanical affecti
on, and an obedience of eourfe. But when the
calls of bofinefs urge us from home, the world ope
rates as an opiate, and benumbs every filial fenfati
on. We leave.it to the nurse to talk of the cradle,
and the endearments of a mother* and to the ftew
frd to compute the sums ihat a father's indulgence
has given, without reflecting upon the gentle offi
ces of the one parent, or the bounty of the other.
But reflection will convince any man that, general
ly speaking, he never fouud falter friends, than his
parents. Mutual interefl, natural affeCtion, and
long habit, all ft em to conspire to bind parents and
progeny in the union. Nor is it a small debt
we owe to them for twenty one years service. LifI*,1*,
its means, and Education, these are the important
items of their accompts against us, and /hail we
carefefsly forget the obligation :
When'cbildren are in their full (Irength, parents
are commonly advanced in age. " Age hath pains
to footb," and who so proper to practice " lenient
arts, make languor smile, and smooth the bed of
â¢ death," as a daaghter, or a son ? What fervicc i
cote grateful, whftduty more clear i
The amiable son of Sirach knew this truth i
well. I can add nothing to his fanftion, his ener
gy, or his tendernefc. " He that honoreth his
mother, is as one that layeth up treafarcâand the
relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten. In
the day of affliction it shall be remembered ; thy
fins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm
weather, ' >

PIACENZA, May 31. [
On the 26th inft. the French made a general at-
tack upon Beaulieu's army which extended from
Verona to Rovevedo and confided of no more than
14,000 men, infantry, cavalry and the late rein
forcements from Germany included ; they repulsed
the Aullrian light-horse and compelled Beaulieu to
rttrfat.
It is therefore believed that the Auftrians crossed i
the Adige and took the road to Trent. They 1
eould consequently not fall in with the corps of a- <
bout 30,000 Republicans of General Kellerman's '
army which passed through Brescia and filing along
the lake Di Garda advanced through Valteline in
order to reach the road of Rovetedo and cut off the
retreat of Beaulieu.
It is supposed that Mantua was invested after this <
battle. The garrifim of that place does not amount '
to more than 7000 men, which could not find time
to join Bea'ulieu's aimy after his defeat.
General Rofelmini commands the troops in the
fortrefs and the General of Engineers Orlandim
dire&s the artillery. The fortreis is provided with
amnHunition and above three hundred pieces of ar
tillery, but provisions are very scarce. Before the
place was blocked up the inhabilants sent to Ferra
ra for a lupply of provisions; but the papal legate
in that city prohibited immediately the exportation.
BOLOGNA, MÂ»y3Â«-
The Cardinal Archbilhop of this eity. has ad
dressed a circular letter -to all the mDnafteries, con
vents, panfhes, Sec, by which he, being authorised
theieto by the Pope, ordains and commands, that
all the ehutch plate, gold and silver vases not indif
penflbly necessary (hall be weighed and kept ready,
for the u(e of the state.
The Arehbifhop exhorts the superiors, Sec. of
the monasteries, convents, parilhes, See. to be faith
ful and punctual in fending within siva days, the
demanded fpecification of all the plate, gold and
silver vases exiftmg in their refpeftive houses.
The prelates observe here: We ought to re
aiembcr that are citizens all and every one of
us. We ought therefore all to partake of the bur
den which divine justice choofcs to inflict upon 11s.
He concludes by assuring them that no more of the
plate than is indifpenfibly necessary, (hall be taken,
r;d that the state obliges itfelf to pay to the re-
churches the annual interest proportionate
to the intrinftcal value of the plate. This circular
letter is dated May a3, and signed by, D. A. Car.
Gienetti, Archbifhep and Apoftolicai Legate.
