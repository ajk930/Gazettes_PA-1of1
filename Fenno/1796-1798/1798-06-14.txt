HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, May 23.
The bill for regulating the compensation of
Marshals, Attorneys, Jurors and Witnelfes;
and the bill for relief of William Simmons,
Accountantof the War Department, were read
1 the third time and palled.
> The bill refpefiing Alien Enemies wasread
" the third time, when
> Mr. R. Wii.i.iams moved a reccunmit
- ment of the bill. He said his objections did
not lie so much against the provisions resett
ing Aliens, as to the powers proposed to be
given to the Preliiient ofiffuing proclamati
ons, which are to be binding on the Judges
and other Officers, with refpeft to our own
citizens. He should wish to designate every
offence and its adequate punilhment, as far
as it could be done. In orderto effeÂ£t this, he
made {lis m*tion.
Mr. Sewa li, said, so much difcufiion took
1 place on this fubjeit yesterday, that he did
not expect any more to day. The gentleman
i from N. Carolina seemed not to object to the
â¢ powers given to the President by the firft and
1 second lections of the bill, but h? did not wish
â¢ him to have any Officers to execute his pow
r ers. If the President could carry the law into
effect with his own hand, he might do it j'but
he objefted to his having any aid from his
Officers or the people at large. He did not
believe this kind of reasoning could have any
effttft in this house. If the Prelident is au
: thorifed to issue orders, he mutt be authori
sed to require the aid of properperfons to exe
cute them.
Mr. Gallatin called the Yeas and Nays
upon this question ; which being agreed to be
taken,
Mr. G. hoped this bill Would be recommit, j
ted. He had no doubt that the committee, by ;
paying due attention to thefubjeit, infteadof I
this general and vague bill, might report such 1
rules and regulation? as would be proper to i
be adoptedonthisoccafion. Herecolleftedfee-j
ing a bill from the Senate 011 the fubjeit, in 1
which something of this kind was done ; and I
â  though he did by no means approve of that
bill, yet it fliewed that the thing was not jm
podible. The objection made again(t a re
committal of this bill, was that it was neces
sary to do something to provide means for se
curing and removing Alien Enemies, which
did not apply as an argument against the re
commitment of the bill. It was a good reason
why a bill should bo passed, but no reason
why it fhonld pass in its present form. The
present bill, Mr. G. said, was grounded uoon
the principle that the President of the United
States (hall have the power to do by Procla
mation, what ought only to be done by law.
In the firft place, the Proclamation of the
President is to determine the period when
foreigners not naturalized, Avail be liable to
be apprehended, retrained, secured and re
moved as alien enemies. Mr. G. underfteod
what was meiht by apprehending alien ene
mies, and securing them, but he did not un
*<?erftand the word " retraining,it was vague,
he said, in its hature, and he did not know
that it was a legal phrase. The committee
could themselves exptain it. By the bill from
the Senate, it was intended to confine them
within the place where they resideâperhaps
this was their idea. The bill goes further,
they are not only liable to be apprehended,
restrained, secured and removed, but " to be
fu'bjeft, with their goods and effects, to ajuft
retaliation of any unusual severities, reffraints
and confil'cations, which shall be fuffered by
the citizens of the United States, resident
within the territory of the hostile nation or go
vernment, and inflicted by their authority.
Mr. G. wifhedto have explained what was
meant by " unusual feverifes." They must 1
mean something more than confifcations, than
apprehending, retraining or removing, be
cause they are fpecifically provided for. He
wifiied, therefore, to know what these unusu
al severities were, which upon our own ideas
of Government, we could retaliate i If any
other severities besides those which are here
enumerated, wereto be inflicted upon ourciti
zens in France, he tho't it would be difgraceful
to that country,&hecould not believe that ei
therproprietyorjultics, would warrant us com
mitting a difgraceful aCt against the citizens
of another Nation, bicaufe that Nation had
committed a difgraceful aCt upon our citizens
in their country,
Mr. Se wall rose to explain, but the Spea
ker said, the rule which declares no member
shall fpeakmore than once to a question would
not permit him.
Mr. G. did not know whether these words
" unusual severities," were not intended to
be held in terrorehiover the conduCt of France.
If so, lie did not think it a very creditable
proceeding. But he believed that part of the
bill perfectly useless, for two reasons. First,
it is extremely doubtful w hethcr the Presi
dent of the United Statescould confhtutional
ly exercise those "unusual severities," which
this bill fays he may exercise ; and with re
speCt to confiscation it was explained by a
subsequent part ot the bill to be only afequef
tration till the next session of Congress, and he
therefore conceived this partof the bill to be
of no life, except to (tain our code of law, in a
mannsr expressly contrary to the spirit of our
Constitution, which declares no " crtielor
unusual punishments," shall be inflicted.
But supposing the words only held out in
terrorem, he wiflied to know how they would
apply, whether it was to make a part of our
permanent law, or whether it is suited for the
present time only. If it were not to make a
part of our permanent system, and he thought
ns gentleman would fay it ought, thenit must
be 011 account of our present situation. As to
our present situation, in relation to anything
which may befal our citizens in France, he
would fay the words are useless, and this fÂ»r
a plain reason ; for, out of the natives of
France in this country, ninety nine out of an
hundred, are of that description of persons
Whom the French call Emigrants, and it is
therefore perfectly immaterial to the Fiench
Nation how they are treated ; fothat the bill
could operate only on a dozen or two of per
sons of a different description who may be in
this country.
In the next place, with refpeit to confisca
tion, which by the next clause are so limited ,
as to become sequestrations, it would be wrong
to give this power to the President. Anarti- r ,
cle is inserted in the British treaty expressly
to declare, that sequestrations are impolitic
and imjnft in every cafe, and providing against
them. He admitted that it might be ireceffary
to resort to them on some occufions, becaule r
By John Fenno, NÂ°- 119 Cbejnut Street.
lie believed there might be cases where fctjiief
tration would be necelfary by way of 'indem
nification ; but what he iiilifled upon was,
. that it ought to be done by law, and not by
the President. Ob a former occasion, when '
the question of Sequestration was before Con- j
f _grefs, the power was not proposed to be left I
; at large witli the Prtfidenf, but was to be re
i â  gulated by law.
J There was another cirenmflance which
fhevved how easy a thing it would be.to pass a
i law themselves, inrtead of leaving every re
filiation relative to this fubjett with the Pre- 1
. fident. About the middle of the second fee- 1
1 tion, it is said, " where no treaty exifls, a rea
. fonable time (hall be allowed, which shall be I
; ascertained and declared by the Prfefident, or \
. by the Coagrefs of the United States." This (
s was a kind of double legislation which was I
! new to hiip. He wished to know what diffi- 1
f culty there would have been in definjng the 1
r time here referred to, in this bill > It appear
: ed to him the right and the proper tiin'fe to do t
it. From the moment fhat the resolution came j
c before the house, he was ready to acknov/- t
i ledge that the power of regulating this bufi- 1
, ness was in the power of Government, as it f
; was a power pofTerted by every Nation, which t
1 it had a right to exercise for its own security ;
1 but it ought to be exercised according to law. e
. In some countries, indeed, this power is vefl- e
> ed in the Executive. In France, he believed, c
t it was wholly so, and in England in a great e
s degree ; but in this country he trailed that f
t this house would be of opinion that Congress r
r is the proper body to regulate so important a c
. maafure. c
But theevil, Mr. G. said, did not stop here, c
it extended to all the citizens of the United 1
j States. The object of the lafl feflion provides t
5 that juffices, judges, marfluls, fhenffsand the '
â  people at large shall perform a duty which is {
â¢ undefined. But the gentleman from MafKi- f
, j chufetts lays this is right, because the power v
7 j given to the Exeeutive by this bill, is also fl
" undefined. Thisis the foundation of all the 0
1 | objection made to this bill; it is to the total ! v
, | want of legislation in it, which leaves, not on- I
. j ly alien enemies, but citizens of the United \ t
1 ' States, to the will of the President. I t
[ I But he would go farther, and fay it is pofli- ! a
ble to define the duties of our own citizens, ! I
though the two firft fettions ef the bill should i 0
be left at large as they are. By the present j d
bill, thÂ£ duties of justices, &c. are to be regu- ! a
lated by the Proclamation of the President. I v
He could conceive "that the house might take ! 11
into consideration the nature of the powers t
vested in the President, and inauire what will ! c
be the duties to be performed by the several : d
Officers of Government to carry into effect n
those powers. Those powers are to apprehend, j p
refirain, secure and remove Alien Enemies, o
and to sequester their property. As to the v.
removal of Aliens, he could not fee what jus- j si
tices a adjudges had to do vith it: but it they d
had any thing to do with it, Congre/s ought ii
to fay what. They might fay what should be , d
the duties of judges or justices, or of Â£xecu- j tl
tive Officers 111 tie several cases which may ])
be likely .to occur, infltad of leaving the thing tl
wholly at large. a.
The last part of the 3d feftion, he said, was ' o
as objettionable as any other. It defines the rr
crime ia two words " harbouring and conceal - ei
ing ? " and the penalty if found guilty of this di
vague anc uncertain charge is imprisonment, tc
not exceeding seven years, and a fine not ex- w
ceeding one thousand dollars. So that if aper- v
son be found guilty of harbouring and con- u
cealing an Alien enemy, however trifling the rr
offence may be, his piinifhrnent will be left tl
wholly to the discretion of the Court. The c:
only power of the Jury will be to decide on the w
fact and if a citizen has harboured for one n
night, however undefignedly an alien enemy p
he must be found guilty, leaving it altoge
ther to the court to judge of the criminality n
los the att, and to affix the degree of punifli- tl
ment. He thought this part of the law ought li
to be better defined. It ought to distinguish w
between cases of misdemeanor, and those d
which might arise from ignorance, and in n
which 110 offence atall might exist. He hop- si
ed therefore the bill would be recommitted. n
The question on recommitting the bill was tl
put and carried 46 to 44. The Yeas and Nays n

Mr. Hindman an address from th;

Mr. Matthews presented an address to coi

Mr. Otis reported two biljl?, one for the vvii
relief of persons imprisoned for debts due to be
the United States ; the other supplementary
to an act for the relief of persons imprisoned
for debt, which were twice read, and commit
ted for Friday.
The order of the day was called tor on the
resolutions of yesterday laid upon the table by
Mr. Sitg Rea v es, proposing to inftruit 'the
Commanders of our public and private armed,
veflels j which being read,
JVfr. Sitgreaves moved should be com
mitted to the Committee appointed for the
protedtion of Commerce and the defence of
the Country, and that they be inftru&ed to
report by bill or otherwtfe.
Mr. Macon hoped they would not be re
ferred to that committee ; but as the fubjedt
was very important, they firftgo to a commit
tee of the whole houfeon the State ot the
Union, in order to be difcufled, before they
were referred to a Select Committee to report
by bill. i
Mr. Sitg reaves believed the course
which he proposed was .conformable to the
pradtice on similar occasions. He agreed that
the subjeCt was important, and that it requi
red deliberate consideration, and full discus
sion ; but in the mean time he willied them
to be referred in the way he hud mentioned.
Mr. M'Dowell was in favour o-f a refer
ence to a committee of the whole. No subject
ever came before this -Congress, or any for
one, offo alarming a nature as this. He wiHi
ed, therefore, before these resolutions were
j fandtioned by a reference to a Select Com
mittee Jo report by bill, that they should un
dergo a difcuflion. He thought a contrary
course would create an alarm which he con
ceived to be unfteceflary ; for he did not be
lieve the situation of this country authorised
the taking up or passing of these resolutions.
The President, he faid,hadthe power to give
such directions to the Commanders of our ves
sels as our situation makes proper, and he
was not, at present, in favourof changing that
situation. He hoped, therefore, the resoluti
ons would be referred to the committee of the
whole on the State of the Union.
Mr. Davis enquired whether it would not
! be in order to portpone the consideration of
| these resolutions to a day certain ? On being
| answered by the Speaker in the affirmative,
! Mr. D. moved that the further cr afideration
I of this question be postponed till the 2d Tuef
| day in June.. He said, he did not thinlc. this
a proper time to take up this fubjedt. If he
was called upon to vore on these resolutions
now, he should be obliged to vote againlt
them. He knew only qf two things which
could warrant such a step being taken, viz. a
declaration of war, or the return of our com
miflianers, & their averring peace could not be
preserved with the French republic. Until
oneofthofe events, took place, it would be
with reluctance that he should vote foramea
fure like the prefeut. Some gentlemen, in
deed, declare we are now in war with France;
if they are serious in such a declaration, why
do they not brihg forward a proposition to
that eff"edV ? If there be a majority in the
house ready (o declare war, and will do it,
then he should no longer be at a loss how to
aft; He could then no longercherifli a hope
of prefeCving peace, which, however feeble it
might now be, he was unwilling to part with
entirely. When once our (late was expressly
declared to be a (late of war, he (hould be ready
to go iiU o any measure of defence or offence,
which the ingenuity of gentlemen could de
vise ; but whilst the fate of our negociation is
unknown, whilst our commiflioners yet re
main at Paris, (and if not proceeding with
their negociation, their flay there is unac
countable) he was unwilling to do any tTiing
which should either fru(irate any treaty which
may be in train, or hazard the fafety of the
persons of our commissioners.
Mr. D. said, lie would not have made this
motion if lie thought it would have delayed
the preparing of the veflels for sea. He be
lieved not mure than three of the vessels
would be ready before that time ; and if the
dire&ions to be given to the commanders are
ready as the vellels are prepared to
fail,-they will be loon enough. Hehopedthe
motion would, therefore, be agreed to. I.i
tbt mean time probably fame information
might be received, which would enable gen
tlemen to determine upon the question with
more propriety than at present,
Mr. Harper did not agree in either of the
reasons given by the gentleman from Kentuc
ky, in favour of his motion. He did not be
lieve the (late of affairs betwixt this country
and France was uncerFain ; and ifit were, he
did no* think it would be any reasonable
ground for acting as he proposes.
With refpeit to the situation of our affairs
with France being uncertain, lie believed no
thing more was necessary to convince gentle
men to the contrary, than that they (hould
cad their eyes upon what is now taking
place every day. It will be seen that the de
predations committed upon our commerce
become daily more enormous. We know that
our commissioners have no hope ofaccbmmo
dation with France ; we know they have
passed a decree by which nine-tenths of our
commerce is proscribed. It had frequently
been said that that decree would only affeit
our trade with Great Br;tain ; but if the de
cree be examined it will be found to affect al
moll every cargo with which our vessels are
laden ; besides the smallest article of dress of ;
tjie captain, or any of the crew being Britilh, '
would be fufficient for a condemnation of 1
vessel and cargo. There were also a num- ]
ber of articles which, though they might not i
come from Britifli poffellions, being no way i
different from such as do come from thence, |
would form a fufficient ground of capture ;
such were cotton, coffee, lugar and rum. In
deed, the French seem determined to make 1
prize of every vessel they meet with ; for if 1
a role d'equipage be the criterion which they <
chufe to adopt to determine, thy will a(k for c
it, and destroy it, and then take the vessel for c
not having one ; and when they find no other
cause forleizure, they forgf"falfe (hip papers c
to make the vessel and cargo liable to confif- '
cation. And when we lee all our vellels,
whether from the East and Weft Indies, or f
from Europe, taken and carried into French a
ports, (hall we (fill fay we are in a ftatc of c
peace ? Or that our situation is uncertain ! r
This decree was passed on the 10th of Ja
nuary, and though our accounts from Bour- 1
leaux are tip to the 19th of March, we know t
that it is yet in exiilence, and though the re- t
port ofourcommiliioners having beenreceiv- c
'd, may be true, (though he did not believe ?
t) yet whilst that decree is in existence, lie â¢
â¢ouhl not fav our situation is problematical. '
With a nation which .takesall our vessels, si
without discrimination, we cannot be said t L > u
>e a: peace. t |
y Bat what is our state with refpecl to France t
d Some days agcj we had a report that our coiu
miffioriers had had an audience of the Directo
ry ; but subsequent accounts tell us that this
c is not true, that they have no profpict of set
)' tling otrr disputes, and that Hie demand of;Â«
e loan of u millions is now grown into one of
d, 2j millions. Yet gentlemen ticink the fituai
tion of this country problematical.
- our commitfioners remain in France, was,Â».'Â» â 
e deed, to him problematical, and he could osv
>f ly account for it by supposing they are kept
0 there contrary to their will ; for, so long ago
as the 31ft of January, they fay they have no
- hope of accommodating our differences, and
t it they did not, in a few days, receive an an
- fwer to their memorial, they fliould apply for
e passports, and come home. The French go
f vernment had, however, only to delay giving
t them pafl'ports, and they would)>e obliged to
remain ; xndhe thought it highly probable
' that they would detain our comuiiliioners as
' jiollages, in order to extort money from 11s.
t This, he owned, was mere conjeiture, but he
- thought it very rational conjecture. Still we
fay our lituatitjn is pr bematical; (fill we fay
1 we will remain defencelefs, we will fuffer
French privateers to cut up our trade, ani
within 50 miles of Charleston, land on our
t coal}, and carry off our property. This, he
- conferred, tVas very unaccountable conduit:
- and lie believed France would accoinplifli her
; objeit, it wÂ« remained inactive, catching at
every idle rumour which conveys any hope of
accommodation. She will continue to de-
I (troy our trade and ravage our coalfs, except
some measure of this kind is gone into, which
(hall er.able us to drive from our fliores all
I the picaroons and armeft vessels which infefl
it. 1 his could not be done, without inttruc
: tions like the present were given to our ves
sels ; for, it the Prelident were to fend our
; armed vclfels out with such inflruClions only
t as he has now the power to give, vessels might
lie without our jurifdiclibn (beyond which
; our vessels would not have a right to go) and
take our merchant-men within fight of our
t armed vessels, and they would not have it in
f their power to render them any aUiftance, ex
; ceptthe attack.were made in light, and with
, in the jurisdiction of the United States. In
, our present situation, Mr. H. thought we
ought to life the arms we have. One of our
i armed vessels, he laid, was dropped down the
Delaware, and he was certain the people out
; of doors, whatever might be the opinion of
: gentlemen on that floor, was desirous we
1 should drive off or bring in the swarms of pri
-1 vateers and piccaroons which are upon our
coast; those privateers and piccaroons which
: not content with capturing ourvellels, do not
1 scruple to fire upon our officers 111 the txe
: cution of their duty. If this was an equivo
cal situation, or if this was equivocal conduit
in France, then was he at a loss to fay what,
short of an army being landed in the country,
would induce us to resist. It was not the
purpose of France, Mr. H. supposed, to go
farther than this, whilst she can keep our
commiflioners in Paris, paralyze our efforts at
home, and continue to rob and plunder us,
she will be fatisfied, and will never attempt
to invade our territory. She will continue to
take our velTels wherever (he can meet with
them, and (according to Vidtor Hughes's de-,
finition) let none pais, which have any thing
on board worth taking. And (fill we fay our
state is problematical.
Mr- H. said he could not help deploring
this unaccountable delusion which had taken
jioffeflion of certain gentlemen in that house,
but under which he could not believe a majo
rity of it could he drawn. He did Irope that
ail remaining doubts on this head had been
done away ; but he perceived he was mifiak
en, he trussed however, that those who tire
sensible of the necellity there exifls for taking
active measures against France, will, unite on
this qccafion, and that the number who fhalt
be of a contrary opinion will be f'mall indeed.
Mr. M'Dowell observed, that the gen
t eman trom S. Oaiohna had gone into 3
lengthy argument on the qurSion for poll.
ponement; but he did not think his state
ments were corrcft. He differed widely
from him in opinion. He ftatea that there
can be no djubt that Frai ce m ans to be at
war with this country. Mr M'D asked
what in'ormation we h id received iron our
Commissioners which could lead to this idea
since the dispatches dateu the 19thof March?
He knew of nothing. He thought every
thing since had rather been favourable than
otherwifs. True it was, Mr. M'D. said,
that the French Nation lias injured us ex
tremely, by taking our vessels, and insulting
our rights. But the queltion is, whether
we ought, for the fake of protefling a part
of our trade to Great Britain, and ia order
10 obtain British to go to war?
The gentleman from S. Carolina fays, that
our vessels arc ftized without difcriminktion-
He did'not know frbm what f urcehe got
his information, for howerei flagrant the
conduft of the' French towards us may be,
this is certainly not correft.
Mr. M D. laid, he (hould be glad to know
where the gentleman from "y. Carolina got
hiÂ» information, that the French had landed
on the southern coast, and carried off some
property from thence ? It that were true,
it would beaferious fact. ("Mr. Haperfaid',
the faÂ£l was in all the p pers], Mr. M'D.
said, he often saw things in the newspapers
to which he gave but little credit, and this ,
was one of those things. If such an event
Imd taken place, he was confident that the
Officers of Government in t' at part of the
country would before now have communi
catcd the faÂ£t to Government. Mr. M'D.
did not believe the exaggerated fiatements of
the gentleman from S. Carolina j and whilst
he had anv hopes of accommodating our dif
ferences with France, he (hould with to avoid
a declaration of war, .or any measures whose
certain tendency would be war. Gentlemen
fay we have nothing to defend our coatts,
the enemy may come and lavage them. Some
time ago a number of vcilUs were a(k?d for
t'Â«e purpose of protefling our trade on the
coast. It was objeStd to their being used
?s convoys on the high seas, left they (hould
involve US in war. They were, however,
granted, without any reftriÂ£tion as to thtir
ule. But these do noj gratify gentlemen.
They now tall ujion she houfc tÂ» go into
[Volume XIII.a measure which mull ineviubly produce
war, and which will destroy every remaining
h pe of accommodation.
Mr. M'D. wished to call to the view of
the house the llate of things which they are
about to bring about in this country. Let
gen lemcn refleft upon the prosperity which
we have enjoyfd (or rriany years back, from
a llate of peace and tranquility. But if the
measures succeed which are now taking to
induce this house and the people of the Uni
ted States to go to war with France, this
country must again become a scene of blood
and devastation ; numbers of our valuable
citizens must be deprived of existence, and
mimbÂ»rlefs wWows and children be deprived
of their husbands and fathers, and others of
their best frieÂ»d9. Such a llate of things
nfav arrive, as (hall make it neceflary to n.eet
the distress and horrors of war, but they
Kwiught not lightly to be encountered. Those
who hail been witnefc to the tniferies occafi
oned by our lad war, could not but bt anxi
ous to ai oid any tntafures which must aijain
introduce simitar fcenes'of mifcry to our view.
Gentlemen who are young and ambitious,
pu(h on their fcheaies without duly calcuja
ting their consequences. \ien whe wish at
any rate to involve this country in war,, in
order to aflimilate our government to that of
Britain, will go all lengths to carry their
point. He could not fay that was real- 1
ly their view, in pu(hing the country, firft !
by an. step and then another into war ; but i
he -vifhtd to avoid'unreceflary war. And ;
nothi 'g could induce htm more to oppose a j
war with France, than the strong convifti
-011 with which its mind was imprefted. that
the certain consequence will be an alliance
with Great Britainâa government which
he looked upon as the worst upon earth
Â£ I he taidj no oblervations relative
to an A'liance with Great Britai 1 or a De- !
claration of War. could pcffibiy be in order
on the prcfent queftion.j Mr. M'D. said, he
meant to (heetf the propriety of postponing
theconfideration of the resolutions before the
honfe, in doing which he found it neciflary
to reply to some remarks which had fallen
from the gentleman from S. Carolina.
Mr. W. C. Claiborne believed that
Prudcme. Policy and Wisdom required the
adoption of the preftn motion. The ques
tion which the discussion of these ref"lu ions
will introduce, being or the very firft impor
tance, to receive due conlideration.
It in no less than whether, under exiftingcir
cumftatices, it will be proper to authorize
offettfive measures against the French Re
public ; and he would alk gentlemen whe
ther they are prepared to meet this questi
on ? Whether they are prepar- dto fay, we
will throw from oar country all the happi
ness of Peace, and plunge it inevitably into
the reiferies of War? If gentlemen were
prepared to give the affirmative to this quef.
tion, he must own, he w;.s hot. He felt
difpefed to pause a little before he voted for
introducing so important a change in the af
fairs of our country, as the de ifion upon
those resolutions must necrlTariiy introduce.
On account of the spoliations committed
upon our commerce by the privateers of
France, he felt all the r t fe.itment which the
get tleman from S. Carolina could possibly
feel, "but he (hould not fuffer it to carrry
him so far as that of his friend from S. Ca
rolina ca ried him. That refentrnent he
strove yet to ftifle, and, for his country's
good, he could wish to ftifle it until ah hopes
of peace are dtftroyed.â Ihe gentleman from
S Carolina fays ail hopes of peace are now
gone. Did he { Mr. '.) think so, he might
ajrree with him in opinion as to the measures
whic he wifhcs 10 lakebut he thought
differently. That gentleman fay ; the dif
patche on tlte table fuppoit his opinion ; I
(said Mr. C.) can have no other refourcefor
ir.y opinion. What, said Mr. C. is the te
nor of the last difpatc'nes from our commilli
oners ? Those gentlemen have Hated to the
Diretlory in a very able and proper manner,
a Memorial containing the grounds of dis
pute between this country and France, and
were waiting an answer, which, if they did
not receive in a few dajs, they meant to ap
ply for paflports so come away. The gen
tleman from S. Carolina supposes, because
our cominiffiotters ire yet in i'atis, that they
are prevented by the governmest from com
i' g away ; he, on the contrary, supposed
that their remaining there was a favourable
circumstance, and (h-. wed that they had some
hopes of yet accomplifliing the objeft of their
million.
Mr. C. alkrd what possible good could be
derived to the country by referring these re
solutions immediately ? Would the doing
of this give proteflion to our Commissioners ?
Or would i preftrve our veffcls from cap
ture ? It could have no such tffeiSl. But
the house are told that one of our (hips of
war is dropped down the Delaware, and that,
in the course of a few weeks, others will be 1
ready, Let us then, said Mr. C. wait those 1
few weeks, before we aft upon these refolu '
tions, and not hurry on to a fituati<n of things '
which will rcqui e forty times the velfels we 1
Save got, and which will effeeluaily fruftrate 1
any treaty which our commissioners may pof- r
fibly be making with the French Govern- c
mer.t. We must, then, expeft to meet all
the injuries which enraged Fiance can cqm- 1
mit upon us. t
Mr. C. trusted gentlemen would refleft a Â°
little before they rcfolve upon the present
measure. He hoped the motion ol his friend
from Kentucky would prevail, and if the in
formation which (hould next be received
from our commissioners, fliould be such as
t > cjft all hopes of pea e from our view,
there would be then unanimity in that house
tor prosecuting the molt fpiritcd measures
whiqli. could be proposed. No divilion
would then be fcen. Every member would
resolve to support the dignity of the country ;
as he sup clcd it was the intention of all to
die upon the foil 011 which thev now live, 1
and that for the of that foil,
each he hoped wqulil willingly (htd all the '
blood which enci cles his heart. j j

lowing address : t
To the PRESIDENT or the UNJTEDSTAIES,
SIR,
While we have the utmost confidence in the
wisdom, integrity and abilities of thofewhoare
conftitutionaliy entrusted with the management
of our national concerns, wc conceive it would I
be improper to ejprefs in opinion relative to the
me a flirts nectfiary to be taken at this important
crifia in our public affairs : but viewing with in
dignation the unprovoked, wanton and cruel at
tack made upon our national rights, by the arbi
trary 1 ulers of France, wc Ihould deem ocrfclves
unworthy the blefiings we enjoy under our free '
and happy government, Ihould we remain silent. '
The repeated inl'ulti offered our government,
and the continued depredations committed on
American property, by the French nationâ the
mean and degrading terms they hold out, as the
only basis 011 which they will negotiateâand
above all, their base iufinuations that the people
of America are so abandoned that thÂ»y will '
tamely fuljmit to, and even jullify such outrag
es on their property, and such indignities to their
government ; are fufficfent to excite the abhor
rence and awaken the energy of every true A
merican. ,
The voice of our fellow citizens addrefied to
you from various parts of the Hnited States, 011
this momentous occalion, affords us a pleating
conlolation ; while it evinces a degree of union i
and firmnefs that may prcferve our country from '
further degradation. 1
Permit us to express our lincere regret, that '
every overture confident with the digniiy of [
.our government, "has been tiied in vain for the t
amicable adjullment of our difference with France
and for the attainment of. peace. Whilewcre- c
fled), that the inhabitants of this place have not c
been exempted from the severest fnfferings which '
war inflicts, -\ve have reason to appretiate the r
b eflings of peace ; but Â«e can never consent to J
[jurchafe peace at theexpence of our national
honor and sovereignty. With these impreflious |
we do mod lolemnly pledge ourselves to the ex- (
tent of out abilities and at the risque of our lives e
to support such measures as have been or may be f
adopted by the executive of our government, 1
to preserve inviolate our independence and na- 8
tioatl dignity and to protedl our civil and reli- 1
gious rights.

Tc JOHN ADAMS,
PRESIDENT OF the UNITED S PATES.
Attached by every tie that can bind us to the
mofl ardent love of our country we cannot refrain
from exprefft ng the great solicitude we feel on the
fithjeft of the present eventful period of cur na
tional affairs. Conscious of the honefly and juf
t'ce of cur government towards every nation in
the world with which it hath had any delations,
we confidently flattered ourselves with the expec
tation that we should have preserved our neu
tralityÂ», asd the en oyment of peace throughout
the fanguiijary war which hath so long and d&tb
flill continue to spread havoc and defoliation thro 9
feve al parts of Europe. The rapacity and ag
gressions however of one of the belligerent nations
do now very seriously threaten to dlflurb that
tranquility, which the virtue and the wifetom of
our rulers have, endeavored mofl earnefllyto pre
serve. IVe rely with great confidence on the good
sense fortitude and integrity of our fellow citi
zons throughout the union, to repel every attack %
both foreign and domejlic to which we may be
exposed, and we do mofl solemnly pledge ourselves
to support with cheerftilnejs and with prompti
tude, such meafur/s for the preservation of the
1 independence and sovereignty of our country as
Congress and our rulers may in their wisdom deem
ex ed 'tent. The prudent but energetic regulations
which yoil have adopted andpurfued with regard
to the unfuccefsjul negotiation with the republic
t of France, have been, we conceive, jlriftly con
fident with the honor and dignity of a great na
tion, and demonflrate in the flrougefl terms your
unceaftng regard for our common interefl ; and
merit a coutinuation of our unfeigned and grate*
3 ful acknowledgments. We rejoice in the profpeSt
. of unanimity on the present important occafion â
One sentiment appears to prevade our land ; to
. devote our lives and fortunes to the maintenance
[ of our rights as a free people. Under these im
; preffions we wbvfe lots are cafl on the frontiers
of our country, beg leave to express our sentiments
on the occafion âour pursuit being agriculture,
i we have no words that we expefl will be more
grateful to the government we love, and will
not part with, but with our lives than those of our
ftneere assurance, that we will fuhmit with cheer
fulnefs to any equal iax the wisdom of our gov*
ernment may lay on us for the national support
and that we will march with alacrity to any
part of the union to repell an intruder â¢

GENTLEMEN,
I thank you for your addref), presented ~to me
by your representative in Congress, Mr. Co*brmo.
'lhe solicitude ycu feel in the present eventful
period oj our national affairs, is common to the
govt rnment and people, to all who are attached
to their country by an ardent love of it.
Tour reliance on the good sense, fortitude and
integrity of your fellow citizens, / tmjt will not
deceive you, all depends upon tbeje virtues. If
these fail us, we an -10/ l, our conflitutmn and
adoiinifl rat ion all depend upon them. Our gov
ernment without these aids has no power it home
, or abroad / IVe have no other principle of Union
or capacity of defence.
Tour unfeigned acknowledgments are very o*
bliging to me, and the clear assurances of support
to the fneafures of government, are very encou
raging f 9 us all. Tour lot on the frontiers, and
your pursuit i of agriculture, give a weight to your
fentim&ts ; you may be fuppofedt\be less heated
h PlffiWy less affeSed by prejudices % and less in
fluenced by partial or local interejlj than the in
habitants of great citiesâ¢
There can be no flronger proofs (jf patriotism,
than a cheerful Jubmiffion to any fax which the
TAiifdom of government may impose, or than a
promise to march alacrity, to an) part of
the union to repel an intruder.

THE ANSWER,
Of the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, to
the \ OUNG MEN of Boston.
gentlemen,
IT is impoflible for you to enter your own Fan
ieul-Hall, or 10 throw your eyes on the variegated
mountains, and elegant islands around you, without
lecolle&ing the principles and a&ions of your
and feeling what is due to their example ;âOne of
their)?*)? principles was to unite in themselVes thÂ«
character of citizens and foldÂ»ers, and especially to
preserve the latter always Ju.bordir.atc to the Jormerl
With much solicitude for your welfare, and that
of your posterity, I take the freedom to fay, that this
country never appeared to me to be in greater danger,
than at this momeut, from within or withoutânever
more urgently excited, to alliime the lunfttons oi
foldters..
The Hate of the world is such, the situation of all
the nations of Europe, with which we have
isfocrtical, that viciflrudes mud be expelled, from
whole deleterious influences* nothing but arms and
energy can protest us. To arms, then,, my young
friendsâto arms, especially by fca, to be used as the
laws shall oireÂ£t, let us resort; for fafety against dan
gers, which we now fee and feel, cannot be averted
by TRUTH, REASON or JUSTICE.
Nothing in the earlier pan of my public life, ani
mated me more, than ,the countenances of the chiU,
dren and youth of the town of Bofjon ; and nothing
at this hour, gives me so much pleafuie, as the ma'-
culine temper and Talents, difpiayed by the youth of
America, in every part of it.
I < ughf not to forget the worst* enemy we have s
Thai obloquy, which you have obferved,is the worst
enemy 10 virtue,and the best friend to vice : it drives
to deitroya'l diflin&ion between right and wrong, it
leads to division, fcdition, civil war, and military
defpotiim.â I need fay no more.

a l Could the excellent Memorialof the Ame
h rican Envoys be a; generally read by the
f. citizens of France, as the French appeals
d were by thepeople of this country,it would
be a difficult matter to persuade deluded
Frenchmen to draw the sword against their
d allies. But this expeftation is vainâthe ty
; rants who at present rule that endaved na
d tion, not only watch over the presses, but
e keep a jealous eye on the mails and public
d couriers. Indeed we have but little to hope
e for, but from the spirit and resources of our
j own country. Reconciliation seems to be
quite impoflible. The lawlefsinflruments of
rapine and plun-ier, not content with pillag
" ing ourveffelswithin our capes, have in some
instances, landed on our islands, and carried
off the farmer's (lock. M<iy the fire of refrnt

HAVING observed an advertisement of C.
Gullager, in terms derogatory of our pro
fessional abilities, we have to request the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to
decide upon the merits of each by a comparison ot
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta
lents of ellablifhed artift#, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrofling that bufinefe which
their profeflional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opinion must
govern, we flatter ourselves that the work execut
ed by us will convince them of our great superio
rity over Mr. Gullager in every branch of por
trait and ornamental painting, and (hew the necef
(ity of judgingfor themselves.
N. B. In future no attention will be paid to thj
fdf-flattering advertisements of Mr G.
