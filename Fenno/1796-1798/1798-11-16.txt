r - j Gentlemen,
AS many of your subscribers flill doubt
of the arrival of Buonaparte at Alexandria,
â  r I think you cannot do better than publish
the enclosed ex t raft from a late London pa
-11 ' per, and also th>paragtaph from alatenum-
I ber of the United States Gazette, for by
- comparing them you will find that general
i Serurrier was swallowed by a Crocodile, on
- the 19th June, and that he was in the U
-5 nited States on or about the 19th Oftobtr.
. Your doing so will at oncfc convince the
greated fctptSc of Buonaparte's arrival, and
n farther (which is of great confeattenee to
" tjie Virginia Philosopher) it determines thÂ«
fwiftnefs of the Crocodile, for r.o doubt
the Frenchman put her to the greatest spied.
How the citizen general fared upon the paf
e sage I cannot conceive-âexcept by his so
- long being in the French army of Italy, he
e might have learned to lay the young under
contributionâbat that he was on the banks
of the Nile it certain, and that he is now
'â¢ here is as certain, if we can believe the
newspapers. These Frenchmen are devils,
MelT. Printers, and should it be a fa&. that
r general Serrurier Las got to this country by
such a strange conveyance, we may then ex
' pest by our nrxt arrivals from India, to
0 heart that Buonaparte's array (except the
1200 that did not embark, or rather were
not swallowed by the Crocodile*) is fafe ar
rived at Mangalore. And, pray gentle
' men, what iÂ« the afe of a navy in a cafe of
this kind ? Ws mud get a fleet of Allega
Â» tors from the Southern States, or we are
1 ruined. CERTAIN.

1 Hung in fix {kjcl, and blazing as be travelled."
| the great Buonaparte is no more consign
ed to the merciless jaws of a cruel Crocodile.
" As well as my anguilh and tears will
permit, I (hall briefly relate to yon this
tragical event. Having taken peffeifion of
the city of Alexandria, the general proceed
-1 ed haitily to fortify the harbor. Some dif
turbances arose, which were fomented by'a
Turkish Pacha with three tails, all of which
byway of punidimetir, the general ordered
r to be cut off. The unfortunate man indeed
r had a fourth which he earnestly entreated
to have spared, but Buonaparte, who ne
ver approved of half meafurcs, ordered that
also to.be cleared away.
" All necessary preparations being made,
the army confiding of 18,000 men, took the
dirtiliot) of Aleppo, marching in good or
der along the banks of the Nile. General
Serrurier, who fat out the day before, Was
' cotfiderably forward with the advanced
guard when Buonaparte began his march,
which was rapid, but exceedingly fatiguing
from the exceflivc heat of tie weather. On
the approach of night we found ourfelvta in
a fine plain, on the banks ot the river Nile,
but in some places rather fwaiapy. Here
the army halted for the night, and Buona
parte, as pious as iEneas himfelf, determi
ned to omit no religious duties, ordered the j
foldfers to sing the Marfelleis Hymn five
timet in honor of the Direftory, and Ca Ira
twice in honor of the two councils; after '
| which they danced the Carmagnole, and lay
down to reft.
" While the others were asleep, I pro
ceeded to an adjoining eminence with my
telcfcopes, in order to make some observa
tions upon jSyrius. At firft I perceived that I
the dog appeared to wear a surly afpeft,
when on a sudden his countenance shewed a
: wonderful degree of brightness, and " mira
bilediaum!" he seemed to wag his tail.
After gazing for some time with astonish
| ment at this strange pheenomenon, I turned
Bty eyes towards the river, and beheld issu
ing from its banks, and marching direftly
for the Republican camp, an army of at lealt
12,000 alligators. I would immediately
have cried out, butâ
â¢â¢ Obttupyi, (Uteruntque ; torn*, et voÂ« faucibus
hxGt.'f
" The devouring moofters ptpJued the'r
march with regularity and silence, furroutid
ed the lleeping camp, and immediately pro
ceeded to fatisfy their abominably voracious
appetites with the flefh and blood of true-
Republicans. Judge, my dear friend, of
my horror and delpair, when I saw a croco
dile, at lea ft 40 feet in length, enter the tent
of the Hf rÂ«i of Italy, and how much stronger
were my feelings when I perceived the mon
ster come out with Buonaparte in his jaws,
having already devoured the whole of his
Aides de-camp. I knew the General by
the boots in which he slept, and ray heart
was tortured on hearing his cries, while the
amphibious moriftcr;â
" Vifceribus miferorum, gi linguine vefcitur atro."

" The gallant Berthier was seized by j
another of these monsters, Â»r,d the fearlefs r
Maflena plunging into his enormous throat |
to relieve and bring out his friend, the vora
cious crocodile swallowed them both down t
like an oyjler. (
"Nt fueh wai the fate of. the valiant 1
general Victor j for while he was in the jwa.s ]
of an aligator, which extended them at the t
fame time to fwellow a chajfeur, the latter 1
â  fixed his carbine iUiidjng between the two
jaws, whjcli the monster being unable to
Ihut, the General walked out without the
ftnalleft injury, except that his fa(h was mod
foully daubed with the gore of former vic
tims.

" At length, tfie remainder of the camp

D DUBLIN, September 13.
C ExtraÃ of a letter from Granard, Sept, 12ih
containing some further account of the a3i n
iviilh took place there between the Yeoman
Â£ ty and the Rebels on the sth in/lant.
â¦Â« On the evening of tlie 4th instant, in- j
e formation was received that the Rebels were
collecting in this neighbourhood in great Â«
force, and had committed dreadful depreda- ;
tions en the property of the inhabitants in j
this vicinity ; this was fooa authenticated [
by unfortunate families flying from all fides
' into, the town, aid taking refuge in the (
barracks. r
" Tne Rebels at this time marched to
Edgeworftown and ditarmed a party of the t
Maftrim Cavalry, commanded by Captain r
Bond. On the morning of the sth inlt. in- a
f ormation being received that they were ad- c
vancing towards this town, the garrison, t
confiding of flie Granard and Bailymacue c
Cavsjlry, detachments of the Cavan, Ballin- {
temple, and' Kilmore Infantry, under the
command of Capt. Cottingham, and the (
Ballymacue Infantry, under the command f
of Capt. Palla*, marched out to meet them. n
" They appeared within a mije of the j
town iii great force 5 upwards of 4,000,
" armed with mufquets and pikes, command v
j ed by Alexander Defii don, Lieutenant in {,
Captain Bond's corps of cavalry, Mr. Hans t
1 Deniflon, Mr. O'Connell, and Mr. Miles f
O'Reilly, all of this neighborhood ; they
' were drawn out in line of battle, opposed t
to our handful, and firft, as er a few vollies â ]
1 were exchanged, their flanks filed off, in- u
tending to surround us ; at the fame time a
the centre division marched forward, driv
ing before them above 200 head of cattle.
1 This obliged us for a moment to re treat,
which was effected in good order, until we
reached the Moat, a high eminence com
manding the town, when a hot and well Â®
directed fire was kept up, which soon ob- v
: liged them to break and fly in all direftions ; Ij
the cavalry then charged and completed
their deftru&iou .} while the centre diviflon |
1 was attackingthe Moat, the flanks advanced
to assail the barrack, but the fire from the
1 walls and temporary bastions that were late- a
ly erefted, foo.n obliged them to retreat.
1 " The (laughter was immenseâabout
1 150 were left dead on the field, and the
corpses of feveial others have been found
: fiqce in the corn fields. O'Connel, one of
their captains, was killed, as also Farrel,
one of captain Bond's cavalry, who fell in
his uniform. The garrison confided of
174 infantry, and 5Â© cavalry, without a
' regular soldier, or any cannon.'-' P

I that we might knew each other, being then
within muflcet-fhot ; <he did not think

~ boneft man in America witl hear- '

'' Buonaparte may meet the fate of the apostate '
Julian- Happily, this wish, far from be-- J
a ing chimerical, is exalted by our newi of '
velferday, into a well-grounded expe&ation.
In tracing the tracks of former adventurers
e on ihis h&xardous theatre of action, as ac- '
e curatdy as t'ie scanty materials furnifhed us '
* will allow, we difceirn no of the 1
fuccefb of any enterprise undertaken in fimi- I

? But, without inllituting a comparison be- j
tween the course of Alexander' and that of ,
Buonaparte, it is worth while to advert to <
y the far greater degree of similarity, which <
appears, both between the conduA and the '
le t characters of the Imperial apoltate and the 1
*" Gallic assassin. '
j : The certainty of the defeat and deftruc
-1" | t'on of the maritime force, added to the i
; total loss of a large army and immetife body i
of officers, with a man at their head, who, >
r however infamous for the atrocity of his '
crimes* and, whether an able general or not, '
; was worth, from his popularity, more than
Ie an hundred thousand njen, mall prove a
n daggering blow even to so ColofTal a cower i
as that of the Great Nation. Already I fee i
the revolutionizing crew, thole ill-omened 1
birds of prey, who have so long devoured j
3 the vital* of the empire, trodden every !
l ~ where under the foot of the fuffering pea- ,
j tani and the oppressed gentleman. Barbers ,
' and valets shall no more aÂ£l over the r go- <
| vernmeutal gambol*, TKid V dressed in aJit
e" tie brief authority, play such fautaftic tricks '
"j before high Heaven, as makes e'en Angels
L weep." The Dire&orial Harlequin may '
dance his antic hornpipe ; but others shall
no longer pay the piper. America, freed
r> 'from the gripe of fanfculottifm, and frater- .
y nization, shall yet live, and, having nothing
a efe to do, begin, at last, to take care of her
. felf. In this woik, she may fiad a tafk're
: quiring all the energy of thought and a&iou,
' ; which charafterized of old the sages and
' j heroes of Greece and Rome, when thefalus
! r \ptpuli was guarded by a Lycurgus and a
lr | Solon from the keeping of Democratic ruf
l" fians, and promoted by a Dictator, who
knew how to direst again ft the enemies ef
j. the State the just vengeance of the law.
The MofUms, pulled by the whiflrers, wince :
>- This is all good. Let the work go on. Citi-
V zen Revolution has probably yet to take a tour
through Turkey- to instil into the patient Muf
felrpan, the many " Jimple virtues" of the
great nation. Their modesty, their benevolence
y their geiierolity, theirhumanity ! their disinter-
I, eftedpefs, their m'-ffenfivenefs, their incorrup
j] tibility, all offer to the wpnderiug Turk, lessons
by which he may improve upon a system now
r quite Sjbaritian, compared with tfceir*.
The fartfculottifh Admiral Brueyt, ws,
it seems, difpatohed to the other world,
amidst fire and flame. Shakespeare would
call this " A sore-taste of that which is to
come." Would to G<ti, the here and the
J hereafter of al( Jacobins might be fpesdily
affimilated.
i Commoti"ns threaten the estates of the
double-faeed villain apd fool of Pruffiaâ
the author of all the evils of the last four
years. To him, "on horror's head, may
'â¢* horrors accumulate."
I Two men lately disputing on the accom
modations provided for prisoners, in the dif
'* fcrt'itt jails in the United States, found fomc
difficulty in agreeing which merited- a pre
' lerence, when one of them put an end to
the dispute by declaring Philadelphia to be
, the belt, as he. had tried them all.

The French, wonderful nation ! seem to
' J imagine themielves defigncd for the Cru
>r fader* or Knights Errant of the world.
America had but to cry opprejfton, and they
were in arms to deliver Iter. Since that
* how cxtenflve has been their benevolence in
jj this way : the Turks have just heeo deliver

ii they contend on hÂ»!y land, we may console
>e ourselves with the reflection that no Chrijiian
" blood will be spilled.
o After all the various conjc&ures, it ap
Â° pear- most probable that Buonaparte was
. bent on succouring Paffawan Oglou in his
, Â£ rebellion. That word Rebellion has a charm '
d which draws the French as crows to carrion. J

early flight of the Inhabitants from the Citv, de
priving the laboring claffcs of employment] ant',

which grt*t numbers of them were erouded to
gether m fnijll buildings, rendering their filia

of extending relief to them at their fcveral hib

of a few might (helt.r them from disease, and
idrainiller to their neeeflities. This has been
clFeÂ£uallÂ» performed by the Committee : Few
