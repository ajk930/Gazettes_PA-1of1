â 
On Thursday, } . Sitgreaves and Mr-
Chapman, ef the-1 jufe of Rep'refentatives
presented the following Add r efs'to the Pre
sident of thcUnited- States.
At a meeting of a number of inhabitants of
the Borough ofEafton, in Pennsylvania,
convened on Tuesday evening the firft of
May 1798, agreeably to invitations pre
% vioufly given, it was resolved to present
the following Address :
7Â» tbe Prefdent of the United States.
SIR,
Taking into confederation the prefcnt cri
tical and interesting llate of our country, in
consequence of the unprovoked hostilities
of the French Republic, we conceive it our
duty to assure you, that the disposition yoÂ«
have manifefted, in your repeated attempts
by negociation to continue and secure to its
the blessings of peace with that government
has received our warmed apptobation.
The inftruftions given to cur Envoys
Extraordinary are to us fatisfa&ory proofs
that you have been influenced by motives of
the purest patriotism ; and whilst you have
used every propermeanto conciliate a friewd
ly disposition in the government of France
towards us, we are happily convinced that
you have not compromitted the honor or
dignity of our country by a surrender of
that independence (o dear to every American.
The unjust aggressions committed and
committing by the French Republic on our
defencelefs commerce, the hostile views of
that government continually manifefted to
wards ours, and the open avowal of their
dependence on a fa&ion in the very bosom
of our country devoted to their interests, are
considerations fufficient to induce all 'rue
Ameticans firmly to unite in defence of their
common country. Ye< we have rcafon to
lament that there exist, among us, men
\jho call themselves Americans, so loft or
milled relative to the true interest of their
country, as to refufe their fan&ion to those
measures, which can alor.e protgft us from
the mischievous and dangerous attempts of
that unprincipled powerwhich threatens our
existence as a nation. We trust however,
that the spirit of difur.ion, which has too
long stained the charafter of the American
nation, is nearly extindl ; and that the pe
riod is not far distant when the f eople of this
country will, as on a former memorable oc
casion, be diftinguiflied firm, vir
tuous, and persevering unanimity.
Confiding fully in the disposition you have
invariably (hewn to preferveus from the hor
rors of war, fatisfied that all your measures
have been di&ated by a sincere and ardent
love of your country, and fully relying on
your wisdom and firmnefs in theprefent dan
gerous crisis, we do not hesitate to declare
that we will give our cordial and energetic
by our government for the general good.
Signed by order and on behalf of the Meeting.
â  JOHN ARNDT, Chairman.
Thomas B. Dkck, Secretary.
To this Address the President was pleased
to make the following answer :
To the Inhabitants of the Borough of Eaflon in
Pennsylvania.
GENTLEMEN,
The unprovoked hostilities of the French
Republic are a full proof that innocence a
lone is no adequate proteftion ; it must be
intrenched in tefolution, and fortified with
power.
Your warmest approbation of the disposi
tion manifefted by me, in repeating the at
tempts atnegociation,affords me much com.
fort.
Wben you fee, in the inftruflions to our
Envoys, fatisfafiory proofs of pure patriot
ism ; when you fee every proper mean to
conciliate a friendly disposition in the gov
ernment of France ; when you fee that I
havenotcompromifed the honour or dignity
of our country by a surrender of that inde
pendence so dear to u< all ; you fee all that
I could wifti you to fee.
The unjust aggressions on our commerce
are a demonstration that it ought no longer
to be defencelefs : the hostile views of that
government, continually manifefted towards
us, are proofs that they consider anarchy in
this country is more convenient to them
than government ; their open avowal of
their dependence on a faftion in the very
bosom of our country, devoted to their in
terests, is a proof that they believed such a
faftion to exist.
I trust, with you, that tbe spirit of dis
union is much diminished ; more however
by an event which no man could have fore
feen, than by our own wisdomâbut unless
the spirit of libelling and sedition {hall be
controuled by an execution of the laws, that
spirit will again increase.
When you declare your fatisfa&ion that
all my measures have been diftated by a sin
cere and ardent love of my country, you
touch my sensibility beyond my powers of
e'-preffiot:; when you offer your cerdial aud
energetic support to such means as may be
adopted by government forthegeneral good,
you command the unreserved applause of
every good citizen.
JOHN ADAMS.

ADDRESS
To the President of the United States.
We the Subscribers, being a Committee
on the part of a refpe&able meeting of the
Citizens of Worceftcr county in the State
of Maryland, convened at Snowhill forthe
purpose of exprefling their sense of the eon
dnft of cur government in regard to its fo
reign relations and to declare their determi
nation at this pre fling crisis to support it, do
comtrunicate to you as the unanimous sense
of the said mtrting, lhat your attempts to
restore that harmony between the United
States and the French Republic, which has
beep so unfortunately impaired, and torein
state that good underftandiiig between t le
two nations so defirabletothe loverscf peace,
have been wife and prudent, and intitle you
to the highest evidence of their esteem.â-
Imprefled as they are with the wisdom, an
propriety of the measures hitherto pur uc
in the adminiftratron of our government ; ,
sensible of our present alarming situation,
and believing that our difficulties have heen
occasioned in agreat measure by internal and
foreign machinations, calculated to pro uce
in' France an unfounded opinion that the A
mcrKins are a divided people : In order to
aid in removing an opinion so injurious to
our national eharafter and so hazardous to
ourpeace they will never hesitate to proclaim
to the world their determination, and they do
hereby pledge themselves to you to support j
any measures which may _be adopted by j
the governmertt of their country calculated
to support their rights and assert the dig
nity of the nation. Whilst we thus express
to you the approbation and determination
of our fellow-citizens, we cannot forbear
to declare our abhorrence, of the profligate
and difgraceful conduct of the government
of France which has been disclosed in the
Dispatches from our Envoys. While we
lament the unfortunate necessity of having
to negociate with charafters who do not he
sitate to acknowledge their own
on and to declare that the justice of our
claims will avail us nothing; but that the
only meafrire of their exidrions is the extent
of their power. To* this conduct, those
amiable principles of religion, morality and
forbearance, contained in your late procla
mation, exhibit to Americans a pleasing
com raft.
Permit us also to indulge a hope, that in
this threatening profpeft of our affairs, har
mony and unanimity may pervadeour public
councils and our citizens at large, and to
express our unfeigned wilhes for your health
and happiness ih thetryingfituationin whish
you are placed.

GENTLEMEN,
I have received from the hands of your
Representative, Mr. Dennis, your letter of
the /7th of April, expressing the sense of
the.citizens aflembled at Siiowhill-
Your approbation of the measures of gov
ernment and determination to support them
are very acceptable.
The Dispatches exhibit a scene of cor
ruption, depravity and intrigue, which is
happy to find you observe in it a contra ft to
those amiable principles of religion, moral
ity and forbearance, contained in a late Pro
clamation. Every lover of his country
must join with you in the hope, that in this
threatening profpeft of our affairs, harmo
ny and unanimity may pervade our couucils,
and our citizens at large. I return with
thanks, your kind and unfeigned wishes for
my health and happiness in these trying
times.

Answer of the President of the United
States to the address of the'citizens of
Burlington county, New-Jersey, publish
ed some days Cnce in this Gazette.
To the citizens of Burlington county, in the
Jlate of New-Jersey.
GENTLEMEN,
1 A copy of your unanimous and spirited
resolutions at Mount-Holly on the2ift of
April, has been presented to me by Mr.
r Imlay and Mr. Schureman, two of your
. representatives in congress.
There is nothing in the eonduft of our
enemies more remarkable than their total
contempt of the people, while tljey pretend
â¢ to do all for the people, and of all real re
publican governments ; while they screen
i themselves under some of their names and
1 forms ; while they are erefting military des
potisms, under the dalufive names of re
r prefentative democracies, they are demol
ishing the Pope, by the most machiavel/an
maxim of one of his predecefTors, " If the
1 good people will be deceived, let him be
deceived."
The American people are unquestionably
â  the best qualified, of any great nation in
. the world, by their charadter, habits, and
all other circureftances, for a real republi
can government ; yet the American peo
ple are represented as in opposition, in en
mity, and on the point of hostility against
the government of their own institution,
â¢ and the administration of their own choice.
1 If this were true, what would be the con
s sequence ? Nothing more, nor less, than
I that they are ripe for a military despotism,
: under the denomination of a foreign pow
, er ; it is to me no wonder, that American
f blood boils at these ideas.
Your ardent attachment tÂ»the constitu
tion and government of the United States
and compleat confidence, in all its depart
ments ; your firm resolution, at every ha
zard, to maintain, support and defend,
with your lives, and soi tunes, every mea
sure, which by your lawful representatives,
may be deemed neceflary, to protect the
: rights, !ibÂ«rty, and independence of the
: United Statesof America, will do you honor
â  with all the world, and with all posterity.
Your fourth resolution has penetrated
. my heart, with refpeft, gratitude and af
-1 ieftion.

WEDNESDAYâ MAY 2*
The bill authorizing the President of the U- t
nited States to build or put-chafe a nnmbef of
froall vfffcll, to be employed as gallies,, or other-
wife, was read the third time and â  (
Mr. Otis presented an address from (he inhab
itants of Boston, to the President and the Con
gress of the United States, expreffke of t^ e . ir
approbation of the conduft of the Executive in , ,
its neeociation with the French governmen , (
and a determination to support every mea ure (
agreed upon by Congress ; declaring that they ,
wish to evince the world that the people of Â«
the United States are not humiliated under a co- ,
lonial spirit of fear, nor are they a divided peo- ,
pie, but that they know their rights and are de
termined to support them. Referred to e ]
1 committee of the whole on the State of the ,
U 'm" D. Foster, from the committee of claims i
made a report on the petition of Benjamin Wells i
who prays for further redress than lie has at pre
sent received, for lofies Curtained in the Western :
Infurreflion, in the discharge of his duty as ;
colletfor of the revenue. The report was unfa
vurable, and was committed for Monday.
On motion of Mr. Sewall the hoafe went in
to a committee of the whole on the report made ,
vefterday by the committee for the protection ot
commerce and the defence of the country, on
the fubjea of naturalization ; and the report
having been read, and the firft resolution for'
prolonging the term of residence before aliens
lhall be admitted as citizens being under coniide
ration â â,
Mr. Sew all said, the term of residence now
required from foreigners, before they can be
come citizens, iÂ» five years, The committee
think this period too short, it is much ihorter
than the period adopted by the French govern
ment. The committee were of ppinion that a
refidenee of at least ten year? should be required I;
but this might be left a blank in the bill, ,and af
terwards filled.
Mr. Harper believed it was high time we
Ihould recover from the mistake which this coun
try fell into when it firft began to form its con
stitutions, of admitting foreigners to citizenship.
This mistake, fce believed, had been produce
of very great evils to this country, and unle.s
corre&ed, he was apprehensive these evils would
greatly increase. He believed the time was now
come when it would be proper to declare, that
nothing but birth Ihould entitle a man to citi
zenlhip in this country. He thought this was
the proper season for making the declaration.
He believed the United States had experience
enough to cute them of the folly of believing,
that the strength and happiness of the country
would be promoted by admitting to the rights
of citizenship all the congregations of people
who resort to these shores from every part of the
world. Under these impressions, which, as he
supposed they would have the fame force upon
others, as upon himfelf, he {hould not detain the
committee by dilating upon, as he proposed to
amend the resolution by adding to it the follow
ing words, viz. " that provision ought to be made
bylaw for preventing any per/on becoming enti
tled to the rights of a citizen ef the United States
except by birth" ,
The chairman declared thisamendment would
be a substitute to the resolution before the com
mittee, and therefore not in order.
Mr. Otis said, he would propose an amend
ment which he believed would be in order,
which was as follows, viz. " and that no alien
ytrr/eni a_citiicn of the Unit
ed States, Joull fcereajnx. oe cumâ*.-. t .- v
any office of honor, truji or profit under the Unit
ed States."
Mr. Harper moved to amead this amendment
â  by adding the following words : "or of -voting
i at the elellion of any member of the legislature of
the Unittd States, or of any Jlate"
Mr. H. said, he was for giving foreigners
' every facility for acquiring property, of holding
1 this property, of raising their families, and of
transferring their property to their families. He
; was willing they ihould form citizens for us ;
but as to the rights of citizenship, he was not
willing they ftlould be enjoyed, except by per
sons born in this country. He did not think
this even was desirable by the pei sons themselves.
Why, he aiked, did foreigners seek a residence
\ in this country ! He supposed it was either to
better their condition, or to live under a go vern
â  ment better and more free than that they had
left. But was it neceflary these persons should
, at once become entitled to take a part in the con
cerns of our government ? He believed it by
no means neceflary either to their happiness or
prosperity, and he was sure it would not tend
[ to the happiness of this country. If the native
citizens are not indeed adequate to the perform
ance of the duties of government,' ij might be
â¢ expedient to invite legislators or voters from
other countries to do that business for which they
themselves are not qualified. But if the people;
of the country, who owe their birth to it, are
adequate to all the duties of government, he
couid not fee for what reason strangers should be
admitted. Strangeis, who, however acceptable
they may be in other refpedls, could not have
the fame views and attachments with native citi
zens. Under this view of the fubjeil, he was
convinced it was an efiential policy, which-lay
at the bottom of civil society, that none but per
sons born in the country fhouM be permitted to
take a part in the government. There might
have be?n, Mr. H. acknowledged, individual
exceptions, and there may be again, to this gen
eral rule , but it was neceflary to make regula
tions general, and he believed the danger arising
from admitting foreigners generally to citizen
ship, would be greater than the inconveniences
arising 'rom debarring from citizenship, the most
deserving foreigners. He believed it would
have been well for this country, if the principle
contained in this amendment had been adopted
sooner ; he hoped it wouid now beadopted.
Mr. S. Smith believed it would be baft firft to
decide upon the resolution as reported ; if it was
negatived, the gentleman from S. Carolina might
then introduce his amendment as a fubftitnte.
i Toadopt the resolution as reported, would be,
t he believed, to agree upon an ex pojl faflo regu
lation. It could not be intended, he should sup
pose, to prevent persons who had refidedin this
country two or three years, under th* expecta
tion of becoming citizens at the end of five years
from that privilege,
i Mr. Champtiu fuÂ»geftcd whether, if this
amendment was adopted, it would not prevent
. foreigners, who ars not at prel'cnt citizens- of
the United States, from becoming officers in the
military departments of the United States. If
so, he believed it â¢rou'.d be proper te insert the
word civil before officers
Mr. Otis acknowledged that the objections of
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. S. Smith)
were, in some degree, f.-unded ; but there
i might be regulations introduced into the bill to
avpidthem. The present law, he believed, di
rcdls that persons shall give notice of their inten
tion of becoming citizens of the United'Stat'es.
Where this notice had been given, he thought
such persons should be excluded from the opera
tion of the law. These rtfo'utionj having only
been laid upen the table this morning, he wifti
ed, however, that thi committee might rife, in
order to afford a little time for consideration.
He wished to exclude all foreigners, which he
could coiiftitutionally exclude, from holding of
fices in the United States; but not to entrap such
as are in the way of becoming citizens'
Mr. Harper said, that having had it
to him that the constitution would not admit of
restraining the tatts in their admiflion of citizens,
he should withdraw hisamendment for the prelum,
until he had had an opportunity of examining the
constitution in this refpe<3.
The-motion being put for the committee to rift,
if was carried, and the committee rose rccordingly.
' The senate informed the house, by mefla<*e, that
I they had received information from the President
of the United States, that he had approved and
signed the aft providing an additional armament
for the protedion of the commerce of the United
States, and fer other purposes; aÂ»d the a<2 for the
eflabhfhment of a new department, under thÂ« de
nomination of rha Navy Department
The senate also informed the houfs, that they
have palfed a resolution authorizing Thomas Pinck
ney, late minister plenipotentiary in London, to
receive the prefenfs offered to him by tht courts of
Great Britain and Spain, to which they reqaeft
concurrence.
On motion Mr. Harper, the house went into
a committee of the whole on the bill to provide
enmpenfations for Marshals, Clerks, Jurors and
WitnefTes in the courts of the United States; and
after confiderahle discussion, the committee rose,
leave was refufed to them to fit again, and the bill
was recommitted to a committee of iixteen mem -
bers.
Mr. Gallatin then proposed the following in
ftruition te the commi'tee.
" Refolvtd, That the committee to whom this
bill is referred be inJlruOled to enquire into the an
nual official emoluments received by Mar/hals,
Clerks, and TMftriS Attornies, dijlinguijhing be
twixt fees paid by individuals, and what is
paid by the United States "
After confideraole opposition from Meflrs Den
nis, Bayard, Harper and Otis, this resolution was
carried, 36 to }s.
Mr. Harper presented the report from the com
mittee of ways and means, recorr,mending a direA
tax of two millions to he raised by a direiS tax up
on land, houses and slaves, which was yedcrday
re-committed. It was referred to a committee of
the whole, aadmade the order for Friday.
Mr. Gillefpie proposed a resolution for the adop
tion of the house, directing thÂ« committee oT com
merce and manufactures to enquire whether it it
not expedient lor the bctt; r fccurity of the navi

Your very humble servant,

r Honorable Mr. Wolcott, 1
Secretary of the Treasury. j
Treasury Department, Apri127,i798.
S 1 R,
In compliance with the letter which you
; did me the honour to write on the 21 ft in
ttant I herewith transmit, for the use of the
committee of Ways and Means, the follow
ing statements :
1 ft. A profpe&ive view of the revenue
and expenditure of the United States for the
entire year 1798, being an estimate of the
ordinary expenditure of the United States
under existing laws, and the probable pro
dudl of taxes of every kind.
2d. A statement of the aflual receipts
and expenditures of the United States du
ring the last quarter of the year 1797.
3d. A like statement of receipts and ex
penditures during the fir ft quarter of the
present year ; which though not finally ad
justed are piefumed to be correftly exhibited.
4th. A statement of the balances which
remained unexpended of certain appropria
tions for the current service on the 30th of
September, and 31 ft of December, 1797,
and 31ft of March, 1798.
sth. A statement of the loans obtained
from the bank of the United States, and
the sums which remain unpaid.
The statements before mentioned com
prize all the information required by the
r committee, and exhibit, in a connc&ed fe.
ries, the principel results of the operations
: of this department, subsequent to these da
ted in the documents which accompanied
. my report of the Bth of December, 1797,
t o the firft of the present month.
It is the duty of the commissioners of the
finking fund, to apply tÂ» the reduction of
the public debt all furpluffes of the revenue
of the United States, which remain at the
end of any calendar year,beyond the amount
of the appropriatious charged upou the fa'd
â  isvenuts, apd whieh during the feffioo ofCongress next thereafter, are not othefwife
appropriated, ar reserved by law. In purr
fuance of this dire&ion, upwards of one mil
lion and nine hundred thousand dollars were
applied of the proceeds of revenue, to the
reduftion of the public debt in the year 1797.
The sums which remained in the Treasury
were ntceffarily reserved for the current ser
vice i there cannot, therefore, be stated any
surplus of revenue, for the last year, as a
fund for new appropriations : the proba
ble surplus of the present yearabovethe sums
which will be required for the foreign debt,
the rcimhurfement of domestic fix per sent
stock, and the support of exiftiig eftablilh
ments, is stated in the account numbered,
I entertain no doubt that the bank of the
United States will readily ccjnfent to coti 1
tinue the loans which they have made to 1
the United Stats, and I feel enti e confi
dence 'hat funds can be obtained in antici
pation of any solid revenues which can be
established.
It is not easy to form a certain opinion
Â®f the sum, which can immediately be ob
tained on permanent loans, nor of the ex
pence which will attend them/ The 'Uni
ted States are unquestionably entitled to cre
dit on the most advantageous terms : the
installments in Holland which be ame due
prior to the present year, have*been dischar
ged ; effectual remittances for the sums
which will be payable before Deeembernex! ,
have been assured ; the sums of stock which
are offered for falc are not considerable j
there is no ground for dillryfting the public
ability or good faithâthe present prices of
stock are not considered as indications of di
ffruft,but of the high value cf money at the
present timeâassurances have been received
frore wealthy aÂ»d influential men. that they
will assist the United States with' new loans j
on reafonatje terms. On hefe grounds I
conceive myfelf juftifiable in expressing an
opinion, that the public credit will affo d
refotirces adequate to any exigency which
CStn be reasonably contemplated.
But to the fuccfefs of new loans and es
pecially as a security against a too common
abuse of the funding system, it is of the nt
moft importancetoeftablifh competent funds
for the reimbursement, in a reasonable time
of any capitals which may be borrowed. The
provision of a finking fund as mentioned in
your letter, ought therefore to be consider
ed as an iadifpenfible requisite.
I hjive the honor to be,
with perfeft refpeft,
Sir. your obedient servant

Extract of a letter from an American gen
tleman in London, dated March 14th,
T 79 8 -
" Denmark and Sweden have resolv
ed to arm a part of their naval forces
for the protection of their commerce ; i
and, with Prussia, have ordered their
envoys at Paris, to rCmoriftrate against
the late laws affedling the commerce of
neutral nations."
FIRE!
Lad Evening about n o'clock, a Fire
broke out in Kelfey's Livery Stables in
Church-alley: The range was 120 feet in
length, an 1 extended by (he weft wa 1 of
Fox and Dorfey's Sugar House. The flames
from the Stables ascended above the gable
end wail of the said Sugar House, which is
seven stories high. .There can be no doubt
the Sugar House was saved by its brick
walk, which are 21 inches thick, ap.dAy
'feverteen iron window fcuiters, which were
closed, as the time that a sheet of fire was
blazing for two hours against them. When
the fituatiou of the Stables, confined as they
were in the center of a large number of
brick houses and close to them, is consider
ed, it is astonishing that any exertions could
rescue the adjacent houses from total def- j
tnifta'onâyet so it is, that no other damage 1
was done, except to the old (table and a \
number of sheds which were wholly consu
med, in thirm nine or ten horses were burnt
to death and some carriages were destroyed.
The fire :s supposed to have been accidental.
CONGRESS.
Yeflerday, the House again went into a
committee of the whole 011 the bill from the
Senate, authorizing the President to raise a
Provisional Army ; when the firft additional
fettion proposing to authorize the calling out
of 20,000 of the militia detachments ordered
by the law of June lad, to be held in requisi
tion, for the purpose of training, Bcc. was
negatived, there being only 11 votes for it.â
The second feftion recommended, proposing
the loan of artillery "to any militia corps eft*-
blifhed by laÂ»v, was agreed to ; so was the
third tor loaning field artillery, arms, and ac
coutrements from the arsenals of the United
States to any portion of the militia called into
service, which shall be deficient; the fourth,
providing for the purchase of caps, swords,
and pistols for 4000 cavalry, to be loaned to
such parts o'i the United States as (hall want
them, was agreed to, and 200,000 dollars to
be appropriated for carrying that and other
purpo(es un 'er the aft, into execution. The
fifth and last section, recommended, for ex
empting soldiers from arrest was also agreed
to. The committee then proceeded to consi
der the bill as amended when a motion was
made by Mr. Harrison, to strike out in the
third feftion the words authorizing jlie.Pr.efi
dent to appoint the
"iuE i-uipb, vviJiCTT -jiro
pofes the President shall accept the services
of. Mr. Varnum moved to (Irilce out the
whole feclion, on the ground of its being an
unconflitutional provision. This motion oc
casioned considerable debate, and the com
mittee rose., without taking a question uponit.

MR. FENNO.
Rejoicing to fee my country returning
to the true American fpiiit, from the base
and submissive fcntiments to which the fac
tion of fools and knaves would have degraded
it I fend you, with pleasure, a copy of an
address to the President, now signing by the
militia officers of this state, with our soldierly
and worthy Governor at their head. It is
calculated to maintain the honour that the
militia of New-Jersey have already-acquired,
and that was so justly pledged to govern
ment in the address from Princeton, K'tngflon,
Montgomery, and Windsorâ¢ The example
deserves to be imirated by the military of
every state in the union.
To THE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
sir,
THE Commander in Chief, the General
Officers, the General Staff aud Field Offi
ceis of the Militia of the state of New-Jer
sey, feel, in common with their numerous
Fellow-Citizens, who have addressed you
in the present critical situation of our na
tion, and most cordially join them in ex
pressing to you/heir high approbation of
your conduft in the management of its
Foreign Concer s. and their indignation for
the insult offered to the honor and indepen
dence of the American People.
We come not, Sir, to dilateâWhether
Peace can be preferred with the fafety of
our national dignity, or whether an appeal
is to be made to arms, are questions en
truftedto those in wh f<* patriotism we con
fide, and according to their decision we .shall
always be prepared to aÂ£l.âBut, Sir, at
this eventful period, we deem it our duty,
and we feel i a pleasure, refpeiStfully to ap
proach our Commander in Chief, and to
make him a foletrin proffer of our Lives and
in thfc service of our Country,
It is not, Sir, for Soldiers to boast; but
we k ow the troops whom wfphave the ho
nour to commandâwe have been eye-wit
nesses to their ardent zeal in the cause of
Freedomâwe have been their companions
in many toils and many fuffering3, and if
our beloved Country calls, we shall again
cast the eye of confidence along their em
battled rinks.
Let our enemies flatter themselves that
we are a divided peopleâln New-Jersey,
Sir, with the exception of a few degraded
and a few deluded chara&ers, to wliofe per
foas and to whose services the invading foe
shall be welcome, from the moment of their
arrival, and whom we engasje to convey in

there is but ONE VOlCE^âand that is

Honour. , tf
For the. Gazette of the United States.
I am an old man, near seventy. I afTifted
in gaining the independence of my country.
My military apparatus I haves arefully pre
served to be handled again, fhowld the folly
of tyrants make it necessary, and 'in ready
any moment when called on, to join a corps
of old veterans, and, at the risk of life, to
do all that I am able for the political salva
tion of America. Liberty or Death !
For what is life wheft placed iti competition
with heavenly liberty ?-I am happy in feeing
the youth of Philadelphia glowing with love
of country, and so alert and ready in offering
their personal services at th.s momentous
crisis. I doubt not they will immediately
submit to be disciplined, and to learn the
military art ; and if the counten nces of
these young men be a true index of their
minds, as I believe it is, certain I am they
are iincere in their voluntary profeffions,
and may God speed their exertions ! The
present laudable spirit I hope will pervade
every slate in the union, and enkindle in
each .heart the sacred fire of liberty. My
country has been crriel'y treated by a pow
erful, unjust nation. A strong- blustering
man may impose, Â« ith impunity, on a weak
man : when po help i; at hand, he rnuft
then crouch under superior forceâHow
mean and cowardly is fucli a bravado ? I
did hope nations would have afted more
honorably; but, alas, how have we been
deceived ! When power is in their hands,
they are sure to tyrannizeâThe present
rulers of France do not aft justly to this
country âHad the firft rulers lived till thiÂ«
day, affairs would have been otherwise
Gratitude, probably, would have inspired
their fouls with genuine friendship and love
towards a people from whom they caught
the flame of libertyâthey were llaves be
fore that time. Artful Jesuits have been
sent through the land to propagate their
principlesâdeftruftive to America; âand
much has been bui'< on their success ;* but
vain are all their expeftations. Our govern
ment is a good oneâWe want no French
novelties, and will not be filched out of our
moneyâAmerica must and will be inde
pendent of all the nations on earth. We
are not effeminated Italians, Venitians, or
of
renown : and of this, those wtonce called
allies, at the capture of Cornwallis, were
eye-witnesses. What! part with our birth
right ?âforbid it Heaven ! Let U9 deter
mine rather to die in the last ditch !
A COLUMBIAN.
MR. FENNO,
THE natural result of the abuse of the liberty of
the press on the part of the Jacobins and Democrats,
has long since been fore Teen, but the conlequences
have but just began to ripen into general notice, and
feeling.
Freneau, Greenleaf, Adams and Bache gave rife to
this fubflitiition of Opprobrium and inve&iYe, for
reason and argument. It hough there were attempts
to defeat their purposes, by honeit endeavours to bring
them to a sense of decency and propriety, all would
not do.âDelphi ring of any other mode of defence,
fevcral writers have receutty entered the lifts, and de
feated these miscreants in their own way: But as every k
well-educated man cannot descend to such weapons,
duels have been fought., and blood foilt on these occa
sions. The Champion of audacious Giles, and 3.
Livingfton, have each destroyed their,federal am&go
nifti, who died in defence of virtue, decency and their
country. Thus stands the account at present,âDr.

HARTFORD, (Conne<Slieut) May to.
Yesterday, being the day preceeding Eleflion,
arrived in town his honor Governor Trumbull.
By his particular request his horse-guards pro

The cerem ny on that occafton being new,
beautiful and highly expressive of the rerpefl
and attachment of all clafles of people to thÂ«
ruler; of their choice, we lay an account ps it
before the puhl'c.
Ihe shipping with their <a)Jori flj'ifij? were
formed in two lines extending across the river,
-one above and the other below the ferry The

(hip, formed it. the center of the upper line ful
ly dressedâon the governor's a-rival wi'h his
fu<t on the east bank of the river, a salute of
cannon was fired from the admiral âthree boats
prepared for the purpose, manned with fifteen
sea captains (in allusion to the fifteen {laces on
the American flandard) brought over, palfing
through the lines, the governor and his suit, â
the officers of his guard ajid.Uie band of music ;
the boat carrying the I'overunr and his suit crofT

A procefiiw being then formed, tlie governor
was efforted, by his guards, a band of mjilte,
and a numerous body of refpeflihle tfirhen*
through town tb major Ridley's tavern. On h : 9
arrival there, a salute was fired by his guards,
which wasiftfwered by the admiralâthe whole

ALBANY May i, 1798.
There were some who filtered theliifeves
with an idea that the communications of our
eorrimiffioners .on embassy at France would
produce complete union, Sc a universal &
unhesitating approbation of the conduit of

and to declare that America ought to hum

in any fte s to maintain the trampled upon
privileges which have been her boastâand
the insulted rights of the people, which in

are at war with order, because it checks the

It was dated a ft~rt 'ime since, that the difor

f-iifls jullificatory of foi n.er rrfiilien* :
Extract of a letter from a gentlemaH in Connecti

" The few diforganizers among us have panted,
struggled, and politically expired.âWith all their
