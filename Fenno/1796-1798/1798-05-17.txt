NOTICE.
HAVING observed an advertifemert of C.
Gullager, in terms derogatory of our pro-
abilities, we have to request the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artifls ; but to
decide upon the merits of Â«ach by a codiparifon ot
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
univcrfally adopted by them to invabdate the ta
lents of ellablifhed artists, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrossing that business which
their profefiional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opinion must
govern, we flatter ourselves that the work execut
ed by us will convince them of our great superio
rity over Mr. Gullager in every branch of por
trait and ornamental painting, and shew thenecef
fity of judging for themselves.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
THURSDAY MAY 3.
DEBATE ON THF A4.11N R!/. L.
(Concluded from \cJUr.lay 3 Gazette. J
Mr. Venable did not wish to (hew any
particular encouragement to foreigners ; but
if persons thought they could live happier
here, than in their own country, he should
not objeft to their making the change.
He could not agree to the amendment.
Stippofe hostility was committed upon the
property of any of our citizens by France,
fnch hostility might Bot be a fufficient cause
for placing all our commercial citizens in
a situation of having their property seized.
Many cafe* might be deemed hostility by
the President which ought not to go to cut
off all communication betwixt the citizens
of the two countries ; in such a cafe if any
of the citizens of France should be taken
np here, it would produce a similar coqduft
towards our citizens in that country, which
would be allowed to be a serious evil.
Mr. Sewall again urged as an objeft ion
to this amendment, the conftitutioÃal pow
er of congress to declare war. Th o many
circumstances of insult and aggression, he
allowed had been experienced by this coun
try from a foreign power, which might
have been understood by other nations as
war, and might havi been so considered by
this country ; yet as it is an aft of congress
to declare war, we could not be considered
as at war, until congress declared us to be
in such a state, except war was declared a
gainst us. This provision was not intended
for any particular cafe, but as a general
provision. which might at any time be call
ed forth by proclamation. It should, there
fore, be as well guarded and definite as pos
sible. If the words proposed were introdu
ced* the proposition would be rerdered too
indefinite ; and the President might pro
ceed to fend aliens from this colinjry, and
of course canfe our citizens in a foreign
country to be sent from thence, or to be
imprisoned, and their property eonfifcated,
at a time when congress might not judge it
expedient to go to war. France, said he,
has now done towards the United States
what might be considered as hostility. Snp
pofe we pass a law which calls upon the
President to aft, what ought the President
to dn > Was he to determine the point whe
ther France has au'thorifed hostilities again!!
the United States ? If so, }ie would
dowbtlefs fay she had, and in consequence
every Frenchman in this country will be li
able to be removed out of the country, and
our citizeps who happen to be in France
will be placed in the fame situation. Mr.
S. said, though it might be proper for con
gress to declare this to be the state of the
country, he thought it would be improper
to give the Prefidknt this power. He wish
ed the power of fending persons out of the
country to be confinedjto such cases as were
particularly dangerous, which were includ
ed,in the resolution without this amend
ment. As to foreigners guility of crimes
against the United States, they ought to
be apprehended and punished according to
the â¦viftiug: \ttvri . ttfe "pi-efeiit leg*****..,!
was not pointed at them.
Mr. Otis said, as his colleague had chos
en to call indefinite, hemuft
excuse him When he said he considered the
resolution without it, as trifling and inef
feftual, and argued a timidity which ought
not at this time to be shewn by this coun
try ; and bad he not been thoroughly ac
quainted with the uprightness of intention
and the purity of the motives of his col
league, he should really have doubted whe
ther he was sincerely desirous of exer ing
41l the energies of the country in her de
fence ; but being perfiuded of these, he.
would suppose that he himfelf was wrong
in his conceptions on this occasion, and
make a few observations upon what ground
he formed his opinion.
He believed it would not be proper to
wait until predatory excursions were made
âuntil the enemy wa3 landed in our coun
try, or until what shall be considered as
threatening or perpetrating invasion appear
ed, before any steps were taken on the fub
jeft now under consideration. He wa3 of
opinion that when an enemy authorised hos
tilities, that was the time to take,up that
crowd of spies and inflammatory agents
which overspread the country, like the lo
custs of Egypt, and who were continually
attacking our liberties. The provision
would doubtless be exercised with discre
tion. There might be Frenchmen in this
city and others (and he doubted not there
were) who were peaceable, well disposed
persons, and against whom it never could be
thought necefTary to exercise this power ;
but there were other persons* not only in
this city, but in others, who have not only
been extremely instrumental in fomenting
hostilities against this country, but also in
alienating the affeftions of our own citizens,
and it was men of this description whom he
wished to remave from the country.
It is proposed by this resolution to give
the the power to
when the country from which they come
shall threaten an invasion. Some believe
that this country is at present threatened
with an invasion and with a ravage of our
coasts, yet others fay that the difpatchei
from ouf envoys only confiflfof unauthoris
ed conventions with X, Y and Z, and
therefore not to be relied upon. Mr. O
thought this a more indefinite power than
that which he proposed to vest in the Pre
sident. His opinion was that something
ought to be done which should strike these
people with terror ; he did not wish to give
them an opportunity of executing any of
their fedicious and malignant purposes ; he
did not desire, in this leafon of danger, to
boggle about flight fotms.nor to pay refpeft
to treaties already abrogated, but to seize
these persons wherever they could be found
carrying on their vile ptirpofc-s. Without this
every ihmg else which h .d been done in the
line of defence, would amount to nothing.
Mr. M'Dowiil fticJ, from the observa
tions of the gentleman jofl fat down, it
would appear that hostilities h d already
Commenced betwixt this country and France.
If this is the cafe, and the house knew it,
why not fay so and make preparations ac
cordingly ? Why pafsafts fitted for a (late
of war, without declaring that that is the
state of the country ? [Mr. Qtis said. if
the gentleman from N. Carolina would bring
forward a proposition of this kind, He should
be ready to vote for it.J Mr. MO. cx
pefted the gentleman was prepared for war,
and therefore that he would have brought
forward a lefolution tft thateffeft
The gentleman from S Carolina {Mr.
Rutledge) had not considered this amend
ment with his usual accuracy, when he said
that the adoption of it would prove an en
couragement to'foreigners to come to this
country. He thought't could not be ve
ry flattering encouragement to foreigners, to
tell them "if you come here, and your
government commits any aft of hostility a
gainst the citizens of this country, you will
be liable to be imprifoncd, or f.nt out of
the country."
But it was said the country swarmed with
spies and seditious persons If this was the
cafe, he (hould be glad if gentlemen would
point them out ; if they could, he should
be as glad as they to take measures against
them. A person in Kentucky had been al
luded to. Under the author ty of Genet, he
believed, some commissions had been iffutd ;
but he did not believe that any had been is
sued since. It was also known that there
had been another minister of another coun
try. who had adopted a similar praftice. He
still remained here, andmiight still be carry
ing on his mischievous schemes. .[The
Speaker said the rcfolution was general.]
It was said that hostilities having been com
mitted on our commerce by France, they
would authorize a war with France (though
Great-Britain had conducted herfelf much
in the fame way, and nothing was said as to
her) and that therefore the President ought
to be empowered to fend all Frenchmen out
of the country, however peaceably they
might be residing here, if he thought pro
per to do so. This he could not consent to
It was too large a power. He {hould there
fore vote against the amendment.
Mr.- Sitgreaves considered this as one of
theeffentialfeaturesof the system of defence
about which Congress had been employed
during the present fefiion, in order to enable |
us to meet the dangers which threaten us.
He believed, that though it might be ex
tremely wife and prudent to enter into regu
lations for securing our peace at all funure
periods, yet it was most particularly their
duty to concert measures of defence and
proteftion in our present exigencies.- He
believed the business of defence would be
very imperfeftly done, if they confined their
operations of defence to land and naval
forces, and seglefted to destroy the canker
worm which is corroding in the heart of the
country. There could be no question on
this fubjeft. It is well understood by every
member of the community. There is no
occasion for fpecific proof that there are a
great number of aliens in this country from
imnoil wiui wnu... i.ave at prcieiu
alarming difference* ; that there are emissa
ries amongst ns, who have not only fomented
our differences with that country, but who
have endeavoured to create divisions amongst
our own citizens. They are, said he, affidu
oufty employed at this moment, and it is
much to be lamented that there exists no
authority to restrain the evil. It was there
fore peculiarly incumbent on Congress to
add to their other measures of defence, such
powers as will protest the country against
this evil. He believed this could not be
effefted without the adoption of some such
principle as that under confidera'tion. If
the power was too limited, the enemy would,
not be met. There could be no difficulty,
Mr. S, said, in point of right. All under
stand the right to which aliens are entitled
by the laws of nations. They are no more
than the rights of hospitality, and this right
varies according as the relation in which the
country from which they come, and that in
which they reside, is peaceable, or other
wise.
We do not owe to the citizens of France
resident in this country (since France had
been mentioned) the fame hofpitalitieswhich
we owe to thofc foreigners who are alien
friends ; though he confeffed there were
rights of hospitality which would not be
done in time of war, as it
refpefts alien merchants, which were pro
vided fcr in this resolution. And except
a person had an aftual agency in defigna
which would endanger the peace of the
country, though he was ordered out of the
country, a free p'affage would be given to
himfelf and effefts ; and if aftua'ily engaged
in defigr.s against the coufitry, there would
be a strong necefiity for restraining the
liberty of any such persons.
It had been well alked, whether we ought
to wait till the enemy landed, before any
measures were taken to remove persons
from the country, who would be ready to
join them by thoufand3, or take advantage
of the knowledge we hare of their hostile
intentions towards us ? He thought there
could be no doubt on the fubjeft. He
knew there were aliens in this country of
valuable charafters, whose acquaintance
ought to be cherished and cultivated.
Such men would be in no danger from the
proposed provision. It was meaHt only to
Operate against faftions and bad men, who
abuse the liberty allowed them of residing in
this country, and these all must fee the
necessity of attending to. France, said he,
will not admit an alien of any description to
reside in her country without a card of hos
pitality, and shall Congress scruple to go
the length of this amendment ? He hoped
not.
Mr. Allen laid, he would move an amend
ment which would fupercede that under
consideration, by making the resolution ex
tend to all aliens in this country. He wiflied
to retain none of the reftraiuts which are in
the present resolution. Nothing but his
rcfpect for the gentleman who made this
repoit (Mr. Sewall) would have prevented
him from fufpefting that there existed some
latent and mischievous design in this busi
ness. The proportion" goes upon the sup
position that none but the citizens of a par
ticular nation can be dangerous to this
country ; whereas be believed that there are
citizens of several ather countries who are
as dangerous, who have dispositions equally
hostile to this country with the French.
He believed more so. He believed the
whole country was aware of this. Mr. A.
alluded to the vast number of naturalizations
which lately took place in this city to sup
port a particular party in a particular elec
tion. It did not appear to him necessary to
have the exercise of this power depend upon
any contingency, such as a threatning of in
| vafion, or war, before it could be exercised.
! He wished the president t haveit atalltimes.
He moved an amendment to this effeft,
which went to enable the President to re
move, at any time, the citizen of any foreign
country whatever, not a citizen, regarding,
the treaties with such countries. If gen
tlemen took a view of the different states of
Europe which had been subdued by the
French, Mr. A said, they would not think
it either wife or prudent to wait for an fn
vafion, or threatened invasion, before this
power was put in execution. Venice,
Switzerland and Rome, have been overcome
by means of the agents of the French nation, ,
at a time when they were in a much less
alarming situation than we are at present ;
and the firft disturbance in thofc countries,
was made the pretext for open hostilities.
This has been the effeft of diplomatic agency,
of emissaries within Â»nd without, who have
bred quarrels, for the purpose of forming
pretexts for mealures which have led to the
subjugation of those countries. He be
lieved there were citizens in this country,
who would be ready to join a foreign power
in aflifling to subjugate their country.â
What paffcd before our eyes, and every day
offended our ears, were so many proofs of
it. Not many weeks ago open threats were
made to disturb the peaee of the country.
He hoped, therefoje, with all these things
before them, the amendment which he had
proposed would be agreed to.
Mr. Sewall said, being one of the com
mittee who made this report, he supposed
he fell in for a (hare of that censure which
had been so liberally cast upon it by his col
league and the gentleman last up from Con
nefticut. The gentleman from Connefticut
had thought fit to condemn the committee
for not having considered cases which were
not referred to them. It was not referred
to them to consider what France had done
in all other countries with whom (he had had
disputes, or what this country fhonld do
against France; but what should be done
with refpeft to aliens in this country gene
rally. Civil policy regarded aliens in two
lights, viz. alien friends and alien enemies.
He did not contemplate the making of this
country a wall against all aliens whatever ;
or thst no alien should come here without
being fubjeft to an arbitrary authority, such
as is tothe French !*;â¢â**>---
"irrtÃTSnfltente of such a power as shall be
able to place every alien in the country in a
dungeon, was necessary to quiet the fears
and apprehensions of the genMeman from
Connecticut, he should not be willing to
grant it. Indeed, it appeared to him that
the fears and apprehensions of that gentle
man arose from some defeft in his own or
ganization, or difeaie of his body (which
he believed might be better cured by the
physician, than by any thing else) than
from any real giound of alarm.
What, said Mr. S. is to be feared from
the refidene'e of aliens amongst us ? Any
thing to ruin the country ? He acknow
ledged many inconveniences arose from tSia
circumstance, but more from our own un
natural children, who, in the bosom of their
parent, conspired her deftruftion. But did
gentlemen with to increase the evil by faying
that persons born in foreign countries howe
ver regular and orderly their conduft may
be, shall be liable to be imprifoncd, or sent
out of the country, but that citizens of this
country, howeverreprehenfibletheir conduft
should have nothing to fear ? The committee
were not called uponlo report on this point.
He was himfelf of opiniou that snore ought
to be done, and that aliens from any coun ry
(hould be liable to be removed, in cafe of
misbehaviour ? but he did not wi(h to leave
the business wholly withthe President of the
United States, The committee had reported
only in part; they had yet to consider what
steps would be proper to be taken against ali
ens,orcitizens guiltyof criminal proceedings;
but whengentlemen saw the addresses which
were pouring in from all parts of the coun
try, in favour of the measures which had
been purfuedby government, and expreflions
of determination to fuppatt every measure
in defence of their country, was any thing
to be feared from a handful of aliens ? It was
a reproach tothe country to suppose it. If
aliens were found to be guiltyof seditious
praftices, let them be reftrifted ; but not
placed under an arbitrary authority. He ne
ver wilhed to feethegovernment of the coun
try in such a situation, Our situation, said
Mr. S. is not like that of the Direftory of
Franse, whoraone of the Rationsare curling;
wehave, therefore, no laecefiity forthe strong
measures adopted by them. But if gentle
men were determined to arrest every alien in
the country, let them bring forward a reso
lution of that kind ;. but in making regula
tions against alien enemies, let us not sub
jest every foreigner who comes tothis coun
try however well intended he may be, to the
fear of a dungeon or removal. If gentlemen
wished to make the resolutions more gene
ral, and to provide for cases, in which war
was firft declared by this country, though
he had before said he did not think it necess
ary, he had no objeftion to indulge them,
by inserting the words, â Â« between which
and the United States there Jhall exijl a decla
redjlate of -war." But unlets the United
States were inclined to affutne the charaft
ef"of the i urks or Arabs, fiich a regula
tion a 9 was recommended by the gentleman
from Conneftfcut could not be adopted.
Mr. Allen had no particular anxiety that the re
solution fltould pais to the extent which he had pro
k a S entUmen d 'd not think it necessary,
he (hould not perfilt i n it. He w a! sorry thr gen
tleman frem Maffachuletls (hould have discovered.
in him any difeifc ot body which was capable of
pv.ng.nre to personal fear. Me believed he pos
sessed as little as mod men. As to the necefli'vof
the mealure which he had proposed, he would
mention two nrcumftances which led him tothiak
it necoffary. A person in this city, who has too
relpedahle a (landing, and; who is doing too
much biifinefs in it, has that ha wilhes
to fee a French army land in this country, and
that he would do all in his power to farther their
lan ling. He had heard nearly the fame thiq front
another quarter. He thought, therefore, Oiat
there ought toexift a power whirl; (hould be able '
to lend such persons out of the country. Not that
he was himfelf either afraid of being assassinated,
ar having the city burnt. But the chairman of the
committee' had laid, that this fuSjeft was yet be
fore them. 1 his hÂ« *iid not know, before the
gentleman said so; for having made.a report upon
the fubjea hefuppofed they had done all they in
tended to dÂ» upon it.
Mr. Dana wa> oppoftd to this amendment. He
thought the provisions of this rcfolution ought to
be msde definite, as it contemplated regulatians
which congref; would be willing to have in exift
| ence at all future tim-s; and though the princi
ples upon which the refidencc of nlieni was regu
j lated : laid down in the law of nation*, as it relate!
to monarchical governments,' yet in this country,
: A f " VCTci^nt y the pee pie is by
the confhtution in cougrefj, these regulations mnft
be fix*d by law. The danger of war with which
the country was threatened had forced the fuSieA
I upon coagref.at rhis time, and this being the cafo,
he was dcfirous of adapting some regulations ot a
permanent nature refpeding it If any ether re
gulations were neccflary with refped to our pre
lent situation with France, hetheught they ought
to be made special and temporary.
Mr. All n withdrew his amendment; when
Mr. Otis's,proportion returned, thÂ« t-uyfiion on
which was put and negatived, 35 to 17'.
Kir. made the motion which heb.*dfugÂ«
gelled, when he was laft'up viz to add the words,
" bet-ween which aad 4be United States there Jhall exijl
a Jiate of ivar."
Mr. Otis hoped tb Â« motion would not prevail,
25 though; it "Vj&t: isjltiys tlieiofulKtiijn Â«f
every gooij feature Inch i* at present po(T (Ted â 
for it would prnvaut rii? ex-.rcife of the power in
any other cafe than in a flats of war, an ! as all the
expreliions were future, it fuppofedthat such a state
did hot extft at present. He concerted he set 110
value at all upon any law, unless it was adopted to
the present esigencies-*)f the country. Gentlemen
might talk as they pleased about permanent regu
lations ; he believed they ought to provide aÂ«ainft
thereGdenca of alien enemies exiftmg in thti bosom
of the country, as the root of all the evil which we
are at present experiencing, and he could nut con
cÂ«ive any mode of doi.gthis, hut by applying the
remedy immediately to the evil. Gentlemen talk
about p, declaration of war. No such thing scarce
ly ever piecedes war. War and the declaration of
waÂ» come together, like thunder and lightning.
Indeed, if France finds (he can enfeeble our coun
cils by refraining to declare war, and that wawilt
take 110 measures of effectual defence until this is
done, it is probable (hs will uot declare it, but
continue to annoy us as at present He hercfore
thought if the fcleft committee had not been ripe
for making a report fully on this fubjetS, they
ought to have delayed it until they were. '
M'r.Sewall explained.
Mr. Sitgreaves fait}, he had fuffei;ed Ho little
lrom frding the difference of opinion whiih exist
ed betwixt the chairman 'of the comm'ittee who
made the report on this fubjeit, and gentlemen who
usually voted with him. He saw ibat difference of
opin<on was essential and radical. He did nÂ»t mean
to go into the fubjecl.but merely to make a pro
ursrafs upon it it
was to add the words, Â« or Jballdeclare ho/lUity aeaui
the United State,:'
Mr Davis move d apoflponement of thiqucf
tion till to morrow, as he wiflied timpto consider
of it. He had some doubt as to the cohfcitutional
ity ot such a provision.
Mr. Sitgreaves had no obje>9ion to a poflpone
rr.ent, if time was wantÂ«d ler eotifideration ; but
he could not fee on what constitutional ground this'
motion could be objected to.
Mr. Gallatin was in favor of the postpone.
ment. He would suggest to his colleague that
part of the eonftitution which might be in the
way of this motion. A diilindtion was made by
it betwixt actual hojlillty and war.
It it had only gone to have made a difference
between declared and adlual war, by striking
out the word declare, it Would have removed
the objeilion. If there be a difference between
3 state of war and a state of atifual hnftihty,
there is also a difference in the relation in which
alien fut'jetfls of a nation with whom we are at
war, and thole of a nation with whom we are
in a fla'eof aiflual hostility If this diftinftion
be coireft, by taming to the 9th feci ion of the
eonftitution, it is found that the migration of
such persons as any ot, the slates shall think pro
per to admit, (hall not be prohibited by Congrefa
prior to the year 1808 He understood it, how
ever, to be a found principle that alien enemies
might be removed, although the emigration of
persons be nÂ« prohibited by the Hates, by a prin
ciple which exifled prior to the eonftitution, and
coeval with the law of nations. The queftios
was, therefore, whether the citizens or fubjedts
of nations in adiual hostility, can be considered
as alien enemies. The term aSual bojlility is
vague in its nature, and wou'dintroduce doubt
as to its true import. He should, therefore, he
in favor cf the postponement, â¢ xcept the mover
would consent to have the word declare ftruclc
out in the way he had mentioned.
The qneftion for a postponement was put and
carried : and the two firll refactions were re
ferred to the feletfl committee, to report a bill
or bills accordingly.
Mr. Pinckney, from thecommittee to whom
was referred the memorial and temortftrande of
the legislature of the flateof Georgia, made i
report. The memorial states that the (late of
Georgia obtained from the creek Indians a eef
fion of the county of Talliffee, bur that the
United Srates, at the treaty of New-York ha;l
eeded it back to the Indians, they therefore pray
compenfatioii. The committee recomilicnds
compensation ts be made. The report was
committed for ThUrfday. Adjourned,
Fridayâmay 4.
Mr New presented certain refoluiisns of a
meetingof citizens at Tapahannock, in F.ffexcoun
ty, stating that a war with France would produce
injuries couutlefs in number ; that the public knew
of 110 just cause ot war but fclf preservation ; and
that they trull; therefore, that every means will !>Â«
useÂ» tcpreferve the ceuntry in peace.
Jn motion of Mr. Harper the house took up the.
amendment of the senate to the bill refpefling the
compenfatioii of clerks, which the senate inOli up
on. Mr H. moved to recede from thir difagree
