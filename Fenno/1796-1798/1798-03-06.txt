TUESDAY EVENING, Maich 6.
To the Editor Â»f the JnittJ States Gazette.
No. 11l
SIR.
At a time when the picaroons of Great-Bri
tain toek and detained tHeui for id
judipatioÂ«; though-failing under a neutral fl*g,
it ill readily he that the antifede
raU in this eourftry, hoik in cÂ»nÂ«refÂ» out,
clamoured aloi'd for war. Measures were even
taken to plunge us istÂ« that fit-aation not by
O'jrfelves.kut in conjunction with the Frenchâ
that we mii:ht unitedly go and -t 'oaftife Great-
Britain. This bsfineiii was managei so art
fully as to enlist the palAÂ»nÂ« ot many well
meaning mm, before they had reflrfled npdi'?
the Unprailicablityoffucha Qulxntte-enterpi ;ze.
And when Prcfident Wafliinjrton thought prop
cr to try to accommodate the differences _be
twetn<tl|e two countries by pacific Rtgaciaiio*,
aid nominated an envof for that pu' pose, the
aptifederals reviled himâhis judgment, his pa
triotism, his integri'y, were ail arraigned and
condemned, like " fufpe&ed" persons before a
Frtri'Ch revolutionary trjWunaJ. No calamity
eould have befallen Mr. Jay fuffici-'nt to gratify
their malevolent hearts. Ottcn did they -a ifh
that th'e Hlgennes might catch him, and inflidl
on him ibe ftrvi-reft torments. Often HM thty
wilh thatthe Britilh wou 3 canfinr him in an iten
i head-rale and collar, (as the fouth>rners do their
ret'racflory negroes) and feed him On bran and
w'ater. Oft n did they wish that Heaven would
hiirl its lightening in vengeance at himT that
he might never reach land. These things I
have riesrd ; heard them from democrats anr*
were it nec< ITary, I could nime the persons, the
timei ind (he phces. But, as they are faft de
eTinuig. I hope they will (horty fink into irre
mediable tonmfginefsâ at leafi, no voluntary
of mine shall ever contribute to rescue them
from olilivion ; even to consign them to their,
better merited infamy. Â»
War was then the defirible objeA with the
benevolent,the difintsrelled antifederalsâit was j
vocifecaterfin the hall of the democratic society
at Philadelphia From that dark cell it iflued in
opposite dire<\ions ; it- bent its ciurfe north and
south, flyirtgwith (he rapidity of lightening, un
til jt had reached the remotest bounds of our
|Rnd ; and, like the deTlroying angel, it mark
ed its proprefs with fire and blood. Nothing
would fitisfy it em but 3 war v with Great Bri
tain- The latter, however, liftmed to pattfic
terms ; our d-fferencca wer; pacifically and hon
ourably adj'jfled,, and oui antifederals still kept
up. the clamour. But the times are now chang
ed. Great-B r itain is indemnifying and remu
nerating thole from wham Pic- made illegal cap
tures and France has aflumed the right of dis
posing of our commerce. She has taken from

let us luok a iirtlc faither. What has became

the Bntifii, was then the avowed reafen for go

for Mr. Nicholas. But, fiy they, what (ha- a
we gain by going to war ? (Why was not thi- '
enquiry advanced three years ago ?) 1 will un
dertake the anftt-er. We (hall get rid of Frecic! r<
influence ; we (hall get rid of French, men ; wc
â¦hall get a protection for our commerce ; an;
we shall silence the violent philipics against our
constituted authorities, which our antifederala
are incessantly difgorg ng upon them. BÂ»t how
is it that the antifedtrals are so changed with
refpeift to war ? Tilt question is worthy of be
ing repeated. The truth is, they are not chang h

their mother, their filler, their ntirfe, their dear j

When it had to fear the capture of vef

thus to introduce it,by cunning,by. fraud or

This meflage waÂ£ ordered to be printed I
and committed to a committee of the whole
on the ftateof the Unidn.
The house again resolved itfclf into a
committee of the whole, on the bill to pro
vide the means of Intercourse with foreign
nations ; when Meflrs. Reed, R. Williams
and Bayard spoke against the araÂ«ndment,
and Mr. W. C. Claibiyne in favor of it.
At theconclufipn of Mr. Bayard's speech
(which was very long) thequeftion wasloud
ly called for.
Mr. Brent roseÂ» and was about commen
cing some observations in reply to Mr. Bay
ard, when the cry of Â« the qiieftion" was
still continued. He fat down, and some
conversation took place for and against the
committee's rising ; but on Mr. Brent's
faying he did no wi(h the committee to rife
on his account, the question for riling was
put and negatived.
The , queflion was then put upon Mr.
Nicholas's amendment, anfl negatived, 52
to 48.
A motion was then made for the commit
tee to rife, and ask leave to fit again, which
was negatived.
The bill was proceeded with.
â¢ Mr. S. Smith moved to (Irike out certain
words, and to insert otheis 10 this effect .
" That the President of the United State 3
shall not allow to any minister plenipotenti
ary to France, Great-Britain or Spain,
more than 9,000 dollars per annum, nor to
any otherminifter plenipotentiary more than
.6,000 dollars."
This amendment was negatived, there be
ing only 47 votes in its favour.
The blanks in the bill weTÂ« next to be
filled ; the firft, which was the permanent
allowance, was filled with 40,000 dollars ;
the next, which was an extraordinary ap
propriation for this year, with 28,650 dol
lars. Before the latcer sum was agreed u
pon,
Mr.Livingft on enquired whether the sum I
of betwixt 2 and 3,000 dollars, which he
thought had been lavished away, said to be
expended on persons taking leave from this
country, was included in the incidental ex
pences which were contained under this
head. He thought such an expenditure of
money forbidden by the constitution.
Mr. Harper believed the insidental ex
pences mentioned in the. estimate were ex
pences of our ministers abroad.
Mr. Nicholas underltocd that three Se
cretaries were at present allowed the mission
at present is France, He thought this was
- 1 â - -------
had thought tht law would not have war
ranted the praftice; examining it, he
supposed it did. / k,.
Mr. Harper said, every minister employ
ed was entitled to a fecretaiy, the President
had accordingly appointed one to each, and
he could pot fee ; upon what ground- the
hoiife'could object to appropriating for their
salaries. , .
Mr. Nicholas aufwered, that as the law
admitted of it, he lhould not o'.jea to the
appropriation ; but he should move an a
mendiaent to prevent more lhau one .ecre
tary. to a mission in future.
The committee then rofeand reported toe
bill with the amendments ; which being ta
ken up in the house and agreed to, Mr. Ni
cholas renewed his amendment to limit- the
salaries of Ministers Plenipotentiary to Lbn
don, Paris and Madrid, te 9.000 dbllavs a

ar.d that the veflel was supposed to have

the preceding night, as the wind blewflrong i

The veflel and cargo were 'principally in

there is but too much cause tÂ« believe, have
