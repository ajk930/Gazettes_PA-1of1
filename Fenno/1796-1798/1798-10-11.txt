The late prevailing sickness, may be m
said to be far dissipated, that no fears need w
be entertained by any one of returning to o
town. Few new cases occur; and the town 11
is as cleanly as ever it was. Several families f(
have returned ; and others are coming in. ti
From Amsterdam, July 10. o
"On account of, 4 the difficulties fubfilling tt
between your States and France, which will tl
1 mod likely tend to a final rupture,' it is e
lately reported that a general embargo will f<
be laid in the French ports on all American ir
' veflrli, as also on all those that might put n
1 into the harbour of Flushing, in Zealand, o
which latter has been resigned to the French tl
r government by our treaty with the fame." g
[We did not knnw before, that the cef- w
! fion of Flufliiagto France was to be added v
' to the long lift of degradations which the
â¢ Batavian Republic have experienced from S
their " dear friends and good allies," the h
1 French.] t
By an arrival yesterday. we received the n
" Madrid Royal Gazette," to 27th July, 0
f In the latest, the expedition of Buonaparte *
is spoken of as having the English possession
1 of India, as its prime objeft. The debark- y
ation of the French troops at AlexandrU t
1 gives iineafinefs to the Grand Sigino; but t
the advancement of the ftaff of the army to c
r the Pcrfian Gulph, from whence they are
" to proceed by water to the Malabar coast,
â¢ is considered as within the reach of the Ge
neral's entfrprize. Admiral Nelson was in
'Â» the wake of Buonaparte before he reached
> the African coast ; and will render a good
" account "Â»f the French Slipping, whatever
may become of the army.
COMMUNICATIONS- i
Notwithstanding the doubts which havi *â 
perplexed the minds of some the be ft men
â¢ in our country, rtffpefting the conduft of
Mr. Gerry while at Paris, we can allure our
e readers, from petty direst authority, that
e Mr. Gerry's conversation is such t > com* ]
fort the heart of every genuine federalift. j
It is said that he declares -in the most unei 1
quivocal terms, that every thing depends ori j
the union of the people in supporting the r
n energetic measures of President Adams. In '
short the whole tenor of his coÃTerfation is 1
ftatinchly federal, so that the Jacobins, whq '
had marked him for their own, are again ;
â¢ disappointed.âTheir prophesies concern- '
ing him, are like all the reft of their pro- 1
s pheties. If Mr. Gerry's popularity baS '
been impaired it is. a matter of no great J
wonder ; for so long as he was considered '
18 the favorite of the French and the chosen 1
one of the Direftory, how could it be '
otherwise ? It is probable that Mr. Gerry '
had a more favourable idea of the French '
and thier cause, than his colleagues, but he 1
has been long enough among them, tn fee '
r 1 them as they really are ; and now like a true 1
ie patriot and honest man, he utters his fenti- 1
ments without reserve , and with joy be it
spoken, they are the very fame which have 1
el pervaded every state in the union, as ex
-10 prefied in the numerous addrefTes to the
President, they breathe a devotednefs to -
the exclusive cause of his native country, a
r - zeal for .supporting with one voice, the
constituted authorities, and, a determined
resolution to resist the dedroying angel of
foreign influence.
Mr. Gerry, has. we learn, given the Pre
-5' fident of the United States, ample docu
â¢ ments of the whole course of proceedings,
In France: and we are told, when the A
mericas public are put in pofleffion of all
> e the fafts refpefting the nejociation, they
will display such a scene of arrogant de
mands, insidious overture, canting mean
ness, and hypotritical whining, as will con.
firm every American in everlasting hatred of
French measures and Frenchmen. Talley
x rand, now appears an angel of light, to
3 " what he then will.
a " The embargo on American Teffels in
France, is enforced with great severity ; and
Â£ OHr sailors are imprifsned. Retaliation
1C on Frenchmen iri the Unitsd States, ought
N " immediately to be adopted.

Expressions of the Public Will.
la a free republic, the public Will ought to
Â»â¢ be the general guide. To afcertam that will, al
ways has been a desirable objeft: ; âthat obieA has
3. been attained in the I"ni<ed<feites.âltisfeen to be
a devotion to the ani; r: in of our country ;
and is evidenced in the immense chain of Adireffes,
which has united the Northern with the Soutkern
d" States, and closely connefled the people bordering
on the atfentic, with those who form the frontier
line, on the most extended lar.d bo-rd. In every
place the fame fire has elicitedâthe fame hett an
t imatcd ; âand the procefshas exhibited limilar en.
â y thufiafm, all pointed at one end and aimâthe vin

â¢which was unanimously agreed to.
To she PRESIDENT of the UNITES STATES.
SIR,
WHILE we, (the inhabitants of the
;d county of Kanhawa) feel our ourselves high
a, ly iatereftedin thepeaceandprofperity of our
ed country; wethink it aduty incumbent on us
c * at the present crisis, to exprels to you a
p a f er, fe of our readiness to ilep forward with
our lives and fortunes, again It anv hostile
invaders, in support of the laws ai d inde
pendence gf the United States of Amer ca.
Although a irontler country, remote fp
from the feat of government, the happy con- tl
fequenccs, resulting from a judicious ad- lb
ministration, we liaveand do experience ; fe
wi(h it may continue ; and we wait but the o
opportunity to convince you, Sir, of our fli
unanimous determination to support and de
fend, (as far ss in *ur power) that Confti- w
tutioa wiiith hitherto has been produftive te
of so filutary effefts. The insults offered fu
to the Anserican flag by the French nationâ w
the depredations committed by them on our F
commerce, and a continuation of their ne*
farious praftices, we view with the highefc gi
indignation, and whenever it may be deemed F
necefTary by the Executive, we the people, v
of thi'3 county, pledge ourselves to you, Sir, tl
that we will grasp the avenging weapon, a
gainst those enemies of our country ;--nor g :
will we quit theÂ£â /-//. until death obliges, er E
viftory piviclaims it uunrceflary. tl
We have the fatisfaftion to inform you,
Sir, that from the unanimity of sentiment
here existing, the flag of the French nation,
the emblem of Democratic phrenzy, vrill
i never be ereded in this country, (or any tl
| other part of the United States) if our ut- ci
â¢ most efforts can prevent it.
1 Accept, Sir, our most fervent \vifh:s for
. your health, happiness, and continuance iu P
1 that exalted station, the fulfilment of thedd- e
ties of which, render you so dear to your

ANSWER
i Of the President of the United States to -
, ! the Grand Jurors of the county of UU 1
f Jler, in the State of Ntia-Ttrk.
t Gentlemev, 1
j I have received, with great pleasure, 1
J your address of the 14th of this month, and J
; I know not whether any that has been pub
j lifhed, contains more important matter or
1 jufter fentimenis. It must be great perverf T J
: ness and depravity in any, who can repre- )
l sent the late afts of government, and the c
, necefTary meafures'of felf-defence taken ky \
Congrefs, as a coalition with Great Britain. S
, It may be ufeful, however, to analyze oht
. ideas upon this fubjeft. If by a coalition Â«
with Great Britain be meant a return as co" [
9 lonies under the government of that country, 1
[ I declare I know of no individual in Ame-
j rica who would consent to it, nor do I be- 1
I lieve that Great Britain would again receive
. us in that ehorafter. Sure I am, it would '
jr be in her the blindest policy she ever con- t
i ceived ; for she has already the most incon- t
- teftible proof that she cannot govern us. If
e by a coalition be meant a perpetual alliance, 1
e offenfive and defenfive, can it be supposed
. that two-thirds of the Senate of the United >
t States, would advise or consent to it with- '
e out necessity ? Besides is any pne certain that 1
Britain would agree to it if we fhovld pro
e pofeit? I believe Americans ip general hare 1
o already seen enough of perpetual alliances :â  :
a Nevertheless, if France has made or flialll 1
e make herfclf our enrray, and has forced or 1 - '
d fhdll foice upon us a war in our de- '
,f fence, can we avoid being ufeful to Britain
while we are defending ourselves? Can Bri- 1
:- tain avoid being ufeful to defending '
i- herfelf or annoying her enemy ? Would it
1, not be a want of vvifdom in both to avoid
- any opportunity of aiding each other?
II Your civilities to me arc very obliging,
y and deserve my bed thanks.

r - The United Scates' brig General Pinch
o ne y> will be launched this morning, between
the kours of 6 and 7 osÂ®tck, from the
n wharf of Wrlliam Pritchavd.
d Yesterday arrived the schooner Three
n Friends, capt. Cook, in 52 days frotn Ma
tt i
We are indebted to Mr. Joshua Baker, 1
paflenger and a very intelligent gentleman,
for the following information.âEight days
before he left Malaga, a Greek Polacre ar
rived there from Malta, in 9 days
o The Polacre was at Malta prior to its sur
render to the French and was detained there
after they got pofTefion of it until they left
_ it, as was understood there, for Cagliari in
:s, Sicily.
rn The Greek capt. related that when Bu
onaparte's fleet appeared off Malta, three
of his ships were admitted into their harbor
n . 011 the requcft of the French Buccaneer, as
a. friends in a neutral port by permifiion of
n- the Grand Matter, and after they were in,
the remainder forced their way. A can
nonade commenced, which la fled seven hours
when tht Maltese colours were struck, and
' 3 the French substituted in their place by the
"j treachery of their own fo|diers.
As soon as the island was in their posses
â " fion liberty and equality cemmenced its usual
1' course of pillage and plunde', and without
't trouble transferred the wealth of honest la
bour to its vile invaders.
3 " About the 14th or 15th of July, the
French fleet failed from Malta for Sicily.
Buonaparte having garrisoned there 5000
of his troops, as the feenrity of hi-, con
quell and to enal(le the traitors of Malta,
to determi.ie the weight of the chains of
the devastator of Italy.
The Greek polacre left Malta with the
French fleet, a.d parted with them the
j" fame day, and the day after fell iu with
fp .ke Admiral Nelson's fleet, of 15 fail c.t |
the line, to whom he give information of
the bear nes and distance, which he fuppo- |
fed to be fifty leagues and he had no doubt j
of their falling in with them. The English
fleet went immediately in pnrfuir.
The reports at Malaga some days after,
were much varied, %Ut all the accounts sta
ted the meeting of the two fleets and the p
fuceefs of the Britishâseven fail of the line c c
were said to have been taken from the C J
French.
Five French pirates which were at Mala- 01
ga came out immediately before the Three ci
J Frieads, and a number of other American a l
, vffels, with intent of making prizes; but S
t the American vessels kept un-der the guns of ol
. the Tritoji, cSapt. Holtermsn, a L)ani(h fri
r gale, having under convoy about 30 fail of
r Danish vessels, and upon the approach of
the pirates, they received a falutethat nearly
( hulled one of them. Upon which they ran
t alosor fide of the frigste, j and promised j
t faithfully that they would mrlclt none but -j
1 the Americans, and received as answer from
j the Dane, that he would fink all those that
. came among the fleet.
In consequence of the embargo upon j,
v American vessels in France ; the French Q
u privateers out of Spain, had increased their j
i_ exertionsâThe fc.hr. Peggy, Tticker, be
ir longing to New-York, after having been
acquitted at Malaga by the French eonful,
was [tripped and had two additional prize
mailers placed on boardâand will without
doubt be condemned.
The French are so supreme and dreaded
in Spain, that no minister or governor dare
even oppose the bare didum of a French
confut in their oftn territory. The Fretrch L
thetnfalves declare, that peace would be the
death blow to their profpefts, and that war
to âwar with'all the world is their wish and
7- hope. _ I f
All that is nec-effary in the ports of ,
France and Spain for the condemnation of 'j
t} American property is to prove it is so.
d Extrafl of a letter Jrem Mr. O'Brien, the A
). merican eonful at Algiers, dated May 20.
)r "On the 13th in the morning# Haffan -
f. Bainaw bid us adieu, after a reign of fix
years and a half ; he was immediately fuc
,e ceeded by the prime minister Baba Muftapha, "
y who was proclaimed by tbe Divan on the
i. 9th
" On the fame day, we the Consuls, wait.
, n ed upon him, and were well received. The
)â¢ new Dey said the Americans were friends to
r> the Algerines, and might rely upon his
.. friendfhip, but he mult have prefenta to
make it lading.
" On the 17th the American treaty was
d renewed, and the treaty with Tripoli and
ii the United States, was renewed and guaran
a. teed by the Dey."
[f Arrived, schooner Friendship, Rea, Te
f) neriffe 31 day?.
â d Capt. Rea informs, that accounts were
â d received at Teseriffe, of the surrender of the
island of Malta, to Buonaparte. He men
at tions also, that there Were three or four
0 _ British frigates,-cruizing off Teneriffc, and
ye two,days before he failed from Maratava,
. . a boai from one of them, with a lieutenant
jl'[! 1 landed with some French prisoners. The lieu- .
or tenant informed that admiral Nelson had
t j captured 7 fail of the. line from the French.
; n The incredulous jacobins will not however
ri- &' ve credit 10 any account that muit so ma- 1
tcrially injure their let them tarry :
,- t a little and they will get it strait in their j
id teeth for some of Buonaparte's fleet are
certainly taken, and very probably himfelf
g ) with ibem.
Tbe letters which were received from gen.
Pinckneyby the mail of Tuesday, were da
ted at Lyons, May 31. They mention that
the health of Miss Pinqkney was nearly ref
j,. toredâthat gci). Pkickney would proceed
tn to Bourdeaux immediately, take passage for
either Boston or New-York, and pursue his
route home by land.
