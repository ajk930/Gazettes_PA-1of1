CONGRESS OP the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
ritten
Friday, December 30.
Debate on the report of the committte of ways
and means, on the un fettled balances due from
h the individual dates to the United States.
[Cominued.j
Mr. W. Smith said he could not agree to the
propofiiinn of the gentleman from Virginia, tho'
eventually the means recommended might be proper.
The fubjeft before them, he said, was a very deli
cate lubjeii, and ought to he treated with every
degree of candor. He was glad that the gentle
man from New-York had spoke upon the fubjeft
with a degree of moderation which did him credit.
The difculiion was an unpleasant one, and could
Â»> scarcely fail to excite a degree of irritation in the
house, which, however, it would be desirable to
' as mpch as poflible. For many years, Mr.
f S. fubjedt had {)een undi-r confideratioj,
and it was much to be desired, that it could now
mpt. rol, g hta close. He knew no better mode
of dbing this thin the one propnfed, vis. thSt the
debtor Hates fliould be informed of the Aims with
which they flood charged, and that payment should
1 be requested in such a way as fliould prove moll
agreeable to them.
Mr. S. said he should not follow the gentleman
from New-York (Mr. Willi.ms) through the
whole of his observations, because he did not think
them iflauve to the fubjea before them. Seme
of them roigUt have been properly enough fuauett
*'â¢ ed when the fuhjeft of balancing the accounts was
before the hoofe fce believed, indeed, they were
brought forward at that time. He would mention
mrs ome / atls rtla " ve to the business, with nhich per-
Miss , p * me g ent lemen might not be.aoquainted. In
the year 179Â®, it seemed to be the general with
that an adjuflment of debts and credits betwixt
edy th* general government and individual Hates with
ND refpeft.tothe late wai, n lo uld take place; that
balancer should -be struck, and those dates which
liar W f' e fero "Â£ ht debtors Ihould pay, and those
who were found to be creditors should receive what
Dre, *y as '"â¢ported to be just ; and, in order to facilitate 1
the the business, a great deal of compromise took 1
place, lo that it was at length agreed upon with a 1
the good deal of unanimity. In order to give the 1
the â¢ Â°PH ortuni, y of bringing forward all their 1
om c.aims, the commissioners were inverted with chan <
eery powers. After the business had gone through 1
leir the committee of the whole, the was only one 1
md question which occasioned any difaiflion, and upon '
to this the yeas and rays were taken ; this was the 1
ratio by which the states should be chawed. On a 4
I motion toftiike out this ratio, it was loft, to r
10 ; and what was remarkable, one half of ihe "
reprefents'ives from the state of 'New-York voted 1
for the existing mode, andthe other half for ft ik v
ing it out. [Mr. S. here read an extrefl f rom the a
journals.] It did not at that time strike the mem: "
bej;s from that date, that the ratio adopted would
injuie them. Whether subsequent events had made 8
it unfavorable to' them or not, was not now the c
question, but whether those states which had been {{
kj reported debtors should be called upon to pay what ''
was due from them. it
Mr. S. said this business might be compared to n
an arbitration betwixt individuals, where full pow- "
ers were given to the arbitrators; for after all that
could be said about the exertions of individual
states, was brought forward, it was agreed to put 8
the matter into the hands of three' commiiSonets ll
to make an award. The award was made and ac- c:
cepted by Congrefi. Whatever obieftioÃs were li
>n held against it, should have been made at that time cc
th e l /' e awar( * bad been carried into effed. Any K 1
in c Â° n, P' aint4 n,w brought forward against the princi- nf
p . es , ind â¢ ode of 'rt'lement, were certainly ill tfl
>e r y quefl'on now was, which is the Ta
n best way of completing the business ? He though' va
the mode proposed was the best. It appeared, by
lf the report of the committee, that the following M
h were the debtor states, viz. New-York, Pennfy*
:- vania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North- N
Carolina. The whole debt was 3,5 17,584 dollars, fr <
of which 2,740,000 was owinjr by- New-York
' The interest of the debt, viz. 844,218 dollars be- ,h '
, "ig added, made the whole 4,361,802 dollais.
I _ OIIr P re fÂ«t embarrafled fituatioÃ, said Mr. ce!
Smith, this money would be very acceptable. In 'X
, | order to meet the demands of the public creditors, th;
II Â» was well known that recourse mud It had to ad- brt
ditional revenue. It would, therefore, be very de- P ai
Arable if the debts could be collected, as it would Co
serve to lessen that sum which must otherwise be Sti
colleftcd from the people. Orthis money J he said, cre
might be ufefullly employed in providing for the Yo
â¢ defence of the country, cither by means of a navy, ,he
increase of arsenals, or otherwile. Indeed, there ma
were many beneficial objefls to which the money f,t)l
might be applied ; and he doubted not, when the onr
debtor da es knew the situation of the United tor!
States, those who were able to pay, at loft, would ,va(
come forward cheerfully, and pay the Aims due on
from them, in such a way as should be mod ag'ree. U "
able to themselves. gin;
Mr. Smith said, he should suppose, that even
the debtor states themselves would vrifh to have tbefe l,ou
accounts fettled, as it must be unpleasant to them
whi;n claims were made from them upon the United war
Mates, to be told they were in debt to the union. mt " n
He remembered an instance in the last frfDon, where afidl
this was the cafe with refpe& to New-York. Tile Mr
fettlemcnt ,now desired, would do away such difa- b , ut 1
greeabls insinuation, in future. As to the date of â, C â¢
New- York, he should be the last person who would
ay any thing that would be disagreeable to that prod

and entitled to every degree of refpe& ; but gen- P ro P
tlemen mull know that the finances of that state tr "?-
were in a mod flourifhing cohdirion ; that tLey had
abundance of wealth. [Mr. S. here enumerated an
account of their riches, J When, he said, they con- Â£

from Ihe only Mr. S. said, was whether
any material injury could arise from the application
proposed to be made to the debtor dates for pny

tho' to thepajmeHt Â»f the refpeftive balances, they
eper. would of coarse make them ; if not, they would
deli- dsubtlefs propose some mode of payment. But,

:oa!d Mr. Harper said it was very easy to fee hy the

Mr. 'hey war e about to make, upon New-York. He

with hie to ftn'ke, or to make a demand which he could
ould "at enforce. He had no doubt-that the settlement
molt wasjuft and, and that that state was realty in
debted in the sum ipecified ; but if they disputed
man the d</bt and the mode of settlement, they could
the n . ot force them to pay it. From these coafrdera

vac rid of the business without a deeffion. He (hould

vith Mr. Con hoped the committee would not rife,
vixt rtle gentleman from S. Carolina seemed to think '
n,h that a period might arrive when it would be pfoper 1
hat to negotiate on'the fubjeft, but not at present. If '

are m, Â£ flt have concurred with him in opinion â¢ but '

To THOMAS MIFFLIN,

SIR,
THE many important'fubje&s recommended by
you to the coufideration ot he legislature, will
command our mod serious attention.
In congratulating you on the prosperous situa
tion of our country, iu the enjoyment of peace,
and rapid ingreafe of population and rfeallh, the
feeling, which confiderationsfo grateful imprefc on
the mind, are dilturbed by the recollection, that
Ameiica is ere long to be deprived of the services
a pi'iiot, whose wife and ju'iciotts system oi
policy lias heretofore preserved us i.i tranquility and
liappinels. After a long and fplenid career in the
service of bis country, our beloved Pr.efideni will
fqun retire into the wa.k of private life ; and iu
expreffingour warm It willies, that his remaining
yearÂ® may be as happy as the preceding bate b.en
gloiious, we speak the unanimous of oui
grates*! country.
The circumUances attending the choice ot elec
tors of a President and Vice -President of the Uni
ted States, will naturally cab our attention to a
licral revision of the election laws, believing it to
be peculiarly necessary, that the legifLtive will on
the fu"bjett of elections, (hnuld be so . 1 :nr and ex
plicit, as to prevent the poffiiillity <us millaJte ot

It is a painful conliJeration, that the meaftireS
heretofore taken by the legiflattire to project tbe
lights of our citizeus 011 the .wrllcra frontiers, and
to give the necessary authoiit\ ta the laws in the
Wyoming dillrift, have not had the drfired effe&
âa controversy, which has so long diftu'bed the

THE BRIG DEAN.
It has been a foitunate circutnllance thÂ»t this
veflel was so season bjy difpatthrd sot the relief of
those vessels which have been, ana mull continue
diltrelfed on our coast by the present severity nf the
weather. The celerity with which this bulinefs was
effedted, oid mu,.h credit to the gentlemen who
had its direftioii. From Saturday evening, to the
following Monday, at iz o'clock, (when (he failed)
(he was completely manned and provided with the
several meansf.r the propÂ«fed relief. This a a of
tn.ma ity fi*(Â»m gentlemen underwriters deserves a
geuenl fuppori ; and a contribution to a fund for
nu extctifion of the proposed relief might he, with
ti â  propriety, made by individuals, enabled by
ihen affluent o r comfortable situations, to insure to
themli Ives the high gratification which would arise
from their probably faying woithy and tifeful
citizens from severe distress, or total deftru&ion.
1o this Inter observation we conlcfs to have been
ed by ;>ur knowledge of a generous offer of a ci
tizen to the gentlemen who had the principal charge
1 fitting out the brig Dean, that, though not an
underwi iter, or immediately concerned in trade, he
would willingly contribute a sum from one l.und lc d
and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars, for the
fibove benevolent purpose. We have only to add
our regret that we j are not permitted to mention

Letter of general Moreau to the Directory, dated
head quarters at Frtburg, OS. 15
Citizen Direflors,
The eoutage of the army has gloriously extrica
ted them out of the critical pofi-.ion in which it
Hood. By the Black Forest we were surrounded
by tire enemy who hindered our passage through
ihe narrow p;ffes, when at the fame time the arch
duke Charles advanced with a part of his army,
threatening to deftioy th? bridges over the Rhine!
It was neccffjry at this jundurc, to open onrfelves
a way, by vigorous efforts, which the victory of
B.beiacti war not fufficient to tffeft.
About 2J.0G0 tafn, commanded by generals
Petrafch and Nauendorf, had taken the pofls by
Roth well, Viliiagen, Donaufcengeo ai)d Neuftadt,
W aldfliut, and even the Foicft. towns, were occu
pied by Aurtrian troops and armed peasants. From
this you foe that all our communications were clit
off. T his was the more disagreeable to us, as we
could not receive letters from France, nor receive
any from thence. I commenced to force a paflagc
through lUc 1 Forelt towns. A half brigade, ef;
corringthe ammunition wagganl and the wounded
and fickj effected this without milch difficulty
That part of the army which was not ne. eflary to
check the progress of general Latour, who having
recovered from his defeat by Biberach, did riot
ceale to pursue ua, inarched to Rothweil and Dit
tingen, and aftei several vig irou? battles, drove the
enemy frorft thence. We took here paitof his ar
tillery, and made 300 prisoners.
It remained now to force the narrow palfes in
the Black Forelt. The center of the army rnaik
ed out the line to attack the corps of the enemy
rtationed ill Hell Valley. This is a terrible defile
for the passage of an army, as this valley extends
f-veral miles between two deep mountains, hardly
fro in 8 to 10 fathoms diliance. bravery o?
the troops fnrmounted all obstacles. With loss of
a cannon and 100 prisoners, the enemy was beaten,
and on the 12th Oft. the center of the army took
p,ofitioft before Friburg. The division of the arch
had already advanced to Ail Breyfa. h, from
whence they drove our troops, and took go pri
soners, which we retook, together with those that
cfcorted I hem.
The right and left wings of the army who had
juried, and continued to check the geneials Latour,
Petrafch, and NaueÂ»dorf, defiled on the 13'h, 14th
and 15th Oft. without the lead roll. All the equi
page and tianfports passed unmolested through the
fcorcft towns, coveted by the right wing of the ar
my. Thus, an army of which the enemy boasted he
would certainly make prisoners, now threatens him
with an attack, and returns to cover the frontiers, af
ter a marclji of looleagues without thÂ« leaf! loss ; dur
ing which they took from th*enemy 18 pieces of can
non > pair of colours and Hrarly 7000 prisoners,
amongst which thrre are 80 officers.
I fend you this ttiori (ketch to alleviate your anx
iety ; but I owe it ti> the biave army which I have
the honour to command, to give a more fpecific deÂ»
fcription of the many battles it fought ; to praifc
the patience and calm courage which they (hewed
under the grearelt difficulties ; the resignation with
which they bore the want of provisions in the hur
rid places which thoy palled. Every corps
ifed ltlclf, and the officeis did not cease to give
proofs of their talents and bravery. Several of them
in particular, Â«diJ gallant aftiprs, of which 1 thjnk
it my duty to give you more information.

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all perfonn agaiaft purchaling from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal estates fee couveyed away to
his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjeÂ£t by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well-os Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clsna
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust con fid in the fubfcribeis by
those creditors: a step which it would hava been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very statement of the fadt therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindidive." It originated in a defne to secure
the property-os the debtor as a sand for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
advice of council as a measure nectjfary to the fatety
of the creditors. If vhe advertifemcnt has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiiiable conduit, not to the sub
scribers who have merely published the truth
terras as mild as the fadf would admit, and who
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of th.)(e purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
naehan so confidently (peaks.
The fiibfcribers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eaution against purohaling of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it te a
purchase frora any other persons (if such there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan fnay have made similar
conveyances.
