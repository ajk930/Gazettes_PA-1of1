Si noil, qtiocuaque modo, vetr Horace.
Get money by tllmcans, gtt innney, tnv lad,
liy Â£ood means were bcucr âbut by fcood means
or bad.
WHEN we take a coitemplative view of
mankind, we find them pretty much the
fame in every age. From the moll distant
annals of antiquity down to the present day,
certain propensities have discovered them
selves to be predominant in the human
mind, and have influenced more <" less the
attions of men. Such is the desire for be
coming rich. Many men have adopted the
maxim welnve qmtcd from Hnrace. Their
hearts are so much set upon acquiring
wealth, that they often descend to base and
low live, nay, vicious means to obtain their
desired end. Altho' they are in eligible
tircnmflances themselves, and (land in need
of nothing ; yet, to gratify acurfed avarici
ous disposition, they will grind the faces of
the poor; cause the widow and the falher
lefs to weep ; and increase the affltftiohs of
the unfortunate. Fer a trifling debt, which
perhaps was contracted from necessity, they
will explore the habitations of poverty and
indigence. They will pti 1 away the bed
from under V sick mother, and ijrive off the
only remaining cow, on whose milk a family
of fixhelplefs children depend for sustenance.
It is true the laws of society authorize such
conduft. But the laws of nature, the laws
of humanity.benevoknee, and charity, speak
a very different language ;and we mull con
clude a man is diverted of every tender and
humane feeling, who willa& in such a man
ner.
Some men consider themselves as made
entirely for the purpofeof getting moaey ;
and think the end of their creation cannot
be obtained wilhofit it. They toil, and la
bor, fatigue themselves, ind wear out their
Hycs for the pleafufe of landling a few gui
neas, and contemplating farms.
Money is the hobby harfe of the present
day. It is considered as tie fummum bonum
of man's nature, It ccnftitutes dignity ; !
confers excellence ; and :onceals deformity.
It makes a man noble, learned and wife :
His conversation is particularly attended to;
and even his looks and gefturts will be cri
tically observed and considered as exhibiting
fupcrior excellence.
If a man of the mofc despicable chara&er
and person, acquires a large To' tune ; he is
immediately courted, and becomes a leading
member m society. The ladies will admire
him, call him handsome, and will be quite
in lo"e with the dear creature. On the o
ther hand ; only let an old maid, nine win
ters part the comer, by ttie death of an aunt,
or lotre other relation, cqme into the pof
feflion of a fortune : Though (he was be
fore neglefted, and passed by with con
tempt ; (he all at cnce becomes the bon ten.
Her youth is renewedâthe wrinkles are all
fled, and (he is surrounded by a tribe of fops,
as thick as butterflies around a mudpuddle.
Some Critics will perhaps condemn this
metaphor. Fops they mull acknowledge
may be well compared with butterflies ; but
they will ask, where is the fimilitutlc be-'
tween a woman and a mudpuddle ? I own 11
cannot tell ; but I think there is as much
likeness between a woman and a mudpuddle, i
as there is between a woman ond a cloud,!
which was the famous companion of Dean j
Swift. But the metaphor is not so bad if'
we consider it. A mudpuddle is sometimes
ruffled with the wind, and then becomes
more wrily ; and at lad it evaporates into
the air. They can discover half joes, and
guineas in her countenance i and many other
beauties, which would never have had an
existence, bad (he remained in her former
indigent circumstances. These things ought
not so to be ; and the world should be a
shamed, that it can discover no merit; but
what is annexed to money. Riches make
great folks ? But they alone cannot consti
tute happiness. Happintfs is not always
confined to affluence, and high-life ; but
(he sometimes deigm to be present at the
lonely dwelling of obfeurity, and retirement.
The rich are not more capable of social
happiness, and real enjoyment, than those
in moderate circumstances. The fun does
not (hine more geoial upon them ; neither
does the air breathe more fragraat, and re
frefhing. Pitiless disease, excruciating pain,
and agonizing death are not more lenient
towards them, than the more humble walks
of life.
Pallida mors, aequo pulfat pede, pauperum ta

Anxious and fearful lolicitude always
sets upon the brows of the rich man. This
is not all: Riches not only render him
wretched ; but they ere too apt to (hut up
the avenues of public fpirtt, and benevo
lence in the heart, andfcto contrail his liber
ality. The more he acquires, themoie ea
ger he is to accumulate, and keep what he

LONDON, October 2.
No official account had lalt night been
received refpefting the squadron which
failed from Brcft, but we can (late upon the
bed information, that it confided, as we
some days ago informed the public, of ~2
(hips of the line and 8 frigates, having 5000
troops on board. There is good informa
tion at the admiralty of this squadron having
made a conrfe to the southward after leav
ing Breil, and then making a large offing
to the weflward. and so coming round, pro
bably upon the North of Ireland ; but we
are fati-fied that the vigilance and number
of our squadrons off the Irifli coalt mujl
completely frustrate the plans of the enemy,
and jprobihly have few of their (hips to re
gain their own port .
Oftober 4.
Our paper of this day contains two notes
addressed by the French minillers to the
imperial deputation at ltsuladt : it will be
seen tint they are of a conciliatory nature.
Ths prefervatioft*t)f the fprtieffes of Kehl
and Caffel is no longer infilled on ; andtho'
the yield rio o'.licr
point of importance, they fetm (incerely de
iirous of bringing the negotiations to a con
clufian. We cannot, however, klfcover any
material alteration in the language of these
notes from those which have been formerly I
delivered : and we think the
contain have been errqneoufly ascribed to |
the influence of admiral Nelson's viilory, an '
event which was not kf.ownat Raftadt when
they were delivered in to the congreft: The
notes were written on the 14th, the very
day the account was firft published at Paris
in a supplement of the Rednftuer. Indeed !
agreeing to the demolition of the works of
Kehl and Caffel is not conceding so much
as fnay at firfl fight appear, fiuce the Fietich
seem determined to retain poffefHan of their
, refpeftive territories, atid refufe to with
draw the republican troops from the right i
fide of the Rhine, until the conclusion of a
a peace.
Theanfwer of the Deputation of the em
pire to the above notes will be anxiously ex
pected, for by the tenor of the next conclu
sion it is probable we (hall be able to judge
whether there is to be peace or war on the
Continent. The defeat of the French fleet,
however, is not likely to have that effedt up
on the deliberations of the Congrtfs which
some imagine, fincc, however fatal it may
prove to the naval power of the French re
public, it certainly does not materially alter
its r. latmng ?T-nf7rC-
A letter from Italy of sth of Sept. fays,
that on the 10th of Augult a fire broke out
on board an fcnglifh frigate in the harbor of
Medina, by which (he was partly consumed.
ihe French brig, the Lodi, which was ly
ing at anchor there, availed herfelfof the
circumstance, and set fail in pursuance of
her course.

' preparations for a second expedition from

The attack of our Fleet was the rnofl ma-
I fterly it is poflibl? to conceive. The French

and gun boats to protect their flanks. Thus
formidably polled, it seemed difficult to
force themâbut they knevr not the enter

undaunted courage of his officers and men.
Sir Horatio Nelson made the signal for his
fleet as they led in to get between the
French line and ths fhoreâlt was in per

bridge upon this unfortunate and trying e
vant. Happily the absence of his (hip was
of no material disadvantage to the result of
the adtion, though had (he had no (W of
it, commanded as (he is, we have little
doubt that everyone of the French (hips
would have been taken or burnt.
Of the duration of the aftion different
accounts have been received. It appears,*
however, according to the mod corrcd
ttatcment, tint it lalled nineteen h iurs.
By the manoeuvre of getting between the
french ships 2nd the shore. the Brti(h came
upon that &de on which the French were
tt e Â»ea.. prepared for aft ion, and this a ve
ry material advantage was in the firft jn
"ce gained. To repeat how our officers
a'd men behaved is. fuperfluousâthe most
ardent language of panegyric would fall far
tnort of their deserts.
We understand that Sir Horatio Nelson's

Strange as it may appear, we are well as-
Buonaparte's dispatches, the
name of l dia is never once mentioned. His
mo.d. it appears, was so engrossed by the
ciuiefs and desperation ofhis iitnation.lthat
he could think of that alone. And in a let
tcr from one of Bwmnparte's officers to his
wife, he fays that from the p. ofpeft which
they uen had, he would th n.k hinfe'f very

Buonaparte w:n without neceffarits.
His hofpicals were full, ancfcwithout medi
cines of any kind. Under these circum
flances '.he fate, of Buonaparte and his ar
my seems nearly decided. Cut off from all
reinforements and supplies, nothing could
be left for him but to fnrrender at discre
tion, or to make Cairo a Charnel house, by
the mortality of his whole army.
Captain Berry, wh.o gallantly r f oU ght the
Vanguard, after Sir Horatio Nelson was
wounded, may be hourly expefted to ar
rive with the admiral's more particular de
tail of the glorious aft on which heatchievec'.
To captain Berry the country owes every
tribute of the warmest gratitude for the
moll important services that perhaps ever
were rendered by any man hi a flmilar fitu
acion.
I he hon. captain Capel is the yonngeft
son of the earl of Essex : he has of course
been made pott captain.
A meflenger was dispatched from thÂ« ad.
miralty on Tuesday at twelve o'clock to hiÂ»
majesty at Weymouth, with an
the glorious viftorv obtained by admiral
Nelson. The messenger- h=.d reached Salif
buryin five hours and a half, a d ex*
to reach Weymouth by o'clock at night.
The ftips GuillameTell, and Generenjr,
mentioned in the lift to have efeaped, were
in such a terrible condition, that to save
their lives, their Crews thought pro er to
run them on fhure on the coalt of Alexan
dria, and abandon them, but the poor
wretches were put to the sword by the A.
rabs. Thus they have only f av Â«d two fr.
gates of their whole fleet ; and it is molt
probable that before t*<ey reach any port
they may fall into t ie hands of f ime of the'
English cruisers.
The transports were all anchored in the
Nile, and admiral KMfcfl' was preparing
â¢ fire thips to burn them. Â°
A I'icnch (loop ( ,f war. was also taken
,by the A cmene Brit,"ft Frigate, and they

on board, and I formed a plan to retake my

on the 4th inft. I got pofTeffion of a pistol ;
fame day I !>ave ihe watch-word, and pre
sented my pistol to the prize-master, who
with uplift d hands railed for mercy ; thr;e

twelve Frenchmen, some ran up the rigging, 1
thr fello-v at the h lrn ran below, one was ;
badiy wounded by my cook with an , xe,
and anotlier with a cutlass ; the aftion did
not last thin five miuutcs. My t\yo
men who w r below d d not come on deck
till we had fiÂ«i(hed, and were doling th;

The-French papers fpeeulats upon the
probability of the Etopire a fepa
raie peace, in cafe of hollilities being re
ifumc'i between Aultria and France. nd
such a peace, they fay, would be advanta

â¢view ; for U -wo ild contraift his line of de
fence ; hi 3 northern Frontiers wouTd be gua
ranteed by the'neutrality of Germany, his
forces would be concentrated, and be wauld
be the better able to combine his military
operations with Ruflh. But in isolating
himfel fom he Germanic body, would he
not lose his political confidsration in- the
Empire i And would not France pod'efs
the fame advantage as the Emperor of con
centrating her force ?

Buonaparte's dispatches were takeii, as wjS

was at iirlt conceived, in one of the prize:;

Admiral Nelson's letter* to Earl St. Vin
cent is as creditable to the piety of the writer
as theviclory is glorious to him as a feanian. 1
He begins his dispatches with attributing the 1
glory of the vi&ory to God. He does not,
like the impious general of the French, use '
the name ot the Moll for the purpose 1
of blaspheming him, or of denying - his power. 1

the attention (it the City Corporation, for
obtaining the threat ob'ieft of introducing'in

with lively currents of water ; and as. on
that basis is the reference to- the Â©ity Cor
poration, in the memorial agreed to be pre
sented to the Legislature, at the approach

the commencing of preliminary measures, by
the City Corporation, for introducing wa
ter, so alluded to, ardfe from well authen

| We trail (late the folloAving rtiterefting ar- ;
â  tide from the Speftateur du Nord of the |
2Mh November. It is a Postscript to a let- â 
; terfrom the Editor"to one of liis Subscribers. .
I " Behold, Monlieur, the news of the halt i
of the Ruffian troops contradicted. Nay, ,
further, we are -afTured tlut the firft division ;
of 3hat army arrived at T fchen the 20th of
this month. An event fhll \
is thepafPige of a Ruflian fleet of twel.-e fail ,
of the line and of fix frigates through the
Dardanelles, on the firft of September. This ,
event must prove all-important, if the fleet \
carries the troops d' ftined to fuccourthe kin.f j
of Naples, against whom it is fa'id the Dil ,
i"dory is already about to commence hoili- .
lities.
I lie failing of tlie Brest fleet 1 has been also |
announced,âhut rather vaguely. This fleet
would be able to excite new inquietudes for ,
, Ireland, if it had not to meet a Nelson in its j
1 way."
Tt is worthy Ã¼bte, that poor Logan, the |
more frequently lie appears before the public,
the more incoherent and nonsensical does his
conduct ftnke us. And herein he resembles a
certain inanimate body, of which Cervantes
fiys, " the more you flir it," &c.
YV e have lÂ«ng heard much of French mag- |
nanimity. Perhaps this quality can in no
other iituatio 1 be so eminently displayed, as
in adveiiity. God be praised, ill" has now
ample scope. 1

The rejection of Dearborn, author of the 1

for the most ample display of magnanimity, |
and patriotism, or the most unprincipled,
base, and atrocious obstinacy. He will j
prove himfelf a refledting, rational beiag, or
a stupid, malicious and insensible automaton.
Citizen Varnuin, the foi-doifant 'Republi
can General, from the State of MalTachufetts
stands in perhaps one of the most confpicu- {
oils attitudes that ever an individual was pla- ,
ced inâa situation grateful to the feelings
of a truly candid man, and a fit exaltation (
to infamy to the obstinate, unprincipled ca
baliil. Citizen Y arnum has his choice ; and
it rests with him to blot out his name from
the most damning records that ever met the
indignation of mankind, or to immortalize
it along with them. Never wr.s man more

It cannot be unknown to most of the read- _
ers of this Gazette, that Ireland, though j
more feriouily agitated within a lhort time Â®
past, has been kept in turmoil fi>r the hit '
twenty years, by a set of wild, ferocious air! 4

But tincc the bleflrd revolutionary age Â£rft
! dawned upon us, these gangs of invaders
, have hqrribly proxi-elled both in number and
atrocity of c'haraffi.
vVithout tj.-ftewirigr our attention (now
too lat") on that funereal policy, which be
held t'neie deftruftive intrulions so long, with
apathy, it is time for us feriouily to set about
the means of the definition which
these mighty forces are preparing for us. A
faÂ£t, which I will just mention en passant,
will shew that the confcquence I have uni
formly attributed to this evil, is neitb<tf nn
tnunded nor extravagant. There came to
Philadelphia within a few days, an Irilliman,
lately arrived in America, who had been five
times under the fallows, but had contrived
to ward off the stroke of juttic.â¢ by making 1
and promising to make further corrfcfHon? and
disclosures ; the importance of fomeofthele
relcaied his neck from the noole, on condi
tion of his taking hLihftlf out of the domin
ions of Britain. He is jiowhQita, a fiamin ,r
patriot, full of hberty and equality, and the
imprescriptible rights of man.
f am alarmed to eqrelifter the erne! faft,
that this Bloodhound was entertained at
the table of a I'ederalift. But it is nothing
new. nnlefs some abhorrence can be excited
again ft these wretches (for there ii none
now) we {hall fee this man, in a few years,
in tile Aff.-mbly, or in Cont*refs,ââa Go
vernor's Secretary, or a Chief Justice. Such
are to; rewards of patriotism in America.
B;it this is a solitary instanceâthe lad
three years h-ive abounded in fr.ch ; ard by
â such inen have been mftituted the foeietie?
of United Irishmen in Philadelphia. Such
is their origin -such their charadcr.
Of their views, something remains to fee
said ; which much occupation compels me
to refcrve for a future paper.
