The mail, which we expcflefl on the 18th in ft.

13 conceive how much this circumstance txcited the
euriofiiy both of the Otturoan tniniftry and the
whole Diplomatic corps, and made every one ex
tremely uneasy. After the letters were given out
we learnt, that the two Jt-mfTafiei, who according to

his Now, it is evident, from the above extract, that

)e- years, as long a period as in any state in the Union,'

Mr. Fenno,
It is a common mistake for the writers who at
tack public chara&ert in order to depreciate them
in the eyes of their countrymcn, to go too far in
their criticisms, and to render all their arguments in
effectual by the falfehood or injustice of a part. Of
this defeription seems to be Phoeion, who is cm
, ployed at present in delineating the chara&er and
qualifications of Jefferfon.
Whether Jefferfon is an ambitious man or other
wise, a man courting or shunning popularity, 1 am
not fufficiently acquainted with his disposition to
determine, knowing him only from his performan
ces of official duties ; and as the degree of his am
bition is not thoroughly ascertained, Phoeion might j
have continued to impeach him on this head, with- ,
out rnii(?h danger of oppofitijn or detection. But c
wlitn be undertakes to question his political abilities, j
9r fie comes upon a ground where every American is r
prepared to meet him ; and so much do the fen- f
timents of this counrry differ from him as to this Â«
particular, that I question whether any ftridlures
of his will be read with patience, that are founded u
i poa a position so unfortunately singular.
The mind of Jefferfon is universally allowed to
take rank amongst the firft of human beings. He
poffeffet an undcrftanding at once vigorous and ac
tive, uniting solidity of reasoning and deep pene
tration with a happy pliancy of attention that qua
lifies him for any station, either of executing or de
vising. As aftatefmaii I believe he has no fupe.
rior either in this country or Europe, and here is
the branch of his reputation that Phoeion it now
attempting to undermine.
It can indeed offend no man of candor to have the
virtues and vices of a candidate fairly displayed, es
pecially of him who aspires to so high a situation
as that of President ; but the writer who piretends I
to dirtrnft the mental faculties of Jefferfon, is surely I
x a most unfortunate assailant. He spends his force I
sgainft rocks and mountains. J
As to his philosophy, it is necessary to define the
term, before we pruceed to condemn him for this
pursuit. There are various species of philosophy, j
and each branch requires a diffeient genius. The J '
astrologer, perhaps, would make but a poor natu
lalift ; and he whofelife is employed in scrutinising
berbs and flowers, would as badly ftuceed in deve- I A'
loping the etheraal system ; and, perhaps, all these i
qualities united, would not form a good politician. I
When we speak of Jefferfon's philosophy, we evi- I â ,
der.tly mean to designate the peculiar excellence of I t
hie mind, without alluding to his proficiency in anv I \
particular science. He may, indeed, fonietimes a- I
mtife himfelf with Â«â¢, differing butterfles," for I 1
aught we know ; but it is not there that his force
lies. We admire him, chiefly, for the proofs that Dj
he has given us of his political[abilities j and frjm Â° u
our experience of his capacity in this way, we Â£ "
are now about to ftimmon them to new ftperations r'"
After all, Mr. Fenno, I do not profefs myfelf Â°
an advocate of Jefferfon : and if, as his opponents r '
alledge, his principles are white is called democratic
or antifederal, my heart reje<3s him altogether. It jÂ°
is iffential, that a man be elected into that office, "'
11 who, like the great Waihington, can consent to de
liberate, before he relolves upon harsher measures.
If Jefferfon is of this cast, I know not what objee
tion can be formed againlt him ; at least, there is
nothing about him to be attajked with It fs profped
â¢f success than his talents or experience.

1 Mr. Fenno,
The " Certificate of Mr. Jefferfm's good bp- '
haviour" published in your paper of yesterday, as
coming from the Assembly of Virginia, is, I pre
sume, intended to repel .the charge against Mr. Jef
ferfon of having abandoned his poll when Governor
of that ftatc on an mvafion of the enemy.
Admitting the certificate to begen nine, of which, c "mt
however, we have no proof, it is well known how k'd <
easily fwch ceitificates, or votes of thanks, are ob
tained ; generally at the close of the'/effion, when
the principal opponents of the measure are gone
home, and when others wishing to part in goo d hu- Ertn
mour, are easily persuaded to withdraw their oppo- I /
fiti n ; measures thus frequently pass nem. con. bc
caufe no member is willing to go into a difagreeablc C
debate, when if a debate and division took place, the W ,. hlcl
vote would probably be loft. I 1 " e 0
Besides, the certificate proves nothing as to the!" 1 ""
point in queftion,'for the charge was a want affirm- f""' Â°
ness; there was no crime in that ; the vote of p
thanks has very cautioufiy avoided this point-, it 11
only speaks of Mr. Jeffeifon's ability, integrity and
rectitude ; his ability antl integrity as Governor were
not called in question ; the chaige was timidity, and '
vet the vote fays nothing of Wnfrmnefs, fteadin-fs
and perseverance which was the only material point
He might have made a good Peace Governor of 1
Virginia, for u,Â« w tll known their Governors hare BAI
little or nothing to do : Mr. Jefferfon himfelf in On
b Â» Notes on Virginia, f. ys th â the governor<i s a of his
" ler e c VP her ' legislature dire* all hi, fident
operations. His friends m the legislature, cempaf. com
