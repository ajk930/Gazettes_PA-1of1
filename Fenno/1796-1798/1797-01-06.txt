THE SUBSCRIBER
Returns liiÂ« fintre thanks to his fellow-citizens,
for the exertions made by them on his Â®n
Friday evening lad during the fire.
Observing on tlÂ»t occafton a great number of
refpeftable persons all busily employed in taking
down and removing his furniture, he could not but
be iwipreffed wiih a very grateful sense of their be
nevolence. But it did not occur to him toioon
ceive, much less to expcÂ£l, that, not content with
having rendered him this service, they would after
wards form themfelvss, some into a guard to ftaiid
out of doors, in u cold night, with lighted candles,
to watch over and protest his property: others
into a voluntary patrole, to walk from time to
time, round the yard and his late dwelling,
andkeep at a distance persons whose honesty might
be doubted.
Among those who vtrere endeavouring to sup
press the flames, and fare the building, captain
SAMUEL PIERCE deserves, as the subscriber
is informed, lo be mentioned with particular >e
refpeft. This gentleman, it is said, brought with
him a party of failots, placed himfclf at their head,
and ascending upon the roo f , then surmounted
in many places by the flames, rendered eminent fct
vices at the rifkof his life.
The fubferibers think it also hiVduty to inform
the public, that, from concurring circumstances,
it it now well nfcertainedf that the fire took its rife
not from accident, but design. A few minutee
before the alarm was given, bis son William, going
out into the yard, heard some one jump down
(from the top, as he supposed, of the jack-cafe)
Hpcn the roof of the kitchen, leap from that into
the alley which runs between Mr. Davidfon's and
the free school, and make off into the llreet. Of
the truth of this account (which he gave immedi
ately to that part of the family whiqh was then iu
the kitchen) it ia a strong confirmation, that, zt
the fame time, the fubferiber and his wife, then
fitting in a room adjoining to the kitchen, heard an
unulual noise over head, as of some one falling,
and sent out two young persons belonging to the
family,"lo go up ftairi with a and discover if
pofiible, what had oecafioned it. Again, en the
cry of fire, two of his sons ran into the back yard,
where, as they afterwards aflerted, they perceived
a strong smell ef gunpowder. And that in this
they were not mistaken, has since appeared by the
teftimooy of colonel Nichols, who relates, that he
was one of the fit ft who ran up to the gariet flairs,
and that a strong smell of gunpowder was there
perceived, both VÂ»y himfelf, and those that were
Svith him.
From these and other circumstances, the infer
ence is, that the fire was communicated to the
building by some incendiary, who stood on the
jatk-eafe, and applied a match to the eaves.
But the ftrdngeft of all evidenees is that of the
ruins themselves. Let any one only place hirafelf
in the alley by the jack-cafe, andobletve the ap
pearance which the eaves, dire&ly above it, still
continue to exhibit ; and then let bim ascend to
the garret, and there take a view of ends of the
joists towards the quartet 1 above mentioned, burnt
deeply at the eaves, and less and less deeply as be
recedes from thÂ« eaves towards the middle of the
floor ; and he can have nÂ« doubt with refpeft to
the origin and progress of the fire, bat mult plain
ly fee that it was communicated from the eaves
which are ever the jack-cafe to the garret, and
in a contrary direction from the eaves to the garret.
CONGRESS OF tms UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, December 30.
Mr. W. Smith called the order of the day on
the report of the committee of ways and means en
the unfcttled balanees due from certain individual
states to the United States, which was accordingly
entered upon.
Mr. Williams rose and observed that he did not
imagine the resolution would have been calltd up so
food. It, had been put on their defies but a few days,
and he had been employed on committees every e
vening and morning sinceâhowever he would make
a few observations on the Subject.
The refolutian under consideration, said Mr.
Williams, was a call on the debtor Hates for the
payment of certain sums of money said to be due
to the United States. The Aate which he had
the honor tÂ« represent was one of this class. Did
he believe itsto be a debtor state, the last thing he
would ask for would* be a relinquifbment of that
debt ; but being fully persuaded that had a just and
equitable Settlement been made, or that the nature
of the cafe wonMhave admitted of ic, at the time
it was made, the state of New-York would ijave
been a creditor state ; and he trufied that he could
clearly demonflrate, from arguments drawn from
facts, that neither the mode adopted by which the
commiflioners were to determine on the claims pro
duced by the refpeftive states, or the rule of ap
pointment, which they were dire&ed to pursue,
could in any manner operate to do that justice which
the nature of the cafe required.
~ With refpeft to the mode adoped, it is enacted
in the third feflion of the aft, entitled " An aÂ£t
to provide mere effcfluaily for the Settlement of all
accounts between the United States and the indi
vidual states," 'â¢ That the commifiioners are to
determine on all such claims as 'hall have accrued
for the general or particular ence during the
war, and on thÂ« evidence thereof, according to
"the principles of general equity (although such
claims may not be fanftioned hy the relolves of
Congress or supported fey regular vouchers) shall
determine thereon." had the words within the
parenthesis been omitted, he alked would the Pe
nobfcot expedition' or the frigate built in South-
Carolina, or a number of such like charges ttiiau
[ thorized by Congress been admitted in the fettle
; ment ? But, by its being allowed, the states of
MafTachufetts and South-Carolina are made creditor
states. The creditor states have had their credits
tunded according to the aÂ£t, but not fa.isfied they
are now calling ujioa the debtor states to make pay

mentâa payment never could lia\e beer,
contemplated especially in the manner now called
for. .
Is the seventh feftion of the before recited act
the creditor states should have their balances fund
ed. This hath been done, bat nothing is mention
ed in that aft, or any other, to authorize the call
on the debror dates in the manner propafed. Itis
piwbable, said Williams, if it had been con
templated at that time the aft would not have puf
fed.
With tefpeft to the rule $f apportionment which
the cotrtmiffioners were directed by law to pursue,
Mr. Williams contended that it was impoflible, that
any thing-like public could be done, parti
cularly in the date of New-York ; besides, laid
he, it tvas a departuie from the rule laid down and
ettablilbcd when the articles of confederation were
agreed to, ths eighth article of which is, " That
all charges of war, and all other expences that
(hall be incurred for the common defence and gene
ral welfare, and allawed by the United Saates ia
Congress afTembled, should be defrayed out of the
common treasury, which fhoald be supported by
the' several dates, in proportion to the value of
1 nd 9 within each (late, granted to or surveyed for
any person, as fucli land and the buildings and im
provements thereon should be edimatcd, according
to such mode as the United Sta'es in Congress as
sembled (hall from time to time direst an'd appoint.
The, taxes for paying that proportion (hould be
laid and levied by the authority and direflion of the
legislature of the several dates, within the time a
greed upon by the United States in Congref* at
lerabled.'' And, therefore, said Mr. W. the aft
pointing out a different mode was a retrofpeftive aft,
operating ta the disadvantage of some of the dates
to theadvantageof others ; had this 9ft been pas
sed immedrately at the close of the war, inltead sf
being omitted until fix years after the war, it would
have operated equally; but no rule of apportion
ment could then be adopted, without a mamfjft
injury to some states, tqyvhem thoulaiids had emi
grated others. This was the cafe in thed.ite
of New-York. One third of the number of inha
bitants in that (late when the enumeration wasmade,
had moved into it after the close of the war, from
the New-Euglaud dates and the date of New-Jer
sey ; so that the numbers in those dates were dimi
ni(hed,,while that of New Yotk was
The mode of apportionment mud, in consequence,
operate unequally. Even lince the settlement hid
taken plaot, some thousands of families had come
into the date of New-York, from creditor dates ;
and how could a discrimination be made ? Or would
it be jud to compel those who bad emigrated from
creditor dates into debtor dates, to pay the pro
portion of the money said to be due from debtor
dates, whereas, by the settlement, had they re
mained ip the creditor dates, they would have been
entitled to a proportion of the money due to them.
Or, said he, is this resolution calculated tq prevent
emigration from one date to another.
Mr. Williams sbferved that attempts had been
made to have the priviledgeef examining the prin
ciples oT the settlement by the ccimniflioners, and
the charges exhibited and allowed from the refper
tive Hates, but it had keen ref"nfed. 11, said he,
the creditor states were conscious of the settlement
being proper, why this refufal ? But, until this was
done, could it be expeAed that the debtor states
would submit to a settlement which they had every
reason to believe was founded on erroneous charges
exhibited to the commiflioners ?
With*efpeft te New-Yoik, their advances had
been such that the firft calculators i.i the Union,
who had been engaged in public btifinefs during the
war. said that the state of New-York must, on an
equitable settlement, be a creditor state to the a
muunt of two,millions of dollars. Mr. W. said he
had been from the commencement of the revoluti
on to the cloie of (the war, either in the legislative
or military capacity, excepting about one year, and
he was confident that no more could be done than
was done by the state of N,ew-York, and a state
having done all they could do, it was not possible
it could be a debtor state. And, said he, (hall jhat
state now because it had exhibited fair and
honorable accounts, such as the commissioners ob
served, were like merchants accounts, and would
Hand the scruples of law, omitting many accounts
which oould not be exhibited in proper form, as
the nature of the cafe would not admit Â«f it unless
by mere calculation ? Ac'ding to this, the difficul
ties that state had to encounter, which ought also
to be takeÃ in view en a final settlement.
As the commencement of -he war, said Mr. W.
unfortunately for the state ef Ncw-Yorjc, the one
half of its inhabitants were difaffe<Â£trd to the then
measures, and a number actually took aims against
those who were friendly to the revolution, the sup
pression of whom, with a cenftant watch over them
were never brought into the general Sccount. In
the beginning of the 1776, the enemy took
New-York,, and with it nearly one half of the va
luable part of that slate. In ihe year following,
Burgoyne's army penetrated its frontiers, and laid
wade the greater part of the country north and
weft of Albany. By the memorable battle of O
nlke, upwards of three hundreJ widows and chil
dren were left to be supported by that state, as well
as some hundreds at the north part.of the (late.
These, together with the poor from the city of
New-York, were supported during the war, and
no charge made thereof. The endeavours of the
enemy to form a junction of their armies near the
Hudson river, was the cause of that date being so
overrun that not one country escaped their ravages.
Add to.this one third of New* York, the fihe town
of Efopus, and ieveral hundred of honfes in the
frontiers were burnt and immenle property destroy
ed. For calamities fe great very few thought of
obtaining voucherj, and for the deftrnftion of ar
mies no allowance would be made, which occasion
ed numbers to be reduced from affluence to want.
Large films of money said Mr. W. had been paid
by the slate of New-York, since the time limited
to be exhibited for a settlement with the United
States. Thejuft debti exhibited by the claimants
and the reafonaftlenei's of the exi-ufe for their not
having presented tl.em sooner, operated wiiji them
so forcibly that they could not be withstood. Ma
ny accounta exhibited asd no: paid will amount to
uÂ«nvrr;!s at out mil'icii of <3>-*V.rÂ«, and "TOttilW* 31

But, |it will be laid, had *ot othei ftatej fuffer.

he, had they their capitals kept from them dutirig
the war ? Where had they their frontiers overrun
and destroyed ? Wuete had they their country laid
waste and destroyed ? Was is not r a fait, faiii he,
that during the war the inhabitants of. New-York
had to procure their lalt from the New-England
Hates, New-Jersey, and Pennfylrania,
them on an average, t.wo bufheb of wheat for one
of fait, and every other article in proportion. Add
to this, they had from time to time taken frotn

fufficient to support ttieir families by acts of im

he was perluaued that no moie would be laid re'sÂ»

inch an odious liigma would be done away.

1781, that if it were not for the exertions ot ihe
Uatc of New-York, and the fupplics by ihe'm at
that time furaiflied, he mult difbanj tne arniy.

â  observe- with what emulation these little crcatttres, as

particularly the leÂ»ft Poney Boxer (who generally

ness that are altogether uncommon âIn (hort, to the 1
lovers of horfemanlhip this mull be a very agreeable

Thitaufttf Republicanism.
Democrats, if now you hear half as much as
you hl*e said on this fubje<3, you will be very wea
ry, and very angry. But be patient, you have
* had your day.
You swear to a man that France renounces forer
rer the unjust and abominable doÃrine of meddling
with other governments. 1 his is not true, for j
Gfegoirc in hisreport fays the rights and duties of
rations (which he had made an enumeration of) re- j
late only to those nations which have made liberty
and equality the basis of their governments. The j
French of couife are the judges. f
' But if it were so, which it is not. how could the
taufe of Rcpablicanifm depend on the French I A
poor dependence if the wild, inconsistent and wick
ed a<3s of the French fattier,s could affect that
- good cause. They may iofult, they may disgrace
it. It is not tin it affair to save it, or to exemplify
it by their doings. No good Republican will pre
tend it.
This is one of the thouland and one Democratic
lies and inconsistencies.
But admit the fa<3, that the cause of republica
nism depends on the French. Then they serve it
badly. Are the people of Sardinia made republi
fcans, the Pftiffians, the Germans ? No, no, no,
tier the Spaniards. The French by treaty give a
fanÃion to monarchy. Probably they agreed wi-h
i Fruffia that if he would quit the CoalitiÂ»n he should
keep his share of plundered Poland.
, The world will be left just as monarchial as e
ver. Let them not boast of Holland. It is a
French province. But the Stadthol'-.er was a mere
Shadow of the Executive power before he fled.
Let us be undeceived, though it will be a year ,
or two later than the reft of'the world. Their
victories may conduct their armies to galleries of
piilures and to rich cities. There they may load
mavy waggons with plunder. But as to princi
ples, Tippoo,Saib advances them as much, and
difgr,aces there less.
Let -fafls it lift open the eyes of those second

are every where app r ehended. The ecclrfiaftical
property is about to be seized by the French com
missioners ; but the people, strongly bjgotted to
their miniftein, and their religion, seem, in several
parts, disposed to refilt the confifcation by open
torce, in which they are encouiaged Jby the emi
grants and refia&ory nonjuing pnells. The ma

f Shall we have peace, or fltall we continue the
" war? this is the general anxiery at presentâDoes

" enquiries of othersâ-for my part, 1 reduce a l! the
' above queftiona or enquiries to this single one ;
" Can the French government continue Ihe -war f If
Â» this queilion be answered in the affirmative, they
u *ri!l wilh. for peace, England also as well as Â»he
emperor. If they are unable to continue the war,
they will wish to continue it, England also as well
3s the emperor. C#e half at least, of what 1 just I
advanced, is I think very intelligent to every body
a What may not be fd, is, that it being in the pow

d S I RASBOURG, 17 Vendemaire. |
i- The Auffrijns flill continue their incursions on the
it! 1, ft bank of the Rhine. The large body of the ene
my who have marched towards Germefeeim have for
-1(] ted the country people in the environs of Hirxhem and
of all the neighbouring townships Jo deflroy ibe en-
' trenchrcents which the French had eftablifhei there be
fore. A detachment of ijo horse went afterwards to
to Lauterbourgh with a design to take pofTefTion of two
coufiderable magazines of grain and hay. They had
llready.begaa tÂ« force the inkabitanti te fjpply them
with horses and waggons to tarry off their booty,
when the troops who had marched from here to meet
tliem arrived at LautirbÂ«urgh, and drove them frbm bo
ihence. The hay remained whole, but the enemy car- in;
ried oft three hundred quintals ps corn. They did not
lay the town under contribution but contented thctn- in]
salves with exaftng a certain quantity of brandy for bu
each of them. This party was commanded by a man fui
who spoke the French language very well, an' who
is said to be an emigrant from Mentz. La!l night, wi
another strong detachment from the enemy appeared ag
in. the neighbourhood of Wanzeneau, but they took
to flight the moment they discovered the republicans ro;
marching towards them.
The municipal adrmtiiftrators of Lauterburgl) till
and WifTemburgh, took to flight at the approach u>
of the enemy, and are fafely arrived in this town,
but the carriage which was transporting the papers
of tlie juflioe of the peace |f Wiflembutgh, tho'
escorted by the gendarmerie, was plundered of af
fignats ovd mand'ats, by the peaf<)nu, between
WilTemburgh and Ssltz.
P S. We at this moment have received the molt
pleasing i-itelligence 'from the army of Moreau.
O:/ the loth and I Ith, the enemy have been mod
completely beaten. It was on. Gen. Latour the
principal advantage was obtained. The firft tnef

A letter of General Moreau, dated Odt.s.
After describing long marches, fays:
' "Thus, an army of which the enemy boasted he
would certainly make pfifoners, now threaten* him
e with an attack, ai:d returns to cover the frontiers, as

II An artii le dated Leipfic, OA. aa, faysâ" Rum
ours of a peace between the Emperor and the French

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all pe/foHS 'aqainft pun-hating from the
grantees Â»f Blair M'Gieuachan, any portion of the
large, rÂ«al and personal estates he conveyed away to
hit fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Cleaachan and P. Moore as ef Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was 110 mere than an execu
tion of that trust confcdÂ«d in the? fubferibers by
those creditors: a step which it would have been a
btaech of duty and honor in them to have emitter!.
The very ftatcment of the fat* therefore mall djf
pcl the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindictive." It originated in a dcfirc to feeure
the property of the debtor as a fund far the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fanAioned by the
advice otcoancil as a measure neeejary to the fafety
of the creditors. Jf the advertisement has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjafliliable conduct, not to the fnb
fctibers who lujre merely published the truth in
terms as mild i?s the faSt would admit, and who
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of thole pnr'chafes of which Mr. M'Clc
â achan so confidently speaks.
The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of dnty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eaution against puroJ>afing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
pnrehafe from any other perfous (if such there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clcnachan may have made similar
cenveyannes.

PROSPECT-HILL,
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Bra.idywine

dwelling house is built of (tone, two dories' high,
genteelv fini.'hed, and contain,four handfime rooms 00
a an entry, with capital garrets, znd convenient
cellara, It .is gen cully thought to command the mofta
grceable profpeS of the Delaware, from,the fomce of that
liver to the Capes. This profpeft ia greatly rmbclli.W by
a full view of a va(t body of meadow, through which the
Chnlliana and Brandywine creeks are feeri winding in beau
tiful meanders. Near ihe house are a Kiletten, a fpaeinua
hone liable and hay loft, a barn, a carriage house, rpiik
ftoufe, &c. and a well of as puifc water as any on the conti
nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
the very bed kind, brought from Maryland, and in full Hear,
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, jpole
orchard begining to bear, and lcverai old ireesthat produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm confills of near Gxty acres of land,
ot good quality, aud clear of incumbrances, except taxed,
twenty of which ire now in excellent clover and timothy,
and ten more will be ready tor lowing next fpriiig. A iÂ«-
fider.ee of nearly 8 years has convinced the fubferiber that
the ftuation is remarkably healthy. The groat poll lond
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within Seventy
yards of ihe house. In a word, the beamirs and conveni
ence of this situation cannot be enumerated in an advcrtile

tention of any pei son who is desirous of living at one of the
most elegant country feats on the continent. The pur-ehafer
