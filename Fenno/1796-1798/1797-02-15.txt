Some convulsive dying Ornggles were to be ex
pefted fromthe jacobins ageinft the " last not lead"
measure of' Waihington. The correS apd able vin-
the government, agaiult French claims
and charges, has produced a neccffity of fubtaifuge
amongthofe who hate plain fads. Now it is affer
, ted that the old court were Bot fincrre in their offi
cial publicationsâand that though we
ledge their dijtrterejledneft, we oujjht and rauft firlf
; adtait that they were not to be truficd âthe citizen
can perhaps tell us -when they arefmcere ? Are they
[ fmcere when t-Jiey talk of fraternityâor does
, matrimonial language of " drawing the bonds of
. the two republics closer" mean a diplomatic jtietti
nefs of fxpreflion ? Is a minister sincere whÂ«n, as
Genet did, he tells us that France does not wish us
to go to warâthat (he loves us too well to wish any ,
thing more than our peace and prosperityâor does
he mean the reverse ? Was the ci-devant
cere cither in his threats, too certainly have 1
been amply realized upon oar defenfelefs trade in '
that very scene to which they invited itâor in his !
carejfes of the peopleâor in his marvellously modest ,
demand of gratitude, the difinterelted boast of hi
ving given to us our in his manly
discontent at the A.lmanac precedence ? Some years
hence, a future citizen may aflert that this lan
guage was, at the time it was nfed, intended not to
rouse the people into civil, war, nor to lead us into '
a war with England, but that it waÂ» intended to im
pose upon the whole world.
Mr. Secretary Pickering is accused by the jaco- '
bin Writers wttfi having taken two months, to com- '
plete a production, which was destined to widen thc 1
basis of American Independence. The French par- '
ty will excuse ub in this country, if the natural 1
phlegm of an American mind retard the progress
of decisionâwhen documents of higl rreaning and 1
authority ate to be resorted to and compared ,5 where t
faSs, those provoking ftambiing blocks to the vifi- '
onary, are to be difplay'd, and indudlions to be 1
drawn from thÂ«m, these intuitive gentlemen will |
forgive a minilter of our republic if he use dili- 1
gence in research, and slowness of judgment, upon v
points, which when once fixed, are twt to be reeed- ,
ed fromâwe are neither Pope-raakers, nor French- '
m <nâwe deny both infallibity and iafpiration,and
never do a great aÂ£t by acclamation. Had the fe- 1
cretary fcllowed M. Adet's method, materials and F
Jiile, it is to be presumed the piece would have been I
never written, but printed ojf, as fact as invention '
furnifhed the paflages ; and with as much prompt
ness as a certain novel writer is said to have exerted. 1
This notable author was alfa a Printer, and it is c
said, by Gibbon, used to print as fact as he compo- 1
Jedj without hafing any copy before him ; rapid all
from his own head â this might do for a work of *
jillionâOn the whole, truth is so valuable, that it '
will be found more'lafting, thoughJlowly developed
and acknowledged, than those falfefhoods which v
haste engenders, and lefle&ion destroys. 1
COMMUNICATION. ]
In arbitrary governments, where the gift of almost i
every office, whether considerable or unimportant, is v
in the erown, disappointments, which rpuft necelTarily â¢
be frequent, die away in whispers or expire in, silence. '
Fear is the principle that produces order and lubmrf- V
fion. Were permission given by such governments to c
Â«vtry man inclined to appeal to the public, and dif- Â»
posed to emit hit spleen, there would soon be a com
plete revolution. A despotic government must necef
tarilv engender abuses more enormous ani numerous
than one where the conduct of public officers may be
fcrutiniaed freely. Hence their policy of reftrainine
the liberty of the press. This valuable centinel of
freedom is doubtless one of the firmed barriers against
tyranny; and if permitted for a ffiort time in countries
\yherr prevails, would speedily operate a .
changefavorabU to the general mtertfls ; bnt like moll
â privileges it lsfubjefl r-Â» abiife. a
In a limited monarchy, iUse England, the rage .of
a disappointed candidate, or an' ambitious or needy so- I
licitor for office is vented through T!,,- Dar t
ty gazettes! and often becomes l'Â» ,rkfome to the mi- ,
n y, that something tangible is held out, and the
patriot bccomes filcnt. c
In the United States this is not the cafe. A Prefi- 0
dent, though participating with the Senate in the a
power of appointing to offices, cSnnot gratify everv 3
claimant who thinks himftlf entitled to notice Dif si
appointment impel, him to the fide of opp'ofijion. p
There, without enquiring into the motives of prefer- I
ence, he abuses and misrepresents without jullice 8 r ,1
mC f rCy '.i, T "/ the con sequences influence him n
-for the press is free, as ,t ftiould be in every free "
country. No pecuniary donations can be offered- P
No offices are vacant: he therefore goes on Â«.Â«Â»â

A President of the United States must expert to en- r
counter all this. It is a concomitant lrfe-wb'e fmm

this bu.lding also was let on fire by ilefign.
Â«' On Monday morning last, about 7 o clock, a Irnokc
wk per eived to iflue from the barn a few rods welt of
the meeting-houfc in this city, belonging to Mr. Aza
riah Lafhrop. Search was immediately made, and it j
was found to originate from some fire upon the top of
a hay mow, which, if it had not been immediately ex
tinomlhed, would in a few minutes more, have been
beyond the power of all those prffent to save it. Two
chips were found on or near the hay, which convinced
the aftonilhed citizens, that a coal of fire was brought
, in them with ail intention to destroy that as well as oth
er buildings.
It appears almost an impossibility that four luch dar
s ing attempts, within so short a space of time, fliould
t be made to fire this city, three of which were made
early in the evening, and one after the rising of the
fun in the morning, and yet the perpetrators (hould Â«f
---cape undiscovered, and not even any person (hould be
fufpefled, with a degree of certainty, so as to have
thein arretted ; all appear* to be a mystery ; no person
' can conjecture what their design is, but nnmbrrs of ob
' jecftions will immediately rife to oppose it. Alarm and
1 fear occupy the attention of all clafTcs of the inhabit
: ants, expelling every moment to fee the city enwrap
ped in flames We are happy in mentioning that up
wards of twenty of our citizens voluntarily tarn out
and patrol the city every nrght. We hope soon to be
able to inform, that the hardened wretch.who has dar
ed to commit so great a crime, is fafely lodged in tke
hand's of justice.
Another alarm. âWednesday, February 3th, 3 o'
clock, P. M. The cry of Fire has at this mon.ent a
larrried the inhabitants of this city. Our paper is
printing, and we can only mention that a barn belong

fire it is said was kindled by some daring villain.

The great importance of thediftilleries in the ar- (

The meflenger sent to London by Lord Mafm
e(bury U returnedpaWlÃenegociations are refam
ed. 1 bey have at last made a step forward j for
after childishly refufing to explain himfelf on the
principle of compensation, set forth by Lord Malm
efbuiy, oar learned Minister afiumes in the molt
positive mannei, enlightened, no doubt, by a fort*
night study, and also a little by the leftbns of the
writer, who proved to him that there was no im
propriety in acknowledging this principle, Â«nd that
it was indeed pledging ourselves to very little ; be
cause we reset ved still the full power of (hewing our v
selves as difficult as we pleased tefpe&ing the na
ture and the extent of the exchanges and propor
tionate compensations. At least the firll difficulty
.of formality has been done away, which is certainly
something, as the official' diplomatic notes will
shew. â  -
If our Plenipotentiary, instead of his last infignifi
cant answer, had returned that which he uow gives,
and formerly admitted, as he now does, the principle
of compensation, he would have accelerated theiflue
of the negociation by a fortnight, and would have
not appeared to be a man who quibbles and recedes,
and pretends to have already said what in fact he
had not said. We might go 011 and a/Jc of Him >
little less diynefs and asperity of language ; but hi*
diplomatic education eannot be perfedl all at once.
By Lard Mamefcury's answer, which we do not
suppose he will fend to hit Cabinet by a Courier, ai
ths question addressed by the DireAory must have
been forefeen, we shall fee, whether he will also
make use of mare franknefs in his overtures ; whe
ther he will relinquish his perplexing and dilating
course, with men who despise and cannot patiently
bear the delay of formalities.
That of the two governments which, without
losing itfelf in the labyrinth of formalilies, shall an.
! nounce with prpeifion and moderation, the principal
conditions upon which it wishes to ntgociate, will
prove the sincerity afits pacific intentions, concili
ate the general opinion, and make it a terrible weap
on against its enemy. It wovld be worthy of the

alty and good faith. ' Â«

it my duty to write to the Governor and Deputy
Governor of the bank, and of the memorandum,
therein referred to, which it is their intention to lay
before a couit of proprietors this day. I have the

from many great mercantile bodies and refpeftable
houses in the metropolis.
" The repeated proofs which the citjzens of Lon
don have given of their zeal and public spirit, leave
me no doubt, that if it appears likely to promore
the interests of the country at this important crisis,
it will receive theircheatful support in their indivi

" It is unnecessary for me to state the effeÂ£l
which such an example would produce throughout

you may think moll advifeable for bringing the

of a tame goat belonging to the Fencibles, which
wa6 wantonly killed by one of the militia-men.â
To appease the manea of their long-bearded play
fellow, which had followed the regiment out ot
Scotland, and was an universal favourite, the Fen
cibles assembled under arms, and sent a defiance to
their opponents, which was accepted : the parties
wetc drawn up in battle array in the barrack-ground
and the molt bloody confluences were every mo

i formed by a person who held another office, and
i that he was not prepared to fay what was the a
, mount of the salaries.
i General Tsrleton combated some ,of the state
, ment* in the eftinaates, after which he went into
i some general topics refpe&ing the new arrange
ments about to be made in the island of St. Domin
, go. He undeiftopd, he ftid, that a corps of IO
tr 12 thousand men was to be sent to Portugal,
and if wc had such a number to spare, it was a great
hardlhip to harrafs every gentleman who kept a
horse with such inconveniences as were felt from the
cavalry tax. He apprehended that it would be
very difficult for any officer with fach troops as
could row be spared him, to gain any reputation
in the defence of Portugal, and was afraid that they
would fare just as well as Holland and our allies in ;
the Mediteranean.
Mr. Serjeant moved the sum of one million nine
â¢ thousand pounds for the service of the Ordnance.
Mr. Fox asked whether in that sum was inclu
ded the expence of arms for the additional cavalry.
, A rumour, he said, had gone abroad hitherto un
contradicted, that, either from an alte'ation in the
fituatiori of the country or the impratfticability of
carrying it into execution, that a& aft was soon to
! be repealed, 01, atlcart would not be acted upon.
Mr. Pitt replied, that aims for the additional
cavalry were included in the present estimate. As
to the rum >ur mentioned by the Right Hon. Gen
â  tleman, it was the firft time it had come to his
â  ears He had indeed heard, that some difficulties
, had arisen in the detail of the provisions, which may
render an explanatory aft proper in the course of
â  the session jâbut he apprehended, there was no
thing that could obftruft the exeeution of a mea
sure, which he considered as necelf.iry at this mo.
ment, for the welfare and security of the country,
as he did when he firft moved for it.
Mr. M. i\. Taylor cxpieflcd bis joy at finding
that there would be another opportunity of d'fcuf
. sing thisaft, the provisions of whiVh he pronoun
ced to be absolutely impracticable. The gentle
, men whoattended the meetings upon it,, interpret
ed it variously ; and he would defy the minister
1 himfelf, or any man that fat near, him, or any man
in the kingdom to canftrue it.
Mr. Pitt ironically admitted, tliat if that lion,
gentleman profefled himfelf unequal to the con
ftruftion of the aft, it would be highly prefump
tuou's to him, or ony other prrfow, to arrogate the
capacity to-do so. Still, however, he hoped that
he might be excused if even after this difcouragc
. ment he (bould venture to attempt it.
Gen. Tarleton ol jeftcd lo the sum of 12,0001*
1 for fortifications at Dover and the .places adjacent.
There was no part of the kingdom (o well defended
by nature from an invasion of the en.my, as the
coast of Kent ; but if it were otherwise, every mi
litary man mulTTee that Dovet Caltle was little
i calculated 'o relist the attack of an enemy, and if
I they landed elsewhere, it could make little defence
when they should aflail it in reverse.
Mr. Serjeant explained, that th strengthening
of Dover became more nccelTary now, when the
French, by the poffiffion ef Holland, had so ex
tended a line of coast. The enemy mult firft be
come mailers of the castle before they csnld enter
the harbour, and additional fortificarfons, which
. in fact ceft no more than 1 20001. were recommended
by the noble lord at the head of the Ordnance de
partment, with all the military alMance he reqiii
-1 red, and the general who commanded in that dif
trift, recommended ft ill farther fortifications.
, Gen. Tarleton thought even 12,0001. too m*ch
1 for the proteftionof a few fidiing boats.
1 Capt. Berkely reminded hftn that Dover was a
- great depot for naval and military (tores.

tions that the force at Curracoa consists of two
Dutch frigates, who have the Orange colours fly
ing ; the Peufee, and another French frigate, all
which are in a miserable (late.
The arrival of the ship President, Captain Lo

accounts several days later than we have received,
does not furnifh us with any thing of material con

at the admiralty office, Rating that his majesty's

Sheerncfs to Yarmouth, had Ittuck on a sand bank
in the Main, and was tetallj loft ; we have however
the pleafore to add, that captain Baynton, and all
the crew except three, are saved. Â»
x This vcffcl was reckoned one of the fwifteft fail
ing (hips in his majesty's navy ; (he was taken from
the French the 20th of October 1793, by
Crefent frigate, commanded by captain Saumarez,
having, after a smart engagement, (buck, en the

ticulars :â
Louvet, in his paper of the I ith, fays, A let
ter from Milan announces, that the flag of distress
is flying on the ramparts of Mantua. He adds,
that news which appears to be more certain, is that
Kleber, with 30,000 men, has'parted the Rhine at
Oppenbeim, to anÃoy the operations of the arch
duke against Kehl.
Letters fiem Strafcurg announce, that the bridge
of Kehl has been dÂ«ftroyed, which makes it more
likely that the place will fall into the hands of the
Auftrians. -
A letter from Neuwied dates that the Archduke
has refufed axt armistice requested by Moreau
ThcEnglflh have quitted the Isle of Elba, but
have left a convoy there. It is said they are about

Porcupine's Gazette.
Proposals by WILLIAM COBBETT, opposite Christ
Church, Philadtlphia, for publilhing a news-paper,
to be entitled x
Porcupine's Gazette, hf Daily Advertiser.
Methsnks 1 hear the reader exclaim ; " What! have
we not Gazettes enough already ?" Yes, and far tÂ®o
many : but those that we have, are, in general, con
duced in such a manner that their great number, in
stead of tendering mine unneceflary, is the only cause
that calls for its eftablilhment.
The gazettes in this country have done it more real in
jury than all its of>en enemies ever did or can do. They
mislead the people at home and misrepresent them a
broad. It was these vehicles of sedition and discord
that encouraged the counties in the Weft to rebel ; it
was th6y that gave rife to the depredations of Britain,
by exciting the people to such aits-os violence against
that nation, as left no room to doubt that we were,de
termined on war ; anil it was they, when an accom
modation had been happily efledied, that stirred up an
opposition to it such as has seldom been witnefled, and
which was overcome by mere chance. These gazettes
it was, that, by misrepresenting the dispositions of the
people, encouraged the French to proceed from one
degree of insolence to another, 'till atJafLtheir JJdinif
ter, braves the President in his chair, aÂ»d a bullying
commander comes and tells us that his only business is
to fe'w.e our vessels, in violation of a treaty, in virtue
ot which alone he claims a right to enter our ports : and
it is thei'e gazettes that now have the impudence to pe
fend what (heir falfehood and malice have produced
I shall be told that the people are to blame ; that
they are not obliged to read these abominable publica
tions. But they do read them; and thousands who
read them, read nothing else. ,To suppress them is im
poffilole ; they will vomit forth their poison ; it is a pri
vilege of their natures, that no law can abridge ; and
therefore the only mode left is* to counteract its effefls.
This must be done, too, in their own way. Books,
or periodical publications in the form of books, may
be of some service, but are by no means a match for
their flying folios. A falfebood that remain? uncontra
dicted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth,
and when the dete&ion at last makes its appearance, it
is often as ufflefs as that of the dodlor who finds his
' patient expired. The only method of opposition, then,
is to meet them on their own ground ; to set feot to
foot ; dispute every inch and every hair's breadth ;
fight them at their own weapons, and return them two
blows for one -
A gazette of this stamp is what I hive long wilbed to
fee, but I have wilhed and uxpeiSled it in vain. Indig
nation at the fupinenefs of others has at last got the
, better of all diffidence in my own capacity, and has dc
! termined me to eneounter the t*k. People have heard
one Tide long enough ; they (hall now hear the other.

CHATHAM,
MOST delightfully situated on the north bank of Rap
pahanock river, opposite the town of Frederickfburg, In
the slate Â»of Virginia, confiding of eleven or fifteen hun
dred acres, as may best suit the puichafer. There is on
this eft ate, a large and well built brick house, containng
nine commodious rooms, exclufiveof a spacious hall or en
try,. 21 feet square, two pair of Aairs, Hiitabie and conven
ient passages, and excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine healthy eminence, commanding beautiful views in
every direction over the towns of Frederickfburgh and
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country.âThe
grounds adjoining the house are neatly laid out in pleas
ure Â«nd kitchen gardens interspersed with a variety ojF
scarce trees, a choice collection of flowers aHd flowering
Ihrubs, and enriched by various forts of the following
fruits, viz' apples, pears, walnuts, chofnuts, eherries,peach
es, plumbs, ne&arines, apricots, grapes, figs, rafberrie#*
goofeberries,ftrawberries,and currants; the whole admi
rably varied by turfed slopes which have been formed by
great labour and expence. Bordering upan these im
provements, are several lots, in a highftate of cultivation,
and well fat with red clover and orchard grass, from
which three heavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large and flourilhing orchards; one
Â©f well chosen peach trees, the other of apple and pear*
trees, fele&edfrom the best nurseries in the state. Pro
perly detached from the mansion house are extenfire
roomy offices of every denomination, viz. a Kitchen and
Larder, house-keeper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
underneath for a variety of purposes, a flore-boufe and
lmoke house all of brick, a dairy and spring house of Itoae. > '
Stables for thirty horses, and coach houses for fqur car
riages. Alfoalarge and well planned farm yard, uith
barn and granary, a cow house, with separate |stalls for
th irty-fix grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals.
muttons larokÂ»-fr-pxtenii.vg Ihdde. Â«h4 other
arrangements for stock of every description, with a large
and convenient receptable for provender, from which they
can be furnifhed without being exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's Ihop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourers. '
The arable lands are fÂ«Â») advantageously divided as ta af
ford an opportunity of making a large quantity of Indian
corn annually, without bringing the field into similar cul
ture oftner than once in four years; consequently the
lands may be improved by keeping up the inclofures during
the intermediate years, or may be benÂ«ficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On the premises there isalfo a merchant mill with on#
pair of best French burr stones, and one pair of Cologne;
furnifhed with modern machinery, and now leafed for the
unexpired term ot four years, at 1501 per annum, and all <
grain for thfe use of the farm, hopper free, which is near-' ~
ly iool. more. The mill and miller's house are built of
free stone, within a very small distance of navigation, near
to which are two or more valuable Ufhcrles, and a well
atcuftomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. The land contains inexhaustible quarries
of free ftene near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water atiid poflfeffes a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be considerably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel andfociable. Infadl, exclufiveof .
an improveable and well conditioned farm, the value and
emolument inseparably conne<fled witn a mill, ferries,
fifheries and quarries eligibly situated ; the profits anting
from ?in ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetable*
ofalifortÂ£ as to'lje Â£ully equal to the demand in market,
there might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it unnecessary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to b6 a complete,
pleasant and healthy residence, pofieffiiij beauties and
conveniences fufficient to attra& the attention of any per
son desirous of becoming a purchaser.
The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a defjre to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood of that city.
The purchaser may he accommodated with a few fiaves
in families, feither for plantation or doraeftic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly secured.
