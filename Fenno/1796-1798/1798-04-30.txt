put and carried, there being 4.6 votes for it.
The Sergeant at Arms accordingly pro
ceeded to colleCt the ballots, which being
done, Mtflrs. Jofiah Parker and Morris were
called upon to count the votes, wjiich Mr.
Parker reported to be as follow, viz. for Mr.
Dent 40, Mr. Sitgreaves 19, Mr. Baldwin 1 a,
Mr. J. Williams 1, and Mr. Blount 1.
Mr. Dent was accordingly declared to be
elected, and having been conducted to the
Chair by Mr. Sitgreaves, he addretfed the
House as fellows:
" Gentlemen,
" IN the execution of the dutiesof this tem
porary appointment, my endeavour will be to
evince linct impartiality.âPermit me to hope
your co-operation in- maintaining order, and
to expeCt yÂ»ur support in all cales of official
decisions, where it to be afforded."
On motion of tV|r. S'tgreaves it was resolv
ed, that a inefTage be sent to the Senate, in
forming them that the House had elected a
Speaker ; ro (em.
The House ihen resolved itfelf into a com
mittee of the whole on the date of the Union,
on the bill to provide an additional armament
for the fuâJier protection of the trade of the
United States, and for other purposes, when
the consideration of Mr. Gallatin's amend
ment tothe i(t feclionbe;ng resumed, viz. to
insert " prov ded th-v (hall not, in time of
peace, be employed as convoy to any foreign
port or place."
Mr. Allen. âMr. Chairman, I wish toin
form the Committee the realons for the drong
exprellions of abhorrence and indignation,
which fell from me yederday, at the language
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Gallatin) when the House was in committee
of the whole on this bill.
1 confefs, Sir, I have not that perfeft com
mand of myfelfâl have not that iron fydem
of nerves, which I could wish, the want of
which I lament, and which I so muchadnire
in oihers. Conditionally too irritable, I
mÂ»et such insults to my country with a degree
of warmth which I delire to repress, but
which I hope does not banish from my bosom
that consideration and that candour which is
neceifiry in my place. The situation of our
country requires a cool and temperate delibe
ration; and 1 wiih for nothing more than for
tjhe adbptionoffuch measures as true wisdom
shall point out as proper. The committee, I
trust, will pardon me for the adonifhment and
displeasure i felt at what 1 heard from that
gentleman ; a fimilaV displeasure marked the
countenances of almoit a:I who heard him.-
I did expert, upon the disclosure in the dif
paiches of what had patTed at Paris between
our Commiflioncrs and the Government of
France, that a spirit of unanimity would have
been, in some degree, produced in our coun
cils, ihough a perfect unanimity could not be
expected. 1 did fxpeet that every member
of the Legislature wcnild have laid his hand
upon his heart, and considered what was ne
cetfary to be done tor the fafety of his coun
try, and would have determined to support
fiich measures as should be deliberately adopt
ed by the majority. But, Sir, what do we be
hold f 1 have loflg considered as the riiod
prominent feature in the Jacobinicthe
spirit of obdinacy, which knows not to yield ;
that furious, clamorous spirit, which never
acquiesces in meaiures ncr principles, howe
ver well fettled; which never yields to majo
rities, but which always seeks by force or art
to convert minorities into majorities; that
spirit which drives men tooveri'et, dedroy, or
lender ineffectual, measures which it disap
proves, though adopted by the general con
lent and approbation of the country; that
spirit whichceafesnot to reprobate in the moil
bitter manner measures whichgentlemen know
and acknowledge cannot now be set aside. I
pray God this spirit may have an end; if it
continues)! will ruin thiscountry. It appears
to me, that the courle gentlemen Â»e now ta
king will overwhelm us with irretrievable
difficulties. I hope lam miltaken ; but it ap
pears to me the duty of every American, at
this time, seriously to declare that he will
Ityport the meatures which have been
which may be adopted by the government,
The Senate have pasTed, by a large majori
ty, and sent to u*, a bill to provide an addi
tional armament, and no exprellion of disap
probation of it is heard out of doors. The ob
jects of it are, the defence of those parts of our
coast which are mod exposed to tne enemy ;
ottr trade from port to port; our trade to fo
reign countries where within the reach of
our (hores; and the general defence of the
ration. The fird dep is to provide the means
of defence. How it will operate I know not;
it cannot be particularly forefeen. Let us
pofTcfs the power and conlult the mode of con
ducting it afterwards. All men mud confefs
our situation requires it. It is intended to
place this force in the hands of the govern
ment, to be used as the exigencies of the na
tion may demand. But it is attempted, by
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, at the very
outset, at the very tbrefhold of the business,
to (hackle it, to make a declaration which
goes to a prostration of the country âHe re
quires that we declare we will not make life
of these vefTels to defend our acknowledged
rights ; that whatever may be our situation,
whatever may be the event, condition or con
tingency, howevereffeCtuai may be the means
of defending our (hips, our property, these
ve(Tels.(hall not U.- used as convoys. Is this
â¢wife âis thisp>udent ? For 1 wish to avoid the
difcuflion of all Confiitutional queflions, and to
speak only of the expediency of the nieafure.
Will gentleman reful'e their aflent to the bill
unlets accompanied with a declaration that
the veiiels shall not be used in a particular
lTianncr? Surely every gentleman who is anx
ous only for the true interelt of his own coun
try murtconfent to leave the manner of em
ploying these Veirels to be fettled hereafter,
by Congress, or by the Prelidenf, when our
situation with refpett to France (hall be fully
known. The events of next month, next
week, nay, of tomorrow, may re'ndir this
reflriCtion idle, absurd, and dangerous. If
gentlemen are unwilling to tru(t the Prelident
are they afraid of tbemfelyes ? If their jealou
sy leads them to put manacles on the Execu
tive, mull they also fetter themselves f Can
we not discuss this quedien at a future day,
and make a law providing for the operation
of tljis force, long before it will be prepared
for action? Why occupy the time which is
wanted for preparing the armament in quar
relling about its courle and dellination?â
What will be the life of these velfels without
the proposed rel'nCtion, I cannot tell ; but I
am not afraid to ccntide this power lo the
Piefident; I am not apprehcufivc tliey will
lie improperly employed. If there were any
such danger as gentlemen seem to contem
, plate, the public fentimeatÂ«jhc general opi- 1
nioti of the country, would mlluance the Ex
ecutive conduct on the occasion. Under all
the attacks that arc condantly made upon us,
and the threats of dcdniction that alarm our
country, surely there can be no danger of
these vellels defending us and all our rights
too zealously, or too effectually.
Ihe queliion is, shall we fuffer these armed
ve2els to act as convoys in time of peace ; and
by peace he confers he means that date in
wh'ch we now (land; plundered, insulted,
menaced as we now are?
It is laid policy forbids it. I believe policy
calls upon us to defend our/elves in the belt man
ner we are able, unoperated upon by any thing
which has taken place heretofore. Policy calls
upon us to coiifult our own fafety and inte
rest, without giving way to an affection for
one nation or hatred to another. These are
absurd arid dangerous padiuns in nations. It
is our true policy to defend ourselves and our
rights to the fulled extent ; we have an aw
ful lefTon of what we are to expeCt from fub
mifTion and tamenefs.
It is said, that it is a vain attempt so defend
our commerce ; because we cannot de
fend it effectually* Sir, no nation ever did
defend its commerce effectually in the fenf'e
the gentleman means; no nation ever expect
ed or attempted it. Ev4ry country at war
will lofie very many of its merchant ships; it
is fufficient that we exert so great a force in
their defence as under all circumffances we
can afford, and can bring into aCtion. But,
Sir, no nation ever said, in the spirit of this
amendment,that it would not protect its rights
and commerce. It would be an invitation to
all the pirates on earth to plunder it, under a
proinife of impunity. Whatever may be ex
pedient to be done in faCt, however much we
may really be difpefed to endure in hope to
escape a war, we should not publish to the
world and to our foe, our intention tÂ«i submit
to his robberies. The man who would fay
this, would never have the spirit to defend
the country in cafe of an aCtual invafionâlt
is a spirit calculated only to surrender our
independence to the fird power who shall
have courage to demand it.
It was said by the gentleman from Virginia
(Mr. Nicholas) that by refufing to protect
our commerce, we should lofeonly the carry
ing trade ; that the ships of other nations would
come to our ports and furnifh us with such
fore'rjÂ»n productions as we might want, and
take front us such of ours as we might Tiave to
spare ; and that the objeCt of the protection
was not worth the expence and the hazard.
This was not always the language of that gen
tleman, He formrrly thought the carrying
trade of the utmost importance to the country.
E vety one remembers the long & earned debate
which four years ago took place on a set of re
solutions brought in by a gentleman from Vir
ginia (Mr. Madison). They were founded
on certain commercial regulations, said to
have been adopted by Great-Britain, injuri
ous only to the carrying trade which we are
now invited to surrender without a druggie.
[Here Mr. A. read some observations of Mr.
Nicholas on that occasion, in which, speaking
of the wrongs this country had fuffered from
Great-Britain, he a(ks if there was so little
American feeling in the house as not to lead
them to take retaliatory measures, &c.] Let
gentlemen compare our situation at that time
with the present, and they will discover that
all which that gentleman then fatd was appli
cable at this time, and infinitely more. Those
who then opposed the measures of the gentle
man from Virginia, called for fpetific facts of
the injuries complained ofâthey were told
of the savages being let leofe upon our fron
tiers, and the Algerines upon our Commerce,
and of commercial advarilages being denied
us ; yes, Sir, the fame gentleman from Vir
ginia was then indignant at our commercial
lofTes, andatredraint on our trdde. No gen
tleman now calls for " fpecific fafts ;" no
gentleman now calls for evidence againd
France ; every gentleman now agrees we have
jud cause of war againd her; but now they
profefs to doubt the policy of protecting that
trade which they then thought so important ;
ntrw it is not worth defending ; nam it is mere
baggatelle; now they are willing to let fo
leigners regulate our markets, take our ships,
imprison our seamen, and take poflelTion of
our harbours. Now we are feriouflyjinvited to
draw our heads within our diells, and humbly
take what foreigners will please to give us;
and all this without an effort to defend rights
so dear and sacred. These were not the sen
timents which animated the gentleman on the
former occasion ; and I cannot account for
this difference of conduct in fituatibns so simi
lar. The gentleman on that occasion dated
the quedion to be whether commercial regu
lations diould be adopted, or whether we
should go to <war. Arms were to be the re
source if milder measures failed in their effeCt.
These gentlemen were then ready to resist and
to repel the aggreflions committed on us, and
their meafutes were drenuoufly urged. At that
time Great-Britain did not avow the wrongs
(he had committed on us, nor did (he threaten
to continue them and ravage our coasts, both
which France now does. Our complaints a
gainst Great-Britain were few and light, com
pared with those we make againd France ; yet,
had the commercial regulations then proposed
by these gentlemen proved inefficient, blood
1 would have been shed in defence of the rights
then violated, though of no importance com
pared with the injuries under which we now
groan. It is contended by the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) and I believe
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Gallatin) that by the law of nations,
France has a right to search our veflels in or
der to discover whether they have on board
contraband articles, ox enemy's property. But
has she not declared (lie will not be governed
by the law of nations ; that she will make her
oower her only rirfe of condufit ? And will it
be said that (he inay avail herfelf of rights gi
ven by a law the injunctions of which (he will
iNit obey ? May fht protect herfelt under that
law while she will retufe to all other nations
the protedtion it promises to tbem? Do we
allow the Algerines or the" pirates of Asia to
learch our vellels ? We may reply, to every
Frenchman, who demands to search our diips,
"You (liall not; you declare you will condemn
for causes which you admit not authorized
by the law of nations, and you (hall not search
for any cause whatever." Certainly while gen
tlemen admit that we have jud cause of war
againd her, they cannot confidently cohtend
for her right to fearch,and our duty to submit.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania, fays,
" we ought not to permit our vefTcls to serve
as convoys, because to convoy our merchant
men is to proteCt them againd the unlawful
attacks, and againd all attacks of foreign ships ;
that to defend our veflels againd the ag
grelfions of France by force is to fight, and to
fight is to go totoor; and a date of war is a
greater evil than the present date of things.
And he adds, we had better fuller the French
to go on with their depredations, unjud and
enormous as they are, than to take any step
which may lead to uuar."
This I cannot admitr This course of ar
gument is chosen, 1 believe, to give currency
to the opinion that the Executive and a part
of this House are determined on 'war in behalf
of Great Britain. Tlfis is continually infinity*
ted, or boldly asserted, tho' contrary to the
repeated and molt foletnn alterations of the
late and present chief magistrates, and of many
of the members of this bady, that they anxt
oudy wilh peace with the .French republic.
This alarm is rung throughout the Un'.ted
States, and is eveiy where preached up and
declaimed agninft, in order to excite meetings
and to raise up a part of the people to refill
the mea&iresof the government, however jull
and necedary they may be 1 think lam
warranted in tliisaflertton by a number ofcir
cumdances ; look at the petitions from a
number of places againd fudering your mer
chantmen to arm in their defence againda na
tion of robbers. Every where exertions are
made to excite diffatisfaftion, and a flame a
gainst our government. Every where are
found men base or deluded enotigh to present ,
their faces in broad day light, and revile the
measures and the adminidrators of the go
vernment. Every where do they recount the |
measures they condemnâthe funding fyflem,
the bank laav, the excise, the Britifb treaty, the '
building of frigates, the Federal City, and theÂ«
stamp ail, are rung in the ear of the public as (
monltrous, unjulf, impolitic and dedruitive ;
altho' they have had the repeated and decid
ed approbation of majorities in Congress, and
of the people ; and altho' almod all-men, even
those who extite or join in the clamour, ac
knowledge that every principle ofjudice now
forbids their repeal. Inffead of alarming the
public mind, gentlemen would do mudh bet
ter service to their country by quieting and
appeasing it ; and by indruiting the people
in the true principles of the laws, in the ab
solute necellity of fnbmitting to and reding
fatisfied with the decilion of majorities, tin- (
less those decisions obviously and manifeftly
led to the dedruition of the country; and I
diould doubt even in such a cafe of the pro
priety of a forcible interference, because of the
danger of exerciling the right of infurrefliort.
When measures are deliberately adopted, u
nanimity ought to prevail in carrying them
into eft eft ; but nothing is in fait heard but j
the jarring founds of discord and division;
if the laws are sot openly opposed and difo- \
it is a grumbling, reluilant fub.nidion
which is yielded, indicative of a temper
tv hich is ready for refidance, revolution and
blood. This disposition, tho' seen in all pla
ces, commands but a few voices ; for the ho
nour of our country a very great majority of
the people remain uninfluenced by these facti
ous difiurbers of the public peace ; and,
thank God I they have experienced a
fital and tfifmal defeat hi a particular part of
the union.
B it, fays the gentleman from Pennfylvanisj,
(Mr Gallatin) we had better red contented
as we aie, "we had better fuffer the French
to continue their captures of our (hips and
imprifo.iment of our seamen, we had better
fuffer thein to go on with their depredations
than to go to war." Sir, what loud and in
infolent complaints have been made againd
us, for " fuffering" the Britilh to commit the
very fame kind of violences en us ; our ears
yet tingle with the reproaches heaped upon
us for fuffering precisely the fame attro
cities which we are now invited lo meet with
tame fubmidion. These gentlemen hare
heretofore told us that the French were eX
cused for their robberies by our "fuffering"
the Britifli to drengthen their forces and man
(heir (hips with their seamen. Is not this a
donilhing? What measure of depredation and
plunder may the British now adopt by this
rule,if we "fuffer" the French to drip usatthe
present rate? They have hitherto proceeded
in at lea 2 a quadruple ratio. By this rule we
be required to "fuffer" the Britilh to
take ou'rlad (hip, our lad man, and our lad
farthing.
" Wediad better fuffer the French to go on
with their depredations than go to war." Sir,
this is all the French claim for themselves.
They now take all they can find ; they are
perfectly contented with their present condi
tion. If they can take and dedroy the whole
of oar trade, they will be fatisfied. The con
tinual plunder of our commerce will be worth
more than all the money we can pay. But
let gentlemen recolleft that France has ex
pressed t-he dronged hopes of conquering her
enemy, Great-Britain ; that power which a.
lone now opposes itfelf to this monder which
has devoured half Europe. What will be
our condition, what will be our means of de
fence,when (he has dripped us of all our
(hips and faanien ? To me it appears clear,
that if we "fuffer" France " to goon" it
will end in the complete dedruition of all
those articles in which confid our bed means
of defence. lam not for doing this, I am
not for giving up all our diips and seamen to
French rapacity ; because I believe if we give
up these we have those within our bofotn who
would give up our country too. I again call
oh the gentleman ftom Virginia (Mr. Nicho
las) to remember the spirit which actuated
him and the language he spoke, on the for
mer occasion. That spirit, were it now a
wake, would hold a different tone from what
we heafat present. We are advised to refrain
from using the power we poflefs for defending
ourselves on the ocean ; and to declare that
we will fold up our arms and submit to be
dripped. No nation that had endured the
wrongs we feel, and againd whom such threats .
had been pronounced, ever said " wewillnot
refid, we cannot afford effectual defence, and
therefore we will give no defence at all." I
hope we (hall not yet fubferibe to such a de
claration.
Sir, I (hould have dood adonifhed at the
language I have heard from these gentlemen ;
I fhouldhave wondered what could have in
duced it, but for what I have in my handâ
Is there not something peculiar and alarming
in an invitation at this time to surrender our
rights and independence to a foreign nation ;
for I believe the conduft recommended a -
mounts to this 1 If we turn to the dispatches
from France, however, we (hall fee it all ac
counted for. Mr. A. then read the follow
ing paragraph from the conversation of Mr.
Y. with our ministers at Paris. â â¢Perhaps
you believe that in returning and expoling to
your countrymen the irrireal'onablenefs of the
demands of this government, you will unite
them in their refidance to those demands :
You are midsken ; you ought to know that
the diplomatic skill of France, and the
means (he possesses iii your country, arefuf
ficient to enable her, with the French party in
America, to throw the blame which will at
tend the ruptujre of the negociations on the
FederaliJls, as you term yourselves, butonthe
Brit'jb party as Fiance terms you ; and you
may allure yourselves this will be done."
This, Mr. Chairman, fitrnidies the solution
of all the quedions which arise, of all the en
quiries that are made, into the motives of cer
tain gentlemen on this floor. If the French
had applied their " diplomaticfiill." the means
" they poflefs in this country" with the mod
perfett addrefsand dexterity,what morecould
they have promised themselves than has oc
curred I Were France herfelf to speak thro'
an American inouth I cannot conceive what
(he would fay other than -what we have heard
from tertaiiigentlemen to effcCt herpurpofes.
On every propolitiott for a prompt, energetic
and effectual defence of cur cuualrv, we are
met with fo/i,lituti<i>!al que/hms, theories, doubts,
nice ifritnitjions, learned metaphysical d]qU'f>ti'
ons, ar.d hrtg fpetckes to excite di.visions, en
courage the r party, occupy time, and pro
tract tins debate to an interminable and pro
voking extent; and this by men who have
been long devoted to Iter cause. This is the
greatest aKjcnt to which her mod artful
would thiok.it prudent togo ; open and di
rect opposition to all defence would defeat it
felf ; (Ire mud be condemned and her mea
sures reprobated ; (lie mult be confeffed to
have committed outrages on eur rights ; but
policy, policy, the fvreet enchanting song of po
licy, must be chaunted in our ears forever â
policy forbids refinance to the only wounds
ftie inflictsâthe attacks us only by fta, it is
there only that we at present are vulnerable ;
and there this syren policy is to (ing us adeep.
We are invited to lurrender the ocean, and
" all that in it is" without one fae-ble effort
of defence. We are advised not to resist the
demands of France, tho' calleu upon to pay
her large fuins of money. [Mr. Living
ston interrupted Mr. A. and said he had fat
(till a long time and heard a mod uncommon
ft rain of calumny and attacks ; but this was
too serious a charge to pass unnoticed. He
wiftied Mr. A. to state fpecifically who had
expressed such a ientiment, for he lud not
heard it. ] On the penalty of my life, faiil
Mr. A. i would not in this place and on this
occaflon falfely ftste the arguments of gentle
men. I allude, Sir, to vhat waj (aid, and
so laboriously supported, by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin). His ve
ry words were, " we had better fuffer the
French to go on ivith their depredations, than to
take any ltep which may lead to war." 1
thought I had so often repeated the exprelii
ort that no gentleman could be ignorant of
â what I alluded to. If it does not amount to
what I have stated I hope I (hall be pardon
ed. But it seems impodible to put the Tene
ment into plainer and more explicit language
â¢than that in which the gentleman himfelf
clothed it.
'France takes our (hips, condemns them,
and treats our seamen as prifuners of war ;
that is, (lie (huts them up in her goals ;we
complain of her conduit and demand that (he
cease her outrages, and make us fatisfaition ;
ftie replies that (he will continue these cap
tures unless we pay her money ; and the gen
tleman now fays " fuffer her to go on." To
retufe compliance would be to refufe to fuf
fer her to continue her wrongs or enferce any
of her demands, that is, it would be to ltand
on our defence and repel her attacks; but
the gentleman fays, " fuffer her to go on"â
this I call advice not to refill her demands.
Her demands, taking her language and con
duit together, are, " pay me money, or let
me take your (hips," for neither of which
does (he pretend any juftification ; and the
gentleman fays, " let her take your (hips."
Is this the language of an American who
loves his country f No Sir, it is the language
of a foreign agent. Genuine Americans
Sir, disdain such language ; they love their
country and will defend it, unless the art of
these gentlemen (hall paralize our arm. Gen
tlemen fay we cannot defend ourselves, we
cannot raise the necessary funds to maintain a
war. â¢ Sir, we have houses, farms and cattle,
and we Villfpend the last farthing ;we have
spirits, blood and bodies, and we will lay
them in the field of battle, for our country.
Do gentlemen fay we cannot defend our
selves ? Sir, this is language which Ameri
cans are not used to hear ; they 'will defend
the rights, the honour, the independence of
their country, or perifb, " the diplomatic fiill
of France, her means, and her party in this
cÂ»untrv," notwithdanding.
In aid of this argument of policy it is urg
ed that there (till remains some chance, some
hope of preserving peace ; and this chance,
this hope is attempted to be made a balis of
afiion. L with any (Vicl. exiiled on which a
(ingle operation could be built; but I disco
ver none. The gentleman from Virginia
(Mh Nicholas) told us yefteiday that he did
not believe the present date of things could
lojig exiit, that peace must soon take place, in
Europe, on which, such was his opinion'of
France, judice would be done lis. [Mr.
Nicholas interrupted Mr. A. laying he had
said no such thing. ] Mr. A. said the gen
tleman's words were, "we (hall be redored
to our rights." [Mr. N. replied that he
meant that the powers at war would then
cease to -violate our rights. ] Mr. A. continu
ed ; that may have been the gentleman's idea,
but imported remuneration,
a compenjation for the 'violation of our rights.
But, Sir, aÂ£ the gentleman himfelf his now
dated his idea, what foundation is there for it.
I do not underdand France thus to speak for
herfelf. I underdand her to make her padi
ons her guide, and her power her only rule ;
and tho' while die is engaged in combating
the mod powerful nation in Europe, (he can
not wage an open war with us ; yet when (he
has brought that power to her feet, (he re
minds us of our "fate by the mention of Ve
nice, and other powers of Europe which have
been obliged to submit to her dominion.
LMr. A. re;id another padage from the dis
patches in which it is said diould not aninva
(ion of England aitually take place, yet the
alarm, interruption of trade, and the expence
which it would create would ultimately wear
them out, and oblige them to make peace.]
The latter I tear will be the event; I believe
they w ill not conquer that country by attack ;
but thejx- is too much reason to believe they
drive will it to an ignominious peace by the
long continued conflict. And can wt expert
that Franco, when die has made peace with
England, will fit down in quiet and cultivate
only the arts of peace,and breathe nothing but
good will to men ( When die has humbled
the only porter that presents a formidable
front and terrible afpeit, islhetofetafeoutthe
introduction of that millenium of peace and
purity of which we have heard lo many fine
promises and peotical predictions. On the
contrary, if our difficulties are not fettled
with her before the subjugation of, ora peace
with Great-Britain takes place, and by that
meant her fleets which now serve us as a bar
rier, are withdrawn from the contelt, they will
not be fettled at all ; and if the course to
which we are invited is taken, and we now
" fuffer" her to (trip vis of our Ihips and sea
men, we (hall be incapable of defending our
selves. We have every thing to expect th.it
the avarice, the ambition, the malice and the
power of France can inflict. Sir, if Great-
Britain falls, and we remain a divided people,
I look for nothing but bloodlhed, daughter,
pillage and a complete subjection to Franceâ
how can we prevent it. Nothing else can be
expected while gentlemen continue their pre
sent line of conduit ; wliild to every nieafure
of defence the expence is objected, and the
people arc told they cannot pay it ; while a
land tax is held out to the people as the great
ed of all evils, and by these and every poili
ble art the public arm is paralized, the pub
lic force dedroyed.
Let me add, as no contemptible engine in
this bulinefsof sowing discord, diffentionsand
dilfnilt'of the government, a vile incendiary
paper publilhed in thi* city, which condant
ly teems with the molt atrocious abules of ail
the measures of the government, and. its ad
miniftrators. A flood of calumny istfoiiflaiit
lv poured forth againll those whom the pen.
plejiave chosen as the guardians of the natio.i.
Tire privilege of franking letters is abused
in folding this paper into all parts of the
country ; and the pureli characters are, thro*
this medium, prodrated and laid low in the
view of .the people. No nation, no govern
merit was ever so insulted. In another coun
try, this printer and his supporters would long
agw have found a Fourth of September, and this
paper is well known always to speak the sen
timents of, and to be l'upported by, certain
gentlemen in this house. These, Sir, are the
Fruits of" the diplomatic (kill ps France"â
thefearetheeffeÂ£tspfher " means"âthese are
the efforts of " her party in this country." lam
aware that our government may not always, 011
all occasions, have. aÂ£ted with the most perfeft
wisdom ; what government ever did J we are
not perfect, it iithelotofhumanify toerr. But
wÂ«uld have conduced, our affairs more,
wifely ? Will gentlemen never their re
proaches f The gentlerpan from Pennlylva
nia,'.not many days (ince, declared that if we
have war. witlj France, it ivill be owing to the
publication of the dif patches and inftru&ions ! I
wi(h we may avoid a war, if poltibleâbut if
we do not, if war mtift come, I cannot believe
it will be produced by that publication. The
publication of those papers is acknowledged
by the gentleman to be an innocent ait in it
felf. A proceeding so proper and so honora
ble cannot draw upon us hodility and venge
ance; our enemy needs 110 such pretext, (he
scorns it â(he finds in her ambition, and her
luf} of domination, motives enough for war.
I desire that all the citizens ot the United
States (hould learn that this gentleman has
(aid " the publication of these papers will
lead France to make war on us," and I am
Aire they cannot) midake the motives to the
declaration. It is not the language of
tifm to lay that the publication of what the.
people were anxiously looking for and ex
pelling is to produce a war. The language
of every man who laves his country ought to
be, " A majority has determined what shall
be done, and we will support it; if it was our
error it was not a vice, and we will defend it."
But it Was not an error. Such is not the lan
guage to be produced by the " diplomatic
Iki 11 of France." That./?.'// (hews itfelf in great
apparent moderation and candour, but will
(lyly promote principles calculated to palsy
our efforts and defeat atl the exei tions for the
protection of our country's rights and inde
pendence. Such things will be practised un
til all men will to prefer their own coun
try to every other. Cut I, believe there are
men in this country, in this house, whofc ha
tred and abhorrence of our government leads
them to prefer another, profligate and fero
cious as it is.
The gentlemen who press upon us these
two ideas, viz. " we, have some chance of
peace and, an European peace writ reltore
to us our right!," have heretofore a (filmed to
underdand the temper, policy and projects of
the French government; and thereupon have
claimed authority to direst our affairs in rela
tion ts France; and have bitterly and loudly
condemned our want pt faith in them. Let us
examine the grounds of their claimsÂ»-let us
fee htowTfar their predictions heretofore have
been verified. â¢ â¢
- Genet and his partlzans in this country,
told us Franee did not wifli us to join her in
the war. A few months after this, he pulled
his indruCtions from his pocket, and they were
found to enjoin upon him to.employ all pulTi
ble means to draw us info the war. These
gentlemen underdood Great-Britain tooâ
they kneix< (he would not treat with us at all,
much less on any terms of reciprocity". When
that treaty was made and ratified, they so
clearly saw her perfidy, and her hypocrisy,
they were certain (lie would not perform on
her part those imputations which were favor
able to us ; they knew ihe would not deliver
up the Western Polls, &c. Sir, we- (ee that
power performing her engagements with a re
ligiously good faith, that Fiance and her fero
cious tyrants never knew. N
These gentlemen have confiantly afl'ured us
that all the robberies, the decrees of fpolia.
tiou, the violations of her treaty with lis, her
embargoes, her comptflfory contracts with
our merchants in her ports, and her disregard
of all her contrails, were rheafures necefl'ary
to her very exidence, that they were the re
fuh of " an imperious necefiity ;" and that
when that neceflity ceased, when her liberties
were secured, when (he had repelled and
humbled the despots of Europe who were
leagued againd her, (he would cease her out
rages, and would render jufl ce so all who had.
futf'ered by her wrongs. Let the gentlemen
hold up their heads, and declare to us what
is now the cafeâShe extends and encreafes
her ravages; her voracious jaws have en
gulphed all that has come within her reach.
Sir, I will remind the gentleman from Vir
ginia (Mr. Nicholas) and the gentfemen who
then acted, and now ait with him, that to the
answer to the President's speech, at the feflion
lad Summer, he moved an amendment in the
following words, viz. " v The rejection of our
Miniiter, and the manner of liifmifling him
from the territories of France, have excited
our warmed sensibility; and, if followed by
similar measures, and a rsfufal of all neeocia
tion on the fubjedt of our mutual complaints,
will put an end to every friendly relation be
tween the two countries ; but we flatter our
selves that the Government of France only
intended to suspend the ordinary diplomatic
intercourse, and to bring into operation thole
extraordinary agencies which are in common
use between nations, and which are confined
in their attention to the great causes of differ
ence. We therefore receive with the utmolt
fatisfaftion your information that a fredi at
tempt at negociation will be instituted; and
we expeit with confidence that a mutual (pi
nt ot conciliation, and a (tifpofition on the
part of the United States to place France on
the footing ot other countries, by removing
the inequalities which may have arisen in the
operation ot our respective treaties with them,
will produce an accommodation compatible
with the engagement#, rights, duties and ho
nour of the United States."
1 his amendment was nioft zentoudy flip
ported, and the debate upon it occupied this
House near three weeks at the extrairdinary
feflion lad Summer. I then thought it ill
timed, but I now believe it was a fortunate
motionâ~it serves as a tejl by which to try
these gentlemen. The plain language of it
was, " We will make another attempt to ne
gociate, and a repetition of her abuses will
convince us that we cannot have any friendly
connexions with France." Sir, putting an end
to all friendly relations between two countries,
I underdand to be placing them in a (late of
bojltlity. 1 know of no mongrel half-breed (late
ot things after such an end is put to our rela
tions with a foreign nation ; it is war, or it is
peace. I'he citizens of one have a right to be
received in the ports of the other in a friend
ly manner, -riliey have notâif they have, it
U peace; if they have not, it is war. The
Prelident has made a frcdi attempt at negoci -
tion ; l.c has sent three Ministers in place of
the one, io beg and pray for compromiling,
for negotiation forjttliice and for peace. The
haughty Directory will not receive then), willnot hear them j its vile agents insult them
With demands of enormous lams, Sir, France
not only will not negociate, but Ihe will not
even suspend her depredations while one of
our Envoys can return home to procure such
powers as (he demands to be given them. She
admits the justice of our complaints, and de
clares we (hall fubinit to her power. The
event on which the gentleman counted in his
amendment has happened, but he now warm
ly contends for a continuation of friendly rela
tions between the two countries. It is proved
the government of France did not intend only
to suspend thtordinary diplomatic intercourle
and to bring into exertion those extraordinary
agencies. We have resorted to such extraor
dinary agencies ; we have sent three EEnvoys
Extraordinary. Her firft rejection of our Mi
nister has been followed by (imilar ineafures,
and a refufal of all negociation, and the gen
tleman now vehemently contends agatnft even
defence and reffiance !
It is proved that the Gentleman's " confi
dence" in the (uccefs of this 'MVefh attempt"
to negociate was utterly destitute of-foundati
on, and now again he fays " there is some
chance of peace," and " peace in Europe
will restore to us our rights." By this time I
think the Gentleman should hafitate and p'aufe
a little before he pronounces any more creeds
on tfie fubjert of French justice, French ho
nour, French moderation, Frenchmagninimitv.
The Gentleman in his amendment also laid,
" we cannot believe that any serious expeila
" tion can be entertained of withdrawing the
" support of the people from their conffituti
" onal agents"âand now (he boalts-of " her
41 means and her party" in America.
Sir, our dangers are roo imminent, too aw
ful to trifle with 5 our be
prompt, energetic, and decilive, 1 wish the
gentleman from Penrifylvanitt could be con
vinced of the propriety of withdrawing his
motion; and of"!*.: necelli yof unanimity
in our Councils. (Mr. A. read from the dif
patrhes, a part of Mr. Y's address to our En
voys. " What, he, Mr. Y. asked would be
" our situation if peace should be made with
" England before our differences with France
" would be accommodated.") This is * so
lemn enquiry j this is a question on which we
should well considerâl pray the Gentlemen
who arc now opposing our measures to make
the answer ; and I wish them the light of a
divine revelation in the foluti'on. Butif Gen
tlemen will not join us haart and hand, in the
defence of our rights and our Independence, I
do trod a fervor will kindle and spread thro'
tite country which will compel Gentlemen to
a'l and do their duty.
I hope, Sir, the Committee will pardon my
ardour on this occasion ; I am sure a majority
will. I cannot hear the threats which are
thrown out against us ; I cannot hear the de
nunciations of France agamftmy Country, and
fit down calmly rÂ» calculate the pounds, fal
lings and pence which it will cost to defend it.
I do hope. Sir, the fervor of the Country, if
nothing else can affect certain Gentlemen, will
oblige this house to proceed immediately in
such measures as are proper for our defenceâ
I pray God this may (peedily be the cafe ; or
we are a ruined and devoted people. But while
I fee such motions as theprefent brought for
ward, and a pure America\(Mr. Brent) .de
clare that such sentiments as we heard
yeftertky from the Gentleman from Pennsyl
vania " would do honour to the head and
" heart of any man," I defpalr of any consi
derable degree of unanimity in this house.

the Foreign concerns of the United Statesâ
The Hon. jfabez Boifen, Chairman.
Jjmf.s Bvrrili, Jun.efq. Seo'y,
The requefc for convoking the meeting
was read and the objeft of the meeting dat
ed by the chairman. After several gentle
men had delivered thtir opinions upon the
(late of affairs and tTie negociation with '
France, the inftru&ions of the President to
thf Envoys extraordinary appointed to ne
gociate with the French republic were read,
it was then rtfolved, nemine eontradicente, that
Dr. David Howell, Welcome Arnold, John
Brown, Amos Maine Atwell, John Dor
rance. John S. Dexter and James Burrill
jun. efq. be appointed a committee to pre
pare an address, from the inhabitants of
Providence, to the President, exprefllve of
their unqualified approbation of his conduft
in relation to the republic of France, and
to all other foreign concerns of the United
States, and their resolution to support the
dignity and independence of the United
States, with their lives and fortunes ; that
they report said address to this meeting, at
its adjournment, and that the fame when ap
proved of by the meeting be offered to the
inhabitants for their signatures.
The. meeting was then adjourned to Mon
day next, at 10 o'clock in the morning.
Monday, April
The inhabitants again assembled, in a
very full meeting, agreeably to their ad
journment. The committee, Appointed for
that purpose, reported an address which be
ing several times read, was unanimously ap
proved ; ordered to be presented to the in
habitants, for their fignatures,and afterwards
transmitted, by the chairman, to the Sena
tors and Representatives of this State in
Congrtft, to be by them presented to the
President, with the minutes of the proceed
ings of this meeting.
This address as reported and adppted, was
forwarded by the mail, which arrived here
on Saturday lad, with a letter from the
chairman, dated on the 24th instant, to the
Senators and Representatives in Congress,
from the State of Rhode-Island, requeuing
them to present it. They this day waited
on the President, at ten o'clock in the morn
ing, and presented the address to him. It
is as follows.
To the President of the United States.
SIR,
The underwritten inhabitants of the Town
of Providence, voluntarily assembled, in
pursuance of public notice, beg leave to ad
dress you, with sentiments of and
profound refpeft.
The late disclosure of the views and de
signs of France, ,in contrail with the pacific
disposition of the United States, has excit
ed the most-disgusting apprehensions of hof-
from that republic, and the mod un
limited confidence, in the wisdom, integri
ty and patriotism of the administration of
our Government.
In the progress of the negotiation with
that republic, whose legitimate origin we
were the firft to acknowledge, a republic
which, at the dawn of it's political day,
Teemed elevated to the fnblimeft height of
virtue, and disclaimed, in the firft exercise
â¢of its power, all right to interfere in the in
ternal concerns of other nations, we observe
with regret, a departure from the great prin
ciples of liberty and justice, and we observe
this with'the deeper regret, because that
country received its firft leffun of liberty
from ours.
After the numberless and trying proofs
which the United States had given of their
sincere desire to preserve an impartial neu
trality, their repealed applications for re
dress, might, at le&ft, have been answered
with profeffions of amity, and of a love of
justice, instead of an avowed intent flill fur
ther to impovefifh us, and to pursue a stu
died system of universal domination.
While we lament that some of the inha
bitants of this country have too much at
tached themselves to European politics, we
bclieÂ»e this dangeious miftake.~ proceeded
not from a treacherous defeftion from the
cause of their country, but from the faf
cination of the brilliant fpeftacle of a nation
vjdtorioufly contending for its liberties.â
We reji'ce that the scales have now fallen
from their eyesâthey must now fee, what
enlightened statesmen have seen before, that
the sacred name of liberty is profaned to
disguise projeÂ£l3 of ambition ai d conquest.
Your late communications must cement
the public councilsandencreafetheenergy of
government. The inadmifiible and exorbit
ant exaflions of Fiance, will not only de
prive them of every American advocate, but
convince the world that' an adjustment of
the differences between the two countries,
was impracticable on any other basis than
the prollration of America at the feet of
France. The result in the mind of every
American ir.uft be t manly determi' ation to
vindicate the honour and intercft of his coiin
try.
Should wc be driven to the 2sft appeal,
we have an evtenGve conntry, full of re
fourees, and we t-uft in GOD, v*bo has hi
therto fofiiniallv favored us, that he will a-
O / '
gain inspire us with that glowing zeal and
nndifmayed coinage, which in a period not
remote, the people so fuceefsfully displayed,
and in such an exigency we (hall derive ad
ditional confidence from the firm moderati
on, the lo' g tried integrity, t'nt ripened
wisdom which induced an enlightened nation
to place you at the helm of government.
We cannot close without assuring you of
our entire approbation of your conduit, in
relation to the foreign concerns of this coun
tryâof our prayers for your personal health
and happiuefs, and of our readiness, with
our lives and fortunes, to support the dig
nity and independence of the United States.
Signed by one Thonfand and Twenty-
Seven of the principal Merchants, Free
holders and Inhabitants of the Town of
Providence.
To which the Prejident was p^enfed to return
the following ANSWER :
To the Inhabitants of the town of Providence
in the slate of Rhnde-IJland.
Gentlemen,
This refpedtful Address from the inhab
itants cf Providence, who have been my
friends and neighbors from my youth, was
by no means neceflary to convince me of
their affedtionate attachment.
Imagination can scarcely conceive a
ftionger contrast, than has lately been dis
closed between the views of France and
those of the United States. I will not
distinguish between the views of ihe gov
ernments and those of the' nations 5 if in
France they are different, the nation whose
right it is will soon shew that they fo :
if in America they are the fame, this faÂ£t
also will be (hewn by the nation in a fliort
time in a strong light. I cannot however
fee in this contrast a fufficient cause of dis
quieting apprehensions of hostilities from
that republic : hostilities have already come
thick upon us by surprise, from that quar
terâif others are coming we /hall be bet
ter prepared to meet and repel them.
'When we were the firft to acknowledge
the legitimate origin of the French Repub
lic, we Wifcovered at least as much zeal,
fmcerity and honesty of heart, as we did of
knowledge of the fubjedt, or forefight of
itsconfequencesâtheillfuccefsofthofe proofs
which the United States have given of their
sincere desire to preserve an impartial neu
trality, and of their repeated negociations
for redress of wrongs have demonstrated,
that other means mult be reforte4, to, in or
der to obtain it.
I agree entirely with you in acquitting in
general, those of our citizens, who have
too much attached themselves to European
politics, of any treacherous defeftion, from
the cause of their country : The French
Revolution, was a fpedacle, so novel, and
the cause was so complicated, that I have
ever acknowledged myfelf incompetent to
judge of it, as it concerned the happiness of
France, or operated on that of mankind 5
my countrymen in general, were, I believe
as ill qualified as myfelftodecide; the French
nation alone, had the right and the capa
city, and to them it ihould have been resign
ed ; we ihould have iafpended our judg
ments, and been as neutral and impartial
between the parties in F rafl ce as between
the nations of Europe.
The honor of our nation is now nniver
fally seen to be at flake, and its indepen
dence in question, and all America appears
to declare, with one heart, and one voice,
a manly determination to vindicate both.
Trie legislature, by the late publication
of inftruftions and dispatches, have appeal
ed to the world, and if the iron hand of
power has not locked up the presses of Eu
rope, in such a manner that the fafts can
not be communicated to mankind, the im<
partial sense, and voice of human nature,
mull be in our favor. If perseverance in in
justice should ncceflicate the last appeal,
whatever eaufes we may have to humble our
selves before the supreme tribunal, we have
none, for any other sentiment, than the pride
of vi'tue, and honest indignation against the
late conduit of France towards us. 1 thank
you gentlemen, for your personal civilities
to me, and return your kind wiJhes for my
happiness.
Your noble declaration of your readiness,
with your lives and fortunes, to lupport the
dignity and independence of the United
States, will receive the applause of your
country, and of all others who have the fefi
timents and feelings of men.
