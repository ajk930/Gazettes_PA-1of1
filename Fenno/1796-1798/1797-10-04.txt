7HE TTRANNT OF DEMOCRATS
llss become proverbial evfery where : but
it is in At.xrica that it has dared to break
forth with peculiar virulence and malignity.
Not content with persecuting pAtriolifm,
virtue, aod every species of orthodoxy, in
every shape, it is here that it has, witji the
mod aba.iduncd malevolence, organized it
fÂ»'lf into a regular corps for purposes of
persecution ; and it is here that whoever at
any time can muder up hardihood enough
to walk uprightly, .mud previously fortify
h<mfdf againfi all the moftdefperate assaults
from batteries manned by the united force
of the whole horde of ruffian-looking de
mocrats.
In this course they have but too long,
and it mtid be confeffed, but too fuccefs
fully perfevcred. The time is come when
an united effort of all friends to rational
liberty to cry ft this formidable hydra, is
loudly caft-d for by every tie which allies
the mind of man to poffeflions, without
which life is of no eflimation.
In pursuit of this abominable and mod
abandoned career, every principle of honor
and every tie that ever has been held sacred,
have been facrificed and set at nought.
Distinguished merit, the mod didinguifhed
and mod difintereiled services, indead of
being a proteftion, have served as fignal
marks for tile dircftion of their attacksâ
and in the general chafe, good qualities
taqmfelves have been alike hunted down ,
with their possessors.
But, when a brother has chanced to be
glanced at, in repelling with the weapons
of felf-defence, their malignant and affaflin
like assaults, the whole nest of vipers is
indantly set in motion, and " profccute
liim, break him up, cut him in pieces," is
the general cry. Tyranny, thjr name is
Jacobinism.

Francis I. of France, became the scan
dal of Chridendom, for concluding an alli
ance with Sojyman, the Magnificent, Em
peror of the Tarks. But the butchering
fans-cilllotes who have murdered his de
fendants, can fraternize with the bearded
disciples of Mahomet, without fuffering the
flighted imputation. For, in faft, such is
the reverie of things, the shame and dis
grace now lies wholly on the fide of the
Turk. The Turks are in truth pretty ex
pert murderers ; but their skill is seldom
exercised out of the finall fuch as
lopping off the grand vizier's head on the
loss of a battle, and fo-forth. They have
hitherto fuffered mui lcrâBut if the ruth

" Of the Hi/lory of the conspiracy of Louis
Ph 1 l 1 p pe-Jos e phd'Orlean s, fir named

Tranflatedfor this Gazette.
"If there is* a fpeftacle worthy of being
profoundly meditated, it is that Nvhich em
pires offer at the moment of their fall,â
These great bodies have not,, any more than
individuals the privileges of immortality.â
All here below is fubjeft to changeâto dis
solutionâto death ; the Deity Â»!one is un
changeable.- One nation is born, grows
Up, raises itfelf to a/ great height," then falls
and perishes : this is,the circle, traced by
the finger of the Almighty to societies of
men. Among the multitude of nations who
have by turns covered this globe, there are
foitie, whose names even are swallowed up
by time,
" But it is impofllble to the legislator to
preserve his inductions from the ravages of
time, it out of the power of the maders
of the world, to give to the great family
whose prefervatiqn is confided to them, a
high degree of fortune, to give it even the
duration of the world. There are ( in efFeft
remedies for all difeafiJ of the body-politic ;
it is a regimen which, in cnertrfmg its
drength, in nu'.rrifhiiig'its health, prolongs
its life, and in finding it out, coafills foltly
the art of governing. ,
'â¢ To out th'.i regimen, we mud a
bovtr all examine study her leffous,
enrich ourfclvcSTiy the Apevience.of pad a
ges, draw wisdom from the,errors of gene
rations-which have passed away, and in con
templating those horrid causes which break
the foeial ties, learn to preserve the people
from the convulsions of anarchy. It is in this
refpeft that hidory, according to the -ex
pression of Cicero, if the light of truth and
the rule oflife.
" We are going to read the causes which
have dedroyed a monarchy, which fourteen
ages had fixed on a basis that was thought
immoveable. This phenomenou happened
in a ftort space of time, from a train of e
vents the mod intereding, and which have
succeeded each other with such rabidity that
the eye cannot without, difficulty follow
them Shall the p:3ure of these events be loft
to pnjlerity f Is the hidory of the: late di
faders of France only a vague tS'efiry of
government which every one may cenfiire or
approve ? Are the truths which it presents,
only abftraft political maxims, which the
statesman is forced to ahandon because they
have for foundation the Jiumari puflions,
which vary eternally ? No, it is a generati
on calling around herfelf all generations,
and by a sincere avowal of her errors and
her crime .5, points out to them the path they
. ought to take,not to lose thcrnfelves in the a -
byfs of anarchy. To make this voice heard,
I have 110 need- of giving up myfelf to my
sensesâto abound in reaTonhigs. Prin
ciples discover themselves easily when fafts
speak, and 011 the which I have writ
ten, all red on fadls. The aftors who have
appeared on the Theatre, have pulled off
their rr.afks ; we can read the mod secret
thoughts of their fouls ; we can follow with
, the eye all the windings of their hearts.â
On this Theatre man appears not as he is
painted by writers of by poets and
by philosophers, but as he fliews himfelf na
ked and undi'fguifed, where his weakness is
deprived of the double support of laws, hu
man and divine. What mpre proper to re
cal to his mind what he owes to his fellow
creatures, to his fellow-citizens, to the maf
tet of the nniverfs, than the fiiameful i
mage of this nakedness ? What course of
morality is more edimable than a faithful re
cital, where all the illusions on the true in
tereds of societies, of their chiefs, of their
members, are dissipated, where we may fee
every species of pafiian afloat, aft without
cortdraintâoverturn thedronged barriersâ
break down objefts in appearance insur
mountable.
" You, who read this hidoi-y, in whatever
age heaven has given, or may give you birth,
forget not that he who wrote it, was a wit
ness of the events therein recited ; he was
the contemporary of those men, who, some
through wickedness, others through impru
dence, engendered or precipitated those e
vents ; he lived with some of the workmen
of the dissolution of the fined empire of Eu
rope ; he read their confcienccs as easily as
he did hii own; he knows all the empoisoned
sources from whence flowed so many scour
ges. It was on the wrecÃ of this unhappy
country, in the midd of carnage, of blood
and of deadjsodies, in the noise of the groans
cf innocence, and of the hideous roarings of
executioners, that he sketched these pages.
He is ignorant of the epoch when he may
be permitted to publish them, terror dill
chills our fouls, and the name only of this
liberty of the press, which a lying philoso
pher so long complained againd, only to ap
propriate it to himfelf, frightens anew those
whom it is very necessary to enlighten. The
time when this book wis written, is a fuf
ficieat proof of its authenticity."
, " If the author of this work has escaped
so many dangers, if he has outlived so many
victims, the price of so miraculous a preserva
tion, shall not be a cowardly abandonment
of principles, the return of which in France
can alone indemnify her for her innumerable
losses. He proteds theD, thit in devoting
himfelf to write the hidory of the crimes of
Orleans and his accomplices, he had no other
view, no other ambition,than to convince men
of every age and of every country, that we
ought (as isjudly said by a great politician)
to regard as infamous and detestable those who
diflroy religion, who overturn kingdoms and
republics, who male war again/l virtue againfh
letters, and againjl all those ufeful ads, which
reflet} honor on the human race. These are the
true enemies of mankind ; these are the innova -
tsrs againjl whom, all polijhed societies Jhould
league, and leep themselves incejfantly on their
guard. Without this frmnefs, without this vigi
lance, there is no tranquility for Epipires, there
is na-fecurity for private property

VIENNA, July 26.
On the 24-th instant, about nine in the
morning, the marquis de Gallo arrived here,
and immediately after repaired to Engendorf
where he had a long conference with the
emperor. On his return to this city, he
went to the minyter of ftato, baron Thugut,
with whom he had another long conference.
It was remarkedthat neither the marquisnor
the perfone. about the Court had very plea
sant countenanced. The negociations for
pesce in Italy meet with great difficulties in
their further progress. \
The Freneh requite that Mantua (hall be
united with the Cifilpine republic, though
it was iftipulated in the preliminaries, that
the city (hould be restored to Austria. On
the part of the French, it is said, on the
other hand, that the emperor having given
his confent'to the establishment of a new Re
publia in Italy, its very existence depended
on having Mantua for a frontier fortref*;
the Emper&r, therefore, mult tacitly accede
to the crffion of Mantua, for which he re
ceives a fufficicnt indemnification inlftria and
Dalmatia,
As thele and many other difficulties have
arisen and the House of Austria cannot be
expt&ed eaiily to abandon its great interests
in we are not without our fears that
hostilities may again recommence.
His Imperial majesty intends going about
the end of the mouth to Stein, where he
will review the army of the Hungarian le-
V- -
As there is no danger of hostilities on the
Bohemian frontiers, the emperor has or
dered that the fourteen battalions of rcferve
in that kingdom (hall march immediately for
the army in Italy.
General Mack, who has been sent with
strong reinforcements to the Italian Army,
is already arrived at Gortz,
On the 15th inft. thefirft Dalmatian (hip,,
of 8 gups, failed from Zara, under the
Austrian flag.
MILAN, Jvly 18.
Since the Cisalpine republic has been pro
claimed, the Government at Florence has
taken every precaution against the partizans
of revolutionary principles. The Grand
Duke has raised a body of i2,0r0 men, who
will be sent to the frontfers of the neighbour
hood democratized Provinces; and if is said
that theTufcan towns on the fide ofMode
na and Bologna will be more strongly for
tified.
At Genoa the Doge has renouneed his
former title, and is now only called citizen
president of the Provisional Government.â
The public is no longer styled the republic
of Genoa, but the Ligitrian Republic; Lig
uria being the ancient name of the country.
The archbishop likewise has already intro
duced the appellation of Ugurian'republic
into the liturgy.
July 22.Â»
Buonaparte is still here, and it is fuppo
fÂ«d will not go to Udine, as we had a report
*hat the peace was finally concluded there
on the 14th by general Clarke: but the truth
of this is greatly doubted. (And with rea
son, as the Vienna gazette of the 26th of
July makes no mention afitâNote of Ham
burgh Editor.) v
The province of Romagna was on the
12th united to the Cisalpine republic, on
the motion of citizen Belmonti of Rimigi.
Another conspiracy lias been discovered
at Roine, which was to have been carried
into execution in the night between the Bth
apd the 9th instant. Two of the conspira
tors were promised indemnity on condition
of making discoveries. Many persons have
in consequence been arretted.
The discontents of Naples incresf-. It is
said that the French envoy, Canclaux, will
soon leave that city. His firft Secretary of
Legation, Trouve, is not cordially received
at Court. He is known to have been form
erly editor of the Moniteur.
ITAL T, July 22.
The King of Naples hat ejhiblijhed maga
zines cn the frontiers of the Papal territory
for an army of 50,000 men.
The brother of General Buonaparte is soon
expecicd as French Envoy at Rome. The health
of the pope mends daily.
It is believed that a part of the French Ital
ian army will soon march for France. General
Majfena, it is said, will in a short time go to
Paris. A great part of the troops at Milan
have left that city. The frontier towns of
Piedmont, Tortona, Cuneo and Alexandria,
have been placed by the French on a war ejlab
lilhment.âMantua and Palma Nuava, which
lie on the other fide of the Cisalpine republic, I
have lihevafe been more fortified. At
Brescia, all the artillery has been carried away j
but the Auflrians have not yet entered the town. \
The bank of Venice now pay again as before.
FRANKFORT, July 29.
It is reported here, that the tneps of the
French Savin end Mtufe army on the oiktr
Ifide of the Rhine, have received orders, in con

PAR,*S, August: 12.
Some of our prophets have been mistaken.
The Fete of the icth of August was very !
gay and splendid, and the greatest order
prevailed throughout. The races were ad
mirably managed, and the concourse of peo- i
pie drawn together at the Champ de Mars
was immense.
We have already announced the arrival of
citizen Vifcounti of Milan, as miqfiler ple

that of trance.' In confequente, citizen â 
Sopranzi, who, on the entry of the French !
army into Italy, was sent by the people of :
Lombardy to treat with the Dire&ory rela

Italy appears in the Journal dis Hommes j
Libres. It begins thus :
" We too comrades, have been struck 1
with the truth of the piclure which you have
1 drawn of the present situation of the repub
i ' !C * - . /
" What! (have we cried) so many great
and generous facrifices ! What ! five years
of the most glorious viftories, of the molt j
rapid success, and the most honourable tri- j
umphs, have still left them some hopes of!
giving us a master. Friends !it is but I
too true, and we shudder at it : the govern- '
meht has been vilified. Even within the |
walls of the legislative bedy, the emigrant, '
unpunished rekindles the of civil war, '
and supported by the impostor and rebel- [
lious priest, (hakes around him the torch of
fanaticifm. The defenders of the country,
the old patriots, and founders of the repub- !
lie, are driven from their homes, proscribed,
degraded and maflacred. The generous
friend of his country, who took up arms
for the defence of property, now infirm rind
mutilated, pines in the most frightful indi
gence without the means of existence, with
out pay, and crushed by the insolent luxury
of the unpunished stock-jobber. The pur
chaser of national lands is looked upon as ari
usurper, the sacred principles of liberty and
equality-called robbery ; the philosopher,
and whoever is not a catholic, marked out 1
as impious and an atheist ; the name of citi
zen even become an affront ; in short, from
the North to the South of France every
thing presents a distressing fpe&acle of a de
solated Country."
It concludes thusâ" Our brave brethren
of the north, Italy, the Rhine, Sambre and
Meufe, rely upon us. Comrades ! we have
still strength and blood enough, and more
courage than is necessary, to humble thde
cowardly supporters of tyranny. Should
they dare to take up arms in order to exe
cute their plans Norfhall it be
said that 600,c00 soldiers, the conquerors
of all Europe, joined to their friends and
relations, and forming the purest mass of
the French people, have expressed an ineff
e&ual vow to live free or to die."

" Bayonne, Aug. 5.
" To escape from the Englifli, and get
out of the prison, are two pleaftires I have
iften experienced ; but now I feel them in
a more lively manner, as I am drawing near
my family nnrd friends. In short, four of
us have arrived this day from St. Domingo,
being the deputies of that colony to the le
gislative body. Vergniaud, coufin-german,'
to the great and good Vergniaud, is of the

happy situation, and nevertheless capable of
improvement. I can give you no details on

THE FRENCH REPUBLIC.
EX CUTIVF. DIRECTORY.
Celebration of the Tenth of August.
The following is the speech of Carrot,
President of the Directory :
" Frenchmen,
"On this day, five years ago, the thun
der fell upon the throne. Its splendor was
extinguished, its foundations /battered tmd
annihilated. But a fingL' lustrum has elaps
ed fmce this great epoch ; yet, such has
been'the rapid succession of events, that al
ready we are feparfttcd from it by ages.
M During this short interval, what mem
orable events have crowded after each other !
what triumphs ! what tragic scenes ! what
combinations of sublimity, and of wenknefs !
how many prejudices overthrown ! what
great talents have, been cut off ! what efforts
combined to destroy infant liberty ! how
many billows broken against the national
will ! how many base arts employed to ex
tinguish the republic ! how many vipers
cru flied in her giant arms !
"Woe be to those who fhoul3 conceive
the idea of re-establishing the thrrtne ! What
absurdity to believe tbat those who crushed
it to afhtps, will labour for its re-eftablifii
mentâthat the founders of the republic,
forgetting their glory, and plunging them-,
(elves into the mire, will become the vile in
struments of a liberticidal faction, which
will eonfign them to the collefled rage of
i those vvb.o w;lh. to Jear them ju pieces!
" Where if the man among you, Hi -ten#,
Wiio, it not actively co-operated iti ijie over
throw of monarchy, has not decidedly pro
claimed within his own circle the imprescrip
tible rights of the people ? Where is the
man who can submit-to bargain with kings â¢
who, having vanquished them in the merid
ian of their power, will humble . llimfelf be
fore them when they arj conquered ?
" No > Frenchmen ! you will not forget
what it has colt you to be freeâyou will
not rifle the fame catastrophes, or confcquen
ces still more dreadful, again s tohe-fla.ves.
" Ah ! should the abvfs irito which the
madmen who consider the return of royalty
as an bbje6t offport, endeavour to plunge
you. Have they reflefted tipon the punish
ment which is prepared a* their reward ?
Do they know how much blood would b?
required to quench the thirst of the barbar
ous matters whom they recalâwhat harraff
ing forfeitures would be necessary to fatisfy
their avariceâwhat degree of oppr fÃon
would be Sufficient to render them secure
from the dread of a uew effort of the peo
pleâwhat cares would appear to them-ade
quatc to extinguifn the last sparks of that
philosophy to which they ascribe the firft
impulse of the French to liberty ?
" They would persuade you, that it is ea
sy to substitute the hereditary government
to the conltitutional system ; and they never
speak either of the deadly war which the
just refiftanceof the desperate republicans
would produce in/a thousand quarters, or of
the difficulty of re-cftabhihiftg that inequali
ty of conditions and those feudal inftitutrons
which constitute the bails of monarchy, or
the difficulty of wresting the national prop
erty from the hands of thole who have ac
quired it under the fan&ion of the laws, or
of the fangiiinary conteil which would arise
between the competitors. Who. does not
fee that a whole age would hardly finifh
the single dispute between the Dynaftien
contending for the crown ? Who. does not
fee that a king could be delivered from his
disquietudes when he hid /hed the last drop
of the blood of Frenchmen ? Should you
have filled any employment in the repubKc,
you would be proscribed. Had you flown
to th< 'rentiers to defend it, you would bf
piof-ji V. Did y OU pofTefs any talent,you
wouf ibe proscribed. Should you have pur
chafcd a national estate, you would be pro*
Ccribedâyou and your children. iYeg!
you would allperiih, except thole immersed
in absolute ignorance, who would be referr
ed.to cultivate the foil of their lord, under
the iron rod.'
" To obtain your pardon from the new
tyrant, in vain would you produce the proof
of some base service* secretly performed in
favour of the monarchy, and of your tresrh
ery towards the republic : you would die
with greater ignominy. Yourfperfonal ene
mies would soon difcovf crimes to lay to
your chargeâothers would be eager to de
nounce you in order to save themselves
Such, at every time, and in every country
has been the cruel policy of exiled kings,
who, by means of baseness and hypocrisy,
havefucceeded, themselves or their descend->
ants, in recovering the throne. Can you
hope that you would experience them less
revengeful or more humane ?
" Yes! we swear liy the sacred deposit
which the constitution has for a limited time
entrulted to our care, every attempt to
overthrow the republic shall be in vain ;Â«nd
those who endeavour to accompli(h' this
purpdfe of iniquity, shall meet that death
which they prepared for the republicansi
The chief magistrates of the republic may
differ in opinion as to some of the means
by whicji its liability is to be promoted*
but they will ever be found united in its
defence.
" They will do more, and will exert
themselves daily to love it better. They
know that war is the weapon of despots ;
that ljve and confidence alone are the in
fhuments of. popular governments.
" Agitation will cease, when men cease
to disquiet themselves by the apprehenfioitg
of royaltyâothers by the menaces and
threats of anarchy. Peace will be realized
when the enemies of the republic shall be
convinced, that they will find no point of
support among usâwhen each of us shall
be thoroughly fatisfied that the happiness
of the people consists in the extinction of
all partiesâthat they are desirous to eflab
lifh tranquillityâthat they are tired of be
ing the dupes of the pafiions, and the vain
promises of the faftion;, by whom they
have been alternately misled. The people
compare their situation to what it was twen
ty months ago ; they feel h,ow much it is
improved ; they feel that it will be still far
ther meliorated, when the ideas, which
have been almofl entirely absorbed, which,
to fay no worse, are unreasonable, are at
length exclusively applied to the means of
internal prosperity and political economy.
From this they conclude that the constitu
tion, Wiiich difpenfcs such benefits, is good,
and become wife by their own fuflcrin<rv
they respect the government which they
have chosen : they defpifc, "they hate those
who would lead them to tear their vitals
with their own hands.
" Cease then, Frenchmen, to pursue
Chimeras. Let this day, the
Â«.)f that day on which the republic was
founded, diflipate vain alarms ! Feel, aÂ«
yon behold its splendor, that you ara under
the fame bannersâthat you defend a com
mon enufeâtliat none of vou have auv
mercy to expert from those whole tyranny
you have overthrown. Do not resign youi
felves to difeprd, when you only to
enjoy the fruits of your labours and the
greatness of your defliny.'?

LONDON, Augud 16.
Government received yederday a dispatch
from Paris, announcing the fatt we laid be
fore our readers, of a treaty of peace having
been concluded between the French repub
lic the court of Lisbon ; and early this
morning, Mr. Brooks, the messenger, arrived
with dispatches from lord Malmtfbury, rc
fpedting the fame event, and the effeft it has
had on the date of the negociations at Liflev
No communication is allowed between the
vessel that brought over Mr. Brooks and tlie
people on (hore.
It is impofiible to convey any adequate
idea of the'effrct produced upon the public
mind by. the intelligence of this treaty hav
ing been concluded without the interference
of our cabinet, and in opposition to its views
tion truly humiliating. The funds, of course,
experienced a considerable fall : the three
per cents left off yederday at 50-$, and
opened this morning at and Â£. _
ft is vain to fppk of the ingratitude of
this lad of our allies, as we have spoken of
the ingratitude of all who have previously
Ueferted us. Self-prefervation is the fird
law of nations as well as of individuals, and
this aft of the court of Portugal is a proof
that England is 110 longer capable of giving
prote&ion to her friends. It is a bitter cup
âbut we mud drink it. We h -ve courted
the rod, and we mud submit to the chadife
ment. .
The extrafts winch v.e-haw given trym

P'.irtance. They open a feene of contention,
the result of which it is impossible to antic-i- j
pate. The diredtory has at length giyen its j
anfvrer to the mefTage of the councils ; in |
! which, though it explains with candour the
i fjfpicions circumdances of the event of the
1 march of the troops, it addreiTes the affem
| l>!y in language so figtiificaiit and unequivo
cal on their late proceedings, that it>(lead of
t!it compromise which was expected from
| the prudence, if not from the p itriotifm of
the two lides, it is a provocation to hostility .
on at issue between them. The
debate in the council of live hundred (hews
the imprefilon the answer made on the legis
lature.
What the result of this conflict will be,
we again fay it is not easy to conje&ure.
The direftory, invedetf with all the execu
tive power of the immense territory of the
republicâwith all her armies cordially at
tached to its sway,âwith all the attraÂ£tive
charms of an incessant career of aggrandize- 1
ment, in which a single week is never fuffer
ed to pass without adding some new king- '
dom to the empire, either by conqued or
treaty, or breaking off from the league of '
their enemies some important powerâwith 1
thÂ« recommendation csf having procured
abundance, and restored luxury to Parisâ
with all the force of the country obedient ' '
t6 its command, rnd the multitude indiffer- '
ent to its nftsâand opposed to a legislature
broken into factions in which the very vir- 1
tiles of the good have been furprifcd into an '
alliance with the paflions of the wicked, cer- '
tainly (lands fair for triumph in the contest ; 1
but on the other fide it is to be considered 1
that opinion, transitory in all climates, is pe
culiarly so in France ; and how long the
people and armies (hall continue firm agairid '
thf battery of the press, the {kill, intrigue, j
and force of which were never exerted with
more variety, nor more cunning of attack in '
any age than now in the republic, it is im
possible to fay. At no period of the revo
lution ha 3 the cri.fi* been more interesting, '
nor presented more curiofit) to the accurate
obferver. It (hall be our talk to watch the
progress with the mod vigilant care, and to
(late the occurrences with the mod rigid im- .
partiality.
The (locks yeflerday felt ti depreflion of '
1$ per cent. The quantity of exchequer
bills thrown into the market by the Gold- '
fmids, Antrobus, &c. '.ogcther with the
very unfavorable appearance of the negoci

fall.
Should Lord Malraefbury return unfuc
cefsful from his present million, parliament
will be convened almpjl immediately, for the
purpose of voting twenty-five'millions
ling more, for the continuance of the war. 1
This accounts for the new power of con-
Tening parliament at so short a notice. For- 1
merly the public money was modedly drawn 1
for by ministers at a few days grace ; now
it is done more fweepingly by .bills at fight.

It is not poflible to express the effect t'-at the news
of a peace between the republic aji J Portugal had !
on the public mind. The inability and miferjble j
politics of our pilminiflration, and the very criti
cal Ctuition in which all the continental powers, is
now, we believe, become evident to some of thole
men who have hitherto thought proper to support
the prelent ministers.

Ihould not be surprized at hiring of a renewal of 1
hoitiljtieÂ«.
The I)u'ch, it seems, inlift on a restitution of
their colonies ; and the French government is de
tcrmine4 to support their republican ally.
What the terms of the peace between France
and Portugal are, we do not yet know Our rea
ders will fee, by the official nefTa re ot theDireilo
ry, given in yeftcrday's paper, that the conditions
are not yet announcrd. V\ c cannot however hope
that they ar'c favorah|e to cur intcMds We knÂ»w
that some time ago the confWences were bioken
off, becanfe the renditions demanded by the French
were inordinate, the PortugU'femimller,howe
ver, rftcr eonfulting his court, returned to Pr.iis ;
and though the present circumdances of thing!
may have made the dire&ory abate from some ot
of their pretentions, we fear that the furrendei ot
the Bazils or of Cayenne, may be fuhflantiv* arti
cles of the treaty, or perhaps they may have direc
ted a more immediate blow against the commerce
and revenue cf England, and (hut the ports of Por

Gentlemen,
Though fully sensible of the honor con- j
ferred on me by twice chufing me a mehnber
of the common.council, yet as, if re-eiedted,
my profemonal engagements would not per
mit a proper attention to the -duties of that
station, I request that I may not be voted
for at the ensuing eledtion. I am, with
great refpedt, your fellow-citizen,
WALTER FRANKLIN.
Odtober 2, 1797.
A fire broke out last night in one of the 1
rooms of a house in Court, Wal
nut street. The general alacrity in hasten
ing to the fire, prevented it, after cofffidera- j
ble exertions, from spreading further than
the room where it originated.
To alleviate the anxiety of those absent
citizens, who may be apprehensive from the
deserted state of the city, that there fnigbt j
be a want of assistance in cafe of fire, we take y
pleafureiu mentioning that an ample num- ]
ber of citizens attended on this occafioti, and
that there was no want of buckets.

From the (N. T.) Argus.
Yesterday the Chevalier d'Yrujo returned
to this city from his tour to the eastern Hates.
We are happy to learn that the Chevalier
was received with the utmost refpedt, and
treated with the utmost politeness and hos

1 REMARKS.
What monster to the honor afld interests
of his country wrote the above ? Had the
tale of the cordial reception by the people
of Boston and Portsmouth been true, would
it not haVe been better to conceal than to
proclaim their anti-patriotic infamy? To
give a cordial reception to a man who has
insulted (>ur government, freely eftablithed ,
by ourselves to support our honor and main
tain our interests !âTo look with a friendly
eye on the man who, in my opinion, wiflies
to separate the people from their govern
mentâwitha view (in conjunction with our
now mutual beloved allies) of swallowing up
both government and people !âTo receive
with open arms the representative ol a na- .
tion, who, only three years ago, when it
did not insult, plunder nor threaten us with
nevaftation, our " exclusive patriots," thro'
their patriotic organs, Bache, Greenleaf
and Co. (hewed a furious, tiger-like wish to
destroy with the out-stretched arm of demo
cratic vengeance ! O Greenleaf! how
much longer will you continue to brave pub
lic indignation by daily insulting the most
lacred patriotic feelings of your felloe
creatures? I will not fay, fellow-citizensâ
you have no country except Franceâyou
have atrociously calumniated the charadters
of our patriotic eastern brethren in faying
that the ambaflador of a nation who with
pleasure watches our natioual ruin, was well v
received, among themâThat he was receiv
ed,. I will not denyâbut by whom, I need
not inform those who have been wit- j
nefTes of the worthies who, with bended j
knee, welcomed the arrival of Genet, Mon- j
roe, See. and other " patriots." We all I
know, and in timÂ« of neceflity the foes of
United States will feel, that our enlightened, j
virtuous, and patriotic eastern brethren will j
form an impenetrable phalanx âan impsne- j
trable bulwark to the enemies of the honor
and independence of our country.
, awful crifts which awaits us, let all Jacobins, j
. Anarchills, Gallic Americans amor.g us \
; stand clearâRemember, you have juftified j
r the use of the guillotine towards the internal
, enemies of a foreign countryâbut I hope j
we-will be content to fend off the least in- j
corrigible of you to your foreign allies when
our country is invaded by themâthe
Safety will tell us (ns circumfta'nces mIR
? f i ii'e) what to do with the more hardened
3 and furious. [iV. T. Gaz.

CAUtION.
WHEREAS 3 combination of men irf this
coonty have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
felvcs,by fabricating titles to fundr/ valuable traÂ£s
rff land, the property of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trads of knd large sums of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purihafers â¢
It is therefore just th it public information (hould
be given, to the end, that the injurei) may feck re
dress while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re.
fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several other.' who go under fi&itious names. It is
supposed that the lauds offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have aflual knowledge of are
as follows â¢â¢ Lou No. II and 12, Otfcgo patent,
thousand acres each, the aclual property of William
Dellwyn, bow of London ; lots No. 58 and 64.
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and aines Avenll
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Well* and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.^âThe. Printers will do well to give
this a place in â¢iheir papers, as well totaution the
public against pnrchafing those in* is, as also to de
prive those men in future from hfipnftljg on indivP
duafa, which their education and addrcts have en
abled them to do Iwretofore. Witcomb has been
a (hopkeeper of foinenore in this country.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view the wickkdnel's of those men, which wh<n
the public have percfed, will induce them to ex
culc the interference of "Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 18th, 17 J7.
1 Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witccmb and
â¢Truman Hirrifon, of the farfie County, to sign a
deid to them, for iot No 58, Otfcgo patent, which
was the property of William f. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others; ind further the said Joseph
and Truman did nerfuade me (Â»do this against my
inclination, which was made out tin the xoth day
of November, j1;93, or set back two yeirs fosas
to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
Pardon Starkstothat deed v/as a fictitious name,
there buing no such perlon there. To this t make

On the 19th July, 1797, came personally before

ELlilU PHINNEY, Jufaccof the Peace.
On the iSthJuiy, 1797, came before me Jacob
ICibby, a person !>y me well known and worthy of
good credit, who oa his folcmn oath did fay, that
two of the pji tics ahovementioned did make ap
plioation to him this deponent, some time in the
winter of 1796, to make them a deed for two thou
fahd acres of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a snare of the profits, on the
sale of lands, fcr his so doing ; and that they
made application several tinleS'for the fame e,
which fervicss this deponent as often refufed, de-
them thu he had no right to lands, and
coulddo no such thing ; which daring attempt on

their claims before the cÂ«mniiflioners for carrying in

the United States of America, hereby gives notice that
he has opened his office at his house the south call
corner of Chefnut and fifth ftreett, Philadelphia,
where he is ready to receive all claims or inQruÂ£lions
for claims with the voucheis aud documents thereof,
lor the purpose of bringing forwafd the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prescribe.
Ar>d as it will be for the interest of all concerned,
that the fever*! claims be lo dated, and fuppoit
<d, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
; the neceiTity of obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from perioÂ»a rcfiding at a dillance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (lor the
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the prosecution of
their claims to his charge and management) that all
such c)ain>s ought in particularto set forthâ
ift. The pioper description and fuoation of the
creditor or claimant, end original debtor ( rffpeft
lvely.
ad. The date and nature of the original contrast or
debt.
3d. When, in what manner, and to what extent,
the creditor or claimant wÂ«s prevented or impeded,
by the proviGon, operation or deleft of law, the
drcifionÂ»and of courts, or restraint of exe
cution, from recovering payment ot the debt in
queftiorK
4th The loss and damage incurred or fuflained,
in coniequence of such impediments, whether the
lame may have arisen from the ijtfolvtoey* change of
(ituation, or death of the debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from lapie of time, or othei causes impairing
the value and fetunty of the debt, which would not
havefo operated if such impediments had notexiiied.
And 51b The paitieular grounds and reasons on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the
treaty,, that 44 by the ordinary course of judicial pro
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and aftually
have and receive full and adequate cosnpenlation" lor
the lodes *hd damages so fullaiued.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to sug
gest that the several claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regularly attested, both as to the extftence
of the debts claimed, and such other circum fiances
as may be within their own knowledge respectively.
And wherever the claimants in dating the nature of
their evidence (which must in every instance be the
best of which the ca<e is capable) have occasion to
refer to the tefliraony of witrietTcs, it will be propci
to apprise the gene/al agent of the names and placed

EVFR (ince this disease made such ravages in this
1 city and New-York, the author has turned his
attention to its causes and cure.âThe relult of his
enquiries has convinced him that the rcafon why so
few persons recover from its attacks, are {rem it*
not being well understood, and the confcquent
wrong-method taken to cure it. He is persuaded
that the exceflivc bleedigr.s and mercurial reatment
of the Faculty is highly injurious, and that the on
ly rational mode of treatment is by theufe of proper
acids. Convinced of this he offers his Specific as a
rertain remedy, if used according to the directions.
