Letter to Mr. finc!kney, Minijler Plenipntentiary of
the United Stutej to the b'rench Republic.
[concluded.]
Although the fubjrft of M. De la Croix'3 third
and last complaint (the Britilh treaty) has been al
ready difcufled, allow me here to make a few re
marks. He fays "it will be easy to prove that
" the United States in this treaty have knowingly
" and evidently facrificed their connexions with
" the Republic, and the molt essential and least
" comefted prerogative of neutrality."âThe re
verse of what the mioiller considers fo.eufy to prove,
we think has been demmjlrated. Our legally bind
ing cÂ«nneÂ£lions with France we always considered
as being formed by our treaties: and we fay with
confidence that we have not "knowingly" violated
these in a single article. If individuals have at any
time infringed them, the government has been fin
cefe and diligent in its endeavors tQ redress the
wrong. If the ties of affedion, of warm, enthu
fiailic friendlhip have been weakened, the raufe is
to be fought for not in the aÂ£is of the American
Government 1 ; which have been eonilantly direct
ed to the prefei vation of *ur pcacewith all nations.
These ties did not depend on treaties. It was our
friendfhip to France, contracted during our revo
lution, and oar partiality for the cause of liberty
and felf government for which she engaged in her
own, that made us endure numerous injuries aimed
without complaining. We weie not wilting to as
cribe to the Republic the outrages of her mriif
ters against the laws, the sovereig nty and the dig
nity of the United States, or the exceptionable
stile of their communications. Even when for
such flagrant aggrefllons, often repeated, we defued
the recal of one of her miniders, it was done in 'he
mod soothing language, and in the meantime, led
the intereds of the Republic (hould fnffer, he was
permitted to exeraife his fun&ions in all cases in
which thafe interests could be afFeited. When his
successor arrived, he officially requeded that the
pffending minider might ha apprehended, that he
might be sent to Franc* : But the Government
fitisfied by his removal, declined the measure â
Some irritations were experienced from that fue
criTorâWhit sensations have been produced by
Mr. Adet's notes, your own feelings, on the peru
sal will enable youtojndge. If he intended to ex
cite the general indignation of our citizens, he is
not disappointed": but it is presumed (his was not
the obje&. After an exhibition of complaints in
a stile so exceptionable, he could add but one more
improper aÂ£t, that of publishing his notes in the
news papers : he had'fcarcely transmitted them ta
the Executive, before he iorwarded them to the
printer for publication.
From the foregoing datement we trust it will
appear, That there has been no attempt in the
Government of the United States to violate our
treaty or weaken our engagements with France.
That whatever resistance it has opposed to the mea
lwres of her agents, the maintenance ef the laws
and fovereigaty of the United States and their neu
tral obligations have rendered indispensable : That
it has never acquiesced in any acts vielatilif our
rights or interfering with the advantages Itipulated
to Fracce ; but on the contrary has pppofed theai
by all the means in its pawer: That it .has with
held no fuceours from France that were compati
ble with the duties of neutrality tp grant : That
as well by,their independent political rights as by
the express provilions of the commercial treaty with
France, the United States were at full liberty to
enter into commercial treaties with any other na
tion, and eonfequently with G rcat -Britain : That
no fails manifelting a partiality to that country,
.have been, and I add, that none such, can be pro
duced.
Of the propriety and judnefs of tltefe conclusi
ons you will endeavor to fatisly the French Go
vernment ; and conlcieus of the re&iiude of our
own proceedings, daring the whole eourfe of the
p*efeut war, we cannot but entertain the mod san
guine expectations that they will be fatisfied. We
even hope that this has been already accomplished,
and that you will be saved from the pain of renew
ing a difcufiion which the Government ha 3 entered
upon with regret. Your million and indrutlions
prove its solicitude te have prevented this necessity,
and the fineerity of its present hopes, that your
endeavors, agreeably to those intlruÂ£tions, " To
" remove jealousies and obviate complaints, by
shewing that they are groundlessâto restore
" confidence so unfortunately and injuriaufly ira
" pairedâto explain the relative interests of both
" couutiics, and the real sentiments of your own,"
have been attended with success. And as a confe
[ qtience thereof we rely on the repeal of the de
ciees and orders which expose oui commerce to
: indefinite injuries, which militate with the obliga
â  tions of treaties and cur rights as a neutral nation.
L ' I have the honor to be,
' With great refpeft,
Sir,
Your mod obedient servant,
TIMOTHY PICKERING.

CO MMUNICA TIONS.
/
SIR,
By inserting the following paragraphs yon will
much oblige a subscriber.
A Correspondent asks upon what ground an op
position can be made to fending an envoy extraor
dioary to tfce French natinn ? Will it be said that
there is not an equal propriety at present with re
gard to France, that there was lately in refpefl to
Great-Britain i The cafcs appear to be particular,
ly similarâthe cruizers of both nations have at
tacked our commerce. Why then is an objection
now made, by the very men, who, to a cafe exactly
similar, gave their decided approbation ? Is it be
cause France is in quedion, and wot Great-Bri
tain ?âlf nations are to be treated with refpefl, 1
only in proportion to theirpo-wer, surely"the Frcnch ;
may claim some title to a procedure which would
evidence refpeÂ£t.
At the time Mr. Jay was sent la Great-Britain,
was he Bot made choice of, on account of
tiality to that nation, and as thereby, more likely
to meet with a friendly reception ?âSuch a choice
was exceedingly proper ; it uvinced a peaceful dis
position. But should a different line of conduct be
now pursued, will not the world, with propriety, 1
quellion the " Jincerity" oi our " wishes to pre- |
serve harmony, and a good tlnderdanding with the
French republic."
No opinions are more general, and I am perfua- !
ded none are more ill founded, than that one free
government has nothing to apprehend from another
free government âthat all republics are free govern
ments âthat they naturally love each otherâthat it
is the intered of the United States, that all the
world fh iuld be republicanizedâthat monarchies i
are the natural enemies of Republicsâand that we
ought to embark in the quixotic projects of revolu
tionizing mankind, and giving every nation whether
they desire it or not, a form of government like our
own.
These opinions have not even the countenance
of theory to support them . Are men lei's fond of j
power in a republic than in a monarchy ? Which |
is the mod affurning, a courtier, <y a demagogue ?'
âAll experience hfrs given the lie direst to the 1
opinions above dated j and hidory has furniflied us
1 with examples of their faHity in every page. How
1 pften do we fee a nation refilling tyranny wills one
hand, and at the fame time drenuoufly employing
the other in reducing to the mod abject flavcry
those within their gtafp Those nations who are
â  the moll disposed to establish and maintain their
( own freedom and independence, arc r.ot the lead
disposed to attack the freedom and independence
of o hers. The love of pdwer is as natural and
bewitching at the lave of freedom. I believe mod
( >eopi(; by freroum mean only that <h< y ftxiuld bff
tree thcmieWes.
Will a Virginian pietei:d that he means any
thing more ? Then let him free Uis slaves and give
them a part of what thfir labour has acquiied.
Why (feould a French tepubÃcan love au Ame
ricaii better than a fubjrtt of the French monar
chy ? Is a French man now less immoral, 1,-fs felf.
i(h, less pfoud, less vain, less ambitious, than a
French man twenty ytfars ago ? Will it be laic! that
he loves an American because from him lie firll im
bibed the principles of freedom ? Then it is-they
who owe us every ihinff, and not we them. The
truth it, that all governments are to each other
man in a state of nature isâif not holtile,
yePfelfifh, and disposed 'o promote their own inte
rest and advantageâthey who expett any v thing
else betray their ignorance of human nature.
From the late publication of Monfteur Comma
dure- Brigadier-GeneralÃarney in the Armies of
France, it may be juflly fufpefted that this titled
citizen of Maryland, has a partner in B'altiroorerââ 
a pjrtner in ike profits ef his nefarious trade, -of
capturing the property of his countrymenâHow
long an tinbluihing Catalint will be tolerated by
the men of reflection in Baltimore remains to be
feenâwegtve them the praile of very greatpatienc*
âThe arrival of a Fifty gun (hip in the
Chefapeak mull be a very cxhilerating fpettacle.â.
If Barney can lay out a million'of dollars in his con
tract for supplies it may make some converts.
It iÂ» much to the honor of our country that men
in general condemn the principle upon which 'the
Jacobius juftify Barney's conduct ; You might at
well expeA that an individual Should thrive and fat
ten on the flelhofhis Own limbsâby gnawing his
fliouldersto the boneâns that a nation can even
exill, as Independent, if this disorganizing princi
ple be put inti pra&ice and be juftified by public
opinion.
When the Treaty was talked of the cant of the
French party was what it now is,âThey gave the
Key note of their party here to France, and invit
ed her to join in the concertâThey told France
" don't be afraid to resent this TreatyâThe peo
ple (meaning will join you "-âAW toa
on the President's communication they held the
fame languageâThey invite the French to be irri.
talcdâThey will failâFrance surely mill remem
ber that the tories in the beginning of our Evolu
tion milled G. Britain by similar arrogance ThÂ£y
called themfalves the People, G. Biitain believed
thetn ; France will by this time, surely have learn,
ed this truth, that though the Americans lincerely
wilhed her a good and free government yet they
have not the most dirtant idea of oversetting their
#wn urn i vailed Government to oblige her ! That
the nation are not the whispering malcontents who
tell Mr. Adet a great deal of nonsenseâand that
the People treat with contempt and abhorrence all
hei â¢ empls upon their sovereignty.

ANOTHER FIRE
Broke out Saturday evening in theMalt-RÂ»om of
Mr. Thomas Morris's Brew-house, Moravian al
ley. The hie was extinguished before it got to any
eonfidrrable height, which probably prevented se
rious consequencesâthe place being difficult of
Bccefs, j
On Saturday the remains of Mrs. Brown and
her three children (the eldest a girl of thirteen, the
second a boy of nine, and the yottngeft a girl of
seven years of age) were conveyed in three coffins
from the house of Major Robert Patton, to the
grave-yard of St. Paul's Church, attended by thr
clergy of all drt*ominations, and by the grpateft
concouife of other citizens that probably ever
convened at a funeral in this city. The sympathy I
in this mournful scene, was sincere and nniverf.il, |
and many tears were died {over the deceased, by all
rlaffes of people. After reading the funeral fer
viVe, the Rev. Doctor Magaw ascended the pulpit
of St. Piiil's church, and addressed a fewpathetic
vrords to the audience'. His sympathy, and the
agitation of the audience, prevented his faying
more.âHe concluded by promising to preach a
sermon suited to the awful event next Sunday.
Mrs. Brown will long be remembered and la
mented by all who knew her, for her amiable do.
medic, and fecial virtues.
We have heard since Saturday, that the negro
boy supposed to be burnt, escaped unhurt. Mr.
I Brown is indebted, under Providence, for his life
(to the fidelity and exertions of his black servant,
who conducted him on a ladder from the third dory
of his house, ta which he ascended through a
stair-case, while it was in flames, in order lo save
his wife and children. He was much injured by
the fire, but is now out of danger.
Two servant maids, and three apprentices, who
werclikewife a good deal burnt, and sent to the
Pennsylvania Hospital, are all it is said upon the
recovery.

The fecÃiid resolution was a!fo agreed to.
Mr." Madtfon called up a report of the secretary
of war, on the pet ition of Mr. Poira, secretary and
aid-de-camp of M. La Fayette. The report was
favorable to the petitioner, and Mr. M. moved
that a bill might be brought in. This was ob
jected to ; it was said this petitioner (who alledges
he was beyond sea and could not apply before the
aft of limitation foreclofed his claim) had no bet
ter claim than persons in the country whose claims
had been foreclofed by tht aft without their knÂ»w
ledge. It was committed to a committee of the
whole, and made the order for to morrow.
Mr. S. Smith proposed the following resolution
to the House :
" Resolved, That a committee be appointed to
enquire whether any and what amendments may be
neteffary in the aft to afcertaiti and fix tbe military
establishment of the United States."
A committee of five members was appointed.
Mr. Gallatin proposed the following refolmion
to t4ia House :
" Resolved, That a committee be appointed ts
enquire into the progress made in carrying into
effect the aft providing for the sale of lavds in the
territory nsrth-weft of tbe river Ohio, and above
the raoÂ»th of Kentucky river, and also whether
any, and if any, what alterations are neceflary in

A committee of five wag appointed.
Mr. Heuderfnn called up the report of a feleft
committee on the petition of Nicholas Rufeveldt
and Jacob Mark. The Houf- accordingly went
into a committee of the whole, Mr. Coit in the
chatr. These petitioners pray for the right of en
tering any of the vacant territory of the United
States, to search and explore fÂ«r metals, semi-metals
and all other minerals, and when they find any, to
have an exclulive right thereto for a
allowing the United States an equitable portiou of
the clear proceed*. The report recommended the
priviledges to be granted.
Some obje&ions were made to this report which
was disagreed to. Adjourned.

Friday, Jvnuary 6.
Mr. Harper called up the resolution which he
laid upon the table the other day, calling for cer
tain statements from the treafu'y department, rela
tive to the revenues of the United States.
Ayeed. 4
Alter sundry reports and petitions had been ifted
upon and dilpofed of,
Mr. W. Smith said he wished olay a resolution
on the table, rrfpeftingan alteration in the confii
lution $ it was in that part of it which direftfd the
electors of a president and vice-prelident to vote for
two persons, one of whom dinijld be president and
the other vice.president. It had been d fco'vered,
that great inconveniences might arise from this mode
of election. Gentlemen must be fatisfied that it
could not anfiver the end intended, viz. to carry
into effect tlie real intention of the electors. He
believed there could be no objection, therefore,
to the alteration which he was about to propose,
it went oi\Jy to authorize electors to dcfigiiate
whom they meant to be president, and whom vice
prrfider>t. Mr. Smith thought this a proper time
for bringing forward 'his amendment* fortwo rea
sons, because the matter was frefh in the peoples'
minds, and because it was tight to do it at a period
the mod remote from an election, in order that the
ffates might have time to ratify an amendment be
fore an election might be near at hand ; because,
if pottpOned till near the time of an elcftirn, the
uncertjunty of its being ratified, would have a dis
agreeable effect. He would, for this"pHrpofe, pro
pose a resolution to the following effect :
" Resolved, That the third clause of the fird sec
tion of the fecund article of the confutation of the
United States, ought to be amended in such man
ner, as that the electors of the president and vice
prefident be ditefted to designate whom they vote
tor as president, and for whom as vice-president ;
and that the said amendment be proposed to the
different date legiflaturec for their concurrence, in
order that it may become part of the constitution of
the United States."
It was ordered to be printed. Adjourned.

NEW-YORK, Jimmy 27.
The letter from the Secretary Â»f State to Mr
Pinckney, discloses fomÂ« curious facts. Among
other things, the minider of France has made it
a fubjeft of formal complaint to our government,
that the French flag has not been displayed bet.ore
Congress in their hall of fcflionâand what is more
lingular, the miniller has complained that the pub
lilhers of almanacks and registers have arranged the
names of the Britifti minister, before that of the
French and Spanish miaifters, and he has requeued
the President to disavow this conduct of the prior
ters, and fuppreft the publications.
What will the world think of the agent of a
great nation, descending to such puerilities ? And
what opinion will be formed of the minister of a
free nation, who can be fÂ« ignorant of the laws of
th* United States, a.< to suppose the executive has
the power to fitpprefs a publication, not prohibited
by law ? It' seems as if the agents of the French
nation take unwearied pains to make their govern
ment hated and themselves despised.
The house of representatives have resolved to re
duce t'h>- military edablilhment of the United States',.
by dilbandiug the dragoons. A motion far tedu
ci'njr tfre four regiments of infantry to two, Intro
ducer) by Mr. Willi?.:i)S; did not facceed. 1' fs ch?
culated tha the savings, in the military department,
with a few other items will amount the prefect
year to about 4.00,000 dollars.
By thiHaft arrival* ttom London, we learn thai
the Portuguese minister, commiffi med to treat fur
peace, arrived in Paris oh ihe 7th October.
The Ealt-Jnd a compapy have it in con'empla 1
on to appfy to Parliament for leave ts add to their
capital Itou'k the Turn of two millions. The' rea
lons afljgnrd by the chairman of the court of di
re&ors, are, the high price of war freights ; large
payments to the bank of England and efpeciaily
the valt increase of their trade. The war with
Tippoo had alio created a drawback of two milli
ons f-om what would otherwise have btsn derived
from their territories.
On the ?Bth October, Mr. Pitt b'ought forward
his proposition, in the h&ufe of commons, for
funding the navy and exchequer bills. The former
amounting to 1 1,993,167!. sterling j the latter two
millions and a half. Thefc navy bills fall due at
different periods ; nose were due at tire time of
this proposition, but the ipinilter observed, that
such a quar.tity of floating securities in market in
jured the public credit and the operations of com,
merce. After debate, the motion passed.
During the difeuffion, Mr. I'itt made the follow
ing remarks on the fabjedt of peace and the pend
ing negociation.
!Wor do I consider it as a measure less eligible in
another view of our situation in the profpedl of
peace. It cannot surely be expe&ed that at the
very commencement of a negociation ofcfo momen
tous a nature, and so extensive in its relaiiuns, any
occurrence should take place within the short peri
od of a week decisive of its issue. He mult, in
deed, reason at an extraordinary and unaccounta
ble rate, whj calculates 011 such an eyent. Howe
ver sanguine in ray own yvifhes for the tufptfious re
turn of tranquility, 1 cannot admit that the difcnf
fions of the great and important intereftsof Great-
Britain and her alljes, and of those weighty and
complicated points which they neceflarily involve,
are likely to be so speedily decided ot brought with
in so short a compass as to have any influence on
the prcfeiit measure. There is, indeed, ont possi
ble cafe, which 1 reluctantly notice, arid which I
sincerely tiuft will, in the present instance, be avert
ed, which might render the rcfult of negociation
matter of such speedy issue, namely, that some oc
currence (hould take place, or some proposition be
ftartcd in its very outset, of such a nature se at
once to put a negative bw all our hopes of peace,
and to put a (lop to all farther proceedings. But
if we (hall be ultimately fuccefsful iÂ« the gtand ob
jftt of all onr v.'ifties, jt is not the.space of a "Tingle
week which can give any definitive turn to the com
plexion of negociation, fat less decide the impor
tant issue. But-if from the magnitude and impor
tance of the questions to be difctiffed, it (hould be
necefTary to adopt a plan of negociation more ex
tensive, and likely to be p atradted for a considera
ble period, it is reasonable that during all the time
we lUoul.l submit to the pressure of an evil, which
so long exilts, muff continue to weigh down our
prolperity, and which wc possess the means inflant
ly torcÂ»iovf, if \ye have only the energy to exert
it !"
BOSTON, januaiy 2 1.
From the Weft-Indies,
By the schooner Raven, Capt. Ambrose Martin,
which arrived at Marblehead on Monday evening last,
in 38 days from St. F.uftatia, we have the following
ifite Iâ  uccâOn the 4th of December, tjire* (hips of
â¢he line and oik frigate, under Britifli colours, came
down Matia Road, and commenced an attack up.on
the town, and the Medee French frigate and a (loop
of war. and after firing two hours (in which time
they were well aofwered from th(t tort and the two
French (hips) they returned, without doing the least
damage to the town or the F'rei>ch (hips, excepting
lodging about 60 shot in the empty stores. But in
their progress, they committed , n action, which will
Hand recorded an eternal difgracf in their naval history
âCapt. Benjamin pi/imond, in a (loop belonging to
Salem, that very morning .carried in by a French pri
vateer, being bound to Antigua from Charleston, then
lying in the Road, was wantonly run down bv one of"
the Britifli (hips of war f and his Mate, one lailoc, and
a black and a white bey were drowned, and the vsffel
an<j cargo entirely loft. Another (hip endeavoured to run
down Capt. Martin's schooner. The Mate only was
on board ({he crew having all died) and perceiving
their indention, endeavoured to cut the cable, but not
being aliV- to effect this, he loosened it, and the schoon
er fell off, the (hip jjift pafljng her. One of the crew,
as file passed, threw a billet of wood at the Mate, from
the forecaftle âand an Officer, looking over the quar
ter, ordered the " Damn Yankee Rascal to hawl
down his colours" âwhich was immediately complied
vdth. But not content with this, veering his (hip,
he fired ? broad fide into the fchooner âand there
wÂ«re J9 fliet in her main-fail, 4 (hot in the main-mast,
two of which remain there, and a I4lb. (hot-puffed
thro* the schooner's quirter, and lodged in the lower
hold in a barrel of fweÂ«t oHâ^-which (hot Capt. Martin
has prefecved and brought heme, as a lifting memorial
of the Amity of Great Britain to this Country. N.B.
âCapt, Martin's schooner is exa&ly " seventy tons"
burthen.
Capt, Diamond, finding his vessel loft, endeav
oured at the hazard of his life, to preserve his
ctewâhe hired two Negroes and a boat to go off
and take up his menâhut the Negroes finding the
(hot flew so thick, refufed to go off, and neither
threats or perflation couldÂ»make them go. Capt.
Diamond then went on board a Danish brig, where
t.e was molt -brutally treated, and threatened to be
thrown overboard. While on board the Danish
brig, Captain B>. saw one of his men at mad head,
waving his handkerchief tor aflilianceâbut alas 1
he could not reliete him, and he with three of his
companions, periftted, victims to Bntifh infslence
and wickedness.
Capt- D. has entered his proteii against this un
warrantable proceeding.
Capt. Martia Supplied Capt. Diamond (who
has thus by the ruffian hand of violence been depriv
ed of his all) with money, and offered him a pas
sage in his vesselâas did Capt. Story, of Marble
head, with whom he took passage for Philadelphia.
He was also supplied with cloatbing, board, See.'
by a gentleman of St. Euftatia. Previously he had
applied to the American Consul, who refufed to
give hits auy aUiitance whatever
On the 29th Nov. the French attacked the If!-
â¢>u<f of Afguilla, Â«?>d took h "â¢ A er ' tiii'i-ig they
fvund 15 F'e ;ch prifonera r.ecerirly butchered-
which f<Â» txafpcrated the Fie. -b CusiMWift, that
he gave orders to spare no one, anJ gave the town
up to'plundcrâwhich ordcis wee punctually exe
cu ed | and thi>fc inhabitant who could i.ot ef.-ape
irtt 'lie country, all perished. After this unfortu
na aft of retaliation, and the whole town wascen
iusied, :he French returned to St. Martin's.
While' Captain Martin was at 'Statia,'
bottomed Brj ifb (hip, leaded with claved
and coffee, from Martinique bound to L ;don,
with twelve 6 plunders and 20 men, was,captured
and brought in by a small French privateer fcfioou.
er, with eight 4 plunders, and 50 men. 81.e fold
for 7500 joes at auÂ£tion.
Capt, MacCartney, in a schooner belonging to
BoHph, from London to Demcrara, was captured
by a Briti sh Frigate, and ordered for Matinique,
with a prize-master and 8 seamen, Git their pas
sage thither, Capt. McCartney, with the fuper-gar-t
go, and his son, fjcuiid the Englishmen below and
hie veffcl. A (hort time after, being at
: helm, with loaded piltols in the wailtband of hit
small clothes, he received a blow from the tiller, and
Â«ne of his piilols went off, and wounded him in the
thigh'morully. He then gave up the veflel again,
and released the Englishmen. She was carried imp

DELAWARE STATE LEGISLATURE.
IN SENATE.
FROM THIJ JOURNAL.]
Wednesday, January 18.
The following refutation was laid on the table
for the cenfideratiou of the Senate:
Whereas all governmeuts ooght to he formed for
the good of the citizens who compotjhUhe fame,
and the right of making, altering,
any particular form of government, is inherent is
the people ; and it is declared hy the eonftitufioti
of the United States, that a stile may be formed by
the junction of two or moie states, or parts of
dates, with the consent Â»f the legislatures of the
ltates concerned; ss well as of Congrcis. And
whereas many of the good citizens of this (late
apprehend that its territory is toe small, and the
resources thereof inadequate to the talk of fupport
iÂ»g a frame of government calculated to promota
the happiness and feiÂ«re the and liberties of
the good people thereof, without impoling on them
a burden exceeding their ability ; and ii is the
opinion of this legislature, that their conltituentt
(hould be confultcd on a fubjeft so important (9
their general welfare.
Therefore Resolved,
By the Senate and Houfc of Reprefentativees of
the (late of Delaware, That the citizens in the
several counties throughout this (late are hereby
recommended at the general election *f representa
tives on the firll Tuesday of Oftobcr next, to deÂ»
clare their opinions of the present form of govern
ment of this ttate, by voting also by ballot for or
agaiuft a t'iffoltition of the fame, as they (hall
severally choose to do j and if (halj
appeal that a majority of all the citizen's voting fur
representatives, have voted in favor of a dissolution
of th. â¢ efent form of government âthen the next
legislature of this Hate (hall take such measures a*
to their wisdom (hall seem proper for obtaining the
consent of the legislatures' of Maryland and Vir
giuia, and ot Congress, for uniting their territories
on the east. fide of the Chesapeake bay, with ths
territories of this (late, so that the whole peninsula
may form one entire (late, under such frame of
government and name, as (hall be agreed upon by
the representatives of all the territories in general
convention met ; or the consent of the legislature of
Pennsylvania, or of Maryland, and of Congress, soy
uniting this (late with Pennsylvania, or Maryland,
in such manner as (hall seem moll proper, and belt
calculated to promote the only end of all legitimate
governmentâthe rights, liberties, and happiness of
the people.
Saturday, January 21.
Having resumed the consideration of the fore
going resolution, and on the question to adopt the
fame, it was carried in the affirmative with only
one dissenting vote, and sent to the House of Re.

Porcupine's Gazette.
Propolkls by WILLIAM CObBETT, oppolite Christ
Church, Philadelphia, for publi(hing a news-paper,
' v to be entitled
Porcupine's Gazette, $S* Daily Advertiser.
Methinks 1 hearthe reader exclaim ; " have
we not Gazettes enough already ?" Yes, and far tÂ»o
many: but those that we have, are, in general, con
duiled in such manner tlrat their great number, in
llead of rendering mine unnecessary, is the only cause
that for its eftabliihmcnt.
The gazettes in this country have done it more real in
jury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They
mislead tlie people at home and misrepresent them a
broad. It was these vehicles of sedition and discord
that entouraged the counties in the Well to rebel ; it
was they that gave rife to the depredations of Britain,
by exciting the people to such ails of violence against
t:iat nation, as left no room to ctoiibt that we were de
termined on war ; ami it was they, when an accom
modation had been happily effeiled, that llirred up an
opposition to it such as has seldom been witneiTed, and
whieh was overcome by mere chance. These gazettes
it was, that, by mifrcprefenting the dispositions of the
people, encoifraged the French to proceed from one
degree of infelenceto another, 'till at last their Minis
ter braves the President ill his chair, aad a bullying
commander comes and tells us that his only bufinefi is
to feizc our vellels, in violation of a treaty, in virtue
of which alone he claims a right to enter our potts : and
it is these gazettes that now have the impudence to de
fend what their falfehood and malice have produced.
1 ihall be told that the peopl* are to blame ; that
they are not obliged to read these abominable publica
tions. But they do read them; and thoulands who
read them, read nothing else. To fupprels them is Im
possible ; they will vomit forth their poison ; it is a pri
vil*ge ef their natures, that no law <ian abridge ; and
therefore the only mode left is, to counterail its effeils.
This must be done, too, in theirown way. Books,
or periodical publications in the form of books, may
be of some ferviee, but are by no means a match for
their flying folios. K f&lfebeod that remains uncontra
dicted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth,
and when the detection at last makes its appearance, it
is often as useless as that of the doitor who finds his
patient expired. The only method of opposition, then,
is to meet them on their own ground ; to set foot to
foot ; dispute every inch and every hail's breadth ;
fight them at their own weapons, and return them two
blows for one*
A gazette of this ftarap is what I have long wilhed to
fee, but I have wilhed and expeilfd it in vain. Indig
nation at the fupinenefs of otheis has at last got the
better of all diffidence in my own capacity, and has de
termined me to encounter the talk. People have heard
one fide long enough ; they (hall now hear the other.

AN ENQUIRY
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on Morals and Happirtefs,
By William Godwin.
THE reputation of this work is already well esta
blished in Europeâlt is hardly necelfary for an Ame
rican editor to fay more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning Politieal Juiiice has evet
fince its publication been a favorite performance with
the friends of republican government. The ffile it
pure, nervous, and classical; the ideas are
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, amonglt
a multitude of dther just and striking pafiages, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities inlepa
ra'oie from the condition of a King, may be pointed
o>lt as a most mafteriy fpeeimen of philosophical d.f
quilition. Ihe latest London edrtion of this work
i'ells in this city at four dollars and an half.
