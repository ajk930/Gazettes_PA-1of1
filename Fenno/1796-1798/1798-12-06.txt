ft. THE Con-refs of tlie United States have
the again convened. It is to be hoped that thc j
ati- prelent session, like the I*ll, will be marked I
with ttrong and detifive measures. The at- j
fur- tent ' ou Europe is direcled, in rvo fnn'.l de- ;
gree, to the condtuft of this country. Ame- i
:lre rica has acquired great reputation from the
ter, noble firmnefs of her President, and the en
Â»"> thufiallic ardor of her youth. The wife and
h'y vigorous laws which were enacted during the
du- I' a ft T lon Congress have contributed,
" I likewise, to give importance to her name. I
igh I trtift tbe national will be aaxious
re . Ito encre'afc the influence and respectability
ant I their country. 11 this difpolition fincere
"yac'tuates them, they will f'peak the language
il ': of can dor and truth ; they will treat with
rd- ~ PC and indignation those Ihanx-lefs 1
I protelfions of moderation with which the 1
;in- I " lfamo " s tyrants of France are endeavoring 1
to amuse and deceive. In our Chief Magif- 1
I cj ate WC " fafe, 7 re P unbounded con

he speaks of the wrongs of hiscountiv, and 1
es. j tne zeal with which he urged the vindication i 1
of her honor, mark a firmnefs of spirit from | 1
which every thing is to be expetted in the I Â£
hour of danger. The French dire Aors know e
that the Chief Magistrate of America can "
neither be intimidated by threats, ncr cor- 3
_ I rupted by intrigue. He perfeftly understands 1
their policyâHe knows that they can be c
j haughty ; and that they can be mean. Ame- ,Â°

! to this fiUiation would your country have
b-'en reduced, had thef'e men fncceeded in
their \iews. But, umler die hleliings of
heaven, their schemes were bailicd, and a wife
and noble policy was puiTued.âOur trade is
protected.âThe American flag floats in tri
un")h on the ocean, and nÂ«:a French robber
dare Ihew himfelf on our toast. Walhington
has left his retirement, and has taken the
command of the armies 01 his country. The
feelings of patriotifni have been kindled, and
that mercenary spirit has vanifliid which
would hallance the expences of war against
national di (honor. The conduct of our
government has produced, likewise, the most
happy effjfts in Europe. It is a noble ex
ample to thole countries which have submit
ted to ini'ufts and injuries. It has taught
t!iem that force is the only weapon by which
they can prefcrve their honor, and that fafe
ty is to be acquired only by speaking and
acting boldly. Legillators of America !
persevere in this wile and magnanimous cburfe
of policy. Forfeit not the reputation which
your country has acquired. I do not ad
dress niyfelf to theTeaders of the faction.â
It would be in va-in to talk to men whole

ings of patnotilin. They will continue to 1
b_* faithful to their matters. If anv firm mea
sures are propoled they will declaim (in the 1
pacific difpolition which France has lately 1
exhibited, and conjure the House not to blast '
the fair profjx-Cl that is'begianing to opeU on :
the country. Yes, fellow-citizens, the Ge- '
nevefe and his followers will be impudent (
enough to attribute the late measures of the 1 (
dire&ory to lincere and virtuous motives. I
Do you think this impolfible ? I refer yon '
to a speech which he delivered'in the House <
of Representatives after the dispatches had 1
been jiubiirhed. He reprefenttfd it as highly ' c
iffiproper to make EiTMvh uie UMUlHuiUcaLnum â  *
from our comn>iflloners. He declared that 1
the Senate, in puWiJhing them, had taJcena <
step which would inevitable involve the ' <
country in a war. He fa id he entertained | 1
hopes that our difference- wouM yet be ad- <
jutted, but that the Senate, by that rash mea- 1

Ike f;)lrnd:d victory g lined over tlie
French fleet, Winy yety probably produce thr
moil important co-ifequencej of any one
event imc.e the cainmencement of the pre
fect war. Whether we ennnedt this event
with the present lla'e of independent na
tions. or with the ilate of those unfortunate
people who a e now groaning under the _
, power of France, or with the (late of the '
interior of France itfelf, it ii calculated to
produce very important efFcdts.
With regard to the interior^of France, it
it '.B more than probable it will hasten a
change that is evidently approicliing. Vain
and fond of military glrry, the French at
[ all times have piifiied fucccfs too far, and
when xe the current has fairly set in a- a
gain (I them, they have loft all that -nergetic m
. enthuiiafm, which swelled the success it had v '
( occalio ed Louis the Fourteenth was the 01
_ terror of Europe ; a-d the glory he a quited S'
r by the brilliancy of his victories render d nl
. â  hini absolute master of the lives and fortunes
_j ot his subjects ; hut no sooner was that 111 (I re A''
i tarnirtieil by a reveife of fortune, than all â¢
enthnfiafm. and energy, abandoned the n
_ i French nation ; and the man whom till then
_ 1 they adored as a conqueror and almolt as r '
, ijrod, th y began to detest as an extrava
i gant prodigal, whiÂ» had waited their blooJ S'
and trcafure to gratify vani'y a:d whim. a '
I he latter years of the Grande Moriarque
j | were as much imbitterec! by the negled- ;l1
s ; bordering on disgust, that he experienced b '
from his fubj' Â£ts, as his prosperity had been e
s incieafed by their praise and adnlaiion. 11
The 'fForts of France fmce the revolution (
. have ail, except the expedition t~ Egypt,
had some pretext besides ihat of ambition '
(though, indeed, frequently a very bad one) r<
| but the invaflon of Egypt was merely the Â°.
j efforts of ambition run mad. Alexander or 1
t.harles XII never attempted a wilder ex- 1
i periment ; and Don Quixotte who was a
private madman, on his own account, ne~ *i
r ver embarked mor j uselessly in any projedt. \
3 The pomp and parade of learned men, |/
and ihe great expeiice attending the expe-
U dition, (hew that it was intended.to prolong
national enthusiasm, and gratify French va
s nity ; for even the diredtory could not as- t
lign any better motive than avenging a few
French merchants, and subduing rebellious
~ Beys, with whose allegiance they had no
g ( kind of connexion, and from the sovereign ()
j | of whom they could expedt no thanks, !â¢
j We may fairly cÂ«nfider this difaiter a sthe j
j shipwreck of French vanity , and therefore 0
e the exertions, the unanimity, the tamenefs e
n of the nation, are probably at an end. An ..
j explosion in the interior may probably take
j place ; but even if it should not, the diredt- a
t [ ory will no longer be able to delude the .lati j
( j !on ; and in future, whatever they may have t
| experienced, they may expeft from an op- ,
e pressed peopleâenrfes d ep mouth'd. j
In the interior such will na r urally'be the
effedt ; and we hope that France, now that t
, the dream of gl irv is at an end, will no lon- i
er be supportable to herielf, or formidable 1
to her neighbours. \
AgainâAs to the conquered people of
Holland, Switzerland, Italy, aad Flanders, j
they will feel the yoke doubly galling and
Jj- the burthen heavier than ever.; and while
their fufFrance is augmented, the fears iti- I
. spired by the invincible armies of the Great
Nation will cease, when they contemplate
j the felly and hiiiiulity of their matters !
l e Part al rev It. wi 1 then pr bably change to
general infurredtion, and France will then
r be reduced to its former limits again.
As to the independant nations, they will
â  eeafe to regard with terror, madmen who
have only hitherto owed their success to the
daring boldness with which thty have advan.
' ccd, and their want of regard to every kind
j a of principle, for to such, we maintain, the
j Great Natiou its success.
A general league will more easily be form
-8 ed, not for attack, but for defence, aganft
ie the.most unprincipled men that ever haiaf
ie fed the peace of nations ; and, therefore, we
may have some hopes of peace, impractica
ble with that ambitious nation, so long as
those others, who ought to have joined iil
j dempnding tt. have been retrained form fear
and apprehenfinn of danger.
aS Such.are the political efferSts naturally re-
fulting from a charge of opinion, founded
on a change of circumftar-ces ; but the cer
? tain efFefts are to this nation faf.ty ; the to
tal ruin of the n<Vw diinim'fhed French navy,
and the impossibility o' attackii.g our pof
fcflions in I 'dia, of revulutionixing Turkey,
""r ' or of making war, oh .Naples, and taking
'-will now be again free, and Malta will not
' long remain fn pofTeffi in-of its pref 'it ma
! Iters ; for >he superiority gained by sea is
j n | ready so great, that France has no alterna
o{-! tive but to keep its Slips at borne, or to be
t | beaten in every engagement.

1 Ihnll be necelFary and ifor carrying in- E
to execution the foregoing powers and all H
other powers vafted by this conftitu-tion in pi
the government of the United States or in H
any department of office thereof." Hence to
we find full power given to congress to make
all laws from time to time which tnav be
deemed expedient and nece.iTary for the iafe
ty, peace and happiness of the community at
largeâ Tuat the power of providing for the "
common defence and general welfare of the c '
country is expressly prohibited and taken 0
from each state refpeaively by the 10th sec
tion of article ift, where it is enaded " that \
110 state ilia! 1 enter into afiy treaty, alliance,
or confederationj grant letters of marque t!
and reprifaf, &c. and further prohibits (with
out the cbn'fent of congress) each state from r
keeping troops or fliips of war, or entering *
into any agreement or compact with any "
other state or with a foreign power, or to "
engage in war, fee."âwhich indisputably f<
prevents each state from arrogating to itfelf 11
a power to provide for its common defence 1
and general welfare this power then is ex
pressly given where it ought to be, namely,
to the congress of the United States, the
â  representatives, guardians and servants of the (
people.
That tq obviate all' doubt and misconstruc
tion of anyparticular clause, the true mean
ing and intention of forming the eonftitu
â  tion may be seen from its preamble, which
is thus written : Â« We the people of the
f United States, in order to forma more per- 1
, feÂ£t union, establish justice, insure domestic Â»
I tranquility, provide for the common defence -
f promote the general welfare and fecywe the 1
- â  blessing's of liberty to ourselves and ourpof- 1
t terity, do ordain and eftablilh this conftitu- p
e tjon for the United States of America." 1
- Here we hnva the very spirit of our confti- I:
0 tutioiifuliyand unequivocally exprefied, pre- ]
n vious to the insertion of each particular clause '
further comment thereou is therefore altoge r j 1
II ther linheceflary. That provision has con- 1

(. oeciient to be suspended, that the lcgillature
may adopt whatever m?afures Its wisdom may
udge expedient for the preservation of, the
[â¢_ people and countryâ'Fhat therefore, whene
r /er the public flfetv require it, the people, by
â heir representatives in Congress, may enait
iufy law which mav be judged expedient for

pealed. â  That opposition and refift'ance to
subordination and good order, refpeft for
the constituted authorities, and e'tablifhed

and ought to be diminished. That therefore
all the good citizens of the United States of

tÂ£rs, be held in requisition to repel and re
train this hydra of many heads, and which'
too like Proteus can appear in as many shapes.
as it requires indeed an Herculean arm, to
â¢lemolifli and eradicate its baneful effect:â
That taking the embargo off American vef
