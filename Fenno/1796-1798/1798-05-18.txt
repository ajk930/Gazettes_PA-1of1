HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, May 7. .
MR. THATCHER a memori
al from Buxton, in the state of Malfa
chuletti, lamenting the dangers which threa
ten the cuiuntry from the arming of merchants
veliels, deprecating a war with any Nation,
particularly againlt a Nation who formerly'
contributed her affiltaiwe to preiierve thft
tountry from ruin, and praying that means
)nay be used to restore that confidence and
friendlhip which has beea so. unhappily im
paired betwixt this cottntry and the trench
Republic.
Mr. Va&sCM prefenteda memorial to the
iameeffect, from Falmouth, Maflachufetts.
Mr. New laid before the house some reso
lutions entered into by the freeholders ot
Middlesex county, to the fame purpole.
Mr. U\ vis laid the following,refolutien
upon the Ã¼ble :
41 Rfilved, that the numltfr of troops in thefrwice oftbe
Unit.J States on tl}i Afi;itury Ejtablijbmenty be so in

amount to tOfiOO â¢fillers, itvn-eommijjioned officers and
privates tncl-Jive."
Mi. Macon from the committee of revifal
and unfiiulhed business, made a report on the
petition of Wm, Simmons, Accountant of the
V/ar Department, which was committed.
Mr. Pincknev said, he rose to request
leave 10 withdraw the lefolution which had
yefteruay been laid upon the table by his col
league (Mr. his knowledge,
relpecting a bulinets which had already been
decided relative to huuielf, as it was founded
upon a ground which was at least doubtful,
and he thought 6ot of order.
The Speaker â fmtrmpTca Wi.K to fay
that he tfould lave himfelt' the twuW( Us
any farther observations, by faying that he
deemed the lnoiiou out ef order.
Mr. PINCKNfiY hoped, notwithstanding,
he should be permitted to make a few remarks
011 the fubjedt.
The Speaker replied, that any remarks
npon a buliuefs already decided would not be
in order, and could not be admitted without
general content. A pretty general cry of
1 hope the tientleman -will be permuted to proceed,
being'heard, Mr. Pinckney went on.
He said, it was with reluctance he took up
the time of the house a moment in a matter re
lating to himfelf, particularly at present, when
so much important business prelfed for consi
deration ; but he wished to state his reasons
for wishing this motion to be withdrawn, left
it should teem to have been brought forward
by his cbnfent. He was grateful tor the good
intentions of his colleague, because he doubt
less thought the vote which had pafled on the
preceding day might cast some imputation
upon his (Mr. Ps) character But he also
withed it to be wtt%irawn, because it was
founded on at lealt a doubtful l'uggeltion, viz.
that it is not customary foe the United States
to make presents to Foreign Muiitteia leaving
this country. He believed it was customary to
do so. But another reason for wishing it to be
withdeawn was, that the difcuflion of it might
not subject him to a species of trial as to his
public conduct, in which he should not beat
liberty to make his defence. He would never
lhrink from any authorised invefligation ot his
conduct ; but he should wifli to avoid any
unauthorifsd proceeding of that kind.
But his principal reason for troubling the
house was to allignhis reasons for addreflinga
letter to Congress on this fubjeit, apparently
offo trifling anature.With respeCt to the pre
lent offered to him by the Court of Spain, it
would I*ve been impropet for him, under any
construction ot the conllitution, to have re
ceived it, as lie was at that time also M nifter
to Great Britain. Upon this ground it was
tharfie wrote to the bpanifh Mimfter declin
ing the acceptance of the prefisnt offered to
him from that Court, except he should ob
tain leave of Congress to do so. 1 his being
the cafe, whatever might have been the pro.
priety of accepting ol the present offered to
him by the Court of Great Britain, there
would have been at least an appearance of in
consistency to have teceived a present from
one Court, and not from the other. He there
fore gave the iaine anfw ertoboth.
This he hoped would account falisfadtorily
for havwig troubled Congress with any appli
cation on tins subject. It was from a respect
which he tiioiight due to the court ot Spain,
from the favourable treatment lie had receiv
ed from them, anil being fully fatisfied with
all their conduct towards him, that he thought
it proper ta make the application. The other
refpectmgGreat-Britain was involved with it.
Mr. P. laid he did apprehend there would
have T>een a propriety in house, at
the time they rejected the fent
from the Senate, to have ailigned a reason
why tliev did so. He would fay why he
thought 10. He thought the Conflitution ex
pressly allows, that, in some cases, presents
may b; received from a Foreign Power, but
that the power of deciding upon this (hall be
left in,the hands ot the legislature, as a check
upon officers that they may not improperly
receive any prefent,from a Foreign Power.
But considering this power to have been in
tended asa check upon the improper conduct
of officers, it must strike the minds of the
public when they are told that an officer was
se r ufed this privilege, that he had not d>>:ie
his duty (especially if the refufal was unqua
lified, and unaccompanied witliany reason for
the refttlal) and that the refufal was intended
as a censure upon his coiidurt.
It was in this point of view, that he con
ceived tiiÂ« conduct of the person to whom
this privilege was refufed, was implicated,
without an opportunity of being heard in his
defence. He lhould be far from wishing any
resolution to be enteftd into approving of his
conduit ; but there was a great diltindion
betwixt approving and disapprovingâbetwixt
censure and applause ; and although he did.
notdefire applause, he could have wilhed to
have avnidedcenfore. All that he wished had
been doe was, tnat th* haufe should have
dated something of this kind, " deeming it
improper that t.ie Diplomatic Agents of the
United Sta'ei should receive a present from
any Foreign Prince or State, the request can
not be complied with a*, without this, th;
natural inference must be, th.it there has been
fjme mifhehaviour in the officer, or the ufuai
privilege would not have been refufinl. He
called it tifual, because wherever it had here
tofore been applied for, it had been iuvjria-

bly granted, and the rejection of the resolu
tion from the Senate, must, therefore, be <
looked upon as eftablifhingan imputation up- t
onJiiÂ»chara6ter. It was laying to tlio world, i
" Every other person in afimilar filiation, I
has been permitted to accept us these prefents,'t
but you, and you alone, are an exception you i
cannot receive them." Such a perflni may I
have been worthy of cofldenwaMon ; J* may i
have bstrayed the ititerefts of hi* coSfttry ; i
but it was inju(iice to that per&n to condemn i
him without a trial. <
Mr. P. laid, he thought it aeceffary,' in jus- '
tice to himfelf, to make tilth; obfervafions I
before the houfo, from* regard which he felt
in common with other'gentlemen, for his re- <
putationâmore particularly at tikis matter
would appear upon the J ournajs of the house, i
and might not only reftefct upon himfelf, but :
upon his children atter him ; they might be
pointed at by the Finger of Scorn, as the off
fpringof a matt who had betrayed theinterelts
of his country. It was under the impreflion
of these ideas that he had been led to trouble
the house, and he trusted he should stand ex
cused for having done so.
Mr. M'Dowell rose, but was prevented
from speaking by the Speaker, who declared
1 that nothing more rottkl be admitted on a sub
' jeet which was not before the house.
: Mr. Harper rose. HÂ» was also checked
1 by the Speaker, but not before he had de
clared he brought forward the motion in guef
tion without the knowledge of his colleague.
Mr. W. C. ClahSornk called up the re
lolution which he yesterday laid upon the ta,- '
ble, relative to the irregularity of the poll iii :
the Western country, which was agreed to.
The house then proceeded to the order of
the day, when the Speaker having ItatM
1 the question to be to. strike out the word an
nually in the firft resolution,
Mr. Dwioht Foster rose and observed,
' that for a juftification of hitnfelf to thole who
knew him, he need not decTate tliat the Â»>K>-
. tion which had caused so "ij
ma 3? wuti 11 nor
designed to einbarrafs th*metffiirtf*bÂ£govern
ment, or with a view to prevent * provision
of revenues adequate to the prefent-w proba
' ble future exigenciesâor fromany reluctance
on his part to concur in every measure requi
' site for an effeitual defence ofour country. â
To the uniform tenor of his conduit, on all
occasions, since he had the honor of a feat in
1 this house he wouldchearfully appeal. Those
' with whom he aflbciated knew, that nothing
was more clear to his heart than the honor,
1 the dignity, the liberty and independence of
his country. He. did not, therefore, confi
-1 der many of the remarks which had been
made on this fubje6t as applicable to himfelf,
' nor should he take any measures whatever to
â¢ rfpel them. If his friends intended he should
1 make a personal application, their object was
' loft. Alike indifferent tocenfure asapplaufe,
when unmerited, he had ever done, and as
: far as he could be informed, he would conti
-1 nue to do, what at the time appeared to be
' his duty.
Â» He was as deeply impressed as any gentle
man of this house .could be, with a sense of
> the necessity and importance of fufficient and
I productive fourcss of revenue. Measures
' for defence must be expensiveâwithout the
: means to carry thein into effeit, allouratts
t and resolutions are vain and futile.
5 Protection to our commerce, defence to
( our frontiers and fea-coafls, security to our
r rights as a nation,-entfrg/'and respeCtability
s to the operations of government, are not to
â¢' be obtained without money, and if the pre
sent revenues are not fuftfeient, more must
" undoubtedly be provided.
1 Mr. F. further observed, that he had ever
1 entertained a hope that unless in cafe of an
- aitual invasion, the affelTment of a land tax,
t for the lupport of the measures of thisgo
i vemment, might be avoided. That is the
- unlv remaining refoufcv of some of the state
r governments âthe one to which he belonged
s could resort to no other tor the payment of
- its civil lift, and to discharge a considerable
J debt which it has contracted, and which has
- not been provided for by the general govern-
S ment. Still, however, if the circumstances
â¢ of our country are luch as to require a tempo
Â» ry lup ply from ,t hat quarter, the people will
e not object againlta payment âThey will sub
- mit to the inconvenienee with chearfulnefs,
ii so long as it (hall be found to be necessary
- but they will not feel fatisfied to fee a perma
nent land tax imposed, when other means,
less oppressive in their effeits, and lefsex
penfive in their collection, may be substitu
ted. Such lie believed might be devised,
and if they could not be brought immediate
ly into operation, they might be organized
i in a short period. Additional duties of ex
cite, ftanips and impost, in some instances,
would in his view be preferable to a perma
nent system of direa taxation. Another
measure which appeared to him to merit the
serious conlideration of Congress, and at the
t people throughout the United States, is an
n alteration of the Constitution in fucli manner
e that Congress may be authorized to levy uni
- form duties or taxes on exports. This might
s be made a very produÂ£tivefourceof revenue,to
it be levied in such a manner as to draw the
e principal part, if not the whole, of the tax
k from foreigners, without the least injury or
y inconvenience to our own citizensâbut time
". will be requisite to mature measures of this
- kind. He had not such an antipathy to the
t idea of a dirett tax, but he was willing to
e look at the fubjedt and examine it with can
ls dour.
e Although he.did not mean to pledge him
- felf that he would vote for it, he should be
>r glad to fee a bill before the house ; that op
d jjortunity might be given to examine the
iubjett in detail. Since the motion he had
- submitted, had been thought so exceptiona
n ble, he was willing for the present to modify
I, it. If gentlemen would concur with him in
is a substitute, he would withdraw the motion
y to strike out the word " annuallyand pro
is pose to add as an amendment at the end of
n the resolution the following words :
;t To be collefied for a term not exceeding
d. years ; provided the Legislature of the United
o State:/ball at all times be at full liberty to fub
d Jiitule other duties or taxes of equal value in lieu
thereof, for the pur pose of difebarging any debts
t or loans which may be contratled on the credit of
e said tax.
n Mr. Harper rose to fecoml the motion,
- because it concurred with his ideas on the
subject, that the revenues ought to be com
n menfurate with the debt incurred. He need
d not repeat, he said, that he had always befcn
e opposed to a iand tax, except in the cafe of a
- war, or of preparation for war ; but he now
- believed it necelfary.
Mr. Macon hoped this motion would not
obtain. In the-ftate fr.+ which he came,
they had ap annual Ifuitl tax, And found no
inconvenience'from its being annual. He
had no idea of a permanent tax on land, as all
1 the state governments collected their reve
! nues from thi> source, or from a capitation
tax, every other object having been fe'
upon by the United Sta'es. The idea ol 1Â»e
tax being laid for a number of years,
make it more unpopular than any thing else.
Alt our revenue laws are temporary. But it
was said it was necessary that this tax should
be permanent, in order to obtain loans'upon
it. He believed loans migftt be
obtained upon it.tho* it were palled anhually ;
for certainly tlmfe who lent the government
money would have so much confidence in it
as to believe that it would pay all its contracts
fairly and - honorably. He did not believe
that all the money appropriated could be ex
pended before the next ielfion of Congress.
Besides there is afurplus million in the Frea
fury ready lorany purpose which the Execu
tive thinks proper to apply it to.
It appeared to him as to the gentleman from
Massachusetts, that there might be other ar
ticles of taxation fixed upon. Several other
articles might be excised. A tax might be
laid upon alt mahogany furniture, all furni
ture made of imported materials, all looking
glaires above a certain size, watches of all
. kinds, plate and plated, furniture, prints,
umbrellas, another description of carriages
. might be made, viz. those with plated mount
ing might be made to pay a higher duty than
1 others' American ale, beer and porter,
. might also be excised, and a higher duty put
f' u-pon fuÂ«h as is imported. Hair powder
I would also be a fit object of taxation He
. thought it one of the best â Britith taxes, ?.nd
as we'had some of the worst. we might as w,;.e1l
, have it. All these articles were used by per
-1 sons win could very Wll affdrd to pay the
tax. If any mode could be devised ot railing
. money", exclulively of a land Tajcrvnti ftawp
t 'hn-ildl f
engage 4 in war, we fiioukl "Have distress e
-1 nougli, and a land tax ought to be our last
resource. Congress might go on, he said,
; and have the property afl'efled, without lay
iaganytax. He did not believe this would
â  make any difference, as he doubted whether
1 the aireirment could be made before ftie next
1 feflion.
; But it had been said, advantage ought to
; be taken of the enthusiasm of the moment to
| get this tax. The fame thing was said with
refpeft to the navy. He did not thick it ne
celi'ary to iake advantage of the enthusiasm
1 of the people to collect a tax; the people
, would always obey the laws.
> The gentleman from MafTachufetts (Mr.
1 Otis) had said, that his friends had prophefi
> ed to him that there would be opposition when
, the fubjeft of ways and means came before
s the house. He might also have heard him
- (Mr. M.) fay the fame thing ; and it now ap
: peared that.many who were ready to vote for
expences, were now amongst the molt back
- ward in providing revenue. The house had
f heard an elegant oration from the gentleman
from S. Carolina, and much faid'about France,
s with which he believed we Had nothing to do.
: He wished they might be left to manage their
s own concerns, and fuffer us to take care ofour
own. He hoped this amendment would be
3 negatived, that the law might be negatived,
r Mr. Gallatin considered the discussion
y of this amendment, as a continuation of the
3 discussion ot Saturday last ; the only differ
- eÂ«ce betwixtthe twoqueftionswas,that what
t was then an affirmative, is now a negative po
sition j and those in favour of that, must, ot
r course, be against this. For the original mo
-1 tion of the gentleman front Matrachufetts
, (Mr. D. Foster) was, that t|je tax should be
- laid for one year, and not tor a number of
e years, which implied that it could not be
e pledged for a permanent loan ; but on this
1 day, the fame gentleman has perfectly chang
f ed his ground, for his .morion now establishes
e both principles, viz. that it fltali be laid for a
s number of years, and that it may be pledged
- for a permanent loan. He did not wonder,
s therefore, that the genttenian from S. Caro
lina (Mr. Harper) seconded his motion.
I There could only be two reasons, Mr. G.
- said, why such an amendment lhould obtain,
~ viz. that our permanest expences will be
- such as to render a permanent tax of this kind
- necessary, or else that some temporary ex
>, pence is contemplated far greater than have
- been voted. Neither of these principles were
- proved either by the gentleman from S. Ca
, rolina or the gentleman from Maflachufetts^.
But the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr.
d Harper) instead of argument, took a mode
which he has more than once resorted to, of
>, giving the house some violent general decla
mation about invasion, the fate of Venice, di
r visions at home, weakness, See. which would
e apply to every thing and nothing. This had
e been the theme of the gentleman upon every.
n occasion, and upon every question from the
r repeal of the (tamp act, and the foreign inter
- course bill to the present one ; it was his ge
t neral ground, and in his opinion, did not on
o this occasion require any anfwerânbr could he
e complain of the manner in which he had treat
it ed him, as he had divided his abuse pretty
r impartially between his friend from Malfa
e chufetts and himfelf. He had said that it was
s his (Mr. G's.) objeft to oppose everything
e which went to the defence of the country,and
o that he had too good an opinion of his under
- Handing not to believe that he was sensible
that would be the effett of the motion ; but Â»s
- he did hot believe the gentleman from Maf
e fachufetts made the motion with this view, of
- course, he must believe that it was for the
e want of understanding that that gentleman did
d not fee the effett of his motion.
But without attempting to reply to any
y thing of that kind, and believing that his
n motives and the understanding of the getitle
n man from Maflachufetts flood on as good
- ground at lead as those of the gentleman from
if S. Carolina, and did not stand in need of any
defence, he fhoyld vrocesd to examine that
part of his speech which verged a little to
d wards argument.
That gentleman has said, that there will be
â u much greater expence to be met, than is at
ts present voted. But was it not a very uncdm
9/ inon thing to vote money to pay an expence,
before the expence was authorized > Nay, he
1, believed that the expences already authorized
ie' could not all be incurred in one year.. But
1- fuppofitig the whole of the money could be
d expended during this year, the tax for one
II year would be fufficient for the whole amount
a of the expence authorized.
w It was a perfeftly navel doÂ£trine to attempt
to prejudge, quefliuns. To fay there are other
measures wU! c,h maybe voted ia the affirma
tive. We shall want so nuichmore for (1) s I
and that object, and therefore it will be ne |
ceflary te make the tax permanent, was a cu
fious way of arguirtg. When an e*,pence
,Vas about to be incurred, it always became
a eonfideration whether t'ij means could be
conveniently found, bat h , never knew the
pofEbility of enpence maue an argument in
favor of raising new taxes, before it actu
ally decided "that the expence ft.tild take
place.
'lie confcdl-.f'Tif dirt fiot entertain those
fears which the gentleman from S. Carolina
had erfprelfed, with relpect to this country
being Uthjugate'd, or invaded ; nordid he ip
preliend the divisions at home which ha had
1 fpok.cn of. The necessity ef a (landing army
was the only ground upon which a calculation
of any conliderable additional expence Could
j be farmed ; the house having done all they
thought necelfary fortifications,
arms and gallies. So that there remains no
thing, except an additional or a provihonal
army that can require additional cxpences.
H,e did sot, however, cohlider that fubjefit
before the house ; nordid he believe that any
measure of that kind was necellary. except in
cafe of actual invasion. He did nbt trieart by
invalion, arty depredatory incur(i<jns upon our
territory, which the militia wo)ild be fully
able to meet, but an invalion by a regular ar
myâfor, in ho other cafe would a regular
force be wanted He was not atraid of an
invalion of the CoYintry, because he had full)
confidence in the spirit of the peopleâin the
militia of the country, whose spirit and strength
were perfectly known abroad; and because
he knew that the great maritime exertion ne
cellary to transport any confidcrable force to
this country, arid the didancft at which we'are
, situate from E'urope, renders the idea of an
invasion of any serious kind altogether ridi
culous. He was not afraid of France man
ning her gurt boats to come to this country.
He looked upon the whole as a bugbear. He

appreciated J bm-Â»w-JÂ»4-jAÂ« ; jpviihtygive cuf-
I rency to imaginary fears.
exaggeration, ought to be known, ft' an in
vasion was not apprehended, he saw no rea
son why the tax should be permanent.
But it was said, and the present amendment
recognized the idea, that this tax was wanted
as a pledge for a loan. It must either be want
ed for anticipations, or for a permanent loan.
He would not have made the diftinflion, had
not the gentleman from Malfachufetts (Mr,
Otis) (aid, except this tax was made perma
nent, anticipations could not be got upon it.
This was an extraordinary assertion ; for an.
ticipations are only a sum of money equal to
the amount of a tax and advanced to govern
ment, before the tax is collected, and there
fore it would not be necelfary to lay this tax
for two or three years to fecurp the repay
ment of an anticipation eqtiiil to the amount
ot the tax for one year, if the bank of the
United States was not able or willing to lend
the government two millions of dollars, they
would not do it, even if the tax was laid for
several years. In England, the land tax is
laid yearly,yet the bankof'England constantly
Sc every yaer lends by anticipation to govern
ment its annual amountâBut, in order to en
able the government to make permanent
loans, it was altedged this tax must be perma
nent. If a permanent tax of two millions
was necellary, he wished to know to what a
mount it was intended to borrow money f A
permanent tax to fhif afudutli would, as >ad
been stated by the gentleman from Maryland,
be a security for ten or fifteen minions of dol
lars, leaving a (inking fund of one million of
dollars a year for its repayment. And untefs
a sum of money to this extent was wanted,
there would be no necessity to pledge this tax.
Indeed if the money was wanted for provision
al army, oran auxiliary army, the expence of
which was calculated at eight millions for the
firft year, thfc arguments of gentlemen were
perfectly inapplicable. We do not (land in
need of a land tax on which to bottom a loan
to that amount. It is well know n that there
is a surplus million in our revenue, and will
not that be a fufficient pledge upon which to
bottom a loan for that piirpofe ? No longer
ago than iaft feflion a revenue of 200,000 dol
lars on (lamps was voted for the purpose of a
tjnd to raise a loan upon for the cxpences of
last (eflion ; but the loan lud not been ob
tained, the expences of last fellion had been
defrayed out of the current revenues ; that
fund was now liberated and was a pledge upon
which a loan might be obtained.
It did not appear to be either'prudent or
politic,-to pledge in this manner every reve
nue of the union. If the land-tax was to be
pledged for a number of years, what would
be our situation next year, if involved in war ?
It this last resource was pledged, he knew not
what gentlemen would apply to in future ne
cellities. Great Britain has never to this day,
, pledged her land-tax, amidst all her embar
raflfments.
But it was said, that it may be proper to
render this tax permanent to a certain degree,
as any overplus may go to the discharge of
the public debt. And here lie was charged
with inconfirter.cy, because two ysars ago"iie
wasin favour of a land-tax: It was extraor
dinary, because other gentlemen had changed
their ground, they should charge him wÂ°ith
having changed his. Are not gentlemen who
were againlt a land-tax two years ago, and
who are now for it, so becaule Circumltances
have changed ?_ lie was in favour of a land
tax then, because the revenue was not ,(o
great as at present, and he therefore' changed
liis opinion with the cuvumftances. Look at
the documents on the table, and it would be
found that two years ago the duties arising
from impost and tonnage were only 5,800,000
dollars. At that time he was in favour of a
land tax of 1,200,000 dollars in order te, raise
the revenue up to feven,millions: At present
the revenue from impoAs and tonnage alone
' s 7.5+9,649 dollars ; that item atone gives an"
additional revenue larger by 560,1500 dollars
than what he was desirous to 6btain and the
necessity for a land-tax was done away. It
was moftextraordinary, that because he wi()i
ed to substitute a land-tax for the excise, fait
tax, stamps, and additional impost duties,
now when all thele had taken place that gen
tlemen should infiit that he mult (till be in
favour of a permanent land-tax. He had not
been in favor of a land-tax, from a predelic
tion for taxes generally ; for he thought they
were all attended with inconveruÂ«ncies ; but
j he had been in favour of a land-tax, because
1 additional revenue was then necelfarv, and
I because he preferred that mode'of taxation so
! the others. But now that these other taxes
had been preferred and !sid bv CoflÂ£refs i-i
oppolition to his own opinion, and now that
the additional revenue had been procured by
'lose mean*, ha had no wilh to lay a perma
nent land-tax in addition lo the others. But
he was called upon to vote in favour of tl i#
tax, because he had heretofore called the
public debt a curse, asa part ol this tax might
go to pay oft that debt, and in order to be
confifteut, he oughlt to (upport it. It wsS
tfue that he contidered the public debt as a
evil, and ito gentleman ori
that floor, vthen he coniidered that three or
four million dollars a year were paid for the
jnmeft and partial iiiftaliuciits of the debt,

posed tCpay it offat bnci. There would be

rApidly, as would a rife from a negliil to dil-
any part of it. It ought only to lie

1 collected that the greater part was owned a
. broad. The calculation lie hid made for-
I merly ,was to. pay off the fateign debt in twelve
years ; and he believed no gentleman cpuld
rhillk.it ought to be paid in lels ; and the lix
per cent, and (lock in 23 years ac
cording to contract. With respeCt to the 3
per cent, (lock, gentlemen Ihould recollect
that it could not be reduced in that wjjy. _lt
would be folly to pay ios. in the pound lor
that debt. \V'e have another resource which
will be equal to the payment of that, viz. the
land of the United States, this had been hiÂ»
object at all times, it was still what he con
templated, and Jifwe do that, and keep from
war, or increased expences, there will not be
much danger to be apprehended troni that
debt.
But it was extraordinary that gentlemen'
Ihould speak of rtijucingtlie public debt, oi\
the present occasion, wnilft, by the very a-'
mendment under consideration, the tax was
to be rendered permanent for the sole purpose
of pledging it for a loan and of encrealing the
public debt: Gentlemen are hot willing ta
vote it from year to year because they v.ifh to
go further into the funding system. They
want a tax as a pledge upon which to borrow
money, and ypt talk of payire ptf the old dtbt.
If that tax Ihould neither be wanted so sup
port an additional army, nÂ«r as a pledge for a
. loan, nor as a fund to meet the permanent
J expences of the union after the year ISOO,
from part experience, he had no delire to 111-
crease our revenue beyond our wants. He
had already stated that the present revenue is
lulicient for the present expences, and to pay
oft" the public debt within as (hort time as it
would be desirable to pay it off, a)id he could
1 not think it defifable, therefore, to extend the
{ tax further than from year to year,
r Gentlemen tell others, that the tax may be
s at any time repeated, if it Ihould not be want
s ed ; but from what hs had seen heretofore,
he cho(e rather to leave the power in that
house ofcontiniiingit or not. He had nevei*
seen any proportions' succeed for repealing a
tax j oivthe contrary, as our revenue increales,
our expencet are made to keep pace with
them. A new regiment, or a few additional
1 frigates, or some new eftablilhment, will at
1 any tim/i confuine any surplus of revenue
, which may be on hand. This had neretofore
been the practice of this government, and he
f expected it would continue to be so. Indeed,
s it was ,the tendency of all governments. It
, was the tendency of manâw hen a perfou
. grows rich, helooksoutforobjectsof expence,
on which to employ his fuperfluous wealth,
f Hewilhed, therefore, inprder to prevent this
: extension of expence without neceflity, to
: confine the taxes and the revenue to the ex
-1 penct already created.

i kits a year were (ufficient to pay the whole of
( the Dutch debt in twelve years,

.'i but because a man may overlook the tendeu!
* - â¢
\VOJ,ume XIII.cy of a nation, does it follow that he is a
blockhead? Certainly not.
I'he foundation of the speech of the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania was laid on the
supposition that theie could be no increa(e of
ex . ence in our government, except from the
ra ling of a provisional army, or an increase
of the present army. But is this a true state
of thefaÂ£t l Were the go,ooo militia order
ed to be hel3 in readiness to produce no ex
pence ? The gentleman had all along spoken I
of militia as if they could be called into ser
vice without eypence. Did not he know,
that when they were called out, there wopid
be the expence of camps, tents, pay, and all
the expences of a regular army, except the
enliffment and bounty paid td soldiers. So
that he could not fee any groat difference-in
expenre be'wixt calling out the militia, or
raifingan army, except in the article of boun
ty, as he had mentioned. He therefore ap
prehended tHat the calling of these militia in
to service might be'attei*'ed with an expence
of twenty millions of dollars, and the Presi
dent may,' next week, if he thinks proper,
call any number of them into service.
The next argument of the gentleman is e
qnally fallacious. Admitting that govern
ment may have occasion tor loans, yet the
fur phis million of revenue in the Treasury
would be a fufficient bottom for them. But .
was it certain that we should have no other
expences besides that of providing for addi
tional military force? Could it b<Â»faid no
more money would be wanted under the 6th
article of the Britidi treaty ? He recollefled
when that subject was under debate, that a
gentleman from Virginia had said, it would
produce an expence offifteen millions of dol
lars. *He never believed any such sum Would
be wanted. 300,000 dollars had already been
appropriated, and he supposed the whole ex
pence might amount to betwixt two and three
millions.
And yet the gentleman from Pennsylvania
was willing the revenue of the country should
depend upon its present (in cafe of war) un
certain refo'wrces. And this was the basis to
be offered to monied men, as a security for
their money. It was in vain to fay how much
more than the two millions would be wanted.
He believed it was the intention to fill the
blank in this amendment with two or three
years, and then, if iv? had not had occasion
to incur any extraordinary expences, or make
any heavy loans, the tax would come to an
end. But suppose this amendment isrejetted,
and the bill is confined to one year's duration,
it will in a great measure defeat the purpose
of the bill.
As to the declaration which,the gentleman
from Pennsylvania dated fcim as nfing, lie
vould affiire htm that he should not eeale to
cail the attentioivof the House to the dangers
of the country, and though he might contin
ue to adminilter anodynes as'much as he plea
jfal, he would be doomed to hear him, whilst
â¢he uas-a member of that House, warn them
against the effects of his foporifics. Mr. H.
again adverted to the situation of Europe,
and to the probability of an attack upon this
country, which he said the gentleman from
Pennsylvania might call declamation, but
which he called truth. He hoped, however,
the attack would not be made ; and if not,
the expence would not be incurred. If the
law passed with a principle similar to this a
mendir.ent, he believed a loan would soon be
filled up. He knew it would be done chiefly
from patriotic motives ; but those who ad
vance .money will, notwithstanding, expert to
have a folicHroj e oTareimburfement of their
money ; and if this should be refufed, the
country would be left defencel'fs for want of
pecuniary refoiircfis'. This, he supposed,
â would be bad economy; and he could not
help entering his protest against this system,
â whatever may be the motives which lead to
it.
Mr. FiNDtEY said, it was admitted on all
hands," that it depended on a contingency
whether this tax would be wanted g.t all. For
his own part, he was under no apprehension
ot any formidable invasion of this country |
taking place before Congress meets again. If
France is desirous of leaking conquests, the re
are much preferable objects to this country,
nearer home. The difficulties which have
so long agitated Europe, are not yet so far
fettled, as to fuffer Franca to fend out any
formidable force here. Let the condiift of
the French government have beep as bad as
it can be painted, it cannot !be said that
it has ever wholly loft fight of its own inter
eff; and it would not be her interest to make
an'invafiou of this country at this time ; and
therefore there is no neceflity for going into
meafurss as if an invading army was immedi
ately expelled amongst us.
A land-tax was with him a favorite tax.
He h.id long wished it. He was for adopting
it some time ago, and for taking advantage
of alow market, to have bought up the pub
. lie debt. Bui when he came to into
the fubjfrft, he found that many of the States
had laid direel taxes for the support of their
own government. There is now an appear
ance of neceflity for this tax ; butbeinga new
tax under the general and not
likely to be very to some parts of
the Union, it would be proper to make the
law of short duration. Upon constitutional
ground, he was against continuing a direel
tax longer than two years j every Congress
ought to pass a vote upon it, but in the pre
sent indance he believed the law would be
best pafled for one year only.
Bnt it was faidthis tax nnift be permanent,
as a bottom to loans. This was exprefling a
distrust of future Congrefles, which he tho't
improper- B ut it was asserted that neither
public institutions nor monied citizens would
lend their money on the credit of Congress,
withoM a permanent source of revenue was
provided as a security. Are gentlemen jufti
fied by experience in this opinion I He be
lieved not. Mr. F. mentioned several instan
ces to (hew the contrary, and doubted not
the fame readiness would again appear in aid
of government whenever it wanted it.
Mr. F. was of opinion that if power was
given to the President to raifc 20,000 men, as
a provisional army, they could be got before
the next session of Congress. Officers might
be app6inted, and he had no doubt they
would. If these men were not raised, and
any occasion should call for military service,
the militia, of course, would be resorted to.
But w as there any reason to believe that more
militia would be called out in the course of
the year than one year's land-tax would pro
vide for? He could not believe thertf would.
He supposed every gentleman would vote
according lo the idea he had of the.contin
gency which had been mentioned being likely
V 6 take place, or otherwise. Difficulties
would always attend the laying of a new taX ;
and w hen it should be necetfary to lay a direst
tax he would have it for some confTderable
ftim) as the expence of collecting would be
the fame whether it was for a large or a small
amount. Though it plight prove difagreea
bl< to the people, they will pay it if neteffa
v â¢ but, laid he, let it be tried for a year,
and do not difgult the people by giving them
a'n idea that they (ball never S et rid of the
J.? entlemen might again be told, that they
rcfufe to provide any means of defence for the
country, that this is a leaf.clf the fame book,
&c\ But could it be supposed, said Mr. F.
that he should mind foVh charges i Or was
it to be ctedited that the people would be
lieve that he who had been enfplojMd/in the
formation of this government, and in execu
ting it everfince it existed, and wfio hadrifk
ed every thing to*btain it, should now re
fufe to support any measure which was calcii-
I lated to (jefend it ? It could not. They will
not believe these aspersions. ,
Mr. F. concluded by observing that if this
law was pad for one year, he could confi
dently rely on future Congrelfes to renew it, I
if the situation of the country should require
it.' It would not hereafter be convenient for
him to take auy farther (hare in the publifc
councils, but not diftrufl the wis
dom and patriot 11 of those who might fallow
him ; and to do away the charges continually
made againlt himfelf and others, that they
were not willing to defend the country, he
Qiould the, yeas and nays upon every
question of'defence which came before the
House.
Mr. S. Smith did not like the amend
ment ; but he should vote for it, because if
he could not get all he wished, he would get
all he could. If the. blank was to be filled
with two or three years (as had been intimat
ed) it would not go far enough to induce mo
nied men to rely upon it as a permanent se
curity.
There seemed to be no difference of opinion
as to the proyriety of laying a direst tax ; it
only seemed to be as to the length of time for
which it to be laid. He agreed with
those gentlemen who allert that money can,
not be borrowed, except a permanent fund be
provided. But gentlemen fay where are your
expences f Certain expences have been agreed
to, which are proposed to be met by a direil
tax ot two millipns ; but could it be suppo
sed that the proceeds of this tax could be
brought into theTreafuryinlefs than eighteen
months ? They could not, and something must
be done in the mean time to raise the money
already voted, whether any war takes place,
or not. How was this to be don? ? By loans
alone. But what inducement will there be to
monied men to lend money, except a perma
nent revenue be made the security ? You ho! 4
out the credit of the United States,which has
not heretofore been injured. This is true.
But heretofore we have not been engaged in
war; we have had nothing to impede our
Revenue. But if a war takes place, it is pofli
ble our revenue may fuffer very materially :
and Congress are*Â» provide a fund,
which in theopinion of some will leave no per
manency, &Â»ntheopinionofothers, very little.
And would it not requirg a great degree of
fiatriotifm in gentlemen to lend twenty fhil
ings for twenty (hillings, when they can go
into the market, and purchase them with fix -
teÂ«n. The difference of opinion on this fuD
jeft, he was convinced, arose from the differ
ent pursuits of the members of that house.
Certain gentlemen believed monied men
would advance money without a perma
nent tax as a security. He believed the
contrary ; for however great a confidence
they may have in the honour ot future
Congrefles, they would wish to fee this Con
gress do something for their security. He fear
ed gentlemen were not in earned when they
spoke of defending the country. We have
men, said he, but we want money. He did not
agree with the gentleman from N. Carolina
(Mr. Williams) that flaws fought for money,
and freemen only for liberty. If he commanded
a regiment of Militia, he believed they would
expeil to be paid, and he could not believe
he would term them (laves. Money must be
had.
Thegentlanianfrom Pennsylvania wasafraid
of making the Revenue permanent, because as
our revenue increased, it had been usual, not
to repeal our revenue laaÂ«s,butto increase our
expences. Whence did he colleft this infor
mation ? Not from the documents on the ta
ble ; for there he would find that there was
an unexpended surplus of .one million nine
hundred tlioufand dollars, which were in 1797
applied by the Commissioners of the Sinking
Fund to the reduction of the Public Debt.
We have, (aid he, gone on decreasing our .ex
pences. It was true, that ourdifpute with Al
giers, and a war with the Indians, had cost a
great deal of money ; but when the war with
the later wa* at an end our expences were de
creased. And now an income of expence is
asked for to repel threatened danger; and
gentlemen have voted measures of defence ;
but now they come to touch the expence they
flinch. Men may memorialize and talk about
defence as long as they please, it will avail
nothing, without money.
But gentlemen fay, before we raise money,
let us wait to fee whether it will be necefTary.
They might as well fay, " let us wait till we
are devoured," which would be the cafe if we
neglefted to raise money until our enemy was
at the deor.
But gentlemen call for a statement of ex
pence. He would remind them, that it was
proposed to raise a Provisional Army of at
lead 10,000 men, which would cost four mil
lions dollars a year. It wasalfo proposed that
the President mould have power to call out
20,000 militia to be trained, and the payment,
of them mud be provided for. It would not
be right to leave the President without mo
ney. At the time you give him the authority
to raise, and call out men, you must give him
than some other gentlemoti, because he knew
the difficulty attendant on the raifingof money.
Mr. Otis said, the gentleman last up had
anticipated some of the observations which he
intended to have made ; but he would fug
ged a few remarks in favour of the present
motion. ,
The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Gallatin) had used arguments to (hew, that no
tax of this fort is necessary. He (hould not re
ply to any arguments of this fort, because the
committee have already decided upon the
quantity and principle of the tax. But, if he
was under the neceflity of answering such ob
servations, he would refer to the gentleman's
own book, (which however he had not yet
read, but meant to read) and because the Se
cretary of the Treasury and the Committee of
Ways and Means, had recommended a dirsft
tax as the only source which could.be depend
ed upon for a permanent revenue.
But it had been said, no invasion could be
expefted to take place. His opinion was,
however, though the danger might not be
very great, it ought to be guarded agaiaft.
In a certain pajt of the country at lead, he
believed there was considerable danger : In
deed the house has voted considerable films
for defence, and there remains, according to
the report of the committee of Ways and
Means, a balance unprovided for, of 1,396,705
dollars, for the meeting of which the commit
tee have recommended a land tax of two (nit
ons. And if the tax was voted, it ought to
be voted in such a way as that the money
maybe railed; and he thought the gentle
man from Pennfylvariia had taken a greater
latitude in his observations than he complain
ed of in the gentleman from S. Carolina who
I had held up a piiture Before their eyes, of
which the house ought continually to be re
minded. He liad already dated tjiat this mo
ney mwft be borrowed, and that it could not
be got, rf the tax was hid in the usual way.
A man who has money to Jend will not part
with it without a certainty of being
It had been said, that it was not improbable
that the enemy might make a landing in some
of the fouthem states. Suppoie they were to
do so, and keep pofleflion ol a part of the
country for some time, the present tax could
not be draws from thence. Momed men
would take such an event into their calculati
on, and they would a prudently 111 doing 10,
because the o'lier parts ot the country would
not be liable to up the deficiency. In
I such a cafe, the creditor would have nothing
â¢to depend upon blit the faith of government,
and he migh't as: well depend upon that 111 the
ftrft instance as to lend his money upon an un
certain security. There would also be the
tfvpence .ps collection to be deducted, which
fuppofed would not be less than 10 per
cent. Considering all these circumstances, it
"he was the Director of a Bank, or had the
mOney to lend, he-would not lend more than
one million upon this two million tax. The
gentleman from Pennfylva<iia had said, that
Great Britain never mortgaged.her land tax
for a number of years, though he acknow
ledged they annually anticipated it. No man,
Mr. O. said, would lend his money without
considering the rilk he ran in doing so, and he
thought it was mucji less in England than in
this country at this time. The principle
which he wiflied to engraft in the bill was,
that the tax Iheuld be continued until the
money which had been borrowed upon if
ftiould be repaid. Not that he was in favour
of a land tax. He should himfelf pay as
large a proportion of this tax as any man
whole property was not larger than his ; be
cause of his little fortune, a greater part was
in land than in any thingelfe. He was there
fore interested in preventing the tax. If it
were to pass, however, he wilhed it to be ef
fectual.
Mr. Varnum hoped the motion under
consideration would be negatived. The gen
tleman from Maryland (Mr. S. Smith) gave
two reasons on Saturday, against striking out
the word annually. One was that it was ne
cellary the tax should have some permanency,
in order that money might be borrowed upon
it, and another that it might be a substitute
for indirect taxes. That gentleman allowed,
and he perfectly agreed with him in opinion,
that in cafe of war, the defalcation in our re
venue hejdid not suppose would be large, and
that in our present situation he had no ideaot
a defalcation. If then, a defalcation of Â® or
revenue was not sol>e expected, he thought
he ftioulif be able to make it appear, that the
proposed tax is not neceflary at all ; and, ot
course, that it will not be right to pass it lor
more than one year. But the gentleman from
Maryland fays the people ought to be reliev
ed from Indirect Taxes, because for every
i2Â§ per cent duty the consumer pays 274.
Does that gentleman wilh then that the mer
chant (hould be deprived of a profit of 15 per
cent, on the duties which he now pays ( If
so, this might be very well effected, without
doing away the duty, and substituting a land
tax in its place, by the merchants lowering
he price of their goods 15 per cent!
But the gentleman added another reÂ»fon,
for jading the law for a number of years, viz. ;
that this tax might be at any time repealed, j
But, although this house might consent to a 1
repeal of this tax, it'was by no means cer- !
tain that the other house would consent to its j
repeal. Indeed, it was his opinion, that it {
1 this tax was eftablilhed as a permanent tax, j
that the people of this country would not be
relieved trom it for many years. Many ob
jects, he had no doubt, would be found out,
by gentlemen ever fruitful in this respeCt,
upon tfhich to expend any surplus which
might arise from this tax.
The gentleman from S. Carolina, on Sa
turday, brought into view our situation with
\efpe4t to France, and our liablenefs to an
attack from that nation. He alluded to the
conversion which-took place betwixt our
envoys and X. Y. & 2. and thence inferred
that it was probable this country would be
attacked by France. He could not fay that
all the propositions made by these unautho
rized persons were not from the Directory;
but there was no evidence of"this, and there
fore he could nor believe it, especially as the
Agents themselves declared they were not.
He thought, therefore, if we wifked to pre
serve peace with France, that we ought not
to be too forward in believing that all which
was said by X. Y. and Z. was authorized by
the French government. He hoped it would
prove to be the conrtary, and that when the
Directory (hall discover what has been done,
they will punijh these persons for their con
duct.
The gentleman from S. Carolina had fre
quently introduced to the view of the house
the situation of Switzerland, Venice, Spain,
Holland, and other countries. As to him
felf he.had no idea of elpoufing the cause.
of those countries; it was fufficient in his o
pinion that we defended our own. In doing
this, he would go as far as any man, but he
did not wilh to go to Venice or to Rome to
fight in the cause of the Pope. What was
meant by .ob&rrattons like these, but to pre
pare the minds of the people for a situation of
things which that gentleman expefted and
wilhed lor I And it gentlemen did not come
into all his views, he immediately charges
them with not being willing to defend their
country; with being flow to protett their
wives and their children. He (hould have
supposed that men who had left their /ami
lies, and fought for their country for eight
years together, would now feel the neceflity
of defending their wives and children, as
much as that gentleman who never had either.
But it appeared to him that the gentleman
from S. Carolina, in making the observations
which lie did, departed from the principle l(-
tabliflied by the committee of ways and means,
of jvhich he is the chairman. They have
stated that no additional revenue is wanted,
except to meet the extraordinary expences of
the present feflion. Amongtheleextraordinary
expences are 340,000 dollars for fortifications,
and for the procuring of cannon, arms, and
ammunition 900,000. If the fortifications
are once completed, they surely will not want
completing a second time ; and the appropri
ation for providing cannon, arms and ammu
nition could not be conlidered as an annual
expence but merely as an expence for the
present year. Was not this also the cafe
with refpedt "so the naval armament ? He ho
ped it was not intended that 950,000 dollars
fhould'be appropriated annually for this ob
jeft. If this Ihould hereafter'be determin
ed, Congress would of course provide the
means for effecting it.
Mr. V. supposed the calculation of the a
mount of duty arising from imports and ton
nage for the prelent year, might very fafely
be taken at the actual receipts of last year,

Treafury,that inconsequence of the depreda
tions committed upon our trade, theie mas
be a deficiency of revenue in the present year,
and upon this probability the committee of
ways and means have grounded their report..
He flieuld wifli to view the fubjeit with can
dour, and not to deceive himfelf. He kpew
that fimilarobfervations had been made from
year t'o year, lince depredations had been
committed upon our commerce by foreign
nations, but he also knew that faCts had shewn
themjo be ill founded. In the year 1795,
tbedifcy srifing from this source was 5,588,961
dollars; In 1796, 6,567,987 ; and in 1797,
7,549,649 dollars. And he had no doubt the
revenue from imports and tonnage for the
prefeht year would increase in the fame pro
portion in which it has ihcreafed for the three
years part, and if so, that alone would â¢pro
duce upwards of eight millions aiid an half ot
dollars. Allowing that the imports and ton-.
nagejwUl make 8,500,000
Ada the additional imports laid at
the last winter feflion, and. the
fait tax of the summer feflion
which at a moderate calculation
will amount to 600,000
The stamp tax 200,000
To which add the various other ar
ticles of revenue mentioned a
bove, amounting to 7 g 7>3*B
Alio add the estimated increase of
the internal revenue . 125,000
And the whole wi',l amount to 10,212,388
From which deduct the whole ex
pences of the present year, as
stated by the committee of ways
and means, viz. 9.808,603
And there will remain a surplus of 403,785
But it was probable that the revenue ari
sing from imports and tonnage fevould consi
derably exceed the sum he had mentioned ;
for, according to the amount of the duties a
riling from the firft quarter of the present
year, the revenue from that source alone
would.amount to ten millions of dollars, in
which caCe thc whole revenue may be estima
ted at ii,Hi,3*B dollars, and would leave a
of the fiibjeCt was corrcfl it
appeared to him-if the proposed tax was laid
at all, it ought not to be for tnore than one
year. If gentlemen had any thing in view
which was not before the house he could not
speak to that. But if the United States were
under the neceflity of borrowing fifteen mil
lions of dollafs, there was no,neceflity for this
tax for that purpose, as the iurplus million,
three hundred thousand dollars accruing an
nually, was a fufficient security for the pay
ment of the interest on a loan to that amount.
He was against continuing the tax for a lon
ger period than one year for another reason.
I It was to becollefted from houses, lands and
! Haves. This, in, the part of the country from
â  whence he same would operate very unjustly.
j In the state of Massachusetts the people pay
annually for the interest of their state debt,
] expences of the civil department, county and
J town charges, support of the poor, highway
I taxes, and for the support of public schools
| and ministers ot thegofpel, a direct tax of be
tween 12 and 1300,000 dollars. This tax is
collected from polls, and from real and per
sonal estates. with some few exceptions* and it
1* found that persons holding small farms
there, and who have families to bring up, find
it difficult to pay these taxes. This additi
onal tax will therefore fall very heavy upon
this dais of people, as they will principally
have to bear the burden, being wholly laid
upon houses and tlip landed property in that
quarter of the }imon. No tax, therefore,could
be calculated to excite fomuchdlflatisfattion
in that part of the United Stares as this. The
people will certainly pay it, if it be laid, but
they will not do it cheartully. He should,
therefore, be against laying the tax for more
than one year.
The qucftion was put and negatived 46 to
35-
Mr. D. Foster then renewed his motion
to strike out the word annually', which was
carried, there being 60 votes for it.
The question on .the amendment providing
for the taking of a new cenlus, was put and.
carried, there being 57 votes for it.
Mr. Reed moved an amendment which
went to strike out the provision which propo
ses that the tax shall be laid by an uniform
rule through all the states, with the view of
inserting in its place the following words,
" and upon such other estates uuiibin each parti
cular state as is taxable according to the eftablifb
ed rule Of direfl taxation in each state."
The motion was negatived, there being 21
votes for it. '
The report was referred to the committee
of ways and means, to report bills according

to our country, to ourselves, and to poffe

to offer every fuppprt in in our power to the

clare to yon Sir, that we are of opinion yon
have done every-thingthat under theexiftiirg

garu-fo ttie general fafety, tree honour, and

through the unexampled perfidy and unpa

GENTLEMEN,
The generous sentiments of approbates
a I'd confidence conveyed in this nervous ad
dress, command my particular refpedt.
I had never until lately, any expe&ation,
that I should live to fee, unremitted depre,
dations committed on our commerce ; wan
too cruelties exercised on our seamen ; our
general government traduced ; the Execu
tive authority vilified, and our very exig
ence threatened, through the means of our
citizens or any other with impunity. I had
no suspicion indeed, that mankind would
ever have taken it into their heads, to try o
ver again, experiments which had been a
million times tried, and always found evil.
lam happy in your opinion, that every
thing has been done, under the exiftingcir
cureliances, that could be done by me, withr
a "due regard to the general fafety, true hon
or andeffentialintereftsof the United States.
Wi*h you I clearly agree, that nothing fur
ther can be a'i*T pted, confidently with the
maxims that conllitute the basis of our na
tional sovereignty.
Your cordial approbation of my adminis
tration of the Executive Government, in all
refpefts is highly honorable and affediug to
me.
Should our enemies aiTail usat home, yott
will have no reason to doubt of the energetic
concurrence of the Legislative Branches,
whose knowledge of our ample resources,
must give them all needfar'y firmnefs ; whose
pc-suasion of the justice of our cause, will
enable them to make the lad appeal when
necefTary, and whose American hearts, will
prompt them to support their country, with
their lives and fortunes in common with their
fellow-citizens.

A number of the Officers of the Militia of N eiczafle

fxtrtance- of the present crifts of public affairs, io the hap
s inefs and independencepf the United States ; aud conceiv
ing that the unjtijl and imperious conduft of the Republic
ef Francs toivards America, has been dictated in a great,
measure by the unfounded riifreptcfentations of her own
agents, and some tnifguidei and deluded citizens of this
country. that the people and the government -were divided
and opposed to each other ; tve fee} ourselves conflrained
by every cons deration of duty to the conjlituted authorities,
to'ourfelves, and to our country, to repel the insinuation
which thus attempts to dijhonor the American characterâ¢
Appreciating with due efiimation, the advantages of
neutrality and the blessings of peace, we have beheld with
pleasure and entire fatifaÃion your earntjl and repeated
endeavors, and those of your pxedceffor, to preserve this
durable pfdion ; and we have seen with equal regret,
that the anxious advances of our government towards a
reparation of haYtnony with the French republic, htive
been received with contemptuous disregard on their part ;
and at the moment wben negotiation pyght to have produced
redrefsy aggrtffion has been increased, and further depre
dations authorized, under the vain hope of inducing a
compliance with the xoretched demands of avarice and cor
tup tion.
Little does France under{land the American character
ht fifipoftng we arc to be frightened intt) mean compliances,
by. holding up to out view her dependant allies, a degraded
Genoa, or a dismembered Venice. The picture raises jujl
indignation in the minds of freemen, and will Jlimulate
their exertions to avid a ftmilar fate.
With pain do we discover in the infant y of the Trench

ttpan the rights of man, the evidence* of an aSiive corrup
tion that would degrade the mojl profligate tyrannyâFor

was carried 60 votes being for it. Some other
amendments of small importance were agreed
to, and then the committee rose and the seve
ral motives which had been agitated in the
committee of the whble were named in the
house (on most of which the Yeas artd Nays
were taken) and the bill was ordered to be
read a third time to-morrow: A call of the
house was made by Mr. Sitg reaVes at half

attendance at thepaflage of this bill.
On the twenty-sixth of .April Bache publilh
ed in his paper a lift of fifteen veflels at Cape-
Nichola-MoleâYefterday he published a lift con
taining the names of eleven of the fame veflels j
the preemption is, that the ether four have been
liberated. In this way the number of Britilh
captures is enereafedâthe fame vessels have been
publilhed in the fame papers three or four times
over. While scarcely a single t<fl of French pi
racy is noticed by Bache he has the modesty to
call on the editor of this Gazette to republilh the
twice told tale of the above lift at Cape-Ni
cheta Mole !
Both houses of the refpe<Sive legiflaturet of
the States of ConneiSHcut and Khode-Ifland have
unanitrtcufly voted addresses to the legiflaturc
and executive of the United States, assuring
them of their entire confidence and support in
the measures of government for the maintenance
of our sovereignty and independence.
Very little information is to he derived trom

A late paper contains a Iketch of a deb:.te in the
council ot'soo of ift and 6th March, on a motion
for an enquiry intothe execution of the lawof the

emigrants found ip the republic. This motion
wai referred to a committee and a mellage on

feffional abilities, we have to request the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to

universally adopted by tfoem to invalidate the taÂ«*
lents of eftablilhed artists with a view of

their profeflional knowledge in ro wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opinion mult
