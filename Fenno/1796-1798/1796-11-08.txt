BY. those who attended to Hie oppofitioft of Mr.
'â  [effetfon, while secretary of ft ate, to the mcafurcs
of the tre/fftiry department, it waÂ» made a quelliÂ»n>
whether that oppofttion flowed altogether from his
hojlility to tin: head of that drparlnmt (whofc com
petition might, at a future period, be apprehended,
and whose deJlruSi-m was therefotp defitable) or
from hit entertaining principles respecting public
credit and national faith, very different from rhofe
which have influenced all nations, who cherish those
valuable pillars of national flrength.
As his conduct, while rainilter of t?'; United
States at Paris, in relation to this fubjett, may
throw great light on his principles, I (hail proceed
to date the exact tenor of the ttdvttt whicjh Nlr.
Jefferfoti gave to cotigrefs, rÂ«fpeÂ£ti/>g the transfer
of the debt due to France, to a company of Holland
ers. After mentioning an offer which had been
made by such a company for the purehafe of the
debt, he concludes with these extraordinary expres
sionsâ" If there is a danger of the public pay
ments not be'mg punctual, I submit whether it may
not be better, that the discounts which would then
arise, should be transferred from a court, of whose
good will we have so mveh need, to the brtafis of' a
private company
The above ic an extract which was trade ftom
the letter in February 1787. The date of it was
not nÂ«ted, but the original being on the tiles in the
department of state, will ascertain that, aÂ»d all o
ther particulars, relating to its contentsâThe ge
nuinenefiof the extradl may be depended upon.
This letter was the fubjeit of a report from the
board of trcafury, in February 1787: That board
treated the idea of t'rantfer proposed as both un
just and iMFOUTtc: unjujl, bccaufr thÃ nation
would contract an engagement, which there was no
welt grounded prt/peÃ of fulfilling ; impolitic, be
cause a failure in the payment of inteteft on the
debt transferred (which was wevitoblc) would jufl
ly blajt all hopes of credit with the citizens of the
United Netherlands, in future prefling exigences of
the Union ; and the board gave it as their opinion,
that it would be advisable for congress, without de.
lay, to inftruÃ their minister at the court of France,
to forbear giving his fcindiov to any such transfer.
Congress agreeing in the ideas of the board,
caused an inflruSion to that effect to be sent to Mr.
Jefferfon. Here there was a foltmn ad of govern
ment condemning the principle as unjujl and impolitic.
If the sentiment contained io the extract, which
has been recited, can be vindicated from poli.
tical profligacyâtUrn is it necejfary to unlearn all the
ancient notions of juflice, and to fabftittite some
new-fafhioned scheme of morality in their ftcad.
Here it no complicated problem, which sophistry
may entangle or ebfettre. Here is a plain question
of moral feeling. A government is encouraged on
j tbe express condition of not having a projpeH of mak
-3 ing a due provision for a debt which it owes, to con
cur in a transfer of that debt horn a nation, well able
. to bear the inconveniences of failure or delay, to
individuals, whose total ruin tn ,^r
confeotwy j" f *?" 1 tlit inlerefltd
-â¢tliiiiÃjffifl Â»T having need of the good-will of
the creditor nation, and, with the dishonorable mo
tive, as is clearly implied, of having more to. ap
prehend from the discontents of tha't nation, than
' from those of disappointed and betrayed individuals.
Let every benej and impartial mind, consulting its
own spontaneous emotions, pronounce for itfelf
upon the reflitudeof such a suggestion.
An effort, fcatcely plausible, has been heretofore
j m Â» d Â« by the partirans of Mr. jefferfon, to explain
away the turpitude of this advire> It was repre
sented, that "a company of adventuring fpecttlatots
had offered to purehafe the debt at a discount, fore
feeing the delay of payment, calculating the proba
ble loss, and willing to encounter the hazard."
But the terms employed by Mr. Jefferfon refute this
species of apology. His words are, â¢Â« if there j* a
- " danger of the public payments not being punSual, 1
" " full rait whether it nay net be better, that the dif
' " contents which would then arise, should be transfer
" red from a Court of whose good will we have so
<Â« much need, to the breajls of a private company."
He plainly takes it for granted, discontents
VWQuld arise from the want of an adequate provision,
and proposes that they should be transferred to the
breads of individuals. This he could not have
takfn for granted, if, in his conccption, the pur,
chafers bad calculated on delay and loss.
The true conftru6Uon then is, that the company
expelled to purehafe at an under valtie, from the
probability that the court of France might be wil
ling to raise a pam of money on this fund, at a fa
crif.eeâfuppofwg that the United States, counting
on her friendly indulgence, might be left inclined to
preftthe reimbursement; not that they calculated
on material delay, ur nrgleft, when rhe transfer
\ should be made to them, They probably made Â«
very different calculation, (to wit) that as it would
be ruinous to the credit of the United States abroad, to
neglcdi any part of its debt, which wat contra&ed
there with individuals, from the impossibility of one
part being diftinguilhable from another in thrpub
lie apprehension ; thit confidcration. would fiimulate
to exertions to provide for it; And so it it evident
from his own words that Mr. Jffiftn underflood it.
But the persons whe offered to parchale were
by the apologitt called Speculator. The cry
of fpeculdtion, as usual, was raifedj and this, with
some people, was the panacea, the umverfal cure for
fraud and breach of faith.
I( is true, as wag alledgcd by the apologist, Mr.
Jefferfon mentioned an alternative, the obtaining oj.
money by nth loant, to reimburse the court ol
J > France; but this is not mentioned in any way that
| derogates from or waves the advice given in the firft
inttance. He merely prefentj an alternative, in
cafe the firft idea should be disapproved.
It may be added the advice refpefting the trans
fer of the debt was little more honorable to the
United States, as it regarded the court of France,
than as it Dutch company. What a
:e blemish on our national charaÃer, that a debt of so
jj sacred a nature should have been transferred at so
â conjiderable a loss to so meritorious a creditor.
