The commillionerÃ appointed by the go

viating the distress of the citizens of Phila
delphia, and the fubiirbt thereof in confe
qucnce of the late calamity,
To the benevolent donors who came for
ward to give relief to our fuffering fellow
cLizens at one of those trying periods which
seldom happen in any country.
It is to you that we conceive it our duty
to address at this time ; not only bÂ«caufe it
belongs to yoirto be acquainted with thi
appropriation of your money that was en
trafted to us as your agents, but likewise
to give vent to feelings of gratitude that are
engraven on our minds, for the generous
anAfpontaneous supplies deposited in our
hands, at a moment when our thoughts
deeply engaged to find out ways and means
to afford relief to about fix thoulatid distress
ed mcR, women and children, who had be
come objefts of our care, i.i consequence of
having received fuppoit from the sum grant
ed by the Legislature, which was entirely
expended by the eighth of Oftober: At
this juncture we called on our felloe-citi
zens, and wera anfw<fred v.ith that noble
ness of spirit which characterizes oUr coun
try, by receiving in cash upwards of twenty
thousand five hundred dollars, cxclufive of
three hundred and thirty five barrels, and
sixty hundred, three quarters and fifteen
pounds in bags of wheat, ryo, buckwheat,
and indian meal ; besides potatoes and sun
dry other kinds of provifioti : aided by the
above, and assisted by a nunjbtr of respec
table inhabitants of the city, northern liber
ties, and Southwark ; we ate enabled to
continue relieving, by weekly donations, a
bove thirteen hundred perfom, chiefly heads
of families, opprefled by poverty sickness
and distress, and to give employment to a
beut fix hundred men on the road 3 ; who if
not provided for in that tÂ»anrifr would, in
all probability, have been, from dire ne<jflTs
- compelled to defcetid to means injurious
to themselves and to the community.
Thus have we endeavoured to explain to
you, in some mcafure,-in what manner we
expended your money, entrufled to-us until
about the 18th inft. at which time an exam
ination of our funds took place, and the bal
ance found tÂ» be but two thousand dollars
After making appropriations for the pur
chafa of five hunffvd cords of wood, and
fifteen hundred bushels of potatoes, for the
purpose of meeting the distresses of the poor
in the more inclement season.
At this time we were called on by an asÂ«.
fociation of young women of great refpefla
bility and known philanthrophy, who have
been for several winters employed in reliev
ing without partiality the fuffering poor par
ticularly of their own sex ; paying no re
gard to distance weather or fittrution ; not
doubting but it would meet with your ap
prohation, nnd be as agreeable to you to be
informed of their praife-.worthy request, as
it was to us by having it in our power to
grant them five hundred, dollars and ten bar
rels of flour, at a time when we had con
cluded to suspend the supplies as eur fellow
citizens had returned home and emplovmcot 1
w-a attainable ; yet there might be nume- il ;
rou3 cases wheivin this worthy female focie- v:
ty unight indulge themselves- iff visiting the 1 1
mam'ior.s of distress and thereby give relief' i
to many vyliofe sitUations would never have ' .
oeen otherwise known' j (
Although we have the above balance.be- '.
ides wood, portoes, and flour, we fear it , 1
will be scarcely fuScient to meet the nume- j 1
*ous wants of the inhabitants during the ap"- | '
pror.ching winter. j s

for from Paris for an important expedition,

talâand that it may not be said the a/rival
of these dangerous men is the mere effeft of
chance, it is of importance to make known
to Francetbecircumftance of thisaffemblage.
" The fame invitations to come to Paris
hare been sent at one and rite fame time to
every part of the republic, and to known
terrorists. The jacobins flatter themselves
with a speedy explosion, with an attack a

letter to the Editoc of the Memorial,
" The following is what I have just learnt,
and I haftcn to communicate it to you.â
The direilory, or rather the direftorial tri
umvirate, project a terrible blow, the execu
tion or which would complete the ruin of
our unfortunate country : We mud hasten .
to announce in order to avert it. Irt about
four or five days the jacobins in their pay
will be sent to the houses of the energetic
deputies of the new third, and will surround
them, to prevent their going out and repair
ing to the councils. The direflory will
address a message announcing a royalist coii
fpiraey, difcoyered during the night ; and
among the authors and accomplices will
name all the deputies whose talents* virtue
and ( are fp. great an obstacle to the
perfioy ofjheir iibwticidal designs. They,
will demand their trial before the high court.
All the isoturtjgineers will rceelye, with a
transport of rage, the denunciation. A
great part of the Ventre (the belly) will
join them. The decree will be carried, and
the acciiTed will soon be sent un
der a ftrtng escort to Veudome, and the
reign ofjerror wilj J,e re-eftabliflied. The
confpiraey will be founded upon pretended \
papers, to have been found in the
Portefeuilhr of M. d'Entraigues, or some ;
other ; and the names of all th# deputies to
be destroyed will be inserted in it.
"There are in Paris 400 1 men dressed
like citizens, who are not so : The terro
rists abound at Paris ; and in a few days
there will be a movement.
" Among the warnings which the mem
bers of the legislative body are
receiving, the following expression has been
remarked : The dyke of the legislative bo
dy is behind them ; if they have the mif
fortune to retreat, they will fall in ie, and be
forever loft. It is said that the diredtory
had a stormy Itting last night ; that the
triumvirate persist in their fatal designs
I he tempi ft, and the fearful calm that pre
cedes it, infufes horror and dread into the
hearts of all.â (By a deputy, in the memorial.)
"Itis no longer polfible to doubt. Not.
only does a confpiraey exist, but it is carry
ing into execution. Paris is enveloped at a
distance beyond the constitutional circle.,
The danger is imminent, The National Re
presentation is on the point of being struck
at. Men who are to be affaflinated are men
tioned by name : the places of abode of the 1
Deputies are known. For some time men 1
have been sent into the Tribunes and envi- ]

or the'eoniffiifiion of infpeftors. It is not 1

are introduced daily into Paris, and the I

â n On Saturday at one, the Lord MayÂ»r, the
es Sheriffs, and several Aldermen, attended by
a- the city officers, proceeded from the man
re. fion house in state to open the fair. His
b- lordship flopped at Newgate, where Mr.
t, Kieby prefeiited him with the annual cold
a- tankard, which, it was observed, had much
better have been warm ( for the weather was,
for the season, extremely cold and wet.

tering of harmony having ceased, the annu
i- al fun, feftivity, humour, blatkguardifm,

as began. It being, unluckily,on a Saturday,
n 1 the Saint Monday's boys were disappointed
it âthe fair was much crotided notwithftand
y ing the weather. Tlte Scaramouches with
ic cracked trumpets, crazy horns, hurdy-gur
d dies, and broken winded organs, made a
r- moll glorious concert, which, by way of
11 the thorough bafa, was-filled up with the
1- roaring of lioiis, the squalling of birds, and
d the eternal bawling of " Walk in, Gentle
-11 men and Indies, waik in." The booths

d the Borough Mint, were there in great plen
-- ty. Saturday being their holiday and Sun

! WPDNESDAY NOVEMBER 29.
n Mr. Coit observed that the memorial of
y Robert Rutheford complaining of an undue
a eleftion, was before the committee of elec
tions at the last session, but no report was
y made upon it. He moved, therefore, that
e it be now referred to the present commit-
D tee of elections Agreed.
e Mr. Sewall preferred the petition Â»f Ro
bert Cooper, of Marblehead, merchant, stat
s ing, tint owing to some mii'cake in obtain
- ing the certificates to authorize him to the
drawback upon a quantity of wine imported
fro.n Madeira, he had been prevented from
- receiving the usual allowance on its expor
tation. He prays for redrefsâReferred to
the committee of commerce and manufac
tures.
" Mr. Hajper moved far the order of the
day on his resolution regulating the mode of
taking evidence in cases of conteiled elec
tions ; But, upon Mr. Coi't's wishing the
comjderation to lie over till' to-morrow he
corfented. '
I.ir. Lyon said, when the motion was
proposed yeftcrday on the fuhje<Â£t of wait
ing upon the FreSdent, he fhou!d have op
posed it, only that he did not wish to de
prive some gentlemen of the gratification of
attending the ceremony ; and now hi hop
ed those gentlemen would consent to grati
fy him, by agreeing to a ftfnilar resolution
to that of last session, excusing him from an
attendance upon the bulinefa.
: Mr. Sitgreaves said, that not with Itandinw
r the precedent of lafl session, he should be
- opposed to indulging the gentleman from
i Vtrm#nt in his request. When a resolu
tion palled that hcufe.it was entitled to the
1 obedience of all the members ; and except
1 the gentleman could assign some better rea
, foil than he had,for the indulgence, he trust
ed he would not be excused from comply
ing with the order.
Mr. Lyan hoped he should be excused
, fro m.repe -ting the reasons which he had hit
, session given for his motion.' '
. Mr. Macon observed, that whether the
refutation wa3 agreed to or not, the gentle
. man might doubtlcfs remain behind if he
1 chose, as he had no idea that the houfc
could compel members to go about parad
-1 ing the flreets of Philadelphia. The gen
tleman might have confeientious scruples,
and if the ceremony were meant to be ref
peafnl to the President, members should at
tend it freely, or not at all. He should wish,
then ;ore, that gentlemen disinclined to thÂ«
service, would rjpt join in it.
Mr. Thatcher saw no reason for esrcufiiifc
the gentleman from Vermont from his du
ty for a few minutes. If he had business
and chose to ask leave for a few days, lie
doubted not it would be granted ; but
when he vvifhed to be excused fiom attend
ing upon a business of importance, he "tho't
very special reafona IliouJJ be given for thÂ«
indulgence.
Mr. Williams wiihed thegeritlenan would
withdraw his motion, as it wf u trifling with
t.ie resolutions of the hotife to excuse any
member from a compliance with tftem. He
hoped the gentleman would not pcrfevere
in his fihgulitrity, though it might fee the
wish of some of hiscoufiituents, against the
will of folaige a majority of the house.
â  ir. Otis hoped the [notion won't] not
prevaij. He prefumrd no gentleman ther*
was particularly anxious for the frciety of
the gentleman from Vermont on this jucca
fion. iJo doubt he would grace the prc
ceflian, but it would be fuflSciently long
without him, and if he chose to remain b;-
hind, he need be under no apprehensions of
being called to account for his conduit. It
was not becoming the dignity of the house
to pass the resolution in quettion. It ap
peared to him that the gentlsmpn was in full
health and fpiritr, and every way fit so/bu
siness; and as the houfc had rcfolved the
thing should be done, he had no idea of ad
mitting the protest of an individuafuppn
their journals jigainft the measure.
Mr. N. Smith knew the gentleman from
Vermont had obtained leave of absence, up
on a similar occasion last felfion ; but he be
lieved the motion past without consideration.
ft was ur.expedtedly made, and by some a*
uriexpef-edly carried. Whenever gentle
men gave a reafouable excuse for an absence
from the duties of the house, they were eon.
ftantly conferred to ; hut when a gentleman
came forward to ask for the indulgence,
without giving any retfna, exccj t telling
the house they had dcUdl\he fools, he could
not consent to his being excused. If the
gentleman wire unable to attend, if there
were any difficulty in the Way of his atten
dance, aside from the want ota difpofiti'oa
to do it, he should no* objeift to the indul
gence. Mr. S. said, he' could not
wf:h the gentleman frora N. Carolina, (M;~
Macon) that no gentleman was obliged to
attend upon this ceremony. For his part,
he always conlidered a minority as bÂ«u:id
by the vote of a majority, and the majority
had pafled a vote that the house should at
tend the Speaker in prelecting
not "hat A, B and C ihould do but that â¢
the House of Reprcfentay'ves fhonld attend ;
a-'.d he believcdit to be as mueh the duty of
every metr.ber to form a house for this
pore, as far any bth-.r. He believed, not.
rnh'hndmg, that ii' a*y gentleman remain
ed behind, he would not be called to account
for is co dud ; out he was of opinion, that
a mot on like the present ought to be con
sidered as an indignity offered to the house,
and they ought ro decline afting upon it
Being of this ogjiwos, he flionVd move the
previous qneft^p^
Mr. Gal'.stin.l.iid, he should be in f.vr
of the previous que If ion, hut nor fc, t' -
r.afon,-. aHigit-.d Uy tin mover of it : â¢ :
for thole offered by tl,'.- gentleman f,-. ;nNorth. Carina (Mr. Macon], viz. because
he did-not believe- there existed any powr
in that house to compel any member to wait
upon the President with the address ; there
fore it would be improper to grant an in
dulgence to a member from doing, what
there was no obligation upon him to do. p-}e
did net reco'lcft the words of the refaction
which had been agreed to. [The Spsaker,
repeated themâthey were, " that the
Speaker, attended by the House of Rep*-
fentatives, fhail wait npon~ the President,
&c.] This, Mr. O. said, inuft be tinder
flood in a qualified sense, as the House of
Representative had no existence out of those
walk. When the Speaker presented the
address, the house wa3 uot present ; they
could not debate, nor do any aft as a house ;
the address was, therefore, ftriftly fpcaking,
presented by the Speaker, followed by mem
bers of the House of Representatives ; as
he"did not conceive the house had any pow
er without the walls of the house. They
could, indeed, appoint committees to do
business out of doors, but could not call out
the members as a body. Upon this ground,
he was, therefore, in favour of the previous ;
question.
Mr. Lyon said, nndrrrtanding the matter j
in the light in ivhich it had been placed by
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, he would j
withdraw his motion.
The Speaker fnid the main question was
not now under debate, and could not be
withdrawn, until the previous question was :
difpoled of. He enquired if the mover were 'â¢
withdraw it.
Mr. Harper hoped not, He should vote |
" in favor of it, not for the by !
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, but that !
the house might express its sense of fuel) a
motion.
Mr. Venable enquired if there were no
way of getting rid of the previous question ?
The Speaker fti'd, he conceived nof.
Mr. Macon alked, whether it would not
he in order to commit, or poflpone it to a
day certain ?
Mr. Thatcher thought he had known in
flanco6 where the previous question had been
called for, and not taken.
The Speaker replied, then it mult have
been withdrawn.
The previous question waÂ« then put in
! these words, " Shall the main question now
be put r" and it wascarried unanimously, No.
Mr. Livingfton from the committee of
commerce and manufactures, presented a rc
folution to the -following effeft :
" Resolved, that all memorials and petitions,
which during the second f'fion of the qlh Con
gress were referred to the Committee of Com
merce and Manufactures, and not reported up
on, be and the fame are hereby referred to tie
said Committee, for their eonfideration and
report,"âAgreed.
The Speaker announced the hour to be
arrived, which the President of the' United
States had appointed to receive the address
of the house in answer to his speech, and
the Speaker, attended by the members ac
cordingly waited upon the President, at his i
house, with the address, aijd the answer,
(for which fee the Gazette of the United
States, of Tutfday and Wednesday.) 1
The address being presented and the an- <
fwer received, the Speaker and members re- I
turned to the house, the Speaker as usual, i
read the answer of the rrefideut from thf| i<
,chair : after wh'ch,
Mr. Harper said, it had been usual, where <
legislative nieafures were recommended in
the fpcech of the President of the United j
States, to refer such pai ts to felcft commit- I
tees. He therefore moved, that the house
refolvc itfelf into a committee of the whole i
on the state of the union, in order to take I
into eonfideration the speech of the Presi
dent. 1
The Speaker said, the fptÂ£ch had not yet
been committed to that committee. <
Mr. Harper moved that it be so commit- <
ted ; whiph being agreed to, he moved that
the house now resolve itfelf into a committee ]
of the whob on the state of the union; i
which was done accordingly, Mr. Dent in i
the chair.
Mr. Harper then proposed fix refolutiorfs 1
for adoption, to the following effeft ; which <
he pfcipofed to be referred to feleft com- 1
mittee*. '
1. Refolded, That so much of the speech of
the President of the United States as relates to I
power being given to the President to poflpone I
the meeting of Congress, in certain cases, be re- <
ferred to a felt '.CI committee, to report by bill or I
other wife." <
2. That so much as relates to the protection
of commerce, be referred, Isfc." _ I
3. " That so much as relates to the attempts
of foreign agents to alienate the afftdions of the t
Indian nations, and to excite them to actual hof- (
tilities agaihjl the UnittdStates,be referred,&Â£." 1
4. " That so much as relates to a provif.cn
for the fulfilment of the 6tb article of the treaty 1
between the United States end Great Britain, t
be referred, oc. 1
5. " That fq much as relates, to the reim
hurfement of certain advances made by the con- 1
fds of the United States, be referred, &f." .
6. " That so much as relates to the revision, c
and amendment, in certain particulars, of the
act relative to consuls, be referred, Sec." <
The two firft refolutioss were agreed to t
without objections. On reading the 3d. 1
Mr. Nicholas said, he did not think they (
were ripe for going into this business. It 1
was usual, when the President alluded to <
fa ft 5 in his speech, whSfh he proposed in* 1
the course of the fefiion, to give further in- t
formation upon, to wait for that informati- 1
on before they proceeded to aft upon them. 1
He thought thi3 would be bell fn the pre- f
feut cafe. '
Mr. Harper did not recolleft that the 1
President referred to any particular dricu- ! f
mentis on this fubjeft. If a committee were i t
appointed, they would of course enquire t
into the fafts, and report accordingly. 1
Mr. Nicholas said, the mover hi.nfelf t
feenud to be aware that the committee f
would be at a loft for facts,, and that they 1
would have to apply to the President for 2
them. He thought it would be more re- t
fpeftful to wait, for the communications
r which would of ooiiVfi h â  mad-to tke House
l t.ian to employ d eoraniittee to make the
- enquiry.
Mr. Harper said the President had told
t them, as a faCt, that such attempts had
' been made. [Mr. H. read an extract from
1 toe speech.] 1 o poftpooe the appointment
r of a committee, therefore, in order to wait
; lor further communications, would be tofay
- they did not believe the fad, Before ; the
, President had made the assertion, he would
- doubtless be well allured of the truth of it.
F But he would observe, that if np such at
tempts had been made, they were not un
likely to be mad?, and. the law recommend
ed 011 that ground, was very dsliruble. It
was well known that the ordinary course of
law will not go into that territory ; there
must be a diltinft and particular legislative !
power for the purpose. Admitting, thera
fore that the President has been mifin
formed, the law could do no harm, but
might prevent the evils complained of,
Mr. Sitgreaves observed, t"hat the gentle
man from Virginia, (Mr. Nicholas) was
"try correCt in faying, that it was usual to
j wait for the promifiid communications of the
; Executive Department, before they pro
ceeded to act upon any business recomrnend
; cd by the fpeeah ; but it must alio be recol
lected, that the stile of this refutation was
different from that heretofore used. It was
cu'tomary to fay, on these occ.ifions, " Re
â  solved, that it is expedient to do so and so,"
j which they could not do, until evidence was
j before them; but this committee being dif
ferently formed, there was not that neceffi
. ty, and when the communication was made, â 
i it would of course be referred to the com
mute now proposed to bÂ« appointed.
Mr. Dayton (;at Speaker) said, that the
law recommended by thj: President of the
United States to be pr.ffid, was to give bet
ter effeCt to th? nieafures already taken to j
counteract the attempts of foreign agents i
upon the Indian nations. Before a, law j
could be passed to give effeft to those mea- '
fures, it was was necessary, therefore, they j
should be laid before them; and, if a com
mittee were now appointed, they would of)
course have to look back to the House for '
information.
Mr. Baldwin thought there was Another
reafonfordeferringthe business. He thought
there was a law intimately connected with
this fubjeft which expired in the spring (of
which they should have notice from the com
jnittee of revifal if it was so") and of which
this provifiatt might make a part. He saw
no inconvenience which could arise from let
ting this fubjeft lie over for a time.
Mr. Macon said, if the gentleman from
S.,Carelina wouldconfent to let this matter
be pasted over, the House might proceed
upon thofc objects upon which there feemrd
little difference of opinion.
Mr. Brookes saw no impropriety in refer
ring the business to a feleft committee ; for,
if it were referred; it did not follow that
they were obliged immediately to aft upon
it. crime, ue laid, was identified
If the committee were appointed, and the
President had communications to make upon
the fubjeft, it would have a tendency to pro
cure more tarly information than might o
therwise be obtained. He thought this re
solution aÂ» proper fqr committment as any
,other.
The question for agreeing to the rcfoluti
-011 was put and carried, 44 to 3;.
The remainder of the resolutions were a
grced to, the committee reft, and the house
took thetn up.
The three firft resolutions were agreed to
in the House without debate. Oil the 4th
being read,
Mr. Sitgreaves said that this refolutica
ought to go to the committee of Ways and
Means, as coming direftly within their pro
vince ; but at present, he behVved, no such
committee had been appointed.
Mr. Harper thought it might with pro- 1
priety be referred to a feleft committee,-as
it embraced other objefts besides providing
money. 1
Mr. Venable was of opinion it would be
best to postpone this business to a d'rtant
day. He did not know that any decifiun
had yet taken place, and therefore there was
no neceflity for the resolution at present. <
Mr. Sitgreaves was not willing to agree
tÂ» a postponement to a distant day ; but
thought it would be best referrtd to the 1
committee of Ways and Means, as it was 1
ntceffary they should have the whole of the '
demands against the country before them. 1
He moved, therefore for a postponement to ]
this day two weeks.âAgreed.
The two remaining resolution Â»';eing agreed <
to, and the latter rf ferred to the committee 1
of the whole to whom was referred the afts j
relative to American seamen. 1
Mr. Sitgreaves observed, there was a <
very important matter in the Speech yet un- 1
touched. He therefore, proposed the sol- 1
lowing resolution ; ?
" Resolved, that so much of the Speech as 1
relates to Foreign vefjels failing under forged >
/fmerican papers, be referred to the Committee t
of Commerce and ManufaÃures â â Â»
Mr. Livingfton moved for the order of the i
day on the report of the committee appoint- I
ed to enquire into the operation of the aft t
for the relief and protection of American i
feaupn ; whiqh being agreed to, the house/
resolved itfelf into a committee of the whole *
and the report having been read, three refo- a
lutions were agreed to, viz. one dire&ing f
the Secretary of State to lay before the f
house an abftraft of all the returns made to t
hitji by the Colleftors of the several ports, r
and such accounts as Jie may have received i
from our agents in foreign ports ; another I
for allowing cents per day to every c
sick seaman in a foreign porf, and a funi for i
their traimportation home ; and another <H- r
resting that a cevrain deduction (hall be
made from the tvages of the seamen, for c
the maintaing of the sick and ditabled, and f
for the support of an hoipital. The house 1
having concurred' in theie resolutions, and t
appointed a committee for carrying them in- t
to effect, . f

' i that on the 2 l ft of the month, an injunction
â  was granted hy the diftri& court to stop the
file altogether, as contrary to the treaty
concluded with Great Britain ; that the
said fJtip Amity being in a very leaky condi
tion, they obtained permiiÂ«ioN'from the eol
--le6tor to land the cargo ; that by a survey
afterwards held on the (hip, (lie was con
demned as not sea worthy. In consequence
application was made at the custom house,
i for leave to re-export the cargo in neutral
j bottoms, as French property, which per
j million was at firft refufed, but afterwards
granted ; but that in the mean time, by
the fire which laid waste a greit part of
Cnarleftoa, the 13th of June last, J2 hog
sheads and 3 tierces of ftigar were totally
consumed ; wefeupon, the colledtor order
the rum, part of the cargo of the ship Aa
-1 ity, to be fold to secure the duties on
j the sugar thus consumed by fire. The peti
j tioners pray for relief by a restoration 01 th'e j
i duties thus collected from them,
j The committee of commerce aifd manu
j .ft&uveÃ are of opinion, that this cafe mull
i be considered as one for which 110 prohiion
i had been made by law, but as analogous to
that of wreck; that the cargo was supposed
be landed only in coiffequence of the al
! le IgpS disability of th* thip, and that as no
. sale of the cargo could be made, within the
; United States, no duties ever could have
! been codcftcdiVofliif ;Â£u as the deftruftion
of the sugar by fire, nothaviiig altered the
original ground on whicj) they were fuffered
to be landed: to wit, merely in tranfitu, un
til the (hip could be repaired or the goods
re-exported, the duties ought to be refund
ed. Whereupon they recommended to the
House to adopt the following resolution;
" Resolved, That, a committee be ap
pointed to bring in a bill to grant relief to
the petitioners, according to the prayer of
their petition."
The above refÂ»lntion was agreed to with
a trifling alteration. 1 The house took it up,
agreed to it, and appointed a committee to
bring in a bill.
Mr. Dent, on apjflfcation, was cxcuCed
from serving on the committee of commerce
and ir.anufa&ures (being'already upon two
other eommittees) and Mr, S. Smith was
appointed in his place.
On motion of Mr. Otis, the petition of
Wm. White was referred to the committee
of commerce and manufaftures.

' ' â¢- â¢ ' ' 1 ' "
Extrafl from 'the Charge of Chief Juflice
Ai'Ktan, to the Grand Jury, Nov. 27.
" Before I conclude, I Am sorry to have
oCcasion to mention, that there is another
crime, that peculiarly concerns the judges
of the supreme court to endeavor to correct,
it i 3 thafof Libelling. I will describe it
at large.
Libels or /iScllifviufi, taken in the mo 2
extensive sense, fignify aqy writings, pic
tured, or the like, of an immoral or illegal
tendency; bbr in the sense we are now to
consider them, are malicious defamations of
any person, and especially of a magistrate,
made public either by writings printing,
signs, or pictures, in order to provoke him to
wr.tth, or to expose him to public hatred,
contempt or ridicule.
The direct tendency of these libels is the
breach of the public peace, by stirring up
the objvrts of tbem, theirfamiliesand friends
to aftsof revenge, and perhaps ofbloodfhed;
which it would jÂ»e inipoflible toVellrain by
the severest laws, were there no redress from
publie justice for injuries of this kind,
which, of all others, are mod sensibly felt ; i
and which, being entered upon with cool- 1
ness and deliberation receive a greater aj- ;
gravation than any other scandal or defa- !
mation, continue longer, and are propagat- 1
ed wider nnd farther. And where libels are 1
printed against persons employed in a pub
lic capacity, they receive an aggravation, <
as they tend to scandalize the government, 1
by reflecting on those who are entrusted
with the admitiiftration of public affairs, and 1
thereby not only endanger the public peace, 1
as all others do, by stirring up the parties* 1
immediately concerned to a6ts of revenge, t
but have also adiredt tendency to breed in f
the people a Miflike of they- governors, and '
incline them to'faÂ£tiÂ«n fedition. c
Not only charges of a heinous n'atfire, and ;
which reflf.d\ a moral turpitude bn the party, '*
are libellous, but also such is'fet ISrn in a t
fcurrilotis ignominious light : per- 1
son desires to appear agreeable in life, and *
mult be highly provoked by such ridiculous <
representations of him, as tend to leflen him c
in the eftecm of the world, and takeaway 1
his ieputat'oll, which to fame mea is more {
dear than life Kfrlf, fer these equally create e
ill-bh>od, and provoke the parties to aÂ£U of j
revenge, and breaches of the peace. c
A defamatory writing exprefiing only one t
or two letters of a name, oc-tifing such de- t
fcriptions and ciicumlocutions, feigned t
names or circumftanees, in such a manner,
that from what goes before, and follows as- \
ter, it must needs be understood to fignify f
such a perfoa in the plain, obvious and aat- \
liwfc'coa'Truism fthc'w'iol.', wm"j: -oper
â¢!'' a Ms!, aj-ff C-J w!i,;i

'tVPt upon the law. to fufftr it's justice
eluded by Tuch tr.nirig tvafions; and
it irn ri-itcu]->HS a'&furdity to fay, tiiat a
e writing, which is, understood hy every the
. meanÂ«;ft capacity, cr.vno-t pofflbly be undir
s (Isod by the cnijr!s and juries.â¢
It is equally ridiculous and ebuird to fup
> pose that if a man speaks (landerous or d--
, famatdf-y words of another, he may be sued,
r and ample damages recovered for the injury,
1 | but if the fame wofdov.re put in wrfting r,j
, i printed, no pusilhment can be inflicted,
f Such a dcÂ»<strine may gratify the wi'hes of
> envjous and malicious towards and aiTafiins,
' but must be detelted by allftnlible and good
; men.
I _ These offence? are pnniliable either hy
' indictment, ir.Toi rnation or civil action : but
there are some instances where they can be
punished by -\ erin:r.al prifccution only; as
the United States 111 congress aflcm
blecT, the legiHature, judges oÃthe supreme
court, or civil magifirates in general â  are
charged with corruption, moral turpitude,
b.ife partiality, and the like, wlien no one in
particular is named.
15y the law of the twelve tables at Rome,
libels which affeCted the reputatiou of ano
ther, were made capital offences but before
the reign ..of Augustus, tht punishment be
came corporeal only. Under the Emperor
V alentinian, it was again made capital, not
only to write, but to publish, or even to o
mit deftroyiffg them. But by the laws of
Penpfylvania, the authors, printers, and
pjiblifliers of a I,'bel are punishable by fine,
, and also a limitted iinprifonment at hard la
j bour and lolitary confinement in ,ga >l, ot>
1 imprisonment or one of them, as to
the court in difcretian fliall seem proper, ac
cordiug to the heinoufnefs of the crime, and
the qualityand circumftanees of the offender.
Any libeller, or person even speaking
words of contempt against an inferior magis
trate, as a justice of the peace or mayor
personally, ,'Jju' he be not then in the adual
execution of hit office, or of an inferior offiser
or Jukice, as a constable and such like, be
ing in the attual execution of his office, may
be bound to his good behaviour by a Gngle
justice of the pejee.
By jhis law and these pvinifhmerits, the
liberty of the press (a phrase much used but
little understood) is by no means infringed
or violated. The liberty of the press is in
deed essential to the mature of a free state ;
but this consists irt laying 110 previoas re-
Itraints upon publications, and not in free
dom from censure fc;r criminal matter, when
publilhed. Every freeman has an undoubt
ed right to lay what sentiments he pleases
before the public ; tÂ® forbid this, is to de
stroy the freedom of the press ; but if he
publishes what is improper, mischievous cr
illegal, he must take the tonfequence of his
temerity. To punish dangerous or offenfive
writings which, when published, shall on a
fair and impartial trial be adjudged of a per
nicious tendency, is necefTaryforthe peace &
g#od order, of government and religion ;
the only (olid foundations of civil liberty.â
Thus the et>/7/ of individuals is still left fret,
the abuse only of that free-will is the objeft
of legal punifliment. OurprefTes in Penn
fvlvania are thm free. The commou law,
wi{h refpeit to this, is confirmed and eftaj)-
lifhed by the conflitution itfelf. By the 7th
feÂ£t. of declaration of the principles of a j
free government, kc. it is afccrtained, " that
the printing prcfTcs (hall be free to every '
person, who undertakes to examine the pro
ceedings of tit- Legidature, or any part of
government." Men, therefpre, have only
to take care in their publications, that they i
are decent, enndidend true; that they are for |
the purpose of reformation, and not of defa- i
mation; and that they have an eyefokly to 1
the public good. .Publications of this kind '
are not snly lawfal but laudable. But if
they aie'made tft gratify envy or malice, and j
contain personal invedtites, low fcurility, or
(landerous charges; they eart aafwer no!
good purpafes for tfie community, but on
the contrary, must destroy the very ends cf
society. Wete these to tfcape with impu
n y* youth would not be fafe in its innocence
nor venerab/t old age in it's <w'ifdom, gravity,
and virtue ? dignity andjlatien would become
a reproach; and the faireft and belt charac
ters, that this or any other country ever
produced, would be vilified and blasted, if
not ruined.
If anr person, whether in a public or pri
vate station, doej injury to an individual, or
to the society, ample ndrefs can be had by
having recourfc to the laws, and the proper
tribunals, where the parties can be heard
personally, or by counsel, the truth can be
fairly invetligated, and justice fully obtain
ed : so that there can be no neccffity nor
reason for ixcufing any one of public or pri
vate wrongs in pamphlets or newspapers, or
of appeals to the people, under feigned
names, or by anonymous fcrlbblers.
â¢Every one who has in him the sentiments
of either a christian or a gentleman, caanot
out be highly offended at the envenomed
fcurrihty that has raged in pamphlets and
news-papers, printed in Philadelphia for
several yÂ« ars past, insomuch, that libelling
has become a kind of national crime, and
diltiriguifhes us not only from ail the states ,
around us, but from the whole civilized
world. (Stir fatirc has been nothing but (
ribaldry and billingsgate : the conteit has .
beer, who coold call n: mes in the greatcft 'j
variety of phrases ; who could mangle the t
greatcft number of charafters ; or who could; r
excel in the magnitude or*virulence of their
lies. Hence the honpr of families has been
fhined ; the highest polls rendered cheap ,
and vile in tile fight oT ihe people, and the y
great eft fervj-es and virtue blasted. This 4
evil, so fcaiula'oMS to our g;>verrfnient, and [
detcftable in the eyes of all good men, tal s
alo id for redress. To cenf'jrt the licennauf
nfs is to maintain the liieity of the pref. (

!â¢ ; whatsoever, â¢
fj Imprt-fT d with the dutiji of my jlation,
, I have used some endeavours for checking
a these evil*, by binding over th; editor and
printer of one of them, licentious and "viru
'e!)t beyond all former example, to his good
t behaviour ; but he (lill perseveres inhisne
c l irious publications ; he has ransacked our
? language for terms of reproach and infrlt,
a:;d for the bafeit acejlfStions againlt every
Â° ruler and distinguished character in France
i and Spain, with whom we chance to have
> any intercourse, which it is scarce in nature
' to forgive ;in brief,.he braves his recogniz
ance and the laws. It is r.ow with you,
> geniiemen of the grand jury, to animadvert
- on his conduit ; without your aid it cannot
be correfted. The government that will
- not difconntenance, may be thought to a
dopt it, and be deemed jullly chargeable
' with all the confeqjiences.
Every nation ought to avoid giving any
; rc,l l offence to another. Some medals and
: dull jefb are mentioned and rep'uffented as a.
i ground or quarrel between the Englifil and
Dutch in 1672, a s;d like wife cajifid Lewis
the 14th to make an expedition *;ito the
Â» United Provinces ot t'n? Netherlands in the
â  fame year, and yearly ruined that Common
' wealth.
Vv e are sorry to find that our endtavouts
, in this way have not been attended with all
- the gcod effects that were txpedted from
them ; however we are determined to pur
sue the prevailing vice of the times with zeal
and indignation, that crimes may no longer
appear less odious for being fajbionallt, nor
the more secure from punifhsnent for being
: popular.
The criminal law of this state is so preg
nant with juflice, so agreeable to reason, so
â¢ full of equity and clemency, that even those
1 who itiffer by it cannot charge it with rigor.
It is so adapted to the common good as to
fuffy no foliy to go unpunished, that re
quires to be retrained ; and yet so tender
of the infirmities of human nature, and of
the wives and children of even the greatell
offenders, as to refufe no indulgence which
the fafety of the public will permit. It
gives the rulers no power but of doing good,
and deprives the people of no liberty but of
d#ing evil. We are now (tlynik God) ia
the peaceable and full enjoyment of ouriaws,
of the free admiuiftration ofjuftice, and in
complete pofleffion of religious, civil and
political liberty. May the Divine Go
vernor of the world continue those blessings
to iy, and impress it as a duty whieh we
owe to ourselves -who enjoy tfrtm ; and to
those virtuous men, who, under God, have
been inllrumental in procuriru; them ; and
to our pollerity who will cljinTat our hands
this noblest inheritance, to maintain and de
-1 fend them at every liazard of life and for
tune.
! YÂ° u may now, gentlemen, retire to your
tiflj deliberate with coolness, judge with
impartiality, anv decide with fortitude.
And may Godovei-rule and diredl all your
. proceedings to the furtherance of juftictt
j and happiness of the people."

Bi order of the Unite l States, a Light House
has Keen ere&cd attlie Clay Ponds, on Cape
Cod ; the lamps in which are to he (iglited on
the ifth inll. The light house is ere<Â£led on,
land elevated about 150 feet, which with the fi
le vatioti ot the Lantern makes the whole lieigfrth
200 feet above high water mark. Ia orderthat
this Light may be diftintruiftied from the 80/ ton
and other Lights en ourcoaft, an Eclipfer is e
reiled, which will around the Lamps
once in 80 fecotiils fo,that the light will be near
ly excluded'fram the eye of the approaching
mariner about thirty'ftcÂ«Hls, in one revoluti
on of the eclipfer. To render the benavolent
designs of Congref; as e.\tenfively ufeful as pof
lible, the Marine Society in Boston, by a hrge
Committee from their body, whole views have
been seconded by others, have taken such dil
tances and hearings as tliev thoigVt necessary ;
which obfervatioria giving light aad fafety are
added for the benefit of all iafereftedâand are
as follows
Vtflels outward brund, from Boston I.ight
houfe, and would with to fall in with Cape-Cod
the tourfeisE. S. E. distance 15 leagues, thence
3 leagues to the Light house. When up with
the L'ght-houfe and it bears S W 2 leagues dis
tance, you then â¢ steer S S E which will carry
yov. out of the south channel.
Vessels inward bound, and fall in with the
back of Cape-Cod, bring the Light to bear S W
a leagues distance, then you may steer YVNW
tor BofloO Light-House.
If you you would wilh to go into Cape Cod
harbor, you may keep the Ihore aboard about
a mile distant, where you will have 10 flthomj
water. Th|re it a bat lies off the back of the
Cape, about half a mHe from the (hore.
When up with Kace-point. which is very
bold, and about three leagues to theweftward Â«f
the Lifht-houfe, and maybe known by a num
ber of filh houfti on it, from I to 3 miles to
the fouthvard ot Race-point, is what is called
Herring Cove, where you may have good an
Â«horfng half a mile from the (hore, the wind
frohi E to N N E in 4 or even 3 fatluÂ»m water.
If bound into Cape Cod harbor, your course
from Race-point to Wood end, i< S S E 6 miles
distance, bring the light to bear E by N and
run for it about two miles, you will then he
clear of Wood endâthen you must steer N E
until the light bears E by Sâ then run N W
f#r the harbor, unffl you have from 4 103 i-Â»
fathoms water, where you have good anchor
ing, the Light then will bear Eby S i-a S5 or
6 miles distance.
In running from the Race point to Wood
Endâafter you pass the Black Land or Hum
â¢ mucka, you will come up with a lew fapdy
beach, which forms the harbor; extending Ue
twsen i and } iÂ»iles to Wood-end, which is
difficult to be distinguished in the nightâlt it
very boldâyou will have fathom water
within half a mile of the ihore.
In beating into Cape-Cod harbor, you must
keep the eastern Ihore aboard, until yau get in
to 5 fathom water. Stand no farther to the
westward than to bring the light to bear E by S
as there U a long spit of land runs aiffrom the
western Ihore, which being very bold, you will
have 11 fathom water within a flonee throw of
Store.
In cafe it blows so hard that you cannot beat
in the harbor, you will have good anchoring
without, from 10 to ij fathom water.
Vessels in Boston bay and would wilh to put
away for Cape Cod harbor, must endeavor to
fall in with the Race. If in the night, and you
cannot fee the land, you must bring the Light
to bear E by N and run for it until you have
foundings in 14. or 15 fathom water, then steer
north call until the 'light bears E by 6 then . un
in N W for the harbor.
At full and change, it ii high water cffÃace
