CAUTION.
s__â-
WHEREAS vJry hrge and heavy debts are justly
due and owing 'from messrs. Blair M'Clenachan and
Pairick Meore, of the city of Philadelphia, merchants,
trading under tbe firm of Blair M'Clittachot anc{ P.
Meore, and from Blair M'Clenachan in his separate
capacity ; to which, by the laws cf the find, airthe
joint as well as separate prdperty of the said Gentle
men, in, and ought ta be, liable. And whereat
it U clearly and fatisfietorily ascertained, that mr.
Blair M'Ckuatfwn, of the said firm, has conveyed
' away to mr. John H. Hhjlor,, his fon-in-liw, to hik
_ daughter,-wi'ifs M'Clenachan, and to his foil, Geargt
M'Clenachan, several large and valuable real eltates,
as well a* coufidcrable personal property, in the city
aud county of Philadelphia, in the cSunty Lancat
ter, in the county of New-Castle on Delaware, ind
)' elftwhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
d feat the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts.-â
This, is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whemfo
e ever, a gain It the purchase from the said grantees, or
'j either of them, of any portion of the said real or per
sonal property, as the most vigorous meal'ures will
without delay be taken to render the fame liable to
the just demands of the Creditors.
By qrder of the Creditors.

re Philadelphia, December 17th, 1796. joth.J
TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints, *
is, warning all persons against purchafmg from the
be grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal cftates he conveyed away to
w hit fon-in law and to his children was the result of .
a a deliberation had upon the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of plair M'CUna
ii chan individually. . It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust coitfidod in the fubferibers bj
" these creditors a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very statement of the fÂ»6t therefore must difÂ»
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
_ or vindi&ive.'' It originated in a desire to fectirc
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his juA debts. It was fan&ioned by the
'â¢ advice of council as a tneafure necefary to the fafjety
of the creditors. If the advertifament has been
vn injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiliable conduct, not to the fub
fctibers who have merely publilhed the truth in
â terms as mild as the fad* would admit, and who
mean to iriveftigate in a high court of justice the
;s. validity of thole purchase* of whieh Mt. M'Cle
nachan fa confidently speaks.
The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
_ of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their'
caution against purchasing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it ta a
:lr purchase from any other persons (if Â£uch there be)
" to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may hare made similar
le conveyances.

Continuation of lit Jtbate on the addreft in onftaer '
to tbe PrtfiJent's fpertb.
Thorfdav, December 15*
Mr. Giles said the gentleman last lip had talked _
of improper language being; held an the difference
between the French republic and this country. The
fa&s he had mentioned, he Â£aid, were at we!' .
known to tlie French directory as to any gentle- (
man in that lioufe. He /poke of things a* they }
existed, Sfl3 ipeke of them with a to caution
the bou(e againfi war. Hewifhed thai gentleman
to look OcOO all the gloomy thiogs he had":{Â»id in
the last fcfSpn on the fubjeA of par. when. in his *
opininion, it much less prdtalJcjhan at pre
sent. With refped to tbe rarobabiliiy a rup- ,
tore with Franre. everyone knows that a tu/penfun j
of the powers Â£f the rainilter of that country had
taken place. This, !t had keen inlinuited, Jasto
hart an influence on a eertafii eleÂ£lion. TV's tras
tpo, improbable to be iqiagifed. He \rouid ask
gentlemen when tbey saw 21* thinguiÂ»thiicountry
wjiich placed us in so de'icate a lit nation at we were
at present with the French republic j for, from ,jhe
revocation of the Britifl) edict of the 6:h of No
vember, he never believed tbefe.was any probability
of Â» war with Great-Britaiaâ.Jjur, at prdfcjflt.Tk v
acknowledged he had very ferity appsaftenfrf s.
The jeutleman from MaffacKtifetts ?llÂ«ded
to certain information from Paris. If he supposed
there was other information than such as was
received from oee iniiividnzl to another, he believed
he was oiifirrfofmed. Mr. Giles said he had him- ?
felf lately leen a friend from that country w'Â»o Had 'Â«
given him information on affairs there. He did 1
not thii.k theie was any thing trcafunable in this. '
Much had been said about improper correspond- v
er.ee with France. He believed gentlemeu : '
of Ytich things until they fancied them real. There ! t(
might be persons, he owned, wicked enough to '
inflame the citizens of one country against another, j â¢']
hut tbefe could have little effefl, and he djfctlicved a
their eziftence at prelent. Such ideas were merely n
the fabrications of prejudiced minds, and it beiame P
ne?effary to fprak to them. . <3
Mr. KitchelKhought it was full time that gen- g
tlemen oÂ« both fides of th* present queflion Ihauld
hare exbaufted themselves. He though! too muUT t
had been said, and he wished the qucllion might t
be taken . , t
Mr. Sitgreaves agreed that a great deal of time t
had been spent in rlelefs difcufltons foreign from the Y
quell ion befyie them. He wofojd however fay a
few words to the jnotion before them. It was Sift (
thoved to tlrike put " freeft and most enlightened." t
It now moved that the passage (hoi:ld re>d, 3
" fftcft a;;d among the most enlightened " He t
though: the criticism in itfelf of like consequence ;
and he (hould not have troubled the committee with J
any lemarks on the fubjed, had he not heard one t
gentleman doubt ous being the most free, and ano- t
;i:ej tljai we ww Â«")i t ;)m.rrnL. i
liic i.et WaÂ«~cÂ»HcJirtfo giirftidti, he wilted"she "ex- j
preflion mfghl; not bÂ« (truck out or altered, bscaufc t
the dotug so, would countenance the idea that we c
were not free and enlightened. The light spoken ,
of, he laid, wis political light, and had" an refer- J
ence to arts, fcienee or literature, ano-in that sense i
he believed the affrrtiou to be founded. The pre- t
sent, he said, ought net to be considered as a pub- t
lie aft to be noticed by other nations, Wit at a com- (
pooication entirrly domeflicâas a cooverfation of j
individuals ; they fhonld be considered is speaking {
in soliloquy, and if another nation chance to over- l
hear them, it flioutd bj confiotreO as a kind of 1
Eaves dropping. ,
This fentirnent was Taluahle, he said; becaofe, |
to believe we are the frteft and ir.dft enlightened, (
would have a tendency to make us so ; an 3if we ,
were r,ot so, we ougbt to take fliame to ouifclves, |
since we have the power of making oiirfelres what i
wechufe. The belief was therefore valuable, and 1
if it ought to be cherished, it was proper auJ pÂ»a
dent to expref;; it. But to Jtidgeof the prt>prietv
of tiiis, or any other fentirawit, it ought not to be
considered in the ahftraft only, bat in its applies- ,
tion. The President of the United States, whose 1
administration had been so valuable to the people
of the United States was about to retij-e from his 1
station, and the honfe of reprefentalivea were go
ing to t>xprefs their approbation of bis fervic*.. ,
This approbation, said he, iV tbe <m!y reward he
can receive ; it oitght, therefore, to be made as ur. 1
equivocal and valuable at polfible. Now, wiÃ aÂ»y
One deny, he added, that the whole force of tbe
compliment is derived from our beiiijr free and en- ,
lightened; fÂ«r, if the acknowledgment wis not
iroro such a people, it would ceaf; to Be vatuaUK ,
The more Hrongly, therefore, tnu irnitiment could
he expressed, (be higher was i t vahje. â¢ (Mr. S.
read the passage.) Would any gentleman fay thit
the fpe&acle of a nation which was not free and
enlightened wouid either be " novel or iajtreflin;;?"
Hiftory.tellt us that such an expreflian would m-
r.ovel, Lptercflinef or valuable. Those,
therefore, who voted tot linking out these words,
Uiotaidir.ov- r 0 strike out the wljple He 1
was cpjiofed to all amendment of the original.
Mr. Thatcher said he did not think Â»he objeQ
before *hcm of <onfeqtunce. He wilhed to fee
tbe house unanimous on this fubjeft, and he would
propofr in amendment which he hosed might have
; the effrft to make them so. Hr move-1' to have
! passage read Â« the fpeftacle of a free and en
lightened nation."
Mr. Ciiriftie's motion was put and negatived.
Mr. Thatcher's was then put and carried.
Mr. Isivingfton moved to strike out the word
" tranquil prosperity," in tbe sixth paragraph. He
1 had two reason for thit motion. The Crftrefpefted
the fentkeent, the second the form of wording. â¢ He
could not eor.Gder the present period as a period of
tranquil profpmty j if he did, he {hould moek the
ailtreis ot his conrtiturntt, whoâ¢ he law greatly
. embarrassed ; but though he could not agree to that
. term, hr did not believe we were so mifrrabJe~aÂ»
â¢hole nations to which we were compared, and
-hetCiOre he thought the language of thcaddref.
might be ret s'oed.as far u U drew confbhtloi fr* n
thai view. The other objection which he hid to
the passage in qtteftion waÂ», to the wording of it
which indeed he ftiould not have thought of luff,,
ciant consequence alone to hate made hi*
had it not been conne&ed with the other objeftio*.
He believed it inaccurate to compare tranquil prefc
to period, Â»â¢ there waÂ« no fitrilarity between
them.âHe hoped thiÂ» amendment wouW takeplace
and that the addtef* would at length pift unani
anoufly. he expressed his gratitude to anl
admiration of the charafiei of the President, he
wifecd not to hurt hit feeliogs or pricciples, the
former, indeed, he might facrifice a little on the
occasion, but his principle* be rould not facritice to
aov man. 7
Thi* amendment wa* put and carried 42 to $7.
Mr. Lrvirgftnn moved to flr.ke out io the ntxt
paragraph, " wife, firm and pain'otic adminitfrsti.
an."* am! to iufert in their place, " wifdoÂ®, firm.
ness and pitriotiftn." Mr. L. said he did not be*
ljfve th'at all the a&Â» of the Pfefident's admioiflra
tion had been wife and firm, but he. would fay that
hi* wisdom, firmnef* and patriotism have beat fij.
nally conducive to the success of the ptcfeot form
of government. JJ
Mr. W. Smith thought the gentleman who made
this motion eonfidered the word* ohjefled trÂ»a* em
bracing rnjrethan they were intended to embrace.
They fignified no mqrc tbaa that bit administration
in jreneral- had been wife, firm and patriotic. Tfii*
did not embrace every aÂ£V. If she had not
bren in the address as reported, to hate omitted 4
therh would not have been of confequencc ; but
now they were there, to strike them out, would
convey cenfurf.
Mr. Giles said, it was well known that macy
gentlemen in that house had been particularly oppo
sed tithe British treaty, and to the emission ott.ie
quantity of transferable paper which had been emit,
ted. The gentleman last up had said, becacfe the
wird* were in the a. dress reported.they ought not
to be Arvck out. He did not think that commit
tee ought to be influenced by what had bee* repor
ted to them. The thing ft >od as if tbey had whol
ly to form the add reft. He acknowledged, if thf
amendment place it woutd make the thing
more palatable to him. He believed the PreGdent
pojTeffed taient*, virtue and wisdom, but thit tbefe
qualities had not becn-fo eminently difpU)ci in the
government as in the other ad* of Li* life.
Mr. Gilbert spoke agaiuft the motion. He
thought to feparatc the wisdom, virtue and patrio
tism Â«>f the President from tys public character, wa*
v to take away the force of the compliment intended
to be conveyed to him, a* it was his public, and not
hi* private character which they meant to approve.
Mr. Craik said the gentleman from
(Mr. GileÂ«) seemed tothirk it immaterial whether
thefubjeft wa* before a committee of the whole or
a feleÂ£t committee. The diltintfion was certaioly
material. What wa* done in a felcdt committee
was kuown only to themfelvej ; but what was done
in a committee of the whole wa* made public j a*
no gentleman could be at a lot's to know, that the
reported ad J reft, witty tly present delates, would
isc pnWifhed in all the paper*. The priuctpal rea
fen urged for fti iking out the exprefiiont in quef.
tion, bad been'grounded on the opinion that lame
of the acts of the Ptefident'a administration had
not been wife and firm. Much discussion had-la*
keo place. Some objeSrd lo'hrQf expi<oÂ°"Â»
account of the Britift treaty, .Â£><?<?-â #Â». account â rf
the emiflion of transferal paper. It therefore,
the amendment proofed was adapted, the o'-jettr
ons would be admitted to have forte, and that the
adoiiniilration of the President had not been wife,
firm and patriotic. And were there, he ulkcd, a
majority in that houfc who would fapport thra opi
nion i Beftdes, as it had been juftjy observed by
the gentlercan lift :;p, the -compii.-Â«eri: intended tÂ»
1 be conveyed, fliotild cd to the public cha
. the or it would imply a tacit
reflection on !-ii administration. Qa thefe^round*,
> he fell, as hetrufted a majority of that botife would
!eel,'a dehre to expreis his opinion, in favour^of
! the wife, firm and patriotic administration of the
President.

Smith and the speaker) had observed, as the ap- 1
probation went to the administration in toto, it had notl
refpeft to n0 particular aft. Nor did he believe viz
the literal words would apply to the business of the Mr
late treaty ; (he read the words) the mod clear as i
' meaning of these words related to the present go- wifl

eefs" could apply to those parts of administration pro
only WMeh had time to be matured. He did not had
believe that at the present period it could be said con
that the tfeaty with Great-Britain had been fuenefs- the
ful, and therefore could not' be included, within fall
the meaning of the exprefiiou. Not meaning to Mr

polfiblc to keep ont of view anv contrariety of o occ

ceflary for members to axprefs their opinions, he ne- wo
w fliould abandon nis. He thought the President pol
had in feversl things done wronjr; but he did not Lr
charge him with any thing but miijudgment. When of
he was applied to last fefiion to give up certain pa- wii
pers relative to the negociation with Great-Britain, net
he believed he mifjtidged in withholding them t a!fo _ot,
in fending an envoy to Great Britain, and in the no
f whole of the British treaty. He had not changed Sn
his opinion on that fuhjeft, nor should he, until he to
&w reafan ft>r so doing. And was he, with these ob
opinions to faf tie approrri-ef ihÂ«Ce mÂ«Â»fures ! He pr.
was willing to fubfcr.be to the amendment proposed, ot!
end if the compliment was stretched farther, it th
would be bombast. He considered this motion as th
very material ; for if they pasTed the original, it aÂ«
would be condemning many of their former afte. th
He hoped therefore the amendment would obtain, w;
S Mr. Gallatin thought the words objected to were fei
conceived to mean no more than ihey really m
did mean, by gentlemen who fnpported the present th
motion ; nor could he conceive how the words firm- fe
ness and patriotism proposed to be infeited could it
apply tÂ® any thing but the public charter of the d<
President. On the firft view of the address, Mt. tti
Gallatin said he thought with the gentlemen from
New-York and Virginia, and it wrs not without tl
considerable hesitation, that he brought l.imfrlf to vi
agree to this part of rhe address. He found, how- a.
ever on fu.ther examination, that they did not go
so far as he at firft thought they did. Had they ai
approved of every measure ef the President of the o
United States, he [hould have voted against them ; ft
but, in the firft placÂ£, he would observe, that as his w
administration did not include legislative , io u
' that whatever evfTs had arisen from the funding or b
banking fyitems, were not to be charged to the Pre- r

PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE* Â«*SS
A very long and warm debate took place yes
terday in the house of representatives of this state,
on the answer reported by a committee of the F!
whale to the Governor's speech, occasioned princi-
pally hy a motion of Mrc Leib to amend the answer Rsti
by the introdoftion of a sentiment approving of
the conduct of the governor in reference to the late
election of elcftors, and another, expreiTmg con- VTPI7
cern that any misunderstanding should have taken
place betwixt the United States and the French wT
Republic, and exprefling a hope that the fame mo- Khoje
deration and desire for peace, which had aÂ£fualed Q )r âÂ»
the Executive of the Uuion in a late negotiation, Vcrm<
would influence it on the present occafien. This New
amendment, which was of considerable length, was! New
rea(J by Mr. Leib in his place, and handed to the ms
Speaker, who gavr ir to rhe clerk to read, when ,
Mr. Frazerand Mr. Wala objeaed VS
again read, as an unneccfTary wa(\r of time. The Kentii
Speaker said it was agreeable to the iuleÂ» of the T*nni
house that the motion (liould be read by the chair ; North
but that the house might, if they thought proper, South
dispense with the rule. The mover and Mr. SmU Geor J
lie complained of the fingularit-y of this procedure, r
acknowledging at the fame time the power as the 1
hoafe so difprqfe with the rule ( though they re- 1"J
probrated the principle) ; yet, as it had never
been done on any former occaHon, they trusted it Â« â¢
would not be done then. After considerable de- An in
bate, in the sourfe of which the yeas and nays
were called for, the question was takfn, and ne- Mi
gatived, there bring o.dy u for difpenling with Mr
the rule, and 53 ?gainft it. The motion was tlien H fnr >
read from the chair, and, without much debate,the Ef<l '
question was taken by yeas and nays, when there'
appeared 29 for admitting the amendment and 36 a re s,
>'â¢ . appoi
1 his amendment being loft, Mi. Leib moved a- faithl
nother, which was the latter part of the former, durir
viz that part which related tothe French Republic. Â«'Â«!
Mr. Smilie seconded this motion, and trusted that |
as it went no further than to express the earned T]
â  wish of'the house that thiscountry might be pre
served in peace, it would meet with unanintoirs ap us
i probation :he added, that, or former occaliuns it "j"|
had heeq insinuated that he . gentlemen who ware
! concurred with him in opinion, were for war (iho'
â  the aflertion was Uflfounded) but now, said he, w? Extr
1 tall upon to join ns in delires for peace.
> Mr. Fiazer and Mr. Wain, Ã¼bjeftcd to the motion, Â«
. on the ground tlm that house had nothing to do
, with the dispute between the two countries,
I which was in the hands in which.tbe conftittition j fre
had placed it, viz the executive of th* United
- States. TVe latter gemlcman said he had 110 ob- fXc j
- jeftion to echo thÂ« words of the governor, but did j,eu|
s not like the aixblification and the lugging in Â«n all t h e
occaCons treaty. Mr. CaJ Evans had j en
â¢ no objeiHion to exprefn a defiie for peace, won
- wonld do it in a different way ; he therefore pro- r f( . r
t posed a substitute for tiie motion offered hy Mr. vV ;,|
t Leib, which expiefTed' sorrow that the republic j arc
II of France should have taken offence at the jnII and our
- wife measures of our government to prefervs its Â«
, neutrality, and ti'vifting upon a fair representation jijj.
i ot the business, tliey would be convinced llte-e was CIC

d Smilie fubllitute (hould be ottcrerl j e . :
e to an ame'ndmeiit to the principle of whicll a. tingle tan
e objc<stion had not been raifÂ»d by the mow of the m() ,
e present amendment. These obferva*ionÂ« cslled f>rth s
I, others from Mr. Eva s, in which he denied that I
it the Ftench Republic had ever rendered ferviae to pj e
is this country that it was the French King who had
it aided us, and that the Republic wis indebttd to a p o
s. this country, for the\ feed of that Liberty wiiich w j
1. was now springing up io France. Mr. Smilie eb- ,
re served in answer that, whaievÂ«r other gentjemen
ly might feel, he felt a gratitude for the services of
rrt the French N a tion ; and that no one could be of- ( i Q 'j
n- fended with allusions made to the Briiifli treaty, as
Id it was wiflied only, that the moderation a.id
ie desire for pesce" should influence the Executive of
r. the United States now, as upon that occalion.
m The qneftion for a portponement of a decision on
lit the for the purpofc of infrodncing Mr. E
to vans's amendment, was taken by Yeas and Nsys,
)v- and carried 33 to 32.
so Tha debate then turned upon agreeing to the
ey adoption of Mr. Evai s'amendment ; in the coutfc ; m
he oT which the yeas and nays were again called lor. j >J|
1 ; Mr. Wain was very dffirous that Mr. Evans should
lis withdraw bis motion, as he did not wish the house r j c
so to iriteifer* with'a fubjfft which did not properly l,
or belong to them ; if, however, it was put, he (hould
re- vote for it, as lie was convinced the bell way of
preserving peace, was to fuppnrt our own go/ern- I rj|
ment against all foreign nations. Mr. Evans seem- ,j,
ed inclined to withdraw his motion ; but Mr. Smi- j m .
vi- lie, and some others, infilled that the yens and nays iso
nh having been called upon it, the mover had no longer
ue power over it. The fpenker declared this to be a- j
at- greedble to order, when Mr. Frazer, in order to jj R
jet rid of the business, called for the previous
ar- question. Accordingly thf qneftion was put in
ift, this formâShall the main queltion now be pi t ?
which was decided in the nigativeby one vote only, o j
pe- there beifig 32 member# against putting the main L
be question, and 31 in favor of it. v ;
ide Mi. Frazer then moved an amendment (which tf
it seemed he had unfuccefsfully movc4in a commit- t j,
ten tee of the whole) in a part of the answer which
had -eferenre to the late eleiSion, which was to
strike out the word nectflity and to insert in its
the place one of less strength, in order ,to make the ap
ted probation of the governor's condwft in that bufi
or- ness more equivocal ; indeed Mr. F. declared his
opinion that the governor had afled wrong upon
â ea- the occasion, and that he ought to have proclaimed
as the ele&ion at the time appointed by law. After
some observations from Mr. Smilie in defence of the
the answer as it flood, (it being the usual time of ad- 0
ght joornment) a motion was made and carried to ptÂ»ft- n
fore pone farther consideration of this motion till to- r
monow. ''
on- A resolution was received from the Senate re- i
bu- commending that the governor be requested to ifTue f
pre- a proclamation offering a teafonable reward for the r
hen apprhenfion of any persons guilty of attempting to a
set fire to this city, which was twiec read and a 1
