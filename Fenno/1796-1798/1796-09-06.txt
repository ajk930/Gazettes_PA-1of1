' A very valuable Merchant Mill, o;
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE ir
QUARRIES to be let. C(
I will rent ray merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po- P
towmac, for any term not less than seven, nor more than "
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. ' The
f ellt mill-house is 42 by 40 feet, three stories high, built with -
S V stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two
overlhot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery
r complete, with every other thing proper and neceflary for
carrying on the business with dispatch, and at as little ex
pense as possible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my r
$ landing on the Potomac river, (where craft, of any bur
then may deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 0
yards, and from thence by water ti< George-Town and a
the City of Walhington, about 3 miles, and to Alexan- p
dria about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fulficient a!
capital, will command the produce of a very cxtenfive k
et. back country, where large quantities of wheat and other 0
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8 "
to 10 miles less than to any market town upon the navi-
gation of the Potowniac. There are on the premises a
U> be large stone Coopers'lh ap, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. A* the landing aforei'aid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for-
! '' 0' wardnefs and probably will be finiftied the ensuing fall.
1C 1C There are also on the premises, a Brewery and Diftille
a ' ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
~ or boilers, with every neceflary article, all new, and in
,S" good order, and fufficiently latge to carry on the Brew
nv ery and Distillery upon a very extensive plan. This prop
erty 1 will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my lands adjoining the premises, and along the
cum banks of the river, where craft inay load with ease and dif
:reby p atc h, is an inmenfe quantity of building and lounda
:o h' 6 tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
to more may be opened with ease : the stone taken from these
next quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
next " to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
separately or together as may best suit.
Q n t jj C to p 0 f the hill, and about 200 yards from the
IMN m ;i[ ) tt stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac- 1
commoda'tion of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke- (
house, &c. and a garden, enciofed and in cultivation, the 1
s old foi of which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I ,
' will also rent this property. 1
Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's 1
Clop, in which is a complete set of Blacksmith's tools, !
which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete
workman.
If I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were bnilt for the purpofc of carrying stone : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
nvas, pofleflion will be given, for terms apply to the fubferib
er in this town.
D. The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurten
Â§ ances, will be deliverad to the tenant or tenants in good
repair, and muftbe so returned, at the expiration of the
lease orleafes.

THE publisher thinks it a mark of refpeil, due to a
liberal and enlightened public, to inform them that
this is the Poem for tiie publilhing of which he has been
v twice dragged from his house, and is now laboring under
; a vexatious profecuticn. He is conscious that the piece
contains nothing either criminal or offenfive, unlets ori
ginal wit, decorated in elegant language, ba criminal or
dtfgufting to the prevalent talfe ; and, as he trusts that
neither of these is the cafe, he fubniits the work to th e
_ publit with a full assurance of its meeting with a favora
â  ble reception. _
He would beg his prosecutors to call to mind (it they
have ever read it) the following apologue to a well known
romanccâ" A .young painter, indulging a vein of plea
santry, sketched a kind of Gonwrfatitn Piece, rtfpc&ing a
C " bear, :.n owl,' a monkey, and ah ass; and to renJef it
y ' more flriking, humouroui, and moral, dilKngiKffied eve
ry figure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was
J exhibited in the garb and attitude of an old,
', drunken soldier ; the owl perched upon the handle oÂ£ a
" co ffce-pot, with fpedtacles on his nose, seemed to contem
plate a newfpapcr; and the ass ornamented with a huge
tye-wig (which, however, could not conceal his long
ears) fat for his pi<slure to the monkey, who appeared
with the implements of painting. This 'whimfcal group
afforded some mirth, and met with general approbation,
until some mischievous wag hinted thfc whole was a lam
poon upon an old officer, a physician, and a member of
Parliament; an insinuation which was no feoner circulat
ed ed, than these people Vgan to be alarmed, and evun to
ay f a n C y themselves fignified by the several figures in the
y- piece. Ihe furious greup fell upon the'painter, who de
lr" clarcd that he had 110 design to give offence, or to cha
raileri?s particular pei Tons. Thev affirmed, th; rrfetnhlanct
bc vat too palpable to be overtooicd, âand their clamours being
l<;t overheard by the public, the Captain was a bear, the
Dofior an ass, and the Senator an owl, to their dying
day." I?.a similar fate should attond the persons who
will infill upon being the members of this groui, the
public will do the publisher. the justice to remember that
it is no fault of his.

.'.J " WHAT think ye of the treety now?" This
de- question was asked by a writer irÂ» the Gazette of
reof the United States, and it seems to have roused the
wrath of the Aurora. A paragraphift in the latter,
def W '" 001 a " ow , * iat we are to { h'"k it a very great
matter to have the ports, because, (and is not this
and * vei 7 foolfh reason) we ought to have had them
;. long ago; TJiis argument, if it may be called ar
are gument, Ihews that we ought never to have had '
'â¢ them at all. 1
yet If the war party had ruled the road, we should 1
ted not ave them. They would have had no :
rn- treaty, how then could we have gained them ? By '
;to They said so, ani swore to it. According !
tne to their own story, therefore, (and its strange to '
find any fact accsiding to their story) we owe the 1
poflVflion of the pofis to the treaty.' This makes j
it proper to'pm the question, again and again, Ja- 1
toi'tns, -what think ye of the treaty now ? " 1
the The writer in the Aurora observes, by the by, 1
ted 'hat the British are guilty of of the trea- v
-i(st ty, because they held the polls SIX weeks after '
? ht the tirft of June, when they oughj to have been 1
' ng g l<ren up according to the treaty. Son of. confef- '
sli- 'here we catch you. The Aurora has filled
at mote than an hlindred columns to prove that the
na- treaty was not binding on our government, at lcaft 1
R - not upon the representative branch of it, 'till it l
was fashioned by Mr. Gallatin, Ms. Findley, Mr. f
Swanwick, and all other foreign patriots, who have *
come over to teach us what liberty is, and how to 1
:ed pronounce our mother tongue. The name of 1
>ks Get "S e Wafll ' n g ton . W4tl Â» the seal of the United Â°
hÂ« was a bauble that made the instrument nti
thei one thing nor the other, 'till the House had n
said it would do. Be it so, for a momentâThen h
_ pray, Mr. Inconsistency, was the treaty broken be- a
t cause it was Hot fulfilled before it was made ? It t>
was voted in the House on the 30th of April to
ily appropriate money to carry it into effect. It did l '
not Leeome a law, and appear in our gazettes for b
weeks after. Then to fend notice to Detroit wodld v
"g ,a k. e evera ' wc fk'. Then to fettle the manner of n
delivering of the polls would consume more time, p
et t ' l,s 18 a the treaty by the British ! it
L - Â»his accusation proves clearly that the new doc- Â»
trine of Mr. Gallatin, refpefting a ft are of the r<
treaty power for the representative branch, is no h
sd more believed in by one party than the other ; si
of otherwise they would not charge the British with
breaking the treaty, while it was their own song ft
that it was nothing, a mere dead letter, depending m
on their voice to call it into life. But who looks fc
_ for consistency from the anarchists. It is like ex- te
pe&ing giapes from thÂ»rns, or figs from thirties.
People addicted to a certain pradtice, should te
have good memories. When a law of Congress to
ie stands in the way of a treaty, said the Gallatin
â  e ' P ar, y> il is necefTary that it should be repealed by fit
d> Congress, otherwjfe the treaty cannot operate. So bi

s, . ver y â¢ en who vote(l in this way, voted for the th
e! treaty, although that treaty direAly an- da
j. nuls a law, and although Mr. Goodhue explicitly ve
y warned them of their inconsistency. After this, it ole
;e will be an up-hill draught to maintain that certain ty

; â  ing, two old houses in Houghton ftieet, Clare mar-
C- ket, occupied by several poor famines, fell down,
s and involved in their ruins the major part of their
d inhabitants. About four o'clock in the morning,
1, the watchman was alarmed by the falling of fevetal
1- panes of glass ffom the windows, and, on observa
tion, discovered chasms in both houses* He alarm
- ed the tenants of each ; but, through fotne unac
-1 countable apathy, they could not be prevailed upen
- to move. The landlord, a but'erman in the mar
ket, was applied to, who, in vain, warned them of
1 their danger. About half part eight , both houses
fell ; in one there were sixteen perlons, three in the
other : seven were, in the course of the day, diig
; out dead, Conic of them children, fuffocated, and
r nine aiive, but mifeiably bruised. A woman of
â  the name ps Moore, nearly 70 years of age, was
' heard in some of the lower parts crying (or affif
* ,anc e : her body was not found till about eight oil
- Saturday night, when life had left it. There are
1 two still among the rubbish, which the people are
cautious in removing, dreading they ftiall be buticd
by the fall of the adjoining houses.
In the evening while some workmen were era
ployed in propping the adjoining houses, part of
the wall fell in, and threw down the ladders upon
which they were Itanding. The men were so much
ruilcd by the fall* that they were carried to the
riofpital, in a dangerous state.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 17516. ,

By Capt. R. Mease, of the schooner .Lively, 15 days '
from Cape-Frsncois, we learn, that some days previ- 1
eufly-to hia fill. Ujt. the,jiniua.had taken polleiiion of
Monte Chrillo, by express invitation from the Spani- ,
aids, who sent to the Mole for fhs; purpose : This step, ,
however, was not deemed of any consequence at the 1
Cape, and certainly was very imprudent in the Spa- 1
niards, as by treaty their whole pofleffions are ceded '
to the $rench, in St. Domingo j and those concerned 1
in this affair will no doubt be made to fufl'er for their 1
temerity and folly. Since the sanitation of Etienne I
and Barraftall, two noted chiefs of the blacks, by the |
order of government, the negroes have burned l'eve- .
ral plantations near Port-de-Paix : 400 men from that ,
place, under Gen. Pageot, marched against them and '
forctd them to retreat to the mountains and ravines, '
where it was impofiibie for white men to follow them. '
jpj Perroud, one of the former-adminiftrators of Port-de-
Paix, is appointed minilter plenipotentiary from the
republic to the leeward neutral islands. and one Tfci
beaux is appointed in his place. Buftnefs of every
kind very dull at the Cape.
On his pafiage home, Capt. M. saw a (loop of war
on lhore upon the Weft Caicos, and supposed her to be
the La Serieufe French corvette of 20 eighteen
pounders, that failed from the Cape the day beforeâ
The violence of the gale-which blew at the time, pre
vented him from rendering any assistance. In lat. 3?,
30, long. 7j, saw three frigates standing to the S. W.
which he supposed to be > Barney's division.

From the COURIER. FRANC A IS.
A courier dispatched from Port San-Domingo reach
ed Cape-Francois on the 18th August, and brought in
telligence, thata French corvette just arrived at Sari- f
Domingo had announced, that the fleet of Don Sola- ]
110, which, united with'that of Richery is composed
of jalhipsof the line, may momently be expe<3ed,'
the corvette having been only a few days a head of the
fleet. J
The island of Dominica has been taken by Victor *
Hugues from the Englilh. j
_ Tortola, one of the Virgin Islands, has also been ta
ken, and 60 Englilh merchantmen were captured there t
by the Republicans.âThe island is entirely ruined.

Sketches of the Character of Buonaparte,
From a late Paris Paper.
June 3.
Buonarparte is of the age' of 27; By birth a
Corficanâbut educated in 1 France. He early en- 1
tered into the artillery lchool, in which his industry v
. and application soon procured him the rank of cap- Â£
;/ tain. Hisafpiring foul delighted no less intheftudy 1
, of HiÃory than of Mathematics and Tactics. He
is of a small Itature 3nd very thin-âhis countenance 1
paleâbut bold and warlike. He keeps his fang f
froid amidst the greatest dangers, and feeirs to be
entirely unacquainted with what is called fear.
"f hp' he be involved in fituatioi\s ever so trying and Â°
intiicate, it is not his nature to despair of success in
his enterprizes. He fsems to be in his element when
contending against obstacles and difficulties. Like
Jourdan and Pichegru, when in large circles, he is
serious and (ilent. In social circles he will enter in
to couyerfuion freely, and express himlelf wrth per
spicuity and precision. Literary, philosophical, fc
- and political conventions, pofkfs equal allurements b
for him. In a narrow, diminutive bad v, he bar- la
bouis an intrepid foul, a noble feeling heart, and a v e
mind exquilitely.cultivated. He is a dutiful son, a h<
warm friend, a' tender husband, and of course, a H
good citizen. *
