Sir,
I Finished my lad: address to you with a
Y>roni?f</ to furnifli you with extrafts from T!
Monro, ChiAioltn and Brice, in proof that
the Ttilcnv Fever originates from human ef
fluvia, And not from vegetable putrefaftion.
Dr. Monro, in his account of the dif
tnfeG which ucre prevalent it the military
Tiofpitals in Germany, from January, 1761). j of
to March, 1763, observes, that "in ajl jg!
who were very ill with the putrid th
from contagion, the countenance appeare|d fr
bloat rd, and the eyes reddilh and inflamed la
t lie fki'n commonly dry. By these fym|l- w
toms one might frequently discover that tHe m
natisnt. labeured ur.der a malignant fever." p<
!fage 40. is
" In toe continued fever from re
fays Dr. Clark, the Â«ountenance is much m
'altered, and dejefled. Early in the disease Ii
jtlie t ves become 'f<iffufed, an,d look as if , ti<
they -vcre iftjefted with a mixture of red ni
and veilowj" _ (Diseases of long voyages, tl
vol. i'. p. 257.)
Tft.it the yelloiii fever and the pestilential 1
fever fco(h originate from the fame cause,
appears evident from the journal ( of the T
French physicians, publilhed in 1770; and
also from Ruffel's Vlefcription of it at Alep
po. Red eyes, burning heat at stomach in ci
the early fhge, inceflant vomitings and yel- rr
lownefs cf the eyes and whole furface of ft
the bndv, are common to both diseases. t!
" I "was favored with the following ac-- 0
count, fays Dr. C. Chilholm, by Mr. J. v
Paiba, a gentleman who was one of the p
adventurers in the scheme for fettling a co- a
lony at Bulam in Africa, and whq, despair- t5
Sag of success, left that coast in the ship It
Hankey, commanded by cftpt. Coxe, and b
arrived at the port of St. George, in the 1 c
island of Grenada, on the 19th of Febru- d
aryj i,793Â» in a very diftrefled situation. f<
" This vefTel lay for a few days in the n
bay, but waÃ afterwards brought into the b
carenage; having only seven persons ort a
board, two of whom being very ill, were o
immediately carried on shore. g
" The Hankey had failed from e
in company with another /hip, both char-s a
tered by the Siera Leona. company, loaded t
with stores and adventures for the projeifted e
colony of Bulam, about the beginning of u
April, 1792. t
" At this island (which is about 45 n
miles in tfircumferende, and situated 11 deg. , t
N. almost in the mouth of Rio-Cirande, j r
enjoying all the advantages of the fea-1 r
brceize, and entirely exempt from marshy r
trafts) the Har.key lay nine months, dtar- I
ing which time the settlers, amounting to f
more than 2CO persons, were under the ne- I
cefiity of living on board. The rainy fen- 1
Ton coming on immediately after their art
rival, and the heat being at the fame, time 1
excefiively great, they endeavoured to (hel- <
ter themselves from both by railing the fides 1
of the (hip several feet, and covering her 1
with a wooden roof, <
In this situation a malignant "fever was <
generated, and destroyed three-foui ths of 1
all the unfortunate adventurers on board. 1
Captain Coxe finding the water brackish
and difagveeable at Bulam, proceeded with
his (hip to BifTaa, a Portuguese settlement,
for a supply. The (hip was navigated by ,
12 seamen who had not been on board that
fliip before. 'Nine of these died before the
return of the Hankey to Boulam ; and the
remainder, with the captain, were reduJfcd
to a deplorable condition.
When the time for which the Hankey had
been chartered was expired, (he put to sea
with Mr. Paiba, the captain, (who was sick
at the time) the mate and two mariners,
Which were all that could "be procured to
navigate her. They arrived, after much
difficulty, at St. Jago, where they met with
the Charon and Scorpion, (hips of war ;
from each of these they received two mari
ners ; and with this aid they proceeded to
the Weft-Indies, a voyage to England be
ing impra&icable in their condition. Three
days after leaving St. Jago, the men were
seized with fever. Two of th? four died ;
the remaining two were put on shore sick
as Won as the vefTel arrived at the port of
St. George, on the 19th of February, as
already mentioned.
The manner in which this diftafe was
firft communicated, and its subsequent pro
gress, too clearly evinced its malignant and
pestilential nature.
Captain Remington, an intimate acquaint
ance of captain Coxe, was the firft person
that visited the Hankey after her arrival in
St. George's Bay. He went on board in
the evening, and continued on board three
days ; be then proceeded in a coasting vefTel
to Greenville Bay, to his own ship the Ad
venture ; w ' as seized with a fever on the pas
sage, and diea three days after.
The mate, boatswain, and 4 Tailors, be
longing to the Defiance, went on board the
Hankey the day after her arrivalâwere all
seized loon after with the fever, and all, ex
cept the wiate, died i(i 3 days. The crew
of the ship Baillies, from the fame imprudent
civility or curkifity, were the next that fuf
fered* From these it gradually spread by
contagion to all the ships in the Carenage,
and destroyed more than 200 out of 500 sea
men, who were employed in the .regular
trade, from the beginning of March to the
end of May.
AWit the middle of April tne fever be
gan to appear on shore. ihe firft house it
made its appearance in was that of Meflrs.
Stowewood and Co. situated near the wharf;
and tY contagion was evidently introduced
by a Negro wench who took in sailors
cloaths toÂ°wafh. The whole of the family
were fucccffiveiy affected, and by them tl.e
fever was communicated to several of thelt mar
acquaintances, * '" ot
The manner in which it spread In the C 1 '
town, clearly 'dero.nftratcd its contagious
nature, and no jnflance occurred where it
could not be traced to communication with ,
the infe&ed. * j .
\ More than one-third of all the inhabi- â¢
Vdifeafe ceased, and about one in five <af all
I that were infeclcd died.

d vicinity
Permit us to address you at this awful '
n crisis, and to lay before you a brief state-
- ment of the diftrefling situation of our fuf- .
f fering fellow-citizens. It is known to you
. that on the firft day of September we ac
cepted of the appointment from the go-
vernor, to a& as commissioners for the pur- j
e pose of relieving the indigent, by donation
I- and employment, with the ftipulattd sum
rJ -of ten thousand dollars, granted by the
p legislature ; and We presume it was generally
d believed at that time to be more than fuffi-
d cient, arising from an expectation that the
1- disease would soon abate, and that our ah-
sent friends would return aad employ- a
e ment to those whose resources were cut off j.
e by their leaving the city ; but, ali\! how
it are We disappointed in our expectation, for
e our fcity yet continues in the fame desolated |
gloomy state, and consequently all means of j
employment for the inouftrious mechanic
and labeurer are still suspended. Add to
d j this the numerous body of females that pro-
d cured a livelihood by wafiiingj ironing, j'
)f needle work, &c. who are left de{litute of
their usual means of fabfiftence, besides a
5 number who are aged and infirm, that used
r. j to obtain relief from the bounty of their
Â», 1 more able friends and relations, as well as j
i- i many seamen's wives who depend on the
y merchant for part of their husband's month
r- ly pay, and who are now deprived of relief
0 from that source. Tn this deplorable fitua-
e- tion we found not less than three thousand
r- people, including children, when we under
r- took to execute the trust reposed in us : the f
number of these have since greatly iacreaf- (
;1- ed, and they still remain in the fatpe fuffer- j
es ing condition, with this difference, then
er thty had the consoling refleftion, that the
commiflionerj had ten thousand dollars rea- Â£
as dy to meet their exigencies, but now it is
of expended ; and lamentable for us to be (
obliged to inform them, " We know not j
fh where to fend you, or what to advise you
th to doâOur money is gone.*âWe have to (
it, acquaint you we cannot promise your fraall (
by pittance one week longerâwe feel for you â¢

h e tressâwhat can we do ?âWe can only pro- i
he mife you we will make your situation know* '

THE public attention has for some time
pad been dire'&ed to the praflice of physic,
and much personality has unfortunately been .
the consequence. A fubjeft which embraces
the iuterefts of society, in whfch
health even life are involved, can be viewed
with indifference by no-thinking being. It :
is not, however, front unqualified affection .
Or illiberal abuse, that we are to expe& in
formation : These may draw down upon
J.heir authors the well-earned contempt of
an ,'cnlightened public, -but can never affqft .
principles which must dftpend upon fafts "
ialone for their refutation tmd eftab'i'hment.
! The praftice of copious bhedirigin pefti-
lential diseases is by no means new, and the
janly reason why it appears so at present is,
.that diseases of this class, till very lately,
have been almost strangers among us. Di
emerbrock in Holland, Botallus in France,
and Sydenham in England, physicians of the J
lad dentury, whose medical abilities have
long received the grateful tribute of the
world, recommend this practice in terms of (
the strongest approbation and prove its utili
ty by numerous fafts.âThe life of mercury
in diseases of this class, with the iingle ex- j.
ception of- small pox, is probably more re- .
cent, but there is no physician in this city
who makes any pretension to the honor of
this valuable discovery; To have employed
remedies which the repeated experience of
others had proved to be beneficial, and which
were fanftioned by the most refpe&abl?
names in medecineÂ»,ar,d to persevere in their J
use after the cleared proofs of their efficacy,
is a merit which cannot with justice be de-
mVd to many of them. j
There is no way in which the public can j.
form a correft judgment of the fsfety and
ufefulnefji of these remedies, but by a candid
ftatemerit Of fafis. If every'phvfician would j
ftatt the numberxif patients he has attended
in the prevailing epidemic, the manner they j
have been treated, and the termination of
each cafe, whether favorable or otherwise ; /
there would then be a mals of evidence, from
which every unprejudiced mind might form
- a fatisfadfory conclusion. Till something
like this is done, disputes will be endless, j.
and the candid enquirer will find the fubjeft
I involved in impenetrable darkness. ImprefTed
. with the truth and importance of this obser
vation, I take the liberty of mentioning that
since the twenty-fourth of August last, I .
1 hnye been called to sixteen cases of the pre-
vailing fever. Three of these, viz. Ri hard (
p Davis, Neil M'Gongal, and Michael M'Far-
lan, were by my advice removed to the hof- j
j pital. Richard Davis I saw twice, and the
others once each, before removal. The re- j
mainiag thirteen continued under my care :
" they generally had comfortable apartments, |
and attentive nurses. Every one of these
p patients I bled more or less. From one I
ttook between sixty and seventy ounces at fix
j bleedings :of the others some were bled five (
and some four timesâ two but Jwice each,
and in one cafe, a lingle bleeding was fuffici
c ent. The bleedings were all performed on
the firft days of the disease, and immediate
ly afttr the firft bleeding in every cafe, I
11 began the use of mercury, both internally
and externally, with the intention of pro
' ducing salivation as soon as pofiible ; nor did
S I judge my patients fafejintil the mouth was
Â£ < eonfiderably afft&ed. Particular symptoms
; sometimes required attention, to relieve
U which various other remedies were originally
employed ; but to remove the disease I
trulted chiefly to bloodlettiug and mercury.
? By steadily purfning'this plan I have the
I fatisfa&ion to add that I have not loft a
X patient. Nine of the thirteen are now-well,
j and of the remainder, three are in a state of
convalefcence, and the state of the fourth is
aot yet decided, tho' I have reason to hope
a favorable termination.
I am vours, &c.

" DEAR SIR, us :
" We are truly sorry to find the fever are
hath broken out in your city. Do not run wi(
linto unnecessary danger. It rages here with the
violence, and too many die. For the
God's fake do not let your electors bleed
the pejple to death. If highly inflamed 1
citizens, let twelve ounces of blood be taken ral
immediately, give a(stive purges and sweats, lan
and cooling dilating drinks, and if pofiible Â° n<
keep up perspiration. ne j
" If the difvafe is obstinate, use plentiful lea
glisters, and keep the body ofien at all e- In
vents ; and in the last stages, flannels wet in ed
warm brandy, applied to the stomach and tuj
feet,, with bliftcrs on the ankles and wrists. ,
" The disease hath pafled through seven
famib'es, who are my tenants, and all have ck
recovered by this jreatment. Use no wine.i he

The information in yow last paper of an ai
infurrettion among the inhabitants at Nat
chez is not correft. It is at K.afka(kias,and in tl
the neighbourhood of that place that the p
French settlers have been instigated by Span- t
ifh and French emissaries to throw off their p
allegiance to the United States and ereft the (1
standard of the French Republic. General 1
Wilkinfon on his march with a strong de- 1;
tachment of Federal troops to fuppvefs the c
insurgents.âThese wicked French emissa
ries are also endeavouring to prefuade the c
Indians into another war with us), and a par- f
ty of the f ivages has actually attempted to f
get poffeflion of Fort Recovery but were <
defeated with the loss of two or three killed, r
It gives us great uneaiinefs to learn that i
three Frenchmen who passed through this 1
place some yeeks ago, have been addressing \
themselves to Cornplanter's Indians and tei- c
j ling them that they were oppressed by the c
United States and would never be happy t
till their old friends the French were in pof- <
' fefiionofthe country again. It is fi'id the In
diansliften tothefe speeches with grea'.atten- 1

Very Recent Foreign Advices.
Last evening arrived (hip Minerva, Gupt.

t fudge Tudor, who was passenger in this
u ihip, lVe were indulged with the loan of an
t Engliih paper of August twenty one, from
' which we make the following intercfting
Extrafts:
LONDON, August 15.
As on the one band the French Di're&ory
have violated the Constitution by their mil
â  itary-manoeuvre*, so on the other hand, the
T Legislative Body, in assuming to themselves
d, the right of establishing a Military Guard
ifi and of appointing the officers who arc to
-â  command it, seem to have entrenched on
4e the perogatives of the Executive power. â
U How far they may deem themselves juftified
ti- by. the necessity of the cafe, and on a prin
;n ciple of felf-defence, is another question.
But it is a neceflary consequence, that where
f " a Constitution is formed upcmab'lracf prin
'f ciples, without any attention to the state
ill of society, or any regard for experience, the
:c > boundaries of power will remain undefined,
m and perpetual contests and confufion ensue.

f c ' Many think the Peace between Portugal ;
re, and France, will accelerate Peace between
he us and the Republic. Having no allies to
att'end to, we may certainly hope for over
, tures, more according to the disposition and
hi, int,ercft of our government,
ug This' Peace appears extraordinary, ,as the
ch Court of Portugal, gave fervent assurances
s , ! of remaining with lis. It had not, howe
iu- vtr ' S ot 'he last fubfttiy of 200,00q1. about
of 70,000 only had been paid,
to- After a Cabinet meeting on the late dif
vc patches from Lille, reports were current,
:hc that favourable news had been received from
thence.
PARIS, August 12.
u( . It appears certain that 10,000 men from
,Vt the army of the Â§ambre and Meufe, who
were to have arrived at Rheims yeftcrday,are
going to Brest. Other detachments'Â»re re
pairing thither by other rouses. These
movements appear to announce the execu
tion of the long proj-fted maritime expedi
tion is at hand ; a circumstance wWich makes
us apprehensive thatthe negociations at Liflc
are not in such forward rtate as all France
wifhe3 them to be. In spite, however, of
these hostile appearances, we still preserve
the hope that peace is not far off.
August 13.
One mo/e step is made towards the gene
ral pacification ! One ally taken from Eng
land ; one branch of the coalition cut off;
one additional motive for believing that the
negociations at Lisle will be fuccefsful, or, at
lead, that their progress will be more rapid :
In (hort, a treaty of peace has been conclud
ed between the French republic and Por
tugal.
, This treaty appears to be very advanta
geous to France ; among many other arti
cle? relating to a trade of which France has
never yet partaken ; since (he is treated bet
ter than the moil favored nation ; since eve
j ry thing favors reciprocal imports, and {he
1 balance of all in favor of France, who drinks
: none of the wine of Eortuga!, while Portu
gal confunves a considerable quantity of
French wines ; since Portugal accords a di
minution of the duties on importation ; it
may be farther remarked, how much we are
favored in many other refpe&s.
The treaty obliges Portugal to admit no 1
more than fix ships of war into the port of
Lifbon,and in her smaller ports, only three
I ships of war, belonging to each of the beili
-1 gerent powers. It may be seen, that as
England has 110 allies who fend fliips into
those parts, this article is very advatitagetras
to France ; since fix French, fix Dutch, and
I fix Spanish (hips, my be at Li'bnm at the
i faree time, againft-fix Enjlifh. It is alfd
; known, that the Englidi have no otherhar
bonrs in those seas, France has those of
Spain.; thus it was of great consequence to
insert the article by which Poftugal engag
es to admit no pnzes taken by Ihips of war
or privateers, into her ports. They ever, go
so far as to prohibit the sale of mtrcandize
that is captured on board a (hijS.
Nothing can be more favortible and en
couraging to the national induflry than the
article which promises a kind of premium, an
extraordinary diminution *%Hty, in favor
of articles imported from Enrobe by eithet
of the contracting parties into the dominions
of the other, provid d the cargoes belong to
merchants of the nation that'ifnports, and
are imported in (hips of that nition.
We may fee by the secrecy with which
this negociation was conducted, and the rt- '
pidity with whiqh it was concluded, that
the spirit which so abruptly broke off the
preceding negociation no longer prefMes
: over our diplomatic system. It was certain
-1 ly fortunate and Ikilful, thus t<9 leave Eng
- land, to herfelf, and cut off the last branches
: of f!:e coalition. (JJEclair.)
According to Perlet, the treaty consists
; of 8 articles, which Ripulate for the excln
- fion of all of all privateers and their prizes
) from the ports of Portugal ; for a cession
; of a part of the Portuguese teriafory in A
. 'merica to the French ; for a commercial
intercourse between thf two con otries, high
-5 ly advantageous to the republic j and a pri
Â» vate article, it is said, for the payment of 10'
- or 12 millions of livres to Francei Nothing
; official appears in the prints on the fubjeft, '
f though the treaty has been read in the coun
cil of five hundred.
The French journalists argu.t. from the
- rapid manner in which this treaity has been
- concluded, a speedy issue to ihe negocia
s tions at Lisle and Udine. Wii are not. fur
-0 nifhed, through their channel, tvith anv in
n formation"from either place, which can lead
to a conjecture on the iubjedt.

Jercmie, April 30, 1797.
Sir,
The republican general Riga-id, thinking
the moment favourable to made a second at
tempt on Irois, collected his very bed troops
to the amount of 1200 men : On the night
of the 20th of April, at twelve o'clock,
they attempted to dorm the fort, ia which
â was oftly at' the time five and twenty of the
17thjnfantry, with their officers, command
ed by lieutenant Talbot, of the 82d regi
ment, and about twenty colonial artillery
men commanded by captain Brueil. The
attack was one of the mod formidable and
determined I ever heard of; they returned
to the charge three several times with such
increased vigor, that many of them were
killed in the fort ; but, to the immortal
honor oft its brave defenders, they were re
pulsed with equal courage and intrepidity,
â whieh gave time to colonel Dagrefs, with
350 men of prince Edward's Black Chas
seurs to gain the fort from the bourg below,
from whence indeed they were obliged to
cut their way. This reinforcement saved
the place; for it would have been impossi
ble for the English and Cannoneers to have
withstood much longer the persevering and
reiterated attacks of the molt daring and
desperate enemy, which never ceased until
morning, when they retired (leaving the
fort furrouuded with their dead) to a higher
ground, where they made a (land in Â»spite
of a sortie that was immediately made with
some advantage. Here they continued till
the 22d instant, when thev made an incur
sion into the interior of <flir cordon, took
and burnt the Bourg Dauce Marie, and
made an attack upon the Fort of L'lllet,
from whence they were driven with great
lass. In the mean time they were making
every difpofitioa for a regular (lege of Irois,
when fortunately the Magicienne frigate at
tacked their small fleet in the Bay des Car
casses, funk three of their barges, and took
two schooners, all loaded with ennnon and
military (tores for the siege. The Itfs of
their various attacks is generally estimated
at 1000 men ; it cannot be less than 800 ;
before .Irois alotie were found upwards of
20Â® bodies, among which were many whites
and mulattoes. Our loss was trifling indeed,
confidingonly ef three privates killed ; but
I have to lament lieut. Talbot, of the 82d
regiment, an officer of the most extraor
dinary bravery and good conduct; and lieut.
Cclville, of the Black Chasseurs, the only
persons wounded, and since dead. My most
pleasing Sir, is to bear testimony of
the courage, alacrity and spirit with which
all the troops distinguished themselves in the
various combats, particularly Monsieur de
Brueil, commanding the artillery, whom I
beg leave to recommend to your favor and
protection.
I have the honor to be, &c.

Brig. Gen.
Port-au-Prince,, June 20.
Sir,
I do myfelf the honor of informing you,
that on various considerations of great mili
tary importance, I determined to re-possess
myfelf of the post of Mirebalais : in confe-
I collected the forces, and calling
brigadier general Churchill from the Grand
Aufe, gave him the command with directi
ons to execute a plan that colonel La Pointe,
from whom I have -experienced the most
friendly and aCkive affiltancc had ably di
gested.
The brigadier general's letter, which I
beg permission to inclose, will inform you of
the success of this expedition ; but I have
to regret, that from some delay of the co
lumns they did not move with that exaCli
tude and concert I had hoped, by which
circumftanoe a considerable objeCt of the ex
pedition failed of success ; for it was my
intention to accord the prote&ion of his ma
jesty's arms, inthebeft manner possible, to
the inhabitants of these diftriCt*> by directing
the troops in their different routes, to march
with a fecrefy and rapidity that might insure
on all fides the furprifal of the enemy, com
pel them to a hasty retreat, and, driving
them before them, might prevent their hav
ing an opportunity of burning the plantati
ons, as had recently happened at Jeremie,
-or from carrying off the negroes and pro
perty beyond the Ariiboniti, at ths time so
swollen by the rainy season as to render any
passage over it difficult and precarious. But
I have reason to believe, from the report of
col. Depeftre, who commands in that quar
ter, that many of the negroes will escape
and return to their plantations ; many were
left upon them ; aud I learn with pleasure
that the enemy had not the time or means to
remove the coffee from the plantations in the
Grand Bois, which is daily coming into'
Port-au-Prince.
â¢ As the troops were on their march to
their destined cantonments in the Arcahay
Mountains to proteCt St. Marc from an at
tack preparing against it at Gonaives, I re
ceived "information of the army, assembled
unde. the command of gen. Churchill by
forced marches proceeding to its afftftance ;
and as the re-taking of Mirebalais was unex
pected by the enemy, it had not only a ten
dency to disconcert their birt, as
I had forefeen, give me an opportunity of
fending a considerable detachment by sea ,
from the plain of the Cul de Sac to the ftuy
mediate assistance of St. Marc's without
hazard. /
At the fame time colonel the Count-le
Rouvray, with a detachment of 300 men w as
detached to strike at the camp of the B i
gands in the mountains on the fide of L< o
gane. The energy and aCtivity of this o fi
cer overcame the difficulties of the fituatic n;
he effeChia!ly burned the camp and beat the
enemy from their several po(l6, kil'iug bet
ween 40 and jo ; and he returned to Gfe
nirr with the loss of two men killed and Te
ven wounded.
The enemy having attacked and earned
some of the out pods at St. Marc, began
the fiegt of that important place, but were
fortunately driven from before it with con
siderable loss. In the fuccefsful defence of
St. Marc, the undaunted and aCtive 1 courage
and military cond the Marquis deCo
cherell, have merited my fulled; approbation.
I have the honor to be, .

Mirclalais, June 2, 1797.
SIR,
I have the honor to inform you, that giv
ing previous orders to colonel Deffources to
proceed with his column, in the morning of
the 30th ult. to his destined post of La Selle,
where, to your excellency's in
struCtion, he was enabled to take post, I
moved forward with the centre column, len
der colonel Depeftre. We arrived, after
two very hot days march, at Port Mitchell,
not quite completed and occupied by about.
JO of the enemy, wljo retired on our ap
proach. Id the evenfng we discovered a co
lumn of troops descending the hill on our
left, where they encamped. A detachment
of cavalry was immediately sent to reconnoi
tre them they proved to be colonel Def
fource's columnâThis officer was unable,
from the badness of the roads, and the heavy
rains which we have had every evening to
proceed to the place of his destination ; he
therefore, in a very proper and soldier-like
,manner, marched and joined us, which in
some measure defeated your origiual plan of
cutting off the enemy's retreat by La Selle ;
but I cannot help deeming this junCtion
rather a fortunate circumltauce, as it enabled
us to drive the enemy from a very advanta
geous position they had taken the next day,
to dispute our passage, which, from their
superiority of numbers, (about 1200 men,
with three pieces of cannon) must in all pro
bability have cost us a number of valuable
lives to have carried; hut this additional
strength gave us an easy victory ; for no
sooner did they perceive a detachment of
infantry and cavalry, which I ferit to gain
the heights and turn their right flank, than
they immediately fled in the utmost confufi
ou, and jvith such precipitation, thi.t tho'
lieutenant colonel Carter, with the,detach
ment of the 18th and 2iff British
light dragoons, pursued them with that
alacrity and spirit whieh has ever diftingui(h- ;
id him, he could only come up with a very .
few. He succeeded, however, in driving
many into the river Artioonite, most of
whom peiifhed, and he had the good fortune j
to take t\yo of their guns, with their mules,
&c. &c. The third was most probably loft
in the river, the carriage being left behind.
We found the fort in the Bourg of Mireba
lais as perfeCt as it had ever been, and in no
manner destroyed.
We did not fee colonel Bazil and his co
lumn till near an hour after we were in pos
session of Mirebalais ; he was, however, at
the place appointed, ?nd, had the enemy
made any stand, would have fallen on the
rear, and have enabled us, no doubt, to have
given a better account of them.
Although the aCtion, from the rapid re
treat of the enemy, wa3 very (hort, yet, fir,
1 have the fatisfaCtion to inform you, time
enough was given to evince as much alacrity
and spirit to enter it, both in the officers and
men, as I ever remember to have witnessed.
I enclose a return of the artillery and am
munition found in the fort of Mirebalais ;
ajid I am happy to inform your excellency ]
that the re-possession of this important poll
and dillriCt was effeCted without loss, one
ferjeant and one private of the dragoons be
ing all our wounded.
I have the honor to be, &c.

CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men ill this
county have undertaken to enrich thum
felves.by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trails
of land, the properly of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
tra&s of lsnd large sums of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, fc'J innocent purchasers
It is therefore full tli't public information should
ba given, to the end, that t>c injured may feck re
dr*fs while the nen have property , and are to be
found. Those who have beÂ«n difcovtred arc Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Witsomb, said now. to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; ThomSs Kelly ar.d
fevcral others who go under fiwlitious names. His
supposed that the lands offered fcr sale 011 those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thcufand
dollars. Such as we haveaifual knowledge of are
as folfbws : Lots No. II and 12, Otfego patent,
tkoufand acres each, the aflual property of William
Dellw)n, now of London'; lot*j No. 58 and 64,
fame pstent, thcufand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Uichard Welisand
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from mipofing on indivi
duafs, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. W1 tcuni',> has Been
a (hopkeeper of some note in this sountry.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view tht"wickÂ«dnefs of those men, which when
' the public hive perused, will induce them to ex
cuffl the interference of Wm. COOPER.
