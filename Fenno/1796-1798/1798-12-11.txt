l.iflpiper it was fir ft presented to my kiiowf- 6

of this nioft impudent and wicked attempt to

COMMUNICATIONS.
Jl" WHEN we reflect on the downfal of tlie
t go>. . of Venice, G.nioa ilndSwitzer
Â£â¢ land with a vir.r to investigate the caufcs
| which have induced their deftrudtionj we
; (Jiall find, that not so much the strength
of their arms, as to the depth of their polit
. j ical intrigues, can tlie rulers of the French
â  republic attribute their fucrefs in those coun
| tries. It may indeed be laid down as an in
| controvertabk truth, that before the French
! republic have employed the prowess of their
c " I arms for the deftruftion country, they
e " had, by means of their inlidious principles
nearly secured the wiflied-for conquest.
m From hence then it results, that the firft and
' greatest dangers any country can be exposed
To from that nation, is not from their arms,
n " but from their flow and certain intrigues. In
corroboration of this, it may be alked, have
' e we not had our own country brought to the
S verge of mil . and nearly " tottering to its
fall" by thole Â»ery means ; anil is it not to
~ those intrigues that we alone can attribute the
~ oppolhion which is yet made to the late vir
-3| tuous and pontic arts of our government!
*} by these sentiments, it was with
much concern I heard our truly patriotic
)' Piefident, in his excellent communication to
le Corigrefs, declare, as his opinion, that it re-
I mains with France alone to determine, whe
ther the United States (hill remain at peace,
or Jliall embark herfelf in a war.
c : Are not the injuries and inl'ults which have
f j been heaped upon tts by that nation, fnfflci
y ent to warrant in the opinion of the whole
re ' world an immediate declaration of war ? A
A war which, in my opinion is not Jo much

* continues in her present ijiietftiotu of over-
Y throwing every government in iuirojje, that
Â» her distance is a fufficient protection for he r
y against ol a limilar natnre ;
0 and that when (he affu-'es her of a wi(h to
j cultivate harmony and mutu.ii interccurfe
between the two nations, that hrr real in

e | 111 this count.y, and finally, thereby to de

" SHEW VICE ITS OWN FEATURES."
1 he Governor, in his trimming speech, has
owned that there is now a perfect unaniniitv
in the people, to " m'aintain the dignity and
. rl o hts our government against the arro

. We cannot fufficiently admire the candour,
t and communicative wil'doni of him who comes . 1
forward to tell what every one knew, and we
are particularly itiuck with the acutenefs of 1
tne following obiervation : Â« this state of '

. is another cont'dfion more"aftonifhinr ft,ll.
and which we fear we (hall not be able ex- I
attly to comprehend till his Excellency will '
please to explain more particularly iz. *
" the spirit of party, intolerant and vindic- 1
tive, has evidently raged too lon r tor the 1
peace and reputation of our country."' We I t
know not what party spirit would injure the t
peace and reputation of the country, but the f
(pint of unoridled and licentioti, J
the spirit of Jacobinism, the spirit of tSe
apojlate lifhop and his agents, the spirit that
actuated the I.ogan'uin r.mbajfy, tlie spirit that
oppoled every mealurc wli;ch government

If it this party spirit which has raged
too long for the peace .- id reputation of the
country, what atonement can they make In
whom it was iirft generated, by whom it has
be-n cherilhed, '< y whom i t was feduloufiy

} TIMO : QUID NUNC,
f IVilmington, (Del.) Dec. 8, '9B.
: MR. fENNO,
THIS hopeless fink of Jacobinism has
been honortfl with, a vilit from Logan and
his wife Deborah. I apprehend the latter
accompanied the former merely to save ap
pearances. They put up at the old Jacobin
and piddling geniiw'a. Dickinfon's house, -
in the evening of th.? 28th ult. In the
; morning several of the leading members of
the disorganizing fadtion were seen entering
1 the houf.- ; amorg the group was the noted
Dodlor Tilton and Hamilton Rowan, the
United Irishman and traiior. On this fel
low's meeting Logan, they gave each other
the fraternal hug. That night federal of
the lower order of Jacobins met the envoy at
Dr. Tilton'sâlhut the doorâand what fol
lows time mud develope :âone ,thing is
pretty evident ; those United Dagger men
are plotting, and it requires no great sagaci
ty to predidl, that if government does not
pay some attention to Mr. Logan, fool as
he may be, he will raise a dustâl mean as
an inflrument for the diredtory of France and
America ; for that a directory esifts here,
as well at in France, I have no donbt.
N- B. Last night a secret meeting of a
fcledt club of Jacobins alfembled at the house
of Isaac Starr, tanner, of famous Jacobin
memoryâthe old fox, Tilton, prefentâ
the door fliut. Friends to government look
out ! the storm is gathering !
CONGRESS.
In Senate th's day, the answer to the
Preiident's Speech was agreei to, and the
committee who prepared it, appointed to
wait upon the Prelident to know at what
time it would be convenient for him to re
ceive it.
In tne House of Representatives, the
committee of revifal and imfinifhed bulinefs
reported in pa: t.
Mr. Harper moved, that a committee be
appointed to prejtffre and bring in a bill for
eftabliftllnan uniform system of bankrupt- â¢
cy throughout the United States.
. Mr. Harper also laid on the table a refo
lntion, the object of which was to authorile
the Secretary of State to cavife to be printed
copies of the Alien and Sedition law's, to
be diftnbmed grati. throughout the United
States.
To this he was induced, he said, from ob
lerving the unceasing. efforts which w?re
madÂ»' by a cert an class of men to bring these
ads into odium among the peopleâMisre
presentation.had been used, in order to ex
cite an armed oppofitian to the government.
