ITHE WA RNING No. IV.
THJ? France, when driven from every o
ther expedient for extenuating her depredations, have
a last refuse in the example of Great-Biitain. The treat
ment which we now receive from France (fay they) is
not werfe than that which we have received from Great-
Britain If this apology were founded in fa St, it would
(kill be a miierahle fubtcrfuge. For what excuse iÂ» it to
France, or what consolation to us, that flic, our beafted
friend and benefasrefs, treats us only not worse than a
power which is stigmatised as an envioas rival and an im
placable foe ?
i he conduft of Great Britain, appealed to in juftifica
tion of prance, was admitted by all to be inexcusable.
Hhe fa&ion thought it so extfeme as to call for im
mediate i tprifals. The real Patriots differed fiom them
only in thinking, that an armed negociation, to endinrc
prifals, if unattended with was preferably to im
mediai How dare the men, vtkoat that period
c ' ar * l . orcus champions of our national dignity,
how dare thsy (I pft) now to ft and forth the preachers,
nor of moderation ('or in the propriety of this all unite)
rÂ»ut of tame fubmiflion,â.of a fervilky ahje& enough to
love and cheyifh the which deipoils us, to kiss the
rod which flings us with unprovoked lashes ? What logic,
what magic, can render innocent or venial in France, that
which was to criminal and odious in Great Britain ?
1 he pretext (we know) of France is, that we have per
mituil Great Britain to treat us in the fame manner, and
that llie ads on thÂ« principle of a jult retaliation ; and her
deluded or debauched adherents are mean or proftitutc e
nough to re-echo the excule.
Let us grant, for argument fake, atl ihs t .can he pre
tended on this fwbjaift, namfclj, that through wan' of ener
gy in our administration, or from the opinion which - en
tertained of the situation of the country, there has keen
too much patience under the oppreflions of Grc.it
âls this really a juftification to France ? Is a defe<ft of vi
gour in the government of one country, or an under es
timate of its means for repelling injury, a fuffinrat caÂ«ie
lor another government, iavtfk.in profeffion.ef friendfltip.
to imitate towards it the aggressions w.hich it has fuffered
from an oppressor ? What in private life would be ftiid of
the man, who calling himfelt the friend of another, be
cause the last hud too paflively allowed a third, the enemy i
of both, -a wrest from him a portion of his property,
JUonld deduce from this a pretext to strip him of th; re.
manner ? Has language "epithets too fevtre forfuch a cha
racter ? Isnot the guilt of unjufl violence in a cafe like this,
aggravated by that of hypocrisy and perfidy >
But this is not our only reply.' The tru-h is (and a truth
â¢we may boldly proclaim) that we never slid tolerate the
aggressions of Great Britain ; that we have fleadily refill
ed them, and refilled with fuccefcât n the refpectal le at
titude of an armed negociation, feeonded by the felf-de
*ying and very influential measure of an Embargoâwe
fer.t to demand a revocation of the orders under which
we fuffered, and retribution for the losses which we had
fcflained. The orders were revoked and the retribution
has beenftipulated and the deputation is in a course of ho
norable and liberal execution redrefc of ancient
grievances, on the ground of a reciprocity, demanded by
every principle of redituuc, hits been fuperadded to that
of more recent ones. Our flag at this moment proudly
waves on the ramparts which had been so long detained
from us; and Indian butcheries alongthe whole extent of
our vafl frontier have been terminated. More than .this
âthe redress obtained from Great Britain was a principal
cause of the happy eecommodation of our dispute with I
Spainâof the recognition of our right to navigate the
Itfiffifippi, and of (he establishment ef a Southern bound
ary equal to our mod fanguin# wifnes*. These ate the
â¢ fruits (and immense fruits they are) of a vigorous
temperate resistance to the aggreflions of Great Britain T
'Tis therefore in every sense falls, that our Govern
meat has permitted Great Britain to, do as France is now doing.
Exc.-pt here-ar.d there the accidental irregularity of the
commander of a particular (hip, .there is not one dear
-right which the Jaws of nations entitle us to claim, that is
not now refpededby Great Britain, and to a degree unu
sual in the biilory of the treatment u.f neutral nations by
great belligerent pe wet's.
It follows, that "the fugjjeftion on which France bot
toms her ill treatment of us, "is a frivolous and a colourless
pretext. 'Tis to confound all jull ideas, to corifid?r a tem
poral y foroearance as a permission or acquiescenceâto pre
tend to retaliate upon an injured party the injury which it
has endured from another, to preten i abttve a!I to retali
ate that injury after it has pjffed, hasceal'ed, an,d has been
redrefled. We are hound then to conclude, that our real
crime in the eye ofÂ«J ranee is, tnat we had the temerity
to think and to ail for ourfelvss, and did not plur.ge head
long into war with Great Britain,âthat the principal
flreams of our commerce, from the natural relations *f
demand and fuj.plys, fltiw through the channels of her
commerceâand that the booty which' it Offers to rapacity,
exceeds the erganifed means of protection.
But a country, containing five millions Â«f people, the"

CONGRESS OF tub UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVfS.
Friday, January 20.
Mr. Coil allowed that nothing was ij)oit (?!ear
than that the manner in which the iouthern fiates
psid iheir appottionment of thepropofed bnrthetT,
could wake no difference to thenof-rhsrii anci eailery
flairs; -but the gentleman from Pennsylvania
Gallatin) allowed there was some weight in tl;r
sbj oft ions with to the alfefjn.eot and cyllec
tion of the tax.
If he cm,ierftood that gentleman, he fa-id that
the making an enumeration of (laves would make
no difference in the expense. He did not know
how this could be. If two objvfts were to di>, viz.
t-o value arid assess the .'and, and to enumerate and
value the flivesv, it was new dixfli ine to him, if chele
Uwo things would not cost more than if Qrtl}' one
had been done ; or, if this business would be done
for nothing, it would be one of the firlt things the
United Sates had had done upon those terms,
Upon the colle&ion there ivoijld also be an addi
tional expense, and a probability of loss ; the more
detail there was in the Lufineis, the greater the
liability to error and loss to the United States; and
in proportion to this loss, would theie states pay
less than others.
Mr. Hartley said he-fliould at present yore for
the propofiiion ; but Ihould fee! himfelf at liberty
to vote differently on the bill, if he did not ap
prove it. JDifficultirs arose in his mind as to the
propriety of fixing personal property in one state
and nut in another, by which meajis a bonnty feem
eA to be given.on land in the southern states to the
amount ol the difference of the taxes between the
land in those states and that in other ftatÂ»s, upon
which purchasers would naturally calculate. This
difficulty iright probably be removed from his
mind ; and, therefore* in order to give the whole
bufkiffs a fair chance, he should wish the refalution
'to go back to the committee of Ways and Means
to bring i/i a bill.
Mr. Page did suppose that gentlemen coming
from states which were in the habit of cÂ«llefting
direct taxes, would have endeavoured to accommo
date the business to thefuuation and ciroumftances
of different states, so as to make the fyflem the mok
convenient to each. He did Juppsfe, that when
ever it should hav/been determined to enter .upon
direst taxation, that funas would have been sppor
tioned to each state, aÂ«d that they would have
been left to themftlves to have rasfed the money in
the way which they thought most convenient, in
superable objedtions, however, it seemed had been
found againlt this fyflem, 1 as appeared from the re
port of the Secretary of the Tieafury j but it was
I unreasonable that the northern dates should comr>
plain that the fouriiern states would pay the tax
with greater facility than them. They might, he ,
'said as well complain sgainft the lichnefs oi their
foil, or the waimnefs of 'their climate. 1
With rtfpefl to the tax falling lighter on theÂ®
than on other states, those who held flaveÃ would 1
find it lighter, but those who had none, would not.
But he thought it extraordinary, that whilst they !
were ttpbraidea with holding a fptcies of property
peculiar .to Uici'i country, they (Hoyld also be tip- 1
braided with wishing to pay a duty upon that pro- !
perty. _ ' ,
Mr. P.Jfaid he did not fee what difference it cÂ»nld i
make to other states, that thÂ«y raifeel a-part of the
tax required of them from -slaves. Tiie fecretaiy I
of the trealnry had recommended this mode, the
committee of ways and means, had reported accord i
inoly, and they were ready to pay a tax far their
slaves, in addition to* the expence they were at for '
them already ; for it should be recJiefied that per
son's holding Caves, contribute largely to the duties ;
collefted from imports, by the purchase of-flannels
and cleth, rum molafles.&s. neceflary for their food 1
1 and clothing. â 
If a person living in s state whete fiavery did rot
exist, paid something more for his land, the differ- j
er.ee was certainly not equal to the fatisfa&ion he
must enjoy, in lefktting that his state was free from
that evil. His land, on that account, would be ! 1
worth three times as much, as land of the fame ! ;
quality in the Southern States. Why, then, do I :
gentlemen complain ? The Southern States them 1
selves might have objeaed to this tax ; they might 1
have doubted the constitutionality oÂ£it indeed he 1
did doubt it, but he had agreed to it ; and he be- ' 1
lieved- there was no better way of making thÂ« tax
go down io tlioff states, thaa fay the prcicm *mea i
sure. _ 'l|
For his own part, Mr. P. said, he wished he lived ;
wher.e there was no slavery ; and if he could find a i
climate he liked as well, he would change his .iitua- j
tions on that account.
Mr. Brent said itwasa-very extraordinary thing
that gentlemen who represented states where there :
were no slaves should oppose a tax on that (penes i
of property, and that ties Southern states where
tavery existed, fhould-be advocating that tax.
By the report of the fecretaiy of the treasury,
there appeared a deficiency of revenue, and in order 1 ,
to supply that deficiency, they had determined-to !
have recourse to direct taxes j and, after the amount
which each state ought to furnifh, had been afcer- ;
tained, he thought it should have been left to the
different states to have raised the money from such
funds as they judged best, provided they had been 1
ecure. This, he thought, would only have been ;
liberal and proper. It had, however, .been deter- I
mined othcrwife ; but, ftom a knowledge that by ,
introducing land and slaves together, a3 objects of 1
taxation, the tax would be more equally levied in 1
the fouiljern states, that plan had been adopted. ,
And surely, he said, -it could have given no satis- j-f
faftion u any-other state, that by laying, a
land only, ,it fnould have operated in a very op. t
preffive manner infomt parts of the fomhern state.,
and scarcely have been felt at all in other .parts of, ,
those states ; and yet this fhovld appear to be the ! ,
opinionl of the gentleman from NewHampfti,/; ,
for he had said, if this law pafftd, a person poffrlT- [ t
ing landed property in New- Hampshire of the va- f
lueof 10001. would pay more than a-land holder f
to that amount in the foutheru states. And was
this, he af3;ed, a fubjra of regret ? If the state bf c
Virginia paid the amouat required of her in a raafi . j \
- - " â  * - - * agâ¢
ntfr which bore most upon tiie ivhol: oF her
ci'ixcps, oKght ll at to dilpjtafe the citiiens of other
states ? j He thought not. He wasof opinisn that
it would be t defirabh thing that the taxfhiittld be
found to fall equally 011 the citizens of every (late,
t Anoiher objection produced iaj the gentleman
s fmm ConneAi.-ut, ftlr. Goodric ) was that a tax
011 this species of p'operty would not be so secure
y as a tax an land if that ge.uleman had bt-;n ac
â¢ 4,'uianted with the Southern States, he wo.uld have
" known that Slaves so mcd the most certain fund of
â¢ those states ; f.>r whijlf tjjeir wild and ex:enfive
waste lands would not command any price, slaves
t were always ready fclCi Hence it arose that the
Â« States were not able to raifc a tax on land, wbilft a
v tax on slaves had never failed to be productive.
Wjih refpedt to the inconvenience or expence
1 attending a tax on slaves, in Virginia, he said no
; cxpence wptjd be necessary ) bacaufe it was the cuf
10m of that to take annually a lift of their
- slaves ; which \yas regularly recorded in tbe ar
â  chives of the flaie. if gentlemen were, theieforc,
so economical that they would not expend a few of
the public police to get a lift of this property, let
: them recHr to the dooHrr.ent he had tjient-ioned,
' whick might be done without expence.
â  To those who know thefituatian of the Sauth
' ern States, the icinaiks made by the gectlemÂ»n from
Pennfylvann fMI", ipatlati*) must have been irre
" fttiatly impreffiye. Almoll the whole ps the lower
part of the country possessed property of this kind,
â  whilst the upper parts had scarcely any. if a tax
was therefore, imposed upon land only, the upper
: part of the country would i>e extremely aggrieved,
â  and would murmur, and they ffayM myrmui with
â  j lift ice.
Gentlemen from the Eastern States called tipen
the Rt prefentatives of thÂ« Southern States to point
out a mode by which they might come at the per
ianal property of their states. But, he v.vsuld afic
them, if, independent of land with its improve
ments, they poffeffid any other species of properly
which could not be eluded ? He bclievtd they could
not point it out ; why then, call upon gentlemen
from tiie Southern States to do, what they, who
certjinly tnew best their own rcfources, were un
able to do.
Tie Gentlemen from the & uthern States, he
said, had <Lfcovered those .objects which *hey tho't
belt attic to bear the butlhen j and if the reprefenta -
tives of the other states weie not fatisfied with tfie
tax on iand, ; let them come forward and fay what
other propetty they have equally secure, upou which
a tax may be laid,
it was a phenomenon, he woald again fay, that
the Representatives of states where slaves existed
should be contending for a tax upon Oaves, and that
Members irora (kites where flayes were not tolera
ted, were oppofmg it. He could not help believ
ing that the real object of gentlemen had not ftfcen-i
avowed. It was lomething hidden and unieen.
Mr. Kittera said that the oppofers of this part
of the Refoituion, were the oppofers ef a direct
tax a'tegetlier. It w*s obferveable that those up
on whom the tax would fall did not complain, it
was extraordinary that the complaint should come
frum another quarter. As to the objeAion of his
colleague (Mr. Hartley) that part of the tax be
ing iaTtrtn slaves rn the Southern States, would af
fedt the value of land, he said it would make no
difference whether the tax was on land or flavet, as
it sfTrded land, itsoperation would be the fame,
it was. ttietcfoce no foliil ohj;ftion agaii.lt the iefo-
Uuion.
Ihe question was then ti-Xen by Yeas end Nays
and tarried .68 to 23.
i he Hsufethen went into a committee of the
whole on the bill for giving effeft to the laws of the
United States in the state us Teuncffee, Mc. .Coit
in the chair. ' " s
A coufiderable debate took place (which howevÂ» '
er was r.ot of fafficient importance to be given in
detail) on the fubj.-A of the saLary of the Diftna i
Judge to| be appointed under the ad. The bill <
provides that he lhall he paid icod dollars a year. '
j Mr. Swift moved to amend the bill by striking out 1
iooo, to insert in its place Bqo. The motion was j
supported by. Messrs. Williams, Hei derfon, W. ]
Smith, W, Lyman and Kiitera.on the ground of I
< 800 dollars being fufficieut to afford a lia-.dfome 1
maintenance in that countiy ; that it was equal to 1
: the pay of anyjudge in the union, considering ihe <\
. duuejric Â«oult] have, and the ctieapnefs of livings J
that if compared to the fabrics allowed by that state t
toiisufficcis, it wjs'a high falaty, aj their ditttift 1
judges were allowed only 68 dollars a eircwit, aÂ«d 1
! their governor only 650 dollars ; that if more was !
allowedJt wowld teed to make their officers diffat- c
â  lined with thc lr pay ; that to pay a larger sup.i ?
j would bring a charge of extravagance upon the r
(.government that the district judge of Vermont 1
j had only 800 ; and that if [Â©oo were given to the '
judge of Tennessee, it would not,only lead him to v
' expeft on augmentation of salary (which he had al- 1
reariy applied f o r) but every judge in the union 1
would expea to be advanced. This, it was said 1
waS a fenous confiderati.-n, since a judge's f a ]' <
j could not be.lowered, and to hold out the idea that v
they might be mcreaftd 01 application, would have ! c
the effeato make the judges in some decree de- t
pend on that House. The piefent want of 1
alto cautioned them aga-.nft extravagance. 1
On the other hand, Messrs. A. jackfon, Hoi [
land Blount, Macon, Buck, Thatcher, and & c
Smith were in favonr of the salary being 1 0 Â«o del- f
lars. in order .to induce men of abilities to accept '

One of the mod important difcuflUns which has of late
engaged the Legislative Body, is undoubtedly that relating
to the law of the 3d of Brumaire, nv which the relations
of immigrants are excluded from all ptit-licfuhAions what
soever. There are two opinions dire<sfcly oppolite : one J
for the ftriit and unqualified adherence to that law, aÂ»in~ t
difpenfaftly necessary to the preservation of a republican j
lormâthe other for its entire abrogation, as being contra-
ry to the constitution and to the rights; of citizens : tbe
Council of Five Hundred has adopted the njcdiunj be

For three dayÂ» past the Auftrians have cannona
ded with great vivacity from their bakeries on the
left of tViellle of the Rhine, and the French bridge
ef boat 6. The 28th Nov. at 4 o'clock P. M. the
bridge was separated by a well dire&ed Itiot, in
filch manner, that the French who occupied the
Klc found 'heir communication with the Fortress
of Huuingue cut off. This excited
the attention o f our magillra esâthey judged pro
per to Heat the alaim : all the inhabitants took
trms, and the troops were lent to occupy the fron
tieis, These difpofitfons have nui however, piodu

Yeflerday zt II o'clock at night the Auftrians
an attack on the head of the bridge of flu
tungue and IJle du Rbin. The aft ion lasted till 3
o'clock in the morning with the gieateft obstinacy.
The Imperial troops attempted with the gieateft
Luvery to tlorm the intrenchmentj three fcvexal
times, but obftaclei innumerable rendered all their
efforts intfleilHal. Col. Ctjtler was killed at ill-'
commencement of the aehun. It iÂ» expeftcd a new

tinue to hold the Isle, from which they keep up a
fcrifk fire on the Austrian batteries. They coin-
Bjmiicate by aUytng bridgÂ£ yvith Huningue.

The Auftrians having damaged the bridge as
Hunipglie Â£o as to render it impafiable, great hopes
wrre entertained by the prince of Furllembergâ
He summoned gen. Abatucei to deliver up in the
Ipace of a quarter of an hoyr, the head of the
btidge, all the intrenchments, all the batteries, and
all the cannon, which were 011 the riglu or ike!

it (hould be rellored at the opening of the oam

the fort, it was necessary to take it"âwhen the 3ag
had returned with this answer, the artillery of both '
> armies commenced a moll terrible fire, which is still
heard. " - M â 
At } in the evening they assaulted the firft
fort, which is leparated from the othÂ«r by an arm
of the Rhine. All the French garrison immedi
ately retired into the rear fort. The artillery then
ceased to play on both fides, and in it* place a fire
of mufqnetry wa6 sustained which continued an
hour after mrdnightânever was there a mare mur
derous canfliftâ those of the Auftrians who were
net driven from the fort, perished there.
The Auftrians loft ten times more than the
French. The dead exceed two thÂ«ufand. Aba

â¢-n Extract from the official Bulletin from the Head
lre Quarters of the Archduke,
an OFFFMBOURG, November 22.
Â»- This morning at 6 o'clock the French made
?re a sally from their entrenchsd camp near Kehl, and
attacked with the greatest jrapetuofity the village
he Â«f Sundheim, which t-hey carried. They also for
ia- ced some of the Austrian intrenchments. The.re
ne lerves rallied promptly to the paints which had
â  bcen they attacked with their nfual aidor,
and compelled the French to retreat to their in
n-enchments. The engagement was extremely
he brisk, efpeciallv at the re the village of Sund
heira.
Gener.il Mortau commanded thin the ob- ce
ject of which was tÂ» destroy the work* ancf th? â Â«
line* of c'jjit*evaHa;ioa, and mslie themfciees mas
tersof the park of artillery. -- v
Tliey proniifed themselves thereby to compel vi
the Aaftria.u to detift from thtis ulteiior projsfts on hi
Kehl, and to procure to the French army, tranquil
winter quarters. The confidence which Milted in
the advanced polls for a long lime was favourable ar
to the French enterprize. They a ten- th
ttnel the u.il -Â»|fy man swiftomed to fee them at th
the advanced ports, fuffered himfelf to be amuled hi
by their wards of confidence. He wÂ«s poignarded tn
before he had time to leave hiÂ« post, whipii was fur-
prized ; they entered one redoubt which they tu. k
by this inei ti, from thence they turned" the left of
the Austrian enrreuchrrient#. Notwithllanding
this advantage, they found tu moll ob inate re- g
itftancC at feveial of the point*. O e redoubt oecu
pied by 65 men of the regiment of Stzaray, after
having cut to pieces the greatett part of the column
which attacked it, was not taken, but by the death
of all theft Vave Hungarian!. The arshduke ar- Si
rived from Offer,baurg during the affair, and con
tributed not a little by bis prefcitce, by the eilthu- B
(iafm, and contidence which liis.prefence inspires in
the troops, to repulse the enemy. The Major
Gir.eral, Prince Frederick of Orange, whs com
mands the center Â»f the pofitio a before JÂ£ehi, con
duced hirnfelf on this oceafion in the ipwlt diftm
guilbed manner. C
He arrived at tWe momrnt when the coipÂ» fur- 5
prized had been compelled to abandon one part of
j tlrrftrve-.-. He marched darinffty at the head or a -
i company of regiment of Si^3"ay. The bold
! ness of (his troop arretted the assailants. During
; these tranfa&ions the reserves arrived, and the p
nemy was repulsed with considerable left- T his is
generally eltimated fiom 2to 3000 men. They
carried ayvay 4 pieces of eannon from the Anltnans
and spiked fume others. The archduke, who ia 01
aftion iÂ§ alw. ys wh'.'rSTTieit is moll danger, had in
this affair, | or 6 perfoÃS or hoifes killed and wound-
ed among a fniali l'uite, which he had with him.
The adjutant of gen. Latour who *ai of this num
ber was killed by a cannon ball. The Auftrians ~
the night following contra&ed the limits of the
French by a parellcl, which extend# to the Chauf
fee Â®f Neufmnhl, and that of Raftadt. The works j
which are not more than 1200 paces from the fort
of Kehl, have not been in thelraft irvterrupted by
the sortie of the French, and the Auftrians are la
boring to compleat them.

Citizens Directors,
111 the.night of the loth and 1 tth of this month
(29th Nov. to ift Dec.) the enemy auempted to
carry by affaull the tete-dupont of Huninguen.
About 11 o'clock, at night, three columns advan â 
eed upon the front and thefalient of the half-moon,
precipitated themselves upon it, forced the gates,
and efcaladid the work which our trajps were obli-
ta. to"*" 1 u ! f "I to a horn work
wti cii tfic enemv forthwith attempted. The gen
eral Abaiucci, whj defended the yate of this work
rendcted their effjits abonivc ; anil perceiving that
the foe which hÂ« lpade from the burn work (jpon
the hall moon was not fufficient to drive the enemy
then ce, whs attempted on the contrary to elta
hl.' 1 hitrifelf there, that biave general deteimined
upon a sortie in order to expel thera thence ; which
was executed with Â¥ courage above all eulogy.â
Qvn brave faldiers charged the enemy with an intre- I
pidiiy of which there aie few examples, and at length
succeeded in dislodging then) from all the works, ,
which they left covered with the dead. The pur- -
suit would ha ve been (till more murderous, had it <
not been for the wound'received by the general *Ab- '
atucci: it is lcverc ; but hopes are entertained j
that it will not be dangerous. The chief of bri- ]
gade Vigne hal likewise been wounded in this'bloody :
affair. We have made one hundred prisoners of the
enemy ; but their loss in killed ar.d wounded a
miiurtt to 18 or 2009 men. His right column has
â  violated the Svvifs territory. Our atpbaffador has
made his reraonllrances on this fuhjeft. The ge
â  neral Ferino, who give* the account of these e
vents, paffc# the highest .eulogiums on the bravery
> of the trÂ«iops. The gd of light infantry, the 89th
. and the 56th d.emi-brigade of.the line were char
. gfd with the defenfe of the tete-du pont of Hu
: uingnen, and relieved one another alternately.â
1 These three cerps have in a particular manner dif
' tinguifhed themselves during the whole course of
r the campaign. The chief of brigade Caffagrje, the
) chief of brigade Morel, the captain Foit, of the
â  light artillery, and his company, (who, Â«ot being
i able to site their pieces, discharged their howitzers
and rolled them into the ditches filled with enemies}
the chief of battalion du Poltevin, the ad
i jutant Sorbier and aid-de-camp are par
- ticuiarly diftingu,(bed. Many other officers have
, also given great proofs6f bravery. I (hall let you
, know ot them, when the particulars are commun.i
