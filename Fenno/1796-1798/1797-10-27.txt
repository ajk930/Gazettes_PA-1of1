Fellow-Citizens,
WHILST our city was almost depopu
lated by the absence of the greater part of
\ ! ie citizens in consequence of the late pre
vailing epidemic, a number of those ' of our
fellow-citizens, who were absent, as well as
those present, considering that the nightly
watch edablifhed for the proteftion of the
city, was, from its local situation, inadequ te
to the necessary care and protection of the
city, inasmuch as the aid afforded -by the
t inhabitants when at their usual places of re
sidence was wanting to their support,
in cafe or emergency : And an
idea having been suggested of the neceff.ty
of a patrolirig party, as well for the sup
port of order among the lower class of the
citizens (who from their Amotions were
most numerous) as to guard the property of
I" those who were absent, from the evil and
unlawful intentions and designs of those who
j might be ill disposed.
The fubferibers, .under these impressions,
j voluntarily enrolled thenifelves under the
authority and direction of the mayor of the
! city, and, in a subordinate manner patroled
! through efpecially those
t parts most vacant and uninhabited, from
| ten at night until five o'clock in the mfarn
ing : Atid we humbly trull, that our eir
. deavonrs have not been altogether ineffeft
' ual, either in the support of order, or in
the proteftion of the property of our fel
low-citizens. And as we voluntarily en
tered onrfelves for the performance of these
qtitics, we (hall continue therein, as long as
. the inayftr of the city (hall think that, our
arp necessary } nor we look
foir or expeft.any compensation for the trou
ble and fatigue we have undergone, were
our circumstances such as to eriable us to
support our families during filch ah interval
of fatigue ar.4<diftrefs ; for knowing as we
do how much the citirens in general have
> fu/fered by Uie late.calamity, we (hall rely
wholly on the justice and generosity of our
f:llow-citizens, and remain with the utmost
refpeft,

Gentlemen,
With ptaafifre T acknowledge, that, in
my opinion, your fervicesiavc greatly tend
ed to protest the property of our fellow-ci
tizens from accidents by fire aad against the
depredations of ill disposed personsâAnd
in the name of our fellow-citizens I return
you :ry thanks for your exertions, at the
fame time it is my opinion that after the
28th inft. the night watch of the city will
be competent fbr its proteftion.
HILARY BAKER, Mayor.
Philadelphia, 26th Oft. 1797.
Mr. Henry Deforeft and company

For the Gazette of the United States.
MR. FENNO,
WHILE I profefs myfelf one of the
Warmest admirers of the political pamphlets
of Mr. Cobbett, I cannot but express my
concern some of the sentiments of this
editor, in the late numbers of his Gazetteâ
Sentiments, which, with whatever view de
clared, seem calculated to degrade the Ameri
can charafter, and to cast an odium upon
the principles of our revolution. I (hall on
ly inftancc his comment upon the aneftdote
of Mr. Gibbon and Dr. Franklin, in his
Gazette of the 18th instant. Now, what
ever antipathy he may have to the cfcarafter
of the doftor, (which, upon the score of
generosity and political integrity, far be it
from me to undertake to defend,) he cannot
bÂ»t be aware, that hisSsdifcriminate obfer
vation will equally apply to a Wa(hington,
an Adams, a Jay, and an HamiltonâCha
rafters, which if I midake not, he has more
than once profeffed to hold in high estima
tion. What then (hall we fay of the con
duft'of Mr. Cobbett ? Is it confident, libe
ral, or wife ? He is an Englishman, nor
does he with to conceal his attachment to
the land that give him birth, its government
and laws ; nor will any generous American
blame him for this partiality. But why in
troduce comparisons, which can have 110
other tendency tlian to revive animosities
which all good men desire to bury in oblivi
on, and to widen a breach, which, in the
present didrafted state of the world, I pre
sume, the real friends of both countries wish
to fee closed ?
If he thinks the interÂ«ft of his country re
quires nothing less than the deftruftion of
the republican system, he has certainly too
much delicacy and understanding, to at
tempt writing down, under our noses. If
loyalty, in his opinion, can never be mispla
ced, he need not, however, take the trouble
of telling us so. If monarohy be his favorite
form of government, let it exist, fay I,
where it is already eftablilhed, and where
the state of society may perhaps render it eli
gible : But, in God's name ! let 11s quietly
enjoy,' and make the most of the institutions 1
we have framed for ourselves.
While Mr. Cobbett dirtfts his artillery
against jacobinic hypocrisy, and its detella- 1
ble cant, he is engaged in a cause which 1
every honest arid enlightened man must ap- j 1
prove : And I (hall be sincerely pleased, if i
I find that his ra(h and indiscriminate cen- i
{ures (he must excitfe me for calling them ]
so) are to be ascribed to petulance of tem- 1
per, or an indiscreet zeal for the honor of I
his country, and not to a deliberate plan of 1
discrediting the principles and confluences j
of our revolution 'here/whatever may be its
effefls in other parts of the world. ?or even I
upon the fuppofstion of its being an evil, i
ive are to look for its authors, to the other
fide of the water : Ancl let him remember,
that its principles were advocated by Mr.
Burke, the tnan, for whom he juflly ex
preifes fuc'n entbufiaftic admiration.

Continuation .of L*atefl European Neius 9
received by the William Penn.
LONDON, Augull 26.
Yesterday morning we received the Pan's
papers of the I2d and 22d inft. They are
I principally filled with the report of Thi
. badeau to the Council of Five Hundred,
and that of TYon<jon du Coudray to the
, Council of Elders, on the message of the
; Direftory with refpeft to the march of the
, troops towards Paris, and the revolutionary
. addresses of the army of Italy. The com
missions appointed by both councils for the
invtftigation of this message coincide in re-
J proaching the direftory with imprudence
r and impropriety of conduft, with having
made use of a harflinefs and severity of laii
. g'-tage which circutpftances did not juftify,
j and with having advanced ftatemtnts totally
P unsupported by fads. They consider the
j addresses of the army as abounding in ab
} ridiculous pretensions, and
criminal projefts, expressed in the peculiar
language of the faftious party, which, bri
| bed by foreign powers? has succeeded in
' seducing the troops to turn their arms a
j gain ft the republic.
The reporters of both councils declare
| their aftorii(hment and indignation that the
Direftory has not taken any measures, or
published any proclamation, for the purpose
of censuring these addresses, and preventing
' the dangers with which the nation is threat
ened from the daring enterprize Of a vifto
rious army, which assumes to itfelf the un
conditional power of deliberating. They
' further (late, that the objeftions made by
the Direftory to the proceedings of the le
giilatire body, with refpeft to the pretend
ed proteftion (hewn in them to the priests
' and emigrants, can only be eonfidered as a
means calculated to renew the system of
| proscription en majfe.
As the direftory had indiredlly reproach
ed the legislative body with having thrown
feme obdacles in the progrefi of peace, the
reports of both commillions observe, that
the councils have, for eighteen months pad,
uniformly called, in the moil prefiing man
ner, for the restoration of peace, and that
the events which have lately happened in lt
aly, particularly certain declarations of war
made by the executive power, without the
participation of the legislature, have impe
ded the negociation, and still retard the ter
mination of hostilities.
The commission of the council of Five
Hundred, however declares its readiness to
cad a veil over the orders, in obedience to
which the tioops direfted their march to
wards Paris, as well as to excuse General
Richepaufe, and Le Sage, the commissary,
for having issued the orders, on the ground
of their moral ch&rafters, and of having
merely been the peilive instruments of supe
rior powers. The report of this commission
concludes with presenting the projeft of a
decree, which enafts, that any deliberation
or common wilh expressed by the armed
force, except in cases deteVmined by law,
(hall be a crijne against the constitution, and
that the fending of any addrefies from one
body of troops to another, or to the civil
authorities, (hall be eonfidered as an aft of
sedition.
While the legislative body was engaged
in these eonfiderations, the direftory sent a
new me(Tage to. the council of five hundred,
relative to theexhauded (late of the finances,
and they earnestly desire that fufficient
funds may be provided to meet the pressure
of the public exigencies.

A suggestion is given in some of the last
Paris papers, that Buonaparte, immediate
ly on the demise of the pope, means him'
felf to assume the Tiara, awl to take the
Holy feat, under the a (Turned title of Pius

its primitive lujlre to the Church Militant.
Several men, as well as women, have
lately thought it prudent to retire from Pa

Madame Carnot and Madame Tallien.
Privateering was never at such a height
as at present at Rochelle. A letter from
that place fays, almost every tradesman,
even milliners, are concerned in some out
fit or other. As an inftancc of the money
made in that way a draper and a hatter
lately took 1800 livres in one day from pri
vateers' crews.
The sovereign people of Holland having
rejefted the projeft of the constitution fram
ed by their representatives, the " Quotidi

dent might have been avoided if the Batavi
an legislators, in imitation of the French,
had caused the constitution to be accepted
by the army, previous to its being presented
for acceptance to the people.
Duel.âTuesday last a duel was fought
neir Leith, between Gecyge Anderfon, eft],
late of Virginia, and Mr. Robert Barker,
the great porter brewer. Mr. Barker fired
firft, and wounded his antagoaift desperately
in the face, the ball carrying off the greater
part of Mr. Anderfon's nose. Mr. A. not
withstanding the pain he must have felt, re
turned the fire, and wounded Mr. B. in the
leg. The seconds then interfered, and the
parties were prevailed upon to (hake hands.
This unfortunate affair originated the day
before, and was occasioned by Mr. B. mak
ing use of sarcastic remarks on the rcgula
' ions of the Lelth affably roosfco, which
Mr. A drew up some years; ago ; one of
which is, that " no person ilmll enter the
TOcjtns with dirty feet."

The imperial envoy demanded of the di
rectory a categorical answer, and declared,
by order of his majesty, that he would find
himfelf obliged to recommence hostilities, if
Mantua was not restored to the house of
Austria. This decfaration being deliberated
upon, Barras declared, that he would have
Mantua, that he should never cede Mantua.
The question was put, and the majority de
clared, that orders should be given to re
commence hostilities ; but Carnot delivered
an impressive speech, In which he dwelt
with great emphasis, on the incalculable evils
and disastrous confequenoes, which could
aot but result from this determination. He
declared, that the protest of his colleague,
as well as his own, should be inserted in the
minutes, and that he would immediately
proceed to the legi(l3tive body, inform it
of what had palled, and make at length
known to the uation those members of the
direftory who wished for peace.
1 his firm and intrepid conduft intimida
ted Barras and Rewbel; the resolution was
repealed, and the treaty of peace was signed.

PARIS, Aug. aj.
The placards begin to appear. This morn
ing three new ones were polled up with the
greatefl profufion. The firft entitled Card aux
Boutiques ; " Take care of your Ihops," allures
us that the Jacobins, Anarchilts, &c.are to plun
der the {hups Â»f Paris, and advifei the Ihop
keepers to be 011 their guard. The aim of the
second is to prove that the armies <wiiJ not match
agattflt their fellow-citizens and friend., the peo
ple of Paris that though they (honld, their ef
forts would be ineffectual. T,he thiid, entitled
Le Demicrate Ctrjtilbtionnel,i> the firft number

of maintjitiingthe constitution, which he aflures
the royalifis have formed the plan to deftioy.
The troops in the departments begin to ihew

address in the fame sense with those presented
by the army of Italy, when they were dissuaded
from taking fueh a step by citizen Veillet, na

cafion. and quelled their alarms.
The law for the organization of the national
guard has at length been pi.bliflied. It had been
fe'aled twenty-four hours ago, and that it had
not been sooner promulgated is the fault of the'
ministers.
The majority of the committee, frem which
Thihaudeau made his report, hid drawn up a
resolution, purporting that Paris, being within
the conflitutional circle, formed no part of the
territory comprised in the 1 ythMilitaryDivilion,
and consequently that the General Staff could
not relide there. But Thibaudeau, seconded by
Simeon and Emery, flrongly dppofed this, and
refufed to make his report, which was on that
account delayed a day ; Vaublanc, Jiowever, be
ing of his opinion, the resolution was dropped.

COUNCIL OF FIFE HUNDRED.

A citizen employed in the office of the

his having been turned out of his employ

Boifl'y D'Anglas rose on a motion of or
der. He declaimed against thofemercenary
writers whose sheets preached up the over
throw of the eonftitution. He said, they
resembled those animals whose existence is a
reproach to nature. Pamphlets are, how
ever, nothing in comparison with Placards,
which deserved the attention of the coun
cils, as they arc in the nature of a procla
mation, and tend to make a mob where the
citizens afftmble. No one but the constitu
ted authorities has the right to issue a Pro
clamation. According to a formal law, the
title of journals is all that is fuffered to be
crifd, and a Placard produces the fame effeft
as the contents of a journal proclaimed by a
news-carrier. The liberty of the pres3 per
mits Placards, but no dangerous ones ; I
therefore demand, that the Placards before
they are potted up fliould be submitted in
manuscript to the eonftituted authority.
Coupe demanded the order'of the day, be

Dumolard supported the proportion of
Boifl'y, distinguishing acommonwriting from
a Placard ; the former of these relates only
to private persons ; the latter is a real pro
clamation. It addrefTes itfelf to men in an

fy to be referred to a committee charged to
inquire into the errors of the press.
Lebardy demanded the Â«rder on all tlie

jourdan (General) in atnotion Â»f order,
denounced to the council, a letter, which
the commandant of the guard of the legifla

The letter was as follows:
"I owe it to my placeâl owe it to the
1 brave grenadiers whom I have the honour
to commaud, to explain to you my fenti

every fide to make uÂ» party-o*en, when we

the grenadiers and thsir chiifs wfll never
depart from their duty : the sentiments
which animate them ought to be a sure
warrant to you, that they will never sepa
rate their cause from that of true republi
cans."
Jourdan maintained, that this phrase fig
nified an apprehension that there were-men
in existence who wanted the conflitution o
verthrown. He demanded that it be sent
to the committee of infpe&ors, to examine
into the motives which gave rife to it.
Dumolard, in making an eulogium on the
intention of Jourdan, did' not interpret the
phrase in the fame manner, .he gave it a more
simple interpretation, and he acknowledged,
that to a certain degree RaWel 'was wrong,
but he must r,6t be accused without proof.
The council ordered the discourse of
Jourdan to be printed, and to be sent to a
committee of infpeftors.

The man must be a fimpling, indeed,
who will not listen.
Is it not Wisdom, who criethâand Un
derstanding that putteth forth her voice ?
Btri Hefdin tells youâ(lie is this very mo
ment on the top of high places ; calling a
loud to the crazy politician, stupid state's
- man, weeping speculator, broken merchant,
ragged fpendthrift, and groaning debauchee
turn in hither; and I will pour oil and
wine into your wounds ; give you riches
more durable than time, and maidens whÂ«fe
pleasures increafc with pofleffion."
What a generous foul! And will ye not
turn in, ye wayfaring fools ; but still pu(h
on, heels over head, in pursuit of lands m
â¢ the moon, and the fhadÂ»w of phantoms?
Do glittering bubbles still deceive him that
travelleth at noon-day ? And are the great
men of the earth still disputing about non
entities and quidditiesâwhile the rich feaft
j of so fair a maiden is past by and neglefted ?
| . Come in then, ye, who lack understand
ing ; whose brains are like a reed shaken "by
the wind, and your repast shall be as the
manna of heaven, which will ennoble hu
man nature, and reflore man to the likeness
of the Deity ; âyour drink will be wine
drawn from the fountain of perfeftion, and
prefled from grapes plucked in the garden
of paradise ; which will so purify the foul
and elevate the heart, so meliorate the pas
sions and operate on the bodily eye, that the '
vale of life will appear a beautiful paflage
to the temple of God.
By the spirit of Insanity !âthey have
all pafled by on the other fide, a. if some
infernal fiend was seeking to devour them â¢
except a few poor wretches without a ihirt
to their backs ; and a miserable gray-headed
Jew, who is limping to the grave with a
large pack of fms and spoilt wares on his
back.âBy heavens ! the worfd is mad.
" Hand me my almanac, John ; for I am
positive the fun is vertical, or the tail of

While John is hunting for the Almanac,
we -will just inform those poor ftmtlefs
wretches, that Wisdom hath killed her
beads ; (lie hath mingled her wint; she
hath furnifhed her table, and made all
things ready to receive you. But before
you set down to this rich repast, it will be
well for you to copfider the following in#
ftruftions. Read them, observe them, and
praaife themâfor these are her excellent
things.
Haft thou but two-pence in this world
carefully tie up one penny in the rag of
prudence, and make the other go as far as
you can. So /halt thou prosper in the
days of scarcity and ill-health. But if thou
lpendeft thy two-pence; what canst thou
do pa the morrow, should no man fay unto
theeâ" get thee into ray vine-yard or
should that frightful rifitant, Disease, knock
at thy door; âremember, be that gathereth
m furomer is a wife son. Yet let not thy
gettings be increased by the distress of thy
neighbour ; for if thou do ftâmay the
curses of eternal poverty crown thee with
madness.
Have thy garments waxed old, and do
the chill winds drive through thy fluttered
tenement ? Calculate how much is in thy
purse, aiid how much thou oweft. Pay
thy debts, then lay by something for to
morrowâand if thou haft wherewithal re
maining, fend for thy tailor and joiner*;
open to them thy wants, and let th-m',
with chalk and board, \um up the qiian
tum fufficit; make them give thee their
conditions on paper, and thenâbut not till
then, let the found of the hammer and
sheers be heard within thy walls. Let thy
careless neighbour call thee a close, stingy
fellow ; and the fpendthrift damn thee for
a miser let it be thy concern to hoe thy
corn and potatoes ; to gather in thy gain
at harvest, and thy fruits in the leafou there
of. Then wilt thou have wherewithal to
nourish thine own household, and feed the
wayfaring beggar. Thy fcoffers will be 1
glad, ere long, to eat the offals of thy ta
ble, andgathsr up what crumbs fall beneath
the feet of iailuft/y ; for idienefs wfli ma&e-'
pride crouch like aÂ» J ass with heavy bur
then.
Art thou a lone man ? and thinkeft thou
that two are fetter than one?. Then let
thine eyes be attrafted by her, who throw
eth the (huttle ; who feeketh wool and flax
and worketh, willingly with her hands. For
she will be better unto thee than checks on
the bank ; or ships laden from the East.
Perhaps thou art fond of high life ; tak
eft pleasure in dress and equipage ; delighteft
in the rattling of china and decanters ; haft
an ear for deuce, ace, and the thrum of a
Lddle ? Then get thee jnto the highways
of the city ; contrail large debts with deal
ers in trinkets ; negleft the payment of thy
tailor's, butcher's, fervanl's and all other
billsâexcept gambling. Spend thy days
in drowsiness and idienefs ; thy evenings in
laughter, parade and nonsenseâuntil Mon
sieur Catchpole leads thee gently by the
hand, to the damp cell of a prilon ; where
thou mayeft groan in the gall 0 f bondage,
and (lied two tears for every penny thou halt
faolifhly spent. Learn humility from four
bread and llale water ; industry from the
spiders that weave the canopy of thy draw ;
compaflion from the cool breeze, which
will at times steal between the iron gratings
of thy window ; and a love of order and
reftitude from thine own fu'fferings.

Extfuticn of threr Mutineers of the Saturn.
Plymouth-Dock, Aug. 21. This morn
'ng at fix o'clock a gun was fired from the
f!:ig (hip, the Cambridge, in Hamaoze, and
t'le Saturn in the Sound, and the yellow
fl;l|JihoiftÂ«d on board each of them ; two
boats from every ship in the Sound and har

marine, and conveyed on board the Saturn,
where they remained in fervent prayer till
about 20 minutes before twelve o'clock,
â¢when the fatal' gun fired, and they w(tc
launched into eternity : they behaved with
great penitence and composure, and begged
to shake hands with capt. Doughs, which
he complied with in the most feeling manner.
The (hip's company of the Saturn were ve
ry much affefted at the awful ceremony ;
the bodies after having hung the usual time,
were taken down and conveyed in coffins to
the naval burying ground for interment
James Dixon, feamcn, and John Evans, cor

The disputes between Austria and Pruflia t
upon the fubjeft of the seizure of the ci- c

it may be gmtifying to know the opin- si
ion of his Britannic majesty, in his quali- t
ty of co-estate of the empire, upon the t
cause of this dispute. jj
Letter of his m.yefly the king of Grcat-Bri- n
tain, to his majtjly the Emperor.
" The letter which your majesty has
been pleased to write me,of the 7thSeptem
ber last year, relative to the occupation of ir
the Imperial city of Nuremburgh, the de- t.
pendencies of the fiilhopric of Eichftadt, u
and of the equestrian order in Franconia, I pi
consider as a precious monument of the fen- I.
timents ofjuftice and paternal solicitude, by
which your majesty has evinced hew much
you have at heart the preservation of the
ionftitution of the empire, and the exaft ob
servation of its capitulation 6f eleftion, a ni
circumstance that must contribute to your de
highest honor. I received this letter with a no
sentiment of refpedt equal to the grtrtifudc fta
whioh the gracious confidence of which your lat
majesty thus gave me a proof had inspired ; an
accordingly I felt myfelf called upon to be- de
flow my most serious attention upon the th
objeft there mentioned, and to weigh it tit
with the most lively interest. arc
"Your majesty is perfeftly acquainted the
with the sentiments which I entertain with of
regard to the support of the system of the thi
empire, and the confederation due to its int
laws, as well as the invariable difpofitioas anc
by which lam ltd constantly to contribute oui
to that objeft every exertion in my power.
I could not overlook the importance and ex- A.
tensive consequences of the eTent in quefti- div
on, and I caunot but applaud the dignified Bu
wisdom of the measures which your majesty Ab
has adopted. Your majesty has exprcfled a the
desire to know my opinion and my thoughts Th
upon this fubjedt, and requtfted my inter- pre
pWition with the king of Pruflia. lam reg
persuaded in faft, that the electors of the acc
Empire, now with his Prnflhn majesty, in len!
the present purfue the course ove
that is most proper, since full of confidence tert
in the sentiments and mode of thinking of 3 o !
this Prince, they- have good reason to con- arm
elude that his said majesty will leave justice . vrea
its free course, and will prefer to every thing ' offu
th,e maintenance of the lawful possessors in cf c
the enjoyments of their rights. lam con- i the
vinced therefore, that I comply with your I dive
Imperial Majesty's intentions in fending to reafi
his majesty the king of Pruflia the letter, a hap
copy of which Ido not hesitate to annex.â- 'lonp
Nothing can be mote agreeable to me than thei
to have it in my power to demonstrate upon repe
enery occasion to your imperial majesty the
etitire and sincere confidence which I repose C
in you, and thus to teftify the high regard io,
with which I constantly am, &c. henÂ«
