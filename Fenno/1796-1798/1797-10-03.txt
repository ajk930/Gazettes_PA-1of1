THEIR superiority confijls in being free from

be more dense, Jolid and durable than any rollers
heretofore u/ed. Another important advantage
they' have over others, is, that the necks require
no turning, but are immedaitely Jit for use, and

JOHN HALLOWELL, Sec'ry^
It is a remarkable thing, butonethat.has
hitherto efcapcd remarks, that our anti-go
vernment men, who made
ant uproar about the detention of the Wef
ternPofts by the BritilhGarrifons,have to this
moment been silent and pafliveas lambs, about
the detention ofthepoftsontheMiffiflippi by
the Spaniards, in dirrÃ violation of treaty, for
15 or 16 months after the time stipulated.
This is to be accounted for by the belief of
all " patriots," that the Spaniards are under
the French and must do as they are bid; for
it is the firft article in all the democratic
creeds that " republicans can do no
wrong."
When Poland was cut up into three slices
for the three adjoining MSnarcbs, the mod
hideous outcry was raised by all lovers of
freedomâand justlyâBut when the French â¢
Republic begins to eut and carve for herfelf j
or her good despotic allies, it is all right e
nough with our " patriots." France may
overturn and take possession of half the dat?S
of Europe, and not excite one' democratic
murmur.
Jud so' with the privateering business.
When a British {hip of war took a vessel
or impressed a man near our harbours, our
patriots were all fire and vengeance. But
one French privateer puts in Marbleheadâ
another into the Delaware to look for Amer
ican vessels that are about failing, which
they take and confifcate, without ceremony
and all this make* no budle among our cof
fee house " patriots."
What a puppy-like temper isit that makes
a difference between robbers. " Iffachar is a
drong ass, bowing under two burthens!"
but our democrats are worse, for they wince
only at one fide of. the load, while they
meanly crouch to the other, and kiss the
hands that lay it on the (houlders.

think that the citizens of free America,

even of our lives. Let us not imitate those
degraded voluptuous fiaves of Italyâlet us
call forth that unyielding spirit-âthat holy,
firm, and patriotic zeal, which animated us
in our last druggie for independenceâlet us
Jet a mark upon our mo/l danger out enemiesâ'
our internal vipers, who, even at this moment
applaud and juftify the unheard-of injuries
and intuits we have received from France :
Are such men to be fuffered to remain a

citizens, we are too wife for that, and I
hope too human* to apply their favorite in
strument the GUILLOTINE as a cure for
their want of patriotism. The present 1
fay, it a serious and gloomy moment, the
dreadful clouds ofdemocratic-diieftory-fury
hang over our devoted heads ; for our fate,
in common with that of England and Aus
tria evidently depends on the success of the
legislatiVe body against the executive of
France; but, {hould the direftory unhappily
prevail over the councils, woe betide human
ity, for the druggie will be dreadful between
that hydra of carnage, anarchy and guiltâ
" the fire-headed monster," and the remaining
forces of- religion, morality, manners and
laws,throughout the civilized world. Thank
God, that our doom seems, in this refpeft
so closely linked to that of Englandâthank
God, that (he has five hundred rtiips of war,
and praised be our good luck at this parti
cular time, in being so much ia debt to Eng

all-devouring, all-plundering Republic, or
not, she, it is to be hoped, will take care that
we flftll not be rendered unable to pay what
is due her by the people of the United States.

1 ON THE IMPORTANCE OP QUALIFICATION
1 FOR PUBLIC OFFICES.
1 Fnm tbÂ» PERSIAN of ABOOL-FUZZUT.
1 POWER is a sacred trust committed in
, to the hands of the cjiofen few, for the pro
, tcftion and happiness of the many. Be
; careful, ye cleft, so to discharge the trust
committed to yoa, that vier. called upon
to render an account of it, you may not be
found-deficient.
Among other prerogatives of power one,
not the least in importance, is the appoint
ment to public offices. This, as it is ex
posed to much temptation, requires enlight
ened understanding, pure principle, and firm
resolution, to avoid abufesip the application
of it. To the eye of reflection, however,
the nature and coni'equercce of this branch of
human government are evident, ijor will a
drift adherence to the proper use of it be
difficult when a just impression has been re
ceived of the serious evils that spring from
its misapplication. Good rulers and wife
legfftators may enaft the bed laws, but if
regard be not paid to the feleftion of proper
men for the execution of them, they avail
nothing to the community, and often times
become the cloak of victf; the source of
greater evils than these were intended to
prevent. Above all, the due qualification
of judicial officers, the civil judge, and the
criminal defaand3 the mod par
ticular attentimi. If in any department of
the public service a regard to charafter, ta
lents, and habfts, be
necefTary, it is most eflentially requiiite in
the adminidration of justice. In this the
ruler is truly the vicegerent of God upon
earth ; and if he negleft the sacred duties
of his station, by delegating through frierid
fhip, favor, or felf-intereft, a portion of his
authority to men incapable of direfting it to
its proper end, {hall he not be answerable
to his heavenly judge for all the consequen
ces proceeding from his wilful breach <of
trust ? Rcfleft on this ye rulers of the earth !
and in the diftribtition of your patronage
tremble at the thought of being parties in
the misdeeds of unworthy officers of you*-
appointment. You are yourselves the foun
tains of judice through your refpeftive king- j
doms, and if the dreams which flow from
[ you be pure, fertilized and beautiful, will
j be your territories ; happy and grateful your
| people ; but if the current be polluted at its
fource> what hope is there that in its course
it will become purified ? It mud every
where impart its pedilential dregs, and uni
versal corruption is the natutal consequence.
To speak more plainly, judicial funftions
cannot be exercised without wisdom pro
portionate to the sphere of duty ; virtue to
resist every temptation to partiality ; and
zeal and aftivity to overcome indolence and
dimulate exertion. The magistrate who
unites these qualifications is a father to the
people under his care, and reflefts the highed
honor on the prince who appointed him.
But any considerable defeft in their effenYal
requisites, entails injury, loss, and perhaps
ruin on thousands : whether ignorance, vice,
or lethargy, fill the awful feat of jtidice, the
consequences to the fuffering multitude are
nearly the fame. The usurped rod of pow
er becomes the scourge of the human race,
and the unhappy viftims, who perhaps fee
not the arm that holds it, are either driven
by despair to the dandard of rebellion ; or,
in the hope of more benignant dominion,
transfer their property and their labour tb a
foreign land.
These art a fiw of the evils of disqualifi
cation in judicial, and other public officers.
I have elsewhere dated more particularly
the qualifications required in the leveral offi
cers of the royal household, the army, and
the civil government. What I have now
fuccinftly added, will, I trud, fuffice to
(hew the importance, the indifpeafable obli
gation of attention to the personal charafter
of every one intruded with a public funfti
on ; and especially with the adminidration
of judice. Truly has it been said that " as
lenity to the criminal is cruelty to the com
munity infeded by him ; so kindness or hu
manity in the appointment of an unworthy
public officer, is unkind and inhuman to the
millions who may fuffer from his defefts."

" After fifteen days fuccefsful navigation,
the fleet which failed from Venice, compo
sed of Teveral (hips of the line and some fri

having on board some troops, commanded
by Gen. Gentily, has anchored ill Corfu
road'. Four Venetian men Â«f war, which
were there, have joined the fqtiadron.
" On the 28th of June our troops were
disembarked, and took pofieflion of the forts
of Corfu, where they found 600 pieces of
cannon, the greater part of which were
brass. A great crowd stood on the fliors
to welcome our troops, with all that exulta
tion of joy and enthusiasm which ever a
nimates a people when they recover their'
liberty.
" At the head of this aflembly of people
was the Papa, or chief of the religion of the

approached gen. Gentily, ind said to him,
" Frenchman, you wiH find in this isle a
people ignorant of the Sciences and of the

for 12 days, have been renewed this

The Bred fqtiadron appears to be in a 1

On the 29th of July, the Galatea and

The present general eleftion in Ireland, it

A meflage from the direftory, dated the
9th of August, in answer to erne which they
hod received from the council of five hun
dred, requesting information relative to the
march of the troops in the interior, was
sent, it appears, to that council on the fol
lowing day. This meflage, written in a tone
of confidence, and conscious reft'tudeâ
ftates, that the coalefed powers had lately
manifefted (apparently in consequence of
the manner in which the council of fi v e
hundred had condufted itfelf towards the
direftory,) as much Urdincfs in their pro
ceedings relative to the negociations, as they
at firft discovered readiness to enter iuto
them.
Nothing official has been published re
fpefting the negociations at Lisle : we are
told in Perlet's Journal, that they conti
nue with increased aftivity.
General Hoche, in a letter addreflcd to
the direftory, afFefts to juftify to that body
tiie orders given him for the march of the
troop 3 towards Paris. This he does by pre
tending that they were destined for an ex
pedition against Ireland.
La Fayette and his companions are not
yet at liberty. . It is said in the French pa
pers that the direftovy have inliftcd on the
performance of the emperor's promise to f.-t
them at liberty, atid have declared that they
(ha!! corrfider this a<3 of a pledge of
the sincerity of his pacific intensions.
The Genoese republic has changed its
narrte. It is now called the republic of Li
guria, 3nd this latter title the archbishop has
adopted in his liturgy. â¢
In fpeakingof the late conflift between
the direftory and the councils, which ap
pears in a great "measure to have subsided,
Dupont de Nemours fays: " The direftory,
or even the Vnajority b&it, never had the in
tention to produce so violent a commotion as
that which has taken place. Those who
d'refted the movement thought they could
themfelves, and meant only to di&ate
to others. They had taken and wished to
spread a panic. They are themselves, at
length, frightened-at the abyss to the brink
of which they have brought themselves and
us. The legislative body, on its part, wishes
only for peace, and the preservation of the
constitution : it is disposed to forget the :
; contempt it had experienced, and the injuries j
| it has been expired to, for the purpose of
insuring tranquility and thfcfafety of the re
public. It is possible, therefore, that we
may get out of this very Angular crisis, and
r be in a more formidable state to the enemy .
than we have been before ;.more attached r
j to that constitution which we have prelerved
inviolate, but whieh will also have preferred
, us by the judicious counterpoise of its com
ponent powers. The dawn of a peaceable
day appears to break forth at the end of this
tempestuous night."âL'Eclair.
This is the opinion of Dopont, who is
now president of the council os-Elders, and
who has therefore an opportunity of being ;
well informed on the fubjeft of the confer- ;
ences that have lately taken plaee between
the leaders of the two parties.
All the letters from the department of
north are filled with accounts of marches
and counter-marches of the troops intended
to aft in the interior. A considerable difla
tisfaftion prevails among these detachments,
and soldiers are engaged in continual disputes
âftune taking part with, and others oppo
sing the views of the direftory. These quar
rels have already produced several encount
ers, in which many lives have been loft.
The accounts received frou France give
some reason to expeft, that the majority of
the Executive direftory have repented the
temerity of their past conduft, and are will
ing to favor the adoption of conciliatory
measures. Still, however, it remains to be
known, by whom the unconftitutior.al order
for the troops to march to Paris was given,
and byl what authorityâfor it is scarcely sup
posed that Hoche would take such a weight
ot responsibility upon himfelf. General
Hoche presumed to aft in contradiftion to
the positive orders which he had received
from the minister of war. The constitution,
it is certain, has been violated 011 a point of
the utmost importance j and if the legisla
ture wi(h to prevent similar violations in fu
ture, they mud enter into a full investigation
of the business, and hold up the culprits to
public indignation, if not to public jtunifh
ment.
Paris still enjoys a state of tranquility :
and the council of five hundred is engaged
in adopting every possible measure to ensure
its own fafety and the public peace. In the
fitting of Bth instant, it agreed to the pro
jeft for organising the guard appointed by
the constitution for its proteftion, and which
I*9 to be entirely exempt ftom the influence
of the direftory.
The fame fitting it was decreed, on the
motion of general Jourdan, that the direfto
ry should not have the power of placing any
commune in a state of siege, unless authorised
to do so by law of the legislative bodies.
His Britannic majesty, as eleftor of Han

AUTHENTIC.
We arc enabled contradidt, from au
thority the information published in our Fri
day's paper, of the 29th Stptember ult. con
tained in an extraft of a,lettei-, said to have
been received by the commanding ofiieer of
Fort Fayette, which dates, " That it ap
pears, iht inhabitants of Natches are in open
rebellion, and have dfplayed French colours."
"This information is wholly unfounded. The
inhabitants of Natches are at this moment
drongly attached (a very few excepted) to
the United States, the government and
laws thereof:âfof thid faft, they have re
cently gi-. en a striking proofâby fuffering
themselves to be restrained, at the intercejfiop
of Mr. Ellicot onh r froiij. an attempt to .0-
blige the' Spaaiarda, by force of arms, to e
vacuate tlie Natches,-and leave ihem vnckr
(he jurifdiSion of the' Ut>iitd Stales. They
are now waiting in *a date of tht* mod dis
agreeable suspense and anxiety for the due
fulfillment of the treaty." ,
Remarks and further information by the E
ditor.
The dory of this rebellion at the Natches,
| appears to have originated in information
; received by Qen. Wilkinfon, that about
,os Ga!lo-Americans near Kafcalkias or Ca
hokia had bound themselves bjc-an oath, to
observe certain rules and articles of a treason
able nature. That a candidate for this or
der was firft obliged to swear to secrecy, and
an obfervunce of these rules before being
made acqaainted with them or admitteo in
to the societyâThat one or two of them
had declared they were French and not Ame
rican citizens, and had got.a notion which
thiy weri circulating, that a French army
was on its route and would be there about
the 20th of Juney It was further faidâ
that this confpiration had raised the flandard
of the French Republic, and called themselves
themselves the company of the fans culottes.
The Editor does not dute thisfrom autho
rity, but he pledges himfelf for the truth of
the fadts.
This confpiration oftcltofrle in the North
Wedern Territory, will efince to the pub
lic, the intention of the many visits made to |

" Mr. Brown, i
" Having brought actions againd John- !
Fenno, junior, and William Cobbett, for ;
their publications against me in their pa- i
pers, I request you not to insert any thing i
in your paper which may be offered, in an- i
fwer to those publications, or in defence of <
my charaÂ£ter. " BENJ. RUSH." 1
[Whatever imputation the Dr. may have i
fought to repel by instituting his prosecu
tion, I know not. But he will come ofF .
with the consolation of having fixed on 1
himfelt the very heavy one of commencing, (
in the land of liberty, a persecution of the :
prrfs, alike unfounded, unprincipled and I
unprecedented- j
The Dr. requests his friend Brown not 1
to publish any defence of his characterâThus i
implying that ne it to have been
attacked.âSo far as relates to myfelf, this i
I think may be fafely denied. His do&rineS i
have been attacked with ridiuulc through i
me, because they have been held dangerous
if not fetal to society. But with regard
to his charadter, the cafe is now changed ;
and this daring and outrageous attempt to
crush a fellow-citizen for presuming to dif
fer" from him in Opinion* will, I prelume,
not only exonerate me in future from that
delicacy, in th;s refpeft, which, in what
ever has palled, has been mod fludioudy
observed ; but place it in a new point of
light to many of tboft even, who Jiave been
accudomed to look up to him as an Oracle,
both in politics and medicine.
The plain fad ij, that the Dr. still re- '
tains that fame principle of ambition and
that fame thirst for popularity, which has
ever didinguifhed him through life. His
great aim seems to have been to retire from
the praftice of medicine, with the fame of
an Efculapius, and to carry to his grave the
credit ot some wonderful discovery, which
(hall rank {iim with Harvey, or Chifelden, v
or Hunter, or Boyldon : But finding as he
advanced in life, that he had all along
grasped at what could never become other
than a shadow to him, which as he clutched
at it, vanifiied, and left on his mind no other
trace than, that of forgetfulnefs of what he
was in pursuit of, âluckily for him along
comes the French revolution, rendering 1
Blood the moll popular topic of conversati
on. Whether the firft rudiments of the
subsequent sublime discovery were drawn
from his correspondence with Condorcet,
BriiTot, and other fellow-philanthropifts and
philosophers, is of little moment. Certain
it is that about the very time these philan
thropic correspondents underwent the sans
culotte venefedtion, an opportunity offered
for him to break forth upon the aitonifhed
world, witli his discovery how to prolong a i
man'a illness for a good number of weeks,
or to carry him off, by drawing all the
blood out of his body. Immediately his
name was extolled as the father of medi- j
cine, the great philanthropist, the friend to j
mankind, by the afliduity of his frier.ds, :
and certain extraordinary means, which no -
man knows better how to avail himfelf of. j
Instantly empiricism took poflefllcm of the j
throne of medicine ; and the Dodtor and I
his apprentices drove about the city in their i
chariots, (heading blood in torrents where
ver they vfriitâtill four youths under his
own tutelage, fell victims to that very dif
ordtr which his vast invention had reduced
is much under the power of medicine as
any (light cold." This naturally daggered
people; and men now.began to assume to
themselves the liberty of dying in their own
way, Or at any rate rather of the disease
than of the Dodtor. As the Dodtor, how
ever, failed Hot in a very main chance, the
opposition at this time did not so greatly
injure him : and the zeal of his friends con
soled him under the mortification of having
his ipfe dixit disputed. In vain did any one
represent that the honors claimed by the
Dodtor to a physician of Spain,
who had by the pradtice of them, procured
himfelf a transmission to posterity in a cele
brated romance. It was for a long time
dangerous to dispute the efficacy of the no
ble science of bleeding.
A more considerable opposition has since
arisen to the fyfteni of extravagant bleeding
âand men's eyes have finally been so open
ed, that no other man of the lead eminence
in the pradtice of medicine, is found hardy
enough to avow his co-incidence with this
great empiric. For the part I have borne
in the traufaclions which have brought on
the " prafecution," or rather persecution,
I might owe an apology to the public, con
sidering iny almu.t total unacquamtance
with medicine, but that I have been rather
the medium thaiv-the Originator : But let
any man, whatever his ignorance of medi
cine, who podefles fnfficient uriderdanding
to draw an inference froirt fed nnd praftic#,
enquire, Who loses seven patients out of
eight ? Who pompously announces or causes
to be annoucced the recovery of almofl
every individual cafe of bleeding ? The
answer is so plaiti, that he that runs may
read. Who are those men that lose sewed
patients ? The answer is, those that bleed
â  fpÂ«ringly. Who is that physician who has
â¢ loft one patient only out of seventy, and
that one, through disobedience of advice !
Let it be anfwercd, a. man that bleeds spar
; ingly.
Are these not fadts of public notoriety ?
s Are not murmurs, ag?ind unnatural cyurles
1 in the practice of rtiediclne, loud in ourea-.s
s âis it riot publicly and' openly said, th?,t
numbers have tlui3 untimely been hurried
into their gravesâ And Stall zrn'.man in a
land where! freedom of opinion and of
expressing that opiuiou is fantlioned by tha
laws, be only bullied out of the plain
conviftions of his understanding, Bui be
vexatio-ifly persecuted, for ridiculing thÂ«
excess of what is granted to be, in its proper â¢
measure, valuable ? â  .
The faÂ£t is, and I have before glanced
at it, that a grand fcherae of the Doctor's
ambition met a.rough blow in 1793, and in
1797 a repetition, which threatens in pro
grefsto caftthefchemeandits author into the
[lhadfr of obfeurity. This has been effected
through the medium of the Pref? âand the
press, therefore, is the firft obje& whereon
his vengeance is to be wreaked. Confciou*
as I am, of the pnreft views, and molt up
right intentions, I fliall await with entire
corhpofure the issue of a trial, which I have
no .doubt will complete the downfall of
quackery and empiricism ; and will at lea ft
be valuable in one point of view, as it will
serve to (hew on what ground (lands the
Liberty of, the Press ; âwhether it is in
America an empty name or a valuable rea
lityâwhether that to which this., .country
owes every poffeflion of which it can boast,
aye ! even its liberty and independence, {hall
be trampled under foot by groundlcfs pro
tections ; and all those barriers creeled by
the spirit of freedom, as entrenchments
round poverty and obfeurity, ag*inft the
pride of wealth and the iafolence of power,
ars to be rudily thrlift down, and a liberti
cide medical tribunal established on the
ruins of reason and the wrecks of common
'
COMMUNICATION.
Tt is ?. fa ft of a nature highly interefttng
and fingiiirr, that the chief of our blooci-let
ters is highly democratic, and that his fedh
ries bleed in a direst ratio to their political
concurrence with him. Does not this cu
rious circumstance afford room for a theory
ry quite as ingenious as that of the harmtny
of aliment, and many others of a like nature ?
and may we not fee in this dreadful propen
sity an onjen of what the reign Â«jf Jacobin
ism would produce ?

CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men in tbis
county havO undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
fdves.by fabricating titles to fundr/ valuable trafll
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Varis, for which
trafts of Islfd large funis of money have been paid
I to those fraudulent men, by innocent purthafers â¢
It is therefore jull that public information should
be given, to the end, that the injured may feikro
- dress while the nsen have property, and arc to Tie
found. Those who have been difcovrred are Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Wittomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several others who go under fictitious names. It is
_ supposed that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at lealt worth fifty thousand
' dollars. Such as we haveadtual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. XI and u, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the aflual property of William
Dfillwyn, how of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
" Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and others, ot tbis State. There is some grounds
d to suppose that the lands of Richard Welis and
'â¢ Charles'Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
i management. âThe Printers will do well to give
" thi> a place in their papers, as well to caution l!ie
II public against purchasing tliofe lands, i\3alfotode
" prive those men in future from impofiQg on indivi
e dual's, which their education and addrels have en
's abled them to do here-ofore, Witcomb has been
e a fiiopkeeper of some note in this country.
e The following affidavits will set in a clear point
* of viewthc wicktdnefs of those men,which when
- the public have perufcd, will jnduÂ«e them to ex
e cufe the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 18th, T 7y7.
I l honi3s Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
e ing been led into an error, by John Wit- cmb and
n Truman Harrifon, of the fame Cour.ty, to sign a
h deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
d was the properry of William T. Franklinmow Mr.
Chamont's and others; ind further the said Joseph
and Truman did peifuade me to do this againlt my
inclination, which was made out on the icth day
d of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
o to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
n Pardon Starkstothnt deed was a fictitious name-,
e there being no such perton there. To this I make

r plication to Kim this .deponent, some time inthe

the value and security of the debt, which would not
have so operated if such impedimenta had notcxided.

The general agent thinks it his duty further to fug
ged that the several claims to be accompanied

PREVENTION AND CURE OF THB
YELLOW FEVER.
EVER since this difcafe made fijc!) ravages in this'
i city and New-York, the author lias turned his
ttention to its caufei and cure.âThe result of his
enquiries has convinced him that ?he reason why so
few persons recover from its attacks, are (rum its
not being well underllood, and the confcquent
wrong method taken to cure it. He is persuaded
that theexceffive bleedigr.s and mercurial reatment
of the Faculty is highly injurious, and that the on- t
ly rational mode of treatment is by theufe of proper
acids. Convinced of this he offers his Specific as a
certain remedy, if ufei according to the dirtilions.
