A very valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE
QUARRIES to be let.
I will rent my merchant Mill qt {he little Falls of Po
towmac. for any term not less thanfeven, nor more than
eleven years, from the firft day cf September next. The
g mill-houf :is42by 40 feet, three stories high, built with
stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two
overflioti 18 feet '.vÂ«t f and .Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and neceflary for
â * carrying on the bufmefs with dispatch, and at as little exr
penfe as poflible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my
[], landihg on the Potomac river, (wlure craft, of any bur
re then may deliver graiu and take in flour) it is about 40
' 4 yards, and from thenCe by water to Gecrge-Town and
the City of Walhington, about 3 miles, and to Aleian
-1 dria about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fufficicnt
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where large quantities of wheat ami other
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8
to 10 miles less than to any raaikct town upan tho navi
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the prcmHes a
Urge stone Coopers'fh jp, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At thp landing aforcfaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for
wardr.efs and probably will be finilhed the ensuing fall.
There are also on the premife9, a Brewery and Diftilfc
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or boilers, with every neceflary article, all new, and in
good order, and fafficiently large to carry on the Brew
ery and Distillery upon a very extensive plan. This prop
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon jny lands adjoining the pre(mfe9, Ind along the
banks of the river, where craft may lead with ease and dis
patch, is an i cmenfe q iantity of building and founda- j
J9 tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open,-and as many 1
more may he opened with ease : the ftose taken from these
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
separately or together as may btft suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the
mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac
commodation of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, fmoke
boufe, &c. aDd a garden, enc'ofed and in'eultiyation, the
foiof which is equal in goodnofs to any in this state. I
4 will also rent this4>roperty.
'S Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's
re (hop, in which is a complete set of Blackftnith's tools,
re which I will also rent, and "if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete
workman.
II I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,'
which were built For the purpose of carrying ftont : they
wili altogether bring upwpjds of 90 perch. Immediate
possession will be given. For terms apply to th#fubfcnb
er in this to\tn.
lis The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, withthe'f apptirtcn
of anccs, will be delivered to the tenant or tenants in gobd
-5- repair, and must be so returned, at the expiration ol Irr

CAMBRIDGE June 4.
A letter has just been received from Mr. Fy(he ,j
Palmer, dated Sydney, New South Wales, June ,
13, 1795, in which that colony is represented to
be in the most dreadful fituation v The military
officers monopolize all the trade ; every (hip which
arrives they immediately buy the eango, which they |
fell even at the rate of 1000 per cent, profit.âA
Mr. Bolton, who was sent out some time fiuce by j
government to cure fifti and make fait, hai never t
yet beep employed; anii on his Hating to the com- (
making officer that he would undertake, with the (
aflillance of boats and men, to'fupply, from Lord j
Howe's lfland in the neighbourhood, a full or even
a double allowance of well cured fifh, at the third ,
of the pi ice of beef and pork, 110 notice was taken ,
of the proposal, though the eolony at that time ]
" had not provisions for a month, though every per- t
son was at half allowance, and thoughTowls were c
felling at five (hillings each, and a cabbage at fix- c
pence, and pork at one (hilling and fix-pence per 0
pound.âMr. Palmer's men, which, he had bought g
at a monltrous rate, with his farm, were taken n
from him ; a message was also sent to him to pull
njf his hat to the officers, othei wife he would be t
confined and punished ; and orders had been twice r
given for no soldier to speak to him, though the ]
ceremony of " capping" the officers was never o- a
mitted by him, and though he never conversed with ii
the soldiers.âThe good undemanding which Go
yernor Philips took pains to cultivate between the
natives and whites was entirely done away, and a J
system of plunder and extermination substituted.
The natives of y the Hakfbury, (the richest land
possibly in in the world, producing thirty and forty
bushels of wheat per acre) having by cultivation
loft their favourite food the wild yams, poverty
compelled them to Ileal some indian corn to support '
nature, a crime which the unfeeling settlers refeut
ed by unpeialleled severities, Sixty soldiers were n
"sent to kill and deftioy all they could meet with ;â n
and a native boy, who lived with a settler, was (]
made t<i discover where his parents and relatives con- H
cealed themselves. The soldiers came upon them, fc
seized them, unarmed, and, unexpe&ed, killed five, p
and wounded many moreâthe dead bodies-were n
hung on gibbets, in terror cm. Mr. Palmer con- ];
'eludes Viis letter by hoping-.that on the arrival of d
governor Hunter, a policy will be introduced that u
may correÂ£t the many abuses and oppreffiont the f
colony at present groans under. i,
The late coufpiracy "at Paris has been evidently h
encouraged by the difaffeftion of the inhabitants of a
that city, on account of the old quarrel relative to t
the re-ele&ion of the two-thirds. This point, our f,
will recolledt, was "not enforced without a t
struggle at the time, in which many lives were loft ; p
and as we have often stated, force is not the way tc y
convince ; it may exterminate, but never ean produce
a chdnge ef mind. Thus the present governors of a
France would have e(labli(hed themselves much o
Â»nore firmly, and what is of mote importance, t]
would have established the constitution under which r
they aft, had they acceded to the request of the Pa- tl
rifians, by publishing the departmental returns, so n
>6 to have made it evident that the constitution was f<
Teally adopted by the majority of the people ; tbtV tl
refufal to do so left doubts on the public mind which g
have not decteafed, Snd which, but for the acci- tl
dental of the Dire&ory, might have pro- C
duced anothe"? revolution. ri
Our Jlrong government, and their violent adfrer- le
ents, might, (if they would ever pursue wisdom) tl
learn a salutary lesson even from this high-handed n
tfonduft of the regicidesâthey might from this I
know, that an obstinate refufal to gratify the peo- p
pie in their reasonable demands, does not tend to ef- a
tablifh a government. a
A young man in Greenock of the name of Kid, n
who has been blind from his infancy, has lately fin
ifhed the model of a sixty-sour gun ftiip, of about ti
five feet keel, with carriages for the guss, and every tl
â¢nece'Hary material and aparelling of a fhip'of that c
-rate, without any assistance whatever, or other.in- h

them to look only to themtelves for redress. We

It must be very unpleasant to us in the present
critical period, to mention that the persecution in
the county of Armagh rages with a fury that would
not discredit the ardour of Dioclesian. Such
unfortunate people as have presumed to stay in that

property; and others, who preferred exile, have
been_ hunted from the province, and harrafTed on

which is called liberal ; and this the quarter which

>' MONTEGO-BAY, August 6.
' l Last Sunday arrived the brig Phoebe, Harvey,
y from New-York, in 35 days. On the 12th of
July, at 2, P. M. in lat. 28, 48, Capt. Harvey
y saw four fail to leeward, about three leagues dif
r tance, which proved to be three large French fliips
" of war, and a schooner, supposed to be a tender.
e One of tkem, a 74, made for the Phoebe, fired a
' (hot, and brought her too, when (he was boarded
11 by two officers, who, upon iufpedling the papers,
were perfedlly fatisfied. They informed, that they
11 were four days from Cape-Francoisâthat Guada
e loupe was' in palfeffion of the Englilhâand that
- they were bound for America- They were desir
e ous of knowing if there were any Engli(h cruisers
â¢ on the coast of America, or laying in the harbor
f of New-York. They treated Capt. Harvey with
t great civility, and offered him any assistance he
? might in need of.
1 On the Z4)h ult. Capt. Harvey was boarded by
e the Swallow English sloop of war, cruizing on the
c north fide of Cuba, who informed him, that the
s Dunmore, of New-Providence, bound to this ifl
â¢ and, was taken the beginning of July, and carried
> into the Havanita.
â¢ From the GOLUMBIAN MIRROR.
a LtVMI PoW!ll, Esq. has offered as a Representative
of the coujities of Loudoun and Fauquier, at
I the approaching eledion of President and Vice-
I Prertoent of the Unittd States. The occasion
Â» produced a circular letter to the Freeholders of
f the Diftiift, from which the following is an ex
t tract.
AFTER what has been said, it may feem\in
e Ijceeffary to declare that George Washington is the
- man of my choice as President; and as Vice-Pre
s fident, to aft with him, I now believe I should give
- my vote to John Adams. These men have both
Â» been tried in their refpe&ive officesâwe have prof
> pered under their management, and I feel no with to
s make experiments. But reports have lately circu
lated that General Walhington has declared his
f determination Vj retire from public life j (hould this
t unfortunately be the cafe, the'queftian is, who (hall
: succeed him ? This, indeed, is a nice question, and
involves several considerations. 'Till very lately we
r have only heard of Mr. Jefferfon and Mr. Adams
f as certain candidates for the Presidency, and of both
> these there have been some reports, which,, if well
r founded, would make me reluctantly vote for either
1 to fill this important poll. Whether these have
; proceeded from party spirit, ought, and no doubt
will, be the fubjeft of enquity.
: It is now said Mr. Patrick Henry, of Virginia,
f and Mr. Pinckney, of South Carolina, will both be
1 on the nominationâShould it be so, I must declare
, that I feel at present disposed to vote for. Mr. Hen
-1 ry. This gentleman was at firft much opposed to
â  the general government; but, I believe, after amend
Â» ments were obtained, he became reconciled to it â¢
> for we have not heard of his joining in the cry of
r the present opposition againtt every measure of the
1 government, as has been commonly the cafe with
â¢ those who were opposed to the ratification of the
â  Constitution ; but, on the contrary, his late decla
rations condemning, in the strongest terms, the vio
â¢ lent measures in the last Congress, (hew
I that he is a friend to peace, order and good govern-
I ment. A ftrongreafon for the appointment of Mr.
i Henry is, that it may have a tendency to unite all
â  parties, and do away that ipirit of contention which
â  at piefent rages with so much 'violence amongst us
and threatens the deftruftion of the Union. I am'
, not fufELiently acquainted with Mr. Pinckney to
â¢ fay more of him than that his chafer is refpec
: table, is a friend to government, and that he was
' the negotiator of the treaty with Spain, which is
: considered a very advantageous one to us. I ftil]
â  however, entertain hopes that the fame love for his
country, which has hitherto induced the President
to facrifice all private eonfiderations to the public
good, will lead him to continae in office, at least
1 till the ejtabnfhment of peace in Europe ; for un
til that takes place, 1 conceive all his firmnefs and
good judgment are requiCte to keep us clear of
their deftrudive contests. If, however, he (hould
determine to retire, and you (hould give- me a vote
; in the chsice of a successor, I fliall conflder j t
duty to weigh jW ell the charaflers of the different
Candidates, and, to the best of my judgment, give
"the preference to that man who wjll be mod likelv
to preserve the peace and "happinefa of our colmtry
and the government under which we live
(hall be my firft considerations, and, in my determi
nation, public opinion (hall have its due weight.

- were advancing in force towards Heidelberg, to
tllr Â°vv themselves in the rear of the Auftrians, and
that the head-quarters of the prince of Conde were
J already in their power.
1 On the 28th ot June, the left wing of the army

" Liberty, citizens, advances towards us rapidly,

Our correspondent at Hamburgh, whose infor
mation may be relied on as authentic, under the
date of July 8, communicates the following parti
cularsâ
The French were mailers of Upper Italy, except
the citadel of Milan, which they were preparing;
, to assault. The repott of th? loss of 8000 French,
at a pass on the Adige, was a falihood propagated
in some Imperial gazettes, and universally be
lieved for some days in Germany ; designed pro
bably to aid" the spirits of the Auftrians, when
marching to Wetzlar to encounter General Kleber.
The Anltrian general put an end to the truce,
at the moment the conspiracy of Baboeuf an.
Droutt was to have been executed in Paris, and
relying much on the cffe6t of that plot. The dif
eovery of it threw the Auftrians Into Cqnflernation
âas it did also some of the Orleans party, who
are emigrants, in the north of Germany.
The French a:lrty on the Lower Rhine made a
Tapid progressâall the villages were deserted be
fore themâThe archduke crossed the Rhine and
Jordan pursued him. - The battle of Wetzlar,
in which the aichduke bent his force to affifl War
< tenfleben, fucreeded/ and a few days afiei, the.
action at Ukeradt, which was (till m<rv severe,
ami in which and a'her aflions the German ac
COlltitJ declare, the French have loft in killed
wounded, 16,000 men.
General Jourdan seemed not to lend any aflift
ance to General K.eber, and in the fame irae Gen
Moreau made a fpi it ed attack on the li--es near
Manheim, and drove the A.uftri ns to the Rhine
Cattle, near Manhcim, on the left, or weft fide of
the river. These were ma< ceuvres to aid the main
point; that of eroding the Rhine at Strafburgh.â.
â¢This has forced prince Charles to fall back with
his main body.
By this (tep the army *f the prince of Conde
is entirely tut off from a communication with the
Aultrian army; and must retire to the fouthealt or
inner part of Suabia, or fall iato the hands of the
French. '
On ihe 24th ef June, at Strafburg, it was given
out that Moreau was intended to reinforce the Ita
lian army, and provisions were ordered from a3 far
{is Savoy.
Suabia is a rich fruitful country, its inhabitants
numerous, and well affected to the French revoluti
onâit abounds aifo with rich abbeys and monalte
ries. [GiÂ«od picking for Republicans.3
The French occupy Raltadt and Ofienburg, be
low Strafburgâthe northern army of the Auftri
ans is retiring, a pas de geants, as our correspon
dent ex*preffes it, with gigantic (tricles.
Gen. Kleber and Lefevre have ,again crofiVd the
Sie'gâaijother divifiou' was bombarding NeUwied
* cn the' Rhine, and would soon reercsis. that river.
WarenfleuWn was retiring on the fame mure as be
fort, towards Wc ziar. The environs of Marihrim
have been evacuated by he French army of the
Sambre and Meufe. which was fupoofe*! to be
marching to Suabia. On ihe 2d of July the head j
quarter, of prime* Charles wrre to beat Schwetfin- |
gei,near HMdilbtr^. At Riftadt the French pof- '
fefled themselves of the iargeft Aultrian magazine.)
The French were to occupy Leghorn on th<* 19th
June, and were probatly at Rome eaily in July.
At that time aKo, 80,00. French were marching
towards Frankfort.
Gen. Bucinaparte, fix years ago, was a fiudent
