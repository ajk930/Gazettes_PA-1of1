BIOGRAPHr.
MALESHERBES.
'From " /necdotes of dijlinguijked Persons
ccnntSed with the French Revolution.'.']
CHRISTIAN WILLIAM DE LA
MOIGNON MALESHERBES wasborn
the 6th of December, 1731. At the age
of twenty four he bceame a counlellor of
parliament of the Caur ties Aides. He re
mained in- that important situation during
a period of twenty five yeart, and displayed
on many occufions, proofs of firmnefs, elo
quence, and wif loai.
When the prince of Conde was sent by
the king, in 1768, to lllence the magistrates
who taxes. Malefherbes repli
ed to hits, " Truth, fir, mnft indeed be
fnrmidable, fir.ee so many efforts are made
to prevent its approach to the throne." A
bout th: fame time that he became Prefi
degt of the Cour dti Aides ; he waa ap
pointed by his father, theft Chancellar of
Franc*, Supeiintendant of the press, a de
partment of office cr?ated for tlie purpÂ«fe
of endaring ideas and paralyfng genius and
philosophy ; bnt which, under the direc
tion of Malefherbes, served only to extend
and accelerate thtir progress: âTo him,
Trance in fndebted for the publication of the
Encyclopaedia, Roufftaii's works, ar.d ma
ny others, which, at that period, contribu
ted so rapidly to advance the (lock of puttie
knowledge. When learned men were bro't
before him in his offieial capacity to under
go an examination, he appeared to them
as adyjfing, aflifting, amd protefling them,
against that very power which was vested
in himfelf; and they experienced Jin him â <
ence, a patron, a councilor, and a father.
In 177J, he resigned the oiEce of Chief
Frefident of the Ctvr des Aides, and' was
appointed minister and f-cretary of ftjtein
the place ef VrilliereâThus placed in the
centre of a fri/oUus yet brilliant court, 1
Malefherbes did not in the lead deviate from
his former (lmplicitr of JÂ»fÂ« and manners,
but in lieu of complying with tk< cftablifh
ed etiquette which required magistrates,
when they became minifttrs of Rate, to ex
change their fable habit and dress, for a co
loured suit, bag wig, and fwsrd, he retain
ed kis black coat, and magitterial peruke !
As, whA invested with the power de
signed to fetter the freedom of the press, it
was his chief aim to encvurage and extend
that freedom ; so, when raised to an of
fice which gave bim the unlimited power as
ilTuing Utters de cachet it was their total fup
prefllon that became the earliest objcÂ£t of
his mo/} ardent zeal. Till that time letteri
decnthet, being considered as a part of the
general police, as well as of the royal pre
rogative, were issued not oiily at the will
of the minister, but etwn at the pleafurc nf
a common clerk, arperfons still more iafig
hificant. Malefherbes began by relinquiflt
ing himfelf thisabfurd and iniquitous privi
lege. He delegated the right to a kind of
tribunal, composed of the mud upright ma
gistrates, whose opinion was to be unani
mous, and founded upon open and well es
tablished fa<Sts Hp had but one more ob
jeÂ£l to attain, and that was to substitute a
legal tribunal in the place of that which he
had established ; and this objeft he was up
on the point of accomplifliing, when the
intrignes of the Court procured the dif
miflion of the virtuouÃ Turgat, aud Male
fherbes in confcquence, resigned on the 12th
of May, 1776.
After this epoch he undertook fevcral
jonrnies into diffcresuparts of France, Hol
land and Switzerland, where he colUAed,
with zeal and taste, objefls of every kind
interesting to arts and sciences Ashe trav
elled with th* simplicity and , economy of a
man of letters, who had emerged from ob
scurity, for the purpose of making cbfer
vationS and acquiring knowledge, he, by
that means, was enabled to reserve his for
tune for important occasions, in which it
might protura him information 011 in.ercft
iag fubjefts. He travelled flowfy, and
frequently on foot, that his obfcr.vstions
might be more minute, and employed part
of his time in suitably arranging them.
These obfervatians formed a valuable col
leftion of interesting matter relative to the
arts sciences, but which has been al
most totally destroyed by the fttry of the
revolulioniPts, who have dans as much pre
judice to the interests of fcienee as of hu
manity.
Returning from his travels, Malefherbes,
for fevtral years enjoyed a philosophic leisure
which he knew how to dire<Â£l to ufeful and
important objefts. The two most excellent
treatises, which he composed in the year 3
1785 a,u ' 1786, on the civil state of. the
prateftants in France, are wet! k-nown. The
iaw which he proposed in these, was only
preparatory to a more extenfire'reform ; aud
thefÂ« treatises were to have been followed up
by another work,- the plan ef which he bad
already laid down, when affairs growing too
difficult to be managed by those who held
the reins of goverment, they were compell
ed to call him to their councils. They did
not however, assign him merely (as fuble
quent events have (hewn) to cover thcirtran-,
faftionsunder apopular name, and pass them
on the world as afls in which he had taken
part. Malefherbes accepted their overtures
merely to fatisfy the desire he felt to reveal
some ufeful truths ; but it was not for that
purpose, that they had iuvited him to their
councils. Tliofe who presided at them took
umbrage at his to call their attention
to the voice ot truth and wisdom; and suc
ceeded so well in their eppofition, that he
was reduced to the oeceffity of delivering
in writing the counsel which he wished to of
fer. Such was the origin of -two treatises
relative to the calamities of France, and the
means of repairing them. He transmitted
thefc treatises to the king, who never read
them; nor was he ever able to obtain a pri
vate andienc, although a minister of state.
Perceiving the inutility of his endeavors,
disgusted with the repeated errors of the go
vernment, and deprived of every mean* of
exposing them, or preventing theit'fatal ef
fedls; after frequent solicitations he at
length obtained leave to retire. He repair
ed to his estate at Malefherbes, and fromthat
moment entirely devoted his time to those
occupations that had ever formed the chief
pleasure of his life. He gaffed the even
ing, and a great part of the night in read
ing and study.
In this tranquil state he was palling the
evening of his days, amidst his woods and
fields, when an unforefeen event called him
from his retirement. Louis XVI. was
brought to th* bar of the National Assem
bly as a criminal: abandoned by all those on
whom he had farmerly heaped his favours,
he little expeAed ta find a defender in the
man wbomhehad faerificcd to thcirintrigues;
but Malefherbes considered the fallen mon
arch merely at an unfortunate man, and aA
ed promptly from the diAates of his native
benevolence. He offered himfelf as his ad
vocate, and his offer was accepted.
Having difcharf d this painful and haz
ardous duty with firmnefs, moderation, and
fidelity, b* once more returned to his coun
try residence, andrefumed histranquil eourfe
of life. But this tranquility was of fkort
duration. Aboutatwelvemonth afterwards
in tke month of December 1792, three
worthy members of th* revolutionary com
mittee of Paris came to reside with him, his
son in law and his daughter, and apprehend
ed .the latter as criminals. Left alone with
hiÂ°9 grand children, MaleiVerbcs endeavored
to confolethe reft of his unfortunate family
with the hopes which he himfelf was far
from entertaining, when, the next day,
the new formed guards armed to
apprehend hrtn, and the whole of his fami
ly, even the youngest infants. This circum
ftancefpreadagentralconftcrnation through
out the whele department. Four municipal
officers had fnffici*nt courage to offer to him
ro mfurc his fafety, and to accompany him
wi'h hiÂ» family to Â»â  the Tiumilinting
fight of an armed foe.
In this calamity Maleftirrbes prefervedthe
undiitnrbed equanimity nf virtste. His af
fability and good humor never fÂ«rfook him,
and his conterfatiun was as usual; so that to
have beheld him, (yriilxult noticing his
wretched guard*) it seemed that he vat tra
velling fui hi* | U-afute with hie neighbours
and friends. He was conduced the fame
night to prifen of the Madelonette,
with hit grandfoa, Louis LepeHetier, at the
fame time that hit other grand children were
feparxted into different prisons. This sepa
ration proving extremely afflifting to him,
heearaefUy solicited against it, and at length
on bis repeated entreaties, they all met to
gether once more at Port Libre. They re
mained there but a (hort time. The son in
law of Malefherbes, the virtuous Lcpelletier
Rofambo, 'he firft of them who was arrett
ed, was ordered into another prison, and fa
crificcd a few days after. Malelhcrbes him
felf, his daughter, his grand daughter, and
her hufbarid, were soon sfter brought* to the
guillotine. ' They approached rt with for
titude and serenity. It was then tbyt his
daughtci addressed these pathetic words to
Madrmoifelle SÂ«mbreuil> who had favedthe
life of her own father on the 2d of Septem
ber: " You hi.ve had the exalted honour to
prcfcrve the life of your fatherâl have, at
least, the consolation to die with mine."
Malefherbes, (till the itait, even to hit
last moments-exhibited to his relations an ex
ample of fortitude. He cenrverfed with the
ps Â» a that were near him, without be
llowing the lead attention to the brutalities
ef the wretches who tied hit hands. As he
was leaving the prison to ascend the fatal
cart, he tumbled against a (lone, and made
a falfe step. " See," said he, smiling," how
bad an omen! A Roman in my situation
would have been sent back again." He
pa(Ted througlÂ»J > aris, ascended the fcaffold,.
and submitted to death with the fame un
(haken courage. He died at the age of fc
venty two years, four months, and fifteen
days. He had only two daughteis and the
son of one of them atone remains to succeed,
Louis Lapelletier, a young man of the fair
eft premise.

unnecessary confiimption of tine, as it
would not, he apprehended, change the o
pinion of any one. He hoped, therefore,
the question would be taken, without de
bate.
Mr. R. Williams did not mean to in
troduce a debate on tbii fubjeft, but merely
to (late the reafom which had induced him
in the feleft committee, and whieh would
induce him in ihit committee, and in the
House, to vote again'ft this Report. He
was as fully irilprcffed as any gentleman with
the neccffity of prcferving the digniiy and
honour of the house, and perfectly agreed
with gentlemen as to the propriety of an at
tention to order and decorum in all their
proceedings. But it appeared to him that
there was a previous confideratioa necessary.
It was necessary firft to conlider how far
the powers ef the house extended with rtf
peft to pu.'iifhiog its members, and whether
certain afts should be considered as done in
[ the house or out of it. When these gener
al principles were fettled, it would be easily
afeertaiaed haw far this power would ex
tend in the present cafe. He was of opin
ion that the powers of the house should be
eautioufly extended. This, be thought,
would be the opiniol of every member of
the eomOiittee, when they coafidered the na
ture and principles upoq which our laws
were founded, among# which it is a princi
pal feature, that the makers of a law frail
not have execution of it; another is, that all
offences (hall be declared by law, before s
ny person (hall be charged with coalmining
them. The laws are published, and Jnd
ges arc bouad down by rule, and every man
knows the law; but how is it m the present
cafe? The House of Reprcfentatives is the
injured party, the members are the Judges,
the Jurors, and the Exesutioaeis. He did
not mention this bteaufe he thought the
power of pur:idling its members was imylo
perly placed in tln'ir own body; he mention
ed it only to (hew, that the power was liable
to abufc from giving too much way to paf
fioo io,their proceedings.
Having made these remarks, he would
state, why he thought the bouse had not
the power to expel the member from Ver
mont. He did not believe that a member of
the Legislature could be expelled for any aft
done out of the House, except it rendered
him infannyis âMere lewdnefs, and breach
es of morjlity committed out of the House
the House sould not take cognizance of.
A member, out of the house, may do things
whichmayrenderhini very tofo
ciety, yet he may come into the House and
behave very orderly. His constituents
might have kuown, when they eleficd him
that be was fubjeft to fach behaviour, yet
they might have fufSeieat confidence in him
as a Representative 011 that floor; but if a
ny member afted so as to disturb the peace
and order of the House, they had, doubt
less, a right to turn him ouc.
Having mentioned what he conceived to
be theÂ«powera of the House, he would con
sider whether the aft done by the member
from Vermont could be considered as done
in the House, or in violation of its rules. If
he could persuade himfelf that it was done
when, the house was in order, in violation of
its rule, he should have no hesitation in fay
ing, the member ought to be expelled ;
fiÃce he fhculd take no notice of cj Sen five
words which had'been mentioned in jultifi
cation, for though this circumstance might
have cunfiderable weight with fame gtr.tie
'.en, it would have none with him. In the
rules for the regulation of the proceedings
of the House, it wa3 declared, that when
ever the House meets, the Speaker (hall take
the chair at the hour to which the House
had adjourned. But where, he asked was
'he Speaker, when the aft complained of,
was committed, and what was the fitnation
of the House at the time ? He did not mean
to fay that the Speaker, or any other mem
ber was not doing his duty, but to (hew that
the House was not in order. The Speaker
had left his feat, and was in that of another
member; and the members were palling to
and from different parts of the House. So
that if even it could be considered in such a
situation a3 that the rules of the House
would apply to it, some allowance ought to
be made to members who might think dif
ferently. But certainly no motion could
have been dated to the House in this situa
tion.
If the house had been organized,, the
Speaker could not haÂ»efuffcred fuchconver
fation as has been Hated to have taken place
before him. A braach of order, in such a
situation of things, therefore, could not de
serve expulfio|i. BeGdes, this tranfa&onhap
pened without the bar of the House which
according to the praftice vhicb had existed
since he had had a feat there, was never
considered as within the House, as ae mem
ber who was standing there when any que
stion was taken, was permitted to vote. And
he thought there was a great difference
betwixt a disorderly aft done in the House
and one done out of it. Two members
walking without the bar of the House, might
insult each other in a variety of ways, with
out disturbing the business of the House and
in such a cafe, he did not thing that they
would be liable to be expelled. If this were
so, it might be said members could not walk
together ; he did not fee this, for though
he would not agree to aa cxpulfion in faeh
a cafe, lit; thoiild think it J Cr io pusifh
the offender.
Mr. W. thought the cor.ftitution was
clear on this fubjeft. A bare majority may
punish a member, but the constitution has
declared that two-thirds of the members
present are neeeffary to expel a member.
The power of expullion is the higheti pu
nilhment the House can infiiit ; indeed it
is a punishment which not only goes to the
person and chara&rr of the member hiru
iein but it also affefts all the lutizens <Jf a
large diftrift of tountry, his constituents.
Being therefore to serious a power, as he
before Sated, it ought not ta be extended.
Trie House, has bo power over members out
of the House. If two members were to
quarrel and infnlt each other, out of the
Houfe,the House could take no cognixaaae
of the affair, except on a complaint made,
and in that safe, the offender could not be
expelled, but might be puoifhed. Snppofe
for instance, a meiaber of the House, and
aa individual who is aot a member were
ts quarrel out of the House, could the mem
ber coae to the house and complain of the
individual VvbÂ® is not a member ? Certainly
not, (ince the House had no power aver
that individual. Nor would * member be
pratefted from arrest 3nd process, were he
to commit any violent aft out of the House
which should make him liable to fueh a
process. He mentioned these inltaaccji to
Blew, that the House iftd not a right to ex
tend their privileges, but only to p rot eft
then.
These were the reasons, Mr. W. said,
whieh indueed him to think the member
from Vermont ought not ta be expelled;
not because he approved of his conduft, or
that the insult which he states to have beea
offered to him as warranting the improper
manner in which he resented it; not because
the house had not the power to expel it*
members, but because it was not in such a
fituatitm at the time as to authorize an ex
puUion for the offence, and that therefore
the perfoa offeudiiig/lid not know that any
such conference as an expulSon could be
punishment to which he was liable- But
though he was ajjainft an expylfion, jj C
ihould be in favour of fueh a punifliment ns
the House would have deemed proper, if
the offence had been committed without the
walls of the house.
Mr. W. said, there was another eircunt
ftanee which ought to be noticed. No*
application was made for the punishment of
this offence by the person offended ; but it
was taken up as a breach of the order of
the house.
Mr. Nbw hoped the question would be
taken without farther debate, as fufficient
time bad already been spent upon this fub
jeS.
Mr. Harper believed the candderations
upon which the vote now abont to be taken
presented themselves in fnch flrong colour*
to the minds of the members of this'com
mittee, and they would also fhoitly appear
so to the minds of the whole country, that
it sould not be neeeffary togo iKto a lengtby
discussion.on tlje testimony whieh had been
given 5 urn" was it neeeffary to go into an
answer to what hadifallen from the gentle
man from the gemieman from N. tarolina.
â Nothing more 'jiras wanted <m the preftnt
occasion, thai) t'ocall.the recolleaion-of the
committee to the following, which he took
te"bc the leading circftinftan'ces cafe.
â  . First, that a personal outrage of the very
groffeftand most indecent nature has Keen
committed by one member of the hcuffc u
pon anotherâan outrage which would not
hnve been tolerated it) any- tavern in the
country ; a perfoncomirmtisg which., would
have heen turned out of any eompauy, how.
ever little entitled to be called petite or gen
teel ; in no faciety could it have happened
without drawing upon it the contempt o<"
every fane present. This outrage was com
muted in the presence of the house, and in
the face of its deliberations. This had been
denied, and upon this ground the defence
is retted. But he asked if the house had not
beea called to order by the Speaker ; and
if it had, whether it had been adjourned >
It certainly had been called to order, and
had not been adjourned, and was therefore
ia leffion, Cnceit could not get out of that
Hate, w.thout an adjournment ; and tho'
it is true, that the Speaker bad left his
chair, y_t any member might have called
him so it, and introduced any motion to
the house. Besides he asked, whether count
ing the ballots for managers of the impeach
ment againll Mr. Blount, was not bufineft
of the house ? Or was it not the bufiitefs
of the house to read communications from
the President or tlir Heads of Departments''
It certainly was ; yet it was very common!
during the reading of such communications
for the Speaker ta leave his chair, and
members their feats. If the members of
the house were to be protested whilll ther
were engaged in one kind of business, and
not in another, it would be proper to make
a discrimination on the fubjea, and to fay,
what it the kind of bulinefs, in the tranf
adion of which its members fliall be pro
tested. r
But it was said, this affray happened
without the bar, and that the eognirancc
ot the house did not extend there. If this
were the cafe, any disorder might be com",
muted with impunity in the lobby or gal.
leries. Did not gtitflcmer* used to attend
Courts of Jiiftice know that the power of
j such Courts extended without as well aÂ«
within the bar ? Is one spot upon this floor,
said he, more the-houfe than the other ?
Ceriainly not. For if the oppafite doftrine
were true, no member would be liable to be
expelled, except he were to come icto the
J'-jM of a member and give him a blow.
But it was said, the Speaker ought tÂ©
have called the members to order who were
cor.rerling in the disorderly manner wliicji
had been stated j and because he failed ta
do so, it was said to be a proof that he did
not consider the house in order. But, if
j the Speaker had forgotten that the hoine 1
[ W4S Jn session ; or, if hj had doÃewroÂ»Â£in leaving His feat, (which he by ao meaas
thought) these circuirtftanees dÂ«d not put,
the houfc out of session ; for, if one me.u
bct were to knock another dawn, and the
Speaker did not call to order, face the houfc
once formed cannot he diflolved without a
formal vote, the houfc would not be less in
session than if the ft ri Ac ft order had bceu
kept.
Mr. H. said, lie ftould, like the gentle
man-from N. Carolina, omit noticing the
I provpeation said to be given to the geatlc-
I mail from Vermont. He believed that was
out of the question ; because, if the a &
complained of, had been in confequrnce of
a blow received, he would have had both
the gentlemen expelled ; or if the gentle
man from Omne&icut had given way to his
feelings and struck the membtr from Ver
mont to his feet, in return for the insult he
had received, in that cafe, he ftiould have
been Tor involving both in one sentence.
For, if this rule was oner departed from,
and provocation was to be set up as an apol
ogy for outrage, every person would be left
to judge in his own caufeas to the fufficien
cy c?f provocatioa. Thediftin&ionbet ween
viords and as perfotal attack, is a diftiac
tion r-ell understood. No language could
be fufficiently provokingto warrant a blow.
In well bfed society, when a man receives
an affront, does he knock down tfee person
giving it ? No ; he reprefTe# his feelings,
Â«Hid*Trtke> another time and place to obtain
jo ft Joe. And except the members of that
houfc were to conduct themselves in this
manner, they prostrate the barriers
which protesÂ«<d-decency of condu& among
them. He could not, therefore, believe
that any poflible provocation could eitheir
juftify or mitigate the adt of the gentleman
from Vermont. Indeed, if tbe provoca
tion was to be looked into, it would be
found to be all on the other fide.
From these confederations, he was so con
vinced of the propriety of agreeing to the
resolution before the committee,that he wa6
furprifedhow any perfoh could doubt a m - j
ment on the x fubje&. Indeed, if the cir-i
cumftdnce had happened without, instead of
within the walls of the house, he fhoulid
have thought it right to have expelled the
offender, as be held it to be one of those
anions which rendered a man unworthy of
a feat in that house.
A confidcrable cry for the question was
made.
Mr. Nic+iolas fa- he was willing to
have taken the quek. 11 upon this fubjeft,
without debate ; but it would be very im
| proper, indeed, to fuffer the observations
which had been made to pass without t no
tice. As it was too late in the day to en
ter upon a reply, he moved that the com
mittee might rife.
The committee rose and had leave to' fit
again..
The honfe having resumed, Mr. Sit
grbaves moved that the evidence which
had been, given to the committee, be prin
ted.âAgreed.

Mr. Livingflon, from the committee ef com
merce and manufaltares, made a report on the
petition of sundry proprietors and workers of
real mines, in the ftateof Virginia, who prayed
for a prohibition of the importation of coals-, or
an increase of duty, on that their
mines are fufficient for the cenfumption of the
United States. The committee report, that as
; voal is every day becoming more an article of
* the tfrit necessity, they do not think it would be
right to comply with the prayer of the petition,
especially as tie doty paid on exportation in
England rs taual to the firft cost of the coal,
an i a â¢duty of five cents a bushel is already paid
on its importation into this country.âCommit
ted for Monday.
The fame gentleman prefeated a petition from
the coach and chair-makers New-York, stat
ing that notwithstanding the duly which had

are yet imported without duty, by the persons
exporting then. Rating that they are second

this grievance. Referred so the committee of
of commerce and manufactures. r
Mr. Matthews presented the petition cf A
braham Millen, ia behalf of a claim due to his
brother William. Referred to the committee
j ef claims.
Mr. Harper said, he was under the uereffity
of perforroiag a very disagreeable duty ; '.t was
a duly, however, which he found hintfelf'bonad
â¢to perform, since no other member had thought
-proper to undertake it. It must be recollected,
he faidÂ»>y many members cf that house, that
the member from Vermont, whose very ex'raor
dinary rondod has been for some time the fub
jetft of dii'cwflion, ycfterdav, at the c*nelyfion of
jiis defence, made use of an exprtifion so outra
geoua, so gross, and indecent, thst gentle
men yet hid Icen able tc repeat it ; and if this
exprefficn could have been buried in silence, he,
for one, fltotiki have been in favour/ of its heing
fobuiied; but, unfortunately, this could not
be the ci/e, it had net only been h&fd by ma

he was authorised to fay, it was about to ap

1 At it could not, therefore, be kept from public
view it was neotflary to take furh notice of it,
as it deferred. Before he made it the fubjelt of

was referred to the committee of the whole to
whom was referred the report of the committee
of privileges. The queflien for this re ereuce
was carried by the caftjng vote of the i'peaker,
there being 43 votes for it, and 43 votes agiinft
it.
The house # hen again resolved itfclf into a

by Mr. Shepard, in favour of the reJ'dution.â
He was followed by Mr. Nicholas againfl it

after some debate 48 to 43-
The amendment being incorporated wi h
the resolution, Mr. Gallatin fpokc againk

Mr. Morris (of Vermont) only rose to ob
serve that the member from Vermont ( Mr. Ly
on) in tlte courl'c of his defence of yefterdav,
stated that on a former octafion he was irifulred
by a fenVor from Vermont (Mr
who gave his test mony before this committee,
and that he had chastised that gentleman for it-
It is my duty to declare that this assertion is ab
solutely falfeâThat 1 havfe the hoanr of the
senator's.acquaintance for many yearsâthat he
is highly rel'pe<sled in his own country as ajjen
tleman of learning, abilities and integrityâthat
he was an officer in the American army, saw
atfual service, and acquitted himfelf like a brave
man-
There seemed to be a great desire, very loud
ly exprrfled, that the quefuon should be takea
before the committee rose ; but Mr. Sswall and
Mr. Rutledge, both appearing to have a desire
to speak to the fubjÂ«tf, and it being near four
o'clock, the committee rose* and had leave te
fit again.
Just before the committee rpfe, the chairman
informed the committee he had received a let
ter from Mr. Chipman, of the fen ate, in confe
quenre of what had fallen from Mr. Lyon, in
his defence of yefterd ty. The letter was re
quefled to be read, and wis as follows :
SIR,
I feel it my duty, in this public manner, to vin
dicate myfeif against fn unwarranted attackon my
charaiier, by Mr. Lyon, yesterday, in the house

that he had once chastised me publicly fÂ«r an af

Mr. Lyon's is without foundationâlt is falfeâ
Nor can I eonje&ure to what eircumftance Mr.
Lyon could have alluded, unless it might be a lu

representatives, requeued me; tho* not a member,
to examine and report my opinion concerning cer
tain debts due from persons whose estates had been
confiscatedâl had made a report accordingly, at
some part of which Mr. Lyon took offence. One
morning Mr. Lyon called at Mr. Bradley's room,
in wh eh I was then doing bafinefs. No person

what irritated, and in a very rude and pointed
manner declared that ao man who had a spark of

MR. CO IT
came forward to day with a defence for Ly- g
on broad enough to juftify ot excuse all the
indecency and insult he hat already been
guilty of, and all he can possibly hereafter
cmaamit. Lyon in the caurfr ofWt defence
of the contempt and outrage now charged f;
ahd proved againfl him, instead of exhibit- â ]
ing that deep fenfeof ffiame >and contrition d
hit conduft calls for, expressed himfelf with h
fleady and unchaaging impudence and dif- I
regard to that decency and order he had so n
grossly violated ; and concluded his de
fence with an observation couched in lau- 1 ; s
guage, that would have procured him an
iuftantaneous kicking from any decent com- Â£
pany, and an" expHlfion from any modefl a
' body. When the house was called upon to 1
resent this language, too indelicate ever' to
be stated, or as Mr. Dayton observed to h
be found in the mouth of any gentleman,'' f,
Mr. Coit endeavored in vain by hit vote to 0
preveot its coming into notice at all. But ! b
as this point was carried againfl him, he tl
flood up, in the committee of the whole, tl
the rnoft extravagant advocate for Lyon, h
that has appeared in the whole course c f the -
enquiry. He stated that the house ought
for its own dignity to presume Mr. Lyon let fait
the off five exprefftons from inadvertency and
hajle. Lyon rises to deliver a premeditated,
prepared and written speech, which he con
cludes with a grofÃ and vulgar insult te the
house, and every gentleman in it; spoken a
in a loud, audible and diflihfl voice, heard o
in the gal'ery and to the utmost extremes w
of the Hall: and yet Mr. Coit would ex- e
cufe and pass this affront by in filenor as an w
inadvertence-, and this too, forth e dignity as e
the house. Pray why (hould not Mr. Grif- tl
wold, for his dignity presume Lyon spit in si
hit face by inadvertency ? And whyfhould h
notvthe house excuse that offence on the e.
fame ground ? It would be much more r<-a- ii
fonable than in the last cafe. Thit affront '1
to Mr. Grifwold was given in a heated and g
hasty personal altercation ; the lafl i* a pre- tl
meditated defence. If such extenuations o
are to be admitted, order and decency are b
done away, " and chaos it come again." f<
Mr. Coit it probably ambitious to defervc |<
and receive anether applauding and congrat
ulatory addrefsfrom the democratic papers, tl
on his return home ;* at it was by fruftrat- a
ing and embarraÃing the views of federal a
men and federal measures, he acquired it at t.
the lafl feflion : or perhaps he feels grateful I
to Mr. Lyon, forcxcepting him from the p
chargft of corruption he htaptd on the t
Connecticut delegation j and kindly prom- n
ifing that when he {lull fe* about to turn t
out the representatives front that. Hate, hÂ»
will spare Mr. Coit from the general ruin, f
and permit him to come again. It is high- g
ly gratifying, that not a single federal man a
joined Mr. Coit in this extraordinary de- c
fence, and even some of the democrats were
ashamed of it. Certain it it, he has goae c
beyond the worfl of them ia eflablifhing a <
(landing defence for all indtcency, and in t
exculpating Lyon's offence in the firfl as 1
well as the lecond in fiance. <

The Sublcriber, late captain of the brig
Nancy of this port, having in a voyage to
the Welt-Indies, experienced the Jalutary ;
effeSt of a patent machine, for ventilating
the holds of (hips at sea, invented by Mr.
Benjamin Wynkoop, and conllructed in said
brig ; doth certify, that the said machine,
worked by the moyon of the vrfTcl at sea,
forced a conftaut current of pure air into
the hold, from whence the foul air was there
by expelled, that the seamen were ttmark
ably healthy, when the crews ef molt of
the other veffclt, at the port where the said
brig discharged her cargo, were veryfickly
and ma.iy of them died, no difagrteablc
smell was perceived from the provilions or
bilge waterâthe vessel's Sores and particu
larly the liquors, were better preserved and
cooler than common, and the paint in the
cabin not difcgloured as usual in Well-1 nd a
voyages. As a friend to trade and naviga
tion, the Subscriber thinks it is his duty,
to recommend this machine to general usÂ»,
and from the fails as stated above, he fully
believes it may be the means of preferring
the timber Â»f (hips, and their perilhable
cargoes, from the definitive effedls of foul
air, confined in the holds of ships, and of
contributiug to thf health and comfort of
the paflengers and seamen on board.

CONFLAGRATION.
Yesterday afternoon, about four o'clock,
a fire broke out in one of the drefling-rooms
of the Theatre in FederaUflrcetâand such
was the height of the flames before discover
ed. and such the nature of the cembuftiblcs
which they firfl took hold of, that 110 ex
ertions of several of the attendants of the
theatre could check theirprogrefs; and be
fore seven o'clock the intire inside of per
haps the mod elegant building in the Unit
ed States was totally destroyedânothing be
ing left unconfumed but the brick walls.â
The property loft on this occasion is very
great ; but fortunately such was the (late of
the wind, and the a&ivity and intelligence
of the citizens present, that the adjacent
buildings, though all of them of "wood, and
fame of them very near, were not in ths
lead damaged.
We have taken some pains to ascertain
the eaufe of the deflruttionâRumour, ever
adlive, and almost forever erroneous, readily
attributed it to a rthearfalof the Jhm-iuorls
to b* exhibited in the pantomine of Don
Juan; but we have, from the evidence of
persons on the fjpot, ascertained, that it is
to be attributed wholly to accident; or the
negligence of the fervaut whofeduty it waa
to watch the fires in the drefling-rooms.
Only one share of the property was in
sured; when we contemplate the ele
gance of the bnildiÃgâthe beauty of the
architeflure and other ornaments, we mifll
deplore the loss as a public injury.
Great credit is due to our worthy fellow
citizens of Charlejlotvn, Roxbury,Dorchejicr,
Cambridge, and other idjicetit towns, for
their indefatigable aftivity in aftifling to flop
theprogreftofthe flames which on the firfl dis
covery were alarming, and which with al
mofl auy other people, would have tarried
definition far and wide.
