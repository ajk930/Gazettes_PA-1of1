, "â¢ The French transports ran into the Nile,
and Buonaparte landed with ouly a few day 3
provisions on hand, with about thirty eight 1
thousand men, two thousand having betn r
cut to pieces on attempt,to laud at Alexan- 3
, dria, wtiere they expe&ec a paflive reception. f
! The lall dispatches Itate, that the only sup. j
j plies Buonaparte could get were a little rice
. and water, brought to him on camels by the .
I Arabs, but that the Turks were taking mea- 1
. fures, not only to cut off this fcccour, but v
, to march againlt htm. 3
'I he crew of the Timeleon, when the ship v
took fire, attempted to save themselves on v
| fiiore, but were all cut to pieces. The !
L'Orient's people were in part, destroyed
in the fame manner, and blown up, only a 1
few escaped, prahaps into the woods te v

[We further learn by Mr. Yates who ji

1 wa# favored by Admiral Jervis {limfelf with '
the official particulars above related, that
none of the transports were destroyed, hav- a
ing probably run up the bay of Rofetta in- c
to shallow water, and that nothing certain "

able ; and above all, pressed on every fide C
by hordes of Saracens, too barbarous to be 0
worked upon even by French delusion. e
The forebodings of the invader must for- '

j require our sices in the Field, avail, with ac
alacrity, of favorable an oppor'unity to ar
expref* our itiments of the present im- VV
portant crilisnd which we have the plea
. sure to afluresu are unauimous.
Well knovg the advantages and bless- '^ r

< all nations. ' approve of the measures aii
} which ha*e en taken for that purpose P'
s with refpedt \prance, and which we anrf
, iou/ly hopedrould be effefltial ; but we a
I have fecn eve effort of onr Government f 0
treated with 4tempt: Not only one En- ci
# vtJy rejefted w(i ignotpiny and disdain. but
more solemn nbaffy of three not futfered '
. even to negocje, and a naiferr.ble attempt
j made, after va y trying to reduce them to

be weak enougto be deceived) into an in-

our couniry foirer. f<
We have noeafon to believe that our
Government habeen in any fault, (and are
perfeÂ£lly convincd that it has not b>;en so l !
inter.tignally) ; jus as it magnaaimondy, ;N
and with a noblefetfe of duty, offered a fair c
difcuflion of this lÂ»jeÂ£t, and reparation if b

~fider the treatJien our Public Ministers 1
have received the highest indignity that c
Could be offered toaur country, th* moll Â®
open defiance the cenmon sense of mankind j

that they possessed iews which they dared

In this situation, therefore, insulted as our '

the exertions of our couatry itl this great
conjunfture, are to be condufted under the
auspices of a Statesman who has so emi

ANSWER.
To the Officer! and Soldiers of the Regiment of
Militia in the county of Cbo van in theÃate
of North-Carolina.
Gentlemen,
YOUR unanimous address at Edenton
of the fourth of September, has been trans
mitted to me by Richard Benburv, Esq.
your brigadier general.
After a solemn embafly of three envoys
had been denied an opportunity to negoci- j
ate, the miserable attempt to divide them ]
from each other, and carry on a delusive |
shew of negotiation, for the purpose of ef- j
fefting divisions in our country, was too I
mean and contemptible to impose upon the j
credulity of any true hearted American.'
I rejoice in the opportunity of congratula
ting you, on the ill fuccef. of that wretch
ed artifiee, both with the pfcople of Ame
rica and with the envoys, who are now all
happily returned to their country.
(Signed)

LONDON, September 27. 1
The Pjiris papers having been the firft to
gite an account of the battle betw:en the !
Britifli and French fleets, and .that intelli- 1
1 jence being confirmed by another account '
received from our minider at Conflantinople, '
does away all doubt of an adtioij having
taken place. ' Mr. Smith, hav'ng the bed J
means of information, -would not deceive 1
our court, or lie i-iimfelf deceived : he mud '
have had the mod politive belief of the faft
before tie tranfmittcd it to government ; 1
and adminiftratioÃ mall have had an entire 1
rclirnce upon its truth, before they publtfh- I
â Â«d the intelligence in the (hapc of an official '
hul'etin. '
The following, w ich is an extraft of a '
private letter from Constantinople, dated '
Aug. 21, seems to give a t/iorv minute ac- !
count o- Buonaparte's landing in Egypt,
than ar\ we have betore received : 1
Â«Ti rtlgy He Divan been previously 1
informed Of tiie French intending to invade 1
Egypt /e t by many of its members this 1
\ report was deemed a mere fidian. inve -ted 1
10 diflurb the good un-lerllanding which '
lias so 10-ig fubfitled between the Ottoman 1
Porte a>d France. Their aftonilhment was '
therefore extreme, wh'.n they were officially '
irquainted with thd FrÂ«>ch hasring adually 1
effected a drfrent near Alexandria. The j 1
particulars of 1 hi# event are as follow :
" The Toision flee:, having for some
l.roe cniiled in the /\rchipÂ»lagÂ», appeared
before Alexandria, and the Frei.ch demand- '
ed to be received as friends. The muflel
man, wlto commanded in that city, made
Â»trytlrong lemoni'.ratices agaiull their pio
jefted landing, endeavouring to convince
that any attempt of that kiild would
he confidcrsd as an attack *n the right of
i>Â»vertigniy of the Grand Seignior, 011 the
privileges of the coutfiry, and on the tran-
quillity and fafety Â»>f tiie ni'ubilaiUs. Bat j
â¢â¢11 hit rerr.onflra -res proved fruitlfss : the j in
French lande i in different piaces about cc
22 000 men, notwithftandiig the refillance th
made y the Egyptian tro ps. and the in- of
habitants of the country
"Two days after,the French intending to R
occupv a pod to the right of Alexandria
towards Rofctta they were surprised by a th
corps of about 6000 Egyptian horfe,,and Wi
some th Mifand foot, commanded by a Bey zc
who e ijoycd the reputation of a brave and 'e
gallant soldier. The engagement laded a
few hour!,' and the Bey was forced 10 re- . a ., (
treat wit l, Jersble loss, though the vei
French fufferci likewise considerably j and
their loss was more frvercly felt, as they Â® ! i(
were unable to repair it. This aftion con- ,h,
vinced Buonaparte of the fentiuieiits of re
fped entertained for him by the Arabs, and
1 by the Egyptian troops He called a coun
cil of War, the reful of which was, to ad- ~
" vance beyond Rofetta, and to entrench him
felf about 10 or t2 leagues from that town,
on the banks of the Canal which leads to 1
C;iiro. 111 thN position, he IfTued a procla
mation, and endeavoured to f*t on foot a
negotiation with the Beys, who, howtver,
pi-remptorily rrfufed ro treat with him, but, w
infilled on his r embarkiHg hi troops, and
qaitiing th dominions of the Grand Seig
nÂ° r -
" In thi,' fnuation were the affairs of E-
gvpt on the departure of the lad acconnts n,
received fiom that counlty. B
" In our cty we heari ot" nothing but
war, though no declaration to that effect
has as yet b en iflued by our government. â
The most vigorous Wrirlik-.' preparations are,
however, made both by sea and land. Un- q,
der these - ircumHanccs, the French Charge
d'affaires, as wtll as the other French citi-
1 zens residing hcte, keep at home, lead they
I fh vild be imtilitd by the mob."
The Hamburgh ma l has brought an ar
ticle of information, which though not of
, the very firll importance, is nevertheless a
- "ery curious prcduflion a proclamation if n(
- sued by Buonaparte, which is a mailer piece
1 of revolutionary hypoctify. This general
s lalt year profeifed the utmod refpeft for the c<
r '-'ope, though at the fame timt he robbed
s him of his dominions; las now declares
j " that he henovrt the Prophet and hii holy c '
1 Koran," at the very- moment that h.2 invades 0
e the country inhabited by his mod zealous
t followers, and mod fervent But
1 so far from his hypocritical proclamation a
s hiving made the lead impression on the cc
. Turks, favourable to the republican adven
t turers, the mod vigorous prepuations are
r made throughout the Turkish dominions to
' check their further progress. It is ihere
t fore undeniable that he finds himfelf in an
. t hÂ°^ e country, where he is likely to meet
with obdacles far more numerous and infur
t mouncable than he expefted.
s It will be recollected thatgen. Buonaparte
previous to his quitting Italy, gave a Con
ilitution to the Cisalpine republic. The
French Direiftory, it would seem, is now
1 resolved to take advantage of his absence to
r dedroy his work by the agcncjrofM.TTOTrve
: the DireStorlal Envoy at Milan. The eon
. (titutional party of the Legislative Body 31
, has feat gsn. Lahoz to Paris to oppose the w
e innovations intended by Tiouve, who in a
' letter to the Directory, has dtsounced the "
e manoeuvres of the ambassador, ,aad com
- plained of a handful of ruffians holding regu
, lar meetings in tie house of citizen Ti ouve.-
I- Instead of receiving any fort / fat! faction,
1, Lahoz was ordered to quit Paris within
i- I wmty-four hours.
Lucien Buonaparte, at the head of the a
anti dire&orial party in the Council of Five
Hundred, has el'.qu:ntly defended the work j
if of his brother. .On a late motion of order, ;
le he founded the toc/in, againd the dif ofitions v
1- of Government, which under the specious | I
is name of reform, evidently drove to bring on I
ruin He said, the French conflitution it- j 1
r fclfwas threatened with similar innovations, |
it by the Dire&ory, and on the point of being : '
: overthrown in the fame manner. Altnod ' t
le all the members demanded that his speech t
le should be printed ; the devotees of the '
ic Directory fucceed<d In caiiting the comic 1 '
to be resolved into a secret committee, in - '
which Buonaparte's motion was disposed of ]
by the order of the day.
