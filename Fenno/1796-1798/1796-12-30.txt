Patrick Moore, of the city of Philadelphia merchants,
trading under the firm of Blair M'Clenachan and P,.
Moore, and from Blair M'Clenachan in his separate
capacity i to which, by the laws of the land, all the
joint as well as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it it clcarly and fatisfaÂ«Slorily afccrtained, that mr.
Blmr M'Clenachan, of the laid firm, has conveyed
away to Mir. John H. Hujlon, his foil-in law, to hit
daughter, mil's M'Clenachan, and to his son, George
M'Clenachan, several large and valuable real (estates,
as well as eoitfiderable personal property, in the city
and county of Philadelphia, in ths county of Lancas
ter, in the county of New-Castle on Delaware, and
eifewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to.de"
feat the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts.â
This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons wliomfoÂ»

' TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public printj,
warning all persons purcbaGng from the
grantees ef Blair M'Cletoachan, any portion of the
H large, teal and personal estates he conveyid away to
n his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation hod upon thefubjeft by a general and
_ numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P Moore as of Blair M'Clena
ehan individual!j. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trull confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors i a ftcp which it would have been a
â breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted,
d The very ftatomeat of the fait therefore mull dif
â > pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
!* or vindictive." It originated in a desire to secure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
[e ment of his just debts. It was fanftiened by the
" advice ot council as a measure necejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advernlcment has been
le injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
,e to his ovrn unjufliliable corduft, not to the iub
d fciibers who have merely publidied the truth in
g terms as mild as the fact would admit, and who
al mean to investigate in a high court of justice .the
validity of those purcbafes of which Mr. M'Cle
js naehan so confidently fpcaks.
d The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in genetalto repeat their
1 ," eaution against ptirchafing df those grantee* or
,* either of them, and to extend the terms of it tÂ» h
at purchase from any other perfong (if such there be)
0 to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
at.

CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, December 26.
[continÂ»EÂ»t]
Mr. Nicholas fa id lie had not been convinced "by
the observation* of gentlemen wba had fpuken is
. favout of this report.; thit all the mifchiefs would
[ not follow thil measure which he before predicted
He enquired into the purpose of establishing a na
tional university. The President had said, and the
commiffieners after him, it was to efUblifk an uni
formity of principle* and nanners throughout the
union. This, he believed, could not be effected by
any iiillitation. If, said he, yeu incorporate men
to build an university, aie you not pledging your
felvn that you will makeup any deficiency ? And
as the building mult be commensurate with the ob
ject, they would hare an enormous empty house
continually calling upon them for contribution* to
its support. Whatever moderation had been obferv.
Ed in framing this report, Mr. N. said, it was like
many others which came before themâit was so
covered, as not to (hew half the mifchiefs which
woald attend it. If a plan of education was want
ed for tha' didri&, let members from that part Â«f
the country fay so, and he would be ready to af
ford them every ncceflary a ft,lance s but he would
not think of going into the scheme of a national
university.
Thediftriftof country from whence he came,
mi(,'ht Rand in great need of femioarie* of learning
as had been hinted by the gentleman from Mary,
'and (Mr. Craik) but their ignorance nauft conti
nue, u'ltil they were sensible of their want of ia-
Rm&ion. He believed there was no federal quality
in knowledge, and no federal aid was neeeffary to
the Ipread of it. Every diftrift of countiy was
â  competent to provide for the education of its own
citizens ; and be should not give his countenance
to the national plan proposed, beeaufe the eipence
would be enormous, and beeaufe he did not think
it would be attended with any good effect, but
with tnu.-k evil.
Mr. R. Sprigg, jun. eonfidered the report before
them as of a vrry harmlef* nature. The President,
he said, bad appropriated land upon which to erect
the niiiverlity in queftioa. They were not called
upon to fanftion that appropriation. His power
to give it was foil and ample. The thing was done,
and he had promised a future donation. The ap
prehenGons of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
Nicholas) fcemed to arise from his conceiving they
were about to fanftion a national university fueh as
had been recommended by the PreHdent; if this
were the cafe, although the reprefeil'ative of that
didrift, he should not give his vote in fopport of
the measure. On the contrary, he iaid, tbey were
called upon merely to authorise proper perfous to
receive donations for an university. .What fort of
indention this should be, would he for the future
consideration of Congref*. Mr. S. said, he (hoald
always be ready to give his fuppott to every mea
sure which had a tendency to spread knowledge
throughout the United States, as he believed the
progress of knowledge <nd liberty Kould accompa
ny each other. The gentleman from Virginia
feeined to think this inftitation would only benefit
a small circle. He did not think the iate of Ma
ryland would be much benefitted by it, as they had
already two good universities, bÂ»t he thought it
doing no more than) justice to the owners of pro
perty in the federal city, that this institution diould
be encouraged. What was aflted ot them, would
not commit them at all for any thing forfher; and
it would be a mean of taming the attention *4 the
people to the support of an inftitutiou of this kind.
For these reasons, he hoped the hoafe would agree
to the rvport.
Mr, Livingfton said, he was in favour of tke re
port of the committee, until, by a recurrent* to
the aft for eftablifliing the permanent feat of gov
ernment, he was convinced there was something
more in thÂ» measure than met the eye. The inten
tion seemed a good one, but what hindered the
(late in which this diftrift lay, from granting tke
incorporation desired i There needed to have been
no ditficulty in this. But something farther was
intendedâpublic patronage was wanted to the in.
dilution. They were delired, at a minute's warn
ing, to fay they would establish a national universi
ty- It was true, they had been called by a respec
table authority to do this ; but it was a matter of
moment, and required consideration. How far
the commissioners were aathorifed to give land for
this purpose, he conld not fay. He thought the
words " public use,'' would not authorise them to
do so: for if they gave land upon which to erect
an university, they might K ive it for any other
building which was to be enjoyed by a number of
people ; for school* and uniferfities, he said, were
not public, put piivste concerns. The effect of
the resolution would be, as had been justly said, an
entering wedge ; and hereafter they should be toldt
they must go on, and all the fine things which had
now been urged, would then be brought forward,
with ten fold force, in favour Â®f a national univer.
Gty. If this kufiuefs was perfectly hairalefs, as it
had been represented, he should willingly have sup
ported it : but, as he conceived it to be far other
wifr, be conld not vote for it.
Mr. Madifsn was far from thinking that this
was a quedion which went to pledge Congress
support a national university. He did not think
the agreeing to the present proposition would pledge
Congress to pay a Angle farthing. He eonfidered
thÂ« qneftion merely to be whether Congress would
encourage an eftablifliment which was to be sup
ported independent of them. The Prefideat had
thought proper to give to this inttiiution the fifty
(hares in the Potomac navigation, which had been
prefer,ted to him as an acknowledgment of his fÂ«r
vices during the war, but which he declined ac
cepting for his own use. All that the commilW
ers prayed for was to have this property secured,
with any other which might be given for the fame
purpose, by grar ting due poweis for the pisrpofe.
This was the simple view which he had of the fob
jeft. The gentleman ftom New York (Mr. Li
virgfton) firmed to think there was no necefiity
for the interference of the United States in this
bufinefj. Mr. M. laid Ccogufs had th ' fote jurif-'
uiflion over this diftrift of country. It w.is indeeJ
necefTary that the laws of Maryland (hrjuld operate
over it for the prefem, but they do so, said lie, by
authority of Congreic, and CoÃÂ«refs only can <aake
j a law on the present fubjeft. With this idea, the
commiflioiters had applied to them. The report
before them, Mr. M. said, did not call the univer
sity a national aniverlity ; it fpÂ£aks of it as an uni
verftry in the diftridi of Columbia. He thaugbt
there was a material difference between calling it
an univerlity and a national aniverfity. Congress,
he said, might form an institution there, which
could not be confidercd an inllitution of the Unit
ed States, which Heverthcicfs, have all the
good of a national inHitununâand it was in this
qualified light in which he viewed it.
Mr. R. Sprigs, jun. said it had_becn enquired
why the Legiflaturc Â»f Maryland couli not have
â  granted the what they now pray for
He answered they coald make no law for that oif
tridt which fttnuld extend pad the time at whivh
the feat of government was to be removed there.
H: mentioned some inflancci which had taken
place whilll he was a member of that legiflaturc.
This, he said, accounted for the application of the
; commiflioners ta Congress.
On motion, the committee rose, and had leave
to fit again.
Mr. Ckriii* exprefied mueh diflatisfafiion with
the fcttlciaent which had been made at the war of
fice in relation te the accounts of captain Robert
Harris, wha had only been credited with f.x'een
dollars for eighteen mouths fervise, owing to his
not having called at the precise time for payment
at which he oaght to have eallci. He therefare
moved a resolution calling upon the war department
far a statement as the number of officers aad the
amount of tbeir pay who flood ex;tsly in e,iptain
Harris's fituatian, in order to fliew no great in
convenience waald arise from a re fettlcmerit. Af
ter a number as ablvrvations on the fubjeft, the
motion was negatived.
Mr. Nicholas obtained leave of abfrnee for Mr.
Hefcth, for 20 days.
Mr. Parker laid a resolution to the following ef
fect upon the table':
" Aefolved, that the President of the United
States be requested ta cause to be laid before the
house, what measures have been taken for carrying
into effect the treaty between the Uaited States
and the Dey and Regency of Algiers, and also
whether aay aad what further legislative aid may
be for thai purpafe."

ferred the report of the attorney-general on this
fubjefl. ' *
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of claims
made report* on the petitions of Gilbert Deach,
Thomas Miller, Thomas Curtis, Joseph Shalk,
James M'Calmant and Ricnara Keys Theie re
ports were all against the petitioners, were several
ly twice read, aad concurred in by the house.
| Mr. Swanwick, from the committee of com

They were twice read, and (except the two lalt,

Mr. Hartley presented the petition of Robert

The order Â»f the day was eallcd for on the re
port of the committee to whore was referred the
memorial of the commiflioners of the Federal city,
and that part of the President's fpecch, which re
ferred ta the cftablifhtnent of a national Hniverlity.
The house accordingly resolved itfe'.f into a com
mittee of the whole ou that fubjeft, Mr. Coit in
the chair, when, the resolution, reported by the
felcift committee, having been read, no gentleman
rifiug on the subjeCt, the chairman enquired if Jie
committee were ready- for the qucllion, "and, 011
being answered in the affirmative, the queilion was
put and negatived by a great majority.
The committee then rose, and thf house took
up thefubje&, whea
Mr. Murray exprcfTed his surprise at the decifi
an which had just taken place. He thought the
question mud have been mistaken, or it had not
been fufficiemly di feu fled. He regretted deeply
that a fubjeft so intereftirig should have had so lit
tle confederation. The report of the committee, he
said, was moderate and just, and he coufefTed he
bad heard nothing from gentlemen, who were op
posed to it, that was not either founded ia millskes,
or in an overheated imagination of evils, with
which the repart was unconnected. One would
have supposed, said he, to have heard the argu
ments used oh the eccafion, that the report had
propafed ta lay the foundation of a national uni
versity, which should have called far rofeurces from
the whole unian. On looking iuta the report, he
faund na such thing ; in referring to the memorial
of the commtifioncrs, aethivg like it was to be dif
coveted ; the i-eqieft was (imply *St,t Congrcft
would do, what Congress alone ceulii do, viz. au
ihoi ife proper persons lÂ« receive f*ch rfoÂ«ition< a*
liber?) and well difpttfed perfo'-s might be inrltucd
to give towards carrying into effefl the iaftitatiort
of an tsmverlity. Yet the rote of the commi'tee
of the whole jaft taken, weat te crush thi* perfect
ly harmless, but desirable measureââ¢ measure
which went to the planting a little feed of learn
ing is that diftrift. It aflced neither for.protedi
en nor bounty from the United States ; it requited
nothing mote than the liÂ«ip!ea&of incorporatiÂ»n.
HiÂ»colleague (Mr. Sprigg) he said, had ihcwn that
the legislature of Maryland could not grant the in
corporating power wanted, iince they did not ex
tend their power beyoud the period of lÃoe, at
which tiaae iht general gjveruÂ»eul waj k) be si..cd
withia that diftrift.
If CÂ»Â»grefs refufe to comply with the request of the
petitioners, laid Mr. M.tkey will smother In the Snd
the efforts of individual!, incline 1 1te give donations for
the encouragement of learning in this new c.jty. SiÂ»
ungenerous a resolution ke could not have believed
pafful a body, who had the ckaraAer of
liberal and enlightenedâsuch a vote would appear
particularly humiliating in the eyes of foreign nations.
Where, he alked, would be the evil of agreeing tÂ»
the report ! We could fee none. The Pi cfiaeut had
generously fignified hit intention of giving about the
valueof 5,0001. sterling, and the write <tnu liberal in
all parts of the Union would probably follow hia ex
ample. A seminary 01 learning would be let about,
proportioned to the resources for its support. ln
ftead of allowing thiÂ» to be the cafe, every puffible
abuse had been imagiaed to take plate -y was t<k
be extravagantly lquandered, a large vu
te he eredled, and Corigrefs waÂ» to be called upon tÂ»
complete tke defifn. Why, ke said, fuppei'e ail this
abuse ? Wai it' not more probable, that enlightened
men, desirous of promoting fwch an inititutiou would
a<fti a more prudent and rational part, -particularly
when~thc law held out to them no idea of support f
Upon the whole, he thought no reasonable ohjeAion
could be made to the report j he keped a final dei if.
ion therefore would be delayed; for he could not be*
litvt, when gentlemen took time to confidcr the fuis
| je<!t, they could aA so unenlightened and illiberal a
j part as to rejid a request so harmless and reasonable.
Mr. MadilÂ«H propol'ed to strike out the word pecu
niary trom the report, that the expression might ex
tend to all lortl i>f donations.
The Speaker said it Was net in order to amend the
report in that ft&ge of the hufinefs. '!'Â» amead it, tke
I report must be recommitted.

COMMUNICATIONS.
Mr. Fekno,
The following article appeared in the Aurora
yeflerday.
Such an open avownl of the wijiei of those da
rr.eflic traitors whether native or foreign, whose ma
chinations threaten to involve out country in war
and bluod, has scarcely before appeared. On the
principles heie advanced, it is the duty of our ci
ti*Â«ns to invite a foreign power to take the United
States into keeping. What panders of prostitution
would the Jacobin faction prove, could they but
once debauvn the people of this country, and de
fttoy their â¢' sslf respf.ct." ' C.
ExtraS from tie Aurora, â 
" Attempts are made te fprcad alarms refpeft
ing Louisiana, as if the possession of that country
iiy Fiance would sot be of the utmost advantage
considered in every relation ; firft as an exemplary
warning agaicft the growing spirit of arifltcracy
among us; fecoudly as an aid agaiaft the wicked
arts of Britain to entrap us into an ejffeujivc and
difcnfive alliance ; and third as a fafe and >ec afy
lum trom tyranny in the event of the majority â¢{
ourMlow cniÂ«enÂ» being betrayed inta fa diabolical
â¢â¢n alliance, in so a tame a futTender of republican
freedom at the feet ot arijltcracy and kingly pa
f; eantry !"
WastverMiy country, Poland excepted, so abo
minibly ini'ulted at our own ? A foreign miaifter cotnifs
here and levies war, while the government and the na
ton pcoelaim neutrality. Another tarns his back on
the cunftituted authorities and his impudent face to the
people j yet while he pretends to coax he dareÂ« to
threaten and on* voicc as indigattian is raised
against him. Heedless of that voice, the hired press of
the rainifter audatiouily declares that the French will
afford an asylum in Louisiana for perfccutcd patriotsâ
such no doubt as David Bradford. Aad that a French
army marching through .the United States would not
do much mifchicf. In the Aurora we read, with pro
per edification, the threats of an American citizen,
commander of two French (hips, against his country,
if we ehufe Adams Prefidcnt. The Boils* Chronicle,
to cover the whole, ealls our difpofitien towards France
rebellious. What kind of malleable ijuff do theft
infulters imagine the American nation are made of h
Every American who laves hit country well,
readil* acknowledges that aur very Dear Allies
for four years past, and at the present time, give
undeniable proofs of their being our very dear al
,lieÂ«, if the fpaliations M our Cemaurcc- to the
amount of 4 ir. illions of dollars are any evidenceâ
yet this is the nation, that talks of tieing the bands
of Friendship more clafely, this is the nation which
the Genetifed, mongrelifed amerieans fay ought te
be laved better than our awnâA very clear sample
of Loveâbut a piratical way of (hewing it, this
is like a lover eourting his mistress to ileal her Jew
els âIf the French King loved us well enough to
lend us Eiyht millions aad the Directory well
enough to difpoil by their ardeis our merchants of
foui millionsâto which ought our Gratitude to
ilahdf the King or llie terrible reputlitâ
Gratitude as per Favour.
In a paragraph in the Aurota of WednefSay,
which contains as many falsehoods as could well be
conpreflcd within its limits, it is said, that " the
JirJl French art'ijls arc employed in the trahfportation
of the statues and pi&ures front Italy and this
is almoÃ the only palliative offeted to foften the
criminality of the plunder. How abundant soever
auiils may have been in France, the revolution has
operated as an ostracism ta them, which few have
escaped. But if they have the firft artifls, that is
te fay, packers, waggon-drivers, See. to emplay
for this puvpofe, their conduct, with regard to-the
whole tranfaihon, will remain the fame i. and (in
the opinion of the be& men in France) wherever
the trophies arc exhibited, they will be regarded
as monuments of disgrace arid infamyâThey will
pr*ve a beacan to warn the nations of the earth
from any connexion or intercourse with the French ;
till at length, tired and finking under the intolera
ble load of infamy, they will, as' the only means
left to retrieve the honor of the Ftench-name,
tranfpovt back again, their ill gotten plunder ; and
instead Â«f korfcrwr mules, they will cause the pic
| tures an(? ftatwej to be li-trmfpoMed by tbe base
I inlhuments of their deportation.âAnd God fend,
â  'hat citizen Buonaparte may live to be one of the
! train.
