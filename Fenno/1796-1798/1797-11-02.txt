Di. William Currie.
sir,
I (hall now enter into a full examina
tion of the fafts you have dated in your let
ters to me, in proof of the introduftion of
the present fever by the (hip Arethufa, from
Havanna ; by which it will appear, with
what little propriety, or even (hadow of
probability (he has been accused : I (hall
then give a connefted view of the fafts I
have already adduced in my former letters
to capt. Linddrom, to (hew that the disease
proceeded from the ftitnch emitted from the
(now Navigation, from Marfeille^,; and last
ly, suggest fueh rneafures as will be likely to
secure oiir city from a return of that ravag
ing pestilence, or other malignant complaint.
It is agreed that the (hip Arethu'a lod
three persons by disease of some fort, in the
month of June, during her passage from
Jamaica to Havanna. Two of these were
seamen, and died on the 4th of the month,
two days after leaving the fird port. A
negro died on the 16th of June of the Jlux ;
as dated by Stephen Kingdon in his depofi- I
tion taken before the Mayor, on the 14th
â¢ Augud. Though you so confidently refer
to Mr. Kingdon for proof of your assertion,
that all the above persons died of the yellow
fever ; yet you will find, by eonfulting his
deposition, that no mention is made ofthedif
: cafe of the two jirfl who died. It is probable,
ftlat as he was no physician, he did not visit
them while ill s and as he consequently
could not afwrtain their disorder, he did'
not assert when on oath, that they died of
the yellow fever, to please those who said
that was the disease, and raised the outcry
against the (hip. I.have not seen the letter
, of Mr. Fitch to which you also refer for
â¢ proof of the disease having been the yellow
fever ; but from the inaccuracy of your as
' fertion with regard to the deposition of Mr.
Kingston ; I mud beg leave to fee it, before
full credit be given to your ipfe dixit of its
contents. But whatever may have been his
opinion of the nature of the disease of which
the two fifft men died, I may urge the fol
lowing argument againtt the belief of its hav
ing been the yellow fever. This disease we
well know, from the records of 1793, and
1 the experience of the prefent'feafon, spreads
with great malignity and increased virulence,
â  in close hot unventilated plaees ; and where
little attention to cleanlinef6 is observed ;
and we also know all these circumdances
frequently take place on (hip board in the
forecadle where the seamen commonly deep,
f and in the space between decks, when ne
-1 groes are on board, as was the cafe with the
(hip ioquedion ; and yet the disease did not
spread, though there were fifty-fix on board,
t besides the crew eleven in number, and three
f cabin passengers ; which would have increaf
s ed the aftivity of the disease if any had ex-
I ifted. The negro died 011 the i6tb, -but
â¢ he could not have taken the disease from the
' two sailors, because Mr. Kingdon 'fays he
died of the flux ; and Mr. Brien, second
mate of the (hip deposes that he was sick
when taken on board in Jamaica. In the
cafe of the Arethufa, we jind two men die of
a disease supposed to be th e yellow fever ; and
r no one bejlde take it, and under every circvm-
Jlance favorable to its propagation, which I
think a very strong proof that the complaint,
yellow fever or not, was not contagious ; and j a
conTcqnently that the opinion of this "(tiip jes
having imported the disease of (his season, by . fp
communicating inftftion to the fails of the j as
(hip, and cloches of the crew, is unfounded. | tl
From Mr. Brien's deposition, it alio ap- i ?â¢
pears, that the " clothing, bedding and articles I el
belonging to the deceased were thrown over- j tÂ«
board, and their births cleansed so that the 'c<
opinion of the disease having been introduc- ' p
ed in this way, is further disproved. Dur- , w
ing the time the veffellay at Havanna, from ' w
the 2lft of June to the sth July, I am able i 1
to assert, (he was perfectly cleansed ; a mea- | o
sure which every (hip matter would adopt jo
af;er carrying negroes, and after having had a
three deaths on board. All this period, no w
one was (ick, but all remained well the whole c
voyage, until the arrival of the (hip at the J si
fort. The second mate had indeed a lax !tl
wliich came on after they entered the Capes, si
and he went on (hore to the hospital, where (1
he was cured. The (hip had fifteen days t
passage, and came in Jlone ballajl with her t
hatches open, giving thereby a free current u
for the air from ft en to stern, which cer- i
tainly wÂ»uld have dissipated every particle (
of contagion (if any had been on boaid) re- x
maining after the wa(hing and smoking (lie 1 f
had already underwent. The sailors had jâ )
the whole range of the space between decks c
to deep in, but they took no disorder, because r
the feeds of none were there. The pilot hav- t
ing taken ficlc on board the (hip, is thought i
to be a demonstrative proof, that he caught (
the infeftion which had been retained since 1
the 4th June to the 24th July ; but when t
the fails with regard to his illness, and the 1
causes that induced it are considered, I ex- i
pest the idea of infeftion will be laid afkle. <
The pilot has uniformly attributed his indif- '
position to a seVere cold taken by deeping 1
one night, (towards the close of the (hip's
quarantine) in the cabin with the windows
open, when a cold wind blew up, which set
direftly upon him, after a very warm day :
he went to bed well, and awoke with a se
vere hoarseness and pains in his limbsâ
thefe were succeeded by a fever, whieh
at firft you said was " inflammatory,
and succeeded by bilious symptoms, giving us
thereby to underdand, that it was no more
thon a common bilious fever, as we witness
every summer from the fame canfe, as that
' to which the pilot wa< exposed. In his cafe,
' the operation cold, in suddenly check-1
ing perspiration, was probably aided by the
1 noxious effefts of the air blown off to his
vessel from the immense mar(hes opposite to
' whieh the (hips lie at tlie fort: This is uot
' mere hypothefisâlt requires no other
1 knowledge, but that which I have derived
from living in a marshy country, to under
stand, that it is a much more probable way
â¢ of accounting for the pilot's inflammatory
\ bilious fever, than by supposing that the eon*-
tagion, lurking in art empty clean vessel for
upwards of 50 days, was the.cause of it.â
Now let me a(k any man, whether, if any
eontagion had been left by the two sailors
who died on the 4th June ; the reft of the
" crew, and efpeeially the hands (hipped in
their place, who were exposed to it all the
â¢ remaining part of the voyage until her ar-
rival here, would not have been affefted
j thereby ; and yet they all remained well !
'' In your letter of the 24th August, you fay,
" On the 27th July, potwith(\anding the
8 pilot's subsequent recovery, the symptoms
e of the disease unfolded their malignant na
e ture, and coftvmced me his disease was the
yellow fever of Wejt-India origin." Pray
0 what were these " malignant symptoms,"
>" that attended V this inflammatory fever, fuc
" cetded by bilious symptoms" ? Did con-
It fift of the black vomit, of a bleeding at the
e mouth or nose, or a purging of blood, or livid
n spots upon his body, which many of us have
e seen accompany the disease of this season ?
1, I will take upon mÂ« to answer, that none of
thefe symptoms accompanied his cafe, or he
S would not have been well, as you dated, in
i- five days ; and I have no doubt, had you
h not gone too far to retraft, you would ilill
:r allow the mild name firft given to the com
1, plaint to be the proper one. But here I
'â v some to the point. The pilot, you fay,
is took the yellow fever from the (hip. Now
f- granting this, let me a(k, if his disorder was
:, so " malignant" as you (late, why, in the
it name of cause and effeft, did he not give it
y to those who vilited him, or to his friends
d' who condantly nursed and surrounded him,
>f inhaling his " malignant" exhalations for the
d five days he was confined ? If it had been
y the real yellow fever, it certainly could not
;r have failed to affeft all or most of those who
>r were exposed. The disease would confe
w feqnently have gone on to spread among the
f- members of the family ; afterwards to the
r. neighbors, and finally the whole quarter of
re the diftrift of Southwark would have firft
ts fuffered. Shippen-ftreet, and not Pine and
is Penn-dreets,would then have become the fo
h cus, from whence the malady would have
I- spread to the other parts of the city. But
v- did any thing like this take place ? Noâ
re None of his attendants, or friends who vifit
d ed the pilot, took sick. It was not thus
Is with the malignant fever described by Dr.
e, Chifholm of Grenada, which wat imported
re from Boullam ; for it appears from theex
-1 ; trafts you have givenfrom his work, that all
es those who visited the infefted (hip, caught
le the disease, and five sailors, out of the firft
p, fix who went on board, did. The fame ra
e- pidity of propagation is remarked in the
le yellow fever of 1794, at N. Thofe
ot who firft took it. gave it to others, and thus
d, it went en. These fafts fully refute yo<ir
ee opinion. " â  Ignorant of the laws ofconta
if- gion," as I may be, I will refer the cafe to
x- any unprejudiced person (and to a physician
ut in preference) whether under the circum
be (lancet above dated, with regard to the pi
be lot of the Arethufa, favorable to an increased
id aftivity of the contagion, it were even pof
:k fible to escape catching " a malignant yellow
be fever" if pent up with a patient five days and
of nights in his chamber ? And yet we fee an
id ipftance of a fever, formally declared of the
v- above kind, prove as innocent as an inr*rmit-
I tent. What does this prove, the
it, supposed formidably disease wat no more tlian
a common bilious fever from marjby exhalations, '
excited into aftion by a sudden check of per
spiration, from which hundreds are annually
affefted in this city and vicinity, during
the summer and autumn. You date that
!' the crew of the Arethufa, consisting of
eleven hands, left the vessel immediately af
ter her arrival in port, having previously
carried with them their chests, wearing ap
parel and bedding, and that the light fails,
which are often used far bedding by marines,
were deposited in Mr. Bridge's fail-loft.â
These fails (you fay) alone, without any
other infefted article, were fufficient te give
origin to the awful difeafe."-i-Here let me
ask you, how will you prove these fails
were aftually used for'the bedding of the
crew, as you insinuate they often are ; and
suppose they had been used as bedding on
the voyage, how would that make them fuf
ficient to produce the disease when taken on
shore ; what infection was smothered lip in
them ? Did you ever enquire whether the
two men who died forty days before, slept
upon these fails and thus infefted them ?
And how do you know, that these fails
( which you do not fay were adually slept on)
were not frequently and solely used for their
proper purpose during the voyage ? Tho'
j you mud have been conscious of the necessity
of making these enquiries, yet you have
never made them ; and still wiflt to impress
the public with an opinion, that they were
impregnated with the infection which has
spread through the city. But it must be
remembered that not aJingleperfon tookfick in
the fail-loft from handling these fails ; and it
has never been proved, that a single person
in the various lodging houses where the
eleven sailors of the ship difperffi themselves,
was affefted from the supposed infefted bed
ding and chests having been opened among
them. These fafts prove, therefore,' that
these fails were not " fufficient to give rife
to the awful disease and that the supposed
danger of the chests and bedding was a mere
illusion brought forward to give an apparent
authority to your assertion with those who do
not think : for with men who do reflect before
they adopt an opinion of such importance,
your mere assertion, that certain fails from on
: board a vessel, about which you know nothing
i ctrtain, were capable " alone" to produce the
: yellow fever, will have but little weight.
, In your letter of the 24th August, you
â  fay the mate of the brig Iris, the cool, and
: three of the hands, were attacked in fue
> cession. The cock vomited matter as black
> as ink. On the 29th August, you mention
t only one of the above, whose cafe proved
r unequivocally to be the yellow fever, of trs
-1 pical origin. Why this inaccuracy in the
- repetition of fads, if you ar- well allured
f of them ? and if not, how criminal to raise
1 3 noise again ft a ship, to the injury of sci
ence, for the fake of gratifying the preju
r dices of the people, and to obtain a little
- temporary eclat.
f I stated ta the public my opinion, that
s the flench perceived by the neighbours, if
e suing from the snow Navigation, probably
I affefted Mr. Latimer, his man, and the
e people of the brig Iris. You fay, you
- " believe they received the contagion from
i certain articles brought on shore from the
- Arethufa, but Ido not believe it was con
, veyed to them, as yon suppose, by the east
e wind, but by contad." In your next pub
s licabion you fay, " while the brig Iris from
- Oporto was unloading, the crtw of the
e Arethufa had to pass across that vessel to
y get on Ihore with their chests and bedding ;
" and it is natural to suppose, as some bungs
â - flew out of the wine cajls, and the mariners
1- were making merry, that some of the crew of
e the Arethufa also bartook of their cheer with
d them. Mr. Latimer, Mr. Lewis, and others*
e might have received the contagiou from.paffing
? near those people with their infefted mate
>f rials ; those who work in fail lofts from her
e fails qnd those of the Hind, and this I a m
n sure, is one of the ways that the disease
u now continues to be propagated." Hera
II again I will bring you to the touohtftone,
1- by asking upon what grounds your belief
I is founded, that Mr. Latimer, or his man,
r, or Mr. Lewis, came is contaft with the
v supposed infefted articles ? The chests of
is the sailors and their bedding, must have
le pasTed over the deck of the brig Iris, but
it will any one imagine they would have been

d before the ship arrived at the wharf, had
j- any oonneftion with the clothes, &c. of the
re late crew ? or whether they were never
it dried or washed after those deaths ? Befrde,
- will any reasonable man suppose (even
t- granting the Arethufa to have been as in
is fefted as the at Grenada, or a hof
r. pital (hip) that these .sailors by flopping a
d moment on the deck of a Vessel, or by mcrc
ly palling others in the flreet or wharf, could
II infeft them from their clothes, and vet the
it people with whom they lodged, aiid who
â ft were exposed to the contagion of the fame
a- clothes and bedding, in a confined, dirty
ie hcufc (as the rendezvous of sailors cotoimon
fe ly are) would remain free? And yet you
is have never attempted to hy any of these
tir were infefted, though the faft could have
a- been lo easily ascertained, and though it
to was so necessary to trace the progress of the
in disease which you faidwas imported by these
n- clothes. The perfeft freedom from disease
Â»i- whichthefemen enjoyed aftertheir discharge
:d from the Arethufa, as well as those who
f- must have been much more exposed to the
w supposed infeftion of their clothes and bed
id ding in tht,ir lodgings, than the people of
in the Iris from a momentary exposure thereto in
be the open air, njuft prove fully to the fatisfac
t- tion of every unprejudiced mind, " able to
:ie discern the connexion between cause and ef
Â»n feft," (to use your favourite expression) thatt'vcrew of the Iris tnaid nnt have i>een mide
tlls "slÂ«3ged caufc. The fieknefa.
Â», o. these men, may, in my humble opinion,
be rationally and fairly accounted for, by
iefiefling upon their known ai)d acknowled
ged habits of intoxication ; tlieir imprudent
condiiftjn bathing, while under the com
â¢bjned ertedts of liquor and hard work ; and
finally, by fleepiug- upon "the newly washed
deck. These causes not only " might"
but ww.y, have been Sufficient to have pro
duced a malignant fevir in or any o
.ther 1 person ; if the Arethufa had never been
â  Within a hundred miles of them ; and the
of that {hip to the Iris it an ac
â¢eidental circumstance no friorc conne&ed
â¢with the sickness of the latter's crew, than
with the reign of any particular planet
What fort of proof is your afTertion, that
Mr. Latimer, and Mr. Lewis, might have
( received the contagion from pafiing near the
sailors ! Beside I C3n prove that Mr. Lewis
was out of town when the crew were dis
charged ; and all the supposed infe&ed ma
terials were removed ; he returned on the
30th July (6 days after the Arethufa ar
rived) and on the firft of August, the
day of his attach, he complained much of the
flench from the snow Navigation, and ask
ed with some anxiety, how long file had
been at the wharf. Three, men who were
about the fame time difeharging flour from
a fliallop, ar.d two men unloading weod
nigh the fnnw, and who took the disease
from the flench, were all out of town at the
time the crew of the Are;hufa were dischar
ged. 1 have before Hated these objeftions,
but you have never noticed them. You as
sert that Mr. Latimer's man was sick at the
the snow began to unload, which was :
on the 27th of July, and infinnated that he '
could not have taken the disease from her ; 1
but I am able to prove that he was on the 1
wharf on the 29th, at the very time the 1
ftencb from the snow was strongest ; and i
here 1 may observe. that if it b> supposed <
only one person inffty, who passed the snow, \
while her cargo was difeharging, was high- v
ly disposed to take the disease, it would ac- .1
count for its appearance soon after, in feve- t
ral parts of the city, and even at South wark <i
and Kensington. However, medical men d
will be better able to determine this point, b
As to the fails of the Arethufa deposited f
' in Mr. Bridge' 3 Loft, I have already dated r
that no one took sick from handling them, ti
And tho' you fay, " they were alone fuffi- n
cient to give rife to the awful disease yet
very little weightwill be connedted with that tl
mere afTertion, when opposed by such plain lc
well attested faÂ£h; Suppose the physicians ir
of Philadelphia, half a century hence, or t<
those of Europe at thi present time, would cl
wish to investigate the origin of the disease g
of this year, does any person Â«f reflection ft:
believe, they would be fatisfied as to the
certainty of its having been imported by tl
these clothes and fails, because a physician e:
said he believed the disease "was propagated e<
in this way ; nay, that he was "sure" of w
it : and that people many miles off might T
have reeeived the contagion from paffifig v<
near them ? Would such reasoning pass > hi
Weuld not the fads be demanded ? Certain- al;
ly they would ; and these fafts oppose eve- cr
ry thing you have said as to the importation to
of the disease by the Arethufa. nc
The crew of the Iris, that lay at Mr. fa
RufTel's wharf, as did the Arethufa did not an
take sick from the infS'ion blown off from ra
the bedding, or out of the key holes of the ot
ehefts of the latters crew, as they passed o- m:
â¼er the decks ; but either from the flench A
or sou} air emittedfr*m the snow, and blown th
by the N. E. winds ; or from their frequent "vie
intoxication with Port wine, with which er<
the brig was loaded ; and from their bathing
in the river while under its effefb, and thi
while warm from work. It was obfervt dby an
several who are now alive, and will prove W3
what I fav, that the sailors were frequently an<
seen drinking wine, and after coming out ret
of the river, they would wash the deck, and ha'
then sleep oif them without any covering, we
exposed to the damp from the deck, and the ma
heavy dews that fall - at that season. I sub- rcti
mit it to any unprejudiced physician, or to fell
any other, praflicallyacquailited with bilious bu:
fevers, whether this conduit was not more the
likely to produce a malignant bilious fever, fa
than the cause you mention. You acknow- rig
ledge to have pueforibed for two of the crew doi
in a Jlate of infen/ili/ity from drink, but you Aar
fay they were well the next day ; now may I
not this very debauch have lain the founda hav
tjon for their subsequent attack of the fe- of
ver they fuffered ; for perhaps you will find, hoj
upon inquiry that these very men were the anj
persons whom you fay, firft took the fever ar;
from the Crew of the Arethufa palling them.
And here I mull remark, that you ought to w h.
* have ascertained this fa6t, while tracing the ra t<
origin of the disease, as it is necefTary to
establish your opinion. It is indeed aftonifti- evei
ing, that, with these fa&s before you, (for pof
you could not have been ignorant of them, ov e
had you made the proper inquiries before so boa
confidently aflerting your opinion,) you t
should suppose the mÂ«n were infe&ed by the ' wa
Arethufa's crew, and knowing, as every hie
oine knows, that intoxication and subsequent and
exposure to cold and damps, are the mod ed 1
potent causes of autumnal diseases; but leav
granting that these people really had the judi
yellow fever, they must have taken it from as 1
the snow Navigation, as the stench from her and
was then, perceived at the wharf where she w *r
lay, which was about 20 yards to the south- the
ward of the ffct, where two men lock the f'' or
disorder from the fame cause as mentioned fÂ° r
above. B. WYNKOOP. h*e:

>ro- 0n Saturday last, a very handsome ship
'o- 800 tons burthen, named the India, w
sen launched from the yard of MelTrs. Ed wait
the Gillett, and Larkins.
Ac- It is with much concern we relate t :
ted loss of hon. company's armed fehooner tl
lan Ganges, commanded by Mr. Wade, a brant
â¢ Pilot on this establishment. The partic
hat lars of this event are as follow :
ive The Ganges came to an anchor on tl
the evening of the nth curt, in about fix fatho,
wis water, to the eastward of Lacaip's channel
lit- Ihe Laurel was then about foijr leagues di
na- tant further in the offing, in a fouth-eaflerl
direaron. About 8 o'clock at night, whi]
ar- Mr. Wade and his officers were on deck,
the servant gave notice than a diftgreeabfe fme
he of burning oil and smoke was perceptible i
k- the cabin. On going below" the smoke ap
ad peared to be coming from aft. The gun
:re room was immediately cleared, and on open
>m ing the scuttle of the after gun-room, th
Â° r e rufiled out with great violence, an<
ife plainly indicated that to be the quarte
he where the mifchief lay.
ir- Mr. Wade prudently direfted all the car
is, tricge powdefthat was in'thc gun-room anc
if- cabin to be quickly removed and csrrried for
he ward, while himfelf, his officers, and the mod
as aftive of his people were employed iu throw
he ing byckets 0 f water into the after gun
â¢; room. Their efforts were greatly impeded
le by the Suffocating vapour that affaijed them,
le which increased so much as soon to render
id it wholly impossible to continue below, and
â d compelled Mr. Wade and those who were
v, with him in the gun-room to make' their
1- way upon deck. The fire had now kind
:- led into flame, and was burfling forth from
;- the cabin windows : but Mr. Wade still in
k bulged the hope of being able to get it un
n der ; and continued to employ every pofli
:. ble exertion for that purpose ; but at the
d fame time, as a mcafure of prudence, he di
d rested his officers to get the boat out, and
. to keep her clear a little a-head of the schoo
ner.
t The boat was no got over the fide,
t than thirty or forty pfople impetuously
1 leaped on board ; and the officers found it
s. indispensably necessary to put off, in order
r to prevent the boat from being further fur
-1 charged, for it was not without great dan
: ger that (he earried the number by which
1 she was already crowded.
: Mr. Wade, and those who remained with
' the fehooner, persevered in the mod spirited
\ exertions to extinguish the fire ; but it gain-
I ed ground in spite of all their efforts, and
F waÂ» rapidly extending from aft forward.
The people, every moment in dread of the
vessel blowing up, crowded forward upon
1 her bows, bowsprit, jib-boom, &c. In this
alarming situation Mi*. Wade with great
composure and presence of mind, proceeded
to prepare rafts. He exhorted the people
not to despair, reminding them that their
fafety depended on their own exertions,
and encouraging them to assist in making
rafts. He, his two boatswains, and some
others were stepping aft to cut away the
main-mafl that it might serve as a last spar.
At this inflant, the fire communicated to
the magazine, which exploded with great
violence, tearing up the deck from the taff
erel to several feet before the main-mafl.
By this accident four men were killed,
the second boatswain f?hd his leg brokenj
and Mr. \yade was thrown several feet for
ward upon deck ; he was severely bruised,
and lay for some time insensible. At length
recovering himfelf, he found that the flames
had nearly ceased, mod of the parts that
were on fire having been blown up with the
magazine ; he was encouraged therefore to
renew his efforts to save the remains of the
fehooner ; but unfortunately a part of the
burning materials had been carried up, by
the explosion of the magazine, into the'
main-top, and this communicating to the
ringing, set the whole on fire, which falling
down from time to time, re-kindled the
flame in various parts of the hull; and most
of the water buckets and other implements 1
having be?n blown overboard, the exertions I
of the people became less effeilual, and no 1
hope now remained of being able' to save
any part of the wreck, that might serve as
a raft for those who remained.
The flames extending over nearly the
whole of the wreck, left no time to delihe- t
rate, and but little for a lad-exertion. A *
fheep-peu, pieces of plank, spars, or what- c
ever cou.d be met with to answer the pur- r
pose, were hastily lashed together, and put '
overboard as a raft, to which all the nfen on c
board, amounting to forty-nine, were oblig- c
cd to commit their fafety. The pooi* boat- t
twain who, from his broken leg, was una- I
ble almost to move, was assisted to the raft; 0
and all hands having got hold, it was push- c
ed from along fide : but immediately before 0
leaving the fehooner, Mr. Wade had very c
judiciously ordered the cable to be cut, that n
as it was ebb tide the wreck of the fehooner d
and the raft might drift out together to
wards the Laurel, and that the light from
the burning wreck might guide the boats
from that ship in the track to find them ; 1
for as thtry had fired guns of distress on the
breaking out of the fire, and as they knew
the light must be seen from the Laurel,
they confided in her coming to their assist- b
ance. p
The raft and the wreck continued drift- f:
ing with the ebb tide, within pistol-shot of a
each other, for about two hours, when the ! tl
wreck suddenly went down : a circumstance ' I
that rendered their situation more dismal, ' a
as the disappearance of the light lessened ; It
the chance of the expected boats falling in h
with them. Mr. Wade proposed that tl;*y â¢ Q
should now and then raise a general fliout, y
as the boats might perhaps be within hear- tl
