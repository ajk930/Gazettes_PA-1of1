[CON TIN U.E D.J
Vie fee then, that in forming cojine&ions with us in
i-; 8, the Court of France, the a<9ual organ of the
lotion, liad 110 regard to the interest of the United
Spates.: but that their objeA was, by feiiting the
f:on of dismembering the British empire, to diminish
the power of a formidable rival : anithat when, after
we had carried on a d ift re fling war for seven years, the
great objeA for which we had contended, Independ
ence, was within our rearfi, that Court endeavored to
postpone the acknowledgement of it by GreSt Britain,
irnl eventually to deprive us of its faireft fruitsâa just
extent of territoryâthe navigation of the Miffifippiâ
Tiind the Fishery.
Snch'being the motives arid condu<S of France, what
ir.fpired our truly gratefal fentiraents towards that na
-tion ? The ardent afl'edlion, the fincerr friendftiip of A
>.iericans to Frenchmen ? We were engaged in a com
mon caofrajiirtft Groat' Britainâ received loans of
lnonry.âwe were aided by troops aad Aips in attack
ing and conquering tke common enemy in the t.ofom
o. our country ; and this afiociation in war produced
-acquaintances and perfooal friendships : and experienr
ingthefe benefits, we gave way to our feelings, with
out inquiring into themotives from which they were
rendered.
But why are we so often reminded of the debt of
-gratitude? Is it really more than gratitudeâbecause
compensation is txpefled, to cancel it ? If compensati
on is the objeiS, tire treaty of alliance has absolved the
claimâ" The_contraaing parties declare, that being
u resolved to fulfil, each on its own part, the clauses
â¢' and conditions of the present treaty of alliance, ac
' lts own power and circumstances, there
' Jball.be no after claim ef compensation, rm one fide or
' tneither, whatever may bethe event of the war."
â  lam here naturally led to notice Mr. Adet's charge,
already mentioned, âThat iue have not offered to
France the fuse ours which friend/hip might have given
â¢without comprmiit'mg the government.
If Mr Adet had fpecified the kind of succours which
might thus have been offered, we could better iudjre of
the correflnefs of his assertion.
But is it true that we have rendered no succours so
t ' le following paflages in the Secretary
of State s letter of the i&th of August, 1703, to Mr.
Morris. â Â« \\ e recoiled* with fatisfatfion, that in the
Â« eourfeof two years, by unceasing exertions, we paid
up seven years arrearages and instalments of our debt
to France, which the irtefficac-y of our firft form of
government had fufiered to be accumulating; that
" pressing on still to the entire fulfilment of our en
gagements, we have facilitated to Mr. Genet the ef
" fe<3 of the inftalmentsof the present year, to enable
him to fend relief to his fellow-citizens in France,
threatened with famine ; that in the firft moment of
, U? e "^ which threatened the colony of St.
â¢' Domingo, we stepped forward (so their relief with
arms and money, taking freely on ourselves the rife
"Of an unauthorized aid, when delay would have
been denial'' âthat we have given the exclusive ad
mission to fell here the prizes made by France on her
enemies in the present war, though unftipnlated in
our treaties, and unfounded in her own pradlice or
â¦' in that of other rations, as we believe.''
To this detail I hjve to add, That, of all the Loans
and luppl.;, received from France in the .Vtnericau
War, amounting nearly to fifty-three millions of livres,
the United States u:i<W their late GÂ»vÂ«rnment had
been enabled to pay not two millions and a half of liv
ics ; that the present government after paying tip the
arrearages and instalments mentioned by Mr. Jefferfon,
has been continually anticipating the fubftquent inftal
menti, untii in the year 1795 the whole of our debt to
france was discharged, by anticipating the payment of
eleven millions and a half of livres ;.no part of which
â would have becomc due until the second s>f September,
1796, and then only one million and a half 1 the resi
due at subsequent periods ; the last not until the year
lies. '
1 There remain yet various passages in Mr. Adet's
Notes on which some observations are to be made
In my lettrr of the firft of November last, in an
swer to Mr. Adet's note of Oflober 47, in which he
communicated the Decree of the Executive Directory
of the 2d of July last, declaring that the flag of the
republic of France ihould treat the flag of neutrals in
the fame manner as these {hall fuffer it to be treated by
the English, I afeed an explanation of the decree ; men
tioning the circumstances which excited doubts. There
feeraed to be lufficient cause for enquiry. Had the
Decree referred to the paji captures by the i nglilh,
our knowledge of them would have been some guide in
forming our epinion of tne threatened captures by tl*
French : but the operation of the decree was to depend
on the future condutf of the English ; the French
were to treat the flag of neutrals as these [/hallfuffer it
tÂ» be* treated by the Englift. As this could not be as
certained beforehand, we wiftied to know whether the
restraints then exercised by the British Government
were com'idsred as of a nature t* juftify a denial of
those rights which were pledged to us by our treaty
â¢with Fiance ? Whether the orders had aSually been
given to eapture the veflels ef the United States ? And
â if given, what were the precise terms of those orders ?
Mr. Adet in his reply fays that I appear not to have
linderftood either the Decree of the Direflory or his
Note which accompanied it. The meaning of the
Decree is certainly not very obvious. The manner of
executing it, was declared to depend on a contingency
âthe future condncft of the Englift. How were the
French cruifcrs in the four quarters of the World, to
determine v>hat was the condufl of the Englift at any
given time ? If he could have furnifted a copy of the
orders afloally given to French armed vefTels, under the
decree, we might have seen clearly what were the in
tentions of the Directory. If we are to take the prac
tice of the French armed veflels and of some of the
)'reach tribunals as the true illustration of the decree,
Mr. Adet's own explanation will be very defedlive. Ho
has fpecified only two cases, the taking at Englift (or
other enemy's) property on board American vessels and
the seizure of all the goods classed ,1 contraband in our
treaty with; Great Britain. In the cafe of contraband
the seizure of them is lawful only when they are
deÃjned to the.ports of enemies; and 'the contraband
goods only are liable to confifration. But the fperial a
gents of the Directory in the Weft-Indies order the
leizure of all vefTels-haying on board contraband goods,
r,o matter whether destined to an enemy's, or to a neu- 1
tral, or even tea French port j and when seized, they <
Â«onmcate not merely the contraband articles, but all ,
other goods, and the vessel hcrfelf in which they are
laden. They also afiigt, in their decrees of confifcation
another came of capture and condemnationâ that the
American vessel has failed to or from a port in pufiTeffi- I
on of the Englift. We art not informed that the En- 1
gblh take any neutral vessels for this cause. We have
heard of Tevcral American vessels being captured and
' onfifcated by the French merely because they had not 1
a fc-a-letter, when no doubt could have been entertain
r'l "[ the property being American. Yet it is concciv- 1
rd that the- want of a fÂ«a letter was never intended to (
.rachitic other proof* of'property..
Further, ought we to have imagined that the
I ecutive J)ireÂ£tory intended to leave it to the
rfiT'.wtioc of every privateer, and of every inferior
tribunal to judge what at any time fulfequtnt to
. I heir decree was the eflua'l treatment received by
f American vessels from "the Britift > Ought we tÂ°
have imagined that the decree was formed in such
indefinite terms on purpdfe to give scope for arbi
trary conftru&ion, and consequently for Unlimited
e . oppreflion ? Ought we to haÂ»e imagined what Mr/
d' Adet has himfelf declared to fee the meaning of the
. decree, that the French armed vcfTcls were not to
content themfelvcs wuh capturing American vef-
T having English property or contraband .goods
e on board, and getting such property and goods
J condemned by their tribunals ; but if any English
commanders were to praaife Â«< vexations" towards
ft Americans, that Frenchmen were to do the fame ?
- Ought we to have imagined that the Diicftory in
tended the citizens of France rtiould be encouraged
t to take revenge on their frieÂ»(Js for the outrages of
" their enemies ? And wliat is to limit fhefe vexati
. on Â« â  If one Englift commander in a hundred per
f. verfely and wanteul) abuses his power, is every
French officer to become his rival in dishonor ? Or
1 we are to fuffet only meafuFe far measure (and
i surely the decree goes not beyond this) who is to
designate the every hundredth French officer who
' is to be the instrument of similar oppression ?
But French armed vessels are to wake all these
f "P tare ' ln of the treaty, and we arc to
e fuffer all these vexations in violation of reafan and
- humanity, while we endure them from the Englift
f " without an efficacious opposition !'' And what

t Instead of further comment* on this -fubjedt, let
f mc present to yon some passage* in Mr. Adet's let
ter of the 14th of July 1795.* In this letter he
, communicated to the secretary of state the decree
' Â°f 'he committee of public fafety of the 3d of Ta.
â¢ nuary repealing the sth article 01" the de
j crce of the 1 yth of November 1794.! The lat

t iels to capture, and by adding to the lift of ,rti
. cles contraband : It was therefore repealed by the
â  Mr. Adet feired this occasion to make
â  the following declaration. Â«Â« Yrvu will fee, fir,
f â ,n b , otl Â» C th e decrees] the undisguised
difpafitton and fmcere desire of the French go
-1 " y e ["ment religiously to obfeive the engagements '
: it has contrasted with it. allies, and its readiness
; to redrrls inflations which have never taken
â¢ " place but from the impulse of circumstances."
It is arm id ft her triumphs that the republic loves '
. " to give this striking mark of, its fidelity. Vic- 1
" torious France knows no otherconcern than that '
of justiceâno other diplomatic language than
truth, to this justice,
to this fidelity, we now make our appeal : <
From the ftil< of Mr. Adet's complaint of the 1
British Iwgfufered to arm in our ports, it might 1
be imagined the instance* were numerous. None 1
were permitted ; the aHual armaments were few : 1
and are as old as the year 1793, and were repre 1
fented by Mr. Genet to the secretary of state. 1
What answer (aflc. Mr. Adet) did the govern- 1
ment give to the representations of the minister 1
ot the French republic in this refpc& ? It said 1
that these vefTels failed too Suddenly ; that it \yas '
" not able to cause them tÂ»be stopped." The an- 1
fwer was given by the secretary of state in different '
words.J " Those from Charleston and Philadelphia 1
have gone off before it ivat known to the govern
" ment, and the former indeed in the firft moments !
" of the war, and before preventive measures could
be taken iÂ« so diflant a port." In the cafe of 1
the Trusty Captain Hale, at Baltimore, the Go- 1
vernor of Maryland having been informed that she 1
had been buying gun, had given orders to examine Â«
the fatt â¢Â« but /he got off before the officer could '
get on board, having cleared ftit three or four
' da y s before." I have not ebferved that Mr. '
Genet ever renewed his complaint with regard to {
any of these vessels, Whence f suppose he was fa- 1
, tished with the answer : as indeed l.e ought to J
f"' of-,"', ,T tc two En Â« li ' b "ffels that failed I
from - tiiladelphia escaped even the vigilance ef the k
French ConfulJ âboth had departed many days be- "
fere he had been informed of them. Thisisftated 8
by the Consul himfelf in his report of the 21ft of
June 1793, to Mr. Genet. And yet the govern
ment is now charged by Mr. Adet with violating
the treaty because it did not stop them !âAltho'
the officers of the United States had been requi-ed
to be watchful, and to report all illegal armaments
in our ports, yet it was Natural for the government
to cxpeft to derive information from the French
Consuls, who doubtless were charged by their own
government labe particularly vigilant in regard to
all attempts at such armaments by the Â«nemies of
the republic. Mr. Adet remat ks that " some inba
" ,aa, I Bef the Um'ed States had aided in these
" illegal armaments of the enemies of France
and aftcs, Â«Â« what measures were taken agaiuft them ?
Wat any fearcli made todifcover themâto pro
" fccutethem ? Nevc,"_Y, t the veiy letter from
Mr. Genet to the secretary of state, in which and
its inclofures Mr. Adet has found this fubjeft of
complaint, fuggafts a different conclusion. "IS
" learn with pleasure (fays Mr. Genet) by your b
" letter of the 23d of this month [June 1793] '
that the government of Georgia have caused to a
be flopped a vefTel armed in that state, for the K

roe of Ihe 12th of September 1 1795, the fenti
i, menu and reasonings of the government oÂ» that
. and other fubje&s relating '.Â«> France had been fully
t cxprefied, to enable him to make immediate com
-1 munications to the French government itfelf *; and
it was hoped That the information given in that let
s tec, and in otheis written to him the preceding
s finamer, would have furnifhed materials (and that
1 these materials would have been timely used) foi
s such representations as would have fatisfied the
? French government, that the United States, in
. forming the treaty with Great-Britain, had only
J exercised an indifputablc right : and neither by
f that treaty nor any other aft had infringed a fin
. gle article of our treaties with France.
On the fubjeft of the imprefles of our seamen,
f mentioned in Mr. Adet* s letters ef March and A
r pril 1796, I (hall only add, that nothing was more
J notorious than that those imprefles had excited uni
> rerfal refentw.ent in the United States, and been
j the fubjeft of repeated remonstrance from our go
vernment to the British court. Thus in Mr. Pinck
c ney's note to .Lord Grenville in Aug. 1793, which
> was published here that year, in the fame colle&ian
1 of State paper* with Mr. Jefferfon's letter of Sep
! tember 7th* which Mr. Adet has quoted, and on
I the sth page next succeeding it, we find the so!
lowing : " Under this head, it may be observed,
. " that for want of arrangements being made for
. " the feenrity of American seamen in the portsÂ«f
I " this country (England) they are fubjeft to the
, " various hardships Mr Pinckney'has so frequently
| " detailed to Lord Grenville." And in the next
â  P a i? e i ' n his letter to Mr. Jefferfon, Mr. Pinckney
faysâ" The protection afforded our seamen re
" mains also on the fame footing ; they (the Bri
" tifti government) protrfs a wiUingnefs to secure
, 1t to us all real American seamen, when proved to
" be such ; but the proof they will not dispense
" with." To remove as far as poflible the embar
rassments irifing ftom this cause, and more efieftii
ally to protest our seamen, was the ohjeft of a bill
pending in congress, and the fubjeft of public dc
bate, at the time I received Mr. Adet'i letters.
This bill was paflsd into a law.
All these acts demonstrated that the government
did not aflent, but on the contrary that they refif
tcd the impressment of American seamen ; and
this refinance has been continued confeqtiently
we cannot be charged on this ground with a violati
on of our neutrality.
Among the former fubjefts of complaint not
now renewed by Mr. Adet, is that against the go
vernment for permitting the purchase and exporta
tion of horses, by British agents, in the course of
the lift winter and spring. The correspondence on
this fubjeft is lengthy ; and yet the question lies
within a very narrow compass.
Perhaps no rule is now better established, than
that neutral nations have a right to trade freely with
nations at war ; either by carrying and felling to
them all kinds of merchandise, or permitting them
to come and purchase the fame commodities in
neutral territory ; in the latter cafe, not refufing
to one power at war what it permits another to
purchase ; with this exception in refpeft to articles
contraband, that if the cruisers of one of the bel
ligerent powers meet at sea with neutral veflels la
den with such articles destined to the potts of their
enemies, the neutral veflels may be captured, and
the contraband goods will be lawful prize to the
captors : but the refidne of their cargo and the
veflels themselves ire to be discharged.
But if there were aÂ»-y doubt on this paint under
the law of nations, there can be none in relation to
France and the United States ; because this mat
ter is specially regulated by their treaty of com
inercc. 1 his treaty, so far from retraining the
trade of either party remaining neutral, while the
other is engaged in war, provides regulations agree
ably to which it Jhould be couduSed.
The 12th and 13th articles authorize either par.
ty that is at war, to flop the neutral merchant ve(-
fels of the other destined to the ports of an enemy,
upon just grounds of suspicion, concerning the voy
age or the lading. If on examining the (hip's pa
pers it appears there are any contraband goods on
board " consigned for a port under the obedience
" of his enemies" (he may be earned into port,
and the contraband articles may, by regular pro
ceedings in the admiralty, be conhfcated : " saving
" always as well the fliip itfelf as any other goods ,
" found therein, whieh by this treaty are to be ef
" teemed free : neither may they be detained on
" pretence ot their being as it were infected by !
" the prohibited goods, much less (hall they be
" confifcated as lawful prize."âlt further pro- !
vides, that if the matter ef the neutral (hip (hall be
willing ta deliver the contraband goods to the cap.
tor, and the latter receives them, then is the neu i
tral (hip to be forthwith discharged and allowed
freely to profeiute her voyage. The 23d article '
goes furtherâif the neutral (hip (hill have on board
the inemiet of the other " they are not to be taken
" ont unless they aieftidier; in allualfervice."
These articles are so explicit, it may seem strange
that a donbt (hould arise concerning them ; I pre
sume no doubt did arise j for Mr. Adet, overlooking
these provisions of the treaty, demanded that the
government (hould flop the exportation of horses,
by the British, upon the principle that it was a neu
tral duty required by the law of nations. An 1
answer was given to his demands* in which the re- 1
gulations of our treaty with France were particu- 1
larly brought into view, as well as the rules of the
law of nations. Mr. Adet, however, after some '
time renewed his claims; but again kept the treaty Â«
out ef fight. An answer was given to these re- >
newed claims ; and we heard no more of the fubjeft <
until the French privateers in the Wcit-Indies began 1
to capture American veflels which had horfet on 1 '
board. You will find amoog the documents on c
this fubjeft, the copy of a decree of the citizens '
Victor Hugues and Lebas, the special agents of' 1
the Executive Dircftory in the windward islands,
condemning an American vejjel and her entire cargo, r
for having a small number ef horfet on board not '
hound to their enemy't but to a neutral port. And
the special agents ground their decree on the advice r
* Mr. AdÂ«t by mistake dates it September I,3th,
s they rtce'vud from Mr. Adet, under the date of the
c 14th Mcfridar, beingjuly 2d, 1796. This veflel
- and cargo were tlrus condemned without the fight
. of a Angle paper belonging tcÂ» Her : the maftjr had
t them in his pocket, and would have brought them
f home, but for the recollection of the interpreter,
â¢ some hours after the sentence of condemnation had
i been puffed. These citizens exercise indeed a very
- brief authority. The process in the cafe of a second
j; American vet Tel, which to complete her lading had
t taken on board nineteen horfts, but which was alio
t bound to a neutral port, was in this form. The
s captain having come before one of the agents, he,
1 without any previous examination or hearing, id
)' dressing himfelf to the captain, pronounced len
s tence in these wordsâ" 1 have your
. vessel and cargo"âclosing the sentence with op
ptobious language.
, Mr. Adet, on the 18th of May'laft, revived his
. predeceflor's claim of right by treaty to fell their
t prizes in our ports. This occafioncd the corref
. pondeuce on this fubjedt, which you will
1 among the documents collected on this occaiion.
. He contents himfelf, however, with considering it
. as a right granted not positively, but by imp/ieation.
, That is, because the treaty forbids the enemies of
1 France to fell their prizes in our ports âtherefore it
. grants to her a right of felling her prizes. As if my
j friend's denial of a favor to my enemy, was in fact
a grant of the fame favor to me. Tne limple
, llatemeut of the ground of the claim would seem
fnfficient to fhev that the treaty will Â»ot support
f it. That tales of French prizes have been at all
permitted, has been owing to the indulgence of the
1 government. This indulgence was cwntiuued until
it interfered with a new positive obligation : an
â¢ obligation precisely the fame that France herfelf
contested eight yearsfuhfequent to her treatv with
us, and with the fame power. This obligation is
found in the 24111 article of our treaty," and the
, ifcth of the French treaty, with Great Britain.
Thus France and the United States alike engaged
to permit no enemy of Great Britain to arm priva
teers in their ports, Â»r te fell their prices there, or in
any maniier to exchange them. Consequently had
I' ranee remained at peace, and we engaged ir. a
war with Great Britain, our privateers wuuld not
be permitted to fell theit prizes in French potts.
And by the maritime law of France*, prize*, ex
cept they are taken from her enemies, can stay in
her ports bo more than 24 hours, unless compelled
by temped to remain longer; and the sales of fych,
prizes are forbidden under severe penalties. But
notwithstanding the certainty of our rigi t to tar
bid the fa/es of prizes in our ports, and notwitb.
(landing the express legal command of the Chief
Justice of The United States holding a circuit court
m South-Carolina in May last prohibiting the falc
of a particular prize (the Britirti ship Amity) at
Charlestonâthe French agents fold the p.iz eve/Tel
and the sale received the formal fanaion of the
French consul. Yet even this affair has been made
a fubjed of complaint by Mr. Adet, because the
collefitor of that port rcfufed a clearance to the prize
veflel thus fold in defiance of the authoirty of the
United States ; and because he also delayed until,
in a new cafe, he (hould get advice, to peimit the
exportaticn of the cargo of the prize ship, which
on a survey had been reported to be irreparable.
indeed the French minister has difcorered an
aptitude to complain. I may cite, as inftancei,
his letters of the 9 th of January and 3 d'of March
I7SKJ : the former, because the colours of France,
which he had prcfented to the United States, were
not permanently fixed and displayed before Con
grtis : the latter, because some printers of Alma-
Hacks, or other periodical publications it) the
United States, in arranging the names of the foreign
miniftere and agent, residing amongff us, had pla ed
those of Great Britain before those of France and

Excepting the fecoad complaint, relative to the
attempt of the Eng!i(h (hip Africa to seize Mr.
Fauchet an his papersâand the 3d article under
the firft complaint relative to the Crinfular conven.
tiott, all the charges iâ this summary have been al
ready examined, and we think proved to be un
founded.
As to the Consular Convention, many inconven
iences would attend the giving of the Consuls aju
rifuiftion to the extent contended for on the part of
the French Republic, to be exercised by French
Consuls in the United States, and confeqtirnlly by
American Consuls in France. The inconveniences
arc mnaSfeftly/o great as to require very explicit
language in the Convention of the two Nations
on this jubjeft, to authorize the conclusion that
such an enlarged jurifdiftion was intended. It
would beto erect in foreign iountries complete courts
of J'jftice, with effe&ual process to compel the ap
pearance of parties and witnefles, and to execute
their decisions. And a* the tranfaftions ef com
merce and navigation could not in the nature of
things be confined to the foreigners alone,| the Citi
zens of the Country mult often be necessary witnef
les to these tranfaftions, and of course rendered a
menable tp this foreign jurifliftion in their own
cou try : whereat the juridiction demanded is only
of French Consuls over French citizens in the Uni
ted States ; and reciprocally of American Conluls
over the citizc sos the United States in France.
From these roi fiderations a p'efumption would a
rise, that the ju> ifÂ«tifti<in contemplated in the Con
sular Convention was to be merely voluntary, but
at the fame time txclujive of the Courts of tht Coun
try. An examination of the convention we believe
will support thia and no other conftrudion. The
12th Article provides that all differences and suits
between Frenchmen in the United States, and be
tween Citizens of the United States in France, and
particularly all disputes between seamen and their
Captains, and between Captains of different veffcls
â¢f their nation (hall be determined by the refpeftive
Consuls, either by reference to arbitrators, or by a
summary judgment an d without co/!s "No officer
â¢' of the Country, Civil or Military ; (hall inter
" fere therein, or take any part whatever in the
matter."âThis last elaufe alone would seem fnffi
cient to repel the claim we are considering. Sher
iffs, Marshals, and tiieir Deputies tannot aid in
the execution of Consular desifions, because they
are " Officers of the Country'' expressly forbidden
to " take any part in the matter." But was it
meant that the laws (hould give Consuls the power
to appoint fseh executive officers of their own na
tion ? We find no such thing in the Convention
On the contrary in the cafe of deserters from vef
fcls mentioned in the 9th article, whom the Consuls
are authorised to cause to be arrclled, they are ex
pressly diretted to apply in writing to the " courts,
" Judges and Officers competent" to make the
arrells ; meaning the Courts, Judges and Officers
of the Country where the Conluls reside. Betides,
tf power could be given to Consuls to appoint offi
cers to execute their decisions, these officers most
of course have their (ees of compensation to be paid
by one or ether of the parties : but the 12th Ar
tide declares that the Consular judgment (hall be
41 without cotts."âTo these observations I sub
join the deliberate opinions of two refpeftable law
yers, Mr. Harrifon of New-York, and Mr. Brad
ford, the late Attorney General of the United
States. "'1 have considered the tjth Article of
" the Convention between his late most Christian
" Majctty and the United States of America, and
" also the ait ef Congrcfs conccrm'ng Conluls and
" Vise Consuls, so far as it prcfcribes the duty of
" Marshals of the United States, and it is my opin
" ion that the Marshals are not bound by law to
execute any sentence ef a French Confu!, arif

" Philadelphia, 14th March 1794."
The other complaint under this oead is, that ]
the Judges who are charged (by aft ofCongrefs) !
to ifftie warrants of arrest against deserters from
French veffcls have require.! the original ship's roll 1
to prove that the men alleged to have deserted were
a part of the Crew ; in contempt of the ytli Arti
cle which admits in the tribunals of both Countries
copies certified by the Consul.
if we look at the gth article of the Consular trea
ty we (hall fee that the Cohfuls who demand the
Errefts of <lefetters' from veflels of their nation, must
prove " by an exhibition of thetegiftcrs of the vef
" fcls or ships roll, that those men were" part of
" the Crew." It isapparent that the original roll,
sind not a copy is here referred to ; nor indeed is the
contrary pretended ; but it isfaicTthat the jtfc Ar- !
ticle admits certified Consular copies as evidence in
the Courts of both nations. But the sth article
appears to have no relation to the fubjeft of the 9th.
It ftipufctes that " the Consuls refpeftively shall
" have the exclusive right of receiving in their
" chancery, er on board of veflels, the declarations
41 and all othet acts which the Captains, Masters,
44 CrewSj Passengers and Merchants of their nation

44 receive faith in law, equally as their originals
4! would." The (hip's roll (or (hipping paper)
of a veflels ctew is not an aft to be done, before the
Consul, but evidence of a private agreement be
tween the Captain of a veflfel and his crew; and
vhen he alleges that any of them, have deserted,
the 9th article requires this original evidence ef the
fact to be produced to the Judge as the ground on
which he shall issue hie warrant to arrest them.
And this is the conftruftion put on this article by
the J udgeg; and for ought 1 know, without any
diversity of opinion. The difference alleged hy
Mr. Fauchet in one of his L-trers to the Secretary
of State I have inquired into ; and find he wai
under a mistake. Amd the mistake srsfe probably
from this circumstance, that whsn from the infor
mation of the Confu! there was danger that the
deserter would wholly escape unless instantly ap
prehended. the Judge hag ifiued his warrant to ar
rest and bring before him the alleged deserter ; but
wheÂ« brought, that Judge has not committed the
Man, or delivered him to the Consul, unless the
original toll was produced tp prove him one of the
(hip's crew.
As to the outrage agaioft Mr. Fauchet by the
Africa Man of War, in attempting to fciee him
and his papers within the jurifdiftirm of the United
States, and Captain Home's insult on their au
thority, I do not knew what measures more effica
lious could have been taken by the Executive than
these which were adopted to obtain fatisfaftion.
After waiting a reasonable time for explanations)!)
the part of Gapt- Home, and of Mr Moore the
Engliih Vice-Consul, and receiving none, the
President revoked the Exequatur of the Vice-Con
sul, and desired the Governor of Rhode 1(1 nd,
where the Africa had been lying to communicate
to Captain Home the demand of the President -,
That he (hould immediately remove from a ft at ion â¢
within the jurifdiftion of the United States where
he had violated their rights ; and further to make
known to him,, that in forty-eight hours after the
requisition (hould be communicated to him, all in
tercourse between the United States and his (hip'
would be forbidden. I is very true that the Ex
equatur of the British Vice-Consul was wilhdfawn
expressly for his knowingly tranfmittihg to the
Governor of Rhode-Island a moll insulting letter
from captain Home: becatife altho'he was on board
the Africa when the attempt was madeagainft Mr.
Fauchet, the Prefideat had no evidence of his co
operation. The Mmifter of the United States in
Lor don, was directed to represent to that Court
the conduct of capt. Home, and to iemand his
exemplary punishment. It was not to be expefteth
that he would be judged unheard j and consequent
ly much delay muff have ensued. From her liation
ontfe coall ttf North Amenca, the Africa went
to the Weft Indies. Seeing sometime since by an
article in the news-papers that the Africa waÃ re
turning to England, our Minilter in London was
reminded of tin's affair, that tlie demand of fatisfac
tian might be renewed.

may, with truth, anticipate the highcft gratification
: from its representation. The abilities of the painter
and machinifl have been driven to the?;/ plus ultra of
: their refpeftivc employments, to furnilh the (uitable
appendages. The masterly pencil of Milbourne has
been long and fufficiently engaged in producing the

The expedition which has been sent to Flushing, fail

mand of major Doyle and captain O/burne, by whom
it is said to have been planned. It was conduced with
great secrecy, but it has not proved fuccefsful. The
i'quadroÃ consisted of the Robust and Ramillies men of
war, besides several gun-boats and sire-ships, and had
1 joc land troops on board. The object was to frt fire
to the shipping in the Texel; but on reconnoitring the
harbour, a council of war was summoned, when it
was resolved that the expedition was impracticable.

SEtRETARY's OmCE.
As continuance of a number of merchant's
vcflels in this port, would be attended with the
mod lerious evils, at a time when they cannot be
tupplied from the gart ifon with provifiÂ»Â«, waver, or
firing, and wfien there is a greater probability ef
their being set on fire by the etumy than tfcaping,
and as the present favorable opportunity of their
being protected through the ttreights by.admiral
Matin's squadron, who will possibly give them fafe
convoy to Lifb#n, is an advantage not likely to hap
pen again in 3 time, and as these vcflVls,
bring either set on lire or droye on shore, (a casual
ty to which they would be very liable where they
now anchor) might be prejudicial to the fafety of
the place : under these circumstances, I think i
neeeffary to give dire&ions to every Btitifh veflcl,
new is tlie place, to hold themselves in readiness tof

CHARLESTON, Jan. 6. /
Capt. Smith in the fliip Ga:far, from the Cape
of Good Hope, on his passage here touched at the
island of Ascension, where .the following intelli
gence was communicated to him in writing :
"All the settlements of the Dntch in India, ate
given up to the Euglifh, as well on the East as on
she Wert fide, except Macctffcr and the island Â«f
Java. That Banda waÂ« given tip was the lafl news
we heard before we left Batavia, which was on the
13th of June 1796. The inhabitants of Batavia
expected the Eniilifh at the island of Java in the
month of August. L'he teprefentative of the prince
of Orange, who in that eliara&tr has the chief
command of the Dutch settlements ir. India, was
informed by the Englifli when t_hey went thrÂ«-the
ftraiti of Balic to the Molucca islands, that they
would visit Java at that time. This gives great
uneasiness to the iohabitanrs. The old general and
his son, the dire&or, were busy in making prepa
rations to receive them. The faldiers who former
ly wore a blue uniform with white lappels a,ul *
white feather; were a few d iys Uffore. our depar
ture drefled in blue and orange, and wore an o
range coloured feather.
" The sjovernor of Malacca fold 200 Sepoys
and 180 Hanoverians together with two frigates, to
clear himfelf of a debt he owed of 200,000 rix
dollars. In the Molucca Islands every thirg is car
ried on in thÂ« fame way, owing to the conduct of
the Hew governor of Amboyna, Mr. Cornabe, whÂ®
was formerly at Tinnate.
" The representative of the Prince ef Orange,
who commands a great parcel of rascals and vaga.
hands, principally great ones, intends to call upon
the gentlemen in the service of the company to de
liver up to the EiijJifh too millions of Dutch mo
ney, whieh will berated at 150 millions; tl.ey will
have a particular interest in doing this, as ir will be
the means of clearing them from the bankruptcy

That they are desirous, from motives both of pub
lio and private interest, to promote the establishment of
a Company for erefling a. permanent Bridge over the
river Schuylkill, at or near the City of Philadelphia.
ThÂ«y therefore pray the Legislature, that they will
be pimfed to permit them to bring in a Bill, for incor
porating fufih persons as Will associate for that purpose,
into a Body corporate, on the plan hereunto annexed.
And your Memorialists will ever pray, fcc.
Philadelphia, January 25th, 1797.
PLAN for the establishment of a Company, to be in
corporated by the Legislature of Pcnnfylvania (if
such incorporation (hall to that Legislature seem
proper) by the name and title of " The Company
for erefling a Bridge over the river Schuylkill, at
or near the City of Philadelphia."
1. Five commissioners to be appointed by the Legis
lature to open a Subscription for 15,000 Ibares of 10
dollars each. Ten per cent of the sum fubferibed to be
paid at the time of fubfcrlbing, and ten per cent in
three months. The remainder to be paid at such times,
and in fueh proportions as the Direflors of the Compa
ny shall think proper. Any person failing to make
future payments, to forfeit, for the use of the Corpo
ration, all payments previously made ; and it shall be
lawful for any body politic, co-partnership, or person,
to fubferibe for as many (hares as they, he or (he Ihall
think fit, not exceeding in any one day, Bat
thousand ibares Ihall be reserved for the ptirpofes here
in after mentioned ; and to enable the Corporation
therewith to purchase, if the fame can be accomplifh
Â«d by this means, a fcite or place deemed eligible for
the erection of of a bridge :
a. The Fund to be applied by the company, nndtr
the fuperiatendance of such person or persons as they
shall think proper, to the ereflion and mainteeance of
a permanent Bridge within years over the river
Schuylkill, at or near the City of Philadelphia, at a
place convenient for the communication of the city
with the western parts of the country. A general des
cription of the Bridge to be mentioned in the A&.
But the company, or those invested by them with the
direflion of their affairs, may deviate from such <ief
cription, in any details thought by thewC more conven
ient 01 proper ; preserving the substantial parts of the
plan described.
3. The Company to be allowed a toll not exceeding
the rates taken at the present Corporation Bridge, for
any pafTengers, carriages or commodities. But no
more than three fourths of fueh rates Ihall be taken for
the paflage of the produce of the country, merchan
dise and manure. But when the said tolls Ihall ex
ceed per cent, nett annual profit, the one half of
the excess Ihall eompefe a fund for the redemption of
the Bridge, fs as to render it free, save that there Ihall
always be a small toll or other revenue for keeping it
in repair. This moiety of the excess Ihall be laid out
in Bridge Stock, or other productive Funds ; and the
dividends thereof fha!l be also added to this fund, and
invested in like manner. The other half fball become
part of the dividend for the benefit of the Company.
4. The Company to be allowed to hold the said
Bridge for twenty-five years : But if, by the operation
of the fund heretofore and hereafter proposed, there
ihall be a Efficient sum to free the Bridge at a period
less than the said twenty-five years, then it shall be re
deemed and become free, on the Stockholders being
paid the appraised value thereof as herein after men
tioned. If the said fund Ihall not be adequate to the
purpose last mentioned, the Legislature may, at the
expiration of the said twenty-five years declare it a free
Bridge (providiug at the fame time the means of keep,
ing it in repair) and the Company (hall be obliged to
take such sum of money therefor as Ihall be allowed en
a fair appraisement, by indifferent persons. The like
appraisement Ihall take place, wMen the finking fund is
is adequate to the redemption of the bridge, and the
establishment of a revenue, if a toll be not thought
more eligible for keeping the bridge in repair.
5. The Commissioners before mentioned shall call
a meeting of the stockholders, immediately on the sub
scription being filled ; (except the reserved shares)
and that meeting shall appoint five of their number, to
examine and report the mod eligible places for build
ing the b' idge and to treat with any bodies politic
or corporate, or individuals for the purchase of their
refpeflive rights, or any of them, to the place or pla
ces deemed eligible. And when the said place or pla
ces, and the terms on which it or they can be purchas
ed, are so reported, the said stockholders, or a majority
of them, shall fix on the terras and place. Or the
said stockholders or a majority of them, may then
agree to leave the determination, both ou place and
terms, to the Dire&tfrs, to be chosen as herein after
mentioned.
6. The ftockholdersfto be allowed to choose twelve
Directors annually, and make By Laws for the govern
ment of tbe affairs of the company.
7. Semi annual dividends to be made.
8. If the Legislature shall be pleased, at the time
of passing this adt, or within twelve months thereafter,
to grant a sum of money towards erefling the bridge,
such sum shall be laid out in Ihares ; and the sum so
granted, together with the dividends thereon anting
from time to time, whirh Ihall also be invested in bridge
ftoek, or other productive tunds; (ball be added to the
finking fund herein before proposed for freeing the
bridge.
9. Donations'from individuals, given within J2
months after passing the ail of incorporation, for
freeisg the Bridge, (hall be received, invested as
keretofore mentioned, and added to the finking fund.
