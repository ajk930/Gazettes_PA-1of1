HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, a'
_ tl
Thuhsgay, May 10. I d
(Continued from ( TueJday % s Gazette.) | o
Mr. Sumpter. was opposed to the prit.- j
ciple ol the bill, and difapprovt-d the objefts j)
it had in contemplation to effect ; but above
all he was opposed to the principle contained ),
in the firft feQion, namely, that of transfer- t |
ring the constitutional lej^iflativ- p 'wer of (j
Congress, to the President or Executive â
branch of the government. Gentlemen who {,
advocate this principle, being well apprized j,
that pointed and constitutional objection* ,
may be nrgtd against them, have thought f,
proper to draw to their support some prece-
dents in which Congrefa have made a trans., j
fer of their powers ; those precedents he t(
said could not be expeftcd to have iruch t
weight with him ; indeed they had no â
weight, for error could never be (auctioned
by being
questions had been agitated in
which had met with various fates ; but what f
ever the decisions might have been, lie had t
uniformly voted ag'ainit the principle of v
transferring power from one branch of the f
government to the other. j
Having been then in uniform opposition to j
the principle on every occasion, it was not to (
be expeftid that he should concur in its e- (
ftablilhment on the present, elpecial'j as the ,
pi opofed measure appeared to him to be high- ]
ly momentous, involving in it the peace, the ,
happinefsand even thelibcrty of his country. ,
Nay, so far from its being to be estp fled (
that he (hould throw in Wis vote of approba - |
tion, it was to be expefted (and he would ,
not deceive that expeftation) that he (hould i ,
be more earned ia his opposition ; and be- .
lieving that there was no neceflity for raising | j
a provisional, or any i'.rmy, at this time, he j ]
intended to vote the whole bill.
He recommended to the committee to i
take a comprehensive view of our situation, !
before they engaged in a system of such im
| menfe expence, iu doing which he said they
I would neceffariiy turn their attention to '
what is palling among the nations of Eu- j
ropeâby one of these nations it was said,
the United States are imminently threatened; (
gentlemen urge it ftron;ly as a thing certain
and at hand, that we are to apprehend eve
ry species of attackâbut notwiihftanding all j
that had been ' eneated over and over on j
this head. He ft.'.! differed in opinion with
those RCntlemen. as to what was likely to be ;
the itfue. He bad attended to all the in- j
formation which had been disclosed, he had j
â¢ iiftened pati' Ltly to gentlemen's speculations, \
! and hsd contemplated as far as his mind was j
repi'oje of bearing him thro' the refearch,a:!d i
that too with greu folic : 'un â¢ hi i
the situation of the Uni'ed States, as tliey
(lood connected vith a certain European
power. He had not been able to discover,
1 nor did he believe, that we have any cau eto
apprehend an immediate invasion from that
quarter ânor was he inclined to believe that
even luch an intention existedâbut even it if.'
; did, will any man, who is capable of forming
! a judgment of the preient state of things
there, and what they are likely to be lor a
confideiable length of time to come, fay that
there is not ample employ meni for their ener
gies, that there are not difficulties of such
â¢ magnitude in the way as will secure us jfrom
' an invasion for a longer period than those
' gentlemen who have expressed cheir alarm,
t have thought proper to foretell ? For hiÂ»
: part, he had no doubt but this was the cafe,
â  be felt surprized, indeed, at finding gentle
men so apprehensive of danger fiotn this
' quarter, that they were not content with an
t additional army of 10,000 mea, as reported
â¢ by the fcleA committee, bu> for employing
20,000, the number propofeJ by the Senate.
' Nay some of them did not even thick
themselves secure, unless the number was
. extended to 50,000, for even that number
has been advocated 011 this floor, but have
' genflemen no feeling for their ConftituenU :
â¢ will'thev drain their pockets to the last c?nt ?
The Committee are informed that the annu
" al expence of 10 000 men will not be de
frayed under four millions of dollars ; but
this information is not accurate, 4 millions of
1 dollars, will be found inadequate, when we
I come to bring into the account the large
! items of expence necefiary ths moment such
t a force is put in motion, even theexpeuce of
1. four millions of dollars will be found great,
perhaps unbearable, but what would the ex
t pence be, if it was made commenturate with
the apprehtnfions of those who are moll
alarmed.
This favorite scheme of raising a (landing
d army, piull be pulhed forward by every aid
II of Ju3 and fSion, and that its success may
e be iafured, the fouthein members are to be
tetrified into its adoption, for we are v Id,
that the fouthsrn fta es have much to
'' that thert is every reason to believe the
souther:. dates will be fpeedil* invaded by a
mercileft and vindictive foe from the Weft
o I idits. That at this moment, thousands
r< may be difgorgingon our (liores.that they are
is prepared to ttrike. And the gentleman
y from South-Carolina (Mr. Harpisi*. one of
g h;s colleagues) has in the height of his zeal
n sot American defence, or his. fears for the
fafety of the southern dates, or from some
1( other cause, which he did not pretend to di
d vine, by his nice and minute delineations of
the condition of the southern states. (hewn
d to the house a terrifying pifiure of southern
n imbecility, and had also publifhe.i to this
lc cruel, maliciitK and in lid nous enemy (as he
IC terms them) an enemy fuÃLiently penetrat

them to take in attack, he hasexpofed our
mo ft vulnerable parts to their inveteracy,
and our wealthielt part to their rapacity !
the policy or prudence which di&ated the
detail,-he did not flop to examine, but went
on to ask, supposing these marauder's were
disposed to invade the southern Hates, wlie*
ther it would not be allowed that they were
too fully and completely occupied nearer
home, to be at liberty to execute at this time,
their inteii'ions of such an invalioii ? For
his part, he thought such waÂ» their conditi
on, and cxpe&td it woud continue to bÂ« fa
for some time to come ; but admitting that
itiÂ« possible for the man w'no has bten men
tioned, to invade our coalt with the three or
four thousand men spoken of, the conse
quences predicted are not likely to follow.â
i'hr reasoning ofiis colleague being admit
ted, perhaps hi" conclusions might ulfo ; but
the former not being just, the latter could
nnt result.
He was aw?re that the number of inhabi
tants of the lower couutry cf the states of
Georgia, South and North-Carolina. a*
stated by his colleague was not ve> y rcat j
but he did not consent to the deduftion
which the genlleman lad made, uiat, there
fore, the lower country waÂ« very weak in
point of force, to 01 pole an invasion. And
here he deemed it proper to notice the : :â *
tempt which had been made to dr.iw invidi
ous diftinflior.s between the militia force of
our country, and what are termed regu
lars ; attempts conftandy made by the fidvi>-
| cates of Handing armies, not only on this
i occasion but on many others ; not only on
! this floor, but in the other branch of the
legislature, and very lately, in a very point
ed manner by his colleague (Mr. Harper)
who prefled the establishment of a lia iding
army by depressing the manly charafter of his
| fellow citizens, he (Mr. Harder) had f id
i he was well acquainted with ihe southern
! states, that the inhabitants on the seaboard
| are few, that for jo or 60 miles they are
ftil fewer, that the Uroag'pop'ilaiion is quit*
! remote, that the whole in jeneral are badly
. armed, many altogether without arms ;
; that they are not well organized, and even
j if they were, they are net to be depended
upon, unless headed and aided by regular
1 troops ; in (hort, that no good can be ex
pefled from the militia, unless they are fup
porced by regulars,
j Now. said Mr. S. admitting my colleague
I to know something of the geographical situ
ation of the country he has attempted to de
i liniate by such an unfavourable dtfeription,
I neither he nor his conftituer.u ought to be
! surprized if I allure him, that if hij know
j lfdge of the military prowess of his country*
i men is so limited aa his dtfeription indicates
! it amounts to little or nothing at all ; the
1 true force of the southern states tn defend
thetrttyves, catjnot be doubud fc>y wlÂ«*
were attentive observers o'. its exertion thro'
our revolutionary war. AnJ the militia,
notwithstanding its defairtrs, fffe&ed much.
All the corps were not of t,' ,e dtfeription of
that to which hiacollei, ve laid he orce be-
he (Mr. Harplr) kad laid*that the
corps of which he had been a member was as
refpcftable a any whatever, but he had re
marked while he belonged to it th.it they
were generally difiatisficd, always in d'for
der, and when drawn ir.tA ftrvice always re
laxing from difcipliue, quitting thÂ« corps
1 and returning home without leave, and not to
be kept together or ai all to be depended
' upon, unless when a&ing with or led on
1 by regular troops. Heie Mr. S. ohferv d
â¢ that he had had an opportunity ot feeing the
commanding officer cf the co ps to which.
' his colleague had fahf he belonged, within
two months after the corps was raised, then
1 on a tour ot duty with the fonthern army,
I and it eviuced to his tntnd that there wa*
femewhat of that want of difcipliue, and de
; sir f e tube or remain at home among some of
1 the corps, for he really had no recollection
' of feeing him with his officers, and there
: may be some reason to conjeffuie that he
â  had not accompanied him on that tour of du
â  iy : if so, it will no longer be wondered at
that the gentleman intiftson placing 110 con
- tjdence in militia men generally, and if he
t Mr. S. was to detail what he Kid . itneffed
f of the strength, of the means and of the dif
; position cf the southern tmiitia it would go
! to fnew that he (Mr. H.) not being on the
1 ground, has less knowledge of the fnbjeft
f than he is desirous of being believed to
1 pofTefs.
It is an unpleasant thing said Mr. S. for
1 me to have to make any remarks on a fub
-1 jest of this fort ; hut so frequently have gen
tlemen made invidious dillinilions between
I the courage and efficacy of militia and regu
d lars and with so much jnjuftice to the for
y mer ; that I cannot permit thei<- atfertions
e any longer to pass without notice. For do-
I, ing this, Ido not meai.' to derogate from
', (he raerit of the late AmtWcan regular army
e nor more particularly from that part of it
a which fcrved to the southward, of whose
> condition I can bettÂ«r judge than of that
s which served in the midule and eastern dil
e tiifti ; as to {hem, I am b.ld to fay, they
n were rot inferior, under all circumfhmces,
if to any army of equal numbers and equal o Ji
ll portunities, which I have heard or read cf,
e in anytime or in any placeâbut then it mi.ft
e be also remembered, whatever gentlenrvn
i- may here fay to the contrary, that the militia
>f were as serviceable, and as fuccsfsful as any
II regulars whatever,
n He said he would take a rurfory review
is of the services of the militia in one of the
ie southern states which v ould tend to support
t- his last declaration.
c- He would quote o*!y a few cases ont of a
>r great number whfre the milits#' had afted a-one, without My co-operation or support <
iroiti tlie it alar., and Li Â«t against the ve'e- 1
ran and conquering cavalry and infantry ol
firi irti corpj, and in which aftions they were ;
dilli .guilhed for their bravery an<J success. ]
It may be remembered th.it very partial if any
impressions had ever been made by our regu
lar troips on the Britilh corps of cavalry du- :
ri;i|T the early period of the war ; and it
framed to be rcferved to the font hern militia
m convirfce them that their eqaals exiftd in
our country. It is not to be attributed to
the want of courage or discipline in our te
gular corps that this had n> t been done be
fore, but to imperious circumstances which
no Ikill could overcome, but this did not
change the faft.
After the fall of Charlcfton in 1780. the
firft aftion, and that fought by the militia,
without any aid fr >m our regulars, was the
aft on of Filhing crtik, where without en. j
terinjf into a minute description of all the :
circumstances attendant on luch an occsfion, â 
it wiil be fufScient to fay, that the gallant j
captain Ronke who commanded a fqtiadron
of Tarlton's legion fell, and the whole force
was beaten and difperLd.
A few day c after, and here permit me said
Mr. S. to rtÂ»Ark, tlia if roy co league does
not remtmber, and our historians have neg.
lefUd to record the atchievnients of the mi
litia, y t jurtice is in f. me dtgjree done them
by A Sri ifh Hifiorian, who was an office'
in the Britilh service in tha- part of on coun
try, and at the very time I am speaking of,
who corroborates my fails. A few days af
ter an attack was rfu.de by the niilit a on
Rocky M(V t, and Col. Turnbull who com
manded the ei-cmies force, and who is now
â¢n New Y rk, I have no doubt hai candour
enough to acknowledge, that from the con
test he had with them (although strongly de
feated by well conftrufted works) and which
lasted ! n hourt, there is something due to
their bravery and the effeft of their arms.
Eight days after the affair on Rocky
Mount, an attack was made on the Brit ifh
at their polls of the Hanging Rock. The
force on this occasion cot.fifted of the fame
corps of South Carolina militia whehad enter
prized on the other occasion ; they were in
number about 600 ; they had been joinedby a
few of the militia from North Carolina, and
it is n pleasure to refleft on the cordiality and
bravery difplayei by then on this occasion.
The enemy's force at this pall was 1200
tffe6tive< ; yet the tefult wj>, af.er an acti
on which lasted thro'the greateftpart of the
day, that major Bryan's corps was totally de- |
seated, the Prince of Wales' regiment exter
minated, even 'is name has never since been j
recorded. Other detachments from the
63d and 7til under the command of major
Garden were also cut up, driven from their
encampment wi h the entire loss ofbaggage,
&c. , and, in the course of this aftion, cap
tain Kjnlaw, vvi h a Iquadron of Tarlcton's
Legion arrived from Rocky Mount, made 3
d fperate charge on the militia, was repul
sed by them and fled to Camden, without
attempting to renew the combat. In this,
as well as other aftions, it to be re
membered, how many field officers, brave
crptaine and ether officers, as well as
valuable citizens fell, or were wounded,
while at'ither nation had to regret in this
attim alone, the loss of upwards of 800 men.
P ifing by a number of important and
considerable cor Bids which took place be
tween the Britilh regulars and the Southern
militia, still unsupported by regulars of our
own army, said Mr. S. I come now to men
tion the attack which was made in the neigh
bourhood of Winnefborough, while Lord
Cornwallislaid in that t wn, upon the S uth
Carolina militia by a Britilh regulir force
under majors Wymes and M'Carther, sup,.
ported by two tro r ps of cavalry the wlv le
corps drawn together and formed for the
ptirpofe, after various charges made by the
infantry and cavalry, and after repeated re
pulses, the encny was totally repelled, their
commanding (.fficer wounded and taken, to
getber wi h a number of his corps, and the
veil were dispersed.
On the return of colonel Tarleton to
Winnefborough, another effort was made,
and from the number as well as the nature
of the troops employed, it was certainly in
tended to be effedlual in driving the South
Carolina militia from that part of the coun
try; for it wasTarleton's legion, M'Carthy's
corps, and that part of the 63d under Major
Money, wlvch tnops were ltd to the attack
of the miiitia on the 20th of November, the
result of this aftion. is known, to those who
do not wilh to detraft from the merit
of the militia. The enemy's detachment
consisted of 270 leginary horle, and upwards
of 400 regular infantry, with two field pie
ce" ; the militia were between 5 and 600
without (as indeed they were thro' a 1 the
aftions I have described) a single piece of
atriillery. In the numb-'r of .nilitia are in
cluded some Georgians, who not only acquired
honor to themselves from their exertions on
that day, but did honor to their country.
'J he fate of the Britilh cavalry was then de
cided ; they had been formerly unconque
rable, but after that day they were never
known to be brought to aft with either ener
gy oi* elfcft.
Knowing the ardor and firmnefs of the
fouthera militia, and not doubting but the
militia of the several Hates in ihe Union,
pofitfs equal motives tor their exertions,
equal spirit and aftivity, I cannot, said
Mr. S. but rely on them as the natural and
main fuppori of our national independenceâ
a support fully effeftual without a recurrence
to a (landing army. These few cases, and
it is flopping very fiiort indeÂ»d of what the
merits of the fouthcrn militia deserve, tend
to (hew that the charges brought againlitbe
militia generally are as unfounded as they
are cruel to their feelings ; while at the feme
time they demonstrate, that if an invasion
(which is a contingency by no means likely
to happen) Ihould aftujlly take place, v?e
may rely with confidence on the manly ex.
enions of the militia, to meet the attack,
and to re fx ft every effort, at lead for such a
period a 9 until more effeftive aid (hall be
drawn down to their support, and more per
maaent measures adopted.
Mr. S. concluded with faying, that near
a million of dollars had been appropriated
for the purchase of artillery and small a> ms ;
350,000 for additional for ifications and
80 000 for fitting galliea. He wished the
appropriation for the gaUita to have been
increafcd, by taking a par' from the sum
appropi rated for additional fortifications : as
he conceived from the nature of the attacks
or injuries to which our sea-board is exposed,
it would furnilh the motl expeditious and
effectual means of fafety to the inhabitants
who might be threatened ; if to thil mean of
riefence, were added the vigilence, a&ivity
and firmnefs of the m litia, he thought gen
tlemen might con fide r themselves tolerably
fife, without rcforting to that worst of all 1
expedients a (landing army; especially, if
j they believed wirh him that the danger of an
; invasion from Europe was very remote in
! deed ; and that from the Weft-lodies not
| likely to take place for want of opportuni
ty, even admitting such an intention is en
tertained. Under this view of the fubje&,
he wished the question of raising an army to
remain umkeided until a future fcfTioo of
Congress ; âand from the reasons and argu- j
ments he had urged, he was influenced not
only to vote againll the firft fe&icn, but the
whole bill generallyâunder a hope, that
Congress might rely on the natural force of
the conn iy, on which alone ihey could deâ
peed in all cases of extreme danger, and
without which neither a (landing army or a
navy, or flrong holds or fortitocations would
be a security for our political exillence or
independence as a nation.
Mr. J. Williams believed there was but
little real difference of opinion betwixt those
whr> were in favour of ftrikingout the fiifl
fettion, and those opposed to it . The former
suppose an army will Jje necessary in cafe of
war, or an invasion, and the latter wish to give
the President the power to raise the men in
cafe the danger of either was very great. He
(hould vote for retaining the firlt feftion;
though, as it flood at present, he did not alto
gether like it. If the motion for (triking out
was loft, he Hiould move to amend it by con
fining the exercise of the power proposed to be
given to the President, to the receis of Con
gress. He truited gentlemen would not be
willing that Congress fliould rife without
something more being done for the defence
of the country than has been done. No one
could fay how soon an attack might be nude
upon us, and whenever it was made, we ought
certainly to be in afituation to repel it, which
would not be the cafe, except a bill of this
kind was pafTed.
A resolution had been laid upon the table,
he said to increase our Standing Force to 10,000
men; but it might happen that no neceflity
would arise for increaling our present force.
He wiflied only that the President might have
the power of increasing, it, if there Ihould be
occasion to do so.
Gentlemen had said much in defence of the
Militia of this country. Had he heard any
thing said derogatory to the bravery of our
Militia, he fliould long since have risen in
their defence. No man could doubt for a mo
ment that the Militia of this country are as
brave as any in the world.
He was astonished to hear the gentleman
from Tennessee fay that when Regulars and
Militia aft together, they generally quarrel.
Thisaffertion must have anfen from his want
of experience. He wa3 himfelf for eight years
engaged in the war, and never saw any thing
to juftify the remark. The plains of Saratoga
spoke for themselves. At Bennington the Mi
litiaconquered superior numbers, in the second
aftion they were, it is true, joined by Conti
nental troops. But why recount these things ?
It was idle to suppose regular troops and mi
litia fliould quarrel with each other, lince
they all fight in the fame caui'e, and with the
fame feelings. No better troops could be em
ployed than Militia in a sudden emergency ;
but, as had been already stated, they icmain
ed impatiently in the field for any length of
time.
Considering the extenfivenefsof onr expos
ed lea coast, it could not be supposed that
our present small number of standing troops,
could be fuffirient for the present situation of
things. Militia ought not to be called from
their families and occupations, except in par
ticular emergencies. As to any danger to be
dreaded from an army of this kind tothe liber
ties of the country it was a mere phantom, and
he thought it was paying but little refpett to
our Militia to suppose the liberties of the
country could be endangered by a regular
force of 10 or 20,000 men ! Beiides it would
be attended with less expence to raise these
men, that to call out the Militia from time
to time. He had something to do in the draft
ing of militia in 1794, and in consequence of
i the law of last session, and knew the difficulty
attending it. Not one out of five who was
drafted could leave his family. These people
were obliged to find men in their stead, which
they did at from 15 to 20 dollars. To call the
1 Militia from the part of the country where he
lived, which was betwixt 3 400 miles from
the sea coast, would be attended with great
; inconvenience indeed. He hoped this bill
would pass ; if not, he forefaw great expence.
We must augment our present army, and per
haps Congress would have occasion to fit here
all summer, for they could not adjourn until
some farther provilion was made for the de
fence of the country. It was true, the President
might call into service a part of the 80,000
Militia held in requisition, but it would be
attended with great expence and inconveni
ence, which he wiflied to avoid, by palling this
bill.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, Af.<r 25.
CONGRESS.
Ycflerday, the House of Representatives of the
United States, resumed the difcuflion of Mr. Sit
greaves's resolutions for inftrudting the comman
ders of our public and private armed vefiels; and
the motion for a postponement of the consideration,
of these resolutions until thefecond Tuefdayin June
being again under consideration, after a few words
againlt the motion by Mr. Hartley, the queftkn
was put and negatived 43 to 37. The question then
returned upon a reference of them to a committee
o? the whole, which was negatived,there being only
21 votes for it. The resolutions were then referred,
agreeably to the original proposition of the mover,
to the Committee for the prote&ion of commerce
and the defence of the country, to report by bill or
other wife. The bill from the Senate for the farther
prote<Â£tjon of the commerce and coafls of the United
States, was referred to the fime committee. The
Houie ipent the remainder of the fitting on a bill
providing for the more effe&ual colledion of certain
internal revenues of the United States, which was
finally agreed to, and ordered to be engrofled for a
third reading to-day.
At a psblic meeting of the citizens of Bohemia Ma
nor and SafTafras Neck, in Cecil county slate of
Maryland, the following address was unanimouf
lyappioved, and dire&ed to be forwarded by the
Chairman to their representative in Congress, to be
prefenied
To thi PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
AS portion of the people of this government,
paiticipaiiog in the advantages refilling from well
fecurcd freedom, we cannot remain indifferent to the
manifold injuries, which, in violation of a solemn
treaty and the laws of nations are daily infli&ed on
our fellow citizens- Nor can we view with apathy
the reiterated indignities and outrages offered to the
government of our choice.
Although we are not engaged in commerce, we are
sensible of its importance to our interests as cultiva
tors of the earth, we therefore consider ourfelvc*
bound by that consideration, as well as the obligation
of tnu'ual concefton to our fellow-citizens who pur
sue commerce, to contribute to its proteftion. We
also mod firmly believe that the interests of the peo
pleandof the government are as intimately blended
as those of agriculture and commerce ; and we hold
all attempts to separate the one from the other, in ut
ter deteftat'on.
If, as has teen insultingly insinuated, or ratheT as
serted, there is a faction in this government so loft to
American feelings, as to espouse the unjust and arro
gant pretensions of a foreign nation, we beg leave to
allure you that we are not of that d,efcription. And
we truftthat very few will be found so unworthy the
bleflings they enjoy.
Whilst we sincerely lament that the prudent and
pacific steps taken by our chief magistrate to preserve
peace, so defireable to all nations, are likely to fail of
the wished for effeft, we highly applaud the policy of
such temperate proceedings. Seeing in them a fia
cere and ardent desire to promote and accelerate an
accommodation with the republic of France, on terms
compatible with the rights, duties, interests and hon
or of the nation, we are encouraged to place addition
al confidence in the integrity and wisdom of thecon
ftituted authorities ; and the more readily to promise
our willing aid in support of such measures as may
be adopted by them in the present unhappy situation
of our public concerns.
We pray you, fir, to accept our best wishes for the
prolongation of your life, hitherto so eminently dif
tinguilhcd for its ufefulnefs and patriotism, and that
it may be blefied with the enjoyment of every happi
ness.

ANSWER.
To the citizens of Bohemia KJanor, and saffafras Neck, in
Cecil county, in the slate oj Maryland.
Cent LEMEk,
I thank, you for this address. it would be unac
countable indeed, if any portion of a people, who
acknowledge a participation in the advantages refus
ing from well secured freedom, could be indifferent
to the manifolq injuries which in violation of a so
lemn treaty and the laws of nations, are diily inflift
ed on our fellow citizens, or view with apathy the
reiterated indignities and outrages offered to the gov
ernment of their choice#
The importanceof commerce to the interests of the
cultivators of theearth, is so obvious, that at lea ft as
much zeal has appeared for its proto&ion in the land
ed interests as the monied interest, in farmers as in
Merchants, in country citizens as in navigators.
If the interests of the people and of the govern
ment aTe not as intimately blended as thofc of agri
culture and commerce in an eleflive government, in
what other form can they be more so ? Will those
who attempt to separate the one from the other pre
tend that in hereditary governments they are more so ?
or under military conquerors ?
I believe with yÂ«u that very few will be found so
unworthy of thÂ« bleflings they enjoy, as to espouse
the unjust and arrogant pretensions of a foreign nation,
yet we have found that a few venal prcttes, and un
principled mercenaries have been able to raise loud
clamors, produce much discontent, and threat
en serious calamities.
Theexpreflion*of your fatisfa&ion and confidence,
as well as the promise of your willing aid, in sup
port of such measures as may be adopted in the pre
sent unhappy situation of our public concerns, arc ve
ry agreeable.
For your kind wishes for the prolongation of my
life, I return you miue, for every blefling on you and
posterity.

In the address to the President, from the
Students of Harvard College,after noticing
the manoeuvres of France among the powers
of Europe and the recent propositions for
making us their disgraced, humbled tribu
taries, they fay ;
Â« We have seen this, Sir, and our youth
ful blood has belled within us. When, in
apportion to such conduct, we contemplate
the measures of our own government, we
cannot but admire and venerate the unfnl
lied integrity, the # decifive prudence, and
dignified firmnefs, which have uniformly
chara&er/fed your adminjftration. lmpreffed
with these sentiments, we now solemnly offer
the unwafted ardor and unimpaired energies
of our youth to the service of our country.
Our lives are our only property y and we
were not the sons of those who sealed our
liberties with thcit blood, if we would not
defend with these lives that foil, which now
affords a peaceful grave to the mouldering
bones of our forefathers."

GENTLEMEN,
NEXT to the approbation of a good
conscience, there is nothing perhaps which
gives us more pleasure than the praise of
those we love most, and who know us the
most intimately.
I could not receive your addressâin
which I read with pleasure iaexpreffible,
the names of Clergy and Laity; Officers
and Soldiers ; Magistrates and Citizens of
every denomination ; among whom were
the mod aged, whose countenances I had
refpe&ed ; my fchool-fellows and the com
panions of my childhood, whom I had
loved from the cradle ; âwithout the live-
Heft emotions of gratitude and affe&ion.
With you, my kind neighbours, I have
ever lived in habits of freedom, friendfhip,
and familiarity ; we have always agreed
very well in principles and opinions ; and
well knowing your love of your country I
and ardour in its defence, your explicit j
declaration upon this occasion, though un- j
expe&ed, is no surprise to me. Accept of ,
the best wishes of a sincere and faithful
friend, for a continuance of harmony among
you, and for the prosperity of all your in
terests.

At a numerous and refpeftable meeting of the c't
tizens cf Upper Freeholds in the county of Mon
mouth, and of those in its vicinity from the
counties of Burlington and Midd/efex, in the
State of New-Jersey, convened agreeably to
public notice for the purpose of taking into con
sideration the political situation of the Un:ted
States, Robert Montgom *ry, esq.
c,was unanimously eleSed chairman, and
Elisha Lawrence,,efq. Jec*y.
When the following persons were unanimous
ly Appointed a committee to draught an address
to the President, the Senate, and House of Re
presentatives of the United States : âviz. Robert
Montgomery, John Imlay, col. Samuel Quay,
George Woodward, Daniel Sexton, Robert
Wilson, Joseph Holmes, capt. Robert Cham
bers, John Lloyd and Elifba Lawrence, who af
ter retiring a short time, reported the following
address :
Viewing with pleasure, and congenial senti
ments the many rsfpedlable addrefTes, presented
at this alarming and critical period, we beg leave
to jo'n our aflurances of approbation, of the
dignified exertions of the President, to secure
the peace and prosperity of our country, and
our firm reliance in the wisdom and patriotism
of the Rational legislature. We have read with
indignation, the base attempts made upon the
honor of our ministers in France, and through
them upon that of the United States. We con
template with pleasure, as the best proof cf the
j wisdom cf their appointment, the firm, manly
and patriotic manner in which those attempts
I were repelled, and the henor which the condutf
exhib ted by our commifTiotters to the French re
| public, cannot fail to refleil on the American
| name.
| Sensible of, and grateful for the bleflings we
enjoy, under the government of our choice, we
view with equal abhorrencp, the idea of crouch
ing to the servile terms of foreign taik-mafters ;
and the baneful conduft of those among our
selves, whose influence, if not speedily checked
will be found to be a canker, praying upon the
root of that independence, purchased with blood
and which we will resign but with our lives.
As our fields have Scarcely recovered from the
ravages of eur revolutionary war, during which
awful time, the state in which we live was fre
quently the scene of a&ion, a remembrance of
those days of difficulty, cannot fail to give a zest
tÂ® our hard earned freedomâwhile the recollec
tion, that the great and illuflrious chiej flill lives,
who led to conquest and to glory, will, we trust
if neceflary lighten the embers in the heart of
age, and inspire our youth to emulite the praifc
worthy example of those in the metropolis.
We deplore the mistaken policy of France,
founded in injustice and ingratitude,and we fear,
aided by treachery.
The horrors of war excite our keenest sensi
bility, but we prefer them infinitely to the base
surrender of a single right.
The firm, moderate and unfhalten patriotism
of our President upon the present occasion, de
mands our gratitude and thanks. It inspires us
also with confidence to acquiesce in every mea
sure which the national legislature shall in their
wildom direct, or the temerity of our enemies
make necessary.
Resolved, That the chairman do sign the tore
going address, and transmit a copy thereof to
the President of the United States, and both
houses of Congress.

To the Editor of the Gazette of the United States.
S 1 R,
THE following pafTages, taken from the
History of Greece, are so appropriate to
the present crisis, that I am tempted to re
quest a place for them in your Gazette.
They offer an impreflive lesson. Let us
weigh well the danger of disunion at home,
while the acurfed lust of un verfal domina
tion threatens our independence from abroad.
Treating of tLe Achaean leagueâthat me
morable league, whose object was the re
covery of the long-loft liberties of Greece,
which intestine divisions excited by foreign
influence, had at firft destroyedâthe histo
rian thus proceeds :
" He" (Aratus) " persuaded a number
of the small republics to enter into a league
for their own defence, which was called the
Acha:an league ; and notwithstanding that
the republics, taken singly, had very little
strength; they not only maintained their
independency, but footi became formidable
when united. This afTociation continued to
become daily more and more powerful; but
received a severe check from Cleomenes,
king of Sparta ; which obliged them to call
in Antigonus to their afliftance. This
prince overcame Cleomenes at the battle of
Sellafia, and afterwards madehimfelf master
of Sparta. Thus he became a more formi
dable enemy than the one he hid conquered;
and the recovery of the Grecian liberties
was incomplete.
<c Soon after this, the Greeks began to
feel the weight of a power more formidable
than any which they had yet experienced ;
namely, that of the Romans. That insidi
ous and HAUGHTY REPUBLif JirJl inter
meddled with the Grecian affairs, under pre
tence of setting them at liberty from the
oppreflion of Philip of Macedon. This, by
a proper .union among themselves, they
might have accomplished : but in this they
aÂ£ed as if they had been infatuated; re
ceiving, with the utmost joy, the decree of
the Roman consul, who declared them free j
without confideriug, that he who had thus
given them liberty, might take it away at
kls pleasure. Th\s lejfon, however, they were
soon taught, by the total reduction <f their eoun
try to a Roman paovince. Yet, this can
fc3rcelv be called a misfortune, when we
look back to their history, and cenfidet
their outrages upon one another : nor can we
sympathize with them for the less of that
liberty which they made life of to Jill
their country with Jlaughtcr and lloocljhed."

feeing them every day, I kold it my duty to deny
those Scandalous the publicity of
which may cause refuit* contrary to the spirit of
reconciliation which animates the two nations.
It is not by defamation, that the French Rcpub*
lie can he arretted in its vi&orioss career. ThÂ«
friends of peace, should not look for the aceom
plifhmentof their hopes, when it shall learn, that
the commiflioner?, who were fe-.it for the pnrpofe
of re-eftabliftiinjr harmony, and terminating the
differences, which have exited between the two
governments, are wholly occupied in inteiiCng
their fellow citizens against the chilfs of the Re
public.
1 myfelf well know, that it was the intention of
the French government, to demand a contribution
from the American government, as an indemnity
for the losses which the treaty of commerce with
England (maniteft violation of neutrality, on tho
part of the Unittd States) caused to France ; but
this contribution was far the state, and not for
the members of the government, and the men who
have thought yroper to make use of the pretext,
to cast a blame on theconduffc of thefirft magis
trates of a great nation, difdofe a secret design to
hurry their fellow citizens into a war, which
would be fatal to them, in order to gratify some
private resentments, or personal views. It is not
thus, if Iraiftake not, that pacificators ought to
conduft themselves.
What man poffefTed of the least degree of com
mon sense, after the accusations brought against
Messrs. W. X. Y. Z. by the plenipotentiaries of
the Uuited States could admit the insinuation di
re&ed against the members of the French govern
ment. fcThat can be the result ?Is it peace or
war ? Such an intrigue can have no other tendency
than tÂ» render a reconciliation more and more
difficult, and yet it was to conciliate two people,
formed to be friends, that the government of the
United States sent their commifliuners to France.
The commifiioners of the Federal government
confcfs that Meflrs. W. X. Y. Z. were not pof
fefied of any powers, and if we fupprfe for a
moment, that Meflrs. W. X, Y. Z. are not
mere imaginary beings, was it not the duty of
the commiffioÃcrg to have denounced thenp to
the Directory. Unofficial individuals were as
likely to have been the agents of the cabinet of
St. James's ab any other government, would it
not therefore have teen more wife, in filch cir
cumflanccs, before so baftily publifhiog this li
bel, to have come to an explanation that might
have cleared all up ?
When a nation fmcereljr desires peace, it does
not employ itfelf in conjuring up wrongs and
producing absurd charges against the power with
which it would wish to maintain it; but, when
it desires war, it employs every means which
can render it inevitable. 44 Would you" (fays
u Machiavel) " would you that a prince or a
" people lhould lose every desire to make peace
<f or to preserve it ? Here is an infalliable meth
" od, theefTe&sof which are sure and durable ;
" render them guilty of some crime or great in
" jury towardstfceenemy with whom you would
4< wilh to hinder their reconciliation. The fear
" of the penalty, which they would be confci
" ous of having incurred, would keep all ideas
" of peace from them."
Twenty powers were leagued to annihilate
France. France hasconquered them all, and ni
granting them peace, exafted from every one
either ccflions or contributions. The United
States have broken the treaty which connected
them with France ; the violation of this treaty,
which was the fruit of the blood of Frenchmen
shed for the eftablifhinent of American indepen
dence, and a c- nfiderable sum of money furnifh
ed to the Americans to support the war, has
been of incalculable d fadvantage to the repub
lic. And now therefore, the republic thinks it
has a right to demand fatibfailion The law of
nations and the example of past times, have
served as the bills of the coÂ»du<s\ of the French
government, and it is not now, wbeÂ« the direc
tory advances with a sure and firm step towards
immortality, when it is furrouaded with so
splendid a crown of glory, that ftiafts thrown
by feeble hands, can reach or injure it
I am so well acquainted with France as to be
able to allure you that the People of the United"
States have many friends there, even amoffg the
chifrfs of the government, and that proportions
sincerely made, would not have been reje&ed ;
but when iiegociators carry with them fuck a
spirit as di&ated the dispatches of tha plenipo
tentiaries of the United States, we ought not
to be furpriftd if they failed in their million.
My intention, in thus addrelTing you these re
flexions. has not been to juftify. the members of
the French government; the enemies who cre
ated their glori- us labors fufliciently eulogize
them. I only wifbed to offer a freth homage of
the refpedi aud gratitude due by all Frenchrrten
to them for the services they have never ceased
to render the country.

The Grand Jury for the diftridfc aforefaid,
seriously and sensibly feeling the ptefent
alarming situation of the United States,
conceive themselves impelled to declare thus
publicly and on this occasion, that they
fully approve of the energetic measures
pursued by the President, as also those by
him recommended to Congress to be adopt
ed, at this important and perilous pe'lod ;
especially when the people of the United
States are openly menaced with the direfnl
effe&s and calamities of a warâa war in
their opinion totally unexpected, beca'ufc
unprovoked and unjuftifiable on any rational
and consistent grounds.
They also on behalf of themselves (and*
they have reason to believe it to be the ge
neral and undisguised sentiments of the in
haViitants of this diftri&, from whence they
are drawn together) think it their duty to
fay, that although ihey deprecate the coq
feauences inevitably originating from war ;that although they conceive it to be the
universal wi!h and ardent desire of the peq.
pie of America to be at peace with all th?
world, and to remain perfectly neutral du
ring the present existing wars and diflentions
in EuropeâYet implicitly relying on the
wisdom, virtue, moderation and fortitude,
and having entire confi ! encÂ« in the fidelity,
patriotism and independent spirit of the

from Rocbfort to Fir filing On the other

crews "f pr,ivateers, who would not be em
ployed till the last moment ; the arresting ill
ihfl Englifil found at the different ports, and
l.iftiy, the orders given to all the officers to
join their corps, feeni to indicate that the
trial of a descent is not far distant. Per
haps it will commence by a partial one on
Jre! .id, a conjecture not impr obable, when
it it announced by good politicians, that an
ilifurreftion has begun, or is on the point
of breaking out in that country : It rs un
derll od to be an easy talk for the French
to make ttieinfelves nia/lers of that Island,
in which there are scarcely enough of British
troops, to reftrai . the numerous aflociations
of the partisans of independence ; and that it
would be impossible for England, threaten
ed at the fame time on her own territory,
to fend them any succours We are equal
ly fenlible how much the pofieffion of that
island, and the fright that such an event
would prodr.ee in England, would facilitate
the' fvibfcquent operations. We may, in
deed, fay, that it would insure the success
of the GRAND DESCENT.
To these prÂ®jcÂ£tsâto these hopesâwill
no doubt be objefted, the dificulty of con
quering the maiiiie-a-f England : these diffi
culties ire certainly too real, but after the
bold enterprifee executed in the course of the

rules of human prudence or forefight, who
wiilldare to determine, at this day, how far
it is possible to go ? In default of force,
are there not chances from constancy and
canning ?âHas not he who attacks a thou
sand advantages over him who defends him
felf ? Doesj not the ignorance of the part
to be firft attacked oblige the enemy to di
vide his force, and weaken himfelf at every
point, while the. former, ntafter of all his'
resources, studying to deceive his adversary,
ar d ready to profit by his firft mistake, mul
tiplies his means, and varies his plans with
every occasionâFor example, when the

BOSTON, May 21
By the arrival of Capt.Griffin, from Ali
caÂ»t, we are informed, that since the last
decree of the French relative to Britilh pro
duce and manufaftures ; the number of pri
vateers in the Mediterranean, in the Bay of
Biscay, and on the coasts of Spain and Por
tugal, has been very much increased ; from
the port of Malaga only, the number was
about 3J ; they capture and fend into port
almost every vcffel they meet with, and few,
very few escape condemnationâthe smallest
article of Britilh produce or manufa&uic,
found on board, or the most trifling error in
their papers, is with them a fufficient reason
to make good prize of veflel and cargo ; in
deed they are often condemned on pretexts
'he most frivolous, unjust and vexatious,
which could be imaginedâOne vessel was
condemned for having a few plates, part of
the cabin furniture, of English manufafture
âAnother for a few handkerchiefsâA
Swedish vessel from Carthagen a, with Bran
dy, bound to feme other port in Spain was
made prize of because by accident it was
mentioned in one of the bills of lading, that
part of the cargo was foraccountof a merch
ant living in Oporto ! they condemned her,
as exprefTed in the decree of condemnation
for having propertyon board belonging to a
port in Portugalâa Britijh Province ! !
The Danes have two or three frigates,
andas many brigsconftantly convoying their
vefTels up and down the Mediterranean, yet
more Danes and Swedes were sent into port
and fewer cleared than of any other flag ;
jull before capt. Griffin failed the Danifli
captains of the frigates received orders to
bring too every French privateer they might
meet with, andexamine her papers, to ascer
tain if Ihe had inftruftions to plunder ; if the
privateers do not instantly comply they are
to be fired ifito, and to be funk if they refill.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, Mat 25
Ext raft of a letter from a House of the fr/l in
formation, tinted Bordeaux, \ ub Mi rth, '9 y .
'â  As to the reagnanimitjr and generality
of th> rulers nf the great nation towards
private persons, while in the great chaos of
national Vevolution and the fupplica.t!on of
states a d empires, we fear the just lamen
tation of individuals will go unheard.â
What can a poor trader of Philadelphia,
represented by an humble consul, expect,
after feeing three extra rdinary envoys and
plenipotentiaries, five or lix months at the
gates of tht directorial palace, without ad
mifiioii to an audience, and 1 at a time when
the plenipotentiaries mult be daily warned
of additional (hacks and wounds of the long
injured and oppressed; commerce cf their na
tion ? It such a melancholy fail could give
any relief to the neceflitated individual who
is kept out of h s funds, it would be some
what less a/Biding to relate it. Paying
debts, barkening to diltrefs and justice, is
not the fafhion ot the timyÂ«. Levying con
tributions, giving law, and humiliating na
, tions, is the theme of the ,day ; and while
: proud Albi n and the Hanoverian race
tremble ; while Rome and the children of
Fabius are under chaltifement for support
ing the sceptre of oÂ£taviuj and the crimes
! of Nero, can the- well-born brethren of Mr.
I Jay expeft lo escape i
There is nothing new on the fubjeft of
our negociatisnsat Paris ; the envoys are still
there without ever having had an audience,
and it is generally thought their million will
,bc ineffcitu.il. I participai; in this opinion ;
I and nnlefs the current of French success, or
the politics of America undergoes fame
change, it will be impofiible to forefee the
ifue of the present discord between the two
nations."
ExtraS of a letter from his Excellency John
Sevier, governor of the State of Teunejfee to
a gentleman in this city ; dated
" Knoxuille, May .]tk, 1798.
" I have had, and still have confident hopes
that every prudent, and honorable measure have
been adopted far the purpose of bringing about
a reflsrationof karmony and friendfhip between
the United States and the French nation. Should
America be obliged to resort to arms as the last
alternative ; however difagreeablethe fame may
appear to be; be assured, Sir, tfith perfea con
fidence that I (hall with the good people of this
state lend every aid and assistance in our power
to pretefl and support the honor and dignity of
our country."
The above declaration does great honor to governor
Sevier. How great must be the disappointment and
chagrin of our enemies when they discover that union
is kthe standard under which the American dates
haÂ»c resolved to rally ; and thit one ieritiment per
vades the whole. Peace ii good j but independence
is better. 1
MR. FEN NO,
By giving the following extraft of a let
ter received from Pitt&iirgh, this day, a

CUSTOMER.
" J u< %e M is proceeding on from
county to county, making violent attacks
on all the friends of government. Whether
this is an electioneering scheme, or not, T
am not able to determineâperhaps Jte con
cludes it will point out his political charae
ter more clearly, and make his calling and
eleftion furc ; for he well knows that these
men would never have voted for hirri, so that
he loses no votes by quarrelling with them,
and may keep the other party more firmly
on his fide. At Weftmoreland he had a
violent quarrel with Mr, Johu Woods,where
it ran so high that it had like to have be
come general. At Walhington, this week,
he made an attack 011 Mr. Addifon (Dis
triCt Judge) in which we hear he abused
him in a mod violent manner ; and, though
not in the Court-house, threatened to have
him committed, said he was a Biitilh agent,
