USEFUL AGRICULTURAL HINT.
From a Liverpool paper.
The not permitting sheep to lay long upon the
ground, when firft put to turnips, but to move
them about at stated intervals in the day and ni/ht,
has been found to preveÃt that fatal disorder called
ti\e water in sheep, which arises from their gorging
tl.emfelves with turnips, and then temaining with
out exercise to carry off the beginning of the com
plaint. This method is fuccefsfully pra&ifed in
Northumberland, at the small expence of a little
trouble to the shepherd.
In the little work of Dr. Carmicbael Smith, con
taining experiments made with nitrous acid, to
check the infeflion of a fever on board the Union
Hospital-Ship ; it appears that the noxious effluvia,
generating fever, may be so entirely deftroyea,j by
the simple process of extricating it in the form of
vapourÂ» in an affeÂ£led apartment, as to render it
perfe&ly Yafe to the attendants, and others necef
fatily employed about'he perfonsof the sick. When
twenty or'thirty fever patients were carried daily to
the hospital, from on board the Ruffian (hips, by !
this simple means, not only the further esUenfion
of fever was checked, bat the generation of the 1
morbid matter was so much ftibdued, that only a J
Few cases of fevei occurred during the space of seve
ral months, and then on the vapour bring extrica
ted in the apartment once a day, instead of twice, f
which had been found neceTary during the height j
of tbedifeafe. , (

PROGRESS OF SCIENCE* \

We are informed that the semi annual examina- [
tion commenced at the Univirfity on Monday the 1
I ith of July, in the presence of his Excellency the J
Governor, President of the board, a confidcra'ole c
number of the Truftees,and the Committee of Vi- J
fitation ; thebufinefs was not finifhed until Friday n
the 15th, when the judgment of the Committee
refpefting the examination was publicly pronoun- f
ced in the presence of all the Students and the Fa- u
culty of the University 4 several clafles and feme of j
the Students received the marked approbation and r
applause of the board and Committee.
It was said with great truth by the French Con- f
vention " that as in every free Government, the f
law emanates from, the people, it is necessary that
the people should receive an education to enable
â¢ . the law, and the political part of this
education ItKiuntrDe pr ; nc i p l es 0 f
the Constitution under which they ] an
of education efiablifhed by the board of Truftefs 3
appears to be predicated upon this principle, and
designed to form ufeful and refpe&able members of
societyâcitizens capable of comprehending, im
proving and defending the principles-os our govern
ments ; citizens, who from the highest impulse, a J
just sense of their own au<j the general happiness, r
would be indnced to praflif? the duties of T6cfal v
morality. A deep and fixed conviflion that it is j
degrading to be tributary to other dates or coun- (
tries for ou'r literary and p-rblic chara&ers, a general
and strong desire to promote education and exalt &
improve our national charaÂ£ter, have given a tone
to the public sentiment, and bestowed a decree of 1
emulation upon individuals from which the mod r
happy tffeÂ£is may be expe&ed.âNear one hup- l
drcd of the youth of our country are now Students h
at this National InFiitution, and we are authorized si

" THE light of an Argand's lamp is to that of
â¢ a lamp of the common coi;.ftruftion, with a ribband
wick, as 187 to ico, and the quantity of ligh
with a given quantity of oil in these two lamps is 1
about 15 per cent. The light of the lamp when
compared with that of a wax candle three fourths
of an inch in diameter, was as j to 12. In the f
produSion of light, 100 paits of bees' wax are
fqual to IOT of tallow, 129 of olive oil, 12 Jof cr

twice at fajl when not fnuffed. It is not true that, ar
in the latter circumftanee, it givei less light ; but
a black opaque body, in the midst of the flame,
eclipses * grea't part of the light. Besides when
a candle is fnuffed, the inflamed tallow evaporates
from a much smaller fur face, than when it is not m

â  Extra 3of a letter.
The firm and dignified answer of the Canton of
Berne, to the insulting note of the French Direc
tory, has inftjfed a spirit of unanimity iÂ»
mind, and a spirit of vigor into every heart. There
is not a Swiss who does not swear to repel, and
flatter himfelf with the hope of revenging, agreea
bly to the invitation of the inhabitants of Bade,
and even of puni/hing, the aggression with, which
we are threatened by the French Republic.
It is impossible 10 form a just idea of all the mi
serable tricks which the Dire&Ory have played
upon the neighbouring dates. The ur.fortunate
republic of Geneva, which the French sffefted to
companionate, after the bloody scenes.to which
they had condemned her, is at this moment involv
ed in a dispute, which, whitnfical as it appears, oc
eafions her no inconsiderable alarm.
It appears that the French resident had beea

which we have been doomed to witness, See." tate the
The French resident, by way of punishing them from th
for having deferred the congratulations which he mand, a
exDetted, to so distant a period, .presented them taclimei
with the tri-colored flag, accompanied by a demand, head of
that a kind of civic feftival should be celebrated on appea're
the day of its reception. The Syndics, who were j reudy
perfe&ly aware of the objeA of this demand, and J and fid
were fenfib'.c that such an absurd feitival might be j his m?
produ&ive of trelh disasters to the Rcpublie, and j the me
affront the coalesced powers, refufed to comply loss wh
with it. The French resident then threatened to advanti
quit the place, and to write to the French Direc- right t(
târy on the fubjeft ; but the Syndics replied, that, them,
in that ease, they should fend two deputies to Paris rit, wh
and so the matter ended, the national flag being fidence
received incognito. rals ' 1
When the Syndics went out of office on the 3d troops
of April, and rendered an account of their con- their d
dqft, they were tailed upon to explain this bufi- ! by a
ness. " The ceremony of the reception of this j guard
flag," said they, "was by bo means a rpatter of'-time,
indifference; and bn an objedl of this nature, it and to
behoved the Council to be circumfpeft, on account iuffcr f
of the fmallnefs of out Republic. Besides, the the wh

The French resident took umbrage at this de- grÂ« c
claration ; he observed, that he could not avoid 'elf, a
fending it to the Ditedory, and that he could not that 1
answer for the cor.sequences. â¢Bht8 ht
He .seems the more anxious to terrify the people CxÂ° vei
of Geneva, because they no longer affect to con
ceal the deep reÂ»eÂ«"~Â»~ 'W <Â« faience for the which
(hare which the French induced them to take in all pi
the revolutionary schemes which have disgraced wrtho
their territory. Since thje depattnre of the troops, race,
by which they were surrounded, for Italy, the spi
rit of the Genevefe hasrecoveied i'sformer vigour, and [
and renewed its attachment to the antient laws of we ca
the countiy. A proof of tiiis change was Vxhi- 'his 1
bited, in a particular manner, at the ele&ion o! cÂ°mn
the new Syndics; for the chiefs of the revolution, the ti
who had the presumption to offer thcmfelves as Â«
candidates, were rejedted by an'iinmenfe majoiity ;
and the people chose four citizens, who, withouv

" "j' 1 ' is plain that France still is divided by patties. In t >
"n C Â£ overthrowing Robespierre, both Terrorists and Mo- ti
, Â° derates united ; the present government was then o:
formed chiefly of the modere Terroifts, who, at l e
its institution were the predominating party. They ?
were oppofedboth by the Moderates, and the most
' violent of the Terrorists, but they have reconciled c
the former by gradually adopting their system, and f,
have diminished the oppositions of thelattet, by
Ã¼blifh- v j n g employments to all who would accept of f<
them. The prudence and success with which the d
nfolent Directory has fteertd between these two patties ; Â»
I hopes the fl<ill it has shewn in gaining their friendfhip, or

It appears that Prince Charles has sent a reinforce

0 In Italy, as was before stated, Buonaparte croflcd the
d Mincio on the 17th ult. and forced the Auftrians to
o fall back, with the loft, as he aflerts, of 2000 men; g,.j
it but we know this assertion to be falfe, as Col. Graham,
, in his letter to Lord Grenville, represents the number c Â° n
' of Auftrians killed and wounded as not exceeding 300
men. The Colonel alio mentions a fuccefsful attack Sloop
made upon the French by a detachment of Austrian Jum
and Is eipolitan cavalry, which Buonaparte has thought j n W |,J
In proper to fupprets, as well as the capture of one of his â atcs .
m own Aids-de-Camp, and his lol's of men, which must
