For thi GA/.ETTE oj the UNITED STATES.
XTOTtyITHSTANDING there was con
i.N- fiderable oppofiliou to the adoption of
the conllitotion, the measures of the new go
vernment were nqt only peaceably acquiesced
in by fiie, people,, but tlie former enemies as
wel! as the si iend-, of the federal canfe joined
in rejoicing in its prosperous administration.
To revive trade and manufa<Ftures, to give a
fefurre&ioo to public credit and such energy
and liability to government as would be ade>-
quate to the jjeneral good of the people, weiy
the common fuhjects of couverfation. All
men, not in office, ai)d a'lmoft all in office,
whether federal lor antifederal, joined their
earned hopes and withes For this auspicious
era so important to our nation to be haftdned.
Accordingly, Congress made ill baste to ar
range the government, and to adopt the mea
sures which would have thefÂ» expected good
effetffs. The Treasury department was Ar
rangedânot a word (Sid against ft'. The pe
tition of the public creditors was p efented
to the firft Congress praying soT the full and
parmaneqt prpvilion of [heir certificrtes.â
The Secretary was required to prepare a plan
fur this purpose ; All America was informed
of this irt all the GazettesâAll America ejt
pedted a just and full provision for the debt
would be made at the next session of Congress.
The creditors exijlted iij the near profpeft of
having justice done them- The price of cer
tificates rofc very rapidly. The people feern
ed to rejoice that the rife would eithir pre
vent foreigners engrossing them, or make
them pay at anumifually high rate for what
they might purchase. During all this period
of buttle and expectation, the clamor agaiuft
m'onied influence and a funded debt was not
heard. So far as the public sense could be
colle&ed, it not only permitted but earnestly
demanded the adoption of measures to place
the publft credit on a firm and honorable ba
sis. Political integrity and honesty were
urged as the only ground on which public
faith could be fecyrelv retted. Not to be te
dious on a fubjeft which every man in Ame
rica knows to be truly stated as above, it may
be aliened, that the lenfe of the people at the
time as well as the experience of the anar
chy and dilgraceof a feeble confederation, re
quired such arrangements as the firft Congress
adopted. The repot t of the Secretary on
the means of providing for the public credit
was made to the firft Congress in their second
felfion. The candid pai tof our citizens may
be appealed CÂ», whether the firft impressions
weie not remarkably favorable to that per-

Afr cr an < 'inirlous iuipence., the attack was
iiKi.de on the pretence of extreme regard for

object and the pertain and known coufcanJnce
of t ! fafc fcWme of d'tferi mi nation was to (it
fe u thr whole provillon for the* d.-bt. Yet!
surely fhofe who urged the pagiufcnt* of fix
per jent. to the original holders, arid half to
the pu r ch;jfing holders by a funding fyftein,
'] cannpt pretend to condemn at this time of
any funding whatever It was their de
clared plan to f\ind. The majority Sifo"we're
for fundings though rrot on the idea of difcri
mi Dating. Who would have thought 1 jrbat
the party would A> fpon have clamoured a
gasbft a funded debt, a rrioricd inftnence,
aT- e-afnrv department, sm9 a dozen other
which if is rfow tf>e canting Habit ct
this party to ccnfure ? This, however, is'
the pretext, and faÂ£tioji is
tempting to oppose and embarrass all the mea

THeV pretend to refpe<sttlie sense of the peo
pleâYet Congress is called a buhch of knaves
for obeying it. The fund n'g of the debt was
forefeen and not a corner of the union in
which this expe&afion and the grounds of it
were not made known many months, before
the act pa (Ted. Not a man in the woods or

wheft the storm of party broke forth in Cou
Â£refs aj;ainft the Secretary's report, the hol
der* of certificates became alarmed. Many
fold out fupporfng that the debt would not be
funded at all, and that it would run down
and came to nothing, as the old continental
money did. The price funk, ants while the
fubjeft remained for fevn al months in total
uncertainty, it was a gayie of chance whether
the paper would be worth something or no
thing. The Southern certificate Holders fold
ouOt ivfaid ; -and-a-clamor is against
they, the holders fouthof the Potowmac, have
fullered loss by felling their paper.
Will ant candid Southern main fay, the
blame is justly chirgeafcle on that aÂ£f, or on
the nien who advocated its passage.. Thole
men uniformly and itienuoufly urged its pas
sage. T|ie dslay was not their fault, but
their misfortune. Thelofers arc to be pitied,
but they inuft acknowledge the friends of the
funding ai"t would have prevented their loss
if'they could. The causes and true history
of thÂ£ opporttion tk funding need not be sug
gestedâbut they very unlike the pre
texts which have firice been adopted to give a
color to their party. The hypocrily of ma
ny pretences to republican purity, fimpjicity
andjeSloufy, was not then bold enough to
raile its cry. Time that unfolds nla
ny truths to the deceived and abused mul
titude makes them forget the uses to which
i{ is to be applied. The few will
judge whether the party who are now moving
heaven and earth agsipft the government of
our country, and who'e ho;>es of filccefs are
Chiefly placed mi deceiving and enfla'ningâ
are not bojjnd to anl'wer lor all the lulfes and

quitted us to rfiake to the command

when you learn that we were there
treated as prisoners of war. Being

Arlon, Sepit. 3.
I am sensible how mach your
attention is engaged with my fitua
tiotiâl am well, this is all the fa
tt*fait ion I can at present give to
my friends.
" 1 -wrote to you since the epoch
âwhen the crimes of the ioih of
Augwft, the violence offered to all.
the constituted powers, the little
support 1 found in the bold step of
nrrefting the Commiflioners of the
Aflembly, and lastly, the inutility
of my death to the public cause,
were so many fuccelfive reasons for
determining'nie to quit France.
" Had the King been able to de
termine to quit Paris, as 1 propnfed
to him,.after having taken measures
for conducting him to Compeigne,
he would have avoided great dan
gers and great misfortunes. But it
is useless to recur to the past.
" I informed you how 1 resolved
to quit France, in which I could no
longer serve the cause of liberty,
and in which 1 could lieither-com
promise with guilt, nor bend under
the despotism of the Jacebins.
" 1 informed you also how I reach
ed-' Rocheforr, where there was a
poll of Aullriatis whom I and wiy
companions neither fought for nor
avoided. Yon must read in the pa
pers a declaration made by Us, as
well as a lift of the companions of
nyjourney: the manner in which
we announced ourselves, left us in
no doubt refpetling the right we
had to pass freely. We were how
ever conducted to Nivelle, and our
confinement became closer every
day. A part of the officers who had
accompanied me, have at length
been released â , the reft ought to
havp been so. Since Meanbaarg,
Alexander Lameth, Bureau de Puzy,
and myfelf, were put into a carri
age, under the escort of a major
and three officers of infautry, with
a detachment of hullars. At every
place where we arrived, two cemi
nels were polled at the door of our
apartment, two at the bottom of the
ttaircafe, and two at the street door,
besides those ported at th<? ftabks
and under the windows, so that we
were in every refpeft
prisoners of war, which was sMbfd",
but as stare prisoners, which is ex
plained by the conftiuitio-n of kiayo
nets. We shall arrive to-morrtfwat
Luxembourgâthis is all I know?.

against the Mountain, the whole re-'
public will become Mountainâand j
I, who have braved the daggers of
our little Cromwells, am ready to j
present my bread to the bayonets of!

mourier, that we are so reduced as
to choose between our tyrants?"
It would be difficult to paint the
indignation which seized on every
mind, at the reading of Dumourier's
trairerous letters in the Convention :
It was thus Casfar wrote when he
marched against Rome ; he also pre
tended to re-eftablilh peace, and de--
ftroy ty. anny ; he afFetfted net Â»o
aspire to the Supreme Authority.

nany of the members of which have, how
:ver, in my opinion, been led allray from

3umourier has removed every doubt on that
sead, by declaring in their favor. It is not
for me to decide whether Phillippe Egalite
might to be brought to trial, upon a charge
aftreafon; but this I know of him, that he
is a inan without moralsj without capacity,
and without honor. Whether or not he is

,Â° It is, however, no longer doubtful) that
the younger Egalite, who has followed Du

therefore demand that he may be declared no

that the Decree framed ajainft his worthy

Here violent murmurs afofe agp.inft the
Speaker; and it was demanded that he should
be called to order, and reprimanded. The
Aflembly now became very tumultuous, in
somuch that the Prafident put on his hat.
In the course of a few minutes, the tumult
was appeared, and Lecointre Ifuyraraux, ob
tained a hearing. He combated the propo
fitions.,of Marat which he found very impolitic,
*since they might induce the enemy to make
""reprifals, and cut off the four Commiifioners
jiTiprifoned at Toumay. He next insinuated,
that certain persons would perhaps be very
happy to fee the ci-devant pril'oners aflaflina
ted, to the end that their accbmplices might
not be come at.
Here Lecointre was interrupted by the
cries of the Mountain, several of the Mettl
bers <*n that fide observing, that none but the
friend's of the Capets, and Statesmen, could
entertain such a wifti.
At tbefe words, the t>imult redoubled.â

This motion gave rite to 4n agitation,
which conftant'y seeming to draw towards a
a conclusion, and as constantly renewed, was
of a very comidcable duration.
Dupe ret at length ascended the Tribunal.
tf The favor/' said Tie, u I have to ask of
the Convention and the Tribunes, is a calm

greatest criminals. It* I am culpable lam

kt For nineteen months, in the Legislative
AiTembly, did I combate a&ainft Despotism
and the Feni.'lans.
u Since I have held a Teat in this Conven
tion, I have unceaimgly striven again ft a
band of inÂ«fcreants, who have long fought
the dcftr-u&ion of the common weal.
" In vain for the last two days has an at
tempt been made to come at a knowledge of
the accomplices ps Dumourier, Lecointre has
for more than an hour endeavored to com
bat the propofit on of Marat, but has not been
able to obtain a hearing. In the interim, a
part of this Alfembly was excitecfby an emo
tion of indignation.âThis impulse I follow
ed ; and whilst I was stationed in the centre
of the Hall, I perceived a Mountaineer level
a pistol at my head. Seized by a natural emo
tion, and 'impelled, if I may so express my
felf, by a fury, I drew my sword. But I had
still another weaponâa pistol; and if I had
merely made a thruftatone of my colleagues,
I would inftanrly have blown out my braips."
The Aflembly at length put an end to this
farcical contest, by proceeding to a nominal
appeal on the nomination of commiflioners to
proceed to the Department of de l'Orrie.

United States.
COLUMBIA, (S. C.) May 21
On Monday last came on, in the Federal
Circuit Court, under the authority of the
United State*, in this town, beforejudge Pa
terfon and judge Bee, the important taufe of
William Higginfon, tiirviving co-partner of
Greenwood and Higginfon, lale merchants in
London, against William Greenwood, surviv
ing co-partner ofLegare and Greenwood, of
Charleston, and George Crofts and company of
Georgetown, merchants. It was by a bill on
the equity fide of th* Court. Mr-Read and
Mr. Pringle werj cawjcil for the complain
ants ; Mr. Edward Rutledge and General
Pinckney for the defendants.
It appeared, by the pleadings and the evi
dence, that in 1771, the defendants wrote to
the complainants to flipplv them with gpods,
&c. and agree to allow the usual commission
on the purchaCes, and five per tent, interest ;
that the accounts of the complainants fkou'd
be fettled and balanced every year, aiic 1 ! inter
est charged on the several invoices after a
certain periud from their refpe&ive datei;
and, if not paid at the end of each year, should
be added to the principal, and draw interest
alfd at five per cent.
This appeared to be according to the cus
tom of merchants engaged in that trade at
the fame time. The dealings between the
parties were continued for several years, and
the accounts of the complainants were ft2ted
according to the agreement, and sent over
â¢to the defendants until the 2iftof December,
177.7, which they acknowledged, to have re
ceived arid to be just.
Mr. William Greenwood, one of the de
fendants, and the only forviving co-partner
of both the companies in America, was put in
the confifcation lift in South-Carolina, and his.
property fequeflered for the use of the state
in 1784. âHe afterwards went to England,
and the complainant there applied to him to
acknowledge a dated account against Legare
ind Greenwood, which was made up to the
S-UfrDecemjeiM 7Sj,-t,o the amount of .about.
J4,0301. in which compound interest Was
charged for the whole time. He desired this
might be signed and acknowledged, for the
purpose of recovering it of the commiflioners
of confifcated property in South-Carolina,
which the defendant signed accordingly; but,
in his Snfwer to the bill he avers that he was
under arrest, and signed it without examina
tion. There was some evidence to this point.
Judge Bee did not think it amounted to a
legal purer* ; yet, as the account was signed
and acknowledged for the purpose and with
the views mentioned in the answer of the de
fendant-, it ought not to bind him ; and, par
ticularly, that it ought not to bind the execu
tors and repr.efentatives of deceased part
ners, bc,ing done long after their deaths, and
of course after the termination of the co
partnerfliip. The accounts against the firm
of Crofts and Co. amounting to about i 6,0001.
were never signed.
The cau r e was argued with great ability,
learnig and eloquence on both fides. 1
The complainants contended that they
were entitled, by virtue of the coritra<sV, and
the custom of the trade, to have the principal
and interest on their debt during the whoJe
time, and interest on the accumulation each
year. Many cases from the law were pro
duced in support of their claim, and the trea
ty of peace was particularly insisted on.
The defendant contended that no com
pound interest ought to'be allowed after the
mutual dealings of the parties had ceased ;
and that no interest ought to be paid during
the war. A? all communication was prohi
bited by the Sovere gn power of each nation,
it was unlawful,and indeed impossible to make
remittances : That the complainant being an
alien enemy, had no power to ftie, and had no
demand during the war : That his Claim was
forfeited by the laws of nations ; and that the
treaty of peace only restored to him the right,
lie had at the commencement of the war:
That the word debts in the treaty did not in*
elude interest of course ; and Hiat in treaties
where interest is intended to be included it
is always mentioned : [Several extracts from
treaties were read in proof of this.} That
the a<st of a sovereign of a state is the ast of
every individual who composes it; and that*
the complainant did, in fact, binder the de
fendant from making payment, and therefore
he ftiould not have interest, which is damages
for detaining the debt; besides, that in a great
national calamity, where the defendants could
receive no prpSis, no interest ought in equity
to accrue- This appeared to have been the
law in Irelaitd, and ought to be so here, &c.
The Judges delivered their separate opini
on* with great clearness and precision.
Judge Bee wat of opinion that the com
plainant fiionld recover interest, according to
contra#, till 1777, on both debts; that the
interest (hould then ceafctili November 1782,
1 the grnvifienal articles of
r '"-'*tr4jt"y of : peace, und should then cor.i
-, - lc - according to the contract tiil paid
I , J re -farCliim wai of opinion that the
cmtijMijjnd inteidft fliould be paid on both
debts during the time the parties had mutual
dealings, to wit, on the i 6,0001. till 1777, due
f rom George Crofts and Co. and then to drew
simple interest at 5 per cent, till paid, that
be'iig the time the dealings ceased ; and that
*'' e JifiOol draw compound interest till De
cember; 1783, the time the dealings with Le
gare and Greenwood ceased, from which time
it should draw simple interest at five per cent,
tit! paid. He was of opinion, that the treaty
of peace restored the complainants to all the
rights they would have had if no war had 1
been and.that the interest was a necefl'ary
con if\ u *" te tf>e debt, and was intended by
bVpeace.
The Court being divided, no final decree
was made.

From a perfoo who lately visited the wonder

not at the bottom, and formed a
conical or pyramidical appearance of some ex

cultivating with assiduity and success the arts

The frigap l'EnÂ»bufcÂ«<ae, pafftd the light
house on Friday evening, and fired fcveial gum
during the night, as figoals, it U fuppoC d tof
her boar. The next morning ihr was obfetved
at the distance of 5 leagues, (lauding Raft ; and
about one o'clock the day captured the
brig Catharine, Capt. Drifdale, of Halifax, from
Kingflon, Jjtnaica, bound to this port. The
Crcw,of the brig, except the on finding
the frigate overtake them, took to their boat,
and were taken up by a pilot-boat off Turtle
Gut. The prize was sent tn\o New-York.
The French fleet, for fotne time past exposed
at Martinique, had not arrived whrn Captain
Pat ton, of the brig Ranger, failed from thcnce,
18 days ago.
Capr. Smith, of the brig Aurora, in 19 days
from Port-au-Princr, informs, that on the 2sjfi
of May, ftie was chafed by the British privateer
. cutter Speedwell, Capt. Berry, of 8 gnus ard
60 men,.and boarded by an officer and 6 men off
Heneaga, who kept poffeflion of the v<,ffei tbouc
four hours, in search of French properly. They
informed Capt. Smith that ihey captured the
ffchaoafr? Ann, of and. thc,Rjegu-
Jator, of Baltimore, Cap'.. White, from Jeremie,
to this port, undtr pretence of having French
property and pafTcngeis on board. In one of
I these vcffcls was a considerable sum of money.
By the last accounts from Paris, it appears,
that'the moderate party in the National Conven
tion are the majorityâthe Mountain, not with
standing the applauses of the tribunes and the
galleries, have been in the minority iÂ» fevrral
motions made by the lleadv and confident
friends of liberty.
M. Bouchotte is appointed Minister of War,
in the room of Bournonville.
Grn. Dampierre has accepted the commaud
of the army.
There are various reports refpefting the
capture of several French places in the Weft
Indie l ; by the Englishâbut Marine and Indian
intelligence is as uncertain as that from any
quarter of the globeâTime is continually/ir
futing the mod of it.
COMMUNICATION.
In private life he that ratfeÂ» and lpreadÂ»
evil and groutidlefs report# of another is
deemed a oafe aflallin. In public affairs the
moll groundless fufpieions are v ami (lied over
with the pretence ofthe public goodâand are
imputed by the fabricators to be an extreme
zeal for the inttrefts of the peopleâlo honest
as to bepurblind. Happily for the peace of our
country,we have no state quacks or politicians
so careless or ignorant, as to make falle char
gesânor so bitter and so hasty, as to give
them to the public full of blunders and incon
sistencies thp.t carry their own ridicule along
with them ! Who will pretend that even or e
falfe accusation has been made agairft our
government either within the walls of Con
gress or among the body of the citizens ?
