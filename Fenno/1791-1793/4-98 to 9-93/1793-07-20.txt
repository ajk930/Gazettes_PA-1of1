NATIONAL CONVENTION,
May 1
A DEPUTATION from theFaux
bourg St. Antoiue, teftd the
plan wliicli they had adopted for
recruiting the army, and for mak
ing a proÂ«ifinn for those citizens
who had Sniffled. This plan was,
that every citizen who had more
than 2000 livres of annual income,
fhotikl carry the half of the excess
to the Treafiirer of the diftridl, if
he had no children ; and that those
who bad children flioolcl be flowed
to dedurt jcio livres from the ex
cess. The spokesman of the depu
tation said, " We come, Legislators,
to tell you severe truths : but we
come likewtfe to tell you how to
save country. Employing y-our
felves for a laltig time as you have,
with your own perfon&l interests
and palfions, and divided as yoti
have been, declare to U3 what you
have done 1 [Violent murmurs.]
" You havg promised every tiling,
and kept your word in nothing.
Our defenders have been left desti
tute of every neceflary ; and you
have engaged to regulate the price
of the necefiary articles of life, to
relieve the necefficonsâ but in no
one inltauce have you kept your
word.
" The people have madeevery f.i
crifice to Liberty ; and do you in
your turn forge: who you are, pro
prietors and farmers. Imitate the
pwpie in their facrifices, and efta
biifh a limitation of tlie price of
prowifjtins
" *Ve reqtielt of yon (hat a price
way be fixed tor provifio'ns, and that
you will adopt the iiieafure-i we have
proposed. These are the means we
think nrceflarV for Caving our coun
try. ff you do not adopt them, we,
who wish to save it, declare, that we
are in a state of insurrection ! Those
who unite with us in our demands,
are at your doors. We requett leave
to file off through tlie hall. We are
111 number 8000âbut ail unarmed."
The Convention was thrown into
* violent agitation by this har
rangu'e, and Mazuier moved, that
this petition should be printed and
ienc to the departments ; and that
all fiibfiitutes of the deputies
fliould be ordered to aflemble at
Tours or at Bruges.
PhilipeauX wifiied that the petiti
on might be rejected, and that the
pÂ£rfoil who read the address (haulii
be put under arrest.
The Preftdent now read a letter
from t lie inhabit ants of. the above
Kiuxhourg, Rating that as they had
learnt with grief that their petition
had brought on an unfortunate dif
cuflion, they had fentanew address,
signed, 'â¢ The people who wifli to de
fendâno;to destroy the Conven
tion."
The difc.uflion cant inncd for fame
time, and Onnton at length moved
the order of the day, as the petiti
oners had difilaimed any incivic
j and that the petitioners
ill oulci tie admited to tbe honors of
ibe fitting.

It was announced that the depart

with famine.
Barrere in the name of the Com

to a detail of the present li; nation

cording to his ftatetnent, was as
well every where as it possibly could
be ; and Francs in all her points ivai
impregnable.
This faithful portrait the mem
ber contrasted with another, which
represented the Powers united a
gainli France as in the rnoft poHibl<j
state of diftmion and difcÂ«rdance.
As all this was mighty consolatory,
Barrere's Report was crowned ft'iih
applauses.

A Deputy of Indre and Loire was
admitted to the bar.
I come, said he, to demand the
fpeedieftand molt eflfeiftual succours.
The National Convention appears
to have been abuled on the realiry
of our dangers. The Western De
partments are 110 less agitated than
ours, by the too common calamity
of treachery and coutuer-revoiutioii.
A war more difaftrnus that) that we
wage against Francis or Frederick
William dfefolates and threatens to
annihilntethe Republic. The coun
ter-revolutionary traitors prefeut
themfelvea in several points at once,
in columns of from ten to twelve
fhonfand wen. I demand of yet:,
Legiiiiiors, by what fatality it is
the Executive Council has left us
two jnonths without arms and with-
out men '
" By what fatality have the bat
talions ordered to us been counter
manded ? If the end of these schemes
have been tofavor the insurgents.to
open their way to Paris, it is fulfill
ed. The territory of Indre and
Loire is fubjecfted by the traitors ;
the city of Chinon is now, perhaps,
in their hands, and they have seized
on DietTuire, Tours, and Loudun ;
the latter of which places, alter
throwing down the Tree of Liberty,
did not scruple voluntary to open

" On the receipt of tliis intelli
gence, Legillators, the .Adiiviniltra
ors resolved to repair to Chinon,
.vhere all the citizens were mufter

inoned to follow. This rampart of
our fafety is, however, far from im
pregnable : and unless you instant
ly fend us men, arms, and ammuni
tion, we cannot answer for any the
fmallell chance of the public fafety.
" I therefore demand, in the
name of the department, that the
Executive Council instantly dispatch
for C hinon and Tours,all the troops
at its disposal ; that to expedite
these succours, the battalions which
lhall be thus collected be embarked
on the Loire, as soon as they can
reach the banks of that river ; and
that all the disposable final) arms,as
well as cannon, (lores, and ammu
nition of every description, follow
them. Six hundred thousand livres,
at least, ought besides to be sent to
the Department."
Bentabole demanded that alarm

A letrer from Talien, commission
er in the departmetlis of lndre et
Loire, and Loire et Cher, dated
Tours, May ] oâdating lhai falfe
and alarming news wasdaily (plead
ing by the enemies of t he Republic,
reCpecfting the fuccefles of ihe infur
geiHs; and that an a
gent of Dumooricr, had, after the
example of his patron, betrayed the
iriterells ov his country, by opposing
little refinance, though he had scoo
men under his command,, to the
forces of the rebels. It was even
(aid, that he had induced his foldi
eis to fly before them. Talien ad
dedâthat Loudun was evacuated ;
that the enemy would perhaps be in
pofleflion bÂ£ it that day, and that
Here were only very tew troops to
copofe them. It was however hop
ed that a small army could be col
levied until the new battalions, so
long promised, should arrive.
Letterfrom Citizen i)evauliverd, to
Citizen Talien, dated Chinon,
May 8.
" We have heard the uoife of
cannon all this morning, which
makes us presume that Ligoniei' is
engaged. I hope that he will be
more courageous and less a traitor
than Qoetineau, the ci-devant adju
tant ol fiumourier, who, infteadjnf
fighting as he promiled before me,
Ail-rendered with goco nun ail arm
ed, whom he had in ihc tow n of
Thoiiars. Tlie brave Marfeillele
â¢.'-â rug merit praiseâthey tore down
the white flag which had been hoifl:-
ed j combatted like true republi
cans, and, though reduced ailength
to the number of fix, flill fought
till every man of ihem was cut ro
pieces. They formed themselves
into a square, and when their car
tridges failed, ihey fell furiotifly on
the infurgems with their fixed bay
onets. Had all the red of the troops
at Thouars followed their example,
it would have been (till free."
The Convention, after bearing a
report from the committee of pub
lic fafety, decreed that of the 2r ,000
men, making part of the levy of
300,000 decreed on (he 24'h of Fe
bruary, and now aH'einbied at Gre
noble, 8 battalions ihould be imme
diaiely organized to inarch againfc
the insurgents.
A letter was read from 3oi(T'et and
Moyre Bayle, Commidioners of the
Convention in the Department of
the Bouches-du Rhoine They an
nounce that all the nieafures which
they had ordered at Ma.rfeilles to
fecpi't the public welfare, had been
carried into execution with much
tranquility, when in :in inltant the
scene had changedâthat the fedti
011s of Marseilles, which had con
stantly kept themselves within the
fii ft bounds of their duty, had cxer
cifed, and were now exercising pow
er without limits ; that they bad
created a popular tribunal, and had
anthorifed it to purfne all offences ;
that the constituted authorities were
by this means etnbarrafled in their
proceedings. One of the fecftions
deliberatt i upon lending a deputa
tion to the commirtioners j they
came to them in the night, made
them get out of bed, and forced
them to break open a bureau, of
which their secretary had the key.
They did this to examine their cor
respondence, They ordered them
to depart in twenty-four hours, un
der pain of being arretted. On
their arrival at Avignon, they had
nearly been mallacied.
The Commiflioners made a dccree,

Nortkcrir/frity, dated Otthies,
May Q.
41 1 herewith transmit you a report of the af
fair of yeflerdav, which has been just now sent
to me by General Lamoliere. I can warrant
the truth of it, as I never quitted him a moment
fihee our departure from Liilc, and as I have
fees every thing he did, and all tlie jprivate ac
counts which he received. What he fays re
fpe&ing the firmnefs of the soldiers of the Re
public is ftri&ly agreeable to truth.
" In an expedition in which all the wants of
the troops could not be supplied at the mom nt
notwithflanding the attention of the General
and the Adminiilrators, our bravs defenders te
ftifitid no tineafinefs, except on account of the
enemy not being near enough that they might
engage them. In the concise account of the
General, I find that he has forgot to mention,
that at ten yesterday evening, as we were retir
ing to headquarters, we oblerved the Abbey of
Vigogne in flames. It was set Â»n fire by our
howitzers, and as the flames raged violently, I
an>induced to think that rhc of the
enemy must be consumed ; and I have no doubt
that we {hall be mailers of them to-day.
"P. S. Prisoners taken at Vigogne arccon
tinually arriving. There area great many Eng
lish amongfl them. In the lafl convoy there
were 14 of Englifli, all wounded."
Report of General LamorUere.
" The affair of the Bth has been mod glori
ous for the arms of the republic, and proves in
the bell manner the dignity of the cause lor
which we are fighting. At fevcVi in the morn
ing, for such were the orders of Gen.Dampierre
the commander in chief, the different corps of
which my small army is composed, attacked
the advanced polls of the enemy. The firingj
was commenced by the division under the com
mand of Gen. Defpourches, who was charged
to dislodge the enemy from the Abbey of Vi
gogne, and from the differerif entrenchments
which they had in the wood of St. Amand. The
Gen. and our brave brethren in arms presented
themselves with unexampled courage and intre
pidity. They overcame incredible obstacles, as
1 at every Hep they found entrenchments, from
which they drove the enemy, who were every
where far superior in number, notwithstanding
batteries of 17 p unders which they continually
employed againlt us.
" Defpourches had taken post on the platform
of the Abbey of Vigogne, where he entrenched
himfelf, and kept up a brilk fire from a quarter
past 7 in the morning until 9 in the evening, (
fuccefsfully sent him a supply of provisions and
ammunition, which he in vain expedted from
Valenciennes. This General Officer used all his
efforts to have his right wing covered by the
left flank of Gen. Hedonville, who attacked
Rhemes at the fame time, but he could never
succeed, except in regard to the few chasseurs.
It appears that the enemy lott a great number
of men, we had also some brave foldieib killed.
" This division lay on their arms all night, in
the wood of St. Amand, retaining their porti
on, and will this morning continue their at
tack, which cannot be made v/ith advantage un
less they can unite on the right wing with
divisions ordered to dislodge the enemy from the
wood of Rhemes.
" At tlie moment when Defpourches attacked
with my advanced guard, I marched against the
enemy encamped near St. Amand in two differ*
ent points.
" They made a more feeble defence than they
did the preceding evening, and endeavoured to
draw me neÂ»r the town or the causeway ; but
having determined not to take poff-ffiofi of it
till they should be driven from Rhemes and Vi
gogne, I occupied them in different point* and
ar different times, to render my diverlion more
ufeful.
" I dire&ed several attacks on my left, both
against Leccllea and against a mill where the
enemy were potted, andfioxn which they were

The attack was so unexpected, that thole who
were not at fir it killed, or made prisoners, en-

clofrly, that the Sixon troops, charged with the

Extralofa Letter from Cou'inJSir lama \furraj
Hait. Adjutant General to the forces unit' the

â *33-
In confeouence of the movement* of lk)*e*
enemy, wmc.i 1 :>ve re.tfon ti> expe<st an at-!
tack uNn the Austrian and PruiEan putts, liis-
Roval Hir.hncl's determined .10 march jn the
mo ning of the Bth to their fupporr. lie ar
rived about fix o'clock at the crjmp of Maul
de with the brigade of Gnartfs, and a battalion
of the loth lesiniunt ot Hanoverian infantry.
The Prufiian General was by this mean 1 ! ena
bled to reinforce himfelf, at St* Amand and
the adjoining wond, with the troops which had
occupied that important position.
The attack commenced about 7 o'clock.
It was directed agitnft the posts occupied by
Scheldt to the Abbayc da Vigogne, and the
Pruliian corps which defends the wood in the
front of the high road, leadinglroui that pUc'
to ?t. Am tnd.
To these paints were directed the whole
efforts of the French army, which had been
previously reinforced by all they could bring
together from every quarter. General Kno
bteldorif having been under the neccifity of
fending a confutable part of the troops to
lupport the Auftrians at the Abbaye de Vi
gogne, his Royal Highness about 5 o'clock,
lett two battalions in the camp ai Manioc,
and marched with the Coldftream, the flank
battalion, and that of the third regiment, to
his support.
When the battalion of the Coldftream,
which was upon the left, arrived, the enemy
had nearly reached the road ; they abeady
commanded it to a great degree, by the fire ;
the guns attached to the battalion were pla
ced up(ii) it, and by a well directed and well
supported fire, kept the battery which was
opposed to them in check, and did considera
ble execution.
The battalion advanced into the wood, at
tacked and drove the enemy before them :
in going,for ward they, became unfortunately
exposed to the fire of a battery, from which
they filtered severely. They fell back to
their position at the edge of the wood, which
they maintained for the reft of the day, not
withstanding a heavy cannonade ; the enemy
made no attempt to approach them. Nothing
can exceed the spirit awd bravery displayed by
the men and officers of the battalion upon
this occaiion ; nor is less praise due to the
alacrity and intrepidity with which the
other battalions advanced into adtion.
They took different positions in the wood,
where they were at times exposed to a severe
cannonade, from which, however, tiiey re
ceived little injury, the direction of tile fire
being in general above theni. There were
seen this morning between forty and fifty of
the French lying dead upon tiie spot upon
which the lire of the Coldftream and of its
guns hats been directed. Major General
Lake commanded the battalions which went
into action ; and his Royal Highness declar
ed he was much indebted to him for his ex
ertions.
The importance of the service rendered
by his Majesty's troops upon this day has
been acknowledged in the (IrOngeft and mo(t
most explicit teifris by the Generals of the
different armies; and if by their trmely co
operatiwn the enemy were prevented from
advancing upon the high road, it cannot be
.doubted that they contributed, in a' vefy
degree, to secure the fortune of the day.
At the Abbaye de Vigogne and the village
ofÃaimesthe a&ion continued with'a.lmoft
equal and unremitting violence, tils 8 o'clock
in the evening : General Clairfayt was every
where fuccefsful in maintaining his ground ;
the enemy, however, though balHÂ«l and de
feated in their purport?, remained in the woods
within a very small distance of his
During the action they cannonaded the Prus
sian camp near St. Amand. lam not exattly
informed what mealures they took in order
to keep the Prince of Cobourg in check, but
it appears that nothing of moment patted in
that quarter.
Upon the following day, t!ic grh, there ( was
but little firing, and it was not known, what
might be the intention of the enemy. His
Royal High'nefs thought it therefore proper
to let thejtroops remain till the evening at
St. Amand and Maufde. Every thing being

butchered, and floating in their blood, which
was still warm ! Then it was that, listening

Extrafl from a publication in a Baltimore paler,
41 T TCTHILST thousands and tens of thou-
VV fends of our fellow creatures are
exterminating one another from the face of
the earth, we repose in the lap of peace and
. liberty, war, the scourge of mankind, being
at a great di ft a nee from us.âWe all rejoice in
ttut ftt icfc neutrality, which has been wifely
determined upon, and all unite in hope, that
it inay not ba interrupted. There are how
ever some amongst Als, who do not scruple to
assert, that the admiflion.of French privateers
with their prizes, and liberty <*f laie, in our
ports, will ultimately involve tbÂ»s country in
a dispute with England. I know not whe
ther fueh remarks flow from a spirit irritated
at feeing English prizes only carried in ; or
from a diabolical wish of once more feeing
tbe banners, of. de r potrfra waning our happy
mores ; or, perhaps, flowing from a heart
fearful Of our peace and harmony being in
danger of interruptionâGod, who kuotvs the
heart, only knows from what motives such
fentimenti are propagated !âSure I am that
they are impolitic and indecent.âThe right
of admitting privateers and their prizes into
the ports of neutral nations, has never been
queftionecl ! Neutral ports are a fan&uary
{or all the powers at war ; the produce and
manufactures of other nations are vended
therein and by reason of their neutrality, they
soon become rich and prosperous ! Previous
to the late war, Oftend was an inconsiderable
port, and the most filthy in Europe ; having
the benefit of neutrality, it soon rose into
consequenceââprivateers with the prizes
flocked to itâsales were freely permittedâ
merchandise, to a vast amount, were carried
thither from all nationsâthe riches of the
E*aft and Weft flowed into Oftend, and at
length the emperor Joleph, sensible of the vast
advantages it enjoyed from its state of neu
trality, enlarged and beautified the harbor,
removed many of the natural obftru&ions
that rendered the entrance dangerous, andjt
now Alines as one of the firft commercial ci
ties in Europe. Lisbon was open for the re
ception of the velfels and prizes of -the pow
ers at war (Americans I think only excepted,
whose independence Portugal had not ac
knowledger!) and I believe in no cafe was
sale? prevented. "We all know the advanta
ges Euftatia ei joyed, by reason of the neu
trality of Holland, and would have continued
to enjoy, if the court of Great-Britain had
not reason 10 think a feciet treaty was en
tered into between Holland and this country,
and in consequence declared war ! And was
not the good effects of their neutral condi
tion felt by all theDanifh Weft-India lfl&nds?
âWhy therefore bellow against the govern
ment of this country, and express fear and
appiehenfions of war being the consequence
of actions which are the practice of neutral
independent nations (existing treaties altoge
ther out of the qneftion).âSuch gentlemen
would do wellto refrain from such observa
tions, which can do no good, but much hartn,
til! they fee the conduct of government to
Brit;fb ci uizers, with French prizes, if arty
ihouid arrive among us. M

Yesterday arrived here the ship John, Capt.

Dutch paper of the i6th May brought by this
vessel contains an acconnt said to have been
received at the Hague byexprefs from Prince
Saxe Cobourg's armyâof a battle fought on
the nth May, between the French and the
combined armyâ-in which the French were
defeated with the loss of nine thoufaud men
killed, wounded and taken, and eighty-four
pieces of cannon ; the account adds, that the
commander in chief of the French was killed.
âThis is probably a repetition oj the ajjair of the
%th with additions.
The account 1 ? in general received by this
veflel are as vague and indefinite as those
through other mediums.
ExtraÂ£l of a letter from a rcfpeflable Merchant in
Baltimore, to hi ffriend in this city % dated the 16th
in /lant.
" A veflel from Cork in 32 days, brings an
account of the defeat of the combined armies
at Conde, and of an immense (laughter among
them.
" The French armies have been so fuc
cefsful, that the people throughout England
and Ireland, are feekingfor peace, and it was
the prevailing opinion it would soon take
place, highly in favor and much to the honor
of tbe French nation."
Further accounts by the late European arri
vals inform, th-t the attack pr fturrning of Meuiz
or Mayence, was to be tfiretted by Gen. Tuipin,
and that the bombardment of that city was be
gun. Gen. Ctiftine's army, confiding of 40000
men, was strongly intrenched within \he lines of
WeiflTemburg behind the Lamerâ t)iis army is
said to be coiripofed ot men either too young or
too old, the confcquence of forced recruiting.

The Spanifn invasion, Cambon said, had turned
out to be nothing of consequence, their forces
consisted only of a few vagabonds who came
for the fake of plunderâand that they were
beaten back. [An account published in this city
has Jlatedthe Spanijh forces dejlined to invade France
at 120,000.] A letter from Gen. Biron, at
Nice, of 22ci April, gives an account of some
advantages gained by the French uflder his com
mand over the Sardinians; 100 of the latter
were killed, and 20 wounded ; of the French
only 5 killed and 10 wounded.âThe militia of

of the public credit.
The Court ot Lisbon has ordered a cruize in
the Streights of Gibraltar against the French,
confifttng of a ship of the line, lout frigates,and
several vcfTels of less size.
The late action neai Conde was, by all ac
counts, very bloody. The French fought lor
the purpose only of covering some relief which
they wiflied to throw into Conde, and in this
tis said they partly luccceded.
The Dutch are fitting out a fl-et of 10 ships of
the line and 10 frigates, and 3,500,000 florins
have already betn issued out foi that purpose.
An English frigate had taken a French East-
Indiaman from Pondicherry to France, valued
at 130,0001. but at this rich prize was fleering

Letter from the Minifler of the frenek Republic,
to the Sea clary oj the United States of America.
Philadelphia, Feb. 6, 1793.
Second year of the Republic.
" In Conformity to the orders I have jest
received, I am eager to notify to the Govern
ment of the United State*, in the name of
the Provifionary Executive Council charged
with the Administration of our Government
that the French Nation has conflituted her
felf a Republic.
" T'his uotirication would have been ac
companied with fteffi Credential-;, if the bafit
which ought to be established on this head had
been finally regulated, and if the Kxecutive
Council had not chosen rather to manifeft- as
soon as pofi'i'e, the resolutions taken bv the
whole nation, of declaring tUe abolition of
Royalty, and the creation of a Republic in
France. Independent of the inte'eft which
this great ds terininatian of a nation, that has
given her concurrence to the defence cf h.
berty, and establishment of independence,
ought to inspire here, it will doubtless also be
considered by the United States, ar. a new
pledge of the close friendfliip which subsists
between the two nations. In this persuasion,
the Executive Coonfel of the French R.epub
lic hp.s charged me to alfuie vour Govern

of your Government, that the French nation

Prelident receives with great fatijfa&ion this
attention of the Executive Council, and the
desire they have-manifefted of making known
to us the resolution entered into by the Na
tional Convention, even before a definitive
regulation of their new eftablilbment couid
take place Be allured. Sir, that the Govern
ment and the Citizens of the United State!
view v.'ith the mod fiecere pleasure, every
advance of your Nation towards its happ-nefs,
an o'jjefte(Teiitial|y ronnefted with its liberty,
and they consider the union of principles and
pursuits between our two countries as a link
which binds still closer their interests and af
fections.
We earneftlv wilh on our part, that these
out mutual dil'politions may be improved to
mutual good, by establishing our commeicial
inrerconrfe on principles as friendly to natu

I am, with sincere efte -m and refpeft.
