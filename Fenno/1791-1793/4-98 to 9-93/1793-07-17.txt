IjCtllCifllHD,]
â¢ I 'HE firft public magiflrates, known among
A rude nations, are their military leaders.
Their firft public laws iremilituryoriers- Their
firft ideas of regular government are thole of
military JifcifJirir. Their firft ideas of national
character, and natiortal'nrtion, arise from na
tional exigencies that re&r to war or hunt
ing. The idea# of siting in concert, the ties
of public unitm, are firft fell; and .recognized
by them during the operations of war, or the
kindred employments of the chafe. Their
firft sensibility to public opiniort and honor, is
iinpreffed by such scenesâ-and, in liich scenes
they acquire their fii ft ideas of public cha
racter, of order, government, fuborcftiiation,
regularity. Survey the biftory of theunivrie !
Is there a (ing'e nation that ever became ci
vilized before they were habituated to a f\Jlem
of military order t The feudal system, which is
the basis of European government, Â»>d of
which strong refemblauces have obtained in
Asia, was clearly of a military nature ; al
though the pay of the troops, instead of being
pecuniary, was territorial : Fob- it was a
fundamental principle of the feudal tenure,
that the Stipendiary property allowed the feu
datory, (hould be enjoyed by him, in consi
deration of his conforming to the orders of
his fuperlor officer and performing the fervi
ccs commanded by his military chief, or head
warrior.
The red people who border on the United
Stare-., have not however, been as yet habitu
fted to a regular fy/lem of military fubordi.
to; ion.âAlthough in the space of the lalt for
tjr, or even twenty years, they appear to have
made a perceptible advance towards such a
fyfrern. Among other confident tion-s, the de
gree of regularity with which they planned
Â«nd executed their operations in 1791, ar
jgass, that they are advancing from the state
of savages to that of barbarians ; and that,
Â»5 fitch, the Indians are 0 more formidable
enemy than tl:*y were bef-re the American
revolution
Â«d of property, union, order, and
resource, -is to maintain of themselves a re
gular (vlfeirt of military Subordination. Yet,
fike barbarians, the red people are diftihguifll
ed by Com- of tho e strong traits of character
vhich marked the eaiflier stages of the feudal
pulicvâSuch are the aversion to labor; con
tempt of the mechanical and commercial arts
âthe pi oneness to plunde l âand the passion
ilir war and warlike exercises and sports.
These traits ftrongfv mark the character of
the Indian warrior. They present his ruling
pafllon. And by this paffioji, it is projected to
feizs himâand r cJt him to his own interest,
to tlie tru? interest of his tribe, and to the
irltereft df riie United States.
Govlrt his pafllon far war be so converted
at tti be made the inftrmnent of' peace and
fiv-ilizatkr , the impottwlt point would be
gained, lirftead therefor# of giving prefenti
tÂ» an Indian warrior, let hi in be allowed pay !
inlte'ad of being urgett to labour, let him
Inow that he may omit it ! Let him alio be
induced in his contempt of tire median cal
Â»md commercial arts, unfil time fh â  H have
ejirre&ed his prejudices S let a main incen
tive to plunder be tiken away, by allowing
&;n a regular arid cumtfrrtatlle lublifteiue !
And-inftead of telling him to abandon the
ihi aiter of sÂ» warrior, arid thus at once to
â¢radiejtir the strongest passion of his sous, tfW
bim that ho fttall be a more formidable war
rior tlian can bÂ» found in any of 'he t'ibes
that are at variance with his own ! tell him
tint lie fliall be a re ular warrior ! tell him
to be a good soldier !
The |>rÂ«>je& thrrÂ«fore tvKWrfs suggested is
in substance, That the United States ffmuld
engage in fervire and maintain a body of red
troop*, allowing t' em Arch pay and emolu
ments as rtiifitary principles may require.â
That a proper port on of their officers, el
pec i ally of the higher grades, fliould be Ame
rican citizens, as affording afecurity for tlieir
conforming to the authority of the Union:â
That these troops ftiouid not exceed a cer
tain proportion, fay one half, of the whole
military eftablifhriient of United States,
f<> that the reft of the forces, being- white
froops, miftht with other c?ues, .completely
fee ire the obedience of the Indians ! Ar.d al
though it might at si ft be somewhat difficult
to m.ike them conform to the n inutix of
â¢wJkafy arrangement, yet it is imagined,
that they might he gradua'ly hnb'tnatrd to a
difciplinc which should be liberal, yet eventu
ally exact, nervotn, fo!id.
Could this measure be earned into full ef
fect, it might undoubtedly be attended with
important eotifequences.
The red troops might serve in lfeu of the
fame number of white men : and it? is pre
fumed,that t<)Â« expence of maintaining; them
need not ntnch exceed, if even equal* the ex-
P- ce of maintaining a like number on ilÂ»e

co-operation with the more regular force of
the white troops, might alio be of material
advantage. And the suggested project, if
completely executed would operate at least,
in a duplicate ratio againlt Indian hostilities :
It would not only fjarnifh men for the ser
vice, without taking the citizens from the
productive occupations of peace; but it would
alio prevent the tribes to which the red iroops
belonged, from making war againfi the inion
âsince their warriors would be in the United
States service. Artd further, this meifure
would tend to liecure a compliance with irea
tieson the part of" the Indians; would i,\<ro
diiC2 jniotig them habits of fubordmatioi and
gbvernmentâand would thus facilitate the
advancement of regular industry, the ad
vancement of the agricultural, mecharical
and commeicial arts ; hereby accelerating
ilieprogrefs of civilization, and moral ini
provement.
The peace of a tribe or nation, being fe.
cured bv means of military regularity, the
Indians might be advised to aflomble andde
liberate on their own affair*. Different towns
might be pirftiadfd to consult together for
their common interest, and to cxttrd their
views beyond such objeAs as principally occu
py their attention ir> the councils already
known among the Indian;. They might be
gradually taught to elect persons who (hould
reprelent them in fncli confnltations. And
they might be told, that the young men might
not to determine on any measure that con
cerned the nation without the concurrence of
the old men. Thus they might eventually
be habituated to the art of legiflntion ; and to
the institution of a public council, consisting
of Reprefenrarives poifeflirg the ardour of
youth, and of Senators diltinguifhed by ma
turer age and capacity.
The extensive views of civilized society
now begin to open upon the mind. Ard we
might'look forward to the mode of adminis
tering justice ; the eventual establishment of
a regular fyftfcm of civil government; and
the introduction of education ard science
the prevalence of government, lasvs, liberty,
industry and the arts of peace among the In
dians 1
civilizing and humanizing the ruder part of
mankind, mi "ht be ascertained with a preci
cion, and carried to a degree of perfection, of
which hfjlory can Jvrvi/h no example. For it is
ftiggefted, that the United States should lay
the basis of a Jyjtem for civi/izhig the whole con
tinent aj America. Simple in principle, seizing
the rude warrior by his ruling paflion, this
proj.'ft propoies to conduCt him bv the inftru
inentality of this pafllon from a state of fero
city, to a flare of liberal government, moral
order, industry, humanity, peace.
To tb>s project, there may, I know, be op
posed one general obje&ion which will per
haps comprehend the mass of objections that
might be urged in the detail! It may be ob
jected, that the project is new, bold, exten
live. But was there ever any improvement
that was not new ? Is cowardice, ill the most
favorable view,any thing but a negative qua
lity, th it does no good, and prevents improve
ment ? And.at the word is not coward'ee in
literature, science or politics, as well as in
war, a rascally quality, that is tatal to the ac
c'omfiTimnient of any thingdifficu.lt and ulefuli
Has rot the idea of reforming criminal; and
making them nfeful members of society been
dec'ied by cowardice, as being the mad pro
ject of visionaries, until the American mag
nanimity dar;d to prove its propriety by car
rying it into rffeÂ«st > And is not the conltitu
tion of the United States one of thi newest,
boldest, fublimeft projeifts ever executed by
mar ? And has any man of sense ever conft
dered it as a dofeft in some of the most emi
nent chara&ers in America, that they were
diftinguifted by daring ai d enlarged views, as
well as by accurate maturity of judgment ?
If a measure be in principle u(efui,and
friendly to humanity, its novelty, boldness,
and extent, are considerations that ftiouid re
commend it to the true American. And it
is worthy the American glory, by theireXam
ple, to teach mankind, rot only the art ot
faming republican goyernniei ts and thus
ftrving liberal order among themselves, bpt
also the art of civilizing and humanizing C'.-e

mid your immaculate coadjutors, ate hraying
from morning till night, in order to involve
this naj*py country in all the horrors infepar able

You act. â¢â¢ why our executive was so paflive
wh<;n the brig Little Sarah was arming heie, aJ

Republican governments arc not new in the

iOw happens it that there was no combination

ft cafy to have crufht d u< to atoms ? If you arc
at a lof.s for t"he true cause*, I will tell yon. It
Whs because there was nothing unreasonable in
operating from a country, who hid denned us a

Your address to the militia of Philadelphia, is
an insult to their understandings. I have the
pleasure of being acquainted with a number of
that refpe&able body of citizens, and can there
fore aflufe you, that thev know well how to
discriminate between what is ihe cause of
France, and what is the caws e of a lev/ (rlfith
individuals, who, in open violation of tlie laws
of the United States, are embarked in the djf.
graceful business of fitting out privateers, which
, --Â«os
rled, can
pirates. The virtuous yeomanry 6r l ffmÂ¥WA
are equally proof to your seditious doflrines.
If this meritorious class of citizens submitted
with patience to the evils resulting from the late
lengthy but just war, it doe# not follow thai they
are prepared in the present instance to join in
provoking a rupture with all the maritime pow
ers in Europe, in order to fell their wheat to
Ju*a -and his affocialcs, at eighteen pence per
buihel, and take any kind Â»f plunder in pay.

Y6U (ell us Â»rt)otig otheT tferngs, that the brig

There is much reÂ»fon to doubt the truth of this
amnion, becanfe it is well known that fhc was
purchafrd at auction by a private pcrfouâand
even adtfituing Â«he fa& as ftaiefi, yet it docs not

any right from treaties to arm veflels iÂ» our

The afliitance lent us Tiv Fiance was as
forded by a reat lnd powerful nation,
efling numerous arr "
t*He Force to be contended with.âThe posi
tion of Europe was favorable to tlie enter
prise ; a general di'polition prevailing to fee
the power of Great-Britain abridged.âThe
co-ope ation of Spain was very much a mat
ter of course, and the probability of other
powers becoming engaged on the fame fide riot
remote.âGreat Britain was alone and likeiy
to continue soâFrance had a great arid"pÂ£r
fuafivc interest in the separation of this coun
try from Britain. In this jitnation with
much to hope and not much to fear, she took part
in our quarrel.
France is at this time Jiigh engaged with
the greatest part of Europe,' iiuliÂ«liÂ»g all the
firft rate powers, cscept one, and in danger
of being engaged with all' the rrft. To ale

<Jnifed State; are a young nation ; theiV po

âtheir refou' ces, though growing,not great ;
without armies, without fleetsâcapable f ojn
the nature of the country and the (pjrit of
inhabitant* of immense exertions for ielf:
defence, but little capable of those external,
efforts which could materiaily serve the cau r e
of Frame. So far from haying any. direct

have incomparably.more to apprehend, than
to hope. * 1 ' * <- ,M
This contrast of filiations and induce,
ments is alone a conclusive demonftra'iion,
that the United States are not under an obli
gation, from gratitude, to join France in the
war. The u'tcr disparity between the cir
curriftances of the service to be rendcrtd y and of
t : ie fefvice received, proves, that the one cannot
be an adequate basis of obligation fi>r the other
âThepe would be a want of equality, and

DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
in Philadelphia, May 30, 1793'
THE Rights of Man, the genuine
objects of society, and the legiti
mate principles of government, have been
clearly developed by the fncceffive revolu
tions of America and France. Those
events have withdrawn the veil, which
"eon ealed the dignity and the happiness
of the human race, and have taught us,
no longer dazzled with adventitious splen
dour, or awed by antiquated usurpation,
tÂ® erect the Temple of Liberty on the
ruins of palaces and thrones.
At this piopitious period, when the
nature of Fieedom and Equality is thus
practically displayed, and when theii va
lue, (belt undei flood by have
paid the price of acquiring them) is uni
versally acknowledged, the patriotic mind
will naturally be solicitous, by every pro
per precaution, to preserve and perpetu
ate the bit* flings which Providence hath
bestowed upon our country ; âfor, in re
viewing the history of nations, we find
occasion to lament, that the vigilance of
the people has been too cafily absorbed
in victoryâand that the prize, which
|ias been atchieved by the wisdom and
valour ot one geneiation, has too often
been loft by the ignoiance and fupinenefa
of another.
With a view, therefore, to cultivate a
just knowledge of rational liberty, to fa
cilitate the enjoyments and exercise of
our civil rights, and to transmit, unim
paired, to posterity, the glorious inherit
ance of a free Republican Government,
the Democratic Society of Pennsylvania
is constituted and established. Unfetter
ed by any religious or national diftinfti
ous, unbiafTed by party, and unmoved by
ambition, this inlitutinn embraces the
imereft 2nd invites the support of every
virtuous citizen. The public good is,
indeed, its fok object, and we think that
the belt means are pursued for obtaining
ft, when we recognize the following, as
the fundamental principles of our afiocia
tioth
That the people have the inherent and
exclusive right and power of making and
altering forms of government ; and that
for regulating and protjfting our social
interests, a Republican Government is
the most natura 1 and beneficial form which
the wisdom of man has devised.
Thai the Republican Constitutions of
the United States, and of the State of
Pennsylvania, being framed and establish
ed by the people, it is our duty, as good
citizens, to ftipport them. And in order
effe&ually to do so, it is li'kewife the du
ty of every freeman, to regard with at
tention, and to discuss without fear, the
condu<3 of the public fetvants, in every
ficpanment of government.
111.
That, in considering the administration
of public affairs, men and measures (hould
be estimated according to their intiinfic
merits; and therefore, tegardlefs of party
spirit or political connexion, it is the du
ty of every citizen, by making tha gener
al welfare the rule of his conduct, to aid
and approve those men and measures that
have an influence in promoting the prof
ptrity of the commonwealth.
IV.
' That in the choice of persons to fill'the
ofÃcts of. povernmeijt:,. it is effcnUaltQ.thc
Â«xiftence of a free-Republic, that every
ciciien ftiould aft-according to his own
and, therefore, any attempt to
corrupt or delude the people in esercifing:
-the lights of luffrage, either by pro mi f
ing the faviilr of nnc-eandvhrte, or tra
ducing. the chai after of another, is an-of
fence equally injurious to moral reflitude
and civil liberty.
That the People of PennffJvanw form
but one indivisible community, whose po
litical rights and interests, vrhofe nation
al hoaour and profpetity must, in degree
and duration, be forever the fame } and,
therefore, it is the duty of every freeman*
aad (hall be the endeavor of the Demo
cratic Society, to remove the prejudices,
to conciliate the afftftions, to enlighten
the uoderftanding, and to promote the
happiness of all our fellow citizens.
Having united under these principles,
we adopt the following rules and regula
tions for tranfafiing the bufine'fr ef the
inftitation.
Article I,
The Society (hall be co-extensive with
the State, bnt for the convtniency of the
members, thÂ«n (hill be a Ceparate meet
ing in tlte city of Philadelphia, and one
in each county, which (hall chufe to adopt
this conftitutifn. A member admitted in
the city or in any county, (hall of eourfe
be a member of the Society at laige, and
may attend any of the meetings wherever
held.
ARTÂ»CL'E 11.
A meeting of the Society (hall be held
in the city of Philadelphia, on the firft
Thai May in every month, and in thÂ» ft
fpefltve counties as often and at iuch
times as they (hall by their own rul<Â» de
termine. But the PrefidtDt of each re
fpe&ive meeting may convene the mem
bers on any special occasion.
Arttclf 111.
The ele&ion of new members and of
the officers of the Society lhail be by bal
lot and by a majority of Â»he votes of the
members present at each refpedlive meet
ing. But no new members (ball be voted
for at the fame meeting at which he u
piopofed. The names of the members
proposing any candidates for admission
(hall be entered in a book kept for that
putpofe. Every member on his admission
(hall fubferibe this conltitution and pay
the sum of half a dollar to the Tteafurer
for the use of the Society.
Auticle IV. _ â¢
The officers of the meeting in tin city
of Philadelphia (hall consist of a President,
two Vice Presidents, two Secretaries, one
Treasurer, and a Coirefponding Commit
tee of five members ; and the meetings of
the refpeÂ£tive counties fÃall cbufe a Presi
dent and such other officers as they think
proper. The officers of the meeting held
in the city of Philadelphia ftiall be chosen
on the firft Thursday in January io cy' Y
Article V.
It shall be the duty of the Correspond
ing Committee, to correspond with the
various meetings of the Society and with
all other Societies, that may be ettabliih
ed on fitnilar principles, in any other of
the United States,and to lay all communi
cations which they (hall make ajid receive,
together with such other business as they
fUull from time to'tirae deem proper, be
fore the Society at a meeting held within
their refpe&ive counties.
Article VI.
It (hall be the duty of the Secretaries
to keep minutes ot the proceedings of the
several meetings; and-of the Treasurers,
to receive and account for all monies to
tbeta refpe&ively paid.
{CIRCULAR^
Fellow Citizen,
WE ha<ve the pleafute to commu
nicate to you-a copy of the con
(litution of " Twe Democrat*Â® Soci
itt," in hopes that after a candid con
sideration of its principle* and obje&3,
you may be induced to promote ittadop?
tion in the couÃty, of which you. are an
inhabitant.
Every mind capabb of tefle<sioo/moft
perceive, that the present crilis in the
politics of nations, is particularly intcreft
ing to America. The European confe
deracy, tranfeendent in power, a.nd un
paralclled in iniquity, menaces the very
exiltence of freedom. Already its bane
ful operation may be traced in the tyran
nical deftruftion of the conrtitution, and
the rapacious partition of the territory of
Poiand : And ihouM the glo.ripus eflbrts
of France be eventually defeated, we have
rcafon to prefome, that for the consum
mation of monarchical ambition, and the
security of its eltablifliments, this coun
try, the only remaining depoihory of
472
Libm?, wilt not Jong tic pet netted to
enjoy in peace the twflwi Â°' mdepen
daut, and lilt happioels of* lepubiicau
government.
Nor are the dangers arising from a fo
reign foirrce, the only ca tiles, at this time,
of apprehetifioti and solicitude. The
feeds of Luxury appear to have taken
root in our domestic foil; and the jealous
eye of patriotism already regards
the spirit of freedom and equality, as
eclipsed by the pi ide of wealth and rhear
roga<ice of power.
This gtnersl view of oiir fitnation, has
ted' tb the institution of " Thb Demo
cratic Society 1 ." A constant circula
tion of ufeftil information, and a libetal
communication of republican sentiments,
were thought 10 be the best antidotes to
any political poison, with which the vital
principles of civil liberty irrghtbe attack
ed ; Foi by such means, a fraternal confi
dence will be eftablilhed among the citi
zens ; every symptom of innovation will
beftudioufly marked ; and a ttandaid will
bfl ere&ed, to which, in danger and dif
trefi, the friends of liberty may fuccefs
fully r^fort.
To obtain these objects, then, and to
cultivate on all occasions, the love of
peace, order, and harmony ; au attach
ment to the constitutions, and a refpeA
to the laws of our country, will be the
ajm of" The Democratic Society-."
Party and personal con liderations are ex
cluded from a fyllem of this nature ; for,
in the language of the Articlej under
which we are united, men and measures
will only be eltimated aceording to their
intrinsic merits, and their influence in
promoting the prosperity of the state.
From you, Citizen, we hope to derive
efiential aid, in extending the focicty
and maintaining its genuine principles.
Ws request, therefore, an early attention
to the luhjedt, and solicit a constant cor
lefpoudeiice.
We are with e-ftce-m your
Fellow Citizens.
