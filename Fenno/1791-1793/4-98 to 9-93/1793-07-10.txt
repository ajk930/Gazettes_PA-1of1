t; â "â "T-ir
Df.rtc of ]Â«l*e cccluJcJ from our hfl. '
IN case, I am aware that it
. to only fÂ»id the.veJTel ** teaiujin tt pa,"
but it' not, it rather appears that it would t.e
morr proper foi a diplomatic tÂ»ian a judiciary
examination. The ginfcrii principle as to
the capture b agreed ; and is fi;ni!ar to that
eftabliihed in our treaty with France, which
ought to have its proper weight.
" It *ai resolved, by the whole court of
King's Bench, upon conference and delibera
tion, that the Spaniard whole (hip had been
taken by an enemy and brought into England,
a friend to both parties, had loft the property
of the goods forever, and had no remedy for
thpm in England. And relied principally up
on the book, in 2. R. 3. Ã¼bi l'ppra bei'pg of Co
great authority iV by that book he that will
sue to have restitution of the goods rubbed at
sea, ought by law toprove two things, ift,
that the sovereign of the plaintiff was, at the
time of taking, in amity with the King of
England ; 2d, that lie who took tlie goods
was, at the time of takmg, in amity with the
sovereign of him whose gflros were taken,
For, if he who took them was in enmity vit&
the sovereign of him whole goods were taken,
then was it no depredation or robbery, but a
lawful taking, as every enemy might take
from another." 4. ins. 154-
It is true thai by the laws and customs <?f
nations, the capture if taken in neutral
bound-?, is not a lawful prize, but I 00 not
fee that this court can get at that circwa
(lancc without holding plea as to the laaju/urjs oj
the prize. It-is the original question and not
collateral matter whicn determines ji.r.idie
tion. The courts of common law in England
will not take cognizance of any thing arifirig
out of the qtieftion prist or no 44 because
the original caufc muitall come into question
again." And yet the admiralty had deter
mined that the ship was no prize.
This will be a proper.fubjeft of enquiry
on the part of oiir government or in a court
of the country of the captor. Every nation
has established theft courts and knowing that,
if at war, they are anfwerab'e tÂ° a nation at
peace or in amity, if violations oi territory
happen in capture*, care is taken to examine
into this cii'curnfta"ce. It. on tl
tne capture islllegr.l vt n 10 adjudged ; and
tfte party taken is liable to damages. Wpe-.
ther fnch damages fliatl exceed tne- amount
of the fecuri'y given by commanders of pri
vate (hips oi'war. or whether one nation is
answerable for injuries, done by its lubje<scs to
ethers, contrary to, or without its orders, is
a matter in which there are differences of
opinion among Civilians, and which it is un
nrceffary for me now to inveftig^te.
It is doubtleSj contrary to the inftrumons
of the French government, that any of the
fliips commissioned by them, a& in a hofcile
manner, in a friendly and allied terr itory. It
is to be expe&ed by one power from another,
that her cocts and her administration will
dojuftice to the rights of fovercignty and
neutrality- It will be the more to be la
mented if a friend and ally should disappoint
this expectation.âBut ftionld this be the cafe,
it is not forme to lay what proceedings fb< uÂ»d
be had. I have subjoined to this decree some
extra&s from the 44 Expflftio" oj the Motives,
&<r. from the Duke of New-Caftje, the i
tifji Mini Tver's Letter to Mr. Mitchell toe
Mmilter of Prussia, and from the report and
opinion of Sir George Lee, Do&or Paul, Sir
Dudley Rider, and Mr. Murray, tbe late
Lord Mansfield, on the fubje&s, I have men
tioned. which are to be fouud in
463, 482, 437, 49' < 496, t
Other authoiities trom Rritilh and other
writers might be added, by which it appears;
that when two powers have any d.ffeience
between thern, the affair mud be treated oy
negotiation, and not through the instrumenta
lity of their courts of justice.
That affairs of prizes are only pognizablc
in the courts of the power of making the cap
ture, these courts being genera!.y flyled
courts of admiralty ; and that it never was
attempted, before the fubjjeft of that contio
verfy happened, to erect in a neutial State,
courts for the trial of prizes taken by belli
gerent powers, even where neutrals were
concerned; and that of course 110 court of
one fovercign has a -ight to try the prizes
taken by the fliips public or private of ano
ther.
A difpirte of this nature ip which the King
of IVuflta could not prevail* though weak
at fen was powerful at lan<', and had a pio
ponfity for war, would illy fu't us. We nave
indeed, (hewn that we know how to war,
but it is now our interest and inclination to
cultivate the arts of .peace.
Much has been said on both fids*, to (new
the importance of this cause, and the necelL
ty of caution in its determination. I am
fufficie tly imp re fled with these considera
tions. Bat I feel niyfelf at ease in th;s view
of the fuKjecl. 1 am periurded, that an)
thing which affe&* the sovereignty and rights
of our country, will not be palled unnoticed
by those who have the power to regulate oui
national concerns. On my W account J

froift any 'determination I may give, to afu

FOR THE GAZETTE.
AT HIRD'objeftion to the proclamation is,
that it in inconsistent with the gratit jde
to France, for tlte services rendered us
fir our own revolu'ion.
Those who make this objection dil'.ivow at
tiK fa me time, all intention to advocate the
.position, that the United States ought to take
,<>art in the war. They profefs to be friends to
our remaining at peace. What then do they
mean by the objaflion ?
If it be no breach of gratitude to refrain
from joining France in the warâhow can it
h? a breach of gratitude to declare that such
is onr dirpofition and intention !
The two portions are at variance with
each other ; and the true inference is, either
that those who make the objection really wifli
to engage this country in the war, or that they
Itek a pretext for cenfttring the conduct of
. the cl)ief inagiftrate, for some purpose very
different from the public good.
Tiiey endeavor in vain to elude this infer
ence by faying, that the proclamation places
France upon an equal footing with her ene
mies ; while our treaties require diftinftions
rÂ»ybrcforrVti m>dMW. relative ftfuatian. would
dictate kind offices ro her, which ought not to
be srrtnted to ber adversaries.
They are not ignorant, that the proc!amation
-* reconcileable with both tho 'e oljefts, as
far aÂ« tliey have any foundation in truth of
propriety.
It has been (hewn that the promise of a
" friendly and impartial contiad" towards 11
the belligerent powers is not inconfiflient with
tlie performance of any stipulations in our
tieaties, w.hich would not include our be*
coming an aipjeiate in the war ; and it has
b en observed, that the conduct of the exe
cutive, in regard to the feventeer.th and
twenty-second articles of the treaty of com
merce, is an unequivocal comment upon those
terms. The expreflions indeed were natu
rally to be underhood with the exception of
those matters of positive compatt, which
-wwttld not amount to taking part in the war ;
for a nation then observes a friendly and im
partial conduct, towards two contending pow
ers, when it only performs to one of thein
what it is obliged to do by the positive stipu
lations of' antecedent treaties ; those Itipu
larTons not amounting to a participation in
t be war.
Neither do those expreflions imply, that
United States will not exercise their dis
cretion, in doing kind offices to some of the
parties, without extending them to the others;
so long as thoJe offices have no relation to war : For
'kind ofnees of that description may, confid
ently with neutrality, be fhewti to one party
at>d refufed 10 another.
If the objectors, mean, that the United
States ought to favor France, in things relating
to war and where they are not bound to do it iy
treaty ; they must in this cafe also abandon
their pretetfton of being friends to peace.
For such a toriduft would be a violation of
neutrality, which could not fail to produce
war.
It follows theft that the proclamation is re
concile able with all that those who cenlure it
contend for ; taking them upon their own
groundâthat nothing is to be done incom
patible with the preservation of peace.
gut though this would be a fufficient un
fair to tile undt-r coftfideratlÂ«Â»i;
yirt it may not be without use to indulge fwne
reflklion's on this very favorite topic of gra
titude to France ; lince it is ar this shrine we
are continually iuvted to facrifice the true in
terefls of the country ; as if â¢' all for love and
the world welUoJl" were a fundamental maxim
in politics.
Faith and juft'ce between nations are vir
tues of a nature sacred and unequivocalâ
They cannot be too ftrorgly inculcated, nor
tno highly refpefted. Their obligations are
cefinite and positive, their utility unqutT
tionabfe : they relate to objects, whicb with
probity and sincerity generally admit of be-
j n . A brought within clear and intelligible
rales.
and how far it can juftifiably lÂ«e permitted t(>
operate is always a cjiieftion of ftitl greater
difficulty.
The basis of gratitude ij n benefit received ur
KrtfnM, which there was no right to claim,
nating in * regard to the intetej! or ackmtare of
tAe part\, on whom the benefit ij, oris meant ti> he
conferred. If a iepvice n rendered from views
relative to the immediate inn-reft of the par
ty, who renders it, and is pteduftive of -re
ciprocal advantages, there fefeins' fctiicciy in
such a cafe to be an adequate basis for a sen
timent like that of gratitude. The effect
would be difproportioned to the cause, if such
a service oui'Jit to beget more than a diipofi
tion to render in turn a correspondent good
office, founded on mutual interest Â»o<3 reci/irocil
advantage. But gratitude, would require
more than this j it would require to a cer
tain extent, even a Sacrifice of the inteteft

tereft on the part of the pertVn who eÂ«*vf*rÂ»
the benefit, than the pleafureof diairtifa grfod
action, occur every day among intfiVUfudls.
But among nations they perhaps never necur.
It may be affirmed as a general principle,
that the predorninanf motive of good offjrej
frtjnt one natipn to another is the interest or
. advantage of. the nation, which performs
them.
. Indeed the rule of morality is in this refppft
not cxattly the fame, between nations as {be
tween individuals. The duty of making its
own welfare the guide of its actions is much
stronger upon the fofmer than upon the la'*
ter ; in proportion to the greater magnitude
and importance of national compared with
individual happinefi, to the greater perma
nency of the effc&s of national than of indi
vidual conduct. ExÂ»ft'*ng millions, and for
fcbe mod part future generations arc cim--
cerned in the present measures of a govern
ment -while the contquence-; of the pri
vate ast ions of an individual, for the rrioflfc
part, terminate with himfelf, or are cfrcum
fcribed within a narrow compass.
Whence* it follows, that an individual may
on numerous occafious meritoriouily mdojs*
the emotions of" generosity and bene;Votan?e,
not oiily without an.eye to, but even at the
expense of his own inreiefl. But a govern
ment can rarely, if at all, be juftifiaMe.irt
pursuing a similar courfc ; and if it dois-OS
ought to confine itlelf within much .ftrifler
bounds.* Good offices which are indifÂ¥k> ent
to the interest of a nation performing them,
or which are compensated by the existence or
expectation of some reasonable equivalent*â
or which produce an effVntial good to the na
tion to which they are rendered, without real
detriment to the affairs of the nation render
ing them, prescribe the limits of national ge
nerosity or benevolence.
It is not meant here to advocate a policy
abfoiutely felfifli or interested in nations ; tyot
tofliew, that a policy regulated by their own
interest as far as justice and good faith per
mit, is, and ought to be their prevailing one ;
and that either to ajfcribe to them a different
print'pie of aftipn, or to deduce from tb*
fuppofitionof it arguments for a (elf-denying
and feif-facrificing gratitude on the part of *
nation, which may have received from ano
ther good offices, is to misconceive or mistake
what usually are and ought t" be the fptings
of national conduit.
Theft general reflexions will be auxiliary
to a just estimate of our real (ituation with
regard to France ; of which a clofcr view
will be taken in a succeeding paper.

Sitting of thp. Jacobins.
Jpril 6.
It was propol'ed to fend a deputa
tion from (lie Club to accompany
the CommiHioners of the Ooiiveiui
on into all the departments, tudif
feminate the " holy morality of the
Jacobins." This ineafure was op
posed by all the leading nietn&MS ;
â¢for two excellent icafons, jftr te
caufe the "fraternal debt" of the
Club was, already so great, that tbey
could not bear any new expences ;
and 2dly. that their deputies would
ccriainly be maflacred, for the Ja
cobins were held in thegreateft ab
horrence through all the depart
ments. That they were regarded
by the whole nation (the Sans Cu
lottes of Paris excepted) as a band
of aflaflins, who with Marat at their
head, were wantonly fpiliing tke
blond of the purest patriots. Thel'e
aflertious were proved by letters

tiotrof Boncor.feuil.read an addrels,
which t'.iev were going to prelent
to the Convention. The following
is an extract: " Legislators, An in
fernal faction influences the Con
veutionâa gang of villains are plut-.
lingand executing a countei-revo
i lutiun. We demand in the name ot
the law, in the name of the people,
that the Guadcts, the Vergnianx,
the Briliote, the Buzots, the Barba
rous, the Pctions be driven from a
inong yon.. Mountain of Sinai! on
thee the Mod High reposes himfelf;
in thee alone is founded our hope;
then wilt thou deliver ns from our
enemies; but how long wilt thou
fuffer those Catalines in thy bolom ?
Ministers of an avenging God ! de
liver to the justice of the people his
unfaithful mandatories !âAnd thou
people !__ rife and cruth the traitors
who are in this aflembly." (Long
8c loud applause.) " Yes my friends
and brothers, continued the orator,
the people nittft help ns again to
cleanse the dung hill of ariltocra
cy."
Albitte.âl applaud with all my
heart the patrioiifmuf those citt
lens ; but while Uriving to serve us,
rbey will enibarrafs us; it is not iut
ficient to deihaifd the punifliment ot
traitors; we mult know them be
fore we can judge them. âAt thele
Words, the tribunes, and all the Ja
cobins rose in a fury, crying.â' We
know thein ail, and will kill them
all.'-âAfter much confufion in the
Club, Albitte recommences with his
lall sentence ; but was ftopt again
by loud murmurs. The Vice-Pi eli
dent begs them to hear Albitte with
moderation, and then refute him.
âWhat ! cries a hot patriot, foam
ing with rage, hear a moderate with
moderation ! Albitte continues, lam
not a moderate, 1 fublcribe to every
thing you propose. it is true there
are traitors in the Convention, hut
our denunciations ought not to con
demn them ; they mult be judged
by the law. For my own part I will
noc condemn Briflot and the relt on
a mere suspicion. He was again in
terrupted by a cry of " down with
t he moderate."âHo rose once more,
and laid if he was wrong, it was by
excels of zeai ; promised to conform
to the decisions of the Club ; was
wow convinced theaddrefs was good,
and deelared he would fiipport it.
This repentance was now too late ;
a general hiss proved to him, that
to ait from reason was an unpar
donable crime among the Jacobins.
Dellieux supported the petition
with all his might. He pretended
to prove that Petion, Briliot, &c.
were the agents of Dumourier, and
that they, with the other modera
tes, wanted to facrifice the virtu
ous Egalite because his foil Was a
traitor.
St. Ju(l Paid, 1792, 1 told you there
was but one man that ftopt our pro
gress, his head is fallen. We had.
better Iwim to liberty through oce
ans of aristocratic blood, than to
fee a single patriot receive a scratch.
Albitte talks of forms and lawsâas
if any were to be observed in such
a crisis. We mult have blood, the
country is in danger; Dutnourier
is gone but his fatallites are among
us; they mult be delivered up to
the revolutionary tribunal, and to
the National Razor. (applauded
with transport.)

PARIS, April 9.
AT four in the afternoon of ycfterday
the following Bulletin was cfcfiVerea ia

" Ye Herd ay morning Philip Egalite
was conveyed to the prison la Concierge

which was once destined for the too cele
brated Cardinal dc Roban. It is said, tint
on entering this apartment, Egalite fan
cied he perceived some partiality, Tome
paiticularattemion towards himtslf whifili
might hurt the feelings of his fellow pvi
foncrs ; and that he in corifequence de
manded for Citizen Egalite, the apart
ment ala Pifto'.e ; It will do doubt be
granted him to-morrow.
" By the apartment a la Pistole is
meant a particular room for which tea
livres are paid at entrance. The furoi
ture of this room consists of a table plac
ed before a-window, fccuredby iron bars,
a chair of walnut wood, and a bed fur
nilhed with a bundle of straw, and oÂ»cr
that a mattrafs of the thickness of a pan
cake that has not swelled in frying! At
one of the fides of the apartment a la Pis
tole arc two beams, the fupcrior fnrface
of which is ufualiy (lored with moifclsof
black tripuldy bread, left there by male,
factors condemned to the gtlleys, the

a la Pistole looks into a superb fqnare, iii
the midst of which riles a magnificent
poll that has appended to it a coHar of
superlative beauty. [By the.dtfcription
thfs would appear to be a kind of pillory]
This collar is uot like that of the cardinal
de Rohan, enriched with the spoils of
Golconda and Vifapour ; but in the eyes
of Egalite poffeffea a pre-eminent merit j
that of being fitted to all, of being alike
calculated to adorn the neck of the de

The defeat was fi> coinpleat, that

was very great. The regiment of

certain nieafures which appear to
be pursuing, tending to a breach of
the neutrality of this country, and
contravening the proclamation of
the Prefidem of the United States.
In difcufling the fubjeft, such evi
dence was adduced as amounted to
proof, that the brig lately called
the Little Sarah, had been armed in
this port, and was probably bound
011 a cruise againlt the powers now
ac war with KrapceâWhereupon a
large and refpet&able committee
was appointed to wait on the Go*
vernor of the State, and the heads
of departments in the general go
vernment, to make enquiry into the
business, and to afceriain what niea
fures had been adopted to check a
procedure so alarming to t he intei eft
and honor of the United States.
We are informed that theGover
norgave the committee the strongest
allurances of his having done, and
that he fliould continue to do, every
thing in his power to secure a ftriet
adherence to the neutrality pro
claimed by the President of the
United States.
Spirited meafuresare pursuing to
place the Fortifications in the river
in such a fiiuation, as that the sove

is plainly seen. Along it negroes from the
country were continually travelling on the
22d;artd23d; supposed to be carting in, 111
coftfecjuence of tiie proclamation, to reinforce
the commissioner's party.
On the 24th, all the (hipping that could pof
fiblv put to lea, American as well as the
! Frenchfleet of merchantmen bound toFrance,
1 left the'Cnpe under the convoy of she fh'ps of
war for this place. Many of tfiefe vetTels
were in want of almost every thing for even
Â»fhÂ»n voyage, it was therefore impoflib'e for
nSercTiantmerr to attempt to iÂ«Bch
their defined European ports.
The eomniiffioners, prior to these dillurb
ances, had ordered Gen. Galbaud, but lately
arrived from France as comna::d;r in chief
of the ifiaiid, back to France, for having acted
iir fofnÃ refpetts,' as they conceived, improper
ly, while they (the coinmiffioners) were at
Port-au-Prince.
The naval force at the Cape, Capt. Jones
Hates at three 74's, besides some vefTels of
lelTer force. The fleet of merclianlir.en, in
all, upwards of too fad.
Capt. Jones further informs, that the offi
cers belonging to the Britilh sloop <A war,
Hyjfcn i, a prize taken into Cape-Francois, l>y
the French men of war, were preferred by
the greatest exertions. Beingcondu&ed .down
to the American wharf, by some of the ne
groes who spoke English, they immediately
leaped off and were taken up by the American
boats, and conveyed on board the French ships.
Capt.' Jones saw a number of the inhabitants
of the Cape prcferved in the fame manner.
The brigs Active, Waters ; Hope, Poo! ;
fchoor-er Jjiio, Tanner, and two fchncners
belonging to Baltimore, left the Cape with
Capt. Jonesr-ali the other vefiels that were
there went to leeward.
Capt. Jon.-s made very particular enquiry
for the fafety of the Americans, arid is happy
to inform, that -all escaped, except Meifts.
Not and Miller, of Charleston, South-Carolina,
who were miffing.
It is Paid that the 3ritilh prisoners at the
Cape, amongst whom were the officers, ma
rines, and.seamen belonging to the privateer
Hyiena, (capturcd only a saw days before the
melancholy event took place) put themlelves
under the command of a Britilh officer, and
fought bravely by the fide of the French fol
dicry and sailors wider Gen. Galbaud, against
the "commissioners, mulattoes and negroes.
IfGalband, had ftoorl out J minutes longer,
it is thought he must have gained a viflorv ;
he, however, withdrew the troops avd went
on board the French ships of war, after fight,
ing three days, and with him took the Britilh
officers, &c. who had so courageonlly assisted

nothing to oppo'e tiienij ruihed in with demo

So far a 5 information has been obtained, the
terrible catastrophe which has just h*p.pcncd to
Cape-Francois, appears to have onginated in a
competition For power between the Com iriif
fioners, and thÂ« newly appointed Governor of
Hifpanipla. By this melancholy instance, wc
mav fee that nothing is facrcd or humane
which comes in competition with a gratifica

The anniversary of Independence has" hern
more extensively celebrated rhis year than usual.
Ir affords pleasing rcflc&ions to the patriotic
mind to observe such a fpirii ol union and fra

States. The acknowledgment of ibe blcflings
of Independence as fscured by a jult and ener

lentiments expressed on this occasion ; whilfr-a
genertfns wish for the freedom and happMefsof

Powell, the calibrated pedellrian, has paid
the last debt of nature. He died on the 1 Jth
April last, at his apartment at New-Inn, Lon
don. His extraordinary feats of walking, by
which he might with proper management
have benefited To much, never produced him
enough to keep him above the reach of indi
gence. Poverty, which he ought always to
have kept a day's march behind him, was hij
constant companion in his travels through
life even to the hour of his death.
