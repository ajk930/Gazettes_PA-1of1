LAW CASE.
Robert Findhy, jun. and other J, )
C Lilef filed.
Ship William.
fficetch of the Pleadings in this important cafe,
concluded.
Mr, Lewis on the part of tne libellaots.
THE honor and dignity of the United States,
he were deeply involved in Â»he de
ciiion of this cafe ; it involves a violation of
Ihe peace of the country ; for if when two
powers are at war, one may invade our ter-
Titory, our commercial Jntercourfe wfth fo
reign nations, and our tranquility become
-BjareriaUy interrupted. Was this an abso
lute government, where the sovereign, oi his
own free will, can repel force by force, the
femedy in a similar cafe would be at hand,
and be adequate : But as in our government
the Executive is far from unlimited, a court
of admiralty, forming its decision on the prin
ciples of the law of nations, is the proper tri
bunal for the trial of such causes. On the
ground upon which the counsel on the other
fide wiftied to put the business, it would ap
pear, that our only remedy would be, in cafe
a little privateer chose even to cut enemy's
veiTels from our very wharves, for the Pi efi
dent to request, without an opportunity of
commanding restitution. He hoped, for his
j>art, that the President would never again be
placed in the di(agreeable situation that lie
was not long since, when a who'.e week had
elapsed after his pleafnre was known, before
restitution was made of a late capture. Ii the
of the court is not sustained, tlren
we are not on an equal footing with other na
tion"; we can only rcmonltrate and pray
for rcftitntion in cale of infringement, and
history teaches us, that a nation without a
tefpe&able armed force, is the furferer by eve
ry negotiation. It has been observed, that
our meddling in matters of the nature of the
cautc before the court would tend to involve
us in war; he rather conceived, that our per
fuitting one nation to annoy its enemy with
in otir jurifdittion without our resenting the
inJuit, have that effect ; indeed, if the
privateer was authorised to co what (lie has
<lone the ast is tantamount to a declaration
of war. He dwelt on the importance of pre
serving peace, and he conceived that a de
cision in this court, agreeably to tlÂ»e law of
rations wou4 teno to effect that deferable ob
jca.
Tits count;! on the other fide had
cstftii% cogniaance at' the prelfcnt caute would
be a violation of the treat*, ami that in call
of a violation on our part the whole treaty is
virtually annulled. The court he was Core,
â vera not to-be-intimidated by such argument ;
Indeed if the treaty is violated, it certainly
is by the flibjeifts of that nation to whom the
privateer helufij>s.
We have bt'cn told said Mr. Lewi-s, that
the court isÂ«not competent to relief in all ca
ses of this kind ; that the William could have
been taken to,Cape-Francois, or any trh< rÂ«
else out of its jnrifdiftion. It might hipperi,
and it often does happen he said, that a cri
minal efdapes atrial in a court within the ju
rifdidfcion of wbieh he has committed an of
fence ; the argument goes only to (hew the
inadequacy of all human institutions in cer
tain cases i hut certainly while we hold the
criminal we ftiuuld inflict the punilhinent.
It had been said, that the court had .not the
power of bi*if>ss impartial i,n the bufinefi, they
could no* condcinn the prrft. He contended,
that there was no jult foundation for this
charge of partiality j IhwiVd a Britilh priva
teer ever be in the lituation of the I'rench is
this instance the law to him would be as it is
to the French in this ca e.
â  ,r \
It bad been said that the owner of the lh:p
William had a remedy by applying to the
court of admiralty, who fliould condemn the
prize in France. On this he remarked, that
there appeared little difpofitiou on the part of
Hiofe concerned in the Citizen Getiet, to take
the William to France, and that a plea could
not be held theie unless the prize was actu
ally brought within the juiifdiftion of that
court. Beside*, though the court in France
might determine whether the capture was le
gal, yet they would do it without an eye to
her being taken within our territo y, leaving
the vindication of our rights of fovtreignty
to ourselves.
He cited 2 Vat 92 tn shew, that it is un
lawful to enter a neutral country in a hostile
manner.
It had bee* said, that this is a cause be
tween the citizens of Great-Britain and the
citizens of France, he considered it as the
eanfe of America herfelf, in as much as it
was the intevefl and duty ef this c ountry ro pre
fer ve a ftri& neutrality : and fiie will he cal
led upon he added for fatnfa&ion, it the cap
ture is not restored, more particularly as the
p r ivateer that took the William was fitted
our in an American port.
I Vat. 289 fays, that veflfbls taken within
the distance of a neutral shore mentioned in
the pre Pent libel are not lawful, 3 Vat. I^2
to the fame point.
Molloy, P. 183 contain* a cafe in point.
LÂ«?e 12l records, that the Romans did not
venture to pursue the Carthaginians into the
port of a neutral prince ; but he had an arm
ed force to make his port refpe&ed ; were we
in the fame fituacion, we (houid not be injured
by the English folding our polls in spite of
treaty, nor insulted by a violation of our ter
ritorial rights by a French privateer.
The P *efident it was said fhou'd l?e applied
to for a of this bufiiefs, that there
is 110 instance of a cause of this kind being
brought into a court of admiralty. No, an
absolute monarch would have fettled 't with
out au admiralty court; but our executive has
no strong arm to enforce obedience to its de
cision ; the cau e is therefore brought here in
a court wliich is guided by the principles of
the law of nations, free and impartial to all.
He further answered to the ojjc&ion, that
no instance can be produced of a llmilar cafe
b.;frig brought into a court of admiralty, that
this only (hewed, that the privateer had gone
further than any one before her ; after in
juring our trade by watching off our rivers
and bays for veXels, after ha/ing made a
capture on our territory, they had added in
fu't to injury and brought the prize to our ve
ry feat of government an ast altogether un
precedented for audacity.
Mr. Lewis insisted on the propriety of not
parting with the property captured without
obtaining redress for the violation of our neu
tral ty; the court does want to fettle whether
there was fufficient cause of rupture between
France and England ; but we have a right to
detain thecaptuie to secure ourselves.
He adverted to the treaty. The prÂ©vi
fions of it are Airily not intended, he said, to
prevent our enqui'ing whether 3 violation
has been committed on our rights of territory.
If this fliould be the conftruftiou, how can the
Prelident, or even Congrcls interfere without
a violation of the treaty ?
Mr. Lewis concluded by referring to Lee
86, 87,93, 94, 95,9 6 Â» 78 and 79Â» ** containing
information on the present cafe.
This mutilated and cramped account will
fervc to give but a faint idea of the mafteriy
manner in which Mr. Lewis handled the cafe.
It is far less diftinft or complete than our
sketch of the obfervattons which fell from the
other counsel on this question ; the rapidity
of bis utterance must plead our excuse.
Judge Peters deiiveied his decree for dif
mifling the present libel as lelevantâwhich

GEOGRAPHY OK THE WAR,
AT THE PRESLN'T MOMENT:
It may be fatisfaftory, perhaps,
to foine who are defiroos to form a
just idea ot the tranfatftions in the
present war between France and
the Allies, if we point out the dif
ferent fltuations of the armies op
posed to each other. First, the
Prince of Cobonrg, at the head of
the Austrian, Hanoverian, and Bi'i
ti(h troops in Flanders, 13 begging
the towns of Conde, Valenciennes,
&c. on the northern frontiers of
France. If we then carry our eve
alongthemap to the eallward for
2>o miles, welhall find the cities of
Mentz and Caflel, (which (land op
pofiie to each othei on the banks of
rhe Rhine) closely besieged by the
Prnlfian General Kalkreuth. At
tending the Rhine about fifty miles,
we come to Spires, where General
Wurinfer, at the head of 40,000
Germans, is preparing to lay siege
to Landau, a Wrench town in Alsace,
which Marihal Vnnban employed
all his (kill in rendering one of the
ttroiigeft fortrellesin Europe. Pro
ceeding about twenty miles to the
fomhward, we find Ctiftine with the
remains of his army, which tlie
Ki"Â£ of Prnfiia has driven from the
Electorate of Mentz, encamped un
der the walls of Weillenbourg, in
Alsace.

Extract*tf a Utter Jrcm Lcnticm, dated May 1, to
a merchant in this irtr.
" I find that the situation of things at home
as well as abroad has brought Mr. Pitt to fay
very nearly as much as that he will treat with
the convention, or tile inen of the day if'no
better can be done. He is so much
at the home situation, that be will make
rertns with France, and next packet will con
firm to you what I now write."
fOR THE GAZLFTE.
THE second and principal ofcjeftion to the
proclamation, namely, (hat it is iti'con
filtent with the treaties between the Unite J
St:'"es an.d France, will now be examined.
It has been already !lic\Vn, that it is nnt in
confident with the performance of any of the
stipulations in thole treaties, which would
not make ns an alTociate or party in the v at
and particularly that it is incompatible with
the privileges secured to Fiance by the fe
venteentb and twenty-second articlei of the
Treaty of Commerce ; which, except the
clau r <* of guarantee, comlitute the most ma
terial discriminations to be found in our trea
ties in favor of that country.
Official documents have likewise appeared
in the pnblic papers, which are understood to
be authentic, that serve as a comment upon
the lenfe of the proclamation in this part ci:-
lar, proving that it was nto deemed by the
executive incompatible with the performance
of the ftipnlatio'ns in tbofe articles, and that
in practice they are intended to be obiervec 1 .
It has however been admitted, that the
declaration of netit'rality excludes the idea of
an execution of the clause of guarantee.
It becomes neceHary therefore toexanrme,
whether the United States would have a va
lid juftificatien for no' complying with it, iii
ca'e of the , r being called upon for that pur
pore by France.
Without knowing bow far the reasons"
which have occurred to me, may have influ
enced the President, there appear to me to
exist very good and fubftantiaJ grnan'ds far A
refufal.
The alliance between the United States
and France is a d-Jevfive alliance. In the cap
tion of it it Â»s denominated a u treatv of al
liance eventual and dejenfive." In the body of
it. (article second) it is called adefenfive alliance.
The, words of that article are as follow 44 the
efTential and dire<sl end of the present dcfcvfve
'affiance is to maintain eife&uajly the liberty,
sovereignty and independence absolute and
unlimited of the United States, as wdlfin
mat te v r Â«t r â¢?Â» <*-ef com me r ce.''
The predominant quality or character then
of our alliance wi:h France is, t'.<at it h'de
ftnfive in its principle, of course the meaning
obligation and force of every stipulation in
the treaty must he tested and determined by
that principle. It j's not necetfary (and would
be abTurd) that it lhould be repeated in every
article. 11 is fufHcienc that it be once de
clared, to big undferftood in every part of the
treaty, unless coup'ed with express negative
words excluding the implication.
The great queflion consequently :sâwhat
are the. nature and eueft of a defenfive alli
ance ? When does the cafus fcdeer is, or cords/ion
of the contra# take place, in such an alliance?
Reason, the concurring opinions of writers,
and the practice of nations will answer
u when either of the allies i* attacked, when
war is made upon him, not when he makes
war upon another In other words, the ft -
pulated afHUance is to be given to the ally
when engaged in a defcnficc, not when enga
ge/J in an o]f:nf,ve war. This obligation to
allift only in a defenfive war, the
eilential difference between a defenfive allir
ance and one which is both ofifcnfive and dr.
fenliye. In the latter cafe there is an obli
gation to co operate as well when the war on
the part of our ally is offenfive, as when.it is
defenfive. To affirm therefore, that the
United States are bound to allift France in
the war in which Ihe is at preient engaged,
would be to convert our treary with, her into
an alliance offenfive and defenfive, contrary
to the express and reiterated declarations of
the instrument itfelf.
This afljertion implies, that the war in
question is an ojfcnjivc war on the part of
France.
And To it undoubtedly is with regard to all
the powers with whom fl?e was. at war at the
tir.se ofifiuing the proclamation.
No portion is betrer eftablilhed, than that
the power which firjl declares, or ail tally begins
a War, whatever may have been the caul'es
leading to it, is that which makes an ojfcnjive
war. Nor is there any doubt that France
nrft declared and began the war, against Au
stria, Prussia, Savoy, Holland, England and
Spain.
Upon this point there is apt to be some in
corre&nefs of ideas. Thjofe who have not
examined fubjefts of such a nature, are led to
imagine that the party which commits the
firft injury, or gives the firft provocation, is
0:1 the offenfive fide in the war, though begun
by the other party.
But the cause or the occasion of the war,
and the war itielf, are things entirely diftinA.
Tis the commencement of the war itfelf,
that decries the question of being an the of
fenli ve or deienfive. Ail writers on the laws
ot nations agree in this principle, but it is
more accurately laid down in the following
extra<st f 0111 Burlcmaqui*
44 Ne:ther are we to believe (fays he) that
he rtho faji injures another, begins by tb?t
an war, and that the other uho dtâ¢janfo the fatiij&clijn 'for the injury reficitca,'
is aiwavs on the dejenfue. Then; are a great
many vnjuJl'dMs which may kindle a war, and
which- luwever are not the , war it felt"âas
the ill treatment of a prince's ambaiTadors,
the plundering of his fubje&s, &c."
" If therefore we take up arms to revenge
such an unjiiH aCI, we com.nence an off ' nfive
butajuft wai ; and the prince who has done
the injury, and will not give fatisfa&ion,
jnnke" a defenfive but an unjust war."
"We mult therefore affirm, in general,
that the firft who takes up arms, whether
jujily or uM/ufiiy, commences an ejfenjivc war,
and he who oppofas him, whether with or
without reason, begins a defunliye war."
France then being on the ojfcnfive in the war
in which she is engaged, and our alliance
with her being defenfrve only, it follows, that
the tafus foederis, or condition of our guaran
tee, cannot take place; and that the United
States are free to rcfufe -a peiformance of
that guarantee, if demardod
T''ofe who are dilpofed to juftify indiscri
minately every thing n the conduct of France,
may reply, that ih >ugh the war in point of
form may be ofFenlive on her part, yet in
point of princip'e, it is d*fenfiveâwas in each
instance a mere anticipation of attacks me
ditafed against her, and was jult fied by pre
vious a2,gieffions~of the oppoiite pa* ties.
It is b'-Heved, that it would be a ufiicient
anfwerto th s observation to lay, that hi de
termining the legal and po/iire obligations of
the United Sta s,the o ly point of inquiry is,
whether the war in fa I began by
or byher ene.nesâ' hat aM beyond tfii w >uld
be too var-;uÂ£, too liable 'o di'.pute, too uc 1
matter of opinio 1 ' i oe a f > oyer criterion o
rational to >dufr ; that when a war Breaks
out between two jation% all other nations, in
regard to the poutive rights of the p* ties,
and their p si ve duties toward; them, are
bou'd to coniitier it as equally jult on both
fid.' âthat co' equentlv in a dejenfue alliance,
when war is mile upon one of t : i; aliier., the
other is bound to fulfil the conditions ftipu-
on its part, v t lout inquiry, whetner rhc
war is rightfully begun or notâas, on ?:he
o* .er hand, when war is begun by one of the
allies, tilt other is exempted f om the obliga
tio ef lfifting ; nowever jnit the commence
jnent of it m.iy have been.
The foundation of this doctrine is, the -uti
lity of certain rules for determining
the reciprocal duties pi Â«atioris-Â»-that as littie
Â»s polSSle be left to opinion, andto the
fu' terfugejof a refining or unfaithful cafuif
tly ; . - â¢ .. .
Some writers indeed of great authority af
firm, rhjt ]t is a tacit condition of every
treat of aNiance, t >at 01 e ally is not bound
to afiilt the other in a war manifeftly unjust.
But this is queftio.ied on the ground which
has been stated by other refpeftable authori
ties And though the ina.iifeft: injnftice of
the war has been affirmed by lbinjy to be a
good cauf- for not executing the formai obli
gations of a treaty. I have no where found it
maintained, that the jultice ofa war is a con
fxderation which ran oblige a nation to do
wnat its formal obligat >ns d 3 not require ;
as in the cafe ofa dejcnjiiic alliance, to fu nifh
the luccours stipulated, though ti.e formal ob
ligation did notexift, by reason of the ally
having begun the war instead of being the
part-y attacked.
Bnt if t ! iis were not the true doftrrne, an
Impartial examination would "prove, that witl
refpeft to some of t ie powers, France is not
Wamelefs in the circumstances winch precedec
and led to the war with t'.iofe powers; thai
if flu eceived, lhe a!fo gave causes of of
fence, a d that the juftite of the war, on hei
fide, is in those caies not a littie problema
tical.
T iere are p u lential reaforls which difluade
from going largely into this examination, un
less it ihal! be rendered necelTary by the fu
tue tii' n of rhe dift ufiioii.
It will befn&cient here, to notice cursorily
tK following tufts.
Fiance co.nnitted an npon Hoi-
Jand in declaring fiee the navigation oi the
Sc'ieldt, and acting upon that declaration ;
contrary to Treaties in which she had expli
citly acknowledged and even guaranteed the
exclnfive right of Holland to the navigation
of that river, and contrary to the doitrines
of the best wrners, and the eftabliflied
of nations in such cases.
She give a general and just cause of alarm
to nation-?, by that decree of the 19th of No
vember f 1792, whereby tbe Convention, in
the name of the French nation, declare that
they will g ant Jraternity and ajjijlance to every
f topic who rvipi ro recover their liberty, and
charge the executive power to lend the necef-
A\ry orders to the generals to give aifiltance to
such people, and to defend thoje citizens who may
have been, or who may be vexed tor the caule
oflberty; which decree was 01 dered to be
printed in all languages.
â¢ Whim a nation has a&ually come to a refo-
Intiou to thraw off a yoke, under which it may
Have groaned, and to all'ert its liberties, it is
juftifiahle and meritorious in another nation
to afford afliltance ro the one which has been
opprelTed, and is in sheaS of liberating itleJf,
but it i% not warrantable for any nation bejore
koud to hold out a general invitation to inlur
feetion and revolution, by promising to assist
ctery people who may xuijh to recover their li
berty, and to defend those cuizcjis oi every
country, who may have been i or who may be vexed
jor the cauje of liberty' It ill le Is to commit to
the Genkr als of its armies the discretionary
power of judging, when the citizens of a fo
reign country have been vexed for the caul' 6
oi liberty by their own government.
The iatrer part of t'le decree amounted
to what France herfelf had molt com
p'jined of-**an interference by one nation in
i*: -* iutevnal government of another.
â¢ Vatel juillv o'.;fcrvÂ«-,, as a conlÂ«]uence of
li!Â»,-;tv and independence of nationsâ
-1 - does riot belong t) P.nV forv-ion quiver
to take cognizance of" the-adminiftratioYi -of
thejovereiga of another country, to ler-himfMf
up as a judge of bis cosdu&, : or to obiige iiun
to alter it." ' . '
Such a conduct as that indicated by this
decree, has a natural tendency to disturb the
tranquility of nations, to excite fermentation
and revolt every where; and thereforeju(li
fted neutral powers, who were in a lituation
to be aittrfted bv it, in taking me afu res to re
pre(s the Ipirit by which it had been dictated.
But the principle of this decrec received a
more particular application roGreat-Britain,
by some subsequent circumftarices,
Among the proofs of this are two answers,'
which were given by the President of the
National Convention, at a public fitting on
the 28th of to two clitivrent, ad
dre'Tes; one presented by a deputation from
" The Society for Constitutional Information
in London"âthe other by a deputation of
EngJifh and Iridi citizens at Paris.
The following are extra&s from these an
swers:
" The (hades of Fenn, of Hambden and of
Sydney, hover over your head'-; and tht mo
ment, wvjtout do-iht, approaches, in xvhich the French
will bring congratulation 's to the National Conven
tion of (treat-Britain."
" Nature and principles draw towards us
England, Scotland and Ireland. Let the cries
of friendÂ»h' p r-found through the two Repub
lics." 44 Principles are waging war agai'ift
tyranny, which will fall under the blows of
ohilftfbpliy. fto\a/f\ in Europe is eirh r dJlro\ed,
or on the point of perijh 'mg, on the ruins ot'fceo
dalit 1 ; and the declaration of rights phc db\ the
si le oj thrones, is a devouring fire which willco>J me
th m.â '/OR.THY REPUBLICANS, &C.
Declarations of this fort cannot but be con
sidered as a d eel application of the principle
of the decree to Great-Britain ; as an open
patronage of a revolution in that country ; a
ror.duct which proceeding from she head of the
body that governs France, in the pre r enee'
and on behalf of that body, was unquestiona
bly an orfence and injury to the nation to
which it related.
The dec ee of the 1 of November is
another cause of offence to all the govern
ments of Europe. Bv that decree 44 the French
nation declares, that it will treat as enemies the
penp/e, who re/nftng or renouncing liberty and
equality, are J /irons of preserving their prince
and privileged cajisâor of entering into an accom
modation with them y &zc." This dectte was
little /hort of a declaration of war a".ainft all
nations having princes and privileged chjfes.
The incorporation of the ten ",^ OJ ies, over
which the arms of France had temporarily
prevailed, with and as a part of herfelf, is mo
ther violation of the rights of nations, into
which the convention was betrayed by an in
temperate zeal, if not by a culpable ambition.
The laws of nations give to a power at war
nothing more than a u'ufrn&uary or pofleflo
rv right to the territories which it conquers ;
suspending the abfoHite property and $lpmi- 4
rtion til a treaty of peace or fometh'ng equi
valent shall cede or relinduifh the conquered
territory to the conqueror. This principle
is one of the greatest importance to the tran
quility and security of nationsâfacilitating
an adjuft.nent of their quarrels and the pre
servation of anc ent I'mits.
But France, by incorporating with herfelf,
in several instances, the territories she had
acquired, violated this important principle
and multiplied infinitely the oblfcacles of peace
and accommodation. The roftrine, that a
nation cannot consent to its own dfmember went, but
in a cafe of extreme necejjity y immediately at
tached itfeif to all the important territories :
while the progrefiive augmentation of the
dominions of the mod powerful nation in Eu
rope, on a principle not of temporary acqui
sition, but of permanent union, threatened
the independence of all other countries and
gave to neighboring neutral powers the juftelt
caufeof umbrage and alarm. It is a princi
ple well agreed and founded on the best rea
sons, that whenever a particular nation a
dopts maxims of conduct contrary to thofeV
generally established among nations, calcula
ted todiftm b their tranquility and to expose
their fafety, they may juitinabW make a com
mon cause to oppo.e and controul iuch na
tion.
Whatever partiality may be entertained
for the general object of the French revolu
tion, it is impofliole for any well informed or
fooer minded man not to condemn the pro
ceeding* which have been itated ; as repug
nant to the general rights of nations, to fl e
true principles of liberty, to the freedom of
opinion of mankind : and not to acknowledge
as a conlequence of this, that the justice oi
the war on the part of France, with regard
to some of the powers with which (he is en
gaged, is from those causes questionable
â¢ iough to free the United States from all
emb.tn aflfineAts on that score ; if it be at all
incumbent upon them to go into the inquiry.
The policy of a defenfive alliance is so ei
fentially diftinft from that of an otfenfive one,
that it is every way important not to con
found their eifc-(sts. The fir ft kind has in
view toe prudent o'ojeft of mutual
when either of the allies is invo'untarijy for
ced into a w ,r by t ie attack Â«f Tome
power. The iatter kind fubje&s the peace
of each ally to the will of the other, and obli
ges each to pa' fake in the wars of policy and
interest, as well as in those of fafety and de
fence, of the other. To preserve their boun
daries diftinft, it is necellary that each kind
(hould be governed bv plain andobviÂ«>us rules.
This would not be the cafe, if instead of
taking the simple fart of who begtftlfe the war
asagoide, it was neteffary to travel into
metaphysical nicetics about the juitice or in
justice of the causes which led to it- Since
also the not furnilhing a stipulated succour,
when it is due, is itielf a cause of war, it is
very requifice, that there ihould be fome^>al-

Rule sPOT and PEARL ASHES.
TO THE PUBLIC.
HAVING attended carefully to the
result of several comparative expe
riments, which were made to ascertain
the nature and merits of Samuel Hop
kins process for manufaÂ£tui ing pearl ashes
r>r calfined alkaline falls, we are of opini
on, that by his method wood ashes may
be made to yield 3 quantity of pearl arties
of a very fine white colour, equal in
weight and strength to the black or un
calfined alkaline salts which are obtained
by the ordinary method of leaching and
boiling down the black leys, so that the
manufadlorer who adopts this method,
will probably gain all the weight which is
loft by the ordinary process of callining,
and may effect the calfination in a much
easier manner. We also examined a fur
nace eiefted according to the directions
of Samuel Hopkins, and were present
during part of a process, which was con
ducted in it, and believe it to be so happi
ly construed as to effect the calfination of
wood ashes, and evaporate the ley# with
out more fuel than is used to boil down
the leys only by the common method.

June 17, 1793.
In addition to the foregoing certificate
I conceive it proper to inform the public
in what refpeft my process differs from
the nfual method, and to offer some direc
tions to such as may incline to adopt it.
l(t, This proceis consists in calfining
common house or field ashes in a furnace
of a peculiar conftrudtion so contrived,
that the fame fiie that boils down the
leys calfines the allies; hence it appears
there is not a greater consumption of
wood in this new procefsthan is necefTary
in the former, in obtaining black salts,
and the ashes from the wood for boiling
saved, which was before much loft, occa
sioned by the strong draught necefTary to
keep the kettles boiling.
2d. It is recommended to such as may
adopt this method, to pay patticular at
tention to the firft part of the process,
viz. calfining the ashes properly ; for this
being carefully performed, the fubfeqnent
steps become easy and less liable to fail.
3d. 1 he ashes should be spread over
the hearth of the furnace not more than
one inch and half thick, direst a lively
blaze on them until they become red hot,
keeping them frequently fturred, and the
dampers well closed.
4th. In order that the workman mav
know when his ashes are fufficiently burnt
until he becomes enough perfect in the
business, from other circumstances a small
parcel may be taken out and put in a
glass with water, if the ashes fettle quick
ly after fturring them, and the leys ap
pear colourless, they are ht for drawing
into the ash pit j if they arecalfined lon
ger the quantity may be diminished.
sth. After the fires begin to burn ev
ery part of the furnace should be kept as
close as poflible, the door of the alh pit
and hearth, and that for introducing the
ashes on the hearth (hould be made to
shut complete, for I have reason to be
lieve a great draught of ait carries off
much of the salts.
6th. Great care should be taken not
to. put more allies into the furnace than I
have direded above, it has been found
by experiments that when much more
have been put in ; Â»'ie salts are not so white
nor the quantity so great, I believe it
was for want of attention to this circum
stance and allowing too great a draught
of air, that some who attempted my pro
cess have not been foiuccefsful as was ex
pefled.
7th. The aihes are drawn from the
alh pit the next day after calfining and
put. into leach tubs the leys drawn from
them aftet fettling are boiled down, the
salts kept well fturred in hni/hing off, un
til they become perfe&ly white.
Bth. If the salts should not become
the colour as ia deferibed in the firft in
fiance, thro' an imperfetf calcination,
they may be diflolved, fettled, and boiled
down again.
The advantage arising from this pro
cess may be comprised under the follow
ing heads.
i ft. By calfining the allies before the
leys are drawn from them, we obtain as
great a quantity at lcaft of pearl ashes,
as of common black salts ; pearl ashes geÂ»
ncral!y fells when at maiket, Â£-$o per
ton, the iiighell price for black falls is
Â£.25 pei ton, and if converted into pearl
ashes, it requires as much more labour
and ruel as in the tirfl instance, and a Jof6
from 25 to 30 per cent.
The foregoing observations are inten
ded for such as are or may be engaged in
the manufa&oring of pot and pearl ashes,
they will easily undetftand the terms I

The two othets whose names are with
out references, are Phyficiansof this city,
have employed ; for the information of o
thers it may not be amiss to explain wha
is meant by black salts, pot ashes, ant
pearl ashes.
2d. Black salts are made by boiling
down the leys from common wood ashes,
until they aie perfectly dry.
3d. PoTafhea are made by melting the
black salts in a very strong fire and lading
it out into coolers.
4th. Pearl ashes are made by putting
the black salts into a furnace prepared fcr
the purpose, and throwing a strong blaze
on them ; this operation is called scorch
ing, they are then diflolved in water, fet
tled and boiled down again, returned
back into the furnace and calfined until
they are fufficiently white : Pot ashes
made from calfined ashes are allowed tobe
much superior to those made in the com
mon mode.
I expect the names and characters of
most of my fellow citizens that have
signed the foregoing certificate are well
known ; they are allowed to be well ac
quainted with chemistry ; a furnace was
erected for one of them who kindly un
dertook to make the necefTary compara

tions } the result of which is already set
forth.
SAMUEL HOPKINS.
6th Mo, 2 2d, 1793.
I do hereby certify, that I have erected
a small furnace, in the suburbs of this ci
ty, on the patent method, for the pur
pose of manufa&uring pot and pearl ash
es, which I find to consume on an aver
age no more than one cord of wood per
week ; two hands will calfcin 20 bushels
of allies per day, and bail down the leys
therefrom in the fame time, which if well
calcined will produce pearl alh the firft
boiling. The leys are not so apt to boil
over as those in the common method
The fxpence of the said furnace, exclu
sive of the boilers, did not exceed ten
pounds currency.
