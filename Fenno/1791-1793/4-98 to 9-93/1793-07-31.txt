AN ORATION.
IT has been a custom, fan&ioned by the uni
versal pa ft ice of civilized Nations, to ce
lebrate with anniversary solemnities, the re-
by events the mod important to the happiness
<?f the people. In co.unt. ies where the natu
ral dignity of mankind has been degraded by
the weakness of bigotry, or debaled by the
miseries of dsfpotifm, this cuflomary celebra
tion has degenerated into a servile mockery
of feftivity upon tbe birth-day of a fceptered
tyrant, or ha: dwindled to an unmeaning re
vel, in honour of some canonized fanatic, of
whim nothing now remains but the name, in
the calendar of antiquated superstition. In
those more fortunate regions of the earth
where Liberty has eon del tended to reticle,
t!>e cheerful gratitude.of her favored people
to innocent gaiety and i.fcful re
laxation from the toils of virtuous industry,
the periodical revolution of those days which
fcave been rendered iiiuftrious by the triumphs
of freedom.
AMERICANS ! Such is the nature of the in
stitution which again caJIV yoijr attention to
celebrate the establishment of your national
Independence. And fin ely fihee the creation
of the heavenly orÂ§ which fepa rated the (lay
from the night, amid the unnumbered events
which have diverfified the hiltory of the hu
man race, none has ever occurred mure high
ly defer ving of celebration by every species of
ceremonial, t'lat can teftify a lerife of grati
tude to the Pmty, and of happiness, derived
from his rranfeendent favours.
It is a wife and f'aiutary institution, which
forcibly recalls to the memory of freeflwn,
the principles uppn wheh they originally
founded their labouring plan of state. It is a
facrifice at the a tar of Liberty berfe'f*
renewal of homage to the Sovereign, who
alone is worthy of our veneration a pro
fcfUon of political fidelity, expreflive of our
adherence to those maxims of liberal submis
sion and obedient freedom, which in these fa
voirecl clime*, have harmonized the long
eontending claims of liberty and law. By a
frequent recurrence to those fentisrieMts and
$&ions upon which the glory and felicity of
the nation reft Purported, \ve are enabled to
renew the moments of biifs which we are not
permitted to retain ; we secure a permanen
cy to the exaltation which the Constitution cf
has rendered fleeting, and a perennial
fxiftente to enjoyment? which the lot of hu
manity has made tranlitory,
The 44 feelings, marr.Cis avd principles"

i a refuge for the vi'&im*; of perfctufion in
lie; old. The ieeiings />f injured freedom, the
manners of social equal ty, and the principles
of fteriMl justice.
Had the Sovereigns of England purfiiec? the
policy prefenbed by their interest, had tr-ey
not p ovoked fire hostilities of their Colonics
against the foebie fort re fs of their authority,
they might perhaps, have- retained to tivs Ha>
an Snip}ie which would have been but th<
more rlurab'e, for reiting only upon the.ioun
d ition of immemorial custom, and nation#
affection.
Incumbered however with the
glorv of a fuceef.ful war, which ha:i enriched
the pride of Britain, with the fpoiis oi 1e v owp
opulence, and replenished the arrogance in
proportion 39 it had eKhaufted rf e resources
of the nation; an adventurous miuiftry, catch
ing at every desperate expedient to fnpport
the ponderous burden of flic national dignify,
a*',d n.ijnu'a*6d by the perfidious mitigations
of thi\r dependent" ; ; ' s.
the profitable commercial policy of their pre
d?ceflors, and fu/)era<!ded to the lucrative
system of monopoly, which we had always to- !
lerated us the price of their_ protection, a sys
tem of internal taxation from which they
hoped to derive a fond for future corruption,
and a upply for future extravagance.
The nation eagei I.y grasped at the proposal.
The situation, the the Sentiments
of-tbe colonies, were futjefts upon which the
people of Britain were divided between igno
rance and erro'-. The endearing ties of con
sanguinity, which had connected their ancef
tori, with those of the Americans, had been
gradually loqjened to the verge of di/Tolution,
by the ilow but ceaseless hand of" time. Jfa
ftead of returning the Sentiments of f aternal
afFection, which animated-the Americans, they
indulged their vanity with prepoilerous opi
nions of in*ulting superiority : they considered
us, not as fellow-fubje.cts equally entitled with
themselves to every privilege of' Englishmen ;
but as wretched outcalfa, upon whom they
might fafely load the burden, while they re
national grandeur, it has been observed, that
the nations the most highly favoured with
freedom, have not always been the most
friendly to the liberty of others. The people
of Britain, expected to feel none of the op
pression which a parliamentary tyranny might
impose upon the Americans; on the contrary,
they expelled au alleviation of their buulen,
from the accumulation of ours, and vainly
hoped that by the ftvipes inflicted upon us,
their wounds would be healed.
The KingâNeed it be fa id, that he adopt
as the atfVjirtug of hi* own affe&ions, a plan
f<? favorable to the natural propensity of roy
alty towards arbitrary power. Depending
upon the prostituted valour of his mercenary
legions, he was deaf to the complaints, he
was inexorable to tiie remnnftrances of vio
lated freedom. Born and educated tp the
ufuaj prejudices of hereditary dominion, and
habitually accustomed to the syren-song of
adulation, he was ready tp believe what the
courtly tribe about his throne did not fail to
afhire hini; that complaint was nothing more
than the mm mur of {edition,and reiponftrance
the clamour of rebellion.
But they knew net the people with whom
they had to contend. A people, sagacious and
enlightened to discern, cool and deliberate to
difi ufs, firm and resolute to maintain their
rights. From the fitÂ® appearance of the
system of parliamentary opprefflon under the
fo-m of a stamp ast, it wps met, by the de
termined opposition of the whole American
Continent. The annals of other nations have
produced instances of fuccefsful struggles to
break a yoke previously imposed ; but the
records of Hiftoi y did not perhaps furnifli an
example of a people whole penetration had
anticipated the operations of tyranny, and
whose spirit hud diltiained to fuffer an experi
ment upon the ( ir liberties. The ministerial
partizens had flattered themselves with the
expectation that the A& would execute it
feJf; that before the hards of Freedom could
be raised to repel the they would
be loaded with fetters; that the American
Samp Ton would be shorn of his locks while
asleep ; and when thus bereaved of his ftrengjb,
might be made their f'port with impunity,â
Vain illusion !âI; ftantarec us and forcel ; b
as an ejeftrip spark, the fervid spirit of re
finance pervaded every part of the country ;

the system was intended to commerce, it

J pendent States.
An\ericans ! let us pnu/e for a mojnent to
consider the fitnation of our country, at that
eventful day when our national exigence
commenced. In the lull pofTeffion mid en
j joymrnt of all those prerogatives for which
I you then dared to adventure upon 4i ail the
[ varieties of untried betysL't the calm andiet
i tTed moderation of the mind, is scarcely com
j peret)t to conceive the tone of heroism, to
which "the fouls of freemen were exalted in
tliat .hour of perilous magnanimity. Seven
teen times has the fun, in the progress of his
3nn.ua 1 revolutions, diffused his prolific radi
ance over'the plains of Independent America.
Millions of heats which then palpitated' with
the rapturous glow off patriotism, have al
ready been translated t.o brighter worlds ; to
the abodes of m >te tlian mortal freedom.
Other millions have arisen to receive from
t'leir pa-etits and the :neftrma
bie â r<- , compen'e of their archil vements. A
ne-volence is at this moment Kfteinng to the
speaker of the day, like him were at that 1 pe
riod too little advanced beyond the threshold
of life to partake of the divine enthusiasm
which inspired the American bosom ; which
prompted her voi-ce to proclaim defiance !
to the thunders of Britain ; which confccra
ted the banners of the armies ; and finally
ereftfd the holy temple Â«Â»f American Liberty.,
over the tomb of departed tyrapuy. Jt is
f 'om thoG? who have already pasTed the meri
dian of life ; it is from yon, ve vene able af
ferters of the rights of mankind, that we
are to be informed, what were the feelings
which swayed within your breads and impel
led you to action, when, like the {tripling of
IfneaJ, with scarce a weapon to attack, and
without a shield for your defence, you met,
and undismayed, engaged with the gigantic
greatness of the Britifli power. Untutored
in the difgraceful science of human butchery ,;
deftituteof the fatal materials which tfoe in
genuity of man has combined, to sharpen the

mfj you did not hesitate at that moment,
when your coasts vc/c infefi.ed by,a formida
ble fleet, when your territories were invaded
by a numerous ?nd veteran army, to pro
nounce the sentence of eternal feparatinn
from Britain, and to throw the gauntlet at a
power the terror of who'e recent triumphs
was almofi: co extenGve with the earthâThe
Interested and felfifli propensities which in
times of prosperous tranquility have such
powerful.dominion over the heart, were all
expelled, and in their {lead, the public virÂ»
tnes, the spirit of perfwnal devotion to the
common cause. a contempt of every danger
in comparison with the subserviency of the
country, had aflumed an unlimited controul.
The paliion for the public, had -absorbed all
the reft ; as the .glorious Iwminary of heaven
extingu'fbes in a flood of refulgence the twink
ling fpJendo'r of every inferior planet. Thole
of you my countrymen who weie altars ill
those interesting scenes, will bed know, how
feeble, and impotent is the language of this
description to exorefs the impaflioned emo
tions of the foul, with which you wert then
agitated: yet it were injuilice to conclude
from thence, or from the greater prevalence
of private and motives in these days
of calm serenity, that your sons have dege
nerated from the virtues of their fathers.
Let It rather be a fubje6t of pleasing reflexion
to you, that the generous aÂ»d, disinterested
energies, which you were summoned to dis
play, are permitted by the bountiful indul
gence of Heaven to remain latent in the bo
soms of your children. Fro;fl the prefect
prosperous appearance of our public affairs,
Wf may admit a rational hope that our coun
try will have no oecafion to require of us
those exraordinary and heroic exertions which
it was your fortune to exhibit. Eut from
the common versatility of all human destiny,
fliould the profpeft hereafter dofken, and the
clouds of public misfortune thicken to 2 lem
peft ; ibould the voice of our country's ca
lamityever call us to her relief, w swear
by Ihe precious memory of the (ages who
toiled, and of the heroes who bled in her de
fence, that we will prove onrfelves not un
jrbkt&y of the prize, which they so <leaÂ»!y pur
chased â¢ rliat we will ast as the faithful dis
ciples of those who so magnanimously taught
us the inflru&jye leflpn of republican virtue.
Seven years of incfieftual hcftility, an hun
dred millions of treasure frnitlefsly expended,
and uncounted thonfands of human lives fa>
crifjeed to no purpose, at length taught tie
dreadful lesson of v ifdom to tie 13ritifh Go

a which they had long since l>een unab e

volution beai's a different from that
of any civtl C<Wtt?ff, thai had ever ari
sen among men. It was not the convuHive
ftrnggle of tlairftry to throw off the buÂ»den of
accumulated opprefTion but the deliberate,
though enei petic effort of freemen, to repel
the insidious approaches of tyranny. It was
a contest involving the elementary principles
of government, a question of right between
the sovereign and the f'uhjeft which in its prÂ«>-
greflj had a tendency to introduce a:iux: Â£ the
civilized nations of Europe, the difcuÂ£an of
a topic the firft in magnitude, which c<:ti at

cence of a common enmity, was soon si en tb
ened by the bond* of a friendly intercourse,
and the inhjefts of an arbitrary prince, in
fighting the battles of freedom, soon learnt
to cherilh the catife of Liberty itfelf. By a
natural and eafv application to tbetiifelves of
the principles upon which the Americans Â»f
---ferted thejuftice of their warfare, they were
led to inqui-e intothe nature of the obligation
which prescribed their fiibnvflTon to their own
sovereign ; and when they discovered that
the consent of the people is the only legiti
mate sou ce of ?utho iry, they neceifaril/
drew tlie conclusion that their own obedience
was no more than the compujfive acqu'ef
cenre of fervitnde, and they waited only for
a favorable opportunity to recover the pbf
Jeflion of rhofe enjoyments, to which they had
neve? forfeited t;ie right. Sentiments of a
si lilar nature, by a gradual and impercep*

the neceffit-ies of the sovereign reduced li m

this generous donation, all rank's
and denominations have opened
their doors to receive and accom

without money, clothes, or the com

now become a part of our family,
and who we mean to make as com

from the Britilh cruisers, ihouKl be
those who have arrived at Philadel

arrived here, mention their being
boarded by those cruisers, but from
them we have not heard of any
plunderings or insults. As those

The aflertion of a " Jacobin" in
a late Philadelphia paper, that the
President of the United States, i. e.
"the Executive ofthe United Scares"
is preparing " to join the league of
Kings againtt France;" is one of
those barefaced falfehoods which
defeat the intentions of their pro-
mulga.ors : And is a species of am
bitjh insult to the people of the
United States, which none but a
real " Jacobin" could commit. If
we despise the fabricators of such
falfehoods, we ought not neverthe
less to Coffer them to deceive the

cannot be a doubt, but that the citi

The cavalry headed by the brave Chalbos,
and the infaniry ? under my command, did per
form the duties of lepublicans and warriors, by
bravery as well as dignity of behavipur. Dur
ing the a&ion they (hone forth as heroes, but
wfyen viÂ£toi iom, they difpiayed all the virtues
of gtnerous men; their countenance frightened
the enemy so much, that f .hey put more confi
dence in their heels than in the thunders of that
Cod they had injured.
It was noon when the rebels made their ap
pearance. At five o'clock they we e defeated.
We took ten puces of cannon, 4& 8 pounders,
bdidcs 14 to 15 of inferior quality. They weie
so perfectly routed, that they were obliged to
relmquifh their ammunition and ptovifi >Â«i>. â
In a word, the Mod Holy Catholic Holt is re

decay in the Temple of Fame. In lhort,all in

the numbers of the are comparatively

are quelied by the National Militia. The moil

Mr. Ken no,
IT has been repeatedly observed that the
writers a gain it the adminifti ation ot the ge
neral government, are the old inveterate ene
mies of the comlitutioi) lffeif; this obferva
tian will app'y to the whole of that party
perhaps without excepting an individual.âÂ»
It is vain to expert that these persons will
ever be at peace, Â»o long as our country is
free and happy-â ! >ut juttue requires that
thsy ihou-d unim.fk.vi. Reading the New-
Yo k Diary lately, 1 find th& foregoing re
marks corroborated by the peso; maot.e of a
1 itub of the above ant'tfederal junto in the
following qqotationâ-which the reader will
observe amounts to a proportion for dissolv
ing the government of*the union, and revert
ing again to the dangers, imbecility, distress
and contempt of the year 1786âThe wr *er
fays 41 I am firmly of opinio. , that our
security from foreign and domefi c foes, de
pends entirely 011 our Republican habits, and
that the principles of a confederat ion, not. the
absorbing abyis of a monaitluul form, under
the garb of republican i.lm, will keep
us free ; nor is it in the excise lclieir ts < 1 a
financier, or the Pruflun militia plan ot a
Secretary at war : but it is in the virtue, the
knowledge, the liberty, and the courage of
the people, under the State governments, that
\ye are to look for the props of freedom."
