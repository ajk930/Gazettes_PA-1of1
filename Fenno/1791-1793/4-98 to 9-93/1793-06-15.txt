No. IX,
IN the prog' ess of ocietv, the art* naturally
follow agriculture. The. cultivation of
Â»rts and manufactures requires the joint la-
bar and (kiil of many individual. As they
add nothiiiÃ to the productive power of the
focist', th?ydepetid upo" the furphls produce
Â»f the cultivators of the foil for their support.
T ie number of hufbandinen mud become con-
Ittterahle before diftlnft protoiTToni and a divi
fion of labor are neiieflVry. In the early stages
of (bciefey, every family manufactures its own
fceceiTa'us. As society improves and num
bers .uicreafe, a division of employ me nt takes
p} ac â.rtne who is expert in huts,
excNaiges labor with the farmer, and erects
him an habitation \yhile the farmer supplies
him w th sodâanother excels in making
cloathes; he of course becomes theger.eraJ
workman for the focietv. Such we may ima
gine to have been the on gin of every profef
fionâthe habit of attention acquired by con
fhnt exercise in their refpeftive employ
ments, give them a dexterity and' acutenefs
which kept pace with the improvement of
the fwciety. The arts moil neceiTary to fo
cietv, and which are firft cultivated, are fuck
as relate to the preparation and use of foodâ
the materials of cloathingâthe prodn&ion
and use of metals, and the conftruftnon of
proper habitations. A brief detail of these
j<nece(tary for the illustration ot the
The instruments neceflary to facilitate labor
and render the earth proper for tillage, are
numerous and ingenious, and beyond the at
tainment of savages. . The cultivation of
graia alf(Vrdqitires long experience and much
observation to bringit to perfectionâthe art
of reducing grain to flour, tins again to
btead, isjlowjy acquired; and the latter must
have cost the experience of ages. Some na
tions at'prefent are not acquainted with the
art of fermenting their paste.
ous liquors also require much experience, and
many rude efTays mud have been made to
render them in any degree palatable. Gar
dening; and the-cultivation and improvement
Â©P plants and fees, are in like manner of dift
ficidt diCcovery, and remote from the obfer
yat'on of savages.
The r e arts ari r e immediately from the cul
tivation of the foil, and a : e neceflary in a
greater or less degree to the infancy of civil
fbciety.
As fofirr as men proceed beyond the savage
ftate v they for foaiething different from
the of* beads? for defence or ornament.
Eve y step in the art of cloathing is difficult
so a lavageâthe raifi.ig of the flax and woolâ
the* means of converting fhefe into' thread
and yarn, and the inmvmerab'e gradations in
the procePv of manufaduring these into cloth,
inquire long attention and much ingenuity*
The use of metal* also is of great service
in tfte early stages of society, and greatly ac
eel<* r 3tes the progrefe of refinement; the
methods of procuring them are however dif
ficult, and in a mea'ure unknown to men in
the firft period of society. The d'fcovery of
the oreâthe means of extra&ing, refining
andfoging itâthe ait of erecting furrracesâ
Â«f procuring fuel, and of contriving machine
ry for the abridgement of tailorâthe art of
tem Â»erUig the metalâthe fibricalion of in-
a id indeed the w.hole prucefi of
the work, requires much trnc, much-
tion % and muc'i exper ence, to bring them to
any degree of perfection.
The art of con ft rusting habitations for use
â¦r elegance, is a primary ol>je<st of atrention
ki the ea l : eft period of society. Atfirft, like
all othe arts, it mud have been extremely
Tude. The felling of the timber, the contriv
ing and trdjufting the proportion*:, the tools
proper for these purposes, and the whole that
relates to to pa ntingand ornament,
are difficult and imperfect, while the arts of
civilized life are unknown.
Att these arts are neceiTary to the full efta
blilhment of civil societyâ-they are however
â¢f difficult invention and flow progress, wtwn
4eft wholly to the rude efforts of uninftrufted
genius.
â  Inexperience, ages elap r ed before they ar
rived at any cimfiderable pe'feftion.âThefie
arts we have it in ou r power to communicate
tntb* savages ; and by being early introduced
among them, would contribute greatly to their
Advancement towards poMhed manners.
These are the means which appear to me
noli proper to bs employed to bring the In
dians t* tHe knowledge and enjoyment of the
fcteffiwgs of civilization.
Let a plan be contrived that will embrace
the whole of these objectsâTo inftruft them
fci 'elisionâto regulate the inllitution of
marriageâto introduce the notion of private
property, of a fixed residence and agricul
ture*âto furnifli them with the instruments
of art, and to inftruA them in such as arc
">o4 aeceXuy to the iufmcy of foeiety.

Bitf v .this fva&ice, however good the de
sign with which it wcs was found,
to be attended with Tome inconveniences.
Thecolle&ion of so* many petty fines was
both trouHlefome and* degrading to the Pro-.
felFors. Neither, after all, could the iropo
fition of thcfe fines be expected to pr oduce
the desired efFect : for, if coni'de* able* they'
operated rather as a tax upon the parents,
than as punifliment on the boys; and, it in
con tide rabie, were but too apt to be dif:e

the infl.tflion of it so frequently, and in so

When the Duke of York failed
for Holland, his orders were to re
main at a fniall diliance from the
place of landing, to obfeive the mo
tions of the Dutch. If they did not
(hew ttrong fyniptoms of vigour and
resolution, it was nor judged expe
dient to risk the facritiee of the
(guards to the defence of an ally,
who were fufpetfted of inactivity in
(heir own cause. On a sagacious
enquiry, the Duke found that Dort
had scarcely 200 men to defend it.
He concluded, that if WilliamftaJt
surrendered, the former could not
prevent, in its weak state of de
fe nee, the enemy from marching to
Rotterdam. Using, therefore, adi f
cretion in whicl), perhaps, the fare
of Holland depended, he marched
to garrison Dort ; a mealure which
inlpired the gallant defenders of

effect on the councils and conduct
of the Dutch.

HAVING obtaiped a copy of the circular
letter from I "the'departirfetit of the Treafuiv,
refpecfing the (hips of war and privateers of
France, I.fend it to you for. publicationâ By
giving it a place in your paper, you will -pro
bably prevent much raifconceptipn and mif
reprefentaifion. I must confefs that* I feel no
small degree of indignation to tee many peo
ple wantonly cenf'uring the conduct of the
Executive in this instance, being at the tame
tinte'fcotirely unacquainted with every cir*
cujnftance that gave i ife to it, and of every
prijiciple upon which it is jultifiable. They
arg eternally insisting upon-a ft rift neutrality,
â¦ntfappear to poilefs no definite conceptions
of'tTie true meaning of the term. Would it
be an obfei vance of the principle of neutra
lity, with reipeft to France, to diflegard a
treaty at the very firft occasion which could
polfibly demand an observance of it? If
France had never been engaged in war, the
17th end 22d articles would have beenjife
lefs. But as the period has arrived, which
calls for the execution of the engagements
ltipu'ated in those articles, would it not a
mount to an unequivocal declaration of War
with France, to rejirft the validity of them.
I tiling it would be proper to publiih the
two articles in questionâAster which I shall
be much surprized to lee one man of solid.un
derstanding disapproving of a rigid adherence
to thein 00 the part of America. A.B.

Si*,
IT being the opinion- of the executive, that
there is no geoeral law of tbe land, prohibit
ing the entry and sale of goorfs captured by
foreigri powfers at warâand consequently tbat
such entry and sale are lawful; except in
cales where a prohibition is to be found in
the treaties of the United Statesâ
It becomes the duty of this Department to
make known to you, that the entry of veflels
captured and brought into our ports by the
ships ot war and privateers of France, and of
their cargoes, is to be received in the fame
manner, under the fame regulations,and upon
the lame conditions, as that of veflels and
their cargoes which are not prizesâOne of
thefa conditions is, of course, the payment or
securing the payment of the duties'impoled
by law on goodi, wares and merchandile im
ported, and on the tonnage of ships and vef
lels.
But the fame privilege will not extend to

Norfolk, jnnc 5
At a meeting of the (landing committee of the
Republican Socjbtv of Norfolk and Pojif
niouth, on thegrl 0 f June, 1793,
Resolved, That it is the opinion of this
Committee, ihat the Declaration, compri
lng an expofiuonof the- fetilimrnts and princi
ples upon which this Society has been formed,
be published the Norfolk Papers.
DECLARATION.
WE, the under fig ned citizens, declare as
our Unalterable opinion", that the bleffmgs of a
jun, nv.ld, and equitable government can only
be perpetuated by that puiefpirit of Republican
vigilance to which (under favor of the Supreme
Governor of the Universe) we owe our prcfent
political ease, tranquility and happiness.
" That l^e inattention which manv of our
fellow-citizens discover towards the deareit
rights, privileges and immunities of freemen, is
to us matter of serious concern and regret.
" 1 hat the exccllenre of a mild representa
tive government (affording an examph of the
happiness of equal liberty) will excite jealoufics
in the minds, and be painful inthe fight of ty
rants and their abettors : it does therefore be
hove men, who ate experiencing the blcfling* of
freedom, to be ever on the watch to guaid a
gaii.ft the machinations of those enemies to man
kind.'
" That the imaginary fecu'rity into which
we have been lulled, by our remote fmiation
trom the combined del'pois of Europe,' and
other conji derations, may havq the mod fatal ten
dency ; il not to eieilroy our independence as a
nation, at lead to sap the foundation of that glo
nous fabric upon which our liberties reft
our free and excellent conjlitution.
" That it becomes Republicans at all times
to Ipeak their fentimenu freely and without re
fcrve ; but more particularly at this alarming
pci iod when we behold the Tyrants of the world
combined, and every engine of despotism em
ployed in making a grand effort to crush the
infant spirit of Ireedom, recognized by our
brethren of Fiinee; whose virtuous exertions
(in a caute so lately our own) we cannot a* men,
and as Republicans, behold with ind ffe/encr,
or contemplate without a mixiure of sympathy
and admiration.
"That it is a truth, not less notorious than it
is to be lamented, that in the bosom of our
cournry we have men whose principles and fen-
timents are opposed to all free governments,
and that such are juÂ£l objeÂ£ls of suspicion.
" That ltrongly impressed with these fer.ti
menti, we have conceived it to be our interejl,
but more particularly our duty, to lorm this
AfTociarion, for the puipofe of ftrengthcmng
the bands of Union, and of cherishing republi
can feniiments, manners, morals .and affec
tions."
