Mr. Russell,
Â» TT has been enquired by citizens anxions
A for the welfare of the country, and aware
of the distress to which it must inevitably be
Teduced by a European war, whethev we
have not already pledged our faith so far as
to preclude us from any present contfderatlpii
of convenience or inconvenience, and whe
ther we are not by oar own voluntary en
gagement bound to take the part of the pre
sent government Â»n in cafe
the Weft-India iftaild > be attacked bv
Great-Britain.
By the eleventh article of the Treaty of
Alliance with France, the United States
U ' guaranty to his Most Christian Majesty, the
pofleffions of the crown of France in Ame
rica."âBut the course of human events has
either totally absolved us, or at least suspend
ed the obligation of this- clause, and it can
not be made even a plausible pretext for. in
volving us in the present war. My reasons
for this opinion are,
1. That the guaranty is te kh most Christian
Majesty, or the poffejfiffls of the crown of France.-â
I ask, who is at this time his moji Chnflian Ma
jesty ? A part of the French nation, and all
the other powers of Europe will answer, he
is the son or the'brother of the late Lours
theXVlth. The National Convention, and
the present Republic of France will fay there
is no such man. The office and all its powers
have been extinguished in the blood of the
person wfah whom your contrad: was made.
If the article "binds us to either of the par
ties, the question, which of the two is en
titled to claim the performance, is now a
audition to be fettled by the event of a civil
War, and neither party can call upon us to
dccide it for them. â¢
2. That supposing the revolutions of France,
are now completed, and a Republic firmly
established, it may be doubtful, whether they
have not by their change of government, dif
"fofved this clause of the Treaty : I know it
is a general principle of the laws of nations,
that the rights and obligations of Treaties
survive the internal revolutions,of govern
ment, and therefore that the, Republic of
France may be entitled to the benchr; of en
contracted with the former mo
narch. But to this rule there are many ex
ceptions ; the firft Constituent- Aifembly were
so fully of this opinion that they thought the
nation absolved from all such Treaties pre
yioufly made, as might be injurious to their
iqterefh, and the present government have
extended the principle much further,when as a
juftification for opening, the Scheldt, contra
ry to the positive and express flipulation of
many Treaties, they have formally denied
the obligation of any compa& t/ which was
contrary to the natural Rights of Men. Upon fpe-
principles it maybe very question
able how far the sovereign controul of a
French Republic, over illands at three thou
sand miles distance from them is confident
with such natural rights, and it would be dif
ficult to mark the diftin&ion which should
prohibit every art of jurifdi<slion exercised by
one nation over a river flowing through the
territories of another, and at the fame time
allow a supreme authority over'colonies pla
ced by the hand of nature at so wide a dis
tance from the metropolis.-âThe pofjejjior.i of
the crQTua qJ France, as guaranteed by our Trea
ty to his moji hrijlian M(ije[ly i appear to me to
have formed a part of that Constitution of
g jvernment which then existed in France;
tney were a part of the monarchy, and under
tae new government they can .no longer be
confiJered as pojfeffiem, in the fame sense in
which they were understood when the Uni
lep States bound themselves to the guaranty.
. 3* Should both these grounds for the opin
ion I am supporting be considered as errone
ousj and the clause in quefHon be held as
binding us to the French Republic, in the
fame manner as it formerly did to the Kinp,
it remains to enquire what was intended by
the guaranty and what are the duties which
it has prescribed to us IâDuring the admin
ift rat ion of the royal \ ..-rnmÂ«ot, had the
authority of the Covert Â»â¢ â¢ Â»en guided by the
maxims of speculative freedom or of prac
tical tyranny; had he provoked a rebellion in
the by opprefling the planters or by
liberating their slaves; the guaranty in the
treaty would not have bound us to assist him
v/.th our blood and treafuies, in enforcing an
abfund and unnatural Government against the
perpetu-tl refinances which it would necefTarj
jy provoke." Had the late King of France,
like other Kings of whom we read in "history,
veiling his insatiate ambition, under Anne
ipecious pretence of glory, of* dignity or of
Safety, declared a wanton and uujuftifiaWe
\%ar against any or all of the commercial na
tions in Europe, and had his pofleffions in
America been conquered by his enemies in
the course of such a war, "he never could have
called upon the United States by virtue of
â this guaranty, to repair the injuries of his
folly, and to tecrifice themselves in support of

his DlÃiwms project*. Ft is tinnecefTary to
f&tigu? the public with the pedantry of quota
tions the write nrupon natural and po
litical Law, but it may he laid down as 3,11
unive-ffal principle, that no ftipuiation con
tained infc treaty, can ever oblige one nation
.to adopt or support the folly or injustice of
another.âln applying this principle, it be
come* neceflary to observe, that the adniin
iftrat'on of the French government over their
'colonies, since the firft revolution of 1789
has been tisch as to keep almost all their
islands in a con it ant (fate of rebellion and ci
vil War ; hy the forjiifr; of these calamities
the slaves have been united against m.as-
; by the latter the mailers have been di
vided against each other. From the chaotic
mass of hum art passions, a polle&ion of all the
most violent and inflammable elements has
been fele&ed and combined together ; the
torch of the furies has been applied to the
com portion j and the miserable illanders have
been the v;iftims of the fatal cxplofion.
To such a state of desperation have these
devoted colonies been reduced, that a for-
mal deputation as we are informed by the
public papers have solicited for them the
prote<ftion ot'tiie Bii'ifli government; and'
we are now told that this protection ha< been
promised ; that the King of Great-Britain,
has agreed to take poifelfion of these colo
nies and to hold them in trull for his Mqfi
Christian Majefly, the power to whom the letter
of our guaranty has promised the afTiftance
of the United States. An arbitrary and op
pre/five system ofadminjftration compelled us
to renounce the authority of Great-Britain,
and France aflifted us to maintain our honor
able warfare. A similar evil, has driven
some of the French colonies to a similar re
medy; one of them has even attempted a
Declaration of Independence, and all the o
thers would doubtless ,have done the fame,
Were they not profoundly fenlible that the
tims is not yet come, for the Lion to lie down
with the Lamb, and that the justice of their
cause would avail them but little against the
powerful injustice of tlieir oppreflors. But
fuiely there would be fomethipg iingularlv,
and iniquitous, to fee the United States
support the French in a plan of oppreflive ad
ministration over their colonies, as a reward,
for refctiing them from the oppreflion of
Great-Britaiu. It would hg fucli a
vierfion of all moral and political consistency,
such a covenant between virtue and vice,
such a coalition of liberal freedom with des
potic tyranny, as can scarcely be imagined
without a confufion of or expressed
without an abfurd'rty of language.
4- The last ground ijpop which I. consider
this guaranty as dissolved or at least suspend
ed? is, that by the att of the French govern
ment, it has been rendered impracticable.
They have declared war against all Hie naval
powers of Europe. "What the event of that
war will be, it is not given to man tofpretjel;
but we cannot take a part with the French
Republic, without uniting all the reft of Eu
rope against us ; which upon every lational
calculation of probability, would be dooming
oarfelves to inevitable ruin and deftru&ion.
We are therefore commanded by a Jaw,
which fupercede* all others, by that uncon
troulable law of nature, which is paramount
to all humap legislation, or compact, to re
main at peace, and to content ourselves with
wishing that laureled victory may fit upon
the sword of justice, and that Crnooth success
may always be strewed before the feet of vir
tuous Freedom. MARCELLU S.

" "TAR from faying to . people that nature
X has made all men e<]ual, they ought to
learn on the contrary, that (he has made them
very unequal; that one is born strong and
another weak j that one is born healthy and
another infirm ; that allarenotequaHyadroit
Â«nd vigilant, and thus the mailer piece of
well regulated society is to render equal by
laws, those whom nature has made so unequal
as to their ineans. By nutuia! equality, we
understand an equality as .to rights, and not
an equality in fact ( since it is true that men
are born with unequal means, and pass their
lives in conditions very unequal whatever li
berty the country to which they belong may
polTefs. A Shoemaker of ancient Rome was
not the equal of Scipio, although he had na
turally as much right as Scipio to be elected
to offices ia the Republic; they were both
equal as to their rights, but unequal as to
their means. It would be better, perhaps, to
adopt the expreflion of civil equality, since all
the citizens are profeifted by equal laws
There is not, and .there never will be any
other equality among men.
ALL wife Legislators have added to the
obligation of laws the ties of religion. Thev
thought that they could rot take too many
precautions to establish among men subordi

But the philosophers of the present day, build
their republics like Plato upon a Hem theory.

They have :n their imaginations an itWal
world, which they wish tp-ftibftitute for that
which really exiits.
TRUE Courage has always confifled in
boldly speaking against arbitrary power, whe
ther of the Prince or .of .the People. It is
when every body is awed to Jilence in the pre
sence ot a Despotâ-it Is. in the midst of Slavery
a man ought to elevate hiÂ§ voice in fa
vor of Liberty; but when a furious multitude
all pu'rfiUng this fame liberty, and marking
their fodtfteps with blood rises, it is then ne
celTary to fofren the voice, and to speak dis
creetly in favor of government, without
which thpre is no liberty. In one word, cou
rage at jfueh a time confills in maintaining
moderately our opinions, as it before consisted
in boldly exprefftng them. The arbitrary
power of an individual is defpotifmâÂ»that of
many is Anarchy. Nothing is more frequent
than to.find men of honor, who pride them
selves in oppoling the arbitrary authority of
an individual: But before the power of a
multitude every thing yields in a moment,
and we obey without blulhingv In Short, it'
requires the most fub'ime courage ndt to"
flatter tfce pafHons of the people.
IF there existed on earth a race of beings
superior to man, they would Come times be
acton i Hied at our inftin&iâbut would laugh at
our reafoiiâAbove al/, in the great Events of
this world, our heft efforts betraying so much
imbecility and our projects accompanied.with
so little fmefight, would excite their pity.
Human vanity must confefs that there exists
a kind of fatality which Seems to amuse itfelf
in giving the l.e to our prudence* and at its
pleafureTjaffles the councils of wisdom. It is
to the jhprtnefs ofVour views, we muft.attri
b.ute this, If we. could .find out.caufi?s bef9re
we were, alarmed by their effects, we could
predict events with ibme certaintyâbut al

trembling for the future.
BY a Constitution we combi

when the three powers are combined.for. the

these powers are confounded or are nnited in

Mr. Russell,
IT is with much pleasure I have observed
in a perusal of Paris papers, as late as the
16th March, that a great degree of peace and
order appeared to exist in that populous ca-r
pital. 1 obfer-ved-, in a paper of the that
fps Theatres were advertised as open on that
evening for public exhibitions.; and I think
the following diary of the business done in
the Commune of Paris, no bad index of the
tranquillity of the city, viz.

tion was bloody ; our troops loft
260 soldiers ; Major Strafaldo was
wounded ; two captains and two
lieutenants were made prisoners by
the enemy.
This defeat is to be attributed to
the Piedmontefe, who having fled
at the commencement of the battle,
drew the Auftrians after them. The
loss would have been greater, if the

Of the dispositions made by Lord

it has only transpired, that he has

one thousand pound per year. Of
the former font 20001. were to be
paid immediately after his decease.
To his own man, ââ Douey, his

a year. The other fervaius of his
household have a liberal provilion.
The remainder of his fortune de

FROM THEr VIRGINIA HERALD.
THE present situation of the United States in
refpeft to the nations of Europe, having
been anticipated in a prophetic speech of a re
fpe&able% member of the Convention oi this
State, when the constitution of the federal go
vernment was under consideration, it may not
be without its use to recur to an argument which
then had weight in the determination of an im
portant question. The firfl and second fe&ions
of the new constitution were under considera
tion. They involved the fubjeft of direst taxa
iion x and it was objetted that the exercise of such
a power, by the general government, was unne
eejfary% impracticable, and uvfuje. In answer to
ihtjirjl obje&ion, Mu JVhvui sÂ° N said, " I beg,
gentlemen, to consider the situation of this coun
try, if unhappily the government were to be de
prived ,ot this power. I lhall not review that
eoncourfe of dangers, which may probably arise
at remote periods of futurity, nor all those
which we have immediately to apprehend ; but
I will mention one Tingle consideration, drawn,
from faÂ£l itfelf. I hope to have your attention.
By the treaty between the United States and his
Most Christian Maj'. sty, among other things it is
Aipulated', that thegieat pnnciple.on which the
armed neutrality in Europe was founded, (hould
prevail in cafe of juturr. wars. The principle is
this, that free lhips lhall make free goods, and
thatv<(fels and goods shall be free fiom con
denjaaiiq/). .Gnat-Britain did ant recognize
it*âwhile all Europe was against her, (be held
out without acceding to it. It has been consi
dered for some time pafl, that the flames of war,
already kindled, woujd spread, and that France
and England were likely to draw those swords,
which were so recently put up. This is judged
probable. We should not be surprised in a
Ihort time to consider ourfelvej as a neutral na
tionâFrance on one fide, and Great-Britain on
the other.
M What is the situation of America ? She is
remote from Europe, and ought not to engage in
their politics or wars.
+' The American veflels, if they can do it with
advantage, may carry on the commerce of the
contending nations. It is a fourcc of wealth,
â which we not to deny to our citizens.
But, Sir, is there not infinite danger, that in de
spite of ail our caution, we should be drawn
into the war ? If American vcffels have Fench
property on board, Great-Britain wÂ»ll seize
them. By this means we shall be obliged to
relinquish the advantage of a neutral nation, or
be engaged in a war. A neutral nation ought to
be Â»e<pc&able, or elffi it will be insulted and at
tacked. America, in her present important
fituatvon, would run thr v ifque of being drawn
in aÂ« a party, and lose advantage of being
neutral. Should it happen that the Britilh fleet
(hould be superior, have we not reason to con
clude, from the spirit displayed by that nation
to us, and to all the world, that we (bould be
insulted in our own ports, and our vcffels seized ?
But if we be in a rcfpeflable fituation âif it be
known that oar govei*nment can command the whole
refaurces oj the Union, we (hall he fuftered to en
joy the great ad vantages of carrying on the com.
merce of the nations at war; for none of them
would choose to add U.S. to the numbir of
their enemies."
Every one knows that the power contended
for, was tepofed in the general government.
Evav one knows that the filtration of this coun
try, predicted in the argument, and the war an
ticipated by the speaker, have occurred ; and
every one ought to know, that it is the true in
terest of the United Spates, to obf?rve a ftri&
neutrality. What American then will be so
imprudent* as (Irom-motives of precarious profit
to himfclf) to jeopardifc the peace and profpe
fity of his country, hv any ast which may bring
into suspicion the fmcerijy of the difpnfjtion of
the general .government, ss declared in the Pre
fiden.'s Pioclamation ? Patriots will abhor
such a condutt. But ii is not enough that ihey
restrain only themfclves from political iniquity ;
oor country abounds in fourccs of fucccffful
f peculation, and fwtndlers of rvery cast, as well
natives as fortifners, arc multiplied among us.
The most lac red obligations aic not fufficient
a; ways to repel the power of avatire : It is there
lore necessary that the eye of vigilance fhnuld
be abioad, to difcriromate those who dare,
in coriirjnpt-of constitutional authority, to vio
lace the (aw of nation*.

Philadelphia, May 25.
i 6 Within tliefe last three weeks the Auf
trianshave had the advantage in four anions ;
the French fought gallantly under Dumourie-,
but were obliged to quit their ground, altho'
much fnperior in number, and are quitting
almost every place they had,gained polTeHlon
of. Li?ge, Bruflels, Oftend,

Our fleets are in high condition, some already
at sea, and others quite ready. The loss we
have sustained at sea from their declaration
of war eight days previous to our knowing
their intentions, and commencing hostilities
in consequence, has been trivial indeed, not
one sixth what our merchants were apprehen
fiveof; this is owing to the greatest exer
.tions in the naval department, the coafl of
France being literally covered with our fri
gates ami fioops of war ; so that if by chance
any of our trade is picked up, before they get
into a French port they are frequently re
captured, and not uncommonly The captor
also. At the instant lam writing, there ift no
communication whatever with France, it is
ten days since we have deceived the least in
formation from Paris ; without being the least
sanguine, I may fay that all things, as far as
human forefight goes, seem returning to a
renovation of the former system, but with at
tention to the lower orders of the people, who
will f om the interference of this country, be
relieved from many impositions."
By account? from Ireland, per the Ann and
Mary, it appears that the government have
put a flop to the emigration of redemptioners
from the north of Ireland. None, therefore,
but persons of property, who may be able to
advance the pafl'age money for themselves
and families, can attempt coming to the
United States, and even tliofe find an almost
insurmountable difficulty in difpoflng of their
propertyâso that the people of Ireland feein
to be in a manner completely imprisoned, and
obliged to remain under their present yoke.
This, however, they do not so much complain
of, as that of being difarmedâ r though this has
not yet been complied with by the northern
volunteers.
Napper Tandy, who was charged with be

however, he declined, not expe&ing much
fair play from the laws now dictated by the
executive ; and, in consequence, he has made
a retreat to France, as is generally fuppo'ed ;
from whence, it was thought, he would loon
set out on a visit to the United States.

Caps. Samuel Briard arrived here last evening
from Tobago, which he left the 21ft April, and
informs, thdt the islands of Sr. Chrillopher,Gre

A merchant of this city, has received let

The following particulars, from the Gene
ral Advertiser, are colle&ed from
on board the brig Sally, from Cape-Francois :
Dumourier really went over to the Auftri
ans some time in the of April. He
tampered firft with the old commillioners to
Belgia; informed them that he row found
Frenchmen unmanageable under a republic,
and that they required all the rigour of mo
narchical energy to keep them in a proper
degree of subordination. He next communi
cated his change of sentiment to the Conven
tion by letter, (who probably received the in
formation from the commillioners as Toon at
least) and explicitly declared to them that
France mult â have a King.
The paflertgers in the Sally, do not appear
acquainted with the circumstance of commif
-fiiMiecs being dispatched by the Convention to
apprehend him ; but mention, that Beurnon

Ui. JEFFERSON-
Boftua
.t per Cftxt. act v,OBSERVATION S
oo the newly propoftd
CONSTITUTION OK FRANCE.
(from an F.nglijh publication )
THE constitution which has been
framed by the committee ap
pointed for that purpose, has been
treated with difrefpedl, and appears
to be Unking into oblivion. Like
every other scheme which tbiFrench
Legillators have prefemed to their
country, it may please the isolated
observer in his closet, but poflefles
no cementing bond to unite the dis
cordant man! pf human opinion,
prejudice, and pailion. JneftabliÂ£h
ing an ideal equality, it gives a de
cided superiority to presumptuous
â¢vice over onafluming integrity ; in
providing for the poor, it tramples
on the rights of the richer clafi'es of
society, and in endeavoring to check
the excefles of arbitrary power,
bursts the bands, of subordination,
and prevents the operation of legis
lative enactments. The organiza
tion of the executive council is in
judicious, and the method of its ap
pointment almost iinpratficable. It
is perhaps one of the most difficult
political problems to ascertain the
modeof veiling a competent portion
of efficient authority in a particular
body, without infringing upon ge
neral freedom. In some countries
it has been effected by creating va
rious artificial ranks in the commu
nity, which inspire submission with
out injuring liberty, and command
refpetft without requiring servility.
As the condiment assembly in the
firft inllance, and the national con
vention in imitation of their exam
ple, refufed to adopt'any projedt of
this natureâit only remained for
them, by imprefling on the minds of
their fellow citizens the clearest pre
ceptions of moral beauty and defor
mity, to denionftratetheneceffity of
Submitting to the laws, and to dis
play the advantages resulting from
obedience.
Inltead, however, of purfuingthis
course, the unbridled licentiousness
of character which pervades ihe ma
jority of the convention, and the
captious jealousy it has entertained
of ministers, nominated by itselF,
mull have difleminated among the
people of France, the opinion that
exemption from all restraint is hap
piness, andtopunifh those who dare
to impose it, is virtue. Another
fundamental error in this plan is the
facility with which it may be alter
ed : the formers of this conftituti
enal code were probably unwilling
to risk the perpetual felicity of their
republic on the ifl'ue of an untried
speculation, and have therefore
delegated to its inhabitants the pow
er of calling a national convention,
in virtue of certain privileges deno
minated rights of cenforlhip ; and
likewise imposed it upon the legis
lative body as an absolute duty, as
ter aoyears to summon a convention
to amend the constitution. Accord
ing to these provisions, the intrinsic
excellence of a government is to be
estimated according to the ease with
which it may be changed r nothing
which is permanent can be ufeful ;
and the reason, philolophy, and
rights, which at present illuminate
the world, are the fleeting ephe
mera of the dayâwhich fluttering
for a moment before the merjdiau
fun, but fink with the (hades of even
ing into forgetfulnef9 and annihila
tion.

added to this edition, exclusive of those in the
lali London edition.
That no disappointment may arifc from sub
scribers expelling what the publisher neither
promises nor is able to perform, far gives this
early and explicit notice, that of feme of the
States it will be impoflible for him to'give maos
fully accurate, no late surveys having been made ;
and it is hardly neceflary to obrferve, that it falls
not within his plan to go to the exprnfe of sur
veys. But in every instance; he will avail hiin
felf of the bejl materials 'extant: And such cor
refttons and additions as his utinoft exertions
can procure, (halite made.
II I. The geography of the United States is un
dertaken by gentlemen of literary abilities,
who have engaged to give a more full and fa
tisfaffory account of it than any ever publifti
cd. ft will extend to 250 or 300 pages, al
though in the Britifli edition, and even in
that of 1752, it makes only about 30.
IV. Should the work exceed for.y-eight num
bers, the surplus will be delivered gratis to
the fubferibers.
V. The price of each number will be a quarter
dollar, to be paid on delivery.
VI. Such fubferibers as do not choose to receive
the work in numbers, arc to pay three dol
lars at the time of fubferibing.
Thfe printer, anxious to render this work, as
perfect as the nature of it will allow, mod ear
nestly requt ftÂ«, that such gentlemen, throughout
the United States, as have it in their power, will
fijrnifh him with documents for eorre&irig the
past errors in the geography of America, and
for furniftiing a more complete system ot geo
graphy than has yet appeared.
The title page, lift of fnbfcribti Ynamcs, with
the account of the Newtonian system, See. See.
will be given in the 47th and numbers.
iSI. B. The fubferibers, and the public in ge
neral are requeued to consider the following ve
ry material circumftanccâThe London quarto

412
it contains only ej m*ps an* plate*, Â«r.* of the
GcoÂ«rÂ»phy of ibe Uoitrd Slates, as has been ob
served a bore, only' about 30 pagesâwhereas,
Carry's edition will contain 41 mapsaud placet,
aud have 1 wo hundred pages of letter prefe more.
And it need not be observed, that tbe fcventeeo
maps 10 be added, are of more ltnportante to
Americans by far, than riie 25 London ones.
The observation will apply Â«'i h equal force to
the letter prcfs additions.
The maps will be publiflwd in such order of
fuccefli.m as ihey are engraved, and dire&ions
will be primed for the proper rtunoer of pla

At a meeting of the School Committee*
February sth; 1793.
The Committee, appointed to examine M The
Preceptor's Afliftant, or Student's Guide," being
a systematical treatise of Arithmetic, by John
Vt nal 1, teacher of the Mathematics & Writ
ing, in Bolton, reported, that they have attended
that service, and are of opinion, that the work
is executed with judgment, and is as well calcu
lated for the use of schools, counting houses, and
private families, as any of the fame compass
that has hitherto been offered to the public.
Voted, That the above report be accepted*
and that Mr. Vinali be furnilhcd with a copy
of it, whenever he (hall desire it.

CHARLES BULFINCH, Sec'rv.
The following charadler of the above work,
is given in the Review of the MaJ'achvJetti Ma
gazine, for Jan. 1793 :
" This is a very ufeful work, and is no ill
proof of thejudgment and industry of the author.
The rules are laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are fufficient for their il
lustration. One part ol the work deserves par
ticular commendat-ion. We mean that which
the author fliles " Mercantile Arithmetic." It
occupies a conliderable portion of his book, but
not more than its importance will jullify. We
would recommend to ihe young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to this branch.
He will find its principles well explained And
should he make himfelf matter of'them, he will
always have reafoÃ to acknowledge his obliga
tion to the judicious and laborious author. We
cannot but congratulate the rifntg generation on
account of the many ufeful productions which
have lately appeared ; and In which their im
provement has been principally consulted.
Among those productions we must place this
treatise of Arithmetic. We should be wanting
in justice to the author, [hould we not acknow
ledge that his work is in reality that which its
title importsâThe Pr ecevtor's Assistant,
or Student's Guide."

THE Author is sensible that the firft edition
of his American Geography (which makes Pait
I. of the above work) was irt many inftanccs dt
fe&ive, in others erroneous, and in fomeoffen
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was his
desire, in the preffnt edition, to fupplv the defi
ciencies, correct the errors, and meliorate the
ofFcnfive pans of the last. To aflift him in this
business, he has received many valuable commu
nications from the heads of 'departments in the
general government, and from gentlemen of re
fpc6bbility in the several Hates. Thedefcrip
tion of foreign countries (which composes Pait
11. of the above work) has been carefully com
piled from the most approved writers on Geo
graphy, and ufeful information introduced from
the difcovcries of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and rcfpc&ablc authors. Indeed, no paini
nor expense have been spared to render this woik
the most complete, accurate, and ufeful of any
ever offered to the public.
