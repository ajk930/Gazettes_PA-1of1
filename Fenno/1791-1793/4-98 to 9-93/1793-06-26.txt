Skcfch of the Pleadings in this important cafe,
continued.
JirVE I 4 th, P. M.
MR. KAWLE, as counsel for the libej
lants role. He laid a few words on the
importance of the caule. He next remarked,
that America had received efTential alliftance
from France, in a mod important moment,
owed to that alliftance, in a great ntea~
liire her liberty and a&ual confeouent pros
perity, (he can but be grateful; but he ob
served, a judge always decides on the merits
of a cause abftraftedly, the situation of parties
have no influence upon his decision. The
tyiellion is not in the present instance to avsid
or dispute the obligation of a treaty but to
fee whether the present cafe applied to any of
the provisions of the treaty.
He read the libel, the plea and replication,
the substance of which we have stated at the
head of this argument, to explain on what
grnnnrl rhe present controversy rests. The
plea he obfeived admits the facts in the libel
to be true, it was only contended that the
court could not maintain the prelent suit
Ho hoped to be eftablilli, that the suit
could properly be brought before this court,
agreeably to the law of nations and not con
trary to treaties.
He laid down the following points.
1. T'lat every foyereign nation may âindi
eate a wrong done to itfelf;
2. That in the present cafe a wrong is done
to this nation ;
3- That it may be vindicated by the na
tion.
His next object would be to (hew.
I. That this vindication may be effected
leveial waysj; one of which by the interposi
tion of the judicial authority of the neutral
Jtrirf injured roiin*>-
â * **seTlFis judicial interposition is law
ful unle's prohibited by express treaty and
that no treaties to prevent it now exist*.
To begin by the firft position. He Ciould
take no time to (how that the United Scates
are a fiivereign nation. By the law of na
tions li-lfprelervatton is the duty of every so
vereign, tlie right to protest itfeif from inju
ry ir, a neceflary conlequence flowing from
that duty. To prove this point he cited the
fallowing authorities : I. Vat. eh. 2. fee. 16 ;
K. Vat. eh. 4. fee. 49 ; alCo ch. 5. fee. 65, 66.
Other authorities ceuid be urought but theft
ivijl fuffice.
He next went to the second point, and firft
mentioned that we have treaties of amity
and commerce with Spain and Holland, and
though unconnected in this refpetf: with Great-
Britain, vet we are in a state of neutrality as
relates to them, and confcrjently bou&d by
the law ot nations not to injure Asa
neutral nation we ought to b<*'"sve impartial
ly towards belligerent powers as far as con
fiil'unt with noting tieaties. He la d it
'A"; *- * general rule, that the territory
Â»Â»it!)in the jurifdidtion of a neutral country
â¢aotild afford a fafe asylum to all belligerent
powers.
3 V at. Sic. 105 gives an instance in point. J
Tne Bute?) fieet wefi Bergen by
the >nt. The of the forts in
Vi'vflication ifi the right of neutralit", thtfi
violated, fired on the EugliJh fleet, and the
proceeding was certainly juftifiable by the
principles of the law of nations.
â Vattcl fays, that prizes may be brought in
to neutral ports ; but not taken within neu-
jurisdiction as that tends to involve the
.Count yâLeeM. 9 page i2latid 2 Woodi
ftmpagt 143, Cay, that vessels cannot lawful
ly be captured in peutral ports or places, or
*vithm cannon-shot of forts.
For this right ot neutral nations we are
-not indebted to treaties, the right is prior to
treaties, efl.-ntial to the existence of foverelgn
nations and derived from the inherent duty
0! prtfervatior, it is of the highest impor
tance and ihould be jealously preser ved from
infringement. It bad been !aid on the part
o the captors, by Mr. Duponceau, in the
â p relent cafe, that the commilHons to French
privateers were general, and that if they
Vere reftncled this was by private induc
tions, I'hey could, he anfivererf, cruile only
where the law of nations declared it lawful
II the French had given authori
ty to their privateers to cruifeon neutral ter
ory, t.iea<ft is an absolute declaration of*
?r; ifnofnch power is given it is a tref
pals on the part of the privateer. If power
vas given, and :t is to be coniidered as a de
oration of war, then the captu.c and captor
"JÂ»J he seized by virtue of the Jaws cf war â¢
Â» if be a trespass on the part of the privateer,
the privateer i, subject to the jaws of the
Country for the offence.
U next remains to be determined how far
,^ Ur ' Alon of 3 ""''W country ex
mMh ifl" â¢ It J s g T R to Â° lar 10 f *y with
. â  ft lHchel,4n tbecafe cited in the morning,
that the velTe! belonging to a neutral country
is as a part of. the territory-'
of that country ; but to some dtftance at lea *
a nation has certainly jurifiUfHosr. Lee 122
fays, that a King of Spain had arbitrarily fix
ed this distance to be within fight of land j
but Bynkerihoek fettled it, and Lee agrees
with hinr, that the at sea extends
so far as the power of arms from the land can
make itrrespected.c c ted. I Vattel j. 289, agrees,
that a nation can claimjjurisdi c tion so far
from her shore as Hie can make her claim ref
pec!>?d, or so far as neceflary fprher fa&ty.-â
within cannon ihot, and for this vcafon a vei
fel taken under t!ie cannon of a fortrefs is not
a lawful prize. So fays 2 Grotius ch 3. Jcc.
*3-
In the firft fe&imi of the separate article of
the treaty with Sweden, the Â£tli article of
the treaty with the Netherlands, and the 7th
article of the treaty with Pruilia, the protec
tion to be extended to each other is expreffiy
stipulated, within the refpe<shve jurifdr&ion
of the fev>raj countries, aiui in some one of
these 12 miles is made the distance. If this
distance is fought for in the lav's, cannon shot
will b? found the rule,, this is generally
ted to be 3 leagues, and this distance, iÂ»e faic",
he believed was mentioned in the com millions
toEngliHi privateers. If the capture in quef
tion is made within the distance, then we are
injured, and if any injury is sustained we have
a right to vindicate it.
He next turned to the third point he wish
ed to ellablilii,
It is contended, that wc have no right to
enquire into the validity of the capture ; the
enquiry, he said, is already inftitutcd, but this
enquiry docs not iivrerfere with the principles
ot peace and neutrality which we wish to pre
fer ve towards the belligerent powers. We do
not want to enquire into the motives of the
rupture between them, nor whether the vtfTel
has been captured under every circumftancc
that will render it valid ; but whether it has 1
not been captured upon neutral ground, wtfere j
[ ourjurifiHiftion extends, and where we are
IJdbTna Tfe-p'atect the property of each and eve
ry of the belligerent powers.
True the business may l>e fettled by nego
ciation, but a judicial decision is one of the
modes of lettleinent, it is a convenient mode,
cou r ts of admiralty take the law of natiftr*
for their guide ; a foreigner can enter such a
court wit hout fear. 1. Magens 487 â490
2. Woodifon 450.
A judicial decision is more conformable to
justice, than that which may be obtained by
negociation between executives. The firft
decides according to well known principles,
and gives judgment on the merits of the cafe
abflra&edly confidercd. The executive as
often ivgaitfed by motives of policy.
He said something further to Jh** .1
a judicial decision in cases of this nature is
preferable to one brought about by negociati
on. But even fnppofe them equally good,where
then is the impropriety of adopting the firft
in the present cafe.
He turned-to foveral authorities to fcew
that admiralty courts have constantly taken
cognizance of cases somewhat similar to the
prelent, wben they bail the thing or fetftn
within their jurildiiSon.

He cited a csrfe by wTsich it Sheared that
the Duke of Tufcany had ordered reHjjgiwi
of a vell'el in the port of Leghorn. ,
In all the cases-cited the matters had been
judged by judiciary courts except in the lad
cafe ; but t'len it is to lie observed that the
Duke of TulcaÃy is u despotic prince. Byn
kerlhoek expressly fays, that where no treaty
interferes the court of admiralty of a neutral
nation is equal to both parties. Strict ju2ice
could indeed be expected sooner from a court
of this kind ;he cited Bynkerlhuek i 4. 17, to
elucidate this point. _/s
Douglafs 579 eftabliflles, Wtttn.l
court may have ajuriltWtion over prizes, but
it is heft to bring back the prizes to the port
wheie the captor belongs. Upon the who'e
he obfei ved, this appeared among law wri.
ters a disputed point, whether a neutral ad-
miralty court can condemn prizes. However
the question now hefote the court h not to
condemn a priz", but to declare whether this
veire! has not been taken upon neutrai ground.
It was said, that thi> capture was no in
jury to Great-Britain, sut iuch an injury as
Ihe could 1 ail upon us to redress, that the
capture of the veflel could only be considered
as a narural copjeqnence of the war. He did
not lee the thing in this light; the veflel took
refuse on our coast, in the arms of the Uciied
States as it we:e; it was thenceforth the
duty of the Union to protect her, and Great-
Britain had a right to require it of us.
If it is no violation of the law of nations to
have a velTel, which we ought to protetff,
captured within the limits of our jnrifdiftion
off the coast, why may not a French privateer
take an enemy from our port W 9Â»t her from
our wharves?

Mr. Sergeant answered, that the fnvefcign

and prevent it.
Mr. fUwle concluded by addjngan instance
from the 2d vol. of Lode des Ftijei a French
weik, page 887, to (hew, thai id France an
admilalty court had taken cognizance of a
prizr taken by the American frigate Alliance
Capt. Landais.
He closed by hoping that the cause wotild
be ItifFered to proceed. From: he well known
spirit of liberty and jullice which breathes
throngh all the public a<fh of France fmte her

be pefcdtly fatisfied with this equitable mode

relied his undertaking upon this re

" His principles recalled him to
that coiitliiuiion, which was once

Letter from Citizens Dubois, Du
bais, and Briez, Representatives
of the French people at Valenci
ennes, 'April 10, i 79?, to General
I'rince de Saxs Cobourg, Com-
Blander in Chief of the Imperial
Ai my.
General,
The citizen deputies, to whom
you addrelled your yesterday's let
ter, ate no longer at Valenciennes ;
we fopp'y 'heir place's, and w<?
pj-ofefs the Time principles with
them. We have the fame duties to
fulfil, the fame oaths to keep, and
we are polleli'ed of the fame powers,
delegated from the National Re
presentation of the Republic.
General, we agrea with you, that
to differ in opinion is no crime ; for
a crime, according to the law, is at
tached only to action* ; and it is
only for actions which ate criminal
and traiteroos ill th,e eyes of all na
l-iof.s, and even in yours, that Du
nioiirier hat rendered himlelt inta
mousaiid aiiaitor; whilst he might
have covered himfelf with glory in
i iÂ»Â£eÂ£ui.|Â» serving his country, and dy
â  iiij> in its defence, if iieselljry.
It was <ei t3iniy a great crime to
pretend to oppofc his own will to
that of the nation, and to propffft
to ihem any government whatever.
The w ill of a general of an army,
in oppi fitinn to legal authorities,
even if good, can be nothing hot r>
violation of all principles, and a
great crime against national sove
reignty. But what did Gen. Lu
mourier vrjlh for ? The fame that
our moll inveterate enemies no*
vvifh for, viz. To seduce our troops,
to direct rhem against their country,
(ogive us a new Tyrant, and to
league theinfelves wiih our enemies,
in order to accomplish these de
signs. What more could Dumou
rier have done ? Has guilty La lay
ette, whom he himfelf condemned
to infamy, done any thing else ?
Has not he himfelf sworn fidelity
to tbe Republic*, and for this oa'h
obtained the confidence of the
French ? You, general, reap the
advantages of'his perfidy, bur you
do nor pardon hi til for the fanijf".
The coiiftimtion, wheh, you fay,
was once our idol, fell into ruins
by the endeavors of '.hose who
wif; for it now and did not
willi for it at that time. The nati
on had tnade a trial, and in the ex
periment they were difgnfted with
it forever. The nation, and they
had a right to do I'o, infilled upon a
Republican government, and swore
to support it, or bury theinfelves in
its ruins.
We know of no divifioii amongst
the members of the Convention.
That altenibly is one and indivifibke

exchequer office, of goods, or other lecurities.
Twenty commtlfioriers are chosen to .put the
adt into execution. The fmil left fuin to be

be admitted on manufactured goods, and 6o

In the National Gazette of the Bik wjlant is an ar
tiest denominated. authentic e xtratt of, a letter
from a gtrttieman in Philadelphia, to his Lor res
pondent iff Nezu&f.jrk, June J, 1793- Un wf, ' n /l
a writer in the American Mercury mikes the jot-
I:wing comments :
IT appears a little extraordinary, fir, that
an authentic letter of this tenor, Ihould have
found its way into the National Gazette.â
The writer of such sentiments would hardly
have earned them to the printw himfelf :
His own'fyfety would have prevented !uch an
action. Nor can it be imagined that bis cot*-
respondent would have procim d its publica
tion in that paper. If his dfiCpofition had led
him to extern! a private correspondence to
the eyes of the world, he would p: o'oabiy have
a printer in New-York., and not ra
ken tire troubie to tran!mit to Philadelphia
(the residence of the writer) such a proof of
his own vileneA-âI fay vilettefs âbecause so
flagrant a violation of the laws of friendfhip,
iu any instance, would merit a reproach equal
ly severe. Besides, the letter mutt have tra
velled with surprizing rapidity, as it is dated
the 7th of June, and printed the Bth.
But lir, I have not entered into this rea
soning, becauff I suppose it necessary to con
vince any person, that this piece was veiled
under the form of a letter, to conceal its ori
ginâlts own complexion loudly announces
its birch. My object was to place the testi
mony in a train not to be gainiayed by the
boldest effrontery.
The probability is, that this " Authentic ex
trafl" is the offspring of that virtuous, and
patriotic horde, which has long filled the Na
tional Gazette with every Cpecies of inflam
matory, and treasonable composition ; A horde,
the sole merit of which exists in a fixed enmi
ty, i\ot only to the constitution of the United
States, but toeverpidea ot political peace
I Ã¼bot di na 11on.
From the fame source, springs the clamour
in tlorfgreft, refpefting " true rcpvbiican,ifm,"
H arifloci atic and court intrigue, ' which
if fuffered to operate freely, and extensively,
would destroy the peacc of the happiest couin
try.on earth, and change a terrestrial para
dile into a field of blood. From the fame
source, illues that storm of abuse ami invec
tive,- which is wickedly designed to darken the
Qhara&er of the greatest and bell of men,.and
is rendered harmless only by its own -impo
tence and hafeiTeft. To the members of riiis
political alfuciation, law is a Jcourge, justice
a fiend, and lational felicity a stare of infinite
to ment. These are the patriots, who to
save their countiy from British arms, would
proclaim war that nation, aided byal)
the powers in "Europe.
