THOUGHTS ON THE
STATE OF AMERICAN INDIANS.
(Continued Jrom A'o. 99' Â°J
\ NOTHER. important step to lie taken in
XI bringing the aborigines of this country
to civilized manners, is the permanent eftab
lifliment of mariage between a Jingle pair â
Tbe practice of polygamy* âtlie informalities
of the marriage contraftfâ rhe tVf S u "? nt
and causeless reparation:,? which take place
anions them, call tor a reform. Polygamy is
condemned by natureâthe proportion which
â¢xifts between the two sexesâthe aiftnal ex
perience of its inefficacy to promote popula
tion, and the jealou'y, diftrull and inhumanity,
it creates, prove it incompatible with the in
tereils of focietv or morals.
The formalities at the commencement of
the contrast, are so few and unimportant, as
leave no durable imp re ill on of the obligations
it confersâand the frequent divorces and
renewed marriages, leTen domeftx harmony,
weaken parental affection, and retard the
multiplication of* the Â£p.cie s. The initiation
of marriage, is one of the foundation princi
ples of civil society. It at once raises tliafe
male !'ex from that (late of degradation in
tvhich savage nations have confined then), to
the rank and influence to which by the equal
laws of nature they are entitled gives
them that ascendency over the public opinion
and manners, which they are peculiarly fitted
to maintain. The delicacy of their constitu
tions, the exquisite fanfibility of their pallions,
the foftnefc of thetr manners, and the attrac
tions of love, are calculated to temper the
fierce paflions, and humanize the coarser feel
ings of the msn. The ellimation of women
is in effect a diftinguilhing mark of growing
refinement.
MarriaÂ»e also lays t'.ie mod folidfoundation
or domestic happiness and the in create of po
pulation. A community of good":âa partici
pation of joy and sorrowâmutual in te reft in
each others reputation âthe habit of recipro
cal attention! and kindrceiles, and the equal
and interelling care of the offspring, ft length
en the attachment 6f the parent?, sweeten
the ties which unite them, and add rtew de
lights toall the scenes of dpmeftic intercourse.
Marriage further jjnfures the care ofebirh the
parents to support and educate their children,'
and to train tliem to ferae employment by
-which they may be able to obtain their own
subsistence, and contribute to t'.ie wealth and
strength of the community.
It is in the narrow circle of domestic socie
ty that good members of the community are
formed. There the principles of order, Iv
bordinatioll and induftty, are firjl acquired,
and vouth t' ained for the duties of manhood.
In the means employed by ancient legisla
tors to introduce the institution of marriage,
to rentier it honorable, and lo prevent the vi
olation ps it, we traca the high elteem in
which they held it.s
The more effectually to destroy the promis
cuous and temporary connexion which gene
rally provails between the sexes in ,rude and
lavage nations, and to introduce the custom
of a permanent union between a single pairâ
they incorporated the form of marriage with
the ceremonies of religion, and fanftioned it
by t : ie authority of the laws.
Thev also availed themselves of thofc cus
toms to which accident or neceffityhad given
birth, and by blending them with their infti
tutlpns, facilitated their reception, and aug
mented the public veneration for rr.odefty a ,d
cbcorum. In later times, the fame princi
ples have been adopted for the fame purpose.
Thus the man always solicits. The ceremony
is performed by a person invested with autho
rity, in the presence of the relations and
friends of the partie-., attended with some ast
of religion. So highly was the conjugal union
efleemed among the ancient Greeks, that
above two centuries elapsed before widows
dnrft marrv again, and the lurprife of anti
quity has tranfm'tted us the name of the wo
man whofirit entered on a ieoond marriageâ
celibacy was oifgvaceful, and barremicts was
deemed a great misfortune.||
Children born in lawful wedlock were an
honor and an ornament to their parents, and
gave them rank smd diftinftion among their
fellow citizens.
In Home marriage was encouraged by an
nexing particular privileges to ir. Those
who bad the mod children, ceteris paribus, were
always preferred. Thus the confn'i who had
the mo ft numerous offspring, received the en
signs of'office firft, and bed the choice of tlie
provinces. The senator, in like cirenmftan
ces, had hit name written firft in the cata
logue, and the privilege of dtfivei ing his opi
nion firft in the fcnate. Such were sooner ca*
pubic of office, and were exempted from such
as were tropb'efome.l

The severe law? of almost all nations a
gainlVconjugal infidelity difcovcr to us the
refpe<st they entertained for modeQy, an( l the
care thry employed to preserve the public ve
neration for itâamong the Egyptians, Gre
cians, Romans, Hindoos, Germans, and Pe
ruviansâthe crime of adultery was punished
with extreme rigor.
Thus by establishing a permanent union be
twee 11 a jingle pairâby obtaining the public
fentimeut in favor of itâby ena&ing laws to
prevent the violation of the contract and by
strengthening the natural guards to morteftv,
ancient legislators brought their people from
promiscuous love to a lawful and honorable
connection, and rendered it a powerful inftru
merrt in improving their manners and in
bringing them to a relish for ciyii society.
Let these precautions which have succeed
ed in'other nations be taken to establish mai
riages among our American let the

MR. FEN NO,
IN j unification of the French revolution
which proinifes to be productive of foiiiucb
good to mankind, though unhappily attended
with fomc very disagreeable appenda< es in
bringing it about, permit me to recapitulate,
some observations I have met with in the
course of my reading on the civil war of
Great Britain in the last centu-y.
u Tlie English have, by more historians
than one, been much reproached for entering
so readily into a civil war agtinft thtir so
vereign, and the fame reflexions have been
made against other nations, tbat have been
actuated by the fatoe spirit : It may not
the efore be amfs t<S enquire into the pro
priety of this opinion and draw a flight pa
rallel between the value of Liberty, and the
unhappy effetts which must neceifarily atrend
the ailertion of it, by violent meansâlf the
latter are found to outweigh the formev, tbofe
who have made such remarks are doubtlcls in
the right, and have proved fuHicicntly that h
nation when she finrfs her liberties attacked,
had better resign them all ?,t once, and by
that means escape the horrors of a civil war.
But if coolness is pardonable in answering
such a proportion, let us ask a plain quellion
without the least hearâWhat on earth is so
valuable as freedom ? Cart any Sacrifices too
great be made for the preservation of that,
without which nothings any longer of value ;
without which all poflcUlon, even of the com
mon rights of nature, enjoyment of health,
family, fortune and every thing most dear to
the human mind is totally precarious ! Can
any,one hesitate a moment in answering this
query I A florid description of the honors of
a civil war, may be the answer. But why
are these cffe&s called horrors ? Surely be
canfe they are deftru&ive of those very con
nections and poifeflions, the fecuiity of which
fly on the approach of arbitrary power. Can
a civil war be the ruin of any thing, which
despotism will spare ? Are not domestic con
vulsionl; temporary, and the loss of liberty per
petual ? May not the security of every thing
valuable to mankind, be rendered permanent
by a resolute defence of liberty ? Is any thing
gained by its loss ? where then, in the name
of common sense, can be found an argument
futficient to level the compÂ«vifon.
But I ain not much surprised at historians
disliking the age wherein public liberty is
alFerted; the reign of Charles the firft can
not figure like that of an Anne, wherein the
a&ions of a Marlborough are recitedânor
like that of a Lorn XIV. <vherein the mo
narch is the grand Hero. But where a peo
ple are struggling for their liberty-â'where
the legislative power is conftantJy involved â¦
in disputes with an M designing executive,
the historic page is by no means brilliant.
The nation's jealousy and ftubbornefs may
hare some bad consequences in the opinion of
cou-tiersâ-the reign may not be fliining, but
perplexed and crabbed, filled with the circle
of endless disputes, and aIJ the jarring diflo
nance of patriotism and power, party and
corruption, accusation and defence, with a
long string offufpicions and fears,which make
a wretched figure in hiftpryâ-in such a litua
tion even the public foreign affairs will fuffer.
Paltry considerations ! Let them : The peo
ple however are feturitg their Liberty; ai d
they had better preserve that, with such fan
cied disgrace, than lose it triumphing in the
midst of glory.
I ain persuaded that a free nation, had bet-
ter be continually involved in disgusting dis
putes between courtiers and patriots, in all
the minutÂ»Â»of discontent, and jealous of the
power of government, be aiming ever at fix
ing new bounds to ambition, and raiting frelh
obstacles to despotic designs better far let
their annah be defpiled in future age;, as a
collection of difguftinÂ£ quarrels and vaih vio
413
lenres, than hare therti fliitie with the glori
ous but diabolic details, which enliven and
adorn the page of an hiftonpn.â'The con
quests of an Alexanderâthe fla lightered mil-
lions of a Caesarâ- the daring rashness of a !
Charles ; and the victorious career of a Fre
deric ; âThefe are the tales of wonder which
glow in fp endid colours beneath the pencil of
an admirin-g recorder ; these are the wretch
cs who fill the world with carnageâtrample
on the liberties of mankind"-âbreak thus all
the ties of nature, and leave their uames fore
moil on tl}e lift of Fame.-âl 4 this fame ?Is
fame the rfcward of these military heroes, who
to use an excellent expre&on of RofTeau,â
arc good #>r nothing h - to knock one ano
ther, on the headâwhat a pother is made a
bout this fjime ! This {hilling phantom which
glitters oil the ruins of humanity ! The ines
timable worth of liberty is not to be put in
competition with these alone, but with civil
wars themselves and every domestic convul
sion that can'difturb a free people :â  No hor
rors are too g>eat to hazard for the enjoyment
of this of all earthly blefTnigs. Take
the long run fcf several ages, and it will be
found that public freedom. luis feidom bee-n
ft-cured u by means of domestic war; En
gland has n&ttre than once bee,n a pregnant
inflance of this. To the courage of worthy
patriot, exerted in the field agair.ft the sway
of tyranny, is that freedom owing, which we
now enjoy and is the envy of nine tenths of
Europe. It is to the convulsions which shook
England in the middle of the laiV century,
that fucceedmg owe their liberty. Tho'e
wars, it is true, were vety terrible (though
not half fomtoch so, as <# e modern campaign)
but had they been fifty times more so, would
a brave nation hesitate to hazard all, to over.,
turn the effc&s of arbitrary power ? No,
paint the terrors of domeilic war in the mod
ftrikiMg cftlours ; the terrors of despotism
will be more terrible itii! ; infinitely are all
imaginable Jiorrors of that kind Co be prefer
red to the deadly, tranquility which biood*
over a nation of (lavesâbefore that stats of

Heart brethren, whoNare combating the fell
hosts of tyrants, in defence of their own na
tural.rights, and the rights of mankind ; and
deplo;e, that a nation, from whom we are
descended, fliould be among the firft in the
conspiracy against Liberty. We <ee, with
pain and horror, the Confederation of all Eu
ropean despots against Freedomâtheir united
efforts to fupercede thc general will ,of France :
but though foes encompass her b'ave Amis, we

invincible, artd that the millenium ofjtolitlcal
happiness, is opening its profpefts upon them.
The combinations of the sovereignty of the

these will be at length so well underflood, as
to fix.the Rights of Man upon an immovea

give an example to the European world, of

EXTRACTS,

IN the human body it is the com
bination of the organs which
form the Cotiftirtitionâthe head
dictates laws and the other niembeis
execute. It is eliential that the head
which represents the legiftativfe and
judicial powe> s, Ihould be calm and
deliberate in its decrees, and that
the arm, repreffcnting the execu
tive power, Ihould have proi.ipti
tutle and force.
Montesq_uieu, having'fir ft esta
blished the diltiritftioii of the three
powers, proved that they existed in
every form of government, whether
Democracy or Monarchy, Despotism
or Aristocracy, in like manner Â».s
the primitive colours exilt and are
found in every ray of the bun.
Such is the leading idea of this
great man. But he has not said
with a fufficient clearness, in treat
ing on the difFerefit kinds of govern
ment, that a pure democracy as well
as art absolute defpotifisi did nor and
cannot exist on eatrthâthat they
are two ci eat ure9 of our i magi nai ion,
two conceptions of the mind, two
models of which all the governments
in the world hear (lime resemblance
â for there is in fadt no state where
the people at once govern always
by themselves without representa
tion ; nor is there any empire on
the globe where the will of an in
dividual governs without cnntronl.
Whence it follows, that a~. all polfi
hle governments float between pure
democracy and abfcl-ute despotism,
as between two extremes to which
they more or less approach, there
is not and never will be in the
world but Arijiu;raciei, that is to
fay, mixed governments. This name
is properly given to the govern
ment of those States where 11 perm;-
nent senate governs all without ever
consulting the people. Such is Ve
nice whicti is also called a Repub
lic ; it is a pure ariflocracy in this
fettle, that the three powers are in
the hands of the noble*. Thatllaie
in which the will of an individual
is molt frequently a law, and de
cides on the life or death of the
fnbjeft, is called a despotic Hate.
Such is (he Turkifli empire. But it
is not true that the Sultan is abso
lute master ; his power finds limits
at every step he advances, and he is
obliged to refpedt them. This em
pire then is between arirtocracy and
despotism, but inclines towards 'he
latter. In fine, the (late where the
people choose their inagifhates for
a fixed period, and often aflemble to
exercise the sovereignty, is a demo
cracy, aÂ«d is called a republic ;
such were Athens and Rome, and
such are the United States of Ame
rica. The government of tlie-fe
states is between an aristocracy and
GSNETdemociary, but iodine toWÂ«Â»'dÂ» the
latter. Pure democracy and ablo
lute defpotiltn are the two primi
tive colour!, the (hades of which
prevail more or left in every kind
of government.
THE Sovereignty is in the People.
This, doubileis, is true ; but it is
in an implied manner, that is to lay,
that the people never (hall exercile
it but to appoint their representa
tives, and in a monarchy, that the
king (hall always be the firft n'agiO
traieâThus, although it be in taei
true, that every thing comes from
the earth, it is (till neceflTary tofub
due it by labor and culture, as we
fubiedl the people by the authority
and by the laws. The sovereignty
is in tl<e people as fruit is in the
fields, in an abftraA manner. It is
neceflary tha: the fruit palles by the
tree which produces it, and the pub
lic authority by-the sceptre which
excrcifes it. Ctolutnbâ¢ dentinet.

Abridgement oj the State of Politics for
this we-ek.
It is an observation of Lord Ba
con's, that " the best things of na
ture, when corrupted, become the
worftâCorruptio optimi fit peffi
ma." There is not a more noble
or more animating passion that fires
the human breast than the love of
liberty. But even this paffion,when
it bursts the barriers,of rea(on, and
lays-profit ate every other consider
ation, degenerates into a torrent of
licentiousness, bold and irrefiftable
iu proportion to the vigour of that
ere<ft sentiment of which it is
an unfortunate perverhon, which
sweeps before it the gradual and
leifnrely monuments of humanity,
refinement, and political and civil
government,and reftoresand threat
ens the reign of anarchy, common
ly followed by that of despotic pow
er. The truth of Lord Verulam's
position with refpe<ft to things mo
ral and political, is fatally verified
by the present disastrous state of
France.
A moderate and not nnreafonable
share of fcbe rty was offered to the
French nation by the late excellent
King : & greater was aflumed, with
out opposition on the part of the
monarch, by the firft National As
sembly, without due confidei ation
of all the mutual dependencies of
the French monarchy, and how
strong a head and hand it required
to keep togeiher so vast and so com
plicated a fabric. The political in
fignificance of the king, unluppnrt
ed as he was by an intermediatory
power between the throne and the
generhl afl'embly,. was quickly fol
lowed by tumult and not a little
bloodshed. The lecond National
Afl'embly alfumcd more liberjy, and
blood began to flow a-pace. This
democracy, according to a very just
though nire difciintinarion, was
soon changed into aLaocracy. The
mob of Paris gave law to the Aflem
bly and the ination. Horrors and
maflacres were multiplied, and are
Â£1511 increafcd. Infurretftions begin
to appear at Bourdeaux, Lyons, and
other places in France, inoppofition
to the sudden and ill-digested go
vernment of the ufurpprs. Civil
war is kindled in the interior, while
the world, combined in arms, prefl
es on the frontiersof France. The
miseries of that unhappy kingdom
verge fad to the extremity of poli
tical distress, that knows no conso
lation save only this, that it cannot
be lasting ; and contemplates the
alternative of quick recovery or
speedy diflolution.
But the ills of this dilmal date of
affairs are not confined to one coun
try or one ageâLiberty is wound
ed by her votaries ran madâthe
cause of justice and freedom is hurt
by the injustice of those who only
afiume her name, and whose moral
conduit,unreftaained hpf iioralprin
ciple, coincides exatfjy with brutal
appetite and physical necedity.

wise fend you some account of the pro
ceedings of - the Jacobin Club, and the
Commune, which at this crisis are of con
siderable importance. The clubs, yoa
will fee, now exercise both the legislative
and executive functions of government,
and while they didate to the deliberations
of the Convention, iflue their mandates
with all the imperioufnefs of conflicted
authority. These I accompany with some
little details, which will moie clearly
(hew you the state of facts, and the spi
rit which prevails in this capital.
By some, Dumourier is accused aÂ« a
traitor, and as having acted all along with
views hostile to his country. By others,
his conduct is juftified upon the ground
of necessity, and reprefemed as the only
resource which his present situation allow
ed. He has been publicly threatened
with assassination. In th; club of Cor
deliers, it wasrefolved on the 26th March
that he and the other commanders of the
army (hould be brought to Paris in order
to be tried ; "and if," ct ied some of 1 hose
present, " they escape the tribunal, they
(hall not escape us."
In consequence of an order of the com
mittee of fuperintendance, all the papers
of Roland have been sealed up. He is
accused of being concerned in the confe
deracy with Dumourier.
Oiders of arrest are iffutd against Mef
dames Sillery, Egalite, Lady Fitzgerald j
against Valence, Egalite the younger,
Montjoye, and others, who are officers
under the command of Dumourier.
" CLAIRFAYT."
Danton, the other day, used in the con
vention, a iimile certainly by no means
inapplicable to the present Itate of the
French Legislation. " A great Revo
lution, said he, is like a met3l which boil*
in a furnace ; the statue of Liberty is not
yet founded ; if you do not know how
to manage the furnace, the metal will boil
over and burn you."
The Commissioners of public fafety
have announced to the convention the
discovery ac Chatuilly, of the most valu
able effe&s of the Prince of Conde.â
They have already sent to Paris 2208
marks of gold and lilver. They itate too
that they have found there a vast number
of letters, among which were some from
the late King, the Queen, Madame Eli
zabeth, Neckar, Calonne, Dubarry, &c.
and the secret motives of the expences of
the Red Book, and various articles rela
tive to the Revolution. As it wasfup
pofed that much more remained to be dis
covered, two commissioners were ordered
by the convention to proceed to Chantil
ly. Having rcached the place of their
detlination, they wrote that they had dif
covercd various secret openings in the
walls of the palace, in which were new
made mulkets and ammunition, papers,
and two boxes of jewels. They demand
ed powers to feaich the houses and papers
of variovs persons fufpe&ed of concealing
efFeÂ£tsof the late Prince of Conde. New
commissioners and new powers were sent
to them, with particular inltrudtions to
prefeive the Cabinet of Natural Hiltory.
1 lie confufion which reigns here can
more easily be conceived than described.
We seem to have returned to a Hate of
complete and political chaos. All is tu
mult and disorder. In this situation,
force alone can decide, and difcntangle
the jarring elements. Those however,
whofoiefce a fyeedy conclutkm to the
prefe.it (lalft of diltra&ion, will p' :>i
be miltaken. That order will fpnng ti a
confufion, and fume regular form of g.Â».
vernment facceed to the present anarchv,
is indeed to be hoped, but not speedily
to be looked for. In proportion to the
violence with which diltra&ion now ragei
must be the time it willrequire to subside.
Before the government can be regenera
ted, and the numerous crimes committed
at the different periods of the Rerolutioa
done away, it must be purified by much
blood. Even fiippofe the war Ihould be
brought to a more speedy cOncluGon than
is at present probable, it will be difficult
to determine in what mode things can be
fettled. There is such a collilion of pat
(ions, prejudices and interests that it mult
be leng before any fettled order ofthingÂ»
can take place. What means indeed will
be found to reconcile the wilhes and adjult
the claims of the different paities, it is
impoflible to forefee.
We now touch on a new sera of a re
solution which has been continually va
rying itÂ« form, and giving life to frefti
changes; a revolution which has iftonilh
ed ordinary observers, by the novelty,
magnitude, and rapid fuccclSon of events;
which has filled with horror the friends
of humanity, by the crimes which it has
produced, and the evils with which it
threatens hnmanity : and which has open
ed a new field of curiosity and fpeculati.

part of the convention, which did not

Marat.â" The dangers which threa
ten our country ate at their height, and
the moment has arrived when the courage
of Republicans ought to be displayed-ââ¢
The treacheries of oui* generals are no
longer a mystery.' My predictions are
accomplished. But we have opened our
â¢ eyes too late. A messenger ha 6 been dis
patched to Dumourier, and I will warrant
that by this time he has emigrated. Bour
nonville has set out to seize all the papers
which may tend to convi& himfelf, and
perhaps to try to march againit Paris with
Dumourier.
Danton in a speech of some length,
recapitulated his former services, in hav
ing prevented the miniltry, of which he
was a member, from leaving Palis in Sep
tember last. He knew Dumourier to be
unprincipled and ambitious ; but he knew
his military talents, and wished to give
his country the benefit of them. But
Dumourier conceived the projeÂ£t of con
quering the Netherlands and Holland, ft
making himfelf their Prote&or. All his
a&ions were infeÂ£led by this idea ; and
if he did not annihilate the Prussians in
the camp of La Lane, it was because he
wished to reserve himfelf an asylum in cafe
of defeat, in the dates of Frederick Wil
liam. His retreat from Belgium was ra
ther the faulc of his inferior officers than
his own. Miranda was a fool or a trai
tor. When Dumourier returned from
Holland to Belgiunl he was quite dejec
ted. The failure of hjs visionary projedU
reduced him almolt to a (late of insanity.
He retained nothing of a Republican but
his military ardour, and fought every 2
leagues. " But, continued the speaker,
let us leave this raving general, and think
only of saving the Republic. France is
far from having lolt her force. Under
Louis XIV. (he combated all Europe,
with resources far inferior. But where
are those resources ? It is for the Jacobins
to find them. It is not enough to have
levied an army of 300,000 men ; we mud
raise a central army to defend Paris, and
succour all the r<;tt. Let the Jacobins
call upon all good citizens, and feleft
those who are the mod capable to defend
their country, and we (hall soon have a
formidable-army. The factious talk of
dissolving the convention ; I cannot bear
the idea of diftolutiun. Let those who
have (hewn themselves too pulillanimous
to join their names to tV'fe wliofe glory
will defcendto posterity, withdraw from
it. Let us engage the people to speakÂ»jnd we-ftiall purge the convention ot those
who are uncapabie of saving the Repub
lic. Those only who have killed a King,
are worthy of representing Republicans.'
Marat.âDumourier is the creatuie of
a- wicked fadtion. He was at firft their
pupil, and now he is their prote&or. I
fufpedl the Commifiioners Camus and
Treillard. Such men ought not to give

I request that Danton will tear aside the
veil before the Tribune of the Conven-
tion."
.Dantonâl engage to comply with
that request."
Maratâ-Aft with energy and courage.

shall do. If the enemy enter France, 1
Jball draw my poinard and fell upon the

than bend the knee. The despair of lit

of known patriotism, who ate not ac

that no naval aid being necelfary on the

*Â» majesty's (hips from thence ; the gun
boats had been all orevioufly laid up io
the arsenal of Rotterdam before he left
h'is (hip.
All the letters brought by the Dutch and
Flanders mails yesterday confirm the accounts
of the declaration of General Dumourier in
lavor of monarchy, and his being on his march
tO . P ! r^ to topport tfrfre-rfftabliftiment of a
regal government in France. The fame let
ten mention'other defeats of the French be
fore Merrtz and at Nitaa. In fliort, the late
twiverfal defeat of the French seems, if pâr.
fible, more rapid than their former iucceiles ;
and the decided part taken by their command,
er in chief, added to the vigorous proceedings
of the Couoter-Revolutionifts in France, ap
pear more likely to be the means of re-efla
bjifhing a permanent form of government in
(hit country.
Ge ieral Dumourier certainly marched on
the 3d for Pars, with the avowed intention
at restoring the Monarchy of France. He
was joined 0.1 hh march bv numbers of peo
ple, who, shocked with the iniquitous mur.
der of Louis the Sixteenth, were now happy
in an opportunity of declaring their fenri
ments.
Previous to Dumourier's quitting Lisle, he
put a white cockade into his hat, and all tho
army fillowed his example, a; fad as ribbons
could be procured fÂ»r them. We nnderftard
that the white flag is flying on the tower of
the garrison at Lisle, in which Dumourier left
a garrison on whom be couy depend.

France, it appears that the general body of
the people on the sea coasts adjacent to Flan

CHARLESTON, (S. C.) May 13.
Yesterday evening a gentleman arrived
here from in Georgia, who informs
ns. that fix of tile Creek towns, with a number
of Cherokee*, had declared war against the
United States, and were actually marching
under the command of Bowles and Galptiin,
to attack the frontiers.
An Angnfta jjaper contains the following
intelligence : Augusta, M;i; 4.
We have it now in Our* power, tram the best
authority, to give the following melancholy
particulars to the public, attending the ,mur
d?r of the family 011 the Oconee river, on the
23d ultimo.
The Indians, 37 in number, came to the
house of a Mr. Richard Threlher, and fired
upon and killed Mr. Threlher, two children
and a negro woman ; Mrs.Threflier to avoid,
if pnflihle, the fate with which she was threat
ened, fk-d, with an infant of about 5 or 6
weeks old in her arms, and leaped into the
riverâthe Indians pursued, (hot her through
each thigh and rigfit breast, dabbed her irt the
left breast with a knife, cut her left arm near
ly off,and then scalped her. In this horrid
fitpatinn (he remained until the neighbours
could aflimble in fufljeient numbers to cross
the river and purine the jndians. As the
i;rft canoe was crossing flie had ftrengthenough
to call for affiflance, they went, found her
hanging by a bush in water nearly up to the
chin, her infant at the bottom of the liver a
fewyards from tierâflie lived nearly 24 hours,
and when informed by her physician that it
was impoflilile for her to furvivesmich longer,
she with a fortitude, that is rarely to be met
with, called her friends around her, and in a
Calm but pathetic manner, gave her hand to
each one, wishing them a better fate than
had befallen herfelf and family ; and when af
ter her speech failed, as neighbours werecon
ftantly coming in, (he continued to give her
hand, until about five minutes before she re
signed he' breath, which was without a groan.
Mrs. Threlher was about 25 years of age,
of a relpeftable family, an elegant person.and
polfeffed an uncommon education.
On Thnrfday the 24th ult. two men were
killed in Franklin, 40 horses carried off; and
since the accounts publiihed in our last, all the
inhabitants on the frontiers have retreated
into forts, without arms or ammunition. At
one meeting of near 40 persons, they could
only muster five old muikets t to heighten she
horror of their condition, the Indiaus were
momently expe&ed.
