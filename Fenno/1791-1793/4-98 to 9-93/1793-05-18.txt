NATIONAL CONVENTION.
March 21.
r r , HE miniiter of liie interior sub-
JL id it ted the propriety of pre
serving peace wi.cn Sweden and Den
mark, oh account of the advantages
of palling the loiind into the Baltic.
He recommended the Convention to
order Come measures to be taken to
prevent American cargoes for France
from being stopped by the Englilh.
Referred to the diplomatic and com>
mert:ial committees.
The committee of finance made a
report, Hating the neceflary expen
ses incurred in I 793,* 604 millions
937 thousand livres, and the conn i
butions of the fame year at 511 mil
lions 500 thousand livres. The ex
pen fes of' 93 may in fonie refpeifts
fuffer a diminution, but again on the
other hand tnuft encreafe in neatly
the fame proportion.
One of the principal caufe3ofthe
gownefs of rcceipt arises from the
inequality of the diib ibution among
the departments. Th'Â« inequality
has given tifc to remonilrances from
60 at'the departments. They re
commended taking every nieafure
to equalize the public buidesns ;
which are best paiJ when tlaiqted
in justice.

After the reading of the difpauhts
from Gen. Dumourierand Valence,
Marat cried out, " This is Hit) the
artifice of treacherous chiefs : when
tinfuccefsful ihey attempt to hide
their mifcondaA by calumniating
the patriotic foMiery. If an; thefiÃ
have been committed, il is becanfe

rupted Marat ; he, however, railing
his voice, laid, " this is the mo-
ment to tear the veil ; Â«p Vitive no
disciplined troops to give batiie"â
Murmurs re commenced with more
violence. " Let him," said Mazuy
er, " vomit the indecencies and the
venom which devours him"â" My
aim," continued Marat. " is to saVe
the republic. We aught to Confine
ourselves to the defence of our own
territory, and I aflc to be added to
the committee of general defence,
to communicate a plan, the execu
tion of which will render us invul
nerable." The President obfetved,
that every member was at liberty
to communicate his fentimems to
any of the committees.
Lecontre Puyraueau added : "Gb
ferve that the fame man who not
long (ince proclaimed, that the con
vention could not save the republic
because part had 1 not the will and
the other portion not t'j- power,
tells us to day, that we have neither
generals nor troops to oppose out
enemies. What would he lead us
to ?"
The law agairift strangers was

The fetftion have decreed him a

the Frefident of the convention ho

Thursday, at one o'clock, M. Genes t, Mi
nister from the Republic of France to the
United States of America, arrived in this
citv from Charjefton.âln the afternoon the
beiis of Chrift-Churctf" were rung on this oc-
cafion
Mr. Genest lias been violently cenftired by
many, for giving commifilons to the priva
teers fitted out ar Charleston. We can assert,
from good authority, that in so doing he has
only complied with the orders of the execu
tive of France who sent him, and that the
eommiUions are in fa ft from that executive
and only filled up by Mr. Genest, which he is
directed to do when called upon for that pur.
pole.
By an arrival at this port yesterday, in 12
Jays from Antigua, we learn that a Britifti
fleet, conlifting of two 90 gun ftiips, and five
74's, under the command of Admiral Gard
ner, arrived jit Barbadoe": the ajth ult.âalfo,
that a fleet of five fail of the line h.is arrived
at Martinique from France.
A letter from Amsterdam dated sth
April fays, certain intelligence had been le
ceived there, that tws Commiffioncrs had
bteen sent from Paris with orders to conduct
Geo. Dnmourier thitherâtllat he, apprized of
the detign, had (eized the Commissioners and
sent them to ths ImperiaÃfts ; that the French
army had mounted the white cockade and
were inarching to Paris, to restore the old
monarchy, &c." See. The Leydfcn Gazette of
the fame date makes no mention of these
events âthe account therefore is mod pro
bably premature.
Wednesday last Mr. J. Ravara was com
mitted to the goal of this city, charged with
being the writer of several incendiary letters,
to different gentlemen, demanding sums of
money, accompanied with threats in cases of
non-compliance. One Guillioux, a hair
drefler, was the melienger sent for the answers
to the letters, which were to be put into the
poft-office. This circumstance led to a dis
covery of the parties.
Tuesday evening arrived the ship Argonaut,
of Marseilles, Capt. Chobert, from China and
the Isle of France, This velTel was bound to
l'Orient ; but not being well informed of the
state of European politics with refpeft to
peace or war, thought it most prudent to make
for this continent. Has had 72 days-pafiage
from the Isle of France, brings a cargo teas,
nankeens, &rc. in value to the amount of 2
million of livres. She was formerly a fri
gate belonging to the Pope palled the St.
Charles; but- now is private property;â
mounts 14 pieces of 12 and 2of 16 pounders. ,
The Hercules, of Boston, failed from the
Isle of France the 27th February.
By a gentleman who arrived here in 24
days from Port-au-Prince, we are informed
of the troubles which happened thqre last
month. QÂ«iv informant relates, tfi&t~Mr.
Santhonax, the national civil coxnmiffioner,
arrived there in the America, of 74 guns,
with two large frigates, on the 4th of April ;
thatheifTued a thundering proclamation a
gainst the inhabitants, whom he branded with
the term of Counter-revolutionists, and im
puted to them the cause of the infurre<slions
ofthe blacks; that during the sth and 6th
the disputes ran high between the Aristocrats
and Democrats; that on the 7th the national
commilHoners gave orders to the captains and
commanders of the American and French
merchantmen to quit the port, and to retire
out of the reach of the artillery, and get un
der the prote&ion ofthe ships of war. The
Captaifis drew up and signed a pathetic me
morial, and presented the fame to the com
miflioners, remonstrating against the ap
proaching deftruftion of the town ; they were,
however, obliged to comply, and retired out
of the reach of cannon shot, during the 10th
andlith. On the 12th, at nine o'clock in
the morning, the (hip America commenced a
most dreadful cannonade against Foit St.
Clair ; at the fame time the frigates began
to bombard the town, and continued that
dreadful work till the afternoon. The Forts
St, Joseph, St. Clair, and another, returned
the fire with desperate intrepidity. It is
computed that these three ships difchaiged
about balls against the town and forts.
The old men, women and children ran in dif
ferent directions to meet death, 73 Â°f these
killed on the spot. A cart loaded with
powder blew up in one of the forts, by which
accident 8 persons loft their lives. Towards
the clofeof the day Mr. Borell, a leading man
in the town, made his escape with 7>oo white
men, and 100 blacks, to Jacmel. The
coinmiffioners took pofVeflion, and have fir.ce
been organizing the troops, and imprisoning
the difaffected, 300 of whom are now in jail
there.
At a meeting of the citizens of Philadelphia,
at the State Hpul'e, 011 Thursday evening
last,
Charles Biddle, Esq., was r.nanimoufly
called to tbe chair, and R. H. Dunkin, ap
pointed fecvetary.
On motion, it was resolved unan'moufly,
that a committee of 7 citizens be appointed
to prepare an Address to Mr. Genest, Minister
fom the Republic of France to the United
States; whereupon Meifrs. Ritteuhoufe,Dal

The following paragraphs are copied from tit,
( H oft on J Independent Chronicle oj the 9 lit tnjl.
To the innumerable rumours against the
French, their defeats, difaiters and retreats,
&c. we have to oppose the teal jads of the
diftielfesof the British nation. It appears
that their credit is in such low estimation,
that the loan of 4 millions and a half cannot
be effe&ed under the enormous rate of 8 per
cent.-Â»-that the mercantile stability, on
whole support the Ministry has ever relief,
is almost totally annihilatedâa number of the
firft houses have flopped payment; and that
all confidence is at an end among the mer
chantsâthis inuft soon operate among the ma.
nufa<fturers, and the convulsion tliis must oc
caflon, may be better imagined than descri
bed.
The situation of the Britiih nation appears
truly alarming, jnft entering on an expert
five with tlieir finances so deranged, as
to be obliged to give 8 per cent, for the loan
of money to prosecute itâtheir merchants
and manufacturers commencing Bankruptsâ
their fleets unmanned by reason of the com
bination of their independent (earner, in op
poling the pre A-gangsâtheir internal diÂ£
contents with refpeft to the object of the war
-âthe formidable operationsof the Volunteers
in Ireland-âand the immense loss they sustain
by captures.
Gen. Afc.
These circnmftances are fa<sts which can
not be controverted, and bespeak the dif
treflVd state of that nation.âOn the contrary,
no iuch circumstances appear agaiuft the
French : Their loans are easily effectedâ
their finances well regulated nnd adequateâ
their navy completely manned, and what
stamps a national flability as it relates to
their commerce, not a French merchant of
any great note, has failed during the whole
controvefy.
These things confidcrcd, we must be led to
conclude, that France is in the moffc pros
perous situation.
Among a variety of prcdidions and anticipations re
publijhed at the present interring period, the fol
lowing has been extruded from a tcork published
in the year 1701 âby Mr. Robert Fleming, an
eminent Scotch Minijler ;
ic There is ground to hope, that about the
beginning of another such century, things
may again alter for the betterâfor I cannot
but hope, that some new mortification of the
chief supporters of Anti-Christ will then hap
pen ; and perhaps the French monarchy may
begin to be conliderably humbled about that
time ; that whereas the prefeiit French King
takes the fun for his emblem, and this for his
motto, nee pluribus imparâ he may at length,
or rather his fuccefTor, and the monarchy it
felf, at least before the year 1794, be forced
to acknowledge, that (in respeCt to neighbor
ing potentates) he is even Jingu/is impar."
Page 53. .*â¢
We may justly suppose, that the French
monarchy, after it has scorched others, will
ltfeif consume by doing so ; its fire, and that
which is the fuel that maintains it, wafting
insensibly, till it be exhausted at last towards
the end of this century, as the Spanish mo
narchy did before, towards the end of the
lixteenth age." Page 57 58.
Other remarkable extra&s might be marie,
which are omitted on account of their not
applying immediately to the present grand re
volution in Franceâa work which, if it be of
God, cannot be pverthrown by all the com
bined despots and tyrants of the Universe.
ExtraSs of a letter from England to a gen
tleman in this city, dated Bath, February
l%th, 1793.
" The price of tin in European mar
kets, is raised from 58 to 72 per cent.â
by which Cornwall receives tgtween 30
and 40,0001. sterling per annum ; the
greatest part of it from foreign markets ;
so that there is full employment for men,
women, arid children, arid the county not
able to answer the full demand. And yet
itrange tq relate ! the county produces
little corn. Depending on precarious
importations, the poor inhabitants are of
ten deprived of a supply, and grow riot
ous thro' want, even in times of profound
peace. What may be expedted, then,
in this and other piaces similarly situate,
in cafe the present war with France
fliould continue.
" I was agreeably entertained by Mr.
Bartram's travels in the Flor/das and S.
Carolina. His account of Sfhes of prey
living peaceably with the smaller inoffen
five fry, while together in clear, transpa
rent water, is new and curious ! His ac
count of the amiable manners of those
nations whom, thro' pride, we style Sa
vages, isalfovery interesting.âStrange!
that the artificial mode of flattening the
heads of the children of the Chadtaws,
by mechanical comprefiion, long conti
nued, does not derange the faculties of
the -brain ! On the contrary, we read,
they become fenlible, ingenious men ;
bold, intrepid, yet quiet and peaceable
citizens. The method of taming wild
horses, by fait, is a Angular faÂ£t, and
worthy attention.
" In cafe the present troubles in this

Soine called for the printing, o
thers for the rejection of this letter.
Barbaroux speaks in favor of a con
vocation of the primary ailemblies
for the re-election of deputies.
Lafource informed, that among
the fe<ftions of Marseilles, some have
declared, that they would acknow
ledge no law palled with the con
currence of those who voted for the
appeal ; another fediion endeavors
to prevail on the citizens of Paris
to fend the appellants to their re
lpeftive departments in chains.
Lafource moved that these relolves
should be annulled.
The convention decreed, " That
the petition or letter from Mar
seilles is rejected or difappioved, &
that all the resolves of administra
tive bodies relative to this letter
are annulled, as an invasion of the
liberty of opinion, the unity and in
divisibility of the republic."
The commiifioners sent to visit
the ports from l'Orient to Bayonne,
write from Rochefort, on the 18th,
that the rebels having dared to at
tack General Masse, ac the head of
1300 men with seven pieces of can
non, had been put to flight, leaving
one hundred men on the field. We
have had but seven wounded. Gen.
Mace is about pursuing, wi|h a re
inforcement of 2000 men, the re

cation of which place with Antwerp
is dill interrupted. The rebels are
commanded by Gafton, Saint-Her
maine, and Verteuil. Thecommif
fioners announce frefli reinforce
ments from Bourdeaux, &c.
Fabre d'Eglantine informed, that
from the knowledge colletfed by
the police of Paris, and committee
of general fafety,from the exchang
es made every day at the mint of a
quantity of guineas and dollars, it
was evident, that foreign powers
have numerous agents in the repub
lic, and especially in Paris ; he
therefore proposed, in the name of
the comgiittee, to place at the dis
posal of the minifterof the inferior,
a sum of 300,000 livres forfecretex
penfes. Referred to the committee
of finance. March 23.

800 men marched to their relief with 4 pieces
of cannon, from that city.

The administrators arrive to give an ac
count of the troubles and devastations in the
two departmentsof Deux Sevres and Vandee.
It is not, said the orator, mere partial infur
re<stions, it is not a handful of rebels, that the
patriots could easily disperse, but real coun
ter-revolutionary armies. They recruited
among us, but it appears that they formed
themselves in the department of lower Loire.
They march in two columns, one towards
the diflriffc of Challans and that of Sables and
the other to Montaigu. Between these two
main bodies are others less confide rable.â
One Gafton is the commander in chief. One
hundred gallant inhabitants of Fontenay dar
ed to attack at St. Fulgent, 6ooof the rebels.
They could not be fuccefsful, 17 fell on the
spot. The city of Chantenay has been at
tacked, taken and pillaged by the revolrers.
About this timfe General Maci arrived at
St. Hermand. He attacked the rebels and
killed 100 men. The 18th his army retted ;
the 19th he took a bad position, was attacked
and put totally to flight. 6ur defeat was
such that we left 74 or 80 wounded to the
mercy of the counter'.revolutionifts.
The commiflioners of the convention have
deposed Mace, and appointed Col. Botilard
in his stead, who is busy in endeavoring to
gather the scattered remains of our army.
Another administrator adds, that numerous
rebels have been landed by Engliih privateers;
that they con'jft of emigrants and non-juring
priests, who, the crucifix in their hand, in
spire with a spirit of fanaticifm the unfortu
nate inhabitants of the country to such a de
gree, that they, with no other arms than
spades and pitchforks, stand the fire of the
cannon, and think thef attain a place in hea
ven by dying in such a cause.
The administrators concluded by afkingfor
officers in whom the .national guards can con
fide, muikets, cannon, ammunition, and pro
visions and fucconr for 300 families who have
loft their chiefs.

PARIS, March 34.
It is worthy ofremark, that since
the firft checks of the French ar
mies, the commiflioners of the Tem

their piifonersâlt is even faid,that
fonie proposals have been hazarded
by them, to which the Qoten mo

neighboring communes. All the
unmarried men in those places as
sembled at Libourne, and poor as
well as rich, refufed to draw lots :

PETERSBURGH, (Ruf.) Feb. 4,
Our victorious armies are putting

LONDON, April 3
Private letters from Cenftantiuo
ple state, that a conspiracy has been
dete&ed at the Ottoman Court.
The French had, by presents and
promises, corrupted the greatest
part of the Turkish Ministry, and
endeavored to induce them to mur
der the Grand Signior. Everything
had already been so concerted, that
his Sublime Highness was to be
strangled, and war declared against
Austria and Russia.
The Roflian Charge d'Affaires at
Constantinople, had the good for
tune to discover the whole of the
plot, and to give timely notice of
it to the Sultan. All the accomplices
were instantly ftrangjed, and many
Frenchmen, who even, had but the
retnoteft concern in it, were declar
ed outlaws, and their property was
confifcared. Every affiirance of
peace and good understanding was
then given to our court and to that
of Peterlburgh. The Internuncio,
who was about a twelve-month ago
at that court, was amongst the con
spirators, and has received his due
reward.
Every Mail from the Continent
now announces the repulse or re
treat of the French from some of
their conquests in the Netherlands.
On Saturday last they evacuated
Oftend. They had remained there
to the number of 2000, in order to
fend off the veflels in the harbor
with such stores as they could carry
to Dunkirk. The appearance of
the squadron, detached by Captain
Macbride, put a flop to the execu
tion of this design ; two of the Bri
tish vessels entered the harbor, on
the invitation of the inhabitantsâ.
and the French marched ofFina bo
dy to Dunkirk.
Letters from Namur, of March
17, fay, that Gen. Beaulieu, who
was in Luxembourg, with about
14,000 men, had driven the French

of the 30th add, that Namur was
taken, and a detachment of the
Luxembourg army sent to reinforce
the Prince of Saxe-Cobourg, who
was advancing to dislodge Dumou
rier from his pod at Halle.
The city of Dantzic, with the 11-
nanimons consent of all orders, has
formally submitted to the King of

The French emigrants now in
Spain, are to be employed in the

the fame confidence.

grant 110 further supplies to the
French emigrantsâbut diredis that
they be formed into regiments,com

& to retire behind Louvain towards Broffels.
The firft column fell in, near Belemberg,

LONDON, March 21
If the value of a donation is to
be eftiniated by its amount, thefub
i'cription from Eton school claims
pre-eminence. But the merit ot
the gift is enhanced by the promp
titude and sincerity with which it
was given. An hundred guineas to
a charity from school- boys,announc
es such genuine pati iotifm, fucli in
nate and laudable liberality, that
the nation itfelf, high as (he (lands
in the eftituauon of the world, is
honored by the donation. There
is vigor and manhood, as well as
generolity, in the very idea, and
which'none but British Youth would
have conceived or executed.
It is therefore, with a pleasure
bordering on enthusiasm, that we
record the munificent donation of
one hundred guineas given by the
young gentlemen at Eton, to the (b
ciety for the relief f the widows
and children of thole gallant men
who may fall in the lervice of their
country ; and when we cotifider
the spirited connections of many of
thele young gentlemen, and that
they ate destined to the cabinet or
the field, we cannot but feel an hap
py preface, that the British contti
tution'will be tranfmirred pure and
unimpaired to the latest posterity.
Weftininfter, it is said, is follow
ing this example but Eton has the
glory of" having taken the lead on
this, uccafion.
The ladies in Scotland are railing
a fund for the relief of the widows
and'-orphans of such soldiers and
sailors a-s may fill I in battle. The
f'ubfeription is carrying on under
