not betray his country, rob his cre

gary and ruin, in fopport of liberty,
is not worthy the name of a modern
patriot.
A gentleman of veracity in War

L ONDO N, April 9.
From ps Maich to the
third, ii>ft.,/Karis appears to have
been reirtaT'kably quiet, conlideriug
that difatlerons news had been dai
ly pouring in rVorti every quarter.
The Council General of the Com
niiine has been vigilant ; and San
terre, the Commandant General, ac
tive in the discharge of his own du- 1
ty, and ftric'i in compelling those
whom he commands to perform
theirs. The Decree for difqnniiig
all fufpetfied pei sous was rigidly ex
ecuted, and without thc.fniaUrit op
petition. The itate of Paris is vow
more chat of a garrison than of a ci
ty. What effetfts the news of Du
>noiirier's conduct may produce, it
would be piefim>piio|i to anticipate.
The conduiTt of ihe Parillans is not
reducible to any known principles
of human action.

When the Commiliioners of the

orders he had made the French ar

order. " You tiien love the Belgic
provinces !" added he, " very well !
you (hall pay a visit to them your
l'elves."
BrifTo-t's party is now the leading
one ; he carries with hiin 300 mem

f'eemingly undif'may ed, are pre
paring to refiit the renegade re
storer of Monarchy.
The Commiflionerg are lodged in
Maeftricht, by order (>f the Prince
de Cobourg, as a place of the great
elt ffrength. It is said the allies
suspend their operations until the
success of Dumourier is known.

The Gazette, in which errors are
as common as in newspapers of less
emolument, f'eems to have made a
small miltake in the number of pri-
I'oners taken by the Pruftians at the
battle ofÃingen. It states thenoll
commiflioned officers and privates
taken at 200 ; the Bruflels Gazette
extraordinaiy makes the "number
2 COO.
The fame Gazette informs us,that
an aruii'ftice had been agreed upon
between his serene highnefa the
Prince of Saxe Cobourg and general
Duoiourier,' the latter having pre
viously confirmed to evacuate the
Aulirian Netherlands and Dutch
Brnbant.âWhy his serene highness
(hould agree to anarmiftice, on con
dition of Duntourier's doing that,
which if the accounts of his serene
highnefs's vi&ories be true, he was
evidently obliged to do without any
condition, it is not eal'y to imagine.
The natural inference is, either that
Duinourier was (till in fufficient
force to dispute the pofleffion of the
Austrian Netherlands, or that the
prince ofbaxe Cobourghad puichaf

that his army would not fuppoit

throne, had found it necelfary to

This intelligence is said to have
been received by Admiral
from the AuAi'tan commanding offi
ci'r at Oftend.
April 12
Yesterday morning Sir James Mur
ray arrived in town from Oitend,
with dispatches to government. He
left Antwerp the 9th inft. and has
inacje a * ery expeditious journey.
Sir James Murray confirms the le
port of Duuionriei's having been
obliged to return back to the Aus
trian head quarters at Mom.
The following intelligence may
be depended on as being con etft :
General Dumourier, at ilie head
of about 18,000 men, had reached
Canibrai, a town of considerable
ill ength iii the French Netherlands,
and 1 j miles S. W. of Valenciennes,
on his March towards Pari*. In the
coui fe of the 61 li inll. he oblerved
some difaffec r tion in his army, and
having arrived at Canibrai, he ob
served his artillery desert him, as
well as many of the National Volun
teers. He endeavored to rally his
force*, and harrangued the troops
of the line in particular, 111 a very
pathetic Ipeech, exposing to them
the villainy of the National Con
vention, and that it was impoffibJe
for the government to exilt much
lenger. He said it was a disgrace.
to serve such a cause.
The aruiy, in reply, nffured the
Genera] of tlieir persona] attach
ment and refpetft for him, but that
they could not content to follow
him in bis present views, and turn
their backs on the Conttituiion they
had fwurn to support. Finding this
disposition very general, Dumourier
thought it prudent to make good a
retreat as fuft as pofiihle; and on
the 7111 inft. be returned lotheAuf-

irian iieatl.quarters at ar the
Lead of about 1100 Huflars, princi
pally belonging to the regiwcnt of
bercoiny, who bad always bepn
confklered as attached to the Royal
cause.
Young Egalite, who ranked as a
General in ibe army, is returned
vviih DÂ«inÂ«nitier, and has resumed
bis tiile of Duke de Chartres ; ihe
eon/equence of this will probably
be, that as soon as the Convention
bears this news, they will take his
father into custody, and all those
who are nearest attached to him, oiji
fuipicion of being accedaty to Du
iiiourier's treason.
The operations of Dumourier's
army are not known, after his leav
ing it ; it is certainly in a very dif
unired wreuhed (late, and we shall
not be furpi ifed to hear of its hav
ing totally dilbanded itfelf. Du
uiouiiei waj the very life and foul
of the canf'e in which he had em
harked ; and the French will not
find another General of abilities and
courage equal to him.
Gen. Duiwourier did not propose
to remain long at Mons ; he had
considerable expectations of being
able to collect a considerable force
of French Rovalilis in a very short
time, and return to some important
entei pi ize.

mand of Duniourier Vanity on his

The dirertors of the India com
pany have resolved to puc up foqr

i>ir James Murray left Antwerp
on Tuerday ; and btfides a confir
mation of the failure of Dumou
rier's plan for refloiing roj'aity in
France, and his being obliged lo
confuh his perfoua! fafety, by fly
ing from his own army to the Auf
trians ; brought the result of the
Congress held at Antwerp on Mon
day ; at which were present,
The l'rince of Qrange
two lons ; his Excellency Vandv
Spiegel ; his ftoyal Hignnefs the
Duke ot York ; his Excellency Lord
Auckland ; his Excellency -Kul
ler, Miniiler of Pruflia ; his
Kighnefs the Prince dp Saxe Co
bum'g ; his Excellency M. Mettet;-
nich and his two foils ; the Count
rle Staieinbeig ; the Count Mercjr
d'Aigen;e,au ; the Minister of Spain;
the Miniiler of Naples.
The object was to fettle a general
plan fur tlie prosecution of the war ;
and, as i)umourier's defection bad
produced do material alteration, to
determine whether tlie combined
armies Ihotild again attempt the in
vasion of France, or confining the
French within their own frontier,
and cu-.ting them off from external
communication, leave the restora
tion of Monarchy to the efforts of
the Loyalists within the kingdom,
and the natural progress of discon
tent arising from diltrefs ainongthe
people.
In a letiei from Angers in France,
of a very late date, which came by
way of Ortend, it iÂ» (laced chat there
have been two actions below Sau
mur in Brittany, between the Pa
triots and the insurgents. In the
firft aiftion, the Insurgents were de
feated ; in the second, which took
place the next day, they had ample
revenge of the National Guards ot*
Argeis, whose cannon they took.
This success made them mailers of
the bridges of Ce, an important pas
sage over the Loire, which opens
thcni ihe road to Anjou, and gives
them the command of the commu
nication between that province and
Poitou. The bridges of Ce are but
a (holt difianctf from Angers.
IThe ill focceft Â«f the campaign of last yrar.
had taught tue Auftrians and PruiTans the
difionlties that mall attend entering France ;
and produced declarations, tltat it was nut
tUeir intention to diktat? a form of Govern
ment, for the French, but to prevent tlie efc
fcfts of tbofil licentious principles wMeti t'.'irf
ed to tin iobverficn of every cftabli&ed gn
vernraeiit.
By tne however, it was resolved
jto comnrencc a plan of active operations a
gainst France, and instead of the chimerical
project of marching directly to Paris, to be
fiegc at dnce as many as poflibie of the (tron*
places on t .e frontier, which will block up
or call off the greafeft part of the Republican
troojs from the interior of tire Kingdom, and
leave the Royalists within it without much
opposition. If these places fall they wiil be
immediately occupied by the troops of the
Combined powers, and 'erve as points to act
fr<?m according to circuinftances, while tire
fleets of England, Holland, and Spain are to
form a chain of cruizei? round the coast, rea
dy to favor the Royalists wherever they ap
pear, and to cut off all the supplies by fi?a, as
the armies wiII do by land. Thus attacked
and hemmed in on all fides, with a strong par
ty to ad against them at home, the Republi
cans, it is hoped, must be soon subdued.
The cessation ofboftilities was declared at
an end, and the a!l"Â»es immediately commen
ced their Operations.
Such we understand to be the plan agreed
upon at this memorable Cong/e r s, in the ex
ecution of which Great-Britain is toafiift with
all her forces by sea and land. Of its practi
cability we prefiime not to give an opinion ;
but from the condutt of the allies in other
cases, we have little doubt but that if the
garnfons on the French frontiers (hould fall,
the Auftrians will take pofleflion of French
Flanders, Lorraine, and Alsace. This being
accomplished, Pruilia will have an equivalent
in another quarter, and peace will be offered
to the French without much regard to what
form of government they may choose to efta
blifli.
EatriSt of a letter from Antwerp, dated
April 8.
u The Deputies put under arrest by Dunrnu
rier, and sent to prince Cobourg, are at Ma
eftricht âDumourier with young Egalite,who
now calls himfelf the duke de Chartres, and
his lifter Mariemoifelle D'Orleans, are at
Mons.
" The army which general Dumourier
lately commanded, is in the utmofl confufion,
and it is even said entirely dispersed, without
any regular leader. That General persua
ded himfelf, from the persona! attachmrnt
lhei.cn him by his a my, that he might pro.
mife himfelf their support, to the extent of
bis wilbes, in the project he had formed. He
was, however, miftakeu. He had advanced
as far as Cambray, on the wad to Paris,
when he found his army deserting him; the
artillery firft forfook him, then the national
guards. He then harangued the troops of the
line, who, in return, informed him, that, not
withstanding tbeir love to him as their ge
neral, and as a brave foidier they were deter
mined, to a man, neither to fight against their
country, nor to violate that constitution which
they had fwom to maintain.
" General Dumourier finding that he could
not depend upon the army, immediately set
Out with young Egalite at the head of two
regiments of horse, and took the road for
Mons. He Was, however, so closely pursued
by a party who followed him, that he was ab
solutely obliged to fight his way.
" It is said that Dumourier intends to re
cruit among the royalists, who now are very
numerous in France.
" The Auftrians have laid siege to Conde,
and expect to have made considerable pro
gress it] Fran<e before the end of fix weeks.
â¢' The French garrison that were in Bre
da have made a requisition to be allowed a
strong escort, left rhey should be murdered bv
the Brabantert, who are highly incensed a
gainst the French." '
Dumourier wrote from Mons, requeuing
permission to attend the Congress which was
refufed him.
General Valence was at Antwerp on the
day the Congress met, not as a member of it,
nor as a prisoner, but having gone thither
during the fu r penfion of hostilities. Our ac
counts do not (late on what motive.
The made of electing officers in the French
army which Dumouner in his letter, after
the battle of the 18th of March, propofeH to
suppress, has been the means of saving the
northern army to the republic. 'Had Du
monrier had the appointment of the officers
ever since he took the command, the army
would have gore with hiin. By the mode of
ele&ion they are worse ToMiers, but much bct-
Ur citiz'.ns.
BARCELONA, March I

ous to his departure for France, had proposed
to leave M. Durtabi/e in quality of Charge
d'Affoires, per interim, and MefTrs. Piivabri

prpvifionally to receive the two latter, but
rejected the former.âBy thcTe dispositions,
the French here are exposed to the insults of
the people, extremely irritated on account of
the tragical death of Louis XVI.

STATE PAPERS.
GENERAL DUMOURIER
TO THE
French Nation.
SINCE the Commencement of the Revolu
tion, I hare devoted myfclf td the main
tenance of the Liberty and Honour of the Na-
tion.
The fcrvices I rendered in the year 1791,
are the most memorable. Minister of Fo
reign A/fairs during three months, I elevated
and sustained (he dignity of the 1 rench name
throughout all Europe. I was calnmxtiaied by
an odious Cabal, by whom I was chargcd of ha
vingplundered fix millions of Livres, defined
for secret services. I have proved that of this
sum 1 did not expend half a million. v
Having quitted the career.of Politic*
the close of the month of June, I comman4eU a
small army in the Department of the Northâ
This DqÂ»artment 1 was ordered to quit with my
troops at the very time the Auftrians entered
in force that part of the Republic. 1 disobeyed
the order, fa ved the Department, and an attempt
was made to come on me by surprize, for the
purpose of conveying me to the citadel of Metz
where 1 was to be condemned by a Council of
War to fuffer death.
On the 28th of August, I took upon me, in
Champagne, the command of an army of twen
ty thousand weak, and wkhout either di
scipline or organization I arretted |jro
grefs of eighty thousand Pruflians and HeiÃans
and forced them to retreat after they had facri
ficed the one ha sos their army. } was then the
Saviour of France ; and then it was that the
most wicked of men, the opprobrium as French
men , in a word, Marat began to calumniate me
without mercy. With a part of the victorious
army of Champagne, and some other troops, I
entered on the sth of November, the Beigic pro
vinces, where I gained the forever memorable
battle of Jemappe ; and, after a fuccefTion of ad
vantages, entered Liege and Aix-la-Chapelle,
towards the close of that month. From that
moment my deftru&ion was resolved on ; and
I have been accused of aspiring, now te the ti
tle of Duke of Brabant,now to the Stadtholder
ship and again to the Di&atorfhio. To retard
and crufti my fiicceffes, the Minister Pache,
supported by the criminal faction, to whom all
our evils are to be ascribed, fuffered the vi&ori
ous army to want every thing, and succeeded in
diibanding it by famine and nakedness. The
consequence was, that more than fifteen thou
sand men were in the hospital, more than 25
thousand deserted through misery and disgust,
and upwards of ten thousand horses died of
hunger!!!
I transmitted to the National Convention ve
ry itrenuous remonstrances, which I followed
up by repairing in person to Paris, to engage
the LegiHators to apply a remedy to the evil.
They did not even condescend to read the four
memorials I delivered in. During the twenty
fix hours I spent at Paris, I heard almofl: e?ery
night bands of pretended Federates demand my
head; and calumnies of every as
well as menaces and insults followed me even
into the country house to which I retired.
Having delivered in my resignation, I was
retained in the service of my country, because
it was proposed to me to negociate the f'jfren
fion of the war against England and Holland,
which 1 had conceived as indispensable to the
fafety of the Netherlands. Whilil I negotiated
and that fuccefsfully, the National Convention
itfelf hastened to declare war, without making
any preparations and without either power or
means for its support.
I was not even advised of this Declaration,
and learned it through the medium of the Ga
zettes pnly. 1 hafttned to form a small army
of new troops, who had nevfer fought, and
with these troops, whom confidence rendered
invincible, I made myfclf miller of three strong
places, and was ready to penetrate into the
middle of Holland, when I learned the disaster
ot An-la-Chapelle, the railing of the siege of
Maeflricht, and the fad retreat of the army.
By this army I was loudly summoned. I aban
doned my conquests to fly to it* fuecour ; Mttt
considered that we could be extricated from our
difficulties by a speedy fu.cefs only. I led my
companions in arms to the enemy. On the i6th
of March I ha/1 a considerable advantage at
Tirelemont. On the iÃth I brought the enemy
to a general a&ion ; and the centre and right
wing under my charge were victorious. The
left wing after having attacked imprudently,
fled. On the 19th we retreated honourably,
with the brave men that were left together, for
a part of the army disbanded itfelf. On the
1 ill and lid we fought with the fame courage,
and to our firmnefs was owing the preservation
of the remains of an aftny which breathes solely
for true Liberty, for the reign of the Laws,and
for the extinction of Anarchy.
It was then that the Marats, the Roberlpierrs,
and the criminal fe<9s of Jacobins of Paris, plot
ted the fall of the Generals, and more tfpecially
of mine. These villains, bribed with the gold
of foreign power, to cnmpleat the disorganiza
tion of the armies, caused almost all the generals
ti be arretted. They keep them in the jails of
Pans, to Septemberize them ; for thus it is
that those monsters have Coined a word, to
hand down tÂ« posterity the remembrance us the
horrid massacres of the firft fa days of Septem
ber.
Whilst I was employed in re-compoCng the
army, in which employment 1 laboured night
and day, on the ill of April (yesterday) four
commiflionen. reached me with a decree, pur
porting that 1 Ihould be brought to the bar of
the Convention itfelf. The War Miniiler,
Boumonrille, my pupil, was weak enough to
accompany them, to fucceeil me in my com
mand. The persons who were in suite of these
perfidious er.iiflaries, informed me themselves,
that different groups of aflaffins, cither fugi
422
tires from or driven out of my army, were dis
persed on the raid to kill mc before I could
r.ach Pari*. 1 spent fcvcral hours in endeavor
ng to convince the commilEoners of the impru
dence of thisarrcft. Nothing could (hake their
prida, and I therefore arreted the whole of
them, to fcrre nx;M the crime*
of Part.. I â¢hh the Impe
rialilb a fufpenfibn Â«T *rtwÂ» and mythed to
wards the capital, to extinguiA, at fooa aipof
fible.the lighted tmkeh of civil war.
My dear countrymen ! it is expedient that a
tree and brave mu remove from you the veil
which covers all our crimes and misfortunes â
In * 789, we made great efforts to obtain Liber
ty, Equality, and the Sovereignty of the People.
Our principles were consecrated in the Declara
tion of the Rights of Man, and there have re
sulted from the labours of our LegiQators, ift.
the declaration which fays that France is and
shall remain a Monarchy; idly, a Constituti
on to which we swore fealry in 1789, 90,
and 91.
This constitution might, and indeed mud
have been imperfeA ; but it ought and might
have been believed, that with time and experi
ence its errors jvould be rectified, and that the
necessary ltrifi: between the Legislative and
Executive powers would establish a wife equili
brium, which would prevent cither of these
powers from feiking the whole of the authority,
and attaining despotism. If the difpotifm of a
single individual is dangerous to Liberty, how
much more odious must be that of 700 men,
many of whom are void of principles, without
morale, and who have been able to reach that
lupremacy by cabals or crimes alone I
Licentiousness and excess fooa rendered it
impofiiblc to support the yoke of a constitution
that gave laws. The tribunes influenced the
afiembly of reprf Tentative s, and were themselves
awed by the dangerous club of Jacobms of Paris.
The llrife between the two powers became at
length a daily combat, then was the equilibriarr.
destroyed. France ceafcd to have a king, and
the vi&ory of the ioth of August was foiled by
the atrocious ci imes of the firft days of Sep
tember.
All the departments, but more especially the
wretched city of Paris, were delivered up to pil
lage, to denunciations, proscriptions, and mafla
cres. No Frenchman, the afiaflins and their ac
complicesexcepted, had either his life or his pro
pel ty in fecunty ! The consternation of slavery
was augmented by the clamorous orgies of vil
lains. Bands of pretended federates ran thro*
and laid wade the departments ; and of the
700 individuals who composed thisdefpotic and
anarchial body, 4 or 500 groaned and decreed,
and decreed and groaned, exposed to the exter
minating swords of the Marats and Roberffi
erres. It is thus that the unfortunate Louis the
16th perilhed, without a judicial trial and with
out a tribunal; and 'tis thus that the decree of
the 19th of Nov. has provoked all nations by
holding out to them our aid, provided they will
disorganize themselves. 'Tisthus that the un
just and impolitic decree of the 15th of Dec. has
alienated from us the hearts of the Belgians,
has driven us from the~ Netherlands lind would
have brought about the massacre of the whole of
our army, by this nation, provoked at our out
rages and our crimes, if 1 had not saved that ve
ry army by my proclamations. *Tis thus that a
decree established the bloody tribunal which
which places thÂ« lives of the citizens at the mer
cy of a small number of iniquitous judges,with
out recourse or appeal to any other tribunal.
*Tisthus that during the last month all the de
crees have been marked by the (lamp of infaria
ble avarice, by the blindest pr .de and more espe
cially by the delire of maintaining power, by
calling to the most important posts Â©i the ft ate
no other than d?ring, incapable and criminal
men, by driving away or murdering men en
lightened and of a high chara&er, and by sup
porting a phantom of a republic which their er-
rors in administration and in policy, as well as
their crimes, had rendered impra&icable. These
700 individuals despise, detest, calumniate and
revile each other, and have already, and that
frequently, thought of poignarding the one the
other. At this moment their blind ambition
has impelled them to coalesce afrefh ; and bold
criminality allies itfelf to feeble virtue, to pre
serve a power as unjust as it is unileady. In
the mean time their Committees devour every
thing, that of the National Treasury absorbing
the public funds, without being able to render
any account of the expenditure.
What has this convention done to maintain
the war it has provoked again 11 all the powers
of Europe ?
It has disorganized the armies, instead of re-
inforcing and recruiting the troops of the line,
and the ancient battalions of national volunteers
which would have formed a refpeilable army,
Instead of recompensing these brave warriors
by promotion and praises, these legifiators have
left the battalions incomplete, naked, di farmed
and discontented. In the fame way have they
treated the excellent cavalry : and the brave
French artillery is in the fame manner exhaufl
ed, abandoned, and in want of every neceffa-
ry. They notwithstanding create new corps,
ccmpofed of the iatellites of the ad of Septem
ber, and commanded by- men who hava never
served, and who are in no other way to be diÂ«a
ded unless by the army they surcharge aod dis
organize. The convention facrifices every thing
to these satellites of tyranny, to these cowardly
headloppers. The choice of officers, and that
of adminifixators. are in every particular the
fame; we fee throughout the tyranny which
flatters the wicked, because the wicked alone
can support tyranny . And in its pride and its
ignorance, this convention orders the connuell
anddiferganization of the whole Univerft; it
fays to one of its generals, Go and take Rome,
and to another, fully forth and fubduc Spain',
to the end that defpoilipg coniniiffioiiers, simi

of a virtuous man, who truly loves hi- coun

procuring for it the happiness of a conftitutiofl

sovereigns whom foroc fadbou* perfaEs have ar

Filled at this moment with esteem for the
bulk of so great and so generous a nation, to
whom the immutable principles of honor and
justice were held sacred, until by the repetition
of outrages, difordens afid impolhires, that part
of it has been estranged and corrupted, which
under the maflc of humanity and of patriotism,

Knowing also that this is the wi(h of all vir

Profoundly penetrated with these great truths
mddeQring nothing but the prosperity andglo
j of a country torn by so many convulsions &
misfortunes:
I declare by the present proclamation, that I
will support by all the force Â«n my power the ge
nerous ar.d beneficent intentions of the gene
ral in chief Dumourier, and his br ve army.
I declare besides, that having lately fought us
on several occasions as a gallant, intrepid and
generous enemy, I will join a part of my troops,
Ihoijldgenerat Dumourier desire it, or even all
mr army to that of France, to co-operate a*
friends and companions in arms worthy of rer
ciprocal e eem, so as to restore to France her
constitutional king, the constitution (he has cho

of perfecting it, if the nation fnould fine? it im
perie<sl; thus to restore to France, as well as to
the rell of Europe, peace, confidence, tranquil
lity aÂ«d happiuefs. I therefore declare on my
word of honor, that I willnot enter the terri
tory of France to make conquests, but limply
and purely for the purposes above mentioned.
I further declare upon my word of honour,
that should the nvlitary opjrations require one
or more fortre lies to be given up to my troops,1 will kefp them marely as a (acred truth, and
I engage in the mofl express and positive terms,
to restore them,as fDon as the government which

Thk PRINCE DI COBOURG.
TheMirefchal Prisce of Saxe Cobourg, Gene
ral and Commander in Chief of the armies
of his Majesty the Emperor, and of the Em-
pire, to the French.
The Declaration which I made from my head
quarters at Mons, dated the sth of April 1793
is a public testimony of my personal fentimencs
to reftsre as soon as poflible,peace and tranquil
lity to Europe. In it I manifeited in a sincere
and open manner, my particular <4efire that the
French nation might have a solid and durable
government, founded on the unihaken basis of
julticcand humanity, which might ensure peace
to Europe, and happiness to France.
Now that the result of this declaration is so
opposite to the effe<sU it ought to have produced
and which proves but too plainlythat the senti
ments which have dilated it have been misun
derstood, it only remains for me to revoke it
entirely, and to declare formally, that the llate
of war which fubfifls between the court of Vi
enna and the combined powers and France, is
from this moment unhappily renewed.
I find myfelf therefore forced, by the predo
minating influence of the circumrtancesj which
the most guilty meil persist in dire&ing to the
overthrow and deftru<slion of their country, to
annul entirely my former declaration, and to
make known that a state of war so unfortunate,
being renewed, I have given the neceflary or
ders for commencing it, in concert with the al
lied powers, with all the energy and vigor of
which victorious armies are capable.
The celTation of the armistice is the firfl hof
tileftepthat the unfortunate combination of e
vents has forced me to make. There will there
fore only subsist, of my former declaration, the
inviolable engagement, which I again renew
with pleasure, that the most exact discipline will
be observed and maintained by my army upon
the French territory, and that every breach
thereof willbepunifhed with the utmost rigor.
Thefincerity and loyalty which at all times
have been the principle of my anions, oblige me
to give to this new address to the French nation
all the publicity of which it is susceptible, to
leave no doubt of the consequences thafnayre

men of principles unfit to obtain property or

times than their own conduct and principles.
Vet some of this description are the noisiest
clamorers for a fuper;or purity in the admi

done is good enough to suit them. They are
afraid of bad principles creeping into the ad
ministration of the government. Why lhould

The opinion oi the Frefident of the United

" I believe the American Museum has met

opinion, that the work, is not oniy eminently

EXTRACTS,
Written in 17.90. â Travjlalcdjrom ike French.
THE expedient of arming the
poor figainli the rich, isas absurd as
execrable. Want and necefiity have
created more ties between the rich
and the poor, than philosophy can
eafity difiolve. It is necefiity which
makes the multitude of poor per
ceive, that they could not exifl with
out the feyfr rich ; it is the fame pro
vident neceflity which forbids the
ivy from ftifling with its thousand
arms the oak which supports it and
saves it from creeping on the ground.
THE true philosophy of a people
is policy ; âand while philosophy
teaches to fonie individuals retire
meut, the contempt of riches and
honor ; policy dictates to nations to
enrich themlelves at the expense of
their neighbours, to cover the seas
wirh their navies, and obtain by
their industry and activity a prefer
ence in all the markets ot the uni
verse ; for two nations are to each
other in a state of pure nature, like
two savages contending for the
fame prey., â¢
THE experience of part ages
proves, that whenever the people
have exetcifed in theinfelves the
three powers, the democracy is im
mediately changed into anarchy ;
violent oiatots agitate the multi
tude as the winds toss the waves ;
and the people flattered by dema
gogues, have committed all the eJÂ£-
cetfes, abrogated their best laws,con
demned their best citizens, and dis
sipated the public revenues. In
Athens, the sovereign was mad,and
the state miserable.
This experience of all ages fur
ther proves, that if the three pow
ers are united in the hands of a se
nate or an individual, there is im
mediately an ariftocraticai or a mo
narchical despotism.
To obtain therefore, a tolerable
eonftiftution, the fovereigury mtrlt
divide ifselfâBut flow experience
has at length come in aid of rea
foti, and has (hewn that whenever
only two bodies are eftabliihed as
the depofitai its of power, they are
neceflarily engaged in a combat,
which mufl finifii in the extinction
of one or the other, and the deltrmic
tion of the public happiness. When
Rome had banished her kings, the
senate took their place, and govern
ed like despotsâuntil at length the
people by frequent infurr6ifHons
compelled them to acknowledge
the magifhacy of the tribunes.
From that moment peace was ba
nilhed front Rome ; the tribunes in
their turn, having gained the victo
ry over the fenare,deflroyed liberty,
and violenily led the Sovereign Peo
ple to slavery.
THE word Liberty will always be
an enigma while we tlifcern in it
aÂ»y thing more than the work of
the law, and the fruit of the consti
tution ; while we compound it with
natural independence, we are A ill
in want of a good 'definition of li
bertyâTo undei ftai>4, it we mult
enquire what are the elements of
liberty. It seems to me that man,
when he exchanges the condition in
which nature places him, to become
the social being, loses his indepen
dency to acquire greater security.
Liberty then is the rcfuit uj a ct/itruil
b.tvjccn iiidepcuJente and JteurlTj.
Man quits his companions of the
woods, who do not disturb him, but
who may devour him, to enter into
a society which will not devour him,
but inult ueceflaiijy conltrain him.
âHe makes the belt bargain he can, I
and when he enters into a society
who have a good constitution, iie
(urrendeis as little of his indepen
dence, anil obtains as great (ecurity
as poilible. It is like a ship, which
we get insured oil leaving our fltores,
of which, for the fertility of the
whole, we voluntarily rt-linquifb
pan of the profits. With this defi
nition of liberty, we may explain
all the phenomena presented to us
in ancient or modern history. At
Rome and Athens, for example, in
dependence prevailed over I'ecurity.
In a monarchy like England, fecu*
rity prevails over independence.
