Jiiin.anUy was alone obeyed. The doors of our
â¢ hmi'es were ibrown open, and crowds annulled
without any torm or cetemorrv by which to
minib<r them. Th<Â» committee appointed to
recelvÂ©Conjrnbuppns and provide accommoda

merable obj< Â£ls of diltreTa, and in the firlt in
ftanec, bellowed all their attention on merely
procuring them fhcltcr. We have now adopted
a fyficm tn the buftnefc, and in a,lew days we
hone to give you fatisfa&ory information to
every point of enquiry*. Fortbq prclent we will

The number .of, (bjps arrived in this harbour,
is about 49, and the white p' ffengers we suppose

others are hourly arriving, and or the
that proceeded to Norfolk, not more than 306
can he aeeommodated,and the remainder wc arc
informed are on their way to thiÃ town ; of
thole arrived here, about 400 are accommodated
in private families acting from motives of bofpt
tality and charity, and 6co are dependant on
tin. ncrops contributions of the town. The
sum raised bv fubfeription does not exceed
jk o dollars ; from this efttmate you must rea--
'di'?*\>nceive that our fund cannot lohg fultaih
the "heavy draughts that, are continually made

FOR THE GAZ'EtTE.
WHILE every citizen of a free govern,
ment claiiuslhe privilege of thinking
as he pleases r and of publ lbing his thoughts
to the world, he must expert that the red of
the community will also exercise their â  ight of
judging as they p!eafie of his opinions, his mo
tives and hmifelf.âl further rake it fdr
granted that every Printer in some measure,
holds himfelf responsible for the opinions pro
pagated from his pi els, and in this view may
be adverted ijpon as thej ; " authorâthey are
at least hi< adopted child;etÂ».âWho then is
the Editor of the " Nutioac/ Gazette, '* that takes
the liberty upon every occasion, both trifling
and not to examine with candor
and decency into the conduct of our fifft ma
giftralev but to-cast et him the rr.cil illiberal
and unwarrantable abufeâlts absurdity de
serves to be hooted at, and its impertinence
punilhed. The President iifues a ?rocla'ma
l tion, in virtue of his executive authority, to
advise the people of their situation, which is
1 to tb'em a new one, to preserve the peace of
I the country, am! dec/Fare it's Jaws; fdr Jobbt
, less while there is n6 declaration of war by
* the proper authority, it is jshe law of the
Union that we should reniain in peace. It
matters not how just or how giorious the
cause of France isâit matters not how we
mar 5e bound in gratitude or in any other
way, even'by treaty itfelf, to aflift her ; while
the'confritutiortal authority has not positively |
and eMplicitry enlisted in the contefl, it is the
duty of the executive to use all means
r to keep the neutrality inviolate.âAs to the
( president's tight to ilfue such a Proclamation,
I will fÂ«sy, that not only he, but any other ci
lc tisen has a right to publtfli every fentinient
a ccntÂ»in.ed in it ; and whether it is done un
fl' der form of a Proclamation, or uncU-r any
{. otter fpnp is not very material. j
vÂ« â¢ *it ;o;ues with more and I ho^e
s n .:
with more efF?#, from Him than from any
body else JSo that, if this Proclamation cl'aiilisi
no authority* she right to promnlge it cannot
be cjneftioneu-âlt is hot pretended that
wou'd be criminal to disobey it as me Prifitiett's
Proclamation, although it inigrrr, 3s being ,an
exposition of the law of the countryâthe
breach of which is undoubtedly punifliable.
The President js charged Atith havinjr "exceed
ed his authority in this and
yet he is censured for not t a more
â¢ 4 alive jtarf."âNow fprelv Ins authority does
not depend upon the fide he take-iâis there
lore he excetds his authority In a ftmpje
word of caution and adv ce to his country-'
Men, who depend upon him for ftich

which have been entruttert
after having loil the confidence of

with him the most disagreeable and

Saturday the a7ih of April, brought
Hie to a trial before them, giving
me as antagonist, Lieutenant Col.
Offenftein, one of the leafl refpetft
able ftibjeAi of the Republic.
" At present after returning from

to interpret, my exprellions, 1 an
swered with all that moderation
which the commilfionfrs had a right
to expert ; but when one of them,
whom the re it applauded, accused
me of having difplaj ed in that let
ter sentiments unworthy ofa repub
lican, i can no longer after such an
injury continue to command the ar
mies of the Republic.; and for its
interell, I request that you will ap
point some one to fncceed me, for
I cannot command the French trooj>s
â¢fter their delegates announce to
e tbatthey refufeme their ePceem ;
I it would be dillionoring the
to which your confidence raised

I fhuuid retain an office in which
such language would deprive me ot

" 1 lie character which I had e
\er before the States General, the
opinions which at the epoch were
iii me the result of long experience,
and of mature oblervaiion, inade in
the midst of courts (an experience |
and obfervaiions which g<*Â»e rile to
my republican principles) are the
Tame at piefent ; but as they
the result of principles long.ago
deeply studied, they have not pro
duced that exageration which makes
font* ilefpife all kings, becaufethey
have had the misfortune to be born
on the throne.
" 1 beg the representatives of the
people to remember, that 1 demand
ed ifie reiteration of a villain ; and
tlvat 1 was not limiting an eulogium â ,
but 1 will again repeat, let imparti
al men read my letter, and they
will fee whether 1 offer incersfe to
the virtues of the king of Pruljia â
On the contrary, tliey will
that 1 hope not to be compelled to
pronounce opinions so unfavorable
to him, as those which would be ex
cited in my mind by his granting
protection so traitors.
I fball not here mention tbe harsh

44 This Peace appears very mysterious to
meâl suppose it is a temptation held out to
Prufiia by the Spanifli Court, to join the con
federacy of despots aga nft the French.
44 Should the Portuguese be so happy as to
obtain a peace with the Algerines, what
would be the fatal confequtfnce to the Anie
rican commerce? A inoft tempting argument
has been held out to the Regency here, by the
Spanish Consul, namely, that they would be-
makers of the great ft#, as no maritime
power would then be capable of prevent ng
their cruizersfrom visiting the Atlantic ocean,
whenever they thought proper.
14 We are daily expe&i-g to hear foine
thing from America lelating to a peace ; â'
the sum has been a r certained fmce last April
by MeliVs. Bnfhara and Diainio, and I hope
Congress will take this matter into their nioft
ferjous jponfideratior!â-ll* .the terms are re
