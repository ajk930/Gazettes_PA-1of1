ANOTHER important inference to be no
ted i*, that the powers of making war and
treaty being fub&mtVify of a Utgiflative, not
an executive nature, the rule of interpreting.-ex
ceptions fttiiftly, muft> narrow inftehd. of en
larging executive pretentions on those fuhje&s,.
3, It remains to tye enquired whether there
In? any thing in the constitution irfelf which
fl'.ews that the ot makiug war and peace
are confidsretf as of an executive nature, and
s*s comprehended within a<general grant of exe*
C utive power.
Ic will not be-pretended that this appears from
any dircÃ petition to be found in the inftruntent.
If it were dcJucitle from any particular ex
p reffious it may be prefumusd that the pubHca
ti on would have saved us the trouble of the re
i't ;arch.
Docs the do4lrtne then tefult from the a An
al distribution of powers aniaug the fcveral
branches of the government ? Or from any fair
ai lalogy between the powers of war and treaty
ajad the enumerated powers veiled in execu
te iVe alone ?
Let us examine.
In the general diftrihution of powers, we
f ipd that of declaring war exprÂ«Â£sly veiled in '
Ihe Congress, where every other legislative
j >ower is declared to be veiled, and without any
other qualification than what is common to ev
{â¢â¢ry other legislative a&. The constitutional
idea of this power would seem then- clearly to
fctt, that it-isol a legiilative and not an exec ac
tive nature.
This' cbncluGon become* irrrfiftable, when
Jl: is recollecfted, that the contention cannot be
si jppofed to hive placed either any power legi
j) ative ill its nature, entirely among executive
j .owers, or anypower executive in its nature,
Â« nriieiy among legiflativepowers, without char
-5 'Uijj the constitution, with that kind of inter
mixture and eotnfoiidation of different powers,
vhich Would viola.'a a fundamental principle in
the organization of free governments, If it
i vere not unnecessary to enlarge on this topic
I lere, it could be (hewn, that the constitution
1 vas originally vindicated, and has been con
-1 iaatly expounded, with a dUavowal of any fucb
1 nrerniixture.
The power ol treaties is vefled jointly in
I he Prelidcnt and *. the Senate, which is a
(branch of the legifl'tire, From this arranÂ£e
jmcnt merely, there N can be no inference that
1 votild ceceffintfp Â«;:cl*dje the power from the
i xzcutjre clÂ»fs i liuce t!se filiate iÂ» joined with
J'ttcPi fi'li it in another wower, that of appoint
ing to offices, which as far as relate to exetu
ti ve offices at ieart, is considered as of au exe-
Ci .tive natiire. . Yet on the other hand, there
it t fufficicnt indications thtit the power of trea
ties w regarded by the constitution as jiiateriat
ly different ii winners Â«xacu.tLÂ»e power, and as
viqg more affinity to the legislative than to
t"( . executive charactcr.
Onecircumftance indScatiug this, lsthe'con
fllttitional regulation under which the fen-ate
I ive their .content in the cafe of treaties. In
a il other clrfe* the eoÂ»*fent of the tyody is exprcf
i;<l by a majority of vuicci. In this particular
c ale',' a c incurrence of two thirds at least is
s vide insceflary, as a substitute or compensation
the other branch of the tagiflature, which
on certain occasions, codlJ not be conveniently
a party to the tramÂ£i&ion.
But the coiuciufivfe tinea raftaziee is, that trea
ties according to the eonftitirtion
4it mode, ;ire coufeflcdly to have the force and
â¢operation of laivs y and are to be a rule for the
courts ui controyeifics between man and man,
as much as anv othe- laivs. They are even em
phatically declared by the constitution to be
gt the foprcflTic law of the land.'*
So far tht; argument from the constitution is
precifeiy in oppoQtitm to the dosrine. As lit
tle will be gamed in its favour fropi a compa
rison of the two powers,with those particular
ly veiled in the President alone.
As there are bat few it wifl tie most fatisfac
tnry to review them one by one.
4t The President shall be commander in chief
of the army and navy of the United States,
anÂ»d of the militia when called into the a&ual
lcrvice of the United States."
There can he no relation worth examining
between this power and the general power of
makiijg treaties. .'And instead of being analo
gouÂ«to the power of declaring war, it affords
a striking i!luft?atien of the incompat bility of
the two powers in the fame hands. Those who

is, of determining what the laivs jhull be with â , , â
r;gard t,O other nations? No other certainly
th.m what subsists between the powers of exe
cuting and enadfcing laws ; no other, conse
quently, than what foftuds a coalition of the
poweis ill the lame department.
I the few other fpecifieji fundb'ons
a Signed-to the Prciident, such as that of, con
vening of the liigiftUtu'e, &c. &c. which cannot
be drawn into the present question.
It may lie proper however to take notice of
the power of removal from office, which ap
pears to have been adjudged to the President by
the lawseftabliftring the executive departments;
and which the- writer has endeavoured to press
intohis fcrvice. To jufciiy favourabij in
feregce from this cafe, it must be (hewn, that
the powers of war and treaties are of a kin
dreds nature to the power of removal, or at
least are equally within ,a grant of executive
power. Nothing of this fort has been attemp
ted, nor probably will be attempted. Nothing
can in truth be. clearer,, than that no analogy,
or shade of analogy, can be traced4>etwccn a
power in the iupreme officer responsible for the
faithful execution of the laws, to displace a fiib
altera officer employed in the execution of the
laws; and a power to make treaties, and to de
clare war, such as these Aave been foundto be in
their nature, their operation, and their conse
quences. /
Thus it appears that by whatever standard we
.try this do&rine, it mull be condemned is no
less vicious in theory than it would be dange
rous io pra&ice. his countenanced neither by
the writers on law; nor by the nature of the
powers themfelyes ; nor by any general arrang
n.ents or exprefli on 6, orplaufible a
nalogies, to be found in the conilitution.
Whence then can the writer have borrowed
it ?
There is but one answer ta this question.
The power of making treaties and the pow
er of deflating war, are royal prerogatives in the
Britijh govit'nmenti and are accordingly treated
a.3 Executant prerogatives by Britijh comjrcntators
We shall be the more confirmed in the neces
sity of this solution of the problem, by looking
back to the aera of the confbtutiea, anÂ«i Satisfy
ing ourjwlves that the writer could not have been
milled by the do&rines maintained by our own
commentators on our own government. That
I may not ramble beyond prescribed limits, I
ihall content myfelf with an extra<sl from a
work which entered into a systematic explana
tion and defence of the constitution, and to
which frequently been a fori bed some*
influence iii conoiliaxing the public affant to the
government in form proposed. Three cir
ciiqaftancen conspire in giving weight to this co
temporary e&p/6fition. It was made at a time
when no application to persons or measures could
btas: The opinion given was not transiently
mentioned, but formally and critically elucidat
ed : It related to a point in the constitution
which must consequently have been viewed as
of importance in the public mind. The paflage
relates to the power of making treariÂ«s ; that
of declaring war, being arranged with fwch ob
vious propriety among the legillative powers,
as tobepaffed over without particular difcufiion.
" Tho* ftveral writers on the fub>jc& of govern
" ment place that power sos making treaties Jin
the class of Executive authorities, yet this is
'â¢ evidently an arbitrary dijpojttioti. For ifweat
*i tend carefully, to its operation, it wiil be
" found to partake more of the leg'Jlative than
" of the executive chafer, though it does not
Â« feemftri&ly to fall within the definition of
" either of them. The eifence of the legisla
tive authority, is to ena& laws; or iti other
u words, to prescribe rules for the regulation
u of the society. While the execution of the
u laws and the enaoloyment of the common
" strength, either for this purpose, or for the
* common defence, feent to comprize all she
" fun&ions of the Executive magi/irate. The
" power of making treaties is plainly neither
" the one nor the other. It relates neither to
" the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to
â¢' the enaitiou of new ones, aadftilllcfs to au

EXETER, (N.H.) August 13.
At a legal meeting of the qualified vo

the I2ih of Arignft, 1793,
Voted unanimously, Tbat when un
principled or misguided men are, by their
machinations, endeavouring to interrupt
the public tranquillity and happiness, it
becomes the duty of the friends of peace
and good orJer to pursue all proper mea
sures for rendering their plans abortive.
Voted unanimously, That although we
> feÂ«l ourselves of comparatively small im
portance,both in a political and commer
cial view, we have a common interelt with
out fellow citizens through the Union in
the piefervation of peace and prosperity,
which we now enjoy ; and therefore es
teem it no less our right than our duty to
express our sense of common dangers, and
our ideas of the means pursued for the
public security.
Voted unanimoufly,that in our opinion
the public measures, which have betn a
dopted by the President of the United
States, for maintaining, during the pre
sent war in Eucope, that ftri& and impar
tial neutrality, with which both our na
tional interell and honour are so intimate
ly conrte&ed, were conftitutiorial, wife,
and patrioticâand that we view, with
great indignation, the illiberal attempts
which have been made to calumniate his
official chara&er on account of tins time
ly discharge of an important duty.
Voted unanimously, That as we ate at
peace with all the powers of Europe, we
cannot but confidet every citizen of the
United States, who is interested in fit
ting out, or concerned in manning, any
armed vessel to cruise againit their pro
perty on the high seas, or who advocates
such measures, as guilty of a species of
mafqued piracy, highly dishonorable to

intemperance, but to use fermented liquors,

FROM THE NEW-YORK DIARY
Gentlemen,
AN Offker of the Jupiter has it in command
from me to hand you this denial of certain pas
sages which have \ately appeared in yonr gazette.
I owe it to truthâto myfelfâto the error into
which certain French republicans have been
diawnâind final to tn tfie honor of the fcr
viceofthc French Republic, which Oiall never
perifb in my hands, through want of zeal to
maintain it.
The articles arrâ ift. u The C/impany of
Jupiter have on jufl grounds of fvfbitfon arrejled
their commander Admiral Cambis.âvA. <4 The men
accufej Cambh of being the csvfe of the troubles at the
Cape." [vSee I ast Gazette ]
Tbrfe articles are not figned.â-Methinks,Sir? #
Vour delicacy tyufl have been wounded by puh
tlifhing, during mv scandalous confuieinen l , re
flexions and layings concerning; me without at
the lame time exposing to public view the in
famous and bafc authors of tbefe calumnies, and
of the momentary deception of my companions
in arms
While American generosity will revolt a? the fe
daflardly manoeuvres, it will, 1 trust, applaud
me for addrefling you, for the last time, thele
few lines.
The connexions which I have been under a
neceflitv of maintaining with Galbaud, aie of a
nature so frandalous for a man who preserve* aoy
eftcem for himfelT, that I am less fol'citous to
lay them before the public, than to verify them
befoie the tr ; bunals appointed to take judicial
cognizance of them.
I exprft from your candor, an early publi-<
cation of this letter.
Rear-Admiral CAMBIS.
Aboard the Jupiter, 23d" August, I 793 >

From the Baltimore Daily Reposi tory
Messrs. Printers.
A Customer to your ufeful paper , willies
for information from some of your learned
correspondents, on the following fnl jefl
By the'law of nations, and a special a<ffc of Con.
greft, the persons < f foreign ministers, con
suls, &c. are protected from arrests and ac
tions in certain cases, in which others are lia
ble to both. Does tlis privilege (ecu re ain
bafladors, envoys or consuls from* an
for defamation ? and if so, what remedy can
a calumniated person have for a mod atro
cious fallhood, propagated to his great preju
dice, by one who is recognized as a public
character ? A. Z.
The principles of the French Revolution
are the noblest that can give consolation or
hope to the heart of man. Emanating from
liberty, the birth right of all the descendants
of Adam, they must monopolize the affections
of every part of mankind. But American*
know, by experience, that like all sublunary
things, they aÂ»e "liable to abuse ; and their
prayers and wishes areâthat in the Gallic
Republic, the Goddess of Liberty may be
wedded to the Genius of Good Government,
and that Order, Equal Privilege l ;, Harmony,
and National and Individual Felicity, may be
the offspring of the allianceâand that not
only there, but that their residence may be
bounded only by the boundaries of the globe.
Let the high flying advocates of levelifm, pre
tend to a better wilh if they can !
We are happy to hear that the difordrr which
has prevailed in this city for several daysâbe
gins to abate.
An English veiTel was lately diverted of
cannon and warlike stores, at Charleston, S. C.
on iufpicion of being equipped as a cruiser.
Died, after a ftiwt illness, Mr. Samuel
Swan, brother of Caleb Swan, EfqâPavma
fterto the western army. Monday hisrcmairs,
attended by a number of citizens, were in
terred in the Prefoyterian burial ground,
Arcb-ftreet.
Peace to the hapless stranger's dust,
Whose foul reposes with the iuft.
May bleffingj on that man defbend,
Who prov'dhimfelf the ftranger'i friend.

Thomas Miller, worthy and refpeftable mer
