No- VII.
Tils civilization of the Indians is a fubjeft
so very important, and yet ft> little in
veftioated, that in the firft attempt to bring
it before the public, little more than an enu
meration of expedients can reasonably be
pefted. Let the following ohfervations there
fore be considered as intended to excite the
public investigation of the fubjeft, rather
than fts a regular and digested plan proper to
be carried into e(fe<ft.
The experience of past age;, and of na
tions in Ginilar circumstances, may serve to
guide our relearchas in this new and interest
ing inquiry.
Tn the history of the progress of nation?
from ivirb irifm to civility, we find that tn9
worfliip of the Deityâthe institution of mar
riage, and the eitablithment of private pro
pertyâhave entered into the foundation on
which the fuperftrufture of civil society has
b~Â«n trrefted. These are necessary to give
form an J permanency, to its establishment.
Each of these isofitfelf inefficientâit is their
union and joint influence, with the cffc&s
that naturally result from them, that give
lociety its perfect form. The investigation
of each of these principles which compose the
foundation of civil society, merits attention
in the divelopement of this fubjecl. Some
remarks upon the firft of them, will be the
substance of the present essay.
The idea of a Supreme Being, is either ori
ginally inftampt upon the human mind, or is
among the firft imprelfions whi,ch it receives
from theexercife of its own powers. All
men at times fee! their dependence upon a
Superior, and seek occasionally, by external
homage, to deprecate his anger and ferure his
favour. It is perhaps impoflible to efface this
impi eflion from the'human heartâit is the
Knjt which connects material with immaterial
existence. It is uncertain how far civil go
vernment would be practicable without the
aid of these sentiments. In its best form, it
is far from being a perfect work. The li
mited" eStertTÃf its law;âthe imperfection of
its fanftionsâthe inequalities and diftinftions
which it createsâwith the temptations to
fraud, injustice and cruelty, are calculated to
cxcite envy and inquietude in the minds of
the least fortunate members of the commu
nity; who, without the co-operation of reli
gious principles, would be continually endea
voring to throw off all legal restraint, and to
dissolve the bands of the society, in order to
riot on the spoils of the public, or to re eftab
lilh it on a foundation more agreeable to their
wishes and interests.
The belief of a Supreme Beingâinfinite in
power, wisdom, purity, justice and goodnessâ
of a future ftatcâof retributionâof an uni
versal judgment, and of an eternal award
penetrates the heart, arrests the eon faience,
and restrains the impetuosity of the paiHonsâ
It leads to obedience and submission, by an
nexing the idea of duty to the facrifices of
pcrfona! interest, to the present order o
things, and by the profpeft of a period whei
an equitable distribution (hall be made by thi
Sovereign of the Universe.
A rut by enforcing the rights of inipertfeft
obligationâ-by inculcating the exercise of the
fecial virtuesâby reftralning fscret crimesâ
by corroborating the authority of the laws,
and by giving additional energy to their fac
tionsâit is admirably calculated to remedy
the inconveniences, and supply the defclts of
civil government. These principles are Am
ple and uniform, adapted to every capacity,
find suited to every stage of society and age
of the world.
In rude and ignorant times, men not hav
ing compact of mind enough to trace these
impre'fions to their source, or to deduce all
things from one simple cause, followed tlie
impulf.- of their imaginations and their pas
sions, In this state of mens' minds, every
deviation from the ordinary coui'fe of things
alarms their fears, and they have recourse to
superior and invifihle powers to relieve them
from the evils which theydiead. They ascribe
to a diftinft cause every uncommon eventâ
sod by tbefe means, multiply their Gods with
out number. They clothe them with the
pafKons and weaknefles of mortals, and pay
them an homage that corresponds to their
origin and tlieir attributes. Men of superior
sagacity have availed themselves of this
weaknessâaugmented the reputation of tbe
cut rent superstitions, formed them into fyf
teni. and made them the bafu of their laws
and policy. The introduction of laws and
government in most nation-;, of whose origin
we have any diftinft tradition, was effe&ed
in this manner.
Tbe holy religion tlrat we poffbfs, is indeed
in every Ifneament different from the systems
of superstition wh'ch the ignorance and credu
lity of mankind have invented. The one lets
before uÂ» a ttandaid of perfect excellence,
which we are commanded at our peril to imi

tateâthe other clothes the ofcjifis of its wor
lhip with the frailties of men. The one in
fctfeft lends to putity and virtueâthe other,
to depravity and folly. What life may be
made of true religion in civilizing lhe Indians,
I will not pretend to determine âBut that it
may be of some service, I think evident. If
superstition and falle religion were found ne
ceffiry to the eftabliftlraent of civil fociery
and cvvjl lawsâPurely true religion is equally
nece!Tary, and will bÂ« equally eHeciu.il. Such
is the attachment qf the Indians to their man
ners and cuftoijiiâfach the ilrength aud vio
lence of tiieir paflions, and such the nature
and. number of their vices, that no change can
be introduced among them in these refpecls
but by interfiling the strongest paflions of the
human mind- No sentiments so easily rcach
the heart, and none so powerfully imp''efs the
mind, as thofe_ which relate to religion. The
doctrines, the precepts, and the institutions of
religion, are all calculated to enlighten, to
humanize and to interest the human mindâ
to foften the manners, and to extend and
Strengthen the social affe&ions.
No principle will be so efficacious in chang
ing the habits of the savages, as religionâ
This is evident not only from the nature of
tilingsâthe constitution of the human mind,
arid the power of superstition in pad agesâ
but from the experience we have actually had
of the ef&&s of it on the temper and manners
of the Indians.
The success of Mr. David Braincrd among
the Indian 1 ? in New-Jersey, has been laid be
fore the public. By the indefatigable exer
tions and well directed zeal of that pious and
judicious miiHonary, a considerable number of
the fa-vages. were prevailed on to forfake their
wandering way of lifeâto form them fir lyes
into a society, and to attend to agriculture.
He established a school among them, and the
youth made great proficiency even during his
residence among them.*
In the history of the Five Nation*, we are
informed that by the exertions of two suc
ceeding miflionaries, they were reformed in
a great measure from the vice of drunken
nefsâfrom the practice of divorcing each
other on frivolous pretence I !âfrom the exer
cise of cruelty to their prisoners, and in some
measure from their propenfrty to war.fâ,
From fucli favorable beginnings, what might
not he expected from a vigorous prosecution
of similar measures.
From these experiments we may infer, the
religion, pure, simple, and unadulterated by
superstitious ceremonies, or any falfe mix.
ture, would be a powerful inftrumeot in ef
fecting the civilization of our American In
diansâand a well digefled plan for this pur
pore deserves the patronage of the benevo

Yeflerdax afternoon, the citizens of Philadelphia,
agreeably to a notification for that purpose, at
tended a meeting in the State house garden. An
address congratulating Mr. Genet on his arrival
was read, and unanimoujly adoptedâlt was im

To Edmund Charles GENET, Minister Ple
nipotentiary i'rpm the Republic of France,
to the United States, âTHE ADDRESS ps
the Citizens qf Philadelphia.
S I R,
The Citizens of Philadelphia are anxious to
convey their congratulations upon your arri
val, in terms the raoft cordial and acceptable.
We have, with pleasure, on former occalions,
acknowledged our obligations, and declared
-our attachment to the people of France J but,
at this moment, we are peculiarly gratified,
by recognizing, in the Minister of our firft
and hell Ally, the representative of a Free
Re public.
Impressed with the value of our political
independence ; recollecting, with an honest
pride, tlie Glory and Success, which, in the
pui 'uit of that o"hjeÂ£t, crowned the virtue
and foititude of America; and ettimating
the prefer, t reputat on a.id prosperity of the
union, as blessings resulting from the Revo
lution ; we cannot without gratitude, consi
der, bow great a portion of our triumph and
our happmefs, was derived from the zealous
and dilinterefted aid of your countrymen ;
nor can we without diffiir.ulation, fupprels
our joy, that the cation, which so generously
contributed to relcue the liberties of America,
has, at length, with unpai allelled magnani
mity, effablifhed her own.
From such feelings, fir, we have been na
turally led to contemplate the druggies of
France with a paternal eye ; sympathizing in
all her calamities ; ard exulting in all her
405
successes r but there is another interest, the
of Freedom and Equality, which adds
to the force of our aitivtion;, arid rgndars
the caule of France important tq every re
public, and dear to all the human race.
Be allured, therefore, that jnftly regard
ing the cultivation of republican principles,
as the best fecuritv for the permanency of
our own popular governments, we reft our
favorite hopes, at this momentous erilis, 011
the conduct of France ; and, earnestly giving
to the national exertions our wishes and our
prayers, we cannot refill the plealing hope,
that although America, is not a party in the
ex'fting war, ihe may still be able, in a Bate
of peace, to demonstrate the sincerity of her
friendfhip, by affording very ul'eful afliltance
to the citizens of her filter republic.
The well-earned character of a republican
and a patriot, has enf'itred for you the warm
est fentimants of personal refpedtand esteem :
and, whiie the law of nations, and the rights
of treaty, give dignity and energy to your
oflicial ftatiors; the endeavors of the citizens
will nor, wetriift, be jneffeÂ£hial, in render
ing your reiidence in Philadelphia, agreeable
to you, and honorable to ourselves.

the Republic of France, to the Citizens of
Philadelphia.
CITIZENS,
IF gratitude be not acknowledged a virtue
imong the despots, it is evidently fnch a
inorvg freemen. Of this-truth I have re
ceived abundant proofs on my journey from
Cbarlefton tfl Philadelphia. In every pla(;e
tbe general voire of the people convinced me
in a most sensible manner of their real fenti
pients and sincere and friendly difpofitipns
towards the nation which I have the honor
to represent, and for the advancement of that
common cause which (he alone supports with
lb much courage.
Citizens, your address has completed my
fatisfaftion, and I alfure you that the dayyoitr
Brethren In France stall receive it wtil fee 4'
day of gladness to them. This I anticipate,
that from tbe effe.ft it has had upon rayfelf, it
will have the fame upon then), fgm those
wife and liberal those just and
excellent ideas which chara&erize it.
In my private capacity of a citizen, I am
highly flattered with the favorable opinion
yon have formed of me; and I promise to
make every exertion in my power to render
tnyfclf worthy of thjt good opinion, and to
jnftify the confidence my country has repo r td
in me. My conduit while among you ftiall
he to the heighth of our national political
principlesâAn unbounded openefs shall be
the constant rule of my intercourse with those
wife and virtuous men into whole hands you
haveentruftcd the management of your pub
lic affairs. I wili expose candidly to them
the great ohjefts on which it will be our bu
linefs to ddiberate ; and the common interest
oif both nations will, I have no doubt be the
cdmpaf's of our direction ; for without such a
gilide, what would become of both nations,
txpofed as we mutually are to there fentment,
the hatred and the treachery of all the ty
fHhts of the earth, who, you may reft assured,
Ate at this moment armed not only against
France, but against liberty itfelf.

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
March 24.
Dutnoyrier on the 12th in ft. -wrote a let'
ter dated Louvain, which it was not
thought prudent at the time to read-
It is as follows :
Citizen President,
THE fafety of the people is the
supreme law ; I havejuft aban
doned conquell almost certain, by
quitting the victorious part of the
army ready to enter into the heart
of Holland, to Apr to the support of
that portion which has experienced
a check, owing to physical and mo
ral causes, that I mean 10 devflope
with that franknefs which is more
than ever neceflary, and which
would always have tended to the
welfare of the Republic, if all her
agents had made use of it in the ac
counts they gave, and if it had been
liltened to with more complacency
than deceitful flattery.
You know,citizen representatives,
in what a dangerous llaie y f difor
" [Whole No. 424.]

iers who draggrd France rn the
brink of ruin, i his mjniffer aijd"
those officers have been changed ;
but far from punifliing them, Pache
and HalTenfratz have parted ro the
important station of heads to the
Paris police, and from that nipment
the capita] has seen renewed iri the
(treet Lombard, scenes of blood and
maflacre.
I presented to you, in the month
of December, in four memorials,
the grievances that ought to be re
d relied. 1 informed you of the on
ly mean? which could put a stop to
the evil, and give to our armies
iheir vigor, and to ourcaufe all the
jultice which ought to 'characterize
it. These memorials have been
thrown aside ; you are not acquaint
ed with themorder them to fye
presented to yon, you will there
firtd predicted whal lias lince hap
pened ; you will also in them find
the remedy ro the other dangers
which surround us, and pienace our
infant republic. The armies of
Belgia united in the countries of
Aix la Chapelle and Liege, have
there fuffeted every species of want,,
without murrquiiug, but continual
ly weakened by fitlfiiefs and con
jtant Ikirmifhes with the $nemy,Bt>d
by the desertion of many of the of
ficers and f>!diers to the amount of
half their origins,! llrength.
It is only lince General Buernon
ville is at the head of the miniltrjj,
that the wants of the army and re
cruiting begins to be thought of.
But he has been in lb fiiorc a time,
that we feel that spi
rit qJ which we have been the vic
tims. This was our fituation,when
on the firft of February ypu tho'c
it due to the honor of the nation to
declare war against England and
Holland. From this moment I bu
ried the remembrance o,f all toy
grievances ;âI no longer thought
of resigning, which you will find
mentioned in the memorials abeve
alluded to ; all my thoughts were
given to the fafety of my country.
1 endeavored to be beforehand wli'h
our enemies, and this reduced army
forgot all its fufferings to attack
Holland. While, with new troops,
just from France, I was taking Bre
da, Klundert, Gertruydenberg, and
was preparing to extend my con
quests, the Belgic army, under Ge
nerals remarkable for courage and
civifm, undertook the liege of Ma
eftricht.
Every thing was wanting for this
expedition, the new
was not yet on foot.âThe ancient
was bad in every view. Money was
plenty, but the new formseftabli/h
---ed at the national treasury prevent
ed the use of that money. I cap
not yet detail the immediate causes
of the check our armies expp
rienced.as I ain jufl arrived ; not only
they have abandonee! every hopepf
taking Maeltricht, but they have
fallen back in confufion and with
loss. The magazines of every kind
which were begun to be colle<n?d
at Liege, have /'alien into thehandt
of the eneiny, as well as part of the
field artillery and that belonging to
the battalions : Thij retreat jias
drawn on us new euemies, and here
| will develope lite cause of our
misfortunes.
There has e*er exifted,in human
events, a reward for virtue a
punifhtnem for vice. Private indi
viduals may escape the effects of
this providence, which n>ay be cjiij
fd what you pleale, because they
are ioipeiceptible points : but rffd
liiUory, and you will find that a peo
ple never escape it.
As long as our caofe was jh?t ps
juitice we the taemj :from the irome:ti that aiaricc am!
injustice became oar guides, we
worked our own dcftru<stion, and
oar enemies profit by our (aults.
Yon are flattered and deceived, 1
will endeavor to tear the veil si oni
before your eyes. 'be Belgians
have been made to fnfFer vrxanous
of everv kind ; the (acred rights of
liberty "hi<Â»e Uen violated as they
relate to them ; their religious opi
nions have been mfulted ; the Itir
niture of their churches has been
taken without neeeltity, bai with
indecency. Thc-ir charade; and
intentions have been fflifreprefeut
ed ; rlrr re-union *Â»l fii'iliault has
beep effect cÂ»l by uiawi violence, by
the sword and lire arms ; that of
fefuflels by a knot of men vvho could
cxiit bur in the tnidft of t*ouble,and ,
by a few blood th tfty individuals
uliembled to intimidate the citizens.
Look over the liiflory of the low
countries, you will find t hat the peo
pie are good, open hearted, coura
geous, and wuithy of treedoiSi.
The Duke of Alva, the moil ci uel
of the satellites of Philip 11. bad
18,000 executed by the band ot the
â hangman. The Belgians took ven
geance by a war of thirty yea_is,and
their attachment to the religion ot
their fathers, only could have bro't
them ag'iin under the Spanish yoke.
Your finances were exhausted
when we entered Belgia ; your coin
had difjppeared. C ambon, who
m&y be an honest citizen, but who
is far beneath the confidence you re
posed in him in financial matteis,
law no remedv but in the pofleliion
of the riches of that fertile country.
âHe proposed to you the fatal de
cree of the 15th December ; you
unanimously accepted it, and yet
every one of those among yon, with
whom I have conversed on tiie fub
jetft, told me he did not approve of
it, and that the decree is unjust.
One of my memorials was again ft
that decrree ; ic was not read in the
allembly. The fame Cambon en
deavored to render my remonftran
' ces hateful and criminal, by faying
from the tribune that I was placing
a veto upon the decree of the Aflein
bly : You confirmed this decree by
that of December 30th ; you di
rected your commillioners to fee it
executed ; by your orders the exe
cutive fem at leali 30 commission
ers ; the choice of them was bad,
excepting a very few honest men,
who are perhaps considered as of
doubtful principles, because they
endeavor to mitigate the odium at
tached to their functions. The ma
jOiiiyare madmen or tyrai ts, or
men without reflection,whom a bru
tal zeal always has led beyond their
duty. The agents of tyranny have
been scattered over the whole face
of Btlgia ; the military comman
dants in obedience to the decree,
have been obliged to employ, upon
their requifttion, the forces entrust
ed to them.âThese extortioners fi
nally exasperated the spirit of the
Belgians. Thence forward, fear,
perhaps hatred, have replaced that
'Ardial fraternity which accompa
nied our fii'ft fleps in Belgia ; and
at the moment of our change of for
tune our agents exercised their
functions with the jnoft excessive
injustice ami violence.
You have been mi (taken asm the
re-union to France of feyeral porti
ons of Belgia You thought that
union voluntary, becanfe you were
deceived by lies. From that moment
you thought it in your power to
take the fnperfluous plate from the
churches, to defray the exppnee of
the war. You then looked upon
the Belgians as frenchmen : but
even if they had been,you yet Iliould
have waited the voluntary giving
up of this plate ; y'onr taking it by
open violence hecame sacrilegious :
This is exa<Sly what has happened.
The prierts and monks' have taken,
ad vantage of. that imprudent aÂ«ftj
and then pfeached us up as pillag
ers io be avoided, and every whfire
the inhabitants armed agaiaft us.
Our's is not a war of ariftocrÂ»cy,foc
our rev.oluti<)n favors the inhabi
tants of the country, and yet that
description of people arm a
gainst us, and the alarm is founded
in all Quarters. It with them a war
of religion ; and with us a criminal
war. YVe are at this moment fur
rounded by enemies ; you will fee
it by the reports which i lend to
the miniiier of war, you will fee at
the fame time the firlt ineal'ufes 1
have been obliged to take to save
the French army, the national ho
nor, and indeed the republic.
Reprelen.atives of the nation, 1
call on your probity and the recol
lection of the importance of your
duties ; 1 call 011 the sacred princi
ples explained in the declaration of
the rights of man, and I wait with
hu patience your decision. At this
moment you hold in your hands the
faie of the empire, and I am per
fuaded that troth and virtue will
guide your decisions, and that you
will not fuffer your armies to be
flained by crimes and then become
the victims of those crimes."
Oitmoutier, informed that this
letter had been referred to the com
mittee of defence, requests the con
vention to come to no determinati
on upon it, until be has again con
ferred with the coramiiiioners to
Belgia.
[ i he above letter appears in the
Monjteur Uuiiierjeilt, a Paris paper
of the 25th of March, which menti
ons in a note, " That the letter had
not been read before the National
Convention, but printed and pub
lilhed in the Belgic provinces."]
March 23.
Letters were read from the admi
nilVration of the lower Loire. By
these letters of tjie 19th it appeai-s
that the rebels are masters of the
whole country round Nantes, which
city is in a manner besieged ; the
communications are interrupted â
they call for immediate aififtanceâ
they announce that the chief of the
rebels, the number of whom they
state at about 40,000, is one de la
Perriere, that he has Cent various
propolals to the city of Nantes ; for
he has declared not to acknowledge
the authority of the department
and of the dilhitft : he has much
threatened, if he is not assisted in
supporting a kind cf constitution
which he presented, in which he
calls for the difmilfion of the consti
tutional clergy and a diminution of
ta<es. The administrators promise
and Fwear to remain firm at their
post. They have resolved, as the
only answer to the rebels, that court
martials flvdl attend each body of
troops that should match against
them to judge those taken and im
mediately cause the sentence to be
executed.
March 24.
Tallier informed that the depart
ment of Dordogne had sent 1200
men againit them. Honorable men
tion of the zeal of this department
and the city of Bourdeaux was de
creed.
b'errand dated, that the frontier
of Spain was in a formidable itate
of defence ; but that it was other
wise with ours. The executive
council was directed to give an ac
count ot the situation of that im
portant frontier.
Maltinet communicated a letter
he received from Nantes, by which
it appears, that the communication
between that city and Antwerp is
reffored. The adminiltrative bodies
have disposed of detachments at:
different diltances ; they diretfed
the gullies and ditcher made in the
roads uy the rebels to be filled up.
Upwards of 1200 rebels have alrea
dy fuffered death, about the fame
number are in prison, and will not
delay experiencing the fame fate.
This info rmation gave the greatest
fatisfadiion.
Two letters were received from
the minrller at war. In the firft he
announces, that he is communicat
ing to the committee of general de
fence the dispatches which he re
ceived yelterday and this night from
gen. Dumourier, as well as the plans
concerted between the executive
council and the generalsâthey can
not be rendered public for the ge
neral goodâ it will fuffice te fay,
that Dumourier is making a retro
grade movement to get nearer to
the frontiers ; this measure has ap 7
peared to him iieceflary to reorga
nise the army which is in disorder.
By the second letter it appears
that Ciiftine has had a considerable
advantage over the PrufTians. He
beat thein in an attack they made
-406
on one of his posts ; ~1<! Frencl >
troops displayed adonithing intre
pidity every where they took from
ilie enemy forage and provifious.
LONDON, March 24
Medals are now distributing in
Paris, having on one fide the effigy
of Louis XVi. and on tlie other,
the words, 11 eft mort martyr.
The effects of 1 lie rMy declaration
publiflied by Louis Stanislaus Xa
vier, have begun to inanifeft them
selves in France precisely in the
manner that might have been ex
pected. No sooner was the absurd
inltrument made public, but ad
drefles were presented from various
quarters, demanding the trial and
punifhmeui of the unfortunate An
toinette. These miserable deluded
refugees fall into the purposes of
igalite, as fully as if they were his
pro felled and hired instruments.
April 3! The communication with
Ollend being once more open, in
telligence will be more frequently
received from the immediate feac
of war
The mails from Holland and Flan
ders arrived yellerday. The Ley
den Gazette mentions, that the in
tercourse being re-opened, they
have obtained French papers to the
18th, the day on which they ceased
to be forwarded to London. The
Bruflels Gazette is totally barren of
intelligence.
The late failures in the city which
by some persons have been attribut
ed, very falfely, to be the effects of
the war, are found to arise, on close
infpetftion, from connections with
the country banksâa growing mif
chief, which has long called for the
interference of the legislature to
check its progress.
Friday evening intelligence came
to Lloyd's, of eight Englifli mer
chantmen trading to the Levant
having been taken by French pri
vateers, in the Mediterranean, and
fix of them carried into Marseilles.
They are insured at 80, cool.
La Halle, where Dumourier was
encamped, according to the last ac
count, is a strong post a few miles
to the south of Brullels. It was the
fame place that Duke Albert made
a stand in the last campaign, to co
ver the retreat of the Court of Brul-
i'els.

Thursday night, and brings niofb
important intelligence. We under
lain! that Dumourier is arrived at
Lille with his forces, and that he
had scarce made his appearance,
before M. Bournonville and five
commissioners from the convention,
had come down with orders to bring
him up a prisoner to Paris. Dumcti
jier did not follow the example of
la Fayette ; he refilled the order of
the convention, and having felt the
pulse of his army, arretted the com
iniliioners, and sent them to the
prince of Cobourg, as liortages for
the fafety of the Queen and royal
family. He then proclaimed the
young Louis king, at the head of
the army, and sent a dispatch to
Paris, intimating his determination
to proceed immediately thither, &
support the claim of the Dauphin
to the throne of his ancestors, as
from the conduct of the convention,
he saw that France could only be
saved by a general refinance to their
horrid tyranny. Such is the report
that has come to our ears of this
important dispatch ; and which we
give literally as we have reteived
it. It is added, that in consequence
of the news of Dumoui ier's defeat,
and of the violent measures taken
by the convention, the tumult 111
Paris has risen to the molt extrava

mourning crape over it, was flying
in the llreets, and numbers of peo

Besides the above particulars, in

GRENADA, April 19.
This morning the Ichoouer Swift,
Capt. Ryal arrived here froin lo
bago, with the agreeable news of
the capture ot that island. Weharve
been favored with the following
particulars by Col. Bailiie.
On Sunday the 14th, at 2 o'clock,
a signal was made that an enemy s
fleet was off Courland, and in about
an hour afterwards the Trulty, and
the other veflcls in the squadron
came to anchor in the bay. Gen.
Cuyler immediately landed with
the troops consisting of 35Â® men i
and marched direcftly to Cinnamon
hill, where he halted,and dispatched
a flag of truce to the fort, to demand
the surrender of the island. The
governor returned for answer, that
they would hold out to the last ex
tremity. It was then determined
to carry the hill by storm, and the
recefl'ary preparation being made,
the troops marched at one o'clock
on Monday morning, taking the
road through the town of Port-Louis.
They were formed in two columns,
the one under the immediate com
mand of the General, the other led
by Major Gordon of the 60th.
The (iring began about 2 o'clock,
and continued obstinate lor about
three quarters ot an hour, when Ma
jor Gordon with the light infantry
entered the fort and made hinifelf
completely master of the hill.
At day-light the capture was an
nounced by holding the Union flag,
and firing the morning gun.
All accounts agree in bellowing
the highest encomiums on the cool
and determined courage manifefted
by the British troops on the orcafion ;
and the conduct of Major Gordon
in preventing the (laughter that al
most unavoidably follows a (lorm,
refletfts equal honor on his own hu
manity and the difciplir.e of the
troops he commanded.
In addition to the above account,
we are informed that there were
near 300 men in the Fort at the time
of the aflault ; that seven of the as
sailants were killed ; and a few
wonnded ; among the latter are
Gen. Cuyler ( flightly) and Lieute
nant Geyer of the 67th, who joined
the expedition at Barbadoes as a vo
lunteer.

o'clock, his royal highness the Archduke
Charles made his entry into this city, ac
companied by the fie Id marshal Prince oâ¢.
Saxe Cobourg, and a numerous retinue ot ge

tisfaftion the people have (hewn at this
change of* things ; almolt all the inhabitants
were on his paifuge, and the air echoed with
redoubled (hours. The Archduke repaired to
the church of St. Gudule, where I e Deum
was sung by way of thanksgiving- From
thence the Prince patTed through the princi

ceived unequivocal marks of the joy of the
Brabanters. At last having repaired to the
Hotel of the Duke D'Ahrearby, the wine ot
honor was presented to his Royal Highness,
and at night there wai a grand illumination.
Yesterday a courier arrived here from Vien

Netherlands. The fame day, this voung
prince set out to take the commai.d oi the
advanced posts of the army. The Count de
Mettemick, who before the French in van on
was inverted with the poll of mimfter pleni

brought the statue of Prince Charles of Lor

there was engagement nedr Antwerp, be

Gen. Dumourier having given orders to the

STATE PAPER;
Declaration of the King of Prutlia, refpefting
his taking poflcflion of the city of Dantzig,
and the territory belonging to it.
THE fame reatons which induced his raa
jefty, the King of Prullia, to order part of -his
troops to march into some of the diftri&s of
Great Poland, lay him under the neccflity to
secure the city of Dantzig and the territory be
longing thereto. For besides that this city ne
ver has aÂ£ted for a number of years past, like
a good neighbor towards the kingdom of Pruf
fis, it is now become the rendezvous of a wick
ed and cruel band, who heap tranfgreflion up
on tranfgreflion, and who try by the afliftance
of their deff*icable abettors to spread themfeives
on al! fides. One of these villains, after having
attempted in vain to Ipread his poisonous prin
ciples, among a happ\ and faithful nation, has
found nevertheless a free and public asylum in
the city ot Dantzig ; and it was only by the
mod urgent reprefenta; ions that hecould be ob
tained from his prote&ors. Thi.Â« last instance,
together with the numerous abuses ot a ifiiU
construed liberty, and the great connexion
which fubfi(l> between the faction in France and
Poland, and a certain party, which by itibans
of the impudcnce ot their principle*, have gain
ed a certain fupeiiority above the moO ot the
well-meaning part ot the citizens, and finally
the great ease wherewith these conspirators pro
cure all kinds of neccflanes, but efpeoally
grains at Dantzig, by the help of their abettors
are taken colli 6lively, as objects which have
drawn the attention ot the King towards this
city, and have obliged him to keep them with
in the bounds of jutiice, and provide thereby
for the fafeiy and peace of the adjoining Pruf
f*m provinces. For which purpole his Majrf
tv, after a previous agreement with the other
power* ctotftotd 1 herein, ha* diredted hit

Friday last a deputation from the French
Benevolent Society eftablillied in this city
waited upon cirizen Genet with an add reft,
of which the following is a tranilation :
Citizen Minijler of the French Republic.
The French citizens and citizens of the
United States defceudants of French, refilling
in Philadelphia, hasten to prelent this mark of
their attachment to the nation you
of their zeal for the cause of liberty and equa
lity, and of their personal regard.
Many of us attracted by tbe innate love of
liberty, when France still smarted under the
rod ofdefpotifm, fought and found an asylum
in this happy country, then the cradle of in
fant equality. The cordial reception from
our new fellow-citizens, the close connec
tions and pleasing habits contracted among
them, have rendered America a native home.
But in becoming Americans, they have not
ceased to be Frenchmen ; for no individual
can be more intimately conne&ed with either,
than the two, nations are with each other.
The French citizen who has become affiliated
to the American nation, and the citizen of the
United States whom France has adopted have
thereby only strengthened the ties of connex
ion.
An union cemented by the blood of the ci
tizens of both nations, and founded on so so
lid a basis as similarity of sentiment and prin
ciple, is formed to resist the most violent ef
forts of those whose interest it might be to
difhirt) it : for liberty tends to unite men, as
does despotism to divide and destroy them.
The million with tohich you are charged,
imposes on you the most agreeable duties,
since it is committed to you to give and re
ceive the afTurance and testimony of so sincere
a f-iendlhip and so fraternal a union.
will co-operate a 1; far as in our power 10
maintain so precious a fraternity and pre
vent the enemies of liberty from giving it
disturbance.
Permit us on this occasion, as individuals
and Frenchmen, to pay to our brethren of
the United States the tribute of gratitude
which their conduct towards us so jiiftly
claims. We were strangers among them and
they treated us as brothers ; they have been
prodigal of the attentions and afliftance, which
our situation required, and endeavored to
make us forget, that we d d not owe our
birth to a common country.âThroughout
the whole extent of the American empiie our
countrymen have experienced the effects of
the f.tine benevolent spirit. Every where
the citizens have been anxious to cfcetilh and
the governments to protest tliem. It would
be the heighth of ingratitude in us not to avail
ourfelvesof fo'favorable ait opportunity of
publicly exptelEng the extent of t>ur grati
tude.
Accept, citizen, our ardent wiflics for the
Cuccefi of the glÃr'tou? caule of which FraJiqp
hat declared berfelf the support. We hope,
that bv her generous efforts 1 berty Will soon
be trindijj'iaiit tbrougijout ihe in spite
of the enormous combination of despots and
flaveswho wish to annihilate it.
We felicitate ourselves in finding in you a
citizen who has deserved well of his country,
and who teaches Us to hope that he will ac
quire a new claim to her gratitude.

P. 3. DUPONCEAU.

rived here from Bonne, in Barbary,
with a cargo of wheat, relates, that
the Algeritie cruisers having taken
8 Dutch flu'ps, carried them on the
Jth of Feb. into Algiers, but that
the Dey immediately ordered them
to be released, that they might pi o
ceed to their refpeftive places of
dellination, because the term of 30
days, fixed by his Excellency for the
commencement of hostilities, were
not then expired ; and that the Vi
kil Hadgi, of the Marine, a sworn
enemy to the Chriltians, had open
ly disapproved of this generous ac
tion, and had incited theTurksand
Moors to condemn it so much, that
the Reys Selemi, a renegado Jew,
said publickly that to release tliefe
prizes was very unjustâthat they
exposed their lives by going out to
cruiseâand that now, when they
had the good fortune to take some
prizes, his Excellency had set (hem
at liberty. The Dey, being inform
ed of thi9 behavionr, fell into a vi
olent paflion, and ordered the Vikil
Hadgi to cause the mutinous Reys
Selemi to be immediately beheaded.
The Vikil Hadgi instead of execut
ing the order, concealed the crimi
nal on board a corlair ; but his Ex
cellency was so much irritated that
he wilhed to fend the Vikil Hadgi
to the prison of D.afarcagi, to be
there strangled. The Dey, howe
ver, on the prefling intreaties of his
wife, and the wife of the Vikil Had
gi, filler to the former, gave hiin
his life, but condemned him to ex
ile ;âand the sentence was imme
diately executed, the criminal be
ing put on board a Spanish Ihip,
which was instantly obliged to set
fail. This disgrace of the declared
enemy of the Christians, has greatly
rejoiced the ConfuJs of commercial
nations at Algiers ; and what adds
to their pleasure is, that the vacant
post of the Vikil Hadgi. has been
given by the Dey to his nephew, a
young Turk, formerly from the Le
vant, and who is of a very amiable
character. The Port Captain has
also been disgraced, and his place
supplied by another.
BOSTON, April 8.
A correspondent, who is a native
of the United Netherlands, wishes
to remind the Americans, that his
country is the friend and ally of
the United States ; that (he ailifted
them in the war, with money, &c.
and that (he now wilhes to live in
perfect amity and good fellowfhip
with them ; and to inquire, with
what propriety they can wi(h that
her territory may be overrun, her
towns burnt, and her property de
li royed ?
In a Liverpool paper of March
25th, are accounts of four privateers
and lixteen merchantmen, taken by
the British and Spanish (hips of war,
and carried into various ports. The
fame paper contains accounts of
eighteen Engli(h merchantmen be
ing taken and carried into France.
These are all in one paper.
We have seen a letter just receiv
ed from Paris, which mentions that
the lady of that unfortunate friend
to America, the Marquis de la Fay
ette, may be soon expected to fail
for the United Statesâwhere (he
will receive a cordial welcome.
Capt. Davis, when he failed from
England, had fafe paflports from
the AmbalTador of the United States,
countersigned by the American Con
sul there, both in the English and
French languages.

The Committee, appointed to examine 44 The
Preceptor's Afliftant, or Student's Guide," being
1 systematical treaufe of Arithmetic, by John
Vinall, teacher of the Mathematics Sc Writ
ing, in Bolton, reported, that they have attended
that service, and are of opinion, that the work
is executed with judgment, and is as well calcu
lated for the use of schools, counting houses, arid
private families, as any of the fame compass
that has hitherto been offered to the public.
Voted, That the above report be accepted,
and that Mr. Vi n a l l be furnifhed with a copy
of it, whenever he fHal 1 desire it.

CHARLES BULFINCH, Sec'ry.
The following chara&er of the above work,
is given in the Review of the MaJJackvfetts Ma
gazine, for Jan. 1793 :
u This is a very ufeful work, and is no ill
proof of the judgment and industry of the author.
The rules are laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are fufÃcient for their il
lustration. One part of the work deftrves par
ticular commendation. We mean that which
the author stiles ** Mercantile Arithmeticlt
occupies a considerable portion of his book, but
not more than its importance will juftify. We
would recommend to the young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to this branch.
He will find its principles well explained And
Qiould he make himfelf master of them, he will
always have reason to acknowledge his obliga
tion to the judicious and laborious author. We
cannot but congratulate the rising generation on
account of the many ufeful productions which
have lately appeared ; and in which their im
provement has been principally confuked.â
Among those produÂ£l*ons we mud place this
treatise of Arithmetic. We should be wanting
in justice to the author, should we not acknow
ledge that his work is in reality that which its
title importsâThe Preceptor's Assistant,
or Student's Guide."
