Connttr-fievolution in Ftance.
WE art b*M>y 'Â» being able to

comnionicated to the public on Saturday, is

ceived. _ , _
The accounts of the different defeats ex
perienccc! hy the French army, which reached
Paris aUnolt daily, produced the niott general
cooftâ Â»i nation among all ranks of peopte. A
niong'the meih&ers of the Convention in par
ticular, tlx? alarm was very great. Dittirent
members denounced Gen. Dumourier as a
bale traitor, wbo, preferring gold to the ove
of his country, had received bribes from their
enemies : as an ambitious villain who, under
the malk of patiiotifni, had u'ed every arti
fice to attach the army to himfelf, to leduce
the soldiers of the Republic iiom the duty
they owed to their country ; and to deltroy
thole in battle, whom he could not corrupt by
Different letters from Gen. Dumourier, and
coiivtrfati ms which he bad held with the
Conimiffioners in Belgium, Â» which he pla n
|y toid them the prefentform of government
could not lie maintained, were produced in
support of ttorfe cha'ges, in which it was al
leged he offered the grafcft insult to the Coo
v-ntion, the Reprefentntives and defenders of
the fÂ»vereiÂ»ntv of the People, by taking upon
him the office of Lsgillatnr ; dictating to then!
the eondaft tbay (hould follow ; cenlurmg the
laws which they had palled, in the name of
t ,e sovereign people, particularly the Decree
of the I Jth December, attd subsequent laws
r.-fpe&ing the organization of government in
. those countries, which tad been freed from
the yoke of tyrants, and restored to tbeir
Rights as Men ; and stigmatizing the mem
be- S of the Convention who had been sent by
them, and acted by theirauthority in Belgium,
â  as thieves and robbersâ thereby imprefling
the people among whom they were, with sen
timents refpefting the views and motives of
the Convention very foreign to those by which
thev were actuated.
The disasters which had befallen the French
army, the cau'.es which operated to give the
enemy the advantage, and the dismission of
the Sans Culottes, whom they ftiled Patriots,
whom Dumourier could not corrupt, and had
therefore disbanded, were all urged as proofs
of his guilt.
Dumourier, in the mean time, had arrang
ed matters with fume of his officers, and car
ried his army liack into France, " ,^ iere be
soon received intimation from his friends of
the plots la d to ruin him. A decree ordering
biin to appear at the bar, was carried against
hiin in the Convention, and Beurnanville,
'with five of its members, accompanied by a
fecretai y, were ordered to bring huD apriion.
er to Paris.
' Of this he was informed before the Com
niiflioners reached his army, and took mea
sures accordingly.
It was the opinion of his friends, that, even
independently of the intelligence he had re
ceived, the Convention, as a body, had Ihewn
an imbecility and weakness, on alnioll every
' occasion, that proved them altogether unqua
lified to legislate for Fiance, which they had
brought to the brink of deftruftion âIt was
agreed that means (hould be followed, to im
press the army with proper fentSmenti re
fpefting the conduct of the Convention, in
numerous instances, ard particularly towards
their General, who had fiiared every danger |
with them, whose valour they had all witnelf
ed, and whose good conduit alone had pre
served them from entire deftrufHon, and en
abled them to make a good retreat from a
country which had received tbein as friends
and brothers, but which had become their
enemy by the unjust exaftioni levied by older
of the Convention, and the conftiaints pi}t up
on their ft eed<>m,afrer the honor of the French
Nation had been pledged that tltey should he
Jest at free liberty to chafe their own form
of government.
The army, by the readiness with which
they agreed to support their General, (hewed,
that before it was proposed, they were, al
most to a man, inclined to put an end to the
tyranny of the Convention. Want of indi
vidual confidence alone had prevented them
from proclaiming their sentiments to each o
tlier before.
We have not room to give a long detail of
the subsequent business. Suffice it for the pe
fent to slate, that the general voice was for
refforing, with a few modifications the Con
stitution decreed bv the firft: or Constituent
Assembly, viz. a limited Monarchy. It is
even believed, that fomeof the Commissioners
themlelves approved of the measure.
When the Coniniiifioners, en the fiift of

SOME over refining per Cons cenfnre the
government for borrowing money in fo
reign countries. They admit that there :s a
lar,te saving by getting it at a very low inter
estâ'but they diilike the fending money out
of the country to pay the principal and in
tereftâlf the rate of interest is high ir. this
country, it Ihould be noticed that we have
the capital borrowed abroad to be employed
at a better rate in trade or manufactures than
the interest it bears.
But the tell of the objection toJortign loans
will be, to suppose the loans made in this coun
try. R.eilrain the government by law to bor
rowing in America âwhat is the consequence ?
Firfl, you throw the government into the
bands of the money-holderr, and as the law
removes all rivals, they will have the pluck
ing of the treasury entirely to themselves.
Ha 4 such a scheme been proposed, we should
have heard an uncommon peal rung about
speculators, and jobs, and favni itifin. Em in
the next point, the mifchicf of confining go
vernment to domcftic loans would injure the
merchants, manufacturers and farmers. For
this violent drawing of the nionied capital to
the treasury to lend it to government, would
drain the channels which it filled before. In
stead us buying land, improving farms, dyking
and draimog marshes, making canals and
roads, engaging in manufactures and trading
enterprizes, the means of giving fuccefj to
these will be eogroffed by the government
loans. It is not denied that this country,com
pared with England and Holland, is deficient
in monied capitalâlf the government will
not give better terms than a man can make
by his own management of his capital, he will
refine to lendâand if the government ftiould
comply with the terms, it is plain that he
will give up other less profitabl# employment
of his money to lend it. Foreign loans are
therefore forced upon almost every govern
ment itherwife the people would fuffer a
loss in the rate of interestâgreater taxes to
pay the iiicreafed interestâand a disturbance
in the value of money, which ought to be the
standard to mealure all other articles b> âa
finking of the price'of land, and a furpenfion
of enterprize and employment, which would
on fair computation make a coiifiderable loan
negotiated in our own country, twice as bur
densome, and in fa ft twice as great a drain
on the wealth of the people as an Amsterdam
or Antwerp loan.âHowever it may be seen
proper to attack the wisdom and purity of
the conduct of government, the publifc will
not be at a loss to decide that its interests
have been faithfully provided for in the cafe
alluded to. B.

Jhr.w the pernicious conjtquences re fulling J ro ' n

celebrated description oj Kings gixen in Jcripture
by the Prophet SamuelâOn which, a writer in

TPhe pajfage relates entirely to tfie Jews
preferring a kingly government to theocracy;
that is, to their chilling rather to bp govern
ed by despotic; monarch*, than by men of
God's o\vn immediate appointment, and un
der the guidance of* his unerring wisdom.
This foolifh and ungrateful stupidity of the
Jewiih nation, well deserved the variety of
oppression with which the Lord threatened
them by his servant Samuel. But how do
these threats apply to other kingly govern
ments ? to the Bntilh, for instance, or to the
French government, as established by the con
s ftituent alTembly ? should the people of
; France insist upon a conftitntional King, as
. the only rr.eafuve calculated to put a period
to their calamities, would the denunciations j
of the Prophet be applicable to that nation,
unlets it firft be proved and granted, that the
National Convention are a&ing under the
immediate direction of heaven, and that the
spirit of Samuel animates the breast of a Marat,
a RobertJ'piere, and other leaders of that body ?

subdued ; but a number ot these
unfortunate people weic killed be
fore they could be brought to rea
son, and we have likewise luli. a
number of brave patriots.
" T lie evil is much greater at
Nantes : The city is belieged by
more than country people,
having emigrated noblemen and
refractory priests at their head.
They are eonftantly fighting. *1 he
Patriots of Nantes have made great
havoc amongll these unhappy peo
ple, but this does not deter them ;
we likewise have 101 l a great num
ber of good patriots- All the mails
are intercepted. In short, we are
at war with all nations, and civil
war rages in our own bosom, which
is worse than all the combined pow
ers ; besides we arelurrounded with
traitors : But Jet it be as it will, !
hope we shall conquer them all,and
and that Liberty will triumph.
" A nuni ber of municipalities and
dillritfts have been maflacredâand
many of the citizens' houses and
castles of the patriots have been
pillaged and burnt, particularly in
the department of Vendee in Poi

we will sustain it. lam at present

" Normontiers, Bourgneuf, Ma

zens of Nantes have retaken St. Na
zaire and Croiiie , in the lad named
place upwards of 200 emigrants
were killed at one discharge.
" The patriots were lurprifed
through the want of attention of

rather think, betrayed. They have

9HInterview was violent. Dumourier ex
pressed himfelf in terms of iriveflire a
gainst the Jacobins. " They will ruin
France," (aid he : " But I will save it,
though they (hould call me a CsefaV, a
Cromwell, a Monk." The commission
ers carried the conversation no further.
They departed, and returned next day,
determined to dissemble, in order the bet
ter to discover the extent of his views.
Encouraged by their overtures, D imou
rier no longer kept any bounds. He said
that the convention were a herd of ruffi
ans, whom he, all, equally, htld in abhor
ance. That all the volunteers were pol
tioons ; but all their efforts would be ih
vain. " A3 for the reft, added lie, "there
Hill remain* a party âthe Jacobins have
only to cover with their bodies the survi
vors of the royal family, and to dismiss
the convention. If the queen and her
children are threatened, I will march to

the interview of the commiffioflers. Tfiey
quitted Tournay on the fame evening on
their return to Paris.
It was decreed that acommiffion Iho'iild
be formed to examine the conduit of the
Belgic cornmlffioners.
April 2
A letter was read from the administra
tors of Maine and dating, that
there was every reason to hope that the
insurgents would soon be dispersed, artd
that those of them who had been taken
had been tried by martial law,"and irrinrtt
diately executed. To this letter was ad
ded a copy of the examination of one of
the < insurgents, named Cartiho, from
which it appeared that the insurgents as
sumed. the title of the Qhriftian Army,
and'that their signal for rallying was Vive
le Roi", la Reine, I' Arillocrat ! It was
ftattd also, that they had declared for a
kingâthat they at fit (I amounted only to
fifty, that they had afterwards encreafed
to 12,000, and that they had twenty-five
pieces of cannon. Referred to the com
mittee of general defence.
The. mayor and procureur of the com
mune of Saint Arnoud gave an afccount
of the difinal situation of that diftrifit for
want of provisions. Referred to the com
mittee of commerce.
Debates refpefting General l)i3mourier.
In ihe beting of March 30th, after the
convention had decreed that geneial Du*
mourier ftould be brought to thi bar.
Marat moved, That the minitter at war
should remain at Paris, where he would be
more ufeful than on the frontier* infpett
ing the army of the north.
Camus said, that tlie miniftfcr hafd yt?-
terday made twÂ» obje&ions to the com
mitteeâ ill, The neceflny of hit presence
at the war-office ; 2nd, The bail Rate of
hii health. The committee repf!rt?d, that
his health Would allow him to take a
journey of seven or eight days to save his
country from danger j and that Kis aflift
ant would attend to the bofinefr'of the
war-office.
In the fitting of Aptil id, a nVeAibe'r
announced, that several committees had
fat aH night to extraA the different plans
of confutation sent by the departments.
Marat said, it WftTj'ld timfe inough
to think of the ionfti'tutiori, when Du
mouricr and the other felf chosen states
men should be known and punished.
Ciroteau moved, t+nrt without regard
to the national fibrtftritkllon, and tlie
inviolability of members, every member
fufpedted of confprracy againit the public
fafety, should be pot undlrr aireft. This
Was adopted iinanirtioufly.
Cambaceres, after reading g&n'c'rkl Du
mourier's letters, ancl giving an account
of the tonverfation which had passed be
twfeen hrm and the commiffiono* at Tdtir
najr, concluded the report made by hi/n,
in the name of the committee of public
fafety, by observing, that there was a
grand conspiracy, of which Dilmourier
Was the principal agfcrit, and that several
persons attached to th"e bbtife of Philip
d'Orleans, commonly called Egalite, were
vehemently fufpe&ed of being concerned
in it. He announced as a measure 'of
fafety, that all those supposed to be cOn
ne&ed with Oileans, or to wifhfor roy
alty, ought "to be apprehended. Philip
Egalite himfelf and Sillery would have
been apprehended but from refpeft to the
national representation, of which they
Were members. Being brought before
the committee, they both anfweied, that
they would consider it as their iluty to
submit to whatever precautions the pub.
lie liberty might require, 'and invoked ffie
mod fcrupurdiis examination of their con
du'ft.
Several,members wished to speak on
the condudt of Dumourier, but it Was ob
served, th'at it Wouldbe better to wait till
hfs arrival. Danton, however, entered
into some explanations of his own con
duct, 'and exprefled his indignation'at' tile
treachery ofDumourier.
Lafource said, that Danton abandoned
Dumourier only because he few his perfi
dy unmasked. The principitate journies
of Danton ; his rffofal to appeir ir. the
Committee ; his efforts to raise the'people
in a body ; and the immense fuins which
he had spent without producing any'ac
count, proved clearly that he wis in con
cert wirh Dmmbufiir. He moved, that
Sillery and Egalite should be put under
arrest ; that a commifiion should be form
ed, to examine the conduct of the com
miffiorters in Belgium ; that the'miniite
add/effed by DnbuilTon, Patiryfae, and
Paoli, should be printed arid fen: to the
army ; and that an address should be pre
pared, to explain to the French petiple
the misfortunes of their country.
Boiteau denounced Fabre d'Eglarttine
is having proposed the rc-eftablifhment
royalty.
Demas moved, that these denunciati
ons, which at the present moment might
ruin the public liberty, fhanld be referred
to, the commifiion proposed by Lafource.
âDecreed.
Dantonâ" The patriots'are oppreflcd
by the aristocracy. It is meant to mur
der them, by making the people believe
that they have been tampering in Du
mouiier's plot. [He was interrupted by
a vehement agitation of the Convention,
and afterwards proceeded} You reproach
me, you who fit on the Mountain,
not exerting all the energy of charadter
which nature hath bellowed upon me,
You accuse me of weakness. Very well!
I confefs my crior, and I proclaim before
all France, rhat thofe,who through ftupi
pity or weakness meant to withdraw the
tyrant from the sword of the law, are the
fame men who indulge in the infolept
pra&ice of calumny.; I am reproached
with not repairing to the committee at
the moment of my' return from Belgium
Howcould I?âoverpowered with fatigue,

after palling several liighrs without reft,
was it not riatural to yield to this firft
call ? Scarce had I obtained a few hours
of ripofe A'hfcn I re'paited to the C6m
mittee, and I call to witness all who were
present, what were my firft wordsâ"
Dumourier must he watched. Ditmour
itr is a traitor. Diimourie'r has said, lhat
the Convention cortfifts of three hundred
fools, led by four hundred ruffians."
" But t)umourier wilhes for a king,
and Danton is fufpefted of having hem
his partner in this audacious, this crimi
nal idea. Danton, who, if 1 may fay so,
ltd the tyiant to the fcaffold. But let us
cease to impute to innocence a ciirne. of
which these only who had the wicked ness
to keep terms with Louis can alone be
eaTonably fufpefled.âThofe who endea
voured to exasperate Dumourier
the popular societiesâThose who wished
to punish the civifm of Paris, by arming
the departrtfiehtfe iigainft itâThose who
at clandestine suppers concerted plans of
cotifpiraty with Turn. I defy the triitor
to produce a single line of mine that can
compromise me with him. If he can,
let iny htad pay the forfeit." He con
cluded With fir6'po(ihg to levy fifty thou
fahd men sot the prote&ion of Paris { and
that the Commission above decreed {hould
take cognizance of atl the deputies since
the opening bf the Convention, and of all
publications against the unity of the Re
public, &c.
Obfelin, from the Committee of Sor
reilance, announced that a great number
ofdeferters was flocking to Paris. He
read a Declaration of the commandant of
the light cavalty of Calvados, denouncing
Dumourier and his Aid-de-Camp Baptille,
formerly his Valet-de Chambre. The
Convention passed a decree for apprehend
ing at the barriers of Paris all military
men who (hould not produce leave of ab
sence.
Decreed that Baptifle be put utitter at
r'ell.
SITTING OF THE JACOBINS.
Monday, March 25.
A vible'TTt debate "arose on the quefti'dn,
whether the society ought riot to fend
commilfioners chosen from its own mem- !
bers, to accompany those of the Conven
tion into the departments.
Drtlielrtc said that the fiharic'fs of the jj
society in a very deranged state.
Marat treated this as a frivolous excuse, '
and said that the society ought to fend '
into the departments trully persons, who \
might fcci'etly fdund the public Opinion. ',j
This, added he, would be the Only means
to save your emiflaries from th'e poignards â¢

800 millions of expences, and 150,000

the fruits'of all our conquests in the Ne

Marat.â" Dumourier pretends that :
the cause of all our misfortunes ought to
be ascribed to the diforganizers who exist
in his army ; but thei e are no other difor
ganizers except the chiefs whom he him
felf has chosen."
An administrator of the department of
DÂ£tlx Sevres, after mentioning the trou
bles by which the ten itoiies of the Repu
blic are desolated, cried out, â" Rife,
your enemies are in the midst of you
crufli them, or they will cru(h you ! The
people can only save themselves. Let

Hebert.â" The counter-revolution is

your tyrants ; they are in concert with
the generals and the executive power.â
Let the people then rife. The Conven

[Several voices from the galleries here
cried out, " No more quarter, let us rife
