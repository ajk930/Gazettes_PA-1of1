TO THE SIEUR. GENET,
Minijler oj France.
C LOATHED with a diplomatic charaAef,
and received, bv the firft functionary of
the United .States, as the accredited Minister
from a g;eat nation, you sustain, fir, an office
to which the policy of the American republic,
religiously obicrvanr ol the universal law of
rations, allures etni:ifent immunity. Regard,
ingyoii in this high character, a republican
pew claims to address yon.
To announce, in this address, the name by
which I am per Ton ally kuown, mi ht be ar
htijtoed as oftentationt' neither is it required
by she usages of the American press. But the
M.m of honor, fir,' disdains to communicate
t .j;4ugh t'le press what he would not avow at
the command of propriety. And, although
ideas of delicacy may now advise me to con
ceal my name even from the printer, I fpum
the idea of (hrinking from the charge should,
jultice'and honor forbid such concealment.
Yet, while my language does not offend a-
prmxriptoriTrtroertit*tiwt xbti*
J may fairly claim to be the sole iepofitory of
my own secret
Deriving no perfotial emolument from the
fifcal system of the United States, and holding
no office under their national government, I
am not the dependant of any of the ohiefs of
departments, and living in a land of liberty,
I difejaiu to be the stave of party. A plain
man, I speak in the charafler of one of the people.
Conscious that the sovereignty of the United
Stares resides in the people, and that the au
thority of their government is an emana
tion from their will, I purpose neither to
disregard the dignity *>f your representative
office, nor to violate the decorum that be
comes the char after which I now personate
before an enlightened public.
That you are not Jellitute of talent, is ob
vious from communications which the press
has fubmittcd to the- public eye. That you
have been unfortunate si ice your arrival in
America, is probable fTfoin the fame com
munications. And God forbid, fir, that any
part of the American people ihould, for this
cause, qfi?r you indignity !
7>Â«. ixaen inured unfortunate, ir, er
ring through ignorance, ancl not from inten
tion, you have prejudiced the cause which du
ty and disposition urged you to benefit. And
to prevent your being thus beguiled by error,'
is not inconfirtent with the principles of real
Jriendlhip.
That you fhduld err in your ideas of the
Ame ican public, is a misfortune, against
which aii extensive acquaintance with the
hillory of departed empires, or with the ac-
toal state of society in Europe, could not,
alone, complttely you. In the United
States, fir, the human character has adorned
a form uptrior to whatever authentic history
has recorded of Greece, or Rome J countries
in which ferocious manners characterized a
rigid ariftoci'acy, and profligate populace,
who struggled for domination, and alternate
ly outraged the law of moral order : And to
convince you tliat the speaker's opinion is
consonant to that of a philosopher whose ta
lents ought to command your refpeft, I refer
you to jeffeifon's " notes on Virginia."â
The feudal difpotifms of Europe, in which
hereditary usurpation has ethafculated rhq
energies of mind and yet reigns over syco
phants and slaves, are strangers to that force
of character which resides in the citizens of
America.âAnd the French ardour for liber
ty yet wants that temperance of mind which
characterizes thp republicans of the new world.
Feeling in the cause of liberty that Â»rdor
of spirit which diftinguilhes your nation, and
arriving among a people whose love of liberty
is the strongest sentiment of their foul, you
feein, fir, to have been ignorant, how much
the American pafiion for liberty is tonder the
discipline of an exalted reatfon. The Ame
rican palTion for liberty is not the Roman
pride of domination j a criminal pride, that
claims liberty for one nation, and denies it
to a conquered world. No ! The American
citizens are fnends to the cause of universal
liberty, which, in their estimation, is infepar
â ble ii om the equitable empire of law. And
the adherence to that liberal order which the
law of republicanism preftrihes is estimatedÂ»
by them, as being friendly to virtue, and re
quifite to the good of universal focietv.Â«â
Glorying in republican principles, persuaded
that all the tyrannical thrones of Europe niuft
Â«re long fall before the united forces of phi
losophy and liberty, they proudly claim for
themselves that national independence which
they acknowledge to be the right of all the na
tions ot the globe. And, while they exult in
the hope of the universal funeral of monar
chy, they recognize, within the circle of their
own empire, no sovereign but themselves.
The firft functionary of this sovereign, fir,
is that veteran patriot, Washington. To
him is uiianimoufly confided the helm of em
pire. Yet, if he is guilty of violating that
corftitutioa which cloathes him with the ex
ecutive power and prescribes the rule of his
duty, if he is faithlefs to that high trull to
which he has (Worn to be faithful.â<lo I in
jure you, thou firll citizen of America, by
luppofing in impossibility ?âlf I fay, even
Washington is thus guilty, he knows, and we
all know, that he is constitutionally responsi
ble. But, ai to this point, the people of the
United States want no foreign interference:
and our fair swords will never permit hftn,
or any other man, in this country, to be ar
bitrarily accused, arraigned, and ordered to
death, by a tyi ant who bears the name ol'Na
tional Convention. As the only sovereign,
ibe people know that the legitimate power of
their constituted authorities eflentially ema
nates from their will, which is announced in
the constitution. And fir, as they have pro.
vided for the constitutional punishment of
their highest officer if guilty of high crimes 8c
misdemeanors, they, on the other hand, as
men of honor feel tbemfelves pledged to sup
port him in the performance of his constitu
tional funftionj: and, as men who are not
dastards, they must and wiil thus fupporthim.
As to thq*Â£ ( Â»<ftitutio<iality of the measures
which the President has adopted, relative to
rrirroc, ant} hrr ciwniW*, 1 rcct.Â»
charge him with having mifcondufted. No
man, I am confident, who ha; corre&ly deve
lopedthe principlesof universal law, if be will
honeltly speak his opinion, will fay, that the
President's proclamation Was uaconftitution
al. The book of universal nature, being a
chef i'auvrt, is the only work which the Ame
rican people recognize as being of indrfputa
ble authority in all political queftfons. And
I prei'ame, that, after fully consulting this
authority, you would not be able to prove
from it that the President has mifcoudu&cd
as toTrance Except that lam not an ora
tor as you ai*e, and if a man who never had
an ofllce at Versailles, and who in the simpli
city of nature speaks right on, were adequate
to maintain an argument againlt the Minister
Plenipotentiary of France, I Ihould hope, were
it proper and neeeflary, to be able Specifi
cally to maintain the present sentiments a
gainst even yonrfelf.
The mealufes of the President being con
ilitutional, his enlightened fellow citizens, as
men of principle, would support him, had lie
never been the Chief of their patriot army.
Independently of tteir sttachitietit to the urft
of Generals, their perfbnal and public honor
is, by the very principles of the fecial contract
pledged to support their own officer in exe
cuting the lervice which their country has
assigned him. And they know that the prin
ciples of political arrangement and national
prosperity ptefcribe the establishment of pub
lic authorities, as being requisite to the be
neficial administration of their conimoii af
fairs, as eflential t6 their capacity of acting
in concert, and as indispensably necessary to
the maintenance of their own independent
sovereignty.
Sir, the of the United States
afis by conftitnted reprelentatives, and hot
otherwifc. This sovereign, as such, limply
wills : And it is done.
On mature deliberation, the American so
vereign, in adopting a general constitution
for the empire, has determined not to have
" any direst correspondence" with foreign
powers. And the President, as the organ of
the whole American nation, immediately re
presents the whole people for the purposes of
national intercourse. Their sovereign will,
as manifefted in the national constitution,
haspronouriced, that it is neither wife ror
beneficial to admit any application from fo
reign States except through the organ of the
executive. Their .general plan of policy be
ing delineated in the constitutional chart, its
fpecific execution is committed to the ref
peftive authorities, who are the constituted
organs of the sovereign in the business of ad
niiniftration. The American sovereign, fir,
has such a sense of his own character that he
disdains the idea of being peribnally called up
on to ast in queftioos that merely concern
the actual administration of affairs.
The principles of liberty forbid the sovereign,
who wills, to also act. Philolophy forbids ftâ
National dignity, and justice, forbid itâThe ne
cefTary principles of republicanism forbid itâ
And, notwithstanding the example of the French
National Convention, it is not in the power of
the collected talents of all Europe, to make the
enlightened sovereign of America guilty of thus
outraging the principles of liberty, philosophy,
dignity, justice, repubiicaniTra. We refufe
to negociaie except through the ageocy of our
executive ; not becauie we fear the President as
our master, for he has no luch chara&er, and
we have no such few ; nor because we are such
idiots or cowards as to think the power of go
vernment fupcrior to our owo, for we know
that the power of government is derived from
our delegation ; but we refufe any other mode
of national negociation, because we judge this
mode to be wisest, btft, justâand, especially
and above all, becanfe such is our sovereign will.
And (bould the maintenance of this will require
the sword of the people, you and all mankind
may be adored, that ii must not, will not, and
(hall not deep in the scabbard.
Such, fir, are fentiroenu which the American
people hold forth to nations. And, from iholc
533
fcntimenti, the. Trench ought not to desire or
txpÂ«Â£l Americk to depart, although her sove
reignty {houty be invaded by all the powcis of
Europe, followed by the reft of the world, like
hell wiih blatkrfttnfurre&ion, at their heels!
Judge then, fir, what mud be the fentimenta
of Americans, on examining the publi(hed let
ter which you have recently add relied to the
chosen representative of the whole American
nation ! A plain mart as I am, expefi not that I
should (peak on this fubjefl with that Cublime
and impafliooed eloquence which has been cul
tivated in France more than in any other mo.
dern nvti'on I Thereltjte, permit me to Ijpeak
and freely, as 1 feci, and because I feel I
without undertaking, however, to pronounce a
panegyric ou myfelt, a bufincfs at which Ame
ricans are not expert, I leave it to others, to
fftinute whether 1 evince any portion nf " the
energy and franknefa which ever characterize a
true republican."
Unfortunate indeed may you be deemed, if
you have been led, from any cause whatever, to
indulge the visionary idea of a separation be
tween the President, and the people of Ameri
ca, And yet, fir, you appear, from your awn
words, W fcfeve indulged vhw idea. For is.since
(.*â - f f of>t
hasokvin-ucd against the views of the people,
and aga>nft their principles of honest faith. as to
Frafnce, the President is at the head and front of
the offending. Would you, by pdblifhing the
late official communications relative to this fub
je&, be understood to charge him, fir, with be
ing unfriendly to the cause of liberty ?â-with
wishing to be the sultan ?âwith a defjgn, by his
conftruefcion of treaties, to aid the league of
powers against France ? Or would you be un
derstood to charge him with fearing tfie power
of Britain, or any other nation, and with, pufil
lanimoufly defer tin# the charatttfr of America ?
He has been proved* fir, not only in the calm
hbur of peace, buÂ» amirfft the storm of war.â
And no lncohfiderabrle part of his countrymen
have been proved by his tide. Yet, it you
think the young Americans, who have never
tried " Â£he flinty and steel couch of war," are
dastards'; and if ynu would know how the fact
is ; if too you think that such condutt on vour
part will promote the objefcU of your million ;
let their fathers be insulted ! you may then
know whether the sons are dastards.
Do you then mean to publickly charge the
Prefidi.-;# with Violating the obligations of our
nation* J To him, to you, to the
charge tsTJ.fUfuUy inter tiling.
HavC not otfr judicial officers, by their opi
nion, fan&ioneo his interpretation of cxifttng
treaties? And are not the judges the constitu
tional expofirors of all our laws of every de
scription ? And are not treaties part of the law
of the land ? After our judges have expounded
the law, do we recognize, as relative to our own
conduct, any ulterior tribunal of adjudication ?
And db you imagine, that any foreigner what
ever shall, within the circle of >ur empire, be
eventually permitted to aÂ£f, in any cafe what
ever, in opposition lo such interpretation ? Do
you deem it advifeable to appeal, on a national
question, from our conftuuted authorities, whose
decisions we acknowledge to be obligatory on
ourfelvei, to us who have constituted tbofe au
thorities ? The procedure, fir, would not ac
cord with the established order of things in thi|
country. But if, while sustaining the
of miniiter plenipotentiary, you choose to avail
yourfcif of that general liberty which every
person has of publicly dating whatever any
printer will publifti, there is no law in the Unit
ed States which can, in the firft instance, prevent
the calling upon the American people to
judge of the President. But
tiich a piocedurc, in a quellion be
tween our nation and a foreign power, being of
the nature of a u direÂ£l correspondence" with
the fovereign,is uot conceived by the people, 44 to
be within the line of propriety or duty." Our
sacred regard, however, to the liberty of the
press, renders the procedure practicable. And
if a foreign minister should, before the tribunal
of public opinion, thus impeach our higheit of
ficer of disloyalty to his fovereign,that fovercign
will indeed decide on the merits of the appeal,
and with a spirit worthy of an enlightened fo
vereiert. If the officer has been guilty of be
friending tyranny, guilty of violating his offici
al duty ana our plighted faith by facnficing the
honest mtcrefts of our friends to those of their
enemies, we mud and will be fatisfied. If our
national integrity be appealed to, and national
justice is publickly demanded against Walhing
tort, by our honest swords we declare, that, if
constitutionally proved guilty, he shall be pu
nished. Although he has grown grey in the fcr
vice of his country, yet we have the firmnefs to
steel our hearts for the momeot, and to dare be
just even against him. But by the fame swords,
which we hope will never have cause to blufti
for their owners, we further declare, that the fo
refg* jsisiarr, who thus fevcrely invokes our
jiiftiel, makes an experiment upon us whicn he
must never repeat ; For, on thia fubjeft, no fo
reign power (hall use us for sport. And if you
have ever once thought of adopting such a mea
sure, let me, if you are pausing on the banks of
the Rubicon, request you to consider its confe
qucnce. In cafe of its adoption, yourfelf or
Washington, must be condemned. Should you
demand of us to fit in solemn judgment on the
man who commands our united hearts, you must
in the event, seal either his, or your, political
damnation ! Should you publickly appeal Wafti
ington of national disloyalty, be sure you fur
oifti damning proofs againQ him I t>Â« sure, yÂ«u

injured frienri(hip, â¦â¦****â¦*
Sir, you have been received as mini iter pleni
potentiary from a nation whose friendfliip we
value, and purpose to defervc. Yet, as proud
as delicate on the fubje& of friendship, the Ame
rican mind can feel the implications contained
in your letter ro the Prefidcnt of the United
States. â¢ Then, fir, if you wou4d not alienate the
mind of America, fort.ear, on this rhemc* the
language of reproach ! Goad rot the spirit ot'
Americans, by accusing their common repre*
tentative and friend of cold indifference to the
cause of liberty â¦ nor charge him with want
fidelity to their public engagements! It is tht
pride of the American nation, fir, to observe its
treaties of commercial amity, and yet be just to
every nation under heaven : Its firmnefs too is
equal to its pride.
If you value the American cftimation of the
French, it is hoped, that you will never, in fu
ture, mention the disinterested friendship of
France to thiÂ« country in the vary fame sentence
in which joti complain that the American go

It is further mentioned, for your refl.flion,
that the American researches have not yet rfif
covered, in any of the regions of science, that
the obligations of gratitude are perieftlv com
pulsory like those of justice. Nor has moral
philosophy as yet taught them, that it is a proof
ot delicate generosity to speak of meafurcs un.

Notwithstanding the great diÂ»Â«rJitj of,po

disappoints the wiflies of her enemies, and

The husbandman finds an high price, and
increaling demand for tiie products ofhis foiL
The mechanic has coftftant employ, and full
compsnfation for his labour and 11cill. The
merchant visits every part of the globe, in
Cuccafsfu! pursuits of gain ; and while the na.

each other, his Ihips can alone supply them
with the bread that feeds, or the apparel that
covers them.
Free from restraint, aod welcomed to every
shore, the American seaman can ftfurely, and
ilmoft exclusively, carry the produce of the
world, and command a recompence.equal to
his wilhes. In Europe, the sailors are em
ployed in navigating their (hips of warâthe
artizans, instead of fabricating the conveni*
ences of )ife-*-the husbandmen, instead of
tilling the foil, and producing subsistence for
themselves, and others, are busied in mutual
deltruftion. Americans enjoy almofl: a mo
nopoly of feeding and carrying for the richest,
and most populous nations of the earth. This
enviable condition the people of the United
States know well how to estimate ! and, in
jnftice to themselves and posterity, cannot,
will not put at hazard. They have too lately
experienced the horror? of war, and too dear
ly paid for peace good government, to
risque their preftnt tranquility.
From the Columbian Gazetteer.
In the days of contest, between the charac
ters of Whig and Tory, it was often alked,
(and fometiraes very gravely) to which of them
we Ihould suppose the Apostle Paul adhered
and a positive answer to this would have de.
cided the opinion of mod who made that en
quiry.
The fame implicit confidence is given at
the present day, to the decisions of tlmfe nf
the firft (landing in the State, and a propor
tionable degree of it is always bestowed on
men of eminence in every station ; this, by
many is supposed to be a very rational mode
of Judging, in cases where one is not fufficient-
Jy acquainted with the merits of a cause to
judge of it himfelf.âBut there is a different
class of mankind who fufpeft the Judgment
of all who go in * higher walk of life, and
that from a strange idea, of which they seem
to be very fond, that goodness and greatness
are incompatible, and that no one can be wifir
who knows more than them r elres, or boncft

Â£Con'imed/ram our ft*per of Saturday U/t^]
r pHE logic employed T>y the writeV oil this
pccafton, will b* best underflot d by accom
modating to it the language of * proclamation,
founded on the prerogative and-pokey of fuf*
pemding the treaty with France.
Whereas a treaty was concluded on the
day of between the United' States and the
Ffench nation, through the kingly government,
whlclf then the organ will: And
whereat the said nation hath since exercised its
right (no wife abridged by the said treaty) of
changing the organ of it* will, by abnlifhing the
â  said kingly government, as inconflflent with
the rights and happinef- of the people., and efta
blifhinga republican in lieu thereof, as most fa
vorable to the public happihefs, and best suited
to the genius of a people become sensible of
their rights and alhamed of their chains: And
whereas,by the conftitncion of th United States,
the executive is authorised to receive ambafla
dor#, other public mwifters and consuls: And
whereas a public minister, dujy appointed and
commiflioned by the new Republic of France,
â¢ hath arrived and prefeotcd himfelf to the execu
tive, in order to lie received in his proper cha
ra<fter: Now be it known,'that by virtue of the
said right veftbd irt the executive to receive am
bafiadors, other public minillers and consuls, &
of the rights included therein, the executive hath
refufed to receive the said minister from the said
republic, and hath thereby caused the a&ivity
and operation of all treaties with the French na
tion, hitherto in ferce 'as fuprerne laius of {he
landy to be lufprnded until the -executive, by
taking off the said fufpeniion, ftiMi revive she
feme; oÂ£-which, all perfom concerned are to
take n tke, ta theif "irt r bi<'v/ j t i
The writer, as if beginning to feel that he
was grasping at more than he could hold, endea
vour?, all of a fudden,to squeeze his doctrine in
to a Tmaller and a less vulnerab'e shape.âÂ»
The reader shall fee the operation in his own
words.
u And where a treaty antecedently exists
between the United States and such nation (a
nation whose government has undergone a revo
lution) that right (the right of judging whe
ther the new rulers ought to be recognized or
not) involves the power of giving operation or
not to such treaty. For until the new govern
ment is acknowledged, the treaties between the
nations, ai fur at leojl as regards public rights %
are of tourfe suspended."
This qualification of the suspending power,
though relu&antly and inexplicitly made, was
prudent, for two reasons; firft, because it is
pretty evident that fri*ate rights, whether of
judiciary or executive cognizance, may be carri
ed into effu& without the agency of the foreign
government; and therefore would not be fufj
pended of course by a rejr&ion of that agency.
Secondly, because the judiciunj, being an inde
pendent department, and a6Hqg under an oath
to purfne the law of treaties as the supreme law
of the laad, might not readily follow the execu
tive example, and a right in one expositor of trea
ties, to consider them as not-in force, whilst it
would be the duty of another expositor to confkief
them as in force y would be a phenomenon not
so easy to be explained. Indeed as the do&rine
(lands qualified, it leaves the executive the right
of fnfpcnding the law of treaties in relation to
fights of one description, without exempting it
from the duty of enforcing it in relation to rights
oranother description.
t But the writer is embarked in so unfnundan
argument, that he tfoes not save the reft ps his
inference by this facrifice of. one half of it. It
is fiot trite, that all public rights .are of courie
suspended by a refufal to acknowledge the, go
vernment, or even by a fufpenfioji.of the govern
ment. And in the next pUce, the right in
question does not follow flf.m the neceflary sus
pension of public rights, in canfequence of a rer
suss.l to acknowledge the government.
Public rights are of two forts; those whiclj
require the .igency of governments,thofe wlucfc
may be carried into efjeel without that ag?nc 1 /,
. As public rights are the rights of the nation.
not of the government, it is clear that wherever
they can be made good to the nation, without
the oflicp of government, they arc not suspend
ed by the want of an acknowledged govern
ment, or even by the want of an existing goÂ»
vernment; and that there are-important rights
of this description, will be illustrated by the
following cafe:
Suppose, that after the conchifion of the trea
ty of alliance between the United States and
France, a party of the enemy had surprised and
put to death every member ofcongrel's; that
the octafion had been used by the people of A
â¢ merica for changing the old confederacy into
such a government as now exi(lsâ and that in
the progrefsof this revolution, an interregnum
had happened. Suppose further, that during
this interval, the dates of South-Carolina and
â- Georgia, or any other parts of the United States,
hid been attacked,and been put into evident and
imminent danger of being irrecoverably loft,
without rhe interpoficion of the French arms; is
it not manifcfl, that aÂ« the Treaty is the Treaty
of the United States, not of their government,
the people of the United States could not forfeit
their right to the guarantee of their territory
by the accidental fufjieiifion of their govern
ment; and that any attempt, on the part df
France, to evade the obligations if the Treaty,
by pleading the suspension of government, or by
refufmg to acknowledge it, would justly have
been received with universal indignation, as an
ignominious perfidy ?
With refpeA to public rights that cannot take
rfTrc} in favour of a nation without the agency
of its government, it is admitted that they are
fiifpended of course whfie there is no govern
mem e*iAeftet, an.! a rffufal to re-
mtt <XiHmjÂ» giovernriJert.' Sut uo
in favour to Intend the ope
ujatiftn of lyrc&ies, can either
â ale. }Vhcre exiftenjre of the government
isfufpentledv it m a hsCestf neCciSiy would
be a cai'r happening withau? the a& of tke Â«*c-
C*tive, and eonfequcrttly could prove nothing
for or"againfl. the right.
In the o'ther cafe, to wit, of "a refufal by the
. executive t* recognise an cxijliug government,
- however cetcain it maybe,-tnat a Cuipenfion of
some of the public rights might epfue, yet,it is
equally certain, that the tefuW would be with
out right or authority; and that or
authority could be implicd*or prptf Â£he
unauthorised a<st. If a right to da lfrÂ»ateyer
might bear an analogy to the necessary conle- i
quence of what was done without right, could
be inferred from the analogy, there, would be
no other iimit to power than the limit tQ its in
genuity.
Tt is no answer to fay that it may be doubtful
whether a government do<? or does noyt exilt;
or doubtful which may be the existing and a<s
- Government. The cafe stated by the wri
ter iÂ», that there are existing rulers; that there
i an acting Government ;..but that they are new
rulers; and that it is a new Government. The
full reply, however, is to repeat what has been
already oljferved ; that flueftiows of thi& fort are
mere questions of f.i&j us such only, they
belong to the executive ; that they would equal
ly btiong the executive*. if it was tieddown to
the rtception of public ministers, without any
diferetion to receive or reje& them; that where
the fail appears to be, that no government ex
lfts, the confeqnenrial suspension is independent
of the executive; that where the fa<st appears to
be, that the Government doesexift, the execu
tive nitdl be governed by die fa&, a*d can have
no right or difcrecion, on account of the date
or form of oho Guven*Â£?te;?fc, â¢"> p-Tuft so ac-
either by reje<shng ltfcpfific mi
nister,. or by any other step taken <*n that ac
count. If it does icfufe on that account* the
refufal is a wrongful a<ft, and can neither prove
nor illustrate a rightful power.
I have spent more time on this part of the
difcufiion than may apsear to some, to have
been requisite. But it was considered as a pro
per opportunity for presenting some important
ideas, conne&ed with the general jArtajeA, and
it may be of life in (hewing how very fuperfi
cially, as well as erroneously, the writer has
treated it.
In other refpeilsfo particular aninvefligati
on was iefs necessary. "For allowing it to be, as
contended, that a fufperifion of treaties might
happen from a consequential operation of a right
to receive public minifrcts, which its ail express
right veftcd by the constitution < it could be no
proof, that the fame or aftmilar effe<sfc cOuld be
produced by the dirc& operation of a conjiruc
five power.
Hence the embarraflfments and grbf? contra
dictions of the writer in defining, and applying
his ultimate inference from the operation of the
executive power with nrini
tlers. \
At firft if exhibits an " important â¢ instance
of the right of the executive to decide the obli
gation of the nation with regard to foreign naf
tions," v>
R.ifit)g from that, it confers on the
a right " to put the United States in a condition
to become an associate in war."
And, at its full authorises the execu
tive " to lay the legislature under an obligation
of declaring war."
From this towering prerogative, it suddenly
brings down the executive to the. right of " con-
Jfjkrt:ti*iliy ujj\ cling the proper or improper ex
ercise of the power of the legislature te declare
war.
And then, by a caprice as une*pe&ed as it i$
sudden, it espouses the cause 01 the legislature ;
rescues it from the executive right " to lay it
under an obligation of declaring war"; and aftwrts
it to be "free to perform its own duties, accord
ing to its own sense of them," without any other
eontrdul tjian what it is liable to,in every other
legifhtive ail.
The point at which it reft,is,
that Â«' tlit executive in the exercise of its conjlh
tutional fo-wc i, may eftabliih an antecedent (late
of things, which ocght to -weigh in thelegjflative
dttijions ; a prerogative which will import a
great deal, or nothing, according to the handle
by which you take it; and which, at the fame
time, you can take by no handle that does not
clalh with some inference preceding.
If " by weighing in the decisions"
be meant having an influence on the expediency of
this or that decision in the opinion of the legisla
ture ; this is no more than what every antece
dent (late of things ought to have, from whate
ver cause proceeding; whether from theufeor
abuf of conflitutional powers, or from the ex
ercise of conflitutional or aflumed powers. In
this sense the power to eftabliih an antecedent
(late of things is not constituted. But then it is
of no use to the writer, and isilfoin dire# con
tradiction to the inference, that the executive
may " lay the legislature under an obligation to
decide in favor of war.
If the meaning be as is implied by the force
of the terms Â« conflitutional poyv;V" thjt the
antecedent (late of things the exe
cutive, pught to have a coifitutional Height with
the legislature : or, in plainer words, imposes a
conjlitutional obligation on the legislative decifwnl,
the writer will not only have to combat the ar
guments l.y which such a prerogative has been
disproved . but to reconcile it with his lad con
ceflion, that "the legislature is free to perfoim
Its duties according to its own lince of them."
He miift (hew that the legislature is, at the
fame time, conjiitututianally fr:e to purfxe its own
judgment and conjlitutionally bound hy the iuihment
of tlx executive. ' "

JUNE 20.
B4RRERE, in rhe name of the
committee of public fafety,
made a report refpe&ing the trou
bles in Oorfica. " The whole island,
fai<3 he, is in a (late of coijnter-re
volution, and your commillioneis
have been obliged to act on the de
fenfive in the maritime parts of the
republic, which yet remain faithful.
You recollecft the decree againlt
Paoli ; perhaps it was impolitic ;
and although you suspended the ex
ecution of it, Paoli found means to
interefl the inhabitants in his favor,
by making them believe you would
give them up to the Genoese, whom
the Corficans dread and abhor; or
that you would crown theci devant
Dtike of Orleans, who is equally de
tested by the Corficans, who Inve li

oftray by Paoli and the priefls. Your

more fully explain to you tlie trou

" All is loftâthe counter-revÂ«vlo
tion is compleated. Paoli is named
generaliflimo, that is to fay, sove
reign of the island. The clergy
have been reinstated ; the emigrants
have re entered. Paoli, under the
malk of religion, has abased himfelf
to be eletfted President of the con
fulta (an extraordinary convocation
of all the deputies of Corsica) : the
inhabitants have been led astray,
relpecting the situation of France,
and the intentions of the conven
tion. The iiiifurgents are armed to
the number of 1000, or 1200, and
maintain theinfelves at the expence
of the republic. They have leized
on the stores and treasure, and those
who (how attachment to the French
republic are shot The towns in
the interest of the republic, are de
clared rebels, and are kept in awe
by Itrong garrifoiis placed in them.
Paoli has published a writing against
the Convention, whom he calls the
agenrsof the Genoese. St. Floient,
Baftia, and Calvi, are still in the re
publican interest, and well garri
soned with republican troops.
" The confulta opened on the
26th May. Paoli was declared Pre
lident, Leonardo Vice-Pi efident, &
Pozi di Borgi Secretary.
" Paoli has published a pretended
letter from Marseilles, which,among
other things, aliens, that all the
communes ps France have declared
themselves in infurretftion against
the capital.
(Signed) " Dalcher, Comm'r,"
Comho.n.â" Do you not fee, that
Paoli holds the fame language in
Corsica, as Gaudet, Vergniaux, Gen-
I'onne, and other confpiratorsdid in
the Convention ? It is time that
France fhonld know who are her
friends."
Lacroix â" Couthon have
said more. There exists a document
in the committee of public fafety,
in which a conyerfatiori is repre

which the latter prop ifed, that Ma

in Arabia. After parting from the

having in his toilsome journey, ex

took pad age for England, in a Bri

that a war was declared, he went on

WINCHESTER, Sept. 2.
ExtraCl of a letter from a correspon
dent of veracity, to the Editor here
of, dated German-Creek, Territory
South of the Ohio, Jiugujl 16.
" On the 4th inft. Col. Daugher
ty, of Jefferfon county, with 180
men, eroded the TenneflTee to the
Valley Indian Towns, killed nine
fellows and two squaws, took and
brought in seven prisoners, bnrnt
twenty towns and villages, and de
stroyed a vait quantity of vegeta
bles. The whiles had five men
wounded. The inhabitants on the
frontiers are in close forts, expect
ing a visit from the Indians when
the volunteersare tired of liarralfing
thein. Indeed the fpirlt of volun
teering feeins to be on the decline ;
only 40 men paraded on afignal for
an expedition, a few days ago ; tho'
I think a large company might be
railed, under the fanÂ»stion of go
vernment ; and it is absolutely ne
ceflary to give them a severe flog
ging, in order to bring them to a
sense of their duty, and teach them
to pay some refpeft to treaties."
A variety of concurring circum
ftanceg tend to confirm a belief, that
the volunteers now railing in this
State, will very shortly receive
marching orders, consequently, a
report now in circulation, rtiat
there will be no campaign against
the Indians this season, is without
foundation. Ken.Caz.
On the ift inft, the Indians stole
a number of horses belonging to the
Quarter-Master, at Fort-Hamilton;
they were pursued by a party of
dragoons and rifle men, to the dis
tance of about 40 miles, where the
Indians appeared in such force, that
the pursuers thought prudent to
decline coming to action. The In
dians being in such force near the
out-pofts, is an argument that the
treaty has failed, and of course the
army will very shortly receive
marching orders.

are fully rpprefentcd in this meeting.
2(ily. That we feel ourselves happy under the
cxifting government of the United' States, and as
far as our observation extends, an entire fatisfa*-

among all clafles of citizens in the State of New-

4thly, That the proclamation of the Presi

States a conduct friendly and impartial towards
the present belligerent powers of Europe, was a
meafurc well-timed and prudent, jufl and con
flitmional ; wifely calculated to promote the
welfare and preserve the peace of this country.,
sth. That an exaÂ£t and uniform obfervince of
existing treaties, and of the terms of neutrality*
enjoined in said proclamation, is both our druty
and intcreft ; arid.that we will use all proper
means to difcouragcand bring to justice, every

if the answer given him was not famtattory,* he

7th. Minilfcer to threaten, or attempt
an appeal, as it ajSpArs has been done, trmt* tty
conttuuent authority of this eoudtty to t"he peo

United States, no citizen under the pretended
right of expatriating himfelf at pleasure, le
gally enter on board any yc/Tel of war w\th afi
intention to commit hoftilines against any power
in amity wuh us; because, as no ;aw cxilts ac
knowledging right and prescribing the
of expatriation, the offended power has no
means ot discriminating the expatriarrd from
the real citizen, and the whole comrÃunuy is
liable to be involved for the crime of one ; the
laws of nature and nations, therefore, and the
principlesot fociety,annul such pretended rights,
and criminate such a&ions in the existing cir
cumstances of the United States,
10th. That we sincerely pray for the fuccefsi
of the cause oif liberty in France, and in all n?-
tions, freed from the evils of licentiousness; but,
as it is not in our power to render- her effe&ual
aid by embarking with her in the present war,
and as we are not required thereto by any treaty,
the ftri&eft neutrality is our wisest and mott ho
norable conduct.
