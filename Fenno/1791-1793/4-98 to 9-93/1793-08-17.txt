A ceXitry.to pay pai'ticiilai attention ta that
p.irt of the, feft. ti(v ju^oal
p.')Wer " ?Â« cottrnperjio bcfwttn a and, ci~
tizenf of Anothtr jlatc." It is contended, that
tliÃ ooght to he construed to reach none of
theft controverlifs excepting those. in w'nicU
a nvty bs j/lai/ititf, The ordinary ri|ieÂ»,
fir co'iftrnAion. will easily decide whether
those W3i'd: to be in li
mited feofe.
This extension of power is remedial, brcaufe
it is to fettle controversies. It is therefore
to be confli'ued liberally. It is politic, wife
and goad that, not only the controverts io
whch a state is plaintiff, but aifo those in w.hU'h
a ft'ate is defendant, should be fettledâBoth ca
ses therefore are within the reafoo of the re
medy ; and ought to be so adjudged, unless
the obvious, plain and literal fenle of the
words forbid it-
If we attend tfl the words, we find them to
>e free flow &nl>iÂ£uit)Y.apd
without room for fucli implied exceptionsâ
4 The judicial power oj lh< United States JhaU tx
end to controierfies betoor.en a- Jlate and citizens Â«J
mother Jlate." '
Jf the constitution really meant to extend
these powers only to those controverts in
which a state might be plaintijfto the exclu
lion of those in which citizen* had demands
against a state, it is inconceivable that it
flipivd have attempted to convey that mean
ing in words, not only so incompetent, hut
alio so repugnant to itâlf it meant to ex
clude a certain class of these controversies,
why were they not expressly exceptedâon
the contrary not even an intimation of such
intention appears in any part of tlie coulli
tution.
it.cannot be pretended that where citizens
urge and insist upon demands again ft a state,
which the state refufes to admit and comply
with, that there is no controvcrjy between
them. If it is a controvcfy between them,
then it c early falls not only within the fpirir,
but the very word*of the Conftiution. What
is.it to the cau'e of juftiqe, smd how can-it
iiffett the definition of the word controvcrjy,
whetheT the demands which catiie thedifpute,
are made by a state again ft citizens cf another
state, or by the latter againfr the fo*meri
When power is thus extended tp a Contrcvcfjs,
it necelfar'tly, as to all judicial pwrpofes, isal
fo extended to tho.e, between wjipjn it fub
fiils.
The exception contended for, would cou
tradift and do violence to the great and lead
ing principles of a free and equal national go
vernment, ontf of the great objects of which
is, to ensure jjftice toallâTo the few againfti
the many, as well as to the many against the
lew. It would be ft range, indeed, that the
joint and equal sovereigns of this country,
Ifrnuld, in the very Conftitqtion by which they
proteifed to ejlablijh jujlue, to far deviate from
the plain path of equality and impartiality, as
to give to the collective citizens of one state,
& rig it of filing individual citizens of another
state, and yet deny to thpfe citizens a right of
suing them. â¦
We find the Tame general and comprehen
sive manner of expreifing the fame ideas, in a
subsequent clause ; in which the Constitution
ordains, that * 4 in all cases aflfe&mg ambassa
dors, other public and consuls, and
tftofi in which aJlate pi>ll hi a party, the Avpreme
cdurt ihall ha\e original jurHfti&iau,"âQid
it mean here party.plaintiff-âif that inly was
meant, it would hare been easy to have found
words to express itâWords are to be under
stood in their ordinary and common accepta
tion, and the word party being in common
usage, applicable both to plaintiff and dejcndant y
we cannot limit it to one of them in the pre
sent cafe.
AVe find the Legislature of the United
States etprefling tfeemfelves in the. like gene
ral and comprehendve mannerâthey speak in
the fcltion of the judicial ast, of cohrro
vqrfiej where a State is a party, and aÂ» they
do not impliedly or exprefsty apply that term
to either of the Jitigmns, ii) particular, we
ire to underftar.d them as fpenking of both.
In tlÂ»e fame fcftion they the cases
where Ainbaifadors are Ploivtijfs, from thole
i(i which Ambaifadors are ucjinauus, and
make dfferent provisions reloading tjiofe
caes; and it is not unnatural to luppofe.
that they would in lilce manner have diftin
jyaiflied between rales w!iere a ft te was
plain t If, and where a fta'e was defendant, if
they had intended to make any difference be
tween them ' or if tiey had apprehended
that tlie Co.'iit.tutiou had ruaoe any difference
betwcci. them.
I perceive, and therefore candor n rgps me
to mention, a circuinftance which fee ins to

be fair repfoqingâBut the fame pnnciph * of
candor which tr ge me to meption th-s objec
tion, also me to lugmrft an important
diiTerende betu een tl.ie two cafe?âit is thisââ 
In ail cafe* of ftions ag&mft flare's or indivi
dual citizens, the National Courts are Tup
potted in all their and coÂ»,ftttiutiowal
proceedings and judsmputs v by the auu of'the, ;
executiye power of the United
I in cases of,actions against the United Stares,
there is no power wh.ch the courts can call
to their aid. From this diftin&ion important
conelufiufts are deducible, and tbs-y place
thecafe-of a State, and the case-as the United
States, in v?ry diifcreiat points of view.
I wifli the fiate of society was so far iinpro-,
ved, and thi it-cnce of government advanced
! toTucli a degree of perfection, a\ that the
whole nation could in the peaceable conrfe of
law, be compellable to do justice, ?,nd be.iucd
by individual citizensâ Whether that is, or is
not, now the cafe, ought not to be thus cwf* ,
tcrally and incidental}" decidedâl leave it a
question.
As this opinion, though deliberately foinjed,
; has been hastily reduced to writing between
the intervals of the daily adjournments, and
while my mind was occupied and wÂ«*aritd by
the bulyiefs of the day, 1 lea*, it is Itfs con
cil'e and connefied than it might other wife
have been. I have made no to
cases, bfecaiife 1 know of none that are not
diftttiguilh'able from this cafe Jrtqrdoesit ap
pear to me neceflary to shew that the lentir
njents of the belt writers on government and
the rights ojf men, harmonize with the prin*
ciples which'di reft my judgment on the pre
feht question. The ads of the former Con
grefles, and the ads of'many of the State
Conventions, are replete with similar ideas;
and to the honor of ilie United States, it may
be cb/erved, tfyvt in no other country are
this kind better, if so under
ftojd. The attention and attachment of the
Cohftitutioii to the equal rights of the 'people
aredifeernable in almost every fen tehee of
it ; and it is to be regretted that the proVi
sion in it which we have been cotliJering, has
not in every inflance received the approba
tion a,id acquie-fcence which it merits.â
Georgia has in ftfong language advocated the
cause of republican equality ; and there is
reason to hope that the people of that state
will yet perceive that it would not have been
confident with that equality, to have ex
empted thÂ«f body of her citizens from that
fuabilitv which they are at this moment ex
ercising a gain 11 citizens of another state.
For my own part, I am convinced that the
sense in which I understand and have explain
ed the words controvbrfies between a state
and citizens of another state," is the true
sense. The extension of the judiciary pow
er of the United States to fiich cor.troverges,
appears tome to bc wife, because it is
and. becau e it is ujfcfu/.
It is horttft, becau (e it provides for doing
justice without refpeefc of perfonx, and by se
curing individual citizens as well as Sfates, in
their refpeftive rights, performs the proqiifp
which every free government makes to eve
ry free citizen, of equal justice and pro
tection.
It is ufeful âbecause it is honestâbecause it
leaves not even the most obscure ard friend-
Jess citizen without the means of obtaining
justice from a neighboring stateâbecause it
obviates occ: si >ns of quarrels between States
on account ot the claims of their refpedlive
citizensâbecanfe it recognizes and strongly
rests on this great moral truth, that justice is
the lame whether ciue from one man to a mil
liqn, or from a million to one manâbecause
it teaches and greatly appreciates the value
of our free republican national government,
which placfes all our citizens on an equal
footing, and enables each and every of them
to obtain justice without any danger of being
overborne by the weight and number of their
opponentsâand because it brings into action,
and enforces this great and gjorious principle,
that the people are the sovereigns of this
country, and consequently that fellow-citi
zens and joint fovei e gns cannot be degraded
by appearing with each other in their own
Courts to have their controversies deffcritil
ned. The people have reafoa to prize and re
joice in such valuable privileges ; and they
ought not to forger, that nothing but the fee
course of constitutional law and government
can enfuve the continuance and ei j >yment
of th.ejn

constitutions, are the mort happy, free, en
lightened, and pfofperous people on the fare
of the cajth.
That such being thp : r situation, it is their
duty and iptereft to abftajn from wars, hoth

vate the blefljngs of peace with all the worldâ
and especially, by the most cit curafpetf, wife

7. That Americans being a considerate and

Philadelphia, Augufl 4th, 1.793'
Sir,
T aoffcaring that repealed contravene
I tions of oui neutrality have taken
place in the ports of the United Stales,
without having been discovered in time
for prevention or remedy, I have it in
command(rcju ihfi J'refident, to address
to the collcftor6 of the refpeÂ£tive difttipls
a particulai inllruftion on thefubjeft.
It is expected, that the officers of the
cuftomsin each diftritt,will in thecourfe of
their official functions have a vigilant eye
Upon whatever may be passing within the
ports,haibours^rceks,inlets and waters of
fuch-diftriA, of a nature tp contravene
thet'wsof neutrality, and upon discove
ry of any thing of the kind will give im.
mediate notice W the governor of the

iiftrid, comprehending the dittiift o
he cuftflms within which any such con
ravqntion (nay happen. *
l*o afiift the judgment of the officeis
in thi* head, I transmit herewith a
fchedulf.of rules, concerning lundty par
ticulars, which Toavr been adopted by the
President. Â»s dedyttious from the laws of
neutrality, eftabliftled and received among
nation*- Whatever (hall be contrary to
these rules will, of course, be to be noti
fied,.. as abovementiontd.
There are fume other points, which,
purfoant to oilr treaties and the determi
nations of the executive, I ought to no
tice to yoB.
If- any vessel of either of the powers at
war toithFrance (hould bring or fendwith
in your diltrid a prize made of the fub
jeÂ£b, people of property of France, it is
immediately to be notified to the Govern
or of the (late, in order that meafuics
may be taken, pursuant to the 17th arti
cle of our treaty with France, to dblige
such vcfl'el and her prize, or such prize
when sent in without the capturing ves
sel, to depart. |
No privateer of any of the powers at
war with France, coming within a diilritt
of the United States, can, by the 23d
article of our treaty with France, enjoy
any Other privilege than that ofpurchafing
I"tub viduals as Jhallbe Aeceffary for her go
ing to tie next port of the prince otflat'efrom
â¢which fht bat her commtjfion. If lhe should
do any thing bcfide this, it is immedi
ately to he reported to the governor and
the attorney of the diilrift. You willob
ferve by the rules transmitted, that the
term privateer is underltood not to extend
to veifJs aimed for merchandize and war,
commonly called with us letters of marque,
nor, of course, to vefiicls of war iÂ» the im.
mediate Service of the government of ei
thei ot thÂ« powers at war.
No armed, veifelwhich has bern or (hall
be originally fitted out 111 any port of the
United States by either of the .parties at
war is henceforth to have afyltim in any
diftri& of the United States. If any
such armed vtffcl lhallappear within your
dilliift, (he is immediately to be notified
to the governor and attorney of the dif
tfiHj which isalfo to be done, in refpeft
to any prize, that such armed vessel (hall
bring fend in. At foot is a lift of such
Armed vcffcls of the above description as
have hitherto come to the knowledge of
the executive.
The pu<chafing within, and export
ing from, ihe United Stales, ly ivay of
merchandize, articles commonly called
contiaband (being generally, wailike in
ftruraeuts and military stores) is free to
all the parties at war, and is not to, be in
terfered with. If our own citizens an*
dertake to carry them to any of those
partieÂ«, they will be abandoned to the
penalties which the laws of warauthorife.
You will be particularly careful to ob
serve, and to notifyas dire&ed in other
instances, the cafe of any citizen of the
United States, who shall be found in the
service of' either of the parties at war.
In cafe any vefiel (hall be found in the
ast of contravening any of the rules or
principles which are the ground of this
inftruftion, (he is to be refufed a clear
ance until (he (hall have complied with

Capt. Crabtree. who lately arriv
ed at Frenchman's bay, and now in
tKis- town, givei the following ex
traordinary account of a fea-ferpenc,
the authenticity of which may be
dependended on :â
" On the 20th of June last, being
on ipy pallage from the Weft Indies,
in the morning, having jnft made
Mount-Defart island, dillant nearly
ten leagues, 1 suddenly got fight of
a Serpent of an enormous fize,fwim
mjng on t'he furface of the ocean,
elevated about fix or eight
feet put of ,water, rather prone for
ward. That, part of the body.which
was cut of water, 1 judged to be a
bout the size of a bar tel in circum
ference, but the head larger, having
some refenrhlance of a borfe's. Ac
cording to the molt accurate com
putation which 1 made ill my mind,
of his length, I think it could not
be less than from S5 to 60fse t, and
perhaps longer. That part of the
body which was not elevated, but
of which I had a diftindt view seve
ral times, was larger than the part
o'iit r of water. The body of a dark
browji. 1 was within two bundled
yards of it near an hour j during
whtch time, as it discovered 110 in
clillation toinioleft us, nij felf and
the whole crew obfecved it with the
minuted attention ; nor was its at
tentiou less fixed on us. '1 he eve
was perfectly black, (hai.p, ai.d
piercing. 1 Â»as so near as !â > <ih
ferve cleaily that there were no fins
or external appendages >0 t.lÂ»e bcjH v ;
l>ut that its motion was by the h
itig.nfihe bodv, like ti lvÂ«i f<Â»rp
Duiing the tii.ie it was a l.ii ii f e .
vera! flocks of birds flew neat,* !>:VÂ»
it eyed very narrowly. ] obtervta
in it thegreatclt agility and quick

There is no doubt but this is one
of the two which have been seen in
tliefe pans. 11 accounts ngrtc ic
fpe<?ting their size and appearance.
Two of them (.perhaps tiie Ifanie)
were once seen.on the (hore aj' the
Cranberry ifl.tnds, but immediately
took to the water on being dilcover
ed. . These are the fMI ever seen Â»
iu our seas, that *e have any ac
count of, though they have been
seen on the coait of Norway, tnoie
than 100 feet in length.
At a general meeting of ihe citf
zens of Portland, an' tUe 99; h day

their neutrality in the prelent Eu
ropean war, was taken into conli
deration, and thereupon".

United States, are blelfiugs of tUe
highest Â«>ider, and thai the p*efer
vatiorrof them it efien:ial to the

Voted, That the interference of
any of our fellow-citizens ia the
present European war, would be no
less criminal to the public Â£ od,
than the private motives of 'f'"H
robbery and rapine aie immoral,
unsocial and detestable.
Voted, That we highly approve
and will ftriiSly eblerve the late
proclamation of the President ofthe
United States, declaring that their
duty and interest require a friendly
and impartial conduct towards all
the belligerent powers.
That in addition to the regulati

eye on that of any deluded citizens
or persons, whn may so far abandon -
their duty and common good
(as defined in the constitution, trea
ties and laws of the Uniied States)
as to intermeddle in the war on any
pretence whateverâand will nfie
our best endeavors that their de
signs may be defeated, and their
offences puniflied according to their
demerit.
Voted, That these proceed!ngs
be printed ; that a copy of them be

they fell in with an American ves

Baltimore, having on board Ijo
French paflengers, tind that front
this vefl'el Davis took two bags of
money, said to contain between 6
and 7000 dollars, foppofing it to be
French property. As he was noc
provided with a Commiflion, bis

occurrence, which took place at the

in cocft quence of a game at cards,
arising be'ween foine Ariltocrats,
who v ere in prison, the ceutinel at
the door commanded them to be
q'tiet, ii being his orders to prevent
any dilt urban re among them ; but
instead of judiciously complying
wj h this reafbnable demand, one
of theni ftized the mulket and for
ced it from the ceutinel, and gave
him abusive language ; one more
moderate, however, immediately
returned the gun. The centinel
after heing relieved informed so me
fiilors of whathad taken place, and
Â» large number soon colle<sied, seiz
ed two field pieces, whieh they pla
ced oppofiie to the building where
the Municipaliiy were then fitting,
a party then proceeded to the pri
foH, which they forced, and cut of
the heads of seven planters and a
pbyfician, sparing only the one
who had returned the gun. During
this time the general* was beat, and
the folaiers were immediately pa
raded ; but on being ordered to
march no one obeyed, fearing to
attack the sailors who were in great
force, a number of armed veflels be
ing at that time in the harbor.â
Happily no further violence was
committed.

and what adds greatly to the vajue :
of the donation, is the manner in
which it was conveyed :â  â " W-e

in the people of ihe United States, to fee, think,

that their eflfÂ«jys in this Ime were much superior
to iheir imitator* of the present day. They dif

A FRAG MEN 1".
" TT is contentment, not
X l-icbes," (aid he " that
makes a pei sou happy. Poor and
content, said the Poet, is rich e
nough." Ah ! ftid I, the Poet might
fay 10, or at least a person who bore
the name of a Poet mightâbut that
he was really a Poet, 1 deny. Po
verty has always been an unwelcome
attendant on good Poets, and it
plainly appears from t he abÂ«ve quo
tation from your would be Poet,
that he never expei ienced poverty ;
if he lud. be must have known that
it is jmpoflible for a man to be con
tent ed," when he is cold and hungry,
or when he has a beloved wife anil
children in a llarving condition,and
nothing where wit h to fill their bel
lies.âAt that inftaut a rap, rap, rap
at the door. .Come in, said I.
Good morning, said my neighboui
S ,in a tone of voice Co very low
and dirge like, that I tho't nothing
less than his wife or eldest son was
dead. Good morning, said I.â
".Would you go over and help me
flcin my cow," said he, in the fame
key that he had bid me good morn
ing. â Your cow i.said 1, is your cow
dead! Yes, fir, said he, ffie got in
the mire latt night and is dead .â I
will go and help yon, laid 1, he
turned his back and went out.
Alas, poor Yorick ! said 1. not that
the death of this poor bead boreany
similitude to that ot Y orick, but that
sentence is so imprefTed on my mind,
that when I fee any petfon in dtf
tress I immediately exclaim, alas,
poor Yorick !â I will alter < l,e 'Â«"â¢
tence iu the present cafe- Alas!
paor beast !âlf I had not forfaken
my mnfe 1 would write thyepitaph
tllou art gone âand whither no mor
tal can tell ; but the poor babes,
who expeÂ«sted support from thy
teats, are still left to mourn thy un
timely fate. âIt is for these pÂ«or
babes I lament âTheir lather has
not another cow.âWhere \>ill he
get tnilk to feed them? Can i his
man feel contented ! âAh ! Poverty,
" thou art a birter draught, this 1
know by experience, lor 1 have tact
ed thy very dregs.â Ye lons of af
fluence, remember the poorâconsi
der that it is very probable that
your children will feel the pangs of
poverty, if yon should efcape-âcoti
fider this, and lend the poor the
comforts of life, that ihe Great
Giver of all good things, may lend
them to your children. A. Z.
NEW-Haven, Julj 31.
ON the 25tl inflant died at bis
house in this city, the honorable
Roger Sherman, E(q. Senator of
the United States âHe was taken
ill about the middle of May lad, and
from that time declined 1 ill his
death. His physician fuppoled his
d Harder to be seated in his liver.â
He was born at Newtown in MaU'a
chufetts, April 19, 172t. As he was
Hot favored with an education an
fwejable to his genius, his improve
â nents and the honors to which he
aitaine*d, were wholly from hisown
abilities. His father died when he
was but nineteen, and in the ,care
of his mother and of a large family
of brothers and fillers, he exhibited
unwfual filial piety and fraternal af
fection. He came to this then co
lony of Connecticut when he was of
the age of twenty-two, and at the
age of twenty-four was appointed
fui veyor of lands for the county in
whiffh he lived. From that lime he
was conllantly employed in public
btrfinets, and ftiftained the various
offices of a Jtiftice of the Pcace, a
Keprefewative in the General As
sembly, a Juflicc of the Court of
Common Pleas, an Afiillatit, si Judge
of the Superior Court of the State,
Mayor of the City, a Representative
of the State in Congress, and a Se
nator of the United States. He was
a member of the firfl Congress in
1774, was â¢present and signed the
glorious act of Independence in
1776, and invariably continued a
member of Congress from its firfl
exigence till his death, whenever
the law requiring a rotation in the
repvefentation admitted it.
It is worthy of reniaik, thai tho
lie futlained b> many otfic'ts in ilie
civil government both ol the State
ami of the I'nited States, to all
which he was promoted by the free
fuffrages i>{ his fellow citizeiu>, and
iu moil oi Â« hich he cauld not, with
out a new election, continue longer
than a year, and in the reft not lon
ger than two, three or four years ;
and although for all those offices
there were, as there always are in
popvlar governments, many compe
titors at every ele<stion, yet Mr.
Sherman was never removed from
any one of them, but by promotion
or by a6i us legislature rcquiiing a
rotation, or rendering the offices
incompatible with each oilier. Nor
with the re(lri<stion just mentioned,
did he ever lose his election to any
office to which he had once been
elected, excepting his eletftio" as a
representative of the town in the
General Aflembly ; which office we
all know is almeft constantly fhift-
ing. This Ihows, to how great a
degree, and how invariably lie pof
lefled the confidence of hi* fellow
citizens. They found by long ex
perience, that both his abilities and
his integrity merited their confi-
dence.
To have been constantly employ
ed in ihe public feiviee for forty
eight yearsâto have fuftaiued so
innny and so important public offices,
and 10 have fultained them all wirh
honorand reputation ; to hava main
tained an amiable character in every
private relation ; to have been from
early youth an ornament to f.hrifli
anity,, and to have died in a good
old age, in the full pofleffion of all
his honors, and of his powers both
of body and mind, is a rare attain
ment, and as to him at least, an hap
py junction of circumstances.
