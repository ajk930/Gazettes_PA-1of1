HAVING attempted, in a late paper, to
flie\v that a rigid adherence to the sys
tem of Neutrality between the European na
tions now at war, is equally the dictate of
juflice and of policy, to the individual citizens
of the United States, while the nation remains
neutral, the question recurs, what is the line
of conduct prescribed to the nation itfelf, at
this delicate jun&ure, by those, immutable
laws ofjuftice and equity, which are equally
obligatory to sovereigns and to fubjefts, to
republics and to kings. I fliall not make any
consideration of general policy a leparate fub
jeft of enquiry, because I hold it to be one of
the moll undeniable principles of government,
that ihe truest policy of a nation consists in
the performance of its duties. The rights of
nations are nothing mote than an extension
of the rights of individuals to the great socie
ties, into which the different portions of man
kind have been comb ned ; and they afe all
mediately or immediately derived from the
fundamental pofltion which the author of
chriftianitv has taught us as an article of reli
gion, and which the reviled declaration of
rights of the National Convention in France
have to contain the elleiice of liber
tv. " Liberty," fays the new Declaration of
Rights, " consists in the power of doing what- |
ever is not contrary to the rights of others."
" Whatsoever," fays the Saviour of mankind,
" von would that men fhoulddo to you, do ye
even so to them." Let us therefore be can- !
tious to do nothing contrary to the rights of
others, and we (hall continue to enjoy and to
deserve the blessings of freedom. Let us do
as we (hould chufe others might do to us, and
we <hall deserve the favors of Heaven.

FROM /HE iOLUMHUN CINTJNEL.
MR . RUSSE I. L ,
If these are the principles upon which our
national condut-t is to be grounded, it wilj
foLlow, that an impartial and unequivocal
neutrality between the contending parties is
prescribed to us*'as a dutj;, unless we are bound
by some exilting contract or stipulation, to
make a common cauie with one of them.
I have already said it : The natural state
of all nations, with respect tu one another, is
a state of peaceâ" damns pchmufqut viciffin,
It is what we have a right to expert from
them, and for the lame reafou it is our duty
to observe it tuutouis them. In addition Co
this natural obligation, we are bound by ex
press treaties with F>* ce, England, Holland
and Pruflia, to oblrrve the laws of peace with
the subjects of their different governments,
and we have no right to interfere in their
contentions. Whatever raay be the current
of our fetuiuients, or of our opinio:!-.âwhit-
397
V. : 'Miy-hr t''? lavjrt? â vy trpr
pafiiotis, of the unfiles i'nfpiieti by our a'f.'c
tion*, we are not coniHtuted judges of riie
refb'ip&ive merits of their cau.e. From a
feeling of gratitude towards a nation which
aftiftecT us in the days of our own calamity, we
inav be d'rfpofed to throw a veil'over their :
own errors and crimes, and wilh them that
success which their frantic enihufiafm lias
rendered so improbable. As the descendants
of Englillimen, we may be willing to lose the
y of all the miseries theyinfli&ed upon
us in our just struggle again ft: them, and even
the relics of their resentment, which iti 11 re
fufe the complete fulfilment of the treaty of
peace, and we may wifli them still to retain
their reputation for fuccefsful courage and
conduct in warâas men, we mult undoubt
edly lament the effufion of human Mood, and
the mass of misery and distress which is pi e
paring fort he great part of the civilized world;
but as the citizens of a nation at a vail dis
tance from the continent of Europeâof a
nation whose happiness confiits in a real in
dependence, di Icon netted from all European,
iuterefts and European politics, it is our duty
rrmain, the peaceable and fiieut, though
forrowful fpeeVators of the sanguinary fcenc.
With the reasons for neutrality lY.g<refted by
these considerations of natural dnty and of
positive ft ; pulation, a forcible argument con
curs, derived from out in t ere ft. In the ge
neral confli'ft of all the commercial European
Nations, the advantages which will be
thrown into our hands, and the a&ivitv and
vigour which will be given to every branch of
our commerce, are too obvious to need any
difcufllon. As the natural consequence of
War, the neceliities of ast the belligerent
powers' must increale "in proportion as their
mearts offupply will divninifli, and the profits,
which m\ift infallibly flow to us from their
wants, can have no other limitation than the
extent of our-capfacity to provide for them.
With ail these inducements to a decided
neutrality, let us look at the other fide of the
medaL ;md fee what would be the con ft que nee
of our making ourselves partizans in thfc con
test.-âFirst, we fnouJd be engaged in a Ojuar
rel, with the laws of nations against us. It
.sttoftldbe a violation of oar politics? duties;
n departure from the principle'; of national
justice, and an express breach of the positive
llipulations of peace and fnei dlhip with the
several belligefent powers, contained in the
treaties which I have already'mentioned. An
a<ft of partiality in favor of either party would
be an aÂ«sfc of perfidy to the other.
I have so full a confidence in the equity and
virtue of my countrymen, that I ihotald reil
the argument on this point alone, if 1 had not
perceived that a contrary system of policy, is
avowed by men of some influence among nr.,
and openly recommended in some of the pub
lic prints of the day. A system, which prf
feffing to arise from an extraordinary at
tachment to the cause of Liberty and Equa
lity, may in reality be traced to the common
(purees of private and private am
bition, perhaps at once the cause and efteft
of an implicit devotion to Frame, and an
antipathy to England, exceeding the limits
of a national resentment.
To men of this description, arguments de
rived from the 'obligations of natural jufiice,
or of written contractwill be perfectly nuga
tory. " Tfy? Rights of Man," will b? tl.eir
answer to tlie one, and 44 Liberty and Equa
lity," to the other. I apply therefore to a
principle of more efficacious operation in
their minds, if their own iniereft is in any
degree connected with that of their country,
and ask them what would be the inevitable
consequence of a war, with all Europe, ex
cepting only the present prevailing power iir
France ? The experience of the late war,
would perhaps, discourage an attempt on the
part of Great-Britain to conquer this conti
nent, but we have a (ea-coait of twelve hun
dred miles every where open to invafion â
and where is the power to protect it ? We
have a flourishing commerce, expanding to
every part of the Gfol>e, and where will it
turn when excluded from every market of
the Earth ? We depend upon the returns of
that commerce for in any necefTaries of life,
and when thOse returns (hall be cut off, where
ftiall we look for the supply ? Wc are in a.
great measure destitute of the defenOvc ap
paratus df War, and who will provide us
with the arms and ammunition that will be
indispensable ? We feel severely at this mo
ment, the burden of our public debt, and
where are the funds to support us in the
dreadful extremity to which our own niad
nefs and iniquity would reduce us '-âNot to
mention the infallible deft*uftion of our Fi
nances, and the national bankruptcy, which
the friends of tie fytfetn I am combating,
would perhaps* welcome a* a blelTing.âAie
Sir, imaginary appreheVlions, or are
thev oojefts of trivial moniej e* ? Our nation
al exiitence may deper J upon the event of
our' Councils in the p.efcjpr tiifis, and 10 ad
vise u* to engage voluntarily in the War, is
to s'V.i a flajSNr at tlic of the country.

this is our fii it delire. We know
this felicity principally depends on
a wife adminiltration of our finan

relation between a sovereign and
his fubjetfts ; and it is towards this
point that our firrt care and solici

had rendered us an account of our

seen with pleasure there were fuf
ficient funds for the exadf payment:
of all arrears and interests, as well
as of a reimbui (ement of all charg

France e)nancipat:il, comes to dfeliyer
you tiom those opprefi'ors by her
armies that pant for liberty and glo
ry. It is for Republics to efface the
arms of Defpotifin. Hiilory bears
witntfs to the unceasing efforts
which you once made to obtain your
freedom ; bur flie records also your
imprudence, founded, perhaps, on
gratitude, by which your fetters
have been rivetted. It is not enough
that you have wrested from the ra
vages of the lea, iminenfc advantag
es that have been devoured by En
gliih ambitionâyou muit also rid
yourl'elves of domestic tyrannies.
Your ancestors fti uggled for eighty
years againll the united forces qf
fupeiftiiion and defpotifui. Liberty
requires of you only a single day to
ettablilh completely your liberty
and independence.âGoverned for
ages by foreign powers, you ought
to be weary of being transmitted,
like live stock, in foccelHon, from
the Iloufe of Huiuauitto that of Ba
varia , and tram thence to the houseof Burgundy, iâ¢â¢ order to be trans
mitted 10 the Houies of Aultria and
I,allay. .
A Captain General of the Uniretl
Provinces, petitioned by the tlatcs,
is become your matterâyvur ty
rant â  and thus it is thaT you have
Jolt all ill givingyour confidence to
one man. Your anceltors law iu
your S;adiholder only the firlt fub
jedt of the Rate ; the guardian of
vour liberties: but even in ihofe
goodly times â¢your Prince was none
other than a despot. The' heredi
tary chief of a republic is her natu
ral and mod formidable enemy.
The firll act, therefore, of the
French Republic, will be to oettroy
the ancient government. It is ne
cellaiy to deltroy totally the roots
Â»f ihe Stadtholderare, if you v illi
to prevent their fli-jdting forth,with
new vigor. There is in your annals
a folenin editft of adjuration and of
independence, which put an end to
the tyranny of Philip. You said,
" Men were net made for Princes, but
Princes for Men they out to be
calhiered, when, instead of defend

mies. Let the people proclaim the
declaration of rights, to aboliih the

have, under a thousand pretexts,
prodigalized to the house of Naflau,
to deltrpy the ancient ariftocracy,to
aboliih the sale of mankind, prac
tiled in the midlt of joii, in the
name of your Eaft-lndia company,
a traffic more infamous than prcfiing
iu England, to organize a Ample
and economical government, to mo
dify or to suppress unjust taxes on
the firft neceflaries of life, to main
tain their immense credit, to which
all Europe is associated, to consoli
date public faith ; âfuch are the
articles of peace and alliance which
the French Republic offers to you,
such are the benefactions of liberty
and equality ; such are the conditi
ons which we flipulate for the hu
man race, proclaiming its omnipo
tency, and aliening its rights.
In facl, what is your Stallholder ?
âa Captain General becomes a mo
narch, a fubjetft grown into a maf
rer, a tribune swelled into a tyrant,
a pupil, an ally of those Brunf
wicks, one of whom devours your
commerce in India, whilst the other
has enslaved your Republic, and
dared ro pollute your territory.
What is your Stadtholder then ? â
a servile Parasite ofthe Englifli,who
dictate their laws to hini, and to
you also ; a vaflal of Pruflia, who
obeys her bayonets & her intrigues ;
is it such an authority as this that
you would maintain ?
Re-trace the honorable pages of
your hilfory, and fay, if theliigheft
degree of your glory and prosperi
ty does not date from that epocha
when you firft had a republican ad
mintftration ; fay, if it was not that
free form of government which ex
cited the envy of foreigners, whet
ted the hatred of the House of O
range, and lighted up the war of
Kings ? That epocha, for you will
this day be renewed. Courage and
virtue will be a better defence for
you than a Stadtholder. Liberty,
courage, and virtue, such are the
true chiefs of Republicans, which
can never be fatal or dangerous to
them,
To destroy all the vestiges of ihat
hereditary authority, created firft
by gratitude, and terminated by ty
ranny, will not be fufficient ; liber
ty cannot permit the hideous traces
of feudality, of nobility, or roagif
terial aristocracy, to dwell amonoft
yon. The liberty of persons is no
thing, without the liberty of lands ;
they mull he enfi anchifed. The
pealants are every where the most
zealous defenders of republics. The
momentary exercise of the revolu
tionary power cannot alarm the Ba
tavians. How can those who have
jiot been afraid of eternizing the
despotism of a Stadtholder, not for
a moment confide in a great and
free nation, who will but regulate
the firft emotions of liberty, CTulh
every party that would opptefs it,
and tender abortive the birth of
anarchy. You will not liftentothe
calumnies of your enemies ; they
know that it is the intention of
*Vance neither io domineer over,
or enilave any nation, but torcitore
its sovereignty to it. Revolutions,
to be productive of good, ought
well tp be organized, and we bring
to you but the fruits of our experi
ence. To every resolution a provi
sional power is uiay
well temper the excels and
of perfdhal interest, and ttep the
rapiSwy of the diforganizaiion of
the ancient order of things, replace
for a flioit time eclipsed authority,
and check the devaluations oi anar
chy.
Commercial jealousy if one oftfce
courgcs of e;irth, and we will de-
Iroy it.âLilten to your brave an
eflors, you, the proud fellow coun
rymen of Ruyter, ceal'e to bow tin
ier the yoke of a foreign power,or
nider the weight of doineltic op
jreflion. deteflation of slave
y ought to ferment in every Data
â  iari heart. For you to enjoy the
idvnntages of civil liberty, is not
"ufficient ; for it cannot be secure
without political liberty also.âSeize
his epocha, when a great people is
jroclaiming the Rightsof Man, and
>f nationsâand learn to unite your
elves to your brethren, that you
nay seize again poflTefiion of your
ights;
Slavery has ages of duration, li

unity. Break, iienceforth, that
mpious alliance, formed with the
'3 mi lies of tyrants. âThe shout Â«f
iberty has harrowed up their fools.
Toarins, generous Batavians ! those
who (hall spill their blood and ex
pend their treasures, will be true
creatures of your independence.â
Unite yourselves to France in the
combat of defpotifni ; the Republic
will defend your liberty like her
own, and will never lay down her
arms until it shall be confirmed.
There is a holy coalition between
all nations worthy of liberty, until
every species of royalty shall be a

orders General Miranda to present himfelf
immediately to the Convention, to give an
account of his conductâand they have direct
ed Dumourier to take the proper Heps on the
occasionâby the second decree, they have
considered the army of Louvain as under a
diforp;anization, through the means of some
difaffedted persons. The army in general re
quires, that penal laws shall be passed, and the
cmnmiiPries sent citizen Danton to Paris to
solicit the Convention on,this subjeCtâby the
third decree they have sent to Paris, and have
suspended the colonel of the 73d regiment of
infantry, who for several days was ordering
the volunteers and sundry battalions of the
army, to disperse from the main body, con
trary to the dire&ions of Gen. Dumourier.
The Convention has confirmed the fa d
three decrees, and ordered Miranda and the
said colonel to be brought to their bar.
The niinifter of war has sent to suppress
the insurgents who infect the department of
Mayenne and Loire, 22 battalions of infantry,
2 regiments of cavalry, ij general officers,
and 53 pieces of ordnance. These are in
ftrufted not to answer to the conspirators in
any other way than by the fire of their guns,
aad not quit their posts until they have exter
minated them.
Three adminiftratlve bodies of Nantz, in
form, that for ten days past the country was
opprelTed with insurgents. The cityofNantz
alone has been preserved. These insurgents
were in number near 4000, and covered a
space of three leagues near the environs of
Nantz.
A letter from the commandant of the na
tional guards at Nantz, was since received
and read in the Convention, which mentions,
that the insurgents had been puriued, and
their chief was killed with many others, so
that the whole body was dispersed.

PETERSBUGH, (Vir.) May 3.
By Capr. Morris of the ftiip Bland
ford, arrived at Bermuda Hundred
from Glasgow, which place he left
the 2jth of March, we learnâThat
orders have been sent to the Gover
nors of the federal counties of the
kingdom of Ireland, to seize the
ordnance belonging to any military
' within their diftri<fts,
Government â¢'having deemed it ex
pedient, as the (landing army in
Ireland is adequate to its defence,
that armed bodies, not of the ap
pointment, or under the coiuroul of
his Majesty, fliall no where be fuf
fered to appear in force.âThat 011
the 12th of March, in the Britilh
House of Commons, on motion of
the Attorney-General, leave was
given to bring in a bill on the sub
jets of a traitcrous correspondence with
France, in which it was proposed to
make it high treason to fell,deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to the per
sons at present exercising the fo'e
reign authority of France, their ar
mies, navies, or fubjetSs, any naval
or military (lores, coin, bullion,
corn, clothing, or other neceflaries ;
as also for any Britifli fubje# to
'purchase lands in France, or (lock

of mortgage.
SALEM, Slay 7
By Capt. Byrne, from Martinique,
we learn, that that island is (till un
happy from its internal di(TentionÃ.
The Planters continue v eir attach
ment to the ancient vnineut,
and oppose by force the Patriots.
On the ijth of April, a company of
Whiles, and another of Blacks,
were sent by the Ariflocrats to a
place near Fort Royal, where they
intercepted a boat, and took prison
ers three Patriots of note ; they
also seized and carried oft*a consi
derable quantity of ammunition,
in confequetice of this provocation,
two columns marched from Fort
Royal on the i6th, under Gen. llo
chambeau and M. de St. Cyran,with
a grasshopper in each column. At
9 o'clock the General's column at
tacked, and a Ikirmifh of two hours
ensued : they dislodged the Aristo
crats from their out polls, and took
their second in command prisoner.
On the return of the patriots, M.de
St. Cyran was shot dead by one "of
his own detatchment, who alledged
that he was ati Ariltocrat. Twelve
of Gen. Kochambeau's men were
wounded in the ikirmifl) with the
Arillocrats, 3 of whom died before
Capt. Byrne failed, which was on
the t 7th.
Tliere is 110 regular force at Mar
tinique :âThe Patriots do 15 days
jtury in turns,and with.much cheer
lulnefs and alacrity ; being deter
mined to defend the island against
any attack ; though ftiould the En
glish make one, a diversion would
be made in their favor by the Aris
tocrats, whowifh.and probably have
solicited, their protection.
The Committee of Safety at St.
Pierre is eon fiii uted upon ti ue equa

BOSTON, March 8.
Yesterday arrived the fcip Chirlottt,
Capt. Mackay, from London. By this
ship our attentive London corrcfp,,âd cIU
has continued his communication of pa
pers, &c. to the the 3 d of April, inch

Official intelligence of the battle of
the 18th is publiflied. Both fides fuff er .
Ed much. The loss of the comhined for
ces icoo killed, 3000 wounded. The
French in killed, wounded and milling,
loft 7000 men, 32 pieces light artillery.
The capture of the artillery is of little
confequtnce, except as evidence of vie
tory.
In thea&ion of the I rÃih i2o,ooomen
were at times engaged.
Gen. Valence was rtot killed, but bad

the 18th. He was carried to Brutfds.
Counter Revolution in France.
The entire stoppage of communication
with France, which has jufl taken place,
neccflarily deprives us of intelligence from
that quarter. To what ciicumftance this
sudden lefolution of the French rulers in
to be attributed, we cannot fay. It is,
however, probable, that the interruption
of a communication so evidently advanta
geous to themselves, has been occasioned
by fbme circumstances of a domestic na
ture, the knowledge of which they were
desirous of withholding from us as long
as pofiible. We know that in Brittany a
very formidable infurre&ion has taken
place, which was well conduced, and ap
peared very likely to spread into other
provinces of that unhappy kingdom. This
may have occasioned a confidcrable fer
ment at Pan's, and have produced in ad
dition to the deplorable intelligence re
ceived from the Netherlands and the banks
of the Rhine, a frefli efftrvefcence and
new scenes of desolation and raaflacrc.
LEYDEN, March 26.
We arc informed by advices from
Heufdeii, that on the 22d intt. between
11 and 12 at night, a detachment of the
Swiss regt. of Gumoens took by affsiik
the strong battery which the French had
eftablilhed at Raanfdenk ncai Gertruy
denberg. r Fhe French abandoned ail
their artillery and warlike ammunition,
and had not eves time to spike up their
cannon. This fuccefis will doubtless facili
tate the attack against Gevtiuydenberg,
which is said to have been invested on the
23d by the Piufiians and Dutch troops
united.

The French troops left this town for

1 have caofed the military law anil courts

u It is with great pain, citizen Hii'iifter,
that 1 communicate to you an account of the
check which I have received. You mud have
Teen, by. my letters of yesterday, t'.ut my 9'V
feritiments are I >ut too truly jnftitied, on. Â£\-
count of" the news which I have received'X,
the dangers at Nsunmy in the approach of a
corps of about id,003 men, who directed
themfelve* towards BrufTells and Louvain.
I had doubts that it would not have been iw
my power to prefervÂ© the public good, with
out d'.{lodging, the .enemy from the camfi*it-
Nervengen. I have made, in consequence,
an attack on the left wing of the enemy ; ivw
centre diviiion made their attack on Nerven
gen, and my ieft, commanded by Miranda and
Cbampmorin, attacked the village ;
Ihe right, and centre of the army had some
fuccef ;, although the infantry was twice re
pilled, and driven iaom the village of Ner
vengen. The ei't wing proving unfortunate,
their retreat was made with confufion till be
hind Tirelemont, or perhaps a little further;
The MareOiaU de Camp Mielen was killed,
who commanded the artillery, and two gene
ral officers were wounded in the flight, and
fundrv pieces of cannon taken, amongfl which
there were three 12 pounders.
â¢" I was ignorant of this derangement, and
I had prepared an attack for to-morrow to
complete vi-ftory. And uneasy at not hear
ing from Miranda, and barring minimus
that he had retired, I quitted the victorious
p,trt of the field in the evening, to learn the
situation of the left w~iug, and was afioiillhed
it >t to find'one of the corps on my way to Tir
lement. I gave order to Miranda to resume
hi* pufi <m St. Margarita tÂ»cÂ»*
ver the retreat.
" I fend you, citizen, minister, a letter
from Vilence, who was wounded ; and who
is now on his way to Bruflells. laiti going
back to the eamp of Louvain to cover Bruf
fells and Malines. -1 cannot d.llimulate that
the evil of disorganization is at its I
fiar for the event of this retreat, in a coun
try, where we have aggravated tiie inhabi
tant-;, by pillage and the ii discipline "of tie
troops. I will do all I can to save the army,
who place in me the utifioft confidence, and I
will abide by their judgment 1 will submit
myfelf to the most severe examination, and
I will demand a court martial to judge of my
cohduft. Two happy if the facnfice of my
life can be of utility to the glorious cause of
Liberty! and I {hall fight till I die, or am con
demned by the patriots. I fear not the judg
ment of my Fellow Citizens, or the reproach
ofpofterity. You will fee that our loss hi
been confiderabje, about 2DOO men. I mufl
pass the utmod praise on the braved foldiei <
of the uÂ»iverfe, Imt we are in -want of eÂ«pe

" I beat the enemy, on the 18th, all day
long, in the famou r . field of Nervinde. The
enemy left us poiTeffion of the field. When
I had learned the cowardice of my left wing,
the enemy wanted to attack my right wing,
which was commanded by Valenceâthe cen

wing. The right and centre sustained the
combat. âI have, in the pre/ence of the ene

" You wi!! perccive by the papers how

The 2d was on the 16th, 1 and 18th

The accounts of it were received here on

it was published here by authority. So

broke out in the (hop of Mr. Morrow, gunfmnh,
in Third near ChÂ« fnut-Sireet, in the neighbor

office of the Secretaiy of ihc Treasury. The
wind was at N. E. and fortunately almotl calm,
but the fire raged with great violence and gain
ed considerably before the engines could be
brought to check it : about two o'clock how
ever the flames were nearly subdued.
The principal futtereis on this occasion were
Mefl". R. Mason, Morrow, Douglafs, Craig,
Shively and Hay.
The fpiiit of the citizens was never more con
spicuous than on this occasion; their a&ivity
was united, and under Providence, exerted to
great effect. â Several buildings enveloped in
fire, were in a manner snatched from the ra

H,h an J ATgilj l*rk â '
THf. lta Cis r.ioll onjuitly attacked; th- - r "
rUftryof thrfl.-iKwlity is invaded,ami the arm,
ol ih. em my iMve ui-erpe4tedly met with, a .uc
cels which migiit extend to the cities .luvir.g
voices in the state, and the conlequences ot
which niit'Ut be incalculable.
Such. High and Mighty LorJi, are the dan
gcrawhi.h either hatraf" us already, Â° r "
still inenatc uÂ». It iÂ» not my with to difkmble
tl.em : I do not even wiih to flatter myfell that
the bile. Â«e have already fuftai-ed will be the
last. It is not I'orpr.fing that th s Republic ihould
exp.neucc . r at checks at the
of a war; but in the midst of these disasters me
ricvates hcrfek, as if her losses awaken her ac
li/iry, (upport her courage, and multiply h.r
strength.
As little as the dangers of the state fliculd be
diff-mblei, so little ought her advantages and
succours to be mifunderllood. The situation ot
the country, interfered by rivers, canals, and
holds out advantages capable of dilputing
with thi enemy even were their successes (hit
more conGderable. The fidelity of th<4 citizens
their love for their country, js equally efficaci
ous in a republican state. The troops of the
republic are lull of courage, and burn with a
z:.'al to try their strength in the defence of thsir
altars and ft re Tides. The seamen are animated
by the very f;iritthat has never failed so honor
ably to diftinguiih the Dutch on an element
which is natural tÂ»them, and on which they
have lb often coil founded the pride of their ene
mies, I ou.fht finally to assure myfelf, that not
pnly the allies of the state, but alio the formida
ble powers, which equally with the republic,
have but ene interest and one common triemy,
will unite their efforts to ours to rep-1 from the
frontieis of this republic violence ai d injufti-e,
But high and mighty lords, I found my confi
dence more especially in the sovereign arbiter of
the world; who, out of nothing, has caused
this country to attain its present strength, and
who haspreferved it by miracle, and supported
the arm of my courageous predeceflors. 1 his
God is eternal. His all-puissance, his sagacity are
equally so, and he is still desirous of supporting
those who repose their trust in him
Upon these foundations it is th it I declare, in
the face of the whole universe, that far from be
ing discouraged, I will watch till my last mo
ment in the defence of the state ; and that, not
withstanding a part of my poilefTions and do
mains is already occupied by the enemy, what.
Qontinues to be mine, as well my blood and
my life, is still for the service of the state.
Let the nation rouse itfelfâh*t it lorm an
union with me against an enemy desirous of
seizing on its liberty, its property and its inde
pendence. I trust to be unceadngly found in
the career of honor and the love of my country,
and since I neither seek nor know no other
grandeur than that of the country, I shall esteem
myfelf happy, provided Heaven shall deign to
direct and bless my efforts to that end.
