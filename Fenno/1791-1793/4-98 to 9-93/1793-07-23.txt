A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEUNpAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 34, NORTH FIFTH-STREET, PHILADELPHIA
[No. 117 of Vol. IV.],
FOR THE GAZETTE
Hints refpetting a projetf for cflablijh
ing unto erf at p tact with the Indians.
TliE purpo'e of the following observations
is not either to criminate or panegyrtfb
themeafores of the national government ref
petting the Indians; it is to J*Â£geJl Jome con
fJerntions relative to Indian affairs, with views
i'.ry d'jfergr.t from those 0/ party. But, as my
ibul revolts against the fiavi/h dojftrines that
militate agaioft liberal difcufiion. I purpose to
express my sentiments in the spirit of free
dom ; while I repeat that decorum which is
due to t.*!? enlightened mind of America.â
And I fhsll fir.<i advert to measures which
hava already beeu proposed or adopted for
maintaining peace with the Indians.
I. The giving nf presents to tbe Tndians, is
a measure which has been sometimes employ
ed. l'arhap; particular cireumftances may,
an certain cases, advise its adoption. But it
may "be questioned whether this* measure* al
though the practice of European powers
should seem to recommend it, i.*, on the
whole, beneficial. Its advantages are at
least temporary and precariousâand perhaps
it tends in tbe event to encourage in the In
dians a disposition to depredation.
The ncifure of fending clerical mijjunaries a
mong the Indians has had its patrons- The ,
zeal with which this measure has been in
foine inftaoces patronized, may be considered
arguing moregooduefs of intention than
reach of thought, or acquaintance with the
history of society. I do not however objedt
: to the meafbre, but only to the miscalcula
tion of its relative place and importance. Of
itfelfi it appears inadequateat piefent, to the
objeS of maintaining peace with the Indian:.
3. Ntfpciatit* is one of the resources. This
msv be a valuable auxiliary, as conducive to
eonfidend in any other light, it-may d. ap
point the hopes of the pu'jl c. I will mention
of fie efficiency of tieaties iFitii the Indians.
After the war in which the French are now
engaged had extended to the principali/ime
Posters of Knrope, and had consequently be
come immediately intending ,to the Arru-ri
can commerce, the Prelidynt of the united
States announced to his fellow-citizens, t.iat
national difpofiton which is declared in the
national treaties and laws; publicly proclaim
ing, for the information and bfmft of the
citizens, the importance of abftaimrg from
ill acts inconsistent wit'i that friendfhip and
impartiality, which the faith of tieaties and
the authority of the law enjoined : And in tlie
fame proclamation, he gave public notice of
the determination to execute his officii and
sworn duty. Yet even this nv.-afure has not
escaped animadversion, and the lanÂ«na';
cenlare. Such aniniadverfion', when pro
ceeding from misguided zeal, and not from
psrfonal d fappointment, may indeed be re
garded with a peculiar indulgence and gene
rous compiflion, as being the erratic effulions
iof an ardent paflion for liberty. But, u 3
Ineafure clea.lv con.t'tutional, and wifely Â»-
'dapted to gnarcl against the i.fraction of trea
ties and the psblic law, is censured, even in
a country so enlightened and liberal as tie
United States, and by perlons claiming t.it
character of American citizens ; can it hera
tinnal to repose implicit confidence in tie ef

The pre cedin re marks point to the prin
cipal expcdientsrhich have been relied on
for keeping the idians in pejee. And taken
singly, or in conjnCtion, they do not appear
to promise thatjrompt and complete cita
blifhment of peat which is 'definable lor the
United States, jbefe general remarks argue
the difficulty of pcompliftiing this defirabie
object ; as well a the propriety of adopting
filch further expedients as the importance and
the difficulty of tfe o'ojeft may demand.
Is there then no other measure which may
bs adopted, and tvaich will aid and accelerate
the main of tbe arrangement now in
operation? Before suggesting a fpecific an
swer to this question, 1 will luccindtly men
tion fonie generai ideas.
To ejlab-ijk unwjai prace with the Indiant f it
appears impoi tsjnU that order, government,
civilization, fhifhfl taLe place among them.
This con fide ration immediately opens into
an extecfive field of enquiry. I d& not
purpose at this time to Purvey and particular
ly delineate the whole ; but limply to point
to some of the main obrje&s of attention. I
maltonly ftetcirf&metbing of an outline with
out even pretending to complete the repre
sentations. Persons conversant in compre
henfiye views of human affairs mult be sen
sible of the variety of particulars that would
require attention in minutely investigating
the fubjeft ! But, a 1? the present design is to
throw out only futile hints for public confide ra
tion, the observations will be of a general na
ture, omitting a multitude of particulars.
Ail opinion has, in lo me tnealurc obtained,
Th?.t it is impracticable to civilize the red
people on the bord% :s of the United Stater..
But the fmaH effect of* past attempts for this
poroofe does not appear to warrant the opini
on. The progrWt of mankind from rudeness
to iiumanization is wfoaliv flow, much flower
than a partial obfcrver.of &ciety would be
apt even to imagine.
11 is,' I acknowledge, no easy matter to
form a true estimate oi the- space of tvne which,
in the general course of events, must elapse,
before any people having no connexion wirh
the moit civilized of mankind, would
emerge from t'.ie rudeness ot lavage life and
advance to tfhe civilization, the arts and
humanities of poliflied focietr. Perhaps the
ffacc of a thoujand years is considerably ftoi t
ot the truth. Let a person consider the rude
ness of nations on the continent of Europe iO
L.te as the fifteenth century, and even late: â
then recur to the accounts to be found rela
tive to the fame nations in the writings of
Tacitus, or Caesar ; and further consider the
length of time whichthofe nations must have
existed, at the periods to which these writers
refer ! This view of .only a part ot mankind
may abundantly evince the very flow, and al
mo'ft imperceptible progress of the human
nice from savage rudeness to civilized con
ditions.
It also appears credible, that tfcis progress
in its earlier rtages is much less pei ceptiole
than in its periods. '
And there is one general consideration whicj
applies very univeifally to the progress oi ci
vilization As far as my recolletfbon now
extends, kijlory has not recorded anx people thÂ«t

FROM THE WESTERS STAR,
PuHiJhei at Stockb ridge (Mass.) by L. Andrews.
IT has been justly observed, that the terms
" Liberty and Equality" have been-fla-
grandly perverted, by the conftruftion given
to them by some who make great pretentions
to pat riot Km and political sagacity -âLiberty
gives the privilege of enjoying in peace and
security the fruits of indnftryâit opens, wide
the doÂ«>r to honorary preferment, to those
who purfu? the paths of integrity and politi
cal rectitudeâit favors the diflfemination of
that knowledge which enables the community
ta diftingui!h between real and pretended me-
rit, and which dire<sts the public attention to
the former, whether found in tbe low wall'd
cottage, or in the lofty edifice of wealth and
affluence.âLiberty invests a people with the
right of ele&ing their own rulers, whose tafe
hto enadt laws for the general goodâand it
enjoins upon thÂ» community a ftri<st and punc
tual obedience to them, without which, nei
ther private nor public happiness can long be
considered in any other view than as empty
founds.âThe aforementioned ate among the
many privileges which are allotted to a nati
on whose citizens rightly observe and use the
advantages which freedom and independence
place within their reach-âFor fucb .liberty
oar heroes foughtâfor fuc i liberty our mar
tvrs lei!âfor such Hberty our patriot* have
performed the duties of the cabinet, and fueii
it long be our happiness unmoleft-
Equality constitutes a barrier
aflumption of undelegated power
â the fame lecurity for the protcftior?
of the middling and lower class, in the exer
cife-nf tlifer righfi, as it does to the rich and
affluent, and renders the feat ofjuftice accef
fiii.j to all ranks of citizens- 'cvtr hor'tjl
blit weak and uninformed charafterr, propa-'
gate an idea that liberty confiftj in every
man's doing that which is inoft agreeable to
the dictates of inclination, whether conform
able to the laws, or not âthat national regu
lations, calculated for the wisest purposes,
must, without giving time to experience '.heir
e3eft', be rendered lubfervient to the wbims
and caprice of a set of compluiners, who have
filHicient art to deceive the uÂ»wary, and hafe
neiVimooeh i--'
discontented with the operation ot a fee and
iuft government. The views of the i aft men
tioned are, to introduce dil'order and cor.fu
fion, that, am'idft its raging, they may them
lelves leize the holm ol powerâthis effected,
their tone would alter-âar.d while they foug.it
piincioallv their own aggrandizement, the
people would be called on to obey their nail
ciates, as the infallible oracles of political rec
titude. What thefedemagogues, before their
exaltation, would ftifc? liberty and equality, viz.
(he right of the populace to aftemble ando\ c i -
awe the proceedings ot the freely eie<ficd I'-
gifhtors of the nation, they would afterwards
declaim against as unlawful ar.d seditious.
But the former ideas, when once generally
diifeminated, efpeciaUy among an, uninform
ed multitude, are apt to carry their influence
beyond the controul of reason, 2nd finally pro
duce the mod alarming cont'equenccs. âUn-
happily, this line ofconduft has been too much
purfueJ by our Gillie allies, whefe noble ftrug
gies in the cause of human nature cannot but
j be intereftjng to every American.
Those who delight in the diffufiqn of that
bappinafs concomitant on the establishment of
Wire and wholesome laws, must heartily wifti
that the original principles which induced
France to throw off the fetters of tyranny,
may yet inspire them to the pursuit of thole
measures which are neceflary to secure liberty
,nd its bleflings on a just and permanent foun
dation. There are those who condemn as
Arijtocnts, all who do not join in the huzzas of
a Paris mob, and unhefitating'.y approbate the
proceedings in into of the French Jacobin club
lj U t many, very many, who think that the
conduct ol the former is difgraceful, and that
of the latter hostile to all true principles of
liberty, pray with more honest hearts for the
fneeels of the great cause of freedom, than
thole who accuse them with being favorer.s of
Arjhcracy, (3c. (3c.âBut these declaimed mujl
have a cant phrase, and Arijlccracy will an

than anv other.âA(k i'onie of this class for a

FOR THE GAZETTE.
FRANCE, the rival time immemorial of
Great-Britain, had in the course of the
Â»4r, which ended in ] 763, fuffei cd from the
fuccersful arms of the latter the severest loT
fes and the molt mortifying defeats. Britain
from that moment had acquired an alcend
ant over France in the affairs of Europe, and
in the commerce of the world, too decided to
be endured without impatience, or without
an eager oefire of finding a favorable oppor
tunity to destroy it, and repair the breach
which had been made in the national glory.
The animosity of wounded pride conspired
with calculations of the interest of the State
to give a keen edge to that impatience and
to that desire.
The American Revolution offered the oc
cafidn. 11 attra&ed early the notice of France,
though with extÂ»eme circumfpe&ion. As
far as countenance and aid may be prcfumed
to have been given prior to the epoch of the ac
knowledgment of our independence, it will
be no unkind derogation to aflert, that they
were mark neither with libera!fV, nor
with vigour ; that they woÂ»e the appearance
rather of a desire to keep alive difturb.-rnces,
which would embarfafs a rival power, than
of a serious design to aiSft a revolution, or a
serious expectation that it would lÂ»e effected.
The victories of Saratoga, the capture of
an army, which went a great way towards
deciding the ilfue of the contest, decided a-lfo
the hesitations of France. They established
i:i the government of that country n confi
dence in our ability to accompli Hi our pur
pose ; and as a consequence of it produced
the treaties of alliance and commerce.
It is Impossible to fte iu all this any thing
more than t'J.e csrtduft cfa rivalnation, em.
'b'racing-a fltnft proraifing opportunity to re
press the- pride ,ancf diminifli the
power iif its riv'^l; <jv recording a IVectfiFul
fcfiitaaCi to Its authority, and by - foflpinff off
a Valuable portion of iu dominions. Xl'e
difmemberinetit of this country -from {Jrleat
fiitain was "art diwimwatul a very imporfmt
intertft cf France. It cannot bÂ£ doubted,
that it was tbe determining motive, and ajt
_ademLizc_Â£ompeiifatiou (of the at-.
Menoffenfe, in country, deduced an
encouragement tÂ«Â» the part which their zeal
for liberty prompted chem to take in our rer
volution, from the probability of the co
operation of France and Spain. It will be
remembered, that this argument was i.fed in
tlie publications of the day ; but upon what
was it bottomed f Upon the known compe
tition between thole powers and Great-Bri
tain, upon their evident interest to reduce
her power and circumscribe her empire ; not
upon motive, of icgard to our interest, or ol
attachment to our caue. Whoever should
have allcdged the latter, asvgrounds of the
expectation he'd ontj wmild have been then
juftfy confidercd as a visionary, or a dc-ceiver.
And whoever lhall now ascribe the aid we re
ceived to such motsves would nor deserve to
be viewed in a better light.
The inference from these fa&s i? not ob
scure. Aid and co-operation founded upoij a
great Wltercft, pursued and attained bv the party
affording them, is not a proper ilock up?n
which to engraft that enthusiastic gratitude,
which is claimed from us, by those nho love
f ranee more than the United State*.
This view of the fubjefi, extorted by the
extravagancy of such a claim, is not meant
to disparage the just pretensions of France
upon our goed tviil. Though neither in the
motives to the fuccouVs which she
nor in their extent (corifidering how power
fully the point oj honor in such a zvar xc\u forced
the confederations of interest when she was
once engaged) can.be found a fufficient basis
for that gratitude w!!;ch is the theme of so
much declamation : Yet we shall find in the
manner of affording us those fcccours just
cause for our efteeci and friendship.
France did not attempt, in the firft in
stance, to take advantage of oyr situation to
extort from us any humiliating or injurious
concessions, as the price of her afliflance ; nor
afterwards in the progress of the war, to im
pose hard terms as the condition of particu
lar aids.
Though this course was certainly dictated
by policy ; yet it was an honorable and a
magnanimous policy ; such a one as always
constitutes a title to the approbation and es
teem of mankind; and a claim tathe friend*
ship and acknowledgment of the party, in
whose favor it is practiced.
But t'.iefc sentiments are fatirfied on the
part of a nation ; when they produce sincere
wilhes for the happiness of the party from
whom it has experienced such conduct, and a
cordial disposition to render altgocd auj fiicndly
cjfitr* u'hnk can h rtnieni ui'tiort prejudice to iu
curt Jwii urdpermanent inttrejli.
To alk of Â» nation Co situated, to rr a Ice a
facrtfiee of substantial interest ; to expofc it
felf to the jcalcufv, i'! will, or lefentmentof
the reft of the workl; to hazard in an emi
nent degree its o-.vo tjl'erv. for thebenefi'ofc
thi p 1 rt v , wlio may have observed towardaK
mm|he conou& which has been
would be to alk more than the nature of the
cafe demands, mcfrc than the fundamental
maxim* of l'ocicty anthorife, more uau the
Oufcates of fviiM reulo;i juil:fy.
A nueition has anicn, with regard to th?
prujkrf o jett of th-t giatitude, which ts so
nUKaiÂ«UiiteiUfegon ; whether the unfo'lunate
2 7 i nice by wkUuni the alliltance received was
given ; or the nation of whom be was the
Chief o. ciie organ. It interests the national
justice to form right conceptions on this
point.
The arguments which support the latter
idea are as follow.
44 Louis the XVI was but the constitution
al agent of the French nation. He acted tor
and 011 behalf of the nation ; 'twas with their
money and their blood he fupportedour cause.
'TU to them therefore, not to him, that our
obligations are due. Louis the XVI. in ta
king our part was no doubt actuated by State
policV. An absolute prince could not love
liberty, iiut the people of Fiance patron
ised our cause with zeal, from fyinpathy in its
objsiA. Tlie people therefore, not its mo
narch arc entitled to our fyinpathy."
This reasoning may be ingenious, but it is
not founded in nature or J*Â£l.
Louis the XVI, though no more than the
conftitut-ional agent of the nation, had at the
time the ible |)ow#r of managing Â» ts affairs,
the legal right ct" dire&ing its will and its
forces. It belonged to him to uilift u*, or nÂ«t,
without consulting the nation ; and lie did ai
jiil us without futh consultation. His will
alone wa; atliyc \ that of the natiop pajfivc.
If there was any kindness in the decision, de
manding areturnof kindhefs from u c , it was
the kindness of Louis the XVI ; his heart was
the depotitory ot the fcntiincnt. Let the
genuine voice of nature then, \in per verted
by political fubleties, pronounce whether the
acknowledgment, which may be due lor that
kindness, can be equitably transferred from
him to othe'rs, who had no Ibaie in the de
cision. Whether the principle ij gratitude
ought to determine us to behold with indif
ference his in fortunes, and with
the triumphs of his enemies.
The do&riue that the Prince is only the
organ of his mition is conch*live to enforce
the obligations of good faith between nation
and nation ; in other words, the obfcrvance
of duties stipulated In treaties for national
ptw poles âand it will even iuifice ro continue
to a nation a claim to the friendlhip and good
will of another resulting from friendly offices
done by its Prince ; but it would be to carry
it too far and to render it too artificial to at
tribute to it the eifefit of transferring that
claim from the Prince to the nation, by way
of opposition and contrift. Friendlhip, good
will, gratitude for favors received have so
i life parable a reference to the motives with
which and to the persons by whom they were
rendered, as to be incapable ot being trans
ferred to another at hn cxbenct.
From the New-Tort Daily Gazette
MR. M'IEJN,
EVERY benevolent heart niuft be
agitated with mingled fenti
metus of compafÃnn and horror, at
the late we!] authenticated accounts
of the maflacreof eight or ten thou
sand white people, men, women
and children ; and the total de-
Uruiftiou of tlie city of Cape-Fran
cois. And what has occasioned this
horrible carnage and devaiiation ?
It appears, ft&in whatVve havebeen
able to learn, that it originated in
a dilputc between the coinmifiioners
Sontbonux and Polverel, and the
Governor Galbau, all acting under
the authority of the National Con
vention. Galbau, it teems, had been
received at the Cape, and inltaied
in the government, before the ar
rival of the commissioners. This
was deemed by these kuutbls Citizens
an infringement of their authority,
a deprivation offome part of their
dignity. To support their cause in
oppofkion to the Governor, the mu
lattoes are introduced, the negroes
are excited to Wft the arms out of
the hands of theii mailers, and a
general deitru&ion of tlie defence
lefs inhabitants eufues without any
diltinCtion of sex or age. These
are the men who talk so much of
equality ; but when they come to
aÂ£l, we find that, rather than en
dure the lead luppofed diminution
of their power, they will hazard
the total demolition of a great and
flourilhing and the/bedding
of the all its inhabitants.

â¢5NEW-YORK, July 9 .
Captain John Kanning of the brig'
Union, arrived on in 14
lisys from Cape-Krancois, gives us
ihe following melancholy particu
lars refpetfting the fate of that un
happy Island.
" On theiSth June the civil com
iniflioners, Mefl'is. Sonthonax and
Polverel, arrived at the Cape from
Port-au-Prince; they immediately
suspended M. Galbaud, the Govern
or and Commander of the troops at
that place, and sent him on board
Ihip; on the tÃth a number of mu
latroes were encouraged by these
gentlemen to come into the town,
who by unfair means armed all the
negroes belonging to the citizens,
and encouraged thein toatfill ih de
ftroying the whites, which scene,
it is said, actually begun on the 20th
about noon, when a moil horrid
inafiacre ensued, neither women nor
children were (pared, upwards of
10,000 white inhabitants were but
chered, and about 2,Â£Gofaved tliem
fetves in the French and American
vefi'els in the harbor ; the wretches
then hegan to plunder the townâ
after whiiith they set fire to it, and
on the 22J w hen Captain Fanning
failed, the burning was going on,
Â»ud there was only the church, go
vernment honf'e, de C a feme and
Gregarie saved ; they left there the
A neriqtie of 74 guns. Capt. Fan
ning failed in company with about
J{o tail of vertels, bound to differ
enr pons in America, under convoy
of two French 74s and 4 frigates,
who were bound, as supposed, tu
Bij/ton or Newport, so that we may
soon cxpetft to hear of their arrival,
On Sunday lad he fell in with the
Ambuscade, off jiarnegat, who de
tailed him for three hours, and
then ordered hiui to procecd on.
Capt. Fanning's regllter and all his
pajiers were burnt at the Cape.
Cape Francois was a neat well-built
city, the buildings chiefly of ilone,
said to be as large as New-Yoit.
The large church has escaped the
flames, being all of stone, and co
vered so as the fire cannot make a
ny impreffiou. The government
li .life biis fuiFered much 110111 tbe
cannon-(hot ; the fuldiery were still
engaged in fighting in town. It is
supposed that this difaflerous affair
proceeded entirely from the differ
ence between the tw'o cotnmiffioti
ers, who aff'nmed the power, and
Governor Galbaud, who thought his
rightful authoiity invaded. He
he-aded a number of sailors from the
ihips, who made thefirlt attack, and
repnlfed the mulattoes, but having
at hand a number of negroes with
arms, they repulsed the sailors and
whites.
Capt. fanning observes, that he
could have carried off loads of plun
der when he came away, as the in
habitants had left their houses and
property to lave their lives. Capt.
Fanning parted with the fleet the
30th Juue.
Philadelphia, July 15.
The President of the United
States arrived in town from the

On Sunday last arrived at Baltimore the (Hip
Atlantic, Captain Hugh Wilion, in 6 wecksftom
Lisbon ; by whom we learn, thai, when he Tail
ed, there was m that port, ready for sea, a fleet
of 16 ships of the line, which, it was reported,
was hound to Fcrrolâ that the French AmbafTa
oor tailed from Lisbon to Havre-de-Grace in
the ihip Columbus, of this portâThat French
men who were heard speaking favorably of
French politics, were immediately committed
toprifon That on tVe ad of May last, the
Princess royal was delivered of a daughter, on
which occasion every house in the city was
Splendidly illuminated for three nights, as was
also the lhipping in the harbor, and decorated
with the colours of different nations ; the ad
miral had 1000 lamps on board, and the leil in
proportion.
We learn from Baltimore that a French (hip
74 Buns8 uns arrived io Chefapeakebay,on Thurs
day week, from Cape-Francoia, and 5 bng of
20 guns, with 1100 passengers, bound into
Hampton road.âThe brig Lily, of this place,
was the fame day off Cape Charles, with several
other vcfffls unknown.
On the 2gth ult, arrived at Norfolk, Virgtma,
the Spanish brigaritine S.tnta Catalina, a prize
to the French l'choonei Sans Parcil, Cspt. Bou
teilie, carrying i4sfwiveis, and 50 men. The
privateer was out from Cape-FranÂ«us,
and feil in with the Santa Catalina off tnc
mouth ot Mantanraz, leagues to the leeward
of the Havanna, loaded with ccdar and maho
gany for the king'? yard at the Havanna. On
beting ordered to strike to the Fiench Republic,
Ihe Spaniard said he would not ; when the pri
vateer immediately fired into her, and five men
were killed, and the captain and four men
jumped into the watci from out of the cabin
windows, and we*e drowned. The privateer
took 5 vessels that day (June 12) viz. the above
brig and lour fchooncrs. On the 13th they
cjplurcd an F.ngliPo brig from Jamaica, her
fir It voyage, loaded with rum and iugar, which
they sent into Charlcfton.
On Turfday arrived here, the schooner Cleo
patra, T. Williams, rnafter, from Spain, and last
from Coiunna, in 52 o.iys. By this veflel, we
learn, that on May ill, there had been an engage
ment between Sr. John de Luz and Fayonne, in
which the Spanifli forces had ma wkh a severe
rcpulfe, and were driven back to St. Johli de
Luz, which is on the frontieis ; a-nd in their re
treat they were obitru&ed by a river, and not
having a fuffieienr number of boats, they were
forced to fwim,and great numbers were drown
ed. The quarters of the Fr< nch army be
ing at Bayoi>ne, after the engagement the French
troops retired so 'hat placeâtheir number in
that gariifoti confiitsof a formidable army.
It is reported, fays a c'ojrefpondejit, that
seven or eight British velTels have failed from
this port since the commencement of hostili
ties between France and England, with a
greater number of guns, Brc. than they had
on board when they arrivedâand that this
has been known to the minister of France.â
However this may be, we do not hear that
any representation on the fubjeft has been
made to the executive of the United Statesâ â¢
At any rate, we may reft atTured, that no
tr*irtfa6Hon whatever will be liiffered to pass
unnoticed on the part of the government,that
interferes with the ilri&eft neutrality on the
one hand, or an honorable recognition of the
rights of treaties on the other.
The following very exirjordirtatv observations
art* copied from a piecc (igned. " Jul a," in the
National Gazette of Wcdnefday la It. The at
tempt therein made, fays a correspondent, to
make a diltin&ion between the reople of the
United States and their own goVrrnnjent, is per
ktUy hollile to every rcpunlican idea ; and the
exhortation to the Minilter of France, is little
Ihort of a piopolitiou ta transfer ail trie powers
ol the executive to a foreigner. It is evident
from this fampie of the politic* of a certain
party, thai' their objcÂ£t is a diAblution-of the
Union. the extract.
" The Minister of Fiance, I hope, will aÂ£l
with tirmnelV and with fpmt. The people are
hiÂ« friends, or the friends of France, and fie will
have nothing 10 apprehend ; lor as yet the peo
pic are the fovcreign of tiÂ»e United States. Too
much complacency ifc an injury done his cause,
for as eveiy advantage iS al 1 t*kcn of Francc,
{not by the people) further condescension may
lead to further abuies. It. of the leading
features of our government is pufilUnimity,
\fhcn the Brinih lion (bow's his teeth, let France
and her mmiiler ast as becomes the dignity and
jufttce of their caule, and the bono* and faith of
nation*."
In the General Advertiser, who
very ptopeHy G<;ns hirnielf " a Jacobin," fays,
"Itis no poflible to doubt, that the
intention of -the executive of the United
State*, is to look upon the treaty of amity
and commerce which exills between France
and America as a nullity, and that they aie
preparing to join the Jeague of kings agamft
Fcanoe." What a gullti that can jwtUow this!
It may be that when the trea
ties with France were formed, it was said
that fonie of the articles were ambiguous.
This appears to bave bem a well .founded
for tho' it was well known that
ââr coininiffionei's would never have dared to
lheÂ«r their faces in this country, had they
mad, an exf!,c,th treaty-yet n now
appears, according tea lineal expohtlon, that
this was infolded to be tne tafit.
It may be laiely aftirnÂ»c4, that the lies are
as ten to one in the account current ''t be
ween the friends and enemies ol ntutrtlili, tÂ»
tlie debit of the latter.

The manufa&ure of Morocco-Leather has
been brought to a high degree of*perfection in
this state. The red, black, green, and other
colours of Morocco-Leather which is now
exposed for fa (e, and was manufactured by Mr.
David Callagha*,merchant in this city, is said to
exceed any imported from Turkey. The
expence which has been incurred in bringing
this manufacture to its preterit date, is very
considerable, and Weil worthy government*
encouragement.

The opinion of the President of the United

" I bc4icve the American Museum has met

opinion, that the woik is not only eminently
calculated io difleminate political, agricultural,

But that it has been uniformly conduced with ta/lc,
Attention, arid propriety. If to thefc important
