NATIONAL CONVENTION.
February 25.
T ALIEN, in tlie name of the com
mitt'ee of general f'afety, gave
in a report on the troubles which
prevail at pre'fent in the city of Ly
ons. Ihe sentence pronounced a
gainst Louis XVI. and his execution
had, he raid, filled the A'riflucratt of
Lyoiis with horror. Since that pe
riod, the tree of liberty had been
disgraced with insulting rnferipti
011s, and pamphlets had been pubi
lifhed with threats against the, Nati
onal Convention. 111 one of which
were the following words : " Treni
ble. Tyrants ! Remember that the
base murderers of Chailes I. either
all perished on the fcaflrild, or felt
by the hands of real Englifhnier."
He laid also ; the Aristocrats ex,-
prefied great joy when they heard
of the death of Le Pelletier ; and
that they threatened, at the fame
time, to set fire to Mom-Briton, a
city of that department, and to the
houses of two deputies who had vot
ed for the dea h of Louis. After
mentioning other facts, tending tc
fliew the ferment which prevails a;
Lyons, he added, that a counter re
volution was ready to be effeified
there ; that the central club of ast
the popular societies in that city had
been dispersed ; that their records
had been burnt in the public fejoare ;
that fire had been set to the tree of
liberty, which would have been ion.
fumed, had not the Sans Culottes
braved the poinards which threaten
ed them ; that the flatue of liberty
and of J. J. Rofleau had been nailed
to the sacred tree ; and that during
this counter-revolutionary ceremo
ny, the Ariflocrats had formed a
dance around it, in which the ladies
had made a conspicuous figure ; and
that the gates of the arsenal and of
the powder magazine were in the
hands of the revolters. He con
cluded with Hating,that every thing
announced thegreatefl danger ; for
the constituted authorities had written that they were 110 longer able
to do any good, and that they began
to despair.
The convention decreed, that 3
commiUioners from their own num
ber (hotild be fcnt with full powers
to atft as ciriumftances might re
quire, and ordered the executive
power to difpaich an armed force
futficient to rettore tranquility.
Alarming ft ate of h'arts.
He said there existed a great fer
ment among the people, and that
they were assembling in a tumult
ous manner in very large bodies,on
account of i he Icarcity of provisions.
He moved, therefore, and the con
vention decreed, that the municipa
lity of Pari9 fliould be authorized to
pursue such measures as they might
think necessary for reftoi ing order ;
even to cause the drum to beat to
arms if neceflary ; and that they
(hould every day give to the con
vention an account of the (late of
Paris.
February 16,
The affair of Lyons again occupi
ed the attention of the convention,
and several farther particulars, re
fpe<fting the disorders in that city,-
were stated : among others/ that
the counter-revolutionists openly
shouted out Long Vt.ve Louis XV-lf.'â
D n to the Municipality : Jtwti
wit A it. Two battalions, hpwever,
arriving there, a number of the
ring leaders quitted that place.
March 6.
Letter from the commiffiuners sent
to Belgium.
Liege, March 3, ,1793
Citizens our colleagues,
" As you will have laid before
you the letter which we have ad
d'refled to the national convention,
we fliall hot here repeat the con
tents of it. But we mud add, that
every thing is in a tnoft alarming
fltuation ; that the army which re
tired from Aix-la-Chapelle, and the
environs, is almost entirely dilband
ed ; that the enemy will perhaps
to-morrow, or perhaps this evening,
be in Liegeâ-in Liege, where all
our provisions are colledted, and
which contains inimenfe treasures !
We give this account from the in
formation of General Valence, at
whose house wc now write. He as
sures us, that if Dumourier him (elf
does not arrive, he canndt answer
for the conferences.
" We are endeavoring to rally
the fugitives, and are using oilr ut
most endeavors with the provisional
administration and the citizens,that
the people of Liege may second us,
and supply the wants of'our army.
The dangers resulting from this
want are so much the greater, as
the enemy are very strong in caval
ry, while we have scarcely any at all.
(Signed) Delacroix, Coujfin,
and Merlin de Dottay.".
When this letter was read several
members moved, that Bournonville,
the minister at war, should be called
to the bar.âBournonville accord
ingly appeared and said ; 1 receiv
ed yesterday from Gen. Valence dis
patches, which simply dated, that
the polls on the Roer had been forc
ed ; that a column of Prussians were
advancing towards Ruremonde.and
that another body of 10,000 were
marching against him. It is aston
ishing that the com'miflioners should
have been so imprudent as to give
fttch details. Were they real, the
generals would certainly have com
municated them to me. I have re>
ceived difpatclies also from Dumou
rier, who gives me only a very flight
account, of that affair. Yesterday
morning I dispatched a courier,with
orders to Valence and Miranda to
unite, and form a body of 40,000
men ; for should the enemy appear
before Liege, it would not be afto
nHhing to hear of its being taken
next day, as it is not fortified. I
hfive besides given orders to Du
mburier to lay siege to Maeftricht
in form, in fliort,. news coming
from fugitives is not entitled to cre
dit*; and it is impossible that the
commissioners could be properly in
formed of the derails of that affair
by men who fled."
Paris, Match 11. We are aflured
that the fitting of last night was ve
ry intfrefting to the committees of
the Convention. More than 80 per
sons prcfentâOanton and
Genfonnet set out this morning for
Belgium.
The dispatches from Gen.Dumou
rier are of the utmost importance.
A very serious atftion took place be
tween Bruflels snd Louvain, the de
tails of which will probably be laid
before the Convention to morrow.

' LONDON, March \l.
The secrecy, the vigor, the dis
patch, with all the other unremit
ting exertions, used by goverpment
since the French have thought pro
per to declare war against us, eor
refpond with their general charac
ter for wisdom and policyâThey
have, since that (hort period, silenc
ed and reftri&ed tl>e daring among
ourselvesâthey have purged the
land of foreign and insidious emis
saries, and put the kingdom in the
bell general state of defcnce. Equal
ly faithful to their allies, they have
sent effevflual succour to their aid,
and.by acling with a central 1 pirlt,
have given wisdom and vigor to the
councils and armies of Europe.
To such spirited exertions,under
God, we may attribute the late fuc
cefles in Holland, and by persever
ance, we may reasonably hope for
a continuance of them. The late
boast of Gen. Dumourier was, that
he would breakfaft in Amsterdam
the 17th of February lastâbut that
day is past, and no Dumourier is
arrived !
i The taking of Liege by General
Beaulieu is a mod important con
ijueft The magazines of the
French, and all the treasures of
which they had robbed the Nether
lands, were stored in this place.
Letters receive'd from Breda men
tion, that Dumourier found in that
fortrefs 187 pieces of cannon,â
200,000 pounds of 6,0c0
muskets, and a great quantity of
bombs, cannon balls, &c. Dumou
rier immediately set out upon an
important expedition, carrying off
a great part of the military stores.
Maeftricht is defended by 4,000
German troops, chiefly from the
duchy of Brunfwick, and 1,200
French emigrants, of whom the
greater part are officers. The Brul
fels Gazette, which now publishes
only what the French didtate, ad
mits, that the siege of this place
was found much more difficult than
was expetTted, and that the fire of
the garrison proved the fuperin
tendance of some able engineers.
After the battle of Jemappe, in
which very near 12,000 of the French
were slain, Dumourier informed the
Convention, that the day had cost
him three hundred men.
But how did this cunning Gene
ral afterwards reconcile this infor
mation to his conscience ? Thusâ
Upon being alked, when at Paris,
by an English officer who was pre
sent at the battle, how he could
have sent word to the convention
that that day had coll him onl) 300
men ? the General replied, that it
was exa&ly so ; for, added he, be
fore the engagement had been over
an hour, 1 hail near 12,000 recruits
sent to my army ; so that in balanc
ing the account of killed and receiv
ed, I found a deficiency only of 500'
menâwhich, therefore, was the Joss
of the day.
March 19
Mr. Hope, of Amfterdain, who is
now in London, received a letter by
yesterday's ma'il, which he conli
dered of so much importance as to
transmit to Ministers. It slated that
the Erince de Saxe Cobourg came
up with the French armies between
St. Tron and Louvain ; engaged
them, and gained a complete victo
ry, in which the French loss was
eflimated at 12,000 men. Their
armies were totally routed and dis
persed.
In addition to this, rumours more
vague said, that the Auftrians had
afterwards captured Louvain, and
were marching to Bruflels with the
certainty of taking it.
We state these reports without
giving them as facets. The name of
Mr. Hope gave weight to the story,
but it does not appear that the letter
received by him Hates the fatfi other
wise than as a report in Amfterdain.
The accounts from Paris, down to
Thursday Jail, ftatethat Dumourier
had come to take the command of
the Belgic army, but fays nothing
of this defeat.

Scarce had you proclaimed your own fover
cignty when the emperor and king of Prussia
took up arms against you, but now that you
have proclaimed your constitution to b'c repub
lican, there is not one despot who has not re*
solved upon your utter ruin. Those who have
not already forced you into open war, are pro
bably temporising, that they may the more
ealily deceive you, and it is but tod true, that'
the proje&ei ftrogglc is between the" enfrsn
chifed France and enslaved Europe.
Be that so, France must eventually triumph
if its will is firm and constant; for nations are
stronger than armies. Those who havo fought'
for independance were ever vuftors. Let Hol
land, Switzerland, and the United States, be
proofs of this afTertion.
Free nations find resources in their utmort
extremities and distress. Rome reduced to she
circumference of the capital, arose from defeat
more formidable than from vi<3ory.
Remember, Franks, your own eiploits,whm
the Pruflians dared to pollute your territory.â
Ever did the enthusiasm of liberty triumph ov
er numbers ; ever did fortune smile on the va
lourous enterprise, and victory on true cot
rage !
Franks,

of mankind, never was such a cause referred
to the ultimate decision of war. Not the inte
rest or concerns of the day is the theme, poste
rity and ages to come are the fubjefl; not the
liberty of one nationâno, the enfranchifemeot
of human species.

that the king of Spain had never remained nea

and that one enemy more would only be a pre

As a proof of the alacrity which the people of
England, notwithstanding their pteieiu internal
commotions, daily rtianifeft in carrying on the
war against France, Mr. Atkinfon, a paffengtr
in the Roebuck, mentions, that in tbeipaceof
a fortnight, while in Manchester, previous to
his cmbaiking at Briflol, not less than 300Â®
volunteers were raised, and seamen fiockea to

that in every pursuit and station of his life, he
was a&ive, intelligent and just. All his enter

with vigor and decision of mind. In domeftc
life he was affe&tonate, in friendfhip ardent and
(incere, in benevolence unbounded. The dis

ofhisrmnd : He was patient and resigned, and
finally yielded his foul into the hands of
Creator, in full a flu ranee of cn'ein>g upon the

The amazing diitame between the fdvage and
civilized Haltâ 'he d:H *rcut means of procuring
fubhUeiic:âilie ufujl habns of living peculiar to
CdJÂ»âthe various mode* of cduc<uirtn âthe oo
polite qualifications that ptocurc cittern and re
tp?Â£t, sad the pccjfioual and coullant eino.oy
menisof the two (Idles, render Â»u imiuidiatt
-Opinion nnprathcable.
Yhc'e cireumilauces, with the fpint of hosti
lity which early generated an enmity between
the two people, accelerated their ft-pa :ation, and
prevented ilic eftcCl which the Ipint of accom
modation might m oinci circumitances have
operated.
The Angle difference in procuring support,
uiuft, without achange*>f living, hav< iendered
the removal ot liic Lvagts mdifperilabie. As
the country is fettled, ihc timber Idled, habna
c 10us eretted, and lands occupied and cultivated,
those animals which luruilh the with
their principal support decay. ThVy have heen
\ed therefore by the calls of nature and neceflii v,
rather thao by Â«>ny concert r fcheine ol policy.
Their removal pieced them at once beyond the
reach of improvemcn:. While in the neigh
bourhood u! a moie civilized and (ocial people,
they would more easily become acquainted wiih
the advantages vyhicb they enjoy, and more rea
dily adopt their am, ihcir manners and way of
living. By a frequent interchange of go;>d of
fices, and daily obleivation ot the security and
abundance of their support* with the numerous
advantages of arts, of agriculture, ot inltruments
litid of industry; they would gradually drop their
prejudices; become more kufible of the attrac
tions of society, and at length embrace the; habas
arid improvements of civilized life.
The civilization of a baibarous nation indeed
can only be effe&ed by flow degrte*, even when
coudu&ed on proper principles and uniformly
prosecuted. Yet we can hardly conceive it pos
sible for a people, under so many favorable cir
cumftances,to remain long without making some
advances towards more agreeable and improved
locicty.
But when, instead of remaining near the
whites, they withdrew beyond the reach ot
society, it became impolTible lor tliem io derive
any benefit from the knowledge of their arts,or
the ir.ftitutions which they might have commu
nicated to them.
The mortifying circumstances which caused
znd accompanied their removal, mutt have con
firmed their prciudices in favor of their own
manner of life, and augmented their aversion
from the whites. These prejudices they would
carefullv inilill into the minds of their youth;
and by bfir;; teoeatedly renewed and cultivated
into a habit, they become invincible. Thus
every new generation grows up with all the pas
sions, prejudices and enmities of the preceding,
and a foundation is laid for perpetual animosity
and variance.
These arc the principal caufcs which appear
to me to have retarded the civilzation of the In
dians; and their combined influence seems fuf
ficient to account for their present barbarity,
without having recourse to a supposed incapa
city for improvement, or to any other imaginary
hypothecs. LYCURGUS.

" This is a very ufeful work, and is 110 ill
proof of thejudgment and induQry of the author,
she rules are laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are lulikient lor their il
luflration. One part of the work deserves par*
ticular commendation. We mean that which
the author (files " Mercantile Arithmetic " It
occupies a considerable portion of his book, hut
not more than its importance will juftify. We
would recommend to' the young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to this branch.
Me will find its principles well explained. And
{hould he make himfelf master of them, he will
always have reason to acknowledge his obliga
tion to ihe judicious and laborious author. We
cannot but congratulate the riling generation on
account of the many.ufeful proiiuflions which
have lately appealed ; and in which Iheii im

Among thole produfiions we mult place this

THE Author is fcnfrble that the fi'ft edition
of his American Geography (which makes Part
I. of the above work) was in many inftanc.es de
fective, in other* erroneous, and in iomeoffen
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was hi*
desire, in the present edition, to fupplv the defi
ciencies, corrcft the errors, and meliorate the
offenfivc parrs of the last. To aflift him in this
business, he has received many valuable commu
nications from ihe heads of department in the
general government, and from gentlemen of re-
in the several Rates. The descrip
tion of foreign countries- (which composes Pa rt
11. of the above work) has been carefully com
piled from the rood approved writers on Geo
graphy, and ufoiul information introduced from
the discoveries of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and refpc&able authors. Indeed, no pains
nor cxprnfe have been (pared to render this woi <
the most complete, accurate, and ufeful of any
ever offered to the public.
