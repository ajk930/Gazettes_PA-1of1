Mfl. I>JGÂ£RSOL Tor the captors ? firft en
deavored io fliew, that the violation of '
one part of the treaty, by proceeding in this
cafe would annul the whole. To this effect
Ke cited -4 Vaf, Sec. 40. He could not re
concile the proceeding l ; of the Executive jp
arresting the prize and detaining her, with
the exf>refs words of our treaty of amity and
commerce with France. Even if the proper
ty was ,wre(led from our hands the Court
*vould not liave a right to declare the t prize
illegal.
from the Universal Di&ionary, paÂ£ell2
he read the word l ? of part of a treaty bstweer
France and the United Netherlands, in Tub
ft,nee nearly the fame as the 7th Â»rt. of cr
treaty with France, and at("o page 234., â¢
ofanother t e.itv, containing similar
on the oart of the HbellantS (he asked) to fitew
cases wherein a conftrqltion has been put up
on the provisions in the'e treaties similar to
that contended for. If none can be adduced,
the cau e surely cannot he supported.

Piew that it is the duty of him who is neutral,
not to interfere iii determining the question
'<â ' prize or no prize: 3 Grotius, chap. 9, Tec.
Sâfays, It is faid y that when the capture is
' >Und on neutral ground it forms an ekcep
ti in'; but Burlamaque combats this opinion.
Bynk, 191, 194 fays, it would be unfair
that a court Ihiufd have power to restore
without the power to condemn. In the caTe
now beTore the Court, it is not contended
that there is power to condemn.-âA faithful
pftfervance of treaties, he remai ked, is the
best mjthod r>f a'taining re'pe& and jireferv
irigpeice. A capture on neutral ground js
an offence to the neutral power ; but it be
longs to the Executive only to obtain redraft
by means of negociation ; the Executive is
the ftifly organ of goverrtmeot jyy which wc
-vith foreign nations.
Mr. Raw!.- had cited 3 Vat. fee. 132, to
ffiew that if a power at war attacked an ene
my ori neutral territory, a wrong is done to
the neutral country ; this he admitted Â£ but
he in fitted the Executive alone is competent
to demand reparation.
Many observations had been made by Mr.
Rawle, on the extent at sea of our territorial
Claim. He ditfered as to the extent of that
claim and conceived it more confined than it
was endbavn *ed to be laid dawn by that gen
tk"n*Y>.âi. Vat. p. 116, (ays, that the do
minion of a Rate is as far as is neceflary for
its fafety ; if the faÂ£ts dated in the libel were
fcoinpared with this rule, he conceived, that
bo jull ground of Complaint could be formed
by us. Oor treaty with France, the Ne
therlands, and Sweden, are indefinite on this
head,â" near the coast,'' is the expreflion.
The indefinite nature of the queflion ren
dered it a much fitter fubjeft for negociation
thm for a legal decilion.
He turned to the E-icyclopsÃdia, article

The quett'on. Mi. In : >erfol said, is a qnef
ti"u of priz- and no .riac, the very qucftion
fxr>ref'!y precluded by treaty. From 16
Viri'r. 603 It appcais plainly, that to give ju
tifdnSoii c a neot ai cvnrr of admiralty, it
mxifl: appear, that rhe con tries to which the
capto-s and belong are at peace with

to whom ue captors be'ong determine the

Grotius 601, was al'o quoted as cootaining a
cafe or opinion in point.
Mr. Sergeant on the fame fide.
Vattel Sates the great jcaloufy that *xifts
â¢etween belligerent powers relative to the
condti&of neutral nations, wlwtfc fliould bt
conleqiiently Â«Â«; y tauti-u-thujy tlwy, .ijj any

tral nat'oo ih.mld coofider both parties ?s
riftlit. frizes become the property of tlic o
tereigns> in a ciegree, who gave the com
million to the captors } they are not to be
meddled with ; bat cur treaty withf ranee is
explicit on t;hat fc?ad v
a Va?. Sec. 346 to 349, to down, that,a
oatipn has no right to judge between an indi
vidual and a State. Sec. 2(0 to tie
fame point nearly ; a neutral nation fcas no
right tofrt itlelf up as judge between belK
gerent powers unleft by tlip agreement of
both Rarfies. 4. Inft. lays down, as ift
â  Vin. 600 that before a ca% of capture can be
'brought before a neutral admiralty court it
must be lliewn, that the sovereign of Hie
country where the cause is instituted be at
peace with the countries where the parties
belong and that t|io/q countries are alio at
peace with each other.
Lee exjjrefsly fays that in cafe of uifuljti oft
to a'neutral nation, fatisfa&ip.n mull be
demanded by the executive and the buftnefs
fettled by'negotiation. If it was admitted
tiiat admiralty courts could interfere in cases
like the jjrefent, privai;csrs.cjrcumftauced as
the Citizen Genejt. js to be % \ypul4,
with their captures, ever keep out of the ju
rifdi&ion of those courts, and then the exe
cutive must at last be resorted to. One pow
erful reafop the executive should fettle
differences flrjfing from a violation of a neu
tral territory is, that having the public force
at their command, they can make those neu- ,
tral riÂ£?its more refpelted.
The counsel on the other fide appear to
fuppote that a republic pofTefles fewer of the
rights of l.bverejgnty because their,executive
is uot so energetical that in absolute go
vernments ; but Montesquieu fays well, that
in every sovereign State their exists tbe fame
quantum of power,âpower complete for feJf
preferf ition and the vindication of wrongs.
Hp adduced a recent cafe in point: An Kn
glilh merchannnan at the JEfaulkland l/les,
which are claimed by no nation aiul looked
Upon n$ common propei ty, flopped by a
Spanish sloop of war, her rudder blocked and
fails taken. through their cx-^
agent c T einSncted and obtained Â£on
cejfiions and reparations of damages.
Shall the Captain of a merchant
man, he asked, be the guardian; of our rights,
or rather shall not we undertake the task of
vindicating them without his interference ?
Suppose we should go into the merits of
this cafe and find that the capture is a good
one, the court however could not condemn it.
The cafe from Bynkerfhoek, he conceived
by no means in point; neither that from the
Code des Prises, as had been dated by his col
league.
Upon the whole, he recapitdlatcd, that a
neutral court of admiralty cannot judge be
tween belligerent {towers. That if tLere is a
violation of territory, the court of admiralty
cannot obtain red re hut that it must be lei t
to the executive ; that there is no instance
of a court at law vindicating the rights of
neutrality; th'at the injured party muff ap
ply to the fotereign ; and if we are iujured
we must fettle the bufmefs by negotiation.

" The French came to attack us
Vefterday in force. They were at
firft repulsed from St.Sauve. There
is reason to believe that their inten
tion was to turn tile left wing of
our army.
" It was determined to make the
second line march by Sebourq, Con

been burnt ; the enemy were heat
en and pursued as far as Famars."
<< Four divisions of Braco drove
them from Saten, and took from
them 6 cannon, with their horses.

200 men. Our ihafleurs ('tigered

The French have loft a number

waggons, we have taken from them
8 pieces of cannon, of which 4 are
four pounders, 2 eight pounders,
and onea 12 pounder, together with
a 14 pound howitzer.
" We wait for more circnmftan
tial details of this affair."
A very important action took
place on the ift inft. between a part
of the combined armies anil the
French.âOn the morning of the ift,
the French advanced a considerable
body of troops against the corps of
Pruflians under General Knoblef
dorf, occupying the pelt of Maulde,
and likewise against the body of
Aoftrians occupying the important
port before Conde. The relief of
that place was evidently the objetft
of the French. They meant by ad
vancing against the Proffian Gene
ral, and the advanced corps of the
Prince of Saxe Cobourg's army, to
keep them in check, while tliey
made their chief attack upon the
Auftrians, under cover of a large
wood of which the French were in
pofTellion. They commenced their
attack at five in the morning, and
between that and the evening made
four different attacks, the last of
which, the rnofr vigorous,commenc
ed at three, and was not over till
between fix and seven in the even
ing. The Auftrians (tood all the
different attacks with the otmoft
bravery and firmnefs. The great
ell part of them were engaged with
vnufquerry in the wood. General
Knoblefdorf detached several corps
from ' his poll to their affiftanre,
which he could do with greater fafe
ty, as lie was supported by two bat
talions of British from Tournay.
The French were at length com
pletely repolfed, and several pieces
of cannon were taken.
The lof's was confideralile on both
fides. The French were greatly fo
perior in numbers. They recreated
in corfufii.n tc F?.mars. Itvrasfup

IVaie that the city was perfectly
tranquil, and that nothing new had
occurred. The triumph of the Ja
cobins on the acquittal of Marat
was unbounded. In Briflot's jour
nal this acquittal is mentioned as
the ruin of France.
The French are said, from very
good authority to have ten fail of
the line at sea.
Accounts have been received frpm
Jersey, of the date of the 29th ult.
It appears that on the 23d, a French
fleet, under three frigates
of considerable force, flood very
close in with theifland, which occa
sioned the alarm guns to be fired,
and thebeacons to be lighted. The
French, however, towards the even

any descent. One or two of the
French ships flood so dole in, as to
fire on some of the batteries 011 shore.

Conde still holds out, but the gar
rison is reported to be in such
tress for provisions, that itmuftfoon
fall. All the heavy artillery end
ammunition will be before Mentz
by the jth of May. From that city,
the inhabitants, to the amount of
15,000, have been expelled by the
French, to prevent a famine. The
garrison has still some supply of corn
left, and a little horse flefh, but no
eggs nor vegetables. It is provided
with wine, which is drank abun
dantly by the French, who pull to
pieces the old houses for fire-wood.
There is no longer any hope of the
capitulation ofMentz. An attempt
has been made to inundate the
French mines near the city.
It is reported, that the Commis
saries from the National Conventi
on have ordered all the English;
merchants residing at Dunkirk, to'
quit that town in less that 24 hours
from the lft instant.
Private letters received at Brus

that Philip Egalite was carried back
to Paris ; thole who were carrying
him to Marseilles, being afraid of
meeting the Marfeillefe upon the
road.
The Empress of" Russia has taken
pofteffion of a considerable part of
Poland. She has attempted a juf
tification of her conduct, which has
much the fame truth and justice to
recommend it as the King ofPruf
fia's reasons for seizing on Danjzic.
The King of Poland was given to
understand by the Ruffian Minister,
that unless he attended the confe
deration at Grodno, Prince Louis
of Wirtemberg, would be appointed
by the Imperial court to succeed
kini on the throne.

Intelligence is in town from Paris
of so late a date as the 27th ultimo,
when all remained in sullen tran

for a fortnight. The royal family
were fafe and in health.

of that pÂ«wer.

since the last accounts receivedâ

The present commercial distress

does every thing he can to alleviate
it.
At the present moment of alarm
and distress amongst the mercantile
and manufacturing communities,
the Minister, with that vigilant at
tention to the trading interlls of the
country which has uniformly mark
ed his administration, has expressed
a wish to adopt lome plan that may
(lop the evil now existing, and give

reason to believe the faifi is so j and
that a very large proportion of mer
cantile houses, which have been
lately obliged to suspend their pay
ments, is ltill solvent, and well able
to pay every demand in the course
of time. At Manchelter, Liverpool,
and other large trading towns, par
ticularly at the former, this is
well authenticated ; but the failures
at the country batiks have flopped
the circulation of money so Sudden

" On Thursday last was brought into this
port, an E'iglifli sloop called the Providence,
from Montego-Bay, James Robertfnn, maftei,
a pr ze to the French privateer Le Vainrjueur
de la Baftile, Francois Henri Hervieux, com
manderâsince when thepÂ»ivaÂ«Â£r hcriclf has
arrived.
Â« 11 appears that the Vainquer de la Baf
tile, late the Hector of Philadelphia, waÂ« pur
chased in CharleJton by CÂ»pt. Hervieux, at,
officer in the French navy, who having,
through the medium of the Corj/ul-of the
French Republc rending in Charie/ton, pro
cured-a commission for his vefTel,' armed her,
and having caused the American papers be
longing to the Hector to be depnfitcd at the
Custom Houf; in Charleston, failed on a cruize.
ii That between Cape Fear and Cape Hu
man, at the distance of 4 <-2 leagues from
land, he fclhin with the Providence, which
he captured after having chaled hÂ«r some
time.
n Since Captain Hervieux's arrival, it
basing been rumoured that a certain Gideon
Olmftead, forme; lv the owner of the Hector,
had acted as an officer on board the French
privateer, at the time of the capture oi the
sloop, although sn American citizen, two
magifcrates of the county, in pursuance (as
they supposed) of the proclamation of the Pre
sident of the United States, thought proper to
i.Tue their warrant for apprehending of fa d
Olmftead âand, npon examination, conceiv
ed the evidence to beof a nature, and his ca>a
and fituatiop, such as defirrved to be Pubmit
ted to the cognizanc' ofthe Federal Judiciary.
They accordingly canfed Mr. Olaoftead to eÂ»-
ter into a recognizance in the ium ot 2oa|. for
his appearance at the next diftrtft court, to
be holden fur the diftrift of North-Carolina,
on the firft Monday in July next.
" Captain Hervieux is acknowledged to
have treated his prisoners with unusual gene
rosity, nor have they since their arrival in the
harbor, been at all restrained of their liberty.
" The Captain of the Briti/h sloop tailing
advantage of this indulgence, availed him
felf of the countenance and fopport he has re
ceived in this town, and by advice'of ton Tel,
has instituted an adtipn of trespass 3Tair.fl the
commander of the privateer Â»nd Mr. Olin
ftead, in the sum of 2000 L opon pretence that
the capture was illegal.
" Vexatious as is this suit, it v 11 cci'tainr
ly be produdtive ot the most fe >ous n con
venience to Captain Hervieux. who is iliii in
the custody of the (heriff, and .will probably
discourage that liberality in others which has
prompted his conduct in this circumstanceâ
since, far from releaiing their prisoners in
speedy humanitv, caution will tecic 1 the
French cruisers in future, the necelfit 7 of
confining, at leafl:, their English captives till
they reach the territories of the French re
public, or until the chance of war (hall bring
them'relief and liberty."
FOR THE GAZETTE.
Mr. Fenno,
AS attempts are making very dangerous
to the peace, and it is to be feared not
very friendly to the conftitutton of the Uni
ted Statesâit becomes the duty of those who
wifn well to both to endeavor to prevent
their success.
The obje&'.Qns, which have been raised
against the proclamation of neutrality late y
issued by the Preiident, ha*e been urged in a
spirit of acrimony and inve&ive, which de
monstrates that more was in view than mere
ly a free difcuflion of an importantvjpublic
measure ; that the difculfion covers a design
of weakening the confidence of the people in
the author of the ineaiure, in order to remove
or let Ten a powerful obstacle to the fuÂ£Cefs of
an opposition to the government, ,v bich how
ever it may change its form, according to
circumstances, seems still to be adhered to
and pursued with persevering indnftry.
This reflexion adds to the motives con
netted with the'roeafure itfelf to recommend
endeavors, by proper explanations, to place
it in a just light. Such explanations at lealt
cannot hut be fatisfa&ory to those who may
not have leisure or opportunity tor pnrfuing
themselves an invelliggtton of the fubjeft,
and who may wifli to perceive, that the poli
cy of the government is not inconsistent with
its obligations or its honor.
The objections in question fall under four
heads :
i. That the proclamation was without
authority.
2. That it was contrary to our treaties
with France.
3 That it was contrary to the gratitude,
which is due from this to that country, lÂ° r
the succours rendered us in our own revolu
tion.
4- That it was out of time and unnecc.-
fary.
In order to judge of the solidity of the fii ft
of these objections, it is neceffhry to examine,
what is the nature and design of a proclcma
tion of neutrality.
The true nature and design of such an act
isâto make known to the powers at war and
to the citizens of the country, whole govern
ment does the ast, that such country is in the
condition of a nation at peace with the belli
gerent parties, and under no obligations of
treaty, to become an ajfociate in the war with
either of them that this being its situation,
its intention is to observe a conduct conform
able with it, and to perform towards each the
duties of neutrality ; and. as a consequenceafih'ij fig; of tilings to give tracing to all
within its jurifdittion to aWfam from acts'
that (hall contravene those duties, under the
penalties which the laws of the land (of which
the law of nations is a part) annexes to arts
of contravention.
This, and no more is conceived to be the
true import of a proclamation of neutrality.
It does not imply, that the nation which
makes the declaratiou will forbear to pel form
to any of the warring pbwers, gny stipulations
in treaties which can be performed, without
rendering it an ajjociate or party in the war.
It therefore does not imply i<i our cafe, that
the United States will not, make those dif
tinaions, between the present belligerent
powers, which are stipulated in the seventh
and tweuty-lecond articjes of our treaty with
Frapce; because thele diftinftions are not
incompatible with a Itate of neutrality : they
will ill no ftiape render the United States . tin'
ajjociate or party in the war. This must be
evident, when if is considered, that even to
furnilh determinate succours of a certain num
ber of (hips or troops, to a power at war, in
consequence of antecedent treaties having no par.
ttcular reference to the extjlivg war, is not incon
sistent with neutrality; a polition well e(ia
bliihed by the doctrines of writers, and the
practice of nations.*
But no special aids, succours, or favors
having relation to war, not politively and
precisely stipulated by some treaty of the
above description, can be afforded to either
partv, without a breach of neutrality.
In stating that the proclamation of neutra-
Jitydoesnot imply the non-perfoimance of
any ftip'-alations of treaties, which are not of
a nature to make the nation an associate or
party in the war, it is conceded, that an ex
ecution of the Clause of guarantee contained
in the eleventh article of our treaty of alli
ance.with France would be contrary to the
sense and spirit of the proclamation ; because
it would engage us with our whole force as an
xjjveiatr, or auxiliary in the war t it wou'd be
much more tnan the cafe of a definite limited
fuccoui, previously ascertained.
It follows, that the proclamation is virtu
ally a manifeftation of the sense of the go
vernment, that the United States are, under
the cinumjlances oj the cafe, not bound to execute
the claule of guarantee.
If this be a just view of the force and im
port of the proclamation, it will remain to
fee, whether the President in issuing it acted
within his proper fpbeie, or stepped beyond
the bounds of his constitutional authority and
dutv.
It will not be disputed that the manage
ment of tho-affhirs of this country with fo
reign nations, is confided to the government
of the United States.
It can as little be disputed, that a procla
mation of neutrality, when a nation is at li
berty to keep out of a war in which other na
tions are engaged, and means so to do, is a
vjual and a. proper measure. Its main objefl and
ejfecl are to prevent the nation being immediately
ufponjihle Jor acts done b\ hs citizens, without the
â¢ fnvity ot lonntvanee of the government in contraven
tion ef the principles oj neutrality.+
An obje& this of tlie greatest importance to
a country, whose true interest lies in the pre
servation of peace.
The inquiry then is, What department of
the government of the United States is the
proper one to make a declaration of neutra
lity in the cases in which the engagements of
the nation permit, and its interests require
J'uch a declaration.
A correct and well informed mind will dis
cern at once, that it can belong neither to the
Jegiflative, nor judicial department, and of"
conrfe mult belong to the executive.
The legislative department is not the organ
ofintercourfe between the United States and
foreign nations. It is charged neither with
making, nor interpreting treaties. It is there
fore not naturally thaj organ of the govern
ment, which is to pronounce the existing con
dition of the nation, with regard to foreign
powers, or to admonifli the citizens of their
obligations and duties as founded upon ,that
condition of things ; flill less is it charged
with enforcing the execution and obfe-rvance
of those obligations and those duties.
It is equally obvious, that the a& in ques
tion is foreign to the judiciary department of
the government. The piovince of that de
partment is to decide litigations in particular
cases. It is indeed charged with the inter
pretation of treaties, but it exercises this
fun&ion only in the litigared cases, that is
where contending parties bring before it a
fpecific controversy. It has no concern with
pronouncing upon the external political rela
tions of treaties between government and go
vernment. This position is too plain to need
being insisted upon.
It niuft then of necessity belong to the exe
cutive department to exercise the function in
question, when a proper cafe for the exercise
of it occurs.
It appears to be conne&ed with that depart
ment in various capacitiesâAs the organ of
intercourse between the nation and foreign
nationsâ a* the interpreter of the national trea
t:es in thrffe cales in which the judiciary is not
competent, that is, in the cases between go
vernment and governmentâ as that power
which i% charged with the execution of the
laws, of which treaties form a partâas
that wiiich is charged with the com
mand and application of the public force.
This viev>.of the fubjeft is so natural and
obvious, so analogous to general theory and
practice, that no doubt can be entertained ot
its justness, tmlefs such doubt can be deduced
from particular provisions of the constitution
of the United States.
* $He Vat el, Beak 111. Ch. 6. Sec. toi.
4 Seel'at el Book 111. Chap. 7. Sec. 113.
L?t u~> f?? then if cauftf for such doubt is
to be found in tj)ftt constitution.
"The article of the co'nftitution of
the United States, ffe&ion firft, establishes this
general proposition, that 44 the executive
power fliall be belted in a President of the
United States of America."
The fame article in a succeeding fe&ton
proceeds to delineate particular cases of exe
cutive power. It declares among other
things, that the President fha.ll be commander
in chief of the army and navy of the United
Srates, and of the militia of the several Rates,
when called into the actual service ot the Uni
ted States ; that lie fliall have power, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, to
make treaties; that Â»t shall be his duty to re
ceive ambalfadors and other public ministers,
and to take care that the taws be faithfully executed.
It would not conlill with the rules of found
confhu&ion to confjdcr thia enumeration of par
ticular authorities as de>ogatmg fiom ihc more
comprehensive grant contained in the general
clause, further than as it may be coupled with
express rcftri&ions or qualifications; as in re
gard to the co-operation of the Senate in the ap
pointment of officers and ihe making of treaties ;
which are qualifications ofthegeueial executive
powers of appointing officers and making trea
ties: because the difficulty of a complete and
perfect fpecifir.ationÂ«ot all the cases of executive
authority, would naturally diÂ£late '.he use of
general terjns, and would render it improbable
that a fpecifi cation of certain particulars was de
fined as a substitute for ihofe terms, when an
tecedently used. Yhe different mode of expfef
fion employed in the conftuution in regard to
the two powers, the legislative and the execu
tive. serves to confiim this inference. In the
article which grants the legislative powers of the
government, the exprrlhons are, 44 All legislative
powers herein granted, fliall be vejled in a Longrefs
of the United States." In that which grants the
executive power, the expreflions are, as alieady
quoted, 44 The executive power shall be
velled in a Prefidenc of the United Stales of
America."
The enumeration ought rather thfwffore Id ba
considered as intended by way of greater cau
tion, to foecify and regulate the principal arti
cles implied in the definition of executive pow
er : leaving the reft to flow from the general
grant of that power, interpreted in conformity
to other parts of the constitution, and to the
principles of free government.
The general do&rine ot our constitution then
is, that the executive power of the Nation
is vefled in the President; fubje& only to the
exceptions and qualifcations which are exprefled
in the inftrumerit,
Two of these have been already noticedâthe
participation of the Senate in the appointment
of officers, and the making of treaties. A third
remaim to be mentionedâthe right of the legif-
lauire " to declare war & grant letters of marque
and reprilal."
With these exceptions the t x ecutive pow
er of the Union is completely lodged in the
Prefiderit. This mode of construing the consti
tution has indeed been recognized by Congress
in formal a&s,upon full consideration and de
bate. The power of removal from office is an
important And since upon general
principles, for reasons already given, the lifurng
of a proclamation of neutrality is merely an ex
ecutive ast; since also the general executive
power of the Union is veiled in the President,
the conclusion is, that the step which has been
taken by him, is liable to no jult exception on
the score of authority.
It may beobferved that this inference would
be just, 'if the power ol declaring war had not
been vested in the legiflatiire, but that this power
naturally includes the right of judging, whether
the nation is under obligations to make war or
The answer to this is, thÂ®t however true it
may be, that the right of the legislature to de
clare war, includes the right of judging whether
the nation be under obligations to make war or
not, it will not follow, that the executive is in
any cafe excluded f/om a similar right of jodg
mcnt in the execution of its own funÂ£lions.
If the legislature have a right to make war on
the one hand, it ?s, on the other, the duty of the
executive to preserve peace till war is declared ; |
and in fulfilling that duty, it mud neccrtarily j
poflefs a right of judging what is the nature of '
the obligations which the treaties of the coun
try impose on the government; and when in
pursuance of this right it has concluded, that
there is nothing in them inconsistent with a state
of neutrality, it become* both its province and
its duty to enforce the laws incident to that state
of the nation. The executive is charged with
the execution of all laws, the laws of nations as
well as the municipal law, which recognizes and
adopts thole laws. It is consequently bound,
% by faithfully executing the laws of neutrality,
when that is the state of the nation, to avoid
giving a eauie of war to foreign powers.
This is the direÂ£l and proper end of the pro
clamation of neutralityâ It declares to the Uni
ted States their situation with regard to the pow
er? at war, and makes known to the coihmunity,
that the laws incident to that situation will be
enforced. In doing this, it conforms to an
established usage of nations, the operation of
which, av before remarked, is to obviate a re
sponsibility on the part of the wholefociety,for
secret and unknown violations of the rights of
any of the warring parties by its citizens.
Those who Â©bjeÂ£t to the proclamation will
readily adinir, that it is the right and duty of
the executive to judge of, or to interpret, those
articles of our trcati< s which give to Fiance par
ticular privileges, in order to the enforcement
of tbofc privileges : But the neceflary confe
quenreof this is, that the executive mud judge
I what are the proper bounds of those privilegesâ
what nghis are given to other nations by our
treaties with themâwhat rights the law of na
ture and nations gives and our treaties permit, in
relpeft to those nations with whom we have no
tieaties ; in fine, wha- are the reciprocal rights
and obligations of the United States, and of all
and cach of the poweis at war.
The right of the executive to receive ambaffa-
Jors and other public miniftcrs, may serve to il-.
uftrate 'he relative duties of the executive and
legifla-ive departments. This right includrt
that oi judging, in the cafe of a revolution of
451
government in a foreign country, whether (he
new ruK.-;s are competent ocgatfs of the national
w 11, mid ought to b lecogiiized ov not: And
v here a tie<ay antecedently exilts between the
United Siates and luch nation, that right uWolves
the power ol giving operation, or not, to (uch
treaty. For until the new government is acknow
ledged, the treaties between the nations, as tar at
lealt as regards public rights, are of coutfeiuf
pended.
This power of determining virtually in the
cafe supposed upon the operation of national
treaties, as a consequence of the power to re
ceive ambassadors and other public ministers, is
an important instance of the light of the execu
tive to decide the obligations ot the nation wuh
regard to foreign nations. To apply it to the
cafe ot France, it there had been a treaty ot alli
ance offenjxvc and defenfive between the United
StatrÂ» and that country,the unqualified acknow
jedgjnen* of the new government would have
put the United Stiles ttt a condition to become
an in the war in which France was en
gagedâ and would laid the legislature un
der an obligation if required, and there was
othtrvife no valid excufe,of exercifiug its power
of aeclaring war.
This serves aÂ« an example of the right of the
executive, in certain cafes,to determine the con
dition of the nation, though it may consequen
tially affect the proper or improper exercise of
the power of the legislature to declare vrar. The
executive indetd cannot controul the exercise of
that power further than by its exercise of its ge
neral right of objecting to all a6U of the legifla
tui* ; liable to being overruled by two-thirds of
both houses of Congress. The legislature is free
to perform Â«its own duties according to its own
sense of them ; though the executive in the ex
ercise of its conftituiional powers, may eflablifh
an antecedent state of things, which ought to
weigh in the legislative decisions.
From the division of the executive power,
there results t in reference to it, a concurrent au
thority in the diftributcd cafcs.
Hence in the cafe ftattd, though treaties can
only be made by the President and Senate, their
a&ijvity may be continued or suspended by the
Present alone.
Noobje&ion has been made to the Preftdeni's
having acknowledged the Republic of France,
by the reception of its minister, without having
consulted the Senate ; though that body is con
nefled with hini in the making of treaties, and
though the consequence of his ast of reception
is to give operation to the treaties hereio f ore
made with that country. But he is censured
for having declared the United States to be in
a Date of peace and neutrality with legard to the
powers at war ; hecaufe the right of changing
that (late and declaring war belongs to the legil
lature.
It defcrves to be remaiked, that as the partici
pation of the Senate in the making of
and the power of the legislature to declare war,
are exceptions out of the general " executive
power" veiled in the P/efidcnt, they are to be
construed ftriftly, and ought to be extended no
further than is eflential to their execution.
While therefore the legislature can alone de
clare war, can alone actually transfer the nation
fiom a state of peace toa ftateof warâit belongs
to the 11 executive power" to do whatever else
lUc ]*W3 of nations, co-operating with the trea
ties of the country, enjoin in the intercourse of
the United States with foreign powers.
In this distribution of powers, the wisdom of
our constitution is manifeftea. Jt is the pro
vince and duty of the executive to preserve to
the nation the blcflings of peace. The legifla
tÂ»re alone can interrupt those blessings, by plac
ing the nation in a ftateof war.
But though it'has been thought advifeable to
vindicate the authority of the executive on this
broad and comprehensive ground, it was not ab
fokitely necessary to do so. That clause of the
conilitution which makes it his duty to "take
care that the laws be faithfully executed," might
alone have been relied upon, and this simple
process of argument pursued.
The Pfffidcnt is the constitutional r. x ecu tor
of the laws. Our treaties and the laws of na
tions forma part of the law of the land. He
who is to execute the laws, must firft judge for
himfelf of rheir meaning. In order to the ob
servance of that conduct which the laws of na
tions, combined with our treaties, prescribed to
this in reference to the present war in
kut'ope, ir w<*Â» necefTtry for the Prelident to
judge for himfelf, whether there was any thing
in our treaties incompatible with an adherence
to neutrality. Having judged that there was
not, he had a right, and if in his opinion the
interests of the nation required it, it was his duty
as executor of the laws, to proclaim the neutra
lity of the nation, to exhort all persons to ob
serve it, and to warn them of the penalties
which would attend its non-obfervÂ«Â«nce.
The proclamation has been represented as en
a&ingfome new law. This is a view of it en
tirely erroneous. It only proclaims a fait with
regard to the exifiingjlaU of the nation, informs
the citizens of whÂ«Â«t the laws previously ellab
11fHed require of them in that state, and warns
thein that thefc laws will be put in executiou
against the infra&ors of them.

The opinion of the President of the United

" I believe the American Museum has met

opinion, that the work is not only eminently
