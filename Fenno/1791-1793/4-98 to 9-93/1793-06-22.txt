FROM THE. GENERAL ADVERTISER.
r F'f\lE interest which the citizens
-I of the United States mult take
in any question which may in the
Jeaft degree appear to implicate
their neutrality, has induced the
editor to colledt all the information
in his power respecting the cafe of
the fliip William, prize to the pri
vateer schooner Citizen Genet, li
belled by the owners of said ftjip in
the Di(tri<ft Court of the United
States for the Diftrkt of Pennlylva

The Ship WiL'iam.
At a JieW
the 14th June, 1793 âThe libel in
the aforefaid cafe was read, letting
furthâl'hat Robert Findley, jtin.
Andrew Buchanan, George Bucha
nan, James Hopkirk, Thomas Hop
kirk, J .hit Dunlop, and John Ban
natyne, all fubjet'ts of the king of
Great Britain, were owners of the
Ship WilliamâThat the said ihip
011 her voyage to Potovunack river
in the Hate of Maryland, at the dis
tance of nine miles from the coalt
of the United States, received an
American pilot 011 board ; that the
said ship continued the fame icourf'e
outil they arrived within 2 miles of
Cape-Henry, the Southern Promon
tory of Chefapeak Bay, in 5 fathoms
water, and as near the shore as the
pilot thought proper to convey the
Ihip, when she was forcibly seized
by the Citizen Genet, commanded
by Pierre Arcade Johanene. The
libellant then proteltingagainfl and
not admitting the said schooner Ci
lizen Genet to be duly commifiion
ed, infilled that according to the
premifcs the said ship William was
at the time of her being so taken
upon neutral ground, within the
territorial jurifrlic'tion and under
the protection of the United States.
âConcluding with 3 prayer of res.
titution of ship and damages.
To this libel Pierre Arcade Joha
nene appeared on behalf of himfelf
and crew of the Citizen Genet, and
pleaded to the jurifdidiion of the
Court, stating that neither the law
of nations nor the treaty of amity
and commerce with the United
States and the French Republic gave
cognizance to the said court to in
teifete or hold plea refpecfting the
said ship and property. To this
plea the owners of the said ship en
tered their replication, and ilfue
was joined ther eon.
Sketch of the Pleadings in this im-
portanMCafe.
Mr. Dupouceau, on the parr of
the concerned in the Privateer, o
pened the cause. He, after a few
preliminary observations, turned to
the 171 h ariicle of our treaty of ami
ty with France, to (liew ihat it ex
pressly prohibits our raking cogni
zance of prizes brought iiuo any of
our ports by the French. This ar
ticle of the treaty he remarked, on
ly renders the obligations of the law
of nations on this point lirongei ;
una as the treaty secures mutual ad-
Vantages to the two nations, if cer
tainly (he continued) is entitled to
eonfiderable refpetft, The French
are now at war, it is true, and the
â Americans at peace, therefore at
this particular time, it operates mod
favorably as to the former, but a
period may come when Americans
in their turn' may be involved in
war, and find feveraJ of the stipula
tions in said treaty of confideiable
importance to their interests.
Hr nexc entered into a cumprc-
htnfive view of the gci'eral nature of privateer
ing, to (hew that none of out Courts can tiike
cognizance of aÂ£ls committed by either of the
belligerent powers o<*ainft each other. Priva
teers obtain commissions, the nations to which
they belong, alone, can take cognizance of their
proceedings under those comnriiflTions, and an at
tempt in a court o! any .neutral* power to inter
fere is an iilfi ingeaient on the sovereignty of the
state that granted the conimillion. The govern
ment of ail civilized counties cftabLfh tribunaii
for the trial and condemnation of pn*- s captur
ed by their privateers, and in those â courts Â»c
---drefs can be obtained, neutral property, hrough
them, will be rHlored, and all matters adjusted.
He turned to Magens to shew an inftauce in
which the piinciple he wifticd 10 tftablifh was
involved. Englilh privateers had seized and
cameo into port Prulliau vcff -ls. (Piuifia being
a neutral power) for having enemy's property on
board ; fbefe seizures were tried in the Enelifii
courts, and fÂ«>me of the property condemned,
and fume not. The Coim of Pruflia, thiough
their mi rafter, expressed to the Englilh Court
their rtilpleafure at these procccdiugs. Mr.
Mitchelf, the Pruflian minister, injifttd, that the
Englilh had no-right to try this pioper y, that
4be (hips ought to be cotifidered as part of the
territory of the nr.tion to whom they belonged ;
that wherever a nation could extend her protec
tion, so far did her territory extend ; that lhips
were as much a part of the territory of a nation
as forts on the boideis of the lea ; the PruHidiis
in their own lhips were perfectly at home ; that
therefore it was agiinft the law of nations to seek
for enemy's property on board, and that since
the qucllion related to the law of nations, at any
rate ihe courts ps England had no light to eieÂ£l
themfclves as judges, and that the bu fine fit could
be properly fettled by negociation only. In ill
Magens, page 463, Mitcln li's representation to
the Duke of Newealtle is recorded. For the
answer, fee .page 487. Mr. Duponceau proceed
ed to ftatc, that in confquence of England's
judging n this cafe, Pruilia proceeded to coun
teract her procerdings by liquidating the da
mages on her part and fecurtng their amount.
This proceeding of Prufiii was geneially com
plained of the courts,of that country to whom
the capture belonged had a right to give a d'ecri
fion in the cafe. So in the cafe before the court,
he contended, the courts of admiralty to which
the capture belonged, alone had a right to deter
mine the cjueflion of prize or no orize.
If the cafe involved a violation of our territo
ry? it belonged to the fov reign power of the
United S aics to seek redress by negociation,and
on the principles of the la at of nations the ques
tion would be determined. He cited 2. Byn-
Kerfhoek, 177, to shew that if we ast in an hos
tile manner againll our enemies on the territoiy
ot a friend of both paities, the offence is given
to tl.e sovereign that has power over that terri
tory.
Libel filed,
Ke cited Woodifon's second leflure, 425, to
prove the fame point.â-Hp referred to the 4th
Cooke's ii. failures, ijs, to {hew, that before the
merits of a cafe of capture on the high fcas cia
be brought in the court of a neutral country, it
must be (hewn, that the country to which the
capture is brought is in a ftaic of amity and
peace with the parties, and that the foveieigns of
(he countries to Which the parties belong, are 41-
so in a state of amity and peace.
1 he cafe before the court involved a queftiqn
of violation of the territory of the United States,
the action is brought by Briiifh fuhjecls and the
court prayed in a collateral manner 10 determine
a queltion in which the fovereiguty of the nation
is concerned, without giving an opportunity 10
that nation to be heard in its behalf. The Bri
tish fubjr&s who conceive themfeWcs aggrieved,
he said, had two remedies. In the fiift place
they might apply to the courts in France,where
a candid heating would be had-, and where fe~
curity was given by Capt. Johanene in the sum
of 50,000 livres, to arifwei any demands for da.
mage* wrongfully committed. Their fccond
remedy was an application to the Executive of
the United States ; they could tell the Execu
tive, that in conlequence of a violation of the
territory ot the Union bv a Frcnch privateer, we
arc immediate fuffcrt rs, we demand protection
and expe6t redress.
It would then be incumbent on the Executive
to bring the bufmefs before the proper tribunal,
and a decifson would be obtained by negociati
on with the agents of the sovereignty of France.
It would be, he remarked, for the good of
mankind, if a tribunal could be cftablifhed, hav
ing the fame relation to all the powers of the ci
vilized world, that our federal courts have to
the several dates, or that an analogous institution
in Switzerland has to the separate Swiss Can
tons : such a tribunal would often be able to fet
tle disputes, for the determination of which na
tions now fly to arms. But in the preferit (late
of things, nego iaiion is the only means of de
termining these national queitions; in the re
cent cafe of the (hip Grange, these were the
m ans âtKe ess â¬t is known.
This cafc wouid have embarrassed any court
of justice in the United States ; but inthecourfe
ol ..micahle ncgociation it was fettled 'O the fa
tisfad'on of the United Siiit*. No doubt if the
present cafe had been cariied to the fame tribu
nal, an equitable decifiou would also have ob-
tamed.
He turned to ?.d Vattel. ch. Â§ y fct 7. 65, 66, 67,
68, to ihew. that nation* h-ivc a 'igfrt to do
justice ; when justice iÂ» Tcfufed ; bul
wot a tight intheti.-ft inftdnce 10 attempt to do
therofelves justice the medium of their
own tribunal.

,V. ">ext adverted to the treaty, and Obfer-ed
generally, that treaties should never be
to forced interpretations. He turned to ad Vat
tel, ch, 17. to enforce that opinion Vattcl lays
it down, thai no part of a treaty Ihonld be fuf
fered to be interpreted which is plain without
interpretation.
Hff took notice of the effeÂ£iof a breach of one
article of a treaty, 2d Vattcl. ch. 13, f.ivs in
strong terms, that the violation of one clause of
a treaty renders null the whole, not only because
of the connc&ion between the fubi<-& ofvarious
clauses, but because elaufes very <ilflirtiilar are
often nratually granted by way of comptomife,
find therefore the breach of one tends to destroy
the balance intended by the framers of thetreaty.
He recapitulated, and Hated as the result of
his argument : That prizes IbouJd be tried in
the court of the country to whom the captor be
longs ; that a neutral power has no tight to en
quire into the validity of . prizes brought into
their ports, and expressly so oy treaty, as it re
lates to France and the United States' ; and that
queliions in which the sovereignty of .States is
involved can only be fettled by negociation.
Upon thefc grounds which he had endeavored
to elucidate, h<schent pleaded to thejut ifdiclion
of the Court.
He cone Med by tha*. if the pre
fect application to thÂ«S court was fuccefsfu!, we
might in a iimilar circumftancc he involved on
the other fide, and after having offended France
by an encroachment on her sovereignty, off, nd
Gicat-Sritain in the fame way. He closed by
forne observations on the importance of keeping
clear of the disturbances which agitate Europe.
M. Sergeant, before the court adjourned,
wiPned merely to turn to some authorities omit
ted by his colleague. The present contest is
between Englifli fubjc&s and Fiench citizens,
and the United States have no immediate con
cern in it. Independent of treaty; the law of
nations does not allow a thiid power to judge
between two nations at war. 1. Vattcl s. 18,
and 3, Vat. s. 191, to this point. 2. Inft. s. 335,
'38, *39, to the fame. Douglass, p. 56c, lays,
no cafe of an admiralty court of a neutral nation
attempting to judge between two belliger- nt
powers i the preemption, the*), that none exists.
The court adjourned to the afternoon.

ADDRESS
Of the Merchants of the town of Port-au-Prince* to
the National Civil ComntiJJioners, on board the
America, a French 74 gun'fkip in the road of
Pvt-au-Prince, dated the 8M of April, 1793 â
[tour days hejore the severe cannonade took place,
of which the particular i have appeared in former
papers.]
AS long as we had any hopes remaiuing
that an accommodation would prevent
the misfortunes that are ready to bur ft upon
Port-au-Prince, we did not think it our duty
to trouble you in relation to the private con
cerns of our commerce. At pre lent every
thing reminds us that we have every thing to
fear ; we? Ihould be blame-worthy then if we
did not exert ourselves, in the name of that
national commerce whole conf:dence we pos
sess, to make such representations as will
serve to the advancement of its intercil.
\Ve (hall not here undertake the defence of
an unfortunate town, now for three years pafl
the viftiin of perfidious condndt: we will beg
leave to observe, however, that it is painful
for its inhabitants to be accused of cl imes
without being fw3er<?d to exculpate them
selves ; to fee themselves menaced with pu
nifhinent without being informed what crimes
are laid to their charge. Will the delegates
of the nation condemn them without a hear
ing ; will they indifcriniinatelv involve in
their profciiption the friends of lawful go
vernment, the faithful children of the parent
country, and those who are accused of being
declared enemies of both ?âNo ; it is impos
sible the breajts of the comm.flioners can har
bor so cruel a thought. But, citizens com
miifioners, if we fhoitld for a moment flatter
ourselves with a ray of hope, how can we
otherwise then despair when we refledt that
by your proclamation of the 21ft of Jaft March
you involved us all in an indiscriminate fen
tertce of fufpic on, and held as certain truths
t-he slanderous affertidns of our enemies, car
rying despair into every heart b> your threats
of a deplorable transportation of the mer
chants of Port-au-Piince from their homes
and properties. What citizen would not
tremble, however intiocent he might be, to
fee his name on the lilt of the prolcribed; to
b* fsp* ated from bis wife, his children, his
property 9 from those various great and lacred
concerns which are entrusted to him, and to
be dragged like a criminal to the terrible tri
bunal of the National Convention of France !
In our hands remain the fortunes, and per
haps the last resources of those valuable men,
to whom the republic of France owes its
prosperity. In defending their interests, we
defend those of the mother country, who will
find in their generous and inexhaustible pa
triotism the means of refitting the enemies cf
liberty ; and yet, for fifteen days pad ail our
business is suspended. An embargo has been
put upon our drogumg veflTels, that keep up a
commercial connexion with a'd parts of tte

engagements we have made ; how flip ply the
dertiands of our correfpondt nts in Europe, if
all our abilities are thus fetureti ?
The armament In our harbor wears a me
nacing aspect, arjd the land fortes collected
from the wellerji quarter, are brought hither
to annihilate the last hopes of national com
merce infteatl of aiding the citizens of Port
au-Prince and Croix des Bouquets to fuppoi t
them. At this instant the revolters are waft
ing and burning the rich poflefHons in Cul de.
Sac; inflead of hallening to deft toy the vil
lains, you arm againlt a town that is atfually
at war with them, and which begs you for
peace. You refufe all intercourse with us,
rejert the deputations we have sent to yon,
and ftiew every hostile disposition. Alas ! do
you perceive how much future mifchieHs the
confeqtience of fitch steps. Do you knew that
we have on Ihore here our papers and preci
ous effects, and merchandize the vaiuÂ« of
which.is inestimable? that Heither these pa
pers nor these articles of merchandize are ouf
own, but that we are merely the trustees of
the greater part ? that rheir deftrti&ion would
occasion nutnberlefs failures, which failuies
would bring on the ruin of national commerce,
already (hocked by the misfortunes it lias
ftiftained ; and, finally do yon know. MelTis.
Commiflloners, that you will be refpoi fible for
these loÃes, and that fix millions of nffln tu
nate people, who are filpported by commerce,
will with cries of despair demand vengeance
on the National Convention.
Can it he your intention to set at defiant#
this awful refpnnlibility, and thereby reduce
us to defpaii } we Can no longer doubt it,
since the orders you have given to the Cap
tains of the merchant vefiels to anchor out
side of .the ships of war. What can be your
designs ? will you proceed to the last extre
mities against a town whole petitions "you
have refilled to heat i we now declare to vott
in form that the order you have given to the
mercantile Captains cannot be executed
without eflentially injuring the concerns of
trade. Indeed, only call your eyes on the
lituation of the vetTels in the road, few of
them are loaded or even ballasted j it would
be next to impolfible that they can go out of
the harbor, or be conducted into the groutyi
without being exrofed to confiderabie (ja
ma ge, and probably to a total loss. Bifidesj
moll of the Captains have their cargoes on
fliore, which they are obliged to ar'd care
fully : and how can they attimi so this dlity.
if you order them away to the grand road s at
so confiderabie a diftanee from their property.
Will you aofwer for it, that on your attack
ing the town the commercial magazines will
be refpefted ; and would you not be held re
sponsible for the lotfes that might happen
through plunder or conflagration >
It is impoflible to calculate the evils at
tendant upon civil war; and not one of t : -enj
but is a mortal stab to the interests of trade,
Citizen commiflioners, before you procced to
extremities, reflect that peace is for the ad
vantage of this colony, an.l that Fiance stands
in need of her commerce, and that you your
lelves will be held seriously lefpon/ible fur thq
loss of either. What is the meaning of that
general embargo laid solely on this port
which puts a stop to all our business and octa
fions immenle lofles to commerce. What
means that obstinate (ilence you keep not
withstanding our prefllng and repeated Ibfici
tations to you to explain yourselves What
mean tlio e threatening fleps are taking
against a town on whose fate a very largÂ£
(hare of the national commerce depends ?â!.
Inline, what conftruftion are we to put upon
the orders you have given to the Captains of
the trading veflels to retire outside of the
fliips of war 'âIs it really your design to can
nonade the town, and to deftrny in one in
stant the merchandize and debts due to the
national trade; for such will be the conse
quence of the least ast of hoftilityon our part".
We repeat to you, is it a time wheo tI,S
revolters lay waste and burn the rich po(i
feifions on the plain, when they are ruining
the sources of national commerce, that you
think it your duty to exci'e a civil war in
western province by arming fourteen pari/h
----cs against one. Is it not rather your duty to
destroy the revolters before you think of re
eftabliftting order in a p ace where ail is qui.
etâand do yoa suppose you will not have to
answer tor the conflagrations and devasta
tions whicharedaily committing in the plains,
for want of the stipulated relief, which your
proclamation has prevented the neighboring
pari/hes from fending.
Citizen comniiflioners, we nowdcclaÂ»e to
you that this address is to be printed and fq
be transmitted to all the commercial settle
ments of the republic, that we transfer to
yourselves all the reTponObility we Jay under
to our constituents, and that we will notify
to them, that if they fufler lofles, we have

PARIS, April S.
Yesterday five determined pcrfons
went our of Paris, who had sworn
to arrelt Dumourier or to kill him.
General Cuftine writes, that lie'
has been betrayed by Gen. Newin
ger ; that by treachory and the
cowardice of part the army, he
has loft a rlecifive battle on the Ana.
Gen. Newinger is gone to the ?ne
my, who have fcized the gieaier
part of the artiilery. Gen, Cuiline
has left a at Mayenne, and
has retired to Landau. What ad-ds
to these new misfortunes is, thatthe
army of Vofges has been abandoned
by that of Moselle.

; It is Hated in a Jacobin paper of "this
morning,that the French executive coun
cil i haw given orders to evacuate Savoy.
H'lvtr this intelligence has come, is not
(luted, but it certainly is not improbable,
as the-French would find it difficult lon
ger to maintain their usurped tyranny o
yei- that unhappy country. Why this
circuinlijuice fliould lead to a fepaiate
peace with England, we are at a loss to
jdivine. 1
Minifteis yefteiday received letters
from France, by the way of Dieppe and
Brighthelmlione, stating that on Friday
last, the 26th inftj. the Girortd'e party
had gained a complete triumph over the
Jacobine faction, and that Danton, Ro
befpi'erre, Marat, and many other# had
been maffa'cred, that they had appointed
.aâaew executive council, and that they,
were in fuH possession of the government.
This news Mr. Pitt lead to the commit
tee aflembled for cbnhdering of the
means of atMing the disordered credit of
the country ; and lord Grenville mention
ed it in the house of Lords ; but neither
of them declared that it came to their
hands upon authority that they could im
plicitly rely.
It is'fad that the leading members of
the executive council of Fiance are well
disposed to offer tenns of peace to this
couqtty almost on any conditions. In all
the debates in the national convention,
the members seem to be particularly
guarded in their expieiTi ms concerning
this countiy ; anc! it is well known M. de
â¢ Chauvelin has been very ungraciously re
ceived in France from the opinion entei
â¢ tained that he was too impetuous in his
: behaviour towards qur court, by which
! he precipitated his country into a wai. It
i is further said, that the committee of ge
[ neral defence in Paris was reduced from
25 to 9, ir. oi(Jcr to conduit the public
aiF.iirs ill general,ami a ueaociaiion
with this country in particular, with
("ecrecy.

Having learnt thatfufpicions have been

me and Phillip d'Orleans, a French Prince,
too well known under the name of Egalite,
and being anxious to preserve that ejleem of
which I daily receive the mojl honourable
teflimonies, I tale the ear'liejl opportunity oj

daily exijls an Orlean faP.iun ; that I never
had any connexion with the Prince who is
supposed to bt at the head of it, or who is the

all known laws, by criminally voting for the
Death of the unfortunate Louis XVI. againjl
whom he declared his opinion with atrocious
impudence, my contempt for him has been

With regard to his children, 1 think they

In conleqitence of the late failures in England

sixty thoufani men, women and children, for

Scotland, have been.difmtfTed and are in great

Gent ral Cuftine has written a letter to .the

speedily expeded.
The widow Capet was {till confined in the

nothing sanguinary appears to threaten them.
The Spanish Regjfter fliip, which was cap

a id recaptured by the British frigate Phaeton,
had on board 65 tons of gold and silver; and
goods to the amount of 830,3501. sterling â
She is fa d to be as rich a prize as the Aca
pulco, captured by Lord Anfon. The British,
however, by law, are entitled only to salvage,
about one half. Another Spanish ship recap
tured by the British, had 36000 dollars, be
sides gold, on board.
It may be collected from the late accounts of
French affairs, that they Hill hold a good face
towards the combined powers. In the various
small actions which have taken place on the
frontiers of France, the Auftrians and Prufliaus
appear to have aft< d on the defenftve, the French
being the afTailinis. The sortie from Caff. II is
reprcfented as confiding of 12,000 men, which
pla:nlv (hews that the French armies arc formi
dable in numbers ; as to Dum"nriri, it is diffi
cult to afcrr tain hii exafl litua, tonâit is pretty
certain however that he has no army or bocfv of
men with himânor <i it probable that he will
be entrusted with any command in the Auftiian
or PrufTnn armies. Siiould the account turn
out to be well founded that the moderate party
have attained a permanent afctndency iir the
National Convention, there is every- thing to
hope in relation to an eventual ctU"!ifkmrni of
the Liberties of Frame, on the bafts of a jit.4
and equal gnveinineni; confillency and liability,
jufl'i e and moderation in the public Councils
will produce nmverfal confidence and deflroy

The nation will ast unitedly âarid their mea
sures proceeding front a centre of Unionâthey
will lie invincible. It appears by some late de
crees that the Convention is retracing certain
Heps formerly laken which have doubtltfs had
an inaufpictous afpedt on their affairs-âparticu
larly that of interfering in the governments ot
other countries. There appears to be two prin

DUEJÂ® between the Duke of YORK and

A gentleman in New-York has received a
letter from his friend in Bristol, via Boston,
dated April 30th, in which he mentions, that
44 The St adt holder ilTued an order tor no
troops, either Dutch or Englilh, to be absent
from garrisons or encampments âwhich the
Duke of York took umbrage at, faying, none
but a Briton should command a Briton, and
spoke in such language as could not be brook'd
bv the Stadtholder's son, Prince Frederick of
Orange ; a duel was the confeaueuce, in which
the Dutchman was fevere'y wounded."
Er.traft of a letter-dated Edinburgh, 16th April
" ' .1 a;.. . 1/ r
1 793' a Gentleman in New-York,
il The country banks in England are ex
ceedingly numerousâThere has been a very
general devaluation among themâabove fe
vjentpof them have flopped payment; and
many bankers and great merchants in Lon
cfon.ââ Never zvat there such a general bankruptcy
in Ehgtand : And it seems not to be ended yet.
The bankruptcies amount already f rom 15 to
3Pn)Â«sOT}s sterling ; To you ma) judge of the
fituayon of England. Scotland, I am glad
to lay, has tele voiy little of the shock yet,
and I hope will elcape with what /he hath al
ready' fu fie red, which is not worth mention
ing when compared with England. The
caule of the m Vine life stoppages in London,
is owjng to the great <all of the funds of
stocks, which fell from 96 to 71 ; but are now
as high as again. The London bankers,
the Country banks of England and the great
merchants in London, were often full ot mo
ney ; and as ho interest is given for money in
England, they were always uTed to throw it
into the funds wherefore these three years
paik they never bought in, but were aSle to
fell ft-hf with the advantage of 1 or 2 per
cerft. advance when they needed it, and had
the chance of getting a half year's dividend if
it became due in the interim. A!l Europe will
feel the fhock-.âBills to the amount of 4 mil
lions fteriing, having been returned protested,
including those returned to America; and
money inuft be scarce abroad as well as in
Britain ; for owing to the p.refent war with
France, ail the K ngs of Europe aie nego
tiating loans. Goods however in Britain have
not faHen much, owing to the great bounties
. giv&n to feajnen and soldiers: No less than
122 thousand men ha.e been raised, including
â¢ the militia, for Tea and service, fmce the
firft of February last.
u A petition has been presented to Parlia
ment by fmnfc American Merchants again ft
that part of the Treason Bill which fubje&s
to death, for ordering corn, grain, &c." that
comes in America and touches in Britain, for
orders to be lent to Ff'anc?, but their peti

Extrafl from an exhortation-10 the DtreifofJ of the
Bank of Pennf'hania, which appeared in Mr.

i% Especial attention muff he paid rilfo to
the business carried on by tho'e you deal wit!:,
or whole notes you discount. All jobbirip; in
lands or stocks, as it will very little aliment
you: bank, and is belides of a very precarious
nature, fliould be touched as gently and a"!
cautiously as pollible. The real exporter of
youf p.-odiice, who pays the farmer bis re
wardâthe navigator and ship's hunfband,
who bring their treasures from the deepâthe
whole fa le and retail trader, who fnpply the
community with its supplies of cloarhing and
of foodâthe mechanic and manufacturer ;
these merit your chief attention ; the article l ?
they deal in, fliips, wheat, flour, sugar, dry
goods, &c. &rc. are of known value and solidi
tyâyou will rifle little in trusting them, and
if they have as may be expected, success,
they will greatly fe; vj you in their turn, by
rich and valuable deposits. While those who
deal in securities of left stable and certain va

The following cxtraSfrom *l*lt%ngiijh pafijr is
pubtiflua not with the remotejl idea ,if Hi appi,co
mity to arty persons in this country. '
" Indigent and worthless individual*; de
fining and desperate one 1 :, no doubt there
are among ft usâTt is the will of that Being
who difpoles of human affairs, that there
should he a portion of vice and depravity
mixed up in the trsufactions of mankind, and
from this we a-re not, no r can we be exempt.
That persons of the evil dafcription above
stated, are Ibme of them on the watch for,
and ready to take part in the word of crimes,
oifences against the state, is not to oe contro
verted. If pretence or means can be devised
to excite pubiic disorder, men thus wickedly
intenttoired are forward to kindle, inflame
and fpiead the mifchief. Nor is it to lie won
dered at; for during the prevalence thereof,
the malignity and baleneTs of their characters
find scope to aflâopportunities for the perpe
tration of crimes are multiplied, and the pro
babilities of detection or puniHiment leflehed
âTime*of sedition, tumults and ricits, are
consequently to tkem a harvest, with no pro
perty or reputation to facrifice, what have
they to lose in fuclftimes ? The spoils of plun
der, the pleasure of beholding calamity and
devastation, they may obtain.
4t It is curious to ob erve how men of this
fort come forth, and rear their heads when
they fufpeftclouds f the kird in quettion to
be gatheringâMark the then cbterfnlnefs of
their looks, the lightne's of their deoortment,
the audacity of their air and languageâwhilii
sober, upright and refpe&able citizens, who
wish well to their country, are grave, anxious
and troubled, they are gay and triumphant
with them all is life, spirit and motion.
" Reverie or dispel such appearance, they
droop again, hang their heads, are not seen or
heard of, and (ink into nothingâS'lent,dark,
dejerted are they, wrapt up in the hopes of)
and intent upon the project of brooding mif
chief."

that 1 might depend upon h:s alfiftance in my
unfortunate situation. 1 immediately (by
the advice of the principal merchants in this

ordered the ship to be fold at au&oii accord

pur chafed rhe Mary from the levenue of Ire

From the Impartial HkraiD-i new paper
lately ejlaklijked in JUtwbu ry-PottâMaJJachujetts.
r*tnft from Topographical Sketches of the
County of ESSEX-
PASSING over the river, we enter Ando.
ver, divided into two parishes. The ge
neral appearance of this place is thriving, and,
for an agricultural town, the buildings, pub-
Jic and private, are in a style of uncommon
neatness and elegance. The land is of an
excellent quality, and under handsome culti
vation ; particularly that part of it which is
watered by Shaw/keen river, a considerable
stream which takes its rife in Bedford in the
couoty of Middlesex, and, pafling through
Billerica, Tewkfbury and Andover, dischar
ges itfelf into Merrimack river, at this latter
place. In the south parish are a powder-mill
and paper-mill. From tP.e former of these,
large supplies were fumifhed to the army,
during the late war. The paper-mill is yet
in its infancy, but has already exhibited spe
cimens of its manufacture of an excellent fa
bric. T! efe are both owned by the Hon.
Mr. Phillips, President of the Senate, a na
tive inhabitant of this town, wliofe unwearied
attention to the political, manufa&ural and
literary interests of his country are too well
known to need an encomium here, and have
endeared his name to the citizens of the Com
monwealth in general, aud especially to those
o the County of Elfex. Under his auspices,
aid by the liberal benefactions of his father,
tie late Hon. Samuel Phillips, of Andover,
and of the Hon. John Phillips, L L. D. of
Exeter, in the State of New Hampshire, an
academy was instituted in this town, in the
year 1778, and in the year 1780 an a<ft palled
the Legislature, incorporating the gentle
men above named, with sundry other refpeft
able characters, by the name of u The Truf-
of Phillips's Academy in Andover/'*
The appointments of this teminary are li
beral. A preceptor, an afliftant preceptor,
and a teacher of writing and practical mathe
matics, aie at present well fuppoi ted, and
the funds are said to be in a, growing state.
Witliiu its original defignfome higher branches
of learning may be taught as ability and op
portunity IHall arise.
* This name diflinguipies this inflitution from a
Jimi/ar one in New-Hawpfhirc, tailed "Phillips's
Exeter Academy,* founded Jolely by the Hon. Doctor
Phillips, the fund> of which are /aid to exceed
ten thou fund pounds currency.âhi addition to tkcfe
foundations, this gentleman has been hy far the tnofl
munificent benefnÃoi to Dartmouth Uhivcfjily. Such
hi ft and pious diflributions of ptoperty in the life
time of the pojjcjfor are tl,e mofl honorable dfplay of
genuine pubiic J pint and dijint'erejled patriotism ;
and the man who thus nobly triumph s over the Jordid
didatcs oj avarice or a mijlaken flf-inttiejl-, has
fu/e!\ a better title to be canonized, than a whole
hofl of legendary J amis and martyrs.
