Primary Ajfemblics.
In the primary aflemblies, every man
aged 21 years has a right to vote, provided
that his name is inscribed on the civic table,
and that he lhall have resided one year in
France.

ted in each department, that none lhall con
fid of less than 400, or 11, ore than 900
members j in each of the re a feleft commit
tee is to be chosen by ballot, consisting of as
many members as there are fifties of citizen?
in the aflembly.
In this committee, he who has the majori
ty of votes (hall be president of the aflembly ;
the three next 011 the lift (hall be secretaries.
The duty of the l'eleft committee is to keep
the records, and to arrange and submit the
business to the aflembly.
All ele&ions are to be carried on in those
aflemblies. The intermediate, or e e&otal
aiFemblier,, have no place in this code, The
ele&ions are to be made by what is called a
double scrutiny ; each gives in a signed lift
of candidates equal to the number of places
to be filled. These bulletins, or lifts of pre
sentation, as they are termed, are Cent to
the administration of each department.â
They feleft a triple number of those candi
dates who have most votes, and from those
font back to the primary aflemblies; a defi
nitive ele&ion is made, each citizen giving in
as before a lift of the candidates to whom he
gives his preference.
In the deliberations of these aflemblies, the
fame mode is to be followed as in the elec
tions. The question is to be (haped so as to
be answered by a simple negative or affirma
tive. Oil the day appointed for the decision,
each citizen gives in a faillrtin, or flip of paper,
inscribed with his name, and the word yet or
no. These are to be transmitted from the
d'ftrift to the department, where the general
result is to be ascertained.

Letter from tlie Mmitler at War.
Paris, March 5.
" I think it my duty to inform
you, that 1 learn by a letter whjch
1 have received from Gen. Valence,
that the Pruflians, to the number of
2 J or 30,000 men, have advanced to
the Roer to relieve Maeftficlit, an J
that the movement of the enemy
has induced Gen. Miranda to sus
pend the bombardment of the place.
I his event, of little importance iij
it fell, may only oblige 11s to attack
it in form, and retard us sometime
longer. Such is the piecife truth
of intelligence, which may be con
sidered as of more importance than
ic deserves, and on which it is my
duty to fix the opinion of the Nati
onal Convention."
Paris is now in the mod profound
tranquility. The plans of the in
fmgents, or more properly of their
inltigators, are coinpleatly defeat
ed, at least for the present. The
examination now rigorously going
on, will probably bring Ibme of the
latter to piuiifhment.

T hole who speak so coolly of the

vent the entrance of an enemy by

reason in much the fame way as the

throat in jail.
It is (aid, as a proof of the popu
laiity of the war, that 1500.recruits
were railed last week in Manchef

that the war has already suspended
the looms of Manchelter.
i he great houle which Hopped a

The French made an attack, in
which they were much annoyed by
the fire of the Englifli frigate.
This, as it was unexpected, Do

the French were killed by the fitÂ®

Hague, March 4. An account
has been received of a complete vic

Venlo, by Prince Frederick of
Brunfvrick. The circumltances of
this action are not yet accurately
detailed; but it is laid that IJOO
Frenchmen are taken pri (oners,
with 22 pieces of cannon.
The siege of Maeilricht is raised.
The tide of the affairs of France
begins to change. The immense
force of the empire begins to get iu
motion, and its weight will be found
irrefiftable.
Dnmourier has withdrawn bim
fell'from before Williamftadc ; it is
conjectured, fn consequence of tlie
news of 2 iucb iignal defeats as his
colleagues have experienced- Me
has retired to the diflrance of a
league from that fortrefs. If he is
not expeditious in retreating out of
the Dutch territory.it is more than
probable that his retreat will be en
tw-eJy for the vi<ftoriousarr
hiies of Clairfair, & tlie two princes
above named, will pour in upon him
and surround him.
The effect this intelligence has
had in Holland, is inconceivable.â
The people befoi'6 were calmly de

that the Duke of Brunfwick had had

that Gen. Beaolieu was marching

" The example of France (fays a writer in

siders all government as injurious ; this is but
an old objection of the enemies of public tran
quility, new vamped. Thee are persons in
she world to whom a// government is intoler
able.
The provision for paying S'le interest of the
public debt has long been a grievance to per
sons of a certain description, becanfe the dif
charging our obligations, involved the necef
fity.of tr.xes and revenue; but thefeconfident
poljficiaijs now take it in dudgeon, that the
government will not involve the people in in
calculable expence, by plunging them in an
-troÂ«*ceffary war !
<, It i* too apparent, that the enemies of the
public credit of thi-. country, despairing 0 f
fuqeefs in their machinations to overthrow
the funding fyfiem, are now attempting to
implicate the United States in the war 'aging
between France and the combined powers,
doubtless expeÂ£ting in that event to be favor
ed with an opportunity of executing their fa
vorite plan by rendering the public burthens
requisite for both objects, infupportable.âlt
is impoflibie that the people should not jujlly
appreciate such politics.
The oldCongrefs had the hardiness to stamp
on, their paper money this injunction, mind
your bujinefs; how well this applies to our vo
lunteer ftatefmcn, it is not difficult to shew ;
but, modern politics enntradift the old faying
that what is every body's business," is nobody's
bnfinefs.
When success crowns our enterprizes it is
indicative of their having been planned in
wisdom. The men who have been the prin
cipal agents in conducing the affairs of this
count'/to a situation far more eligible and
prÂ«fpero*rt than any ageor nstiotrever before
experienced, are, through the favor of Pro
vidence at the Helm at this critical juncture
in t>;e concerns of Europe. Let experience
teatfh us wisdom, and inspire the people with
confidence in those who have so long ei joyed
their their approbation. If thole who have
done worthily for their countiy are rewarded

The Scotch, however, are not so unanimous
upon this occafinn, as they were then : a
great number in Scotland being ujjainft the

that two thirds of the people, in their prefeut
discontented State of mind, are completely
adverse to the present fvftem of English poli
tics. As to the French themfelvr'., if they
were unanimous at home, they might be a
match ferall t ieir enemies. Twq of their
General?:, Doinourier and Cuftine, are men
ot wonderful fortune and ability : But the
queltionable execution of rhcir King, which
has estranged many moderate men from their

concluded or excited by the execrable fa<stion
of Kohei.'pierre Â£r Marat,have caused a doubt
at least a fear, that the really virtuous men
among them, are too few and too weak to
carry their upright intentions into effect. In
the mean time, the government of Ireland is
carrying on a high and flrong band in cou
janftion with the Englilh minlfterâA man
dare not speak, or fearcelv think, tor fear of
the Secret Committee of the Lordi, who have re

WHEREAS it appears, that a state of
war exifti between Auflria, Prullia,
Sardinia, G. Britain, and the UnÂ»ted Nether

ligerent powers.
I HAVE therefore thought fit by these
presents, to declare the disposition of the
United States to observe the conduit afore
faid towards thoi'e powers refpeftively; and
to exhort and warn the citizens ofthe United

iugs whatsoever, which may In any manner
tend to contravene such disposition.
AND I DO hereby alio make known, that
whosoever of the citizens of the United States
/ball render himfelf liable to punishment or
forfeiture under the law of nations, by com
mitting, aiding or abetting hostilities against
any of the said powers, or by carrying to any
of them those articles, which are deemed con
traband by the modern usage of nations, will
not receive the protection of the United
States against such punishment or forfeiture ;
and further, that I have given inftru<stions to
those officers, to whom it belongs, to cause
prosecutions to be instituted against all per
sons, who (hall, within the cognizance of the
Courts of the United States, violate the law
of nations, with refpe<Jt to the powers at
war, or any of them.
IN TESTIMONY whereof, I have cau

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE Author is sensible that the firft edition
of his American Geography (which makes Part
I. of the above work) was in many instances dc
fe&ive, in others erroneous, and in
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was hi*
desire, in the present edition, to fupplv the defi
ciencies, correal the errors, and meliorate the
offenfivc parts of the last. To aflift him in this
business, he has received many valuable commu
nications from the heads of departments in the
general government, and from gentlemen of re
fpe&ability in the several ftatce. The descrip
tion of foreign countries (which composes Part
11. of the above work) has been carefully com
piled from the most approved writers on Geo- Â«
graphy, and ufeful information introduced from
the discoveries of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and refpeÂ£table authors. Indeed, no pains
nor expenfc have been (pared to render this work
the moll complete, accurate, and ufeful of any
ever offered to the public.
