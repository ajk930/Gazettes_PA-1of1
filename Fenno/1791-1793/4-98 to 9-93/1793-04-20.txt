For the GAZETTE of the UNITED STATES.
Mr. Pen no,
I H AVE just received and read your paper of
Wednesday, and am very happy to find that
lo large a majority of the late Congress, have
pronounced i.bc official conduit of-the Secretary
of the TrCafury, to be clear of blame. Feeling
it to be not only a privilege, but an important
duty, for citizen# to comrmmicate to each other
their fentimcnts on public men and meafiires, I
shall take-the liberty of stating to yod some re
flexions on what has recently taken place at the
feat of government.
It ill robe hoped that there is a good intention
with many, in the ftriflures which have been
made on the Secretary's conduct, and in rhe op
pofitipn to those measures which are said to be
indebted to him chitfly for their exigence.â
Whatever may be the furmifesof unsound f/rin
ciples and corrupt morals in some who are en
gaged in this oppofiiionâin others, f am for
myfelf fatisfied there is the purest virtue; and
tiro' I tremble at their political principles as
endangering the happiness of my country, vet I
revere the motives by which they are prompted
to opppfe. Indeed I have been grieved that bad
design has been indiscriminately attributed to
all who have condemned tbofe federal measures,
which, to such as think like myfelf on thefefub-
j ests, appear efTential to the dignity, honor and'
prosperity of out land. The asperity too, with
which those have been treated, who may justly
be fufpefted of political hypocrisyâos usurping,
and alas! of having the name of patriots, while
they know nol thf elevated temper and delicious
fenlations of patriotism, was no small impru
dAice. These charaftcis have, by this means,
been too highly irritated ; their evil disposi
tions, but the wore inflamed, and, like air once
fixed now rendered vigorous by heat, have burnt
with violence, and have found vent in the most
iinjuflifiahle condemnation of the proceedings of
and in groundlefi, aspersions of the
mofl valuable fervan's of the publie. While it
is right, yea an incumbent duty which we owe
to ourfclves and our dear posterity, to stem the
torrent Of antifedcral opposition, let us do it
with thcjd.ignity, coolness and candour, which
belong to truih and ensure success. In taking
up my pen, I would fain excite no one painful
sensation in the bread of any citizen of the Uni
ted States. Unless it were absolutely neceflary,
I woukL not even call up that indignation we ail
feel against hypocritical profeflions of the amor
patriae, and the deadly projefi* of party and
ptrfonal profit. If it could be done, I would
cool the minds of allâl cleanfe;the foul

Who can examine rhe official charaÂ£ler of the
Secretary of the Treasury, obfrrve his indefatiga
ble industry in the service of his country, the
order, accuracy and perfettion in whicbhe per
forms the weighty bufincfs of his depftttmQnjt,
without cordial approbation ? Can any one djf
cern the least back wardnefs or delay in exposing
to the view of the public all his financial pro

been the utmost. promptitude of obediencejto the
rcquifitions of CÂ»Â»ngrefs, direlied so this pojnt ?
Tho' by tfre Conftiturron, f* a regular ftneincm
and a coimt qftb? receipt? and expenditures df
atf public money, shall be publiAv d, from time
to time \et is it not the duty of Congre'fs firft
to give direction for the drawing up and pu.b
lifhing of this ftatrment and account? This ar
ticle is fnund in the midst of the pf> weir's gUeh
to, and the rrftrxftton* laid on Goiigtefs. It :s
therefore, in faÂ£l, a part of the general duly
sketched out to Congi fsin the Conftituupu.
reducing this and oiher conflitutional principles
to pra6Vice. ihe SeCtetiry is only as thÂ£ instru
ment in the workman's hand. As the work
man must will and mov;, before the inllr um r.|t
cau execute any thing, so, if this article is to
complied with in all its spirit, arid in .its furtheft
extent, to Cdngrefs'it belongs to will the com
pliance. Then, and riot till then, is the Secre
tary to be blamed, when he is deficient irv com
plying with Congtelliona! injitnQions. Thi â¢, J
believe, he never has been. In every iuftance
within my knowledge, he has done all which
Cdngrefs has enjoined. Here then let me afit,
was it kind to impute, not in a private convcr
fation* but on the floor of Congress, that i.Â«, in
the hearing of all A met icaand of all Europeâ
w'aS it kind to '.mpute a partial ftatemcnt of rc
ceipts and expenditures, when rib more hid been
required by Congress, to Â»o infamous defrgn of
defrauding the public ?* Was it not irrjiptu<tcf ( t
at the leaft r upon so flight, and as we have now
seen, upon no foundation* to proclaim to all the
world that corruption wa< already preying upon
the vitals of oor coun'ry? Are not for wardnefs
and ralbuefs the lowcft charges which we must
brin</ against luch as have spread an alarm in the
land, from mifcor.ceptions of the Secretary's re
ports, from a fuperficia! understanding of the
fuhjc&s of" which they treat, and, tho* lawgivers,
from an, aÂ£hia! ignorance of, or as fcandalons
inattention to, the nature of the laws? WelJ
might th.r Seer. fÂ»ry fay, Â«â¢ I forbear to attempt
to trace the fouice ot a raiftakc so extraordinary. **
Indeed* in my opinion, he has tl fliown,'arvdi
that in a confpicuons manner, fallacies enough
in the statement, from which the inference of
an unaccounted forbafance was drawn, to evince
that it is one ti/fue of error.* 1
I do not fay there was malic*, and a delibe
rate wicked design in.the mover of the laÂ«e in
vestigations : this is very far from me, ar\d $
heartily disapprove os-such insinuations without
full proof. Our thwarted in wh.it we
suppose neccffairy to t)ie public good, Ihould not
make us call our opuofers scoundrels. This is
very wrong. Yet I must confefs. some things
force us to hatd thoughts ; and the proposal to
defer thr omiftd. ration of certain resolutions to
the next Congress. so fhockcd me, as almotl
made my ftrugglm;/ good hopes of some antife*
deral patriots, givoup she ghost.
On the whole, I am free in obftrving that
there was evident ignorance and ralhnefs in the
accufatioos so publicly made against the Secre
tary of the Treasury ; and I was most hcartilyr
rejoiced to fee the relultâ*in his coming forth
from the furnace, as gold, more valuable and,
more blight in the public estimation.
I was rejoiced, because Congress have solemn
ly averred to the whole Union, that the appre
hended corruption is not to be found.
it not be a grievous calamity, an awful presage
of the ruin of our country, if so soon, the pure
region we live in had produced monsters to de
vour the land, to ercft the deftru&ivc banners of
aristocracy, and gather around them all that host
of citizens who now relv on the justice and ho
nour of government ? When no such monsters.
are found, when cxiftcnce is given to them only
by the exceflive jealousy of a too highly fer
mented patriotism in some, and by bafenef* ir\
othersâevery friend to his country must hear*
lily rejoice.
I rrjoiee moreover to -fee so lÂ«rgc a portion of

* And when the Secretary feemei difpofedfpon
aneovjly to ad up to the spirit of the aforemen
tioned article of the Conflitution âwhen he did more
towards it, in his reports to the House, than Congrtfs

It is easy for an occafioÂ»>al refi

of the Republic, who, without -any
provocation from the government
or from individuals, Without any
' ground of jealoufyor apprehension,
and contrary to what that enemy
has declared, and preached, and
sworn, is now-menacing its very vi

peace and good-will to tn?n, bring

Letters are just received here to

has taken poUeffion oftliat garrif'on

was dtfencelefs, and is only a few

the lame river. The lame intelli

Prultians, and will immediately let

The natural defence of Holland

precautions are taken on the rivers
and the different Itrairs in Zealand.

quished, and England alone has de-
Icribed the true place in which it
was vulnerable. War mull be de
clared against the alfignats : those
aflignats with which the patriots
have hitherto bought corn, iron,
gold, and the secrets of their ene
mies, & with which they would buy
their enemies themselves ; it from
one extremity of Europe to the o
ther, they were totally proscribed,
if all communication was intercept
ed from Archangel to Malta, the
Republic would have neither a sack
of corn, nor a horse, nor an ox, nor
a cannon ball, and certainly before
the expiration of fix months, the
three millions of armed Republi

and murmurs, would fall at the teet
of the coalesced powers, and give
up their arms for a morsel of bread.
LIVERPOOL, Feb. 16
A curious effigy of Paine the li
beller, was prepared at Wigan, on
Monday 1 alt, and lodged in the pri
son under a gU:ird of two armed
men. On Tuesday morning he was
brought out in a cart, attended by
a mock clerical/and taken to Scholes,
where the belt post he meritted was
ready to receive him. He was tucked
up for about two hours, afterwhich
he was taken down and thrown in
to a fire, prepared for the purpose.
The procession was attended by
Capt. Stanley, and his new raised
coil)pany of volunteersâwho joined
the populace in shewing their con
tempt for a cliaraiSerfo highly wor
thy the detestation the people of
this kingdom have so generally

The above circumstance will be a
severe shock to the tender feelings
of a brother editor in another coun
try, whose powers offenfibility have
been so frequently wounded on fi
milaroccafions. We mean the man,
who ridicules the idea of f'orrow for
the death of the French kingâyet
almost breaks his heart with grief
and indignation at the mere report
of his dear Paine being hung in ef

For some time it has been the fa
fhion with our Liverpool ladies, to
wear poppy coloured or dark red
ribbands. But let them consider
that the female savages of France,
at this time wear the fame colour,
and call it the blood of Louis. Then
in abhorrence of French barbarity,
let our Englilh ladies throw off with
contempt thofo colours which are
worn to distinguish the enemies of
royalty and the levers of human
blood.

N E \V-Y O R. K, April 15.
Yeftcrday arrived from Calcutta, after a
passage of four months and 15 {lays, the (hip
America, Captain Bright.
By this arrival we have received accounts,
that Tippoo Saib has so far complied with
the requisitions of the treaty, as to pay two
pagodas of the three which he was to pay to
the Englifli. Tippoo's two sons are still re
maining at Calcutta,
It appears that the success of the English
against Tippoo, was principally attributed to
the bravery of some Americans (about 6o in
number) who were officers in the army of
Lord Cornwall*!!. These Americans were ta
ken during the late war in America, sent o
ver to London as prisoners, and from thence
sent to the East-Indies as private soldiers ;
where, by their good conduct they were pro
moted.
It was supposed in India when the Ameri
ca came away, that Tippoo certainly would
make another attempt or* the Englifti the firft
favorable opportunity. This restless ambi
tious man, appears far from being fatisfied
with the late.treaty, and if the French were
to think of an attack upon the Englilh settle
ments in India, Tippoo would be a powerful
friend to them, and might be fatal to the
Engiifh.
A number of American reffels had failed
for Oftend, laden with sugar, when the Arni
ca came away.
The America's cargo consists almost entire

THOUGHTS ON THE
STATE OF AMERICAN INDIANS.
(Continued from No. gi, of this Gazette.)
No. IV.
ANOTHER cause of the consumption of
the Indians is the multiplication of wars.
The firft settlers were more attentive to
secure their establishment than to cultivate
the affections of the nativesâThe latter soon
perceived that the success of their new guests
was incompatible with their interests, and
deftruftive of their mode of life. Jealoftfy
quickly kindled hostilities, and excited a spi
rit of animosity between the two nationsâ
frequent encounters took place, in which the
discipline and arms of the whites gave them
a decided superiority, and wafted the strength
and impaired the numbers of the savages.â
Ignorant of the military art, and destitute of
the means of conducing war, they easily be
came a prey to their more policied and fkilful
neighbors.âlt is not neceifary to enumerate
the various engagements which have taken
place, the history of almost every state far
m/lies moie or less.âBut the hostilities be
tween their own tribes have been much more
frequent, and probably much more destruc
tive than their contests with the whites. The
occasions of war among them are numerous
and frequentâEncroachments on their hiHit
ing groundsâthe obstruCtion of those paths
through which custom and the tacit tonfent of
the neighboring tribes have given them a
right to passâa thtrft for revenge, the emu
lation of valor, and the intemperate ardor of
young warriors,impatient to try theirftreugth ?
are perpetual sources of discord among them*
The manner of conducting hostilities, the
conduct of the viCtors, and the national and
hereditary feuds which these ingender, are
unfailing sources of consumption, From their
infancy, they are taught to consider the cha
racter of a warrior as their highest gloryâand
the habits of their education are all calculated
to inspire them with courage, with Ikill, and
an ambition for diftinltion in war. The high
est praise of a warrior consists in destroying as
many of the enemy with as little loss to his
own party as potiible. After vi&ory, they
dispatch such as they are unable to remove
without difficultyâthe remainder they con
duit to their tribe, to be adopted into their
families, or to satiate their unrelenting ven
geance, by fuffering every torture their inge
ouity can invent or their cruelty infjiCt. in
371
cafe of pu: fult, they dispatch their prisoner-;,
to prevent their being released by their coun
trymen. Those of the captives who are pretty
far advanced in life, and have been fucCeKful
warriors, are always marked victims of their
vengeance. They have no idea of sparing
and exchanging prisoners Their national
antipathies are generally hereditary ; fathers
bequeath their animosity to their children,
and rhefe rivalfhips continue from age to age.
These contentions existed among the In- I
diuns indeed before the iettlement of the ,
country by the Europeansâbut they have j
multiplied and animated themâthey have
iurnifhed them with more deadly weapons of
de ft ru'&i oh, and whetted tbeir natural appc-
blood, by the allurement of an intoxi
eating feward. By diltra&ing their councils,
by preventing any concert in their measures,
and by nourifiling the natural enmity of the
tribes, they rendered them the initruments of
each other's deftru&ion.
The French and Engiifh also, whose in
trigues and ambition have kept this country
from its lirffc settlement embroiled in war,
availed theinfelves Â°f the credulity of the
natives, and made them the dupes of their
artifice ind a l'acrifice to their aggrandize
ment. The uqhappy influence of these wars
on population, needs no illulfration. They
constitute perhaps the most powerful cause of
the decay of the Indians.
The use of fprrituous liquors, in like man
ner, has hac( a fatal efficacy of the like nature.
All barbarous nations are found to be exces
sively fond of strong drink. Whether this
arises from their constitution, the poverty of
their food, or merely from the exceliive use
of it, I pretend not to determine âperhaps all
tfefe causes concur in producing this effect.
In experience we find, that whenever they
Can procure it in any abundance, they fcarce
lyVyer fail to become; the victims of their
temrrttl'. TTie' restraints it removesârite
pafilons which it inflamesâthe vices to which
it prompts, and the cliforders which it ci eates,
have the innft unhappy influence in weaken
ing their strength and in diminiftiing their
numbers. This cause, however, could have
a partial influence only, as the use of spirits
has never been general among them, and
could only be procured from the whites.
The small-pox also deserves a place in an
enumeration of the causes which have contri
buted to the consumption of the Indians â
This* has always carried deftru&ion and dis
may whenever it has been dilTeminated among
chemâ-few have lurvived this disorder. It is
uncertain whether this is to be ascribed to
their peculiar constitution or mode of life.â
Their manner of treating it is known to be
unlkilfu! and dangerous. Nor has the success
of in Â»cu)ation been such as we ftiould have
expected. It is evident therefore that the
diminution of the sources of fubfiftente, the
practice of war, the use of spirituous liquors,
anci jhe finall-po>{, have contributed to Jeflen
the number oflndiansâand inafrnuch as num
bed favour the improvement of society, to
the progress of Civilization among
effect we find that the Indians do
not'ihcreafeâthey do not indeed continue
stationaryâtheir marriages do not replace
the parents; the greater part of their chil
dren die in infancyâfome tribes arc wholly
extinct, others are considerably lelfened, and
the whole number of Indians is greatly dl
minifhed.

Experiment 11.
Do(storÃufli had requested me to make an
observation on the pujfation of the arteries,
when I should be arrived at my greateil
height. I found it impoflible to make use of
his quarter minute glais which he had provi
ded for that purpose, but I fupplitd its place
by an excellent second hand watch ; and the
result of my observations gave me 92 pulfa
tiorti in the minute, (the average of four ob
servations made at the place of my highelt
elevation) whereas, on the ground, I had ex
perienced no more than 84 in the fame time,
average of 4 observations, difference 8 pulsa
tions more at the height of 5812 English feet,
where I then was.
Experiment 111.
I had been requested by Doctor PJunket F.
Glentworth to make experiments in the ethe
rial regions with a load-stone, which he had
left me. On the gronnd it raifedsi-2 oz.
avoirdupois, but at the aforefaid height it
would hardly bear 4 oz-
Experiment IV.
The lowest of the mercury in the ba
rometer after having brought its furface in
its lower reservoir to its proper level, arid
corrected its dilatation, was 69 lines 9 16
French measure, or 74 lines 8 16 Englifti
measure, which according to Mariot, Boyle,
Deluc, and Father Cote, gives an elevation
of 905 toifer, I foot and 6 inches, (the toife is
6 feet) or 5431 feet 6 inohes Freneh measure,
and at the usual redu&ion 968 fathom 4 feet,
or 5812 Englifli measure. Th-s was the high
est elevation of my balloon, without having
thrown out any of my ballast, except the li
quor contained in the fix bottles given to me

COMMUNICATIONS.
While our complainers tell us what they
do not like, will they be pleased to tell us ex
plicitly what they would like. The best way
to judge is by comparison. We make no
doubt they are good hands to pull downâlet
us fee their talents as builders. From what
we havefeen, we are afraid they handle the
pick-ax better than the trowel. Any fool can
put a fire-brand to a temple.
We haye been told of the dangerous influ
ence of titles. To those who maintain that
founds are substances we recommend to keep
a drift watch left the enemies of liberty should
take advantage of some unguarded spot and
entrench thenifelves. It is ftrprifing that
the title of reverend applied to the clergy
(hould have remained uncenfured till lately.
But the high founding titles of the Grand
Lodges of the Free Masons, with ther Right
Worfhipful Grand Matters and their Most

lifhed or Liberty will not live to fee another

THE ci cievant Due d'Orleans,
was ever the avowed enemy
of the widowed queen ; not from
any real insult or injury he ever re
ceived from Iter, but because her
vivacity and wit fomeiinies led ber
to ridicule his follies and vices.
Some years since, when the duke
began to build upon the gaudens of
the palais royal, the inhabitants of
Paris, murmuring at his condudt in
depriving them of their favorite
walk, grew highly incensed againlt
him. The lovely queen, who had
heard of the difconieut among the
people, and who ever wiflied to con
tribute to their pleasure and liappi
liefs, f'aid jocosely to Monsieur d'Or
leans, " my cousin you will r.ot have
much trouble or expence in finding
materials for your new buildings ;
for i find all the inhabitants of Pa
ris are ready to throw ft ones at you."
This innocent pleasantry was how
ever one of the crimes never forgot
ten by the dnke, and never menti
oned but with a threat of vengeance.
The late unfortunate king of
France was not only the tenderefl
of fathers, hut the, mod conUaut of
hulbands ; of which the following
well known anecdote will bear wit
ness : About ten yeais since, che
wife of a Bourgeoife in Paris, re
markable for her beauty, made a
point of following the king to all
public places,even his morning rides
were attended by the ambitious Ena
morata. The king being infoimed
of her motive, one morning, while
taking his exercise in the Bois de
Bologne.nearPai is.ftopp'd hishorfe,
and addrefled the lady to'the sol*
lowing purport :â" If you follow
me from idle curioflty, madam, I
think by this time that curioflty
might be fatisfied ; if from a desire
to draw my attention, I will save
you the trouble ; for while my wife
is the firft object of my afFetfions,
I have no occasion for a mistress."
Such was the vidim of an inhuman
people, the firfl truly virtuous mo
narch that misguided France ever
had to boast of !

TO THE PUBLIC
â¢ THE Author is sensible that (he fi,ft edition
of his American Geogiaphy (which makes Part
J'"' thc abo " e wo 'k) was in many instances de
fective, in others erroneous, and in some offen
livc. It has been his endeavour, as it was his
desire, in the present edition, to fupplv the defi
c.encies, correct the evrors, and meliorate the
offenfive pans of the last. To aflift him in this
bulinefs, he has received many valuable commu
nications from Ihe heads of departments in the
Kncral soverament, and from gentlcfnen of re
fptclabiluy iri ihe fcveial Hates. The defcrip.
tnii of foreign countries (which composes Part
11. of the above work) hat been carefully com
piled from the most approved writers on Gro.
graphy, and ufetul information introduced from
the difcover.es of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and refpeitable authors. Indeed, no pains
norcxpenfe have been spared to render this work
the moll complete, accurate, and ufeful of anv
ever offtrtd to the public
