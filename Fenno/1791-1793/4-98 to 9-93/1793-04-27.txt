ed here iu February, with the most diftiij
gu jibed marks of honor and refpc/t. The
reports which have been spread in Europe
that the Porte was making preparations of
war againfl: Russia, are without -foundation.
The people in general detest France.
STOCKHOLM, Feb. i.
A war between this country and Russia haS
long keen deemed probable, it now appears
inevitable.
The tiding-; of the tragical end of his most
Christian Majesty, has filled every mind with

All the French are batiifted from SAkony.
The 1 atefl accounts from Constantinople
state, that the Porte gave to M. de Choifeul
Goufiier, the late French AmbafTador, a pre

It is confidently reported there, that the

March 4. âOh the 25th ult; Breda was far 1 -
rendered by treachery, withont having flood
a siege. The garrison, by terms of capitular
tion, marched out with all the honors of war,
and with full liberty to serve again. It was
surrendered in consequence of a confederacy
between Count Byland, the governor, and
some discontented magistrates and other in*
habitants, and much against the inclination
of the garrison. Count Byland is at the
Hague, under arrest, and a commission is or
dered for trying him.
Williamftadt, Klundert, Steenbevgen, Ge*

"Last Saturday, the 2gd ioft. about Viaif af
ter eight o'clock* a trumpeter, accompanied
by a French"officer, arrived bcfoie tie gates
of Bosch, and were conducted t Â» thr com
mandant, whom they Summoned in the rame

The commandant feftt an answer auolit i 2
o'clock, implying Â»' refute' , hoftihties com

i'rtnth threw fiÂ»:Ue bomb*Â» and howitzers into
the city >' the firft was so well directed, thiit
it icll before tbe guatd-houfe, and wounded
a grenadier. By tiie fabftquent bomb* feve
rul hoafes were damaged ; the alarm was
immediately bent, and the military took
their refpeetive stations. From that time
the bombardment became very violent, and
failed uniiiteri\ifÂ»tedly till feveu o'clock at
ui&hl, when all was still for some time.
Oil Sunday morqing, about Imlf pad three
o'clock, the French bombardment became
extremely violent, and was well answered by
the gaÂ» rifon. It laftcd till seven oVlock, and
during that time the French threw in 150
bombs and howitzers, which -Jemoliftied more
than sixty bouse .
The damage itill bi\ve become
greater, and could not pofftbly be repaired,
iince no perjton dorft appear in the dree ft to
catch the bombs and extinjttjifli tire fire, and
every inhabitant fought refuge in the cellar
of his houle.
On Sundav, towards noon, another fiaff
officer with a trumpeter, arrived before the
gate of Bofcli, and was again conducted to
the commandant, to fuwrnon the city again,
threatening to reduce the place to a(h<*Â», and
to'put tiie whole garrison to the IVord. Af
ter this, the firft council of war was held, and
towards night a Major with a trumpeter were
dispatched to the French General, who re
mained with the French all night and did not
return till Monday morning, when we heard
shut the capitulation was made.
We were, then informed, that the garrMbn
should inarch out with all the honors of war,
each battalion with two field pieces, toÃofch,
Tbiil, Bommel, and Utrec'.n, with perfect li
berty to remain in the service of the State,
and to fight against any enemy.
)n virtue of this capitulation, this after
noon about four o'clock the battalion of
Orange-Naflau, with a part of that of Dam,
Inarched, drums beating, colours flying, and
two field pieces, through the gates of Bo ch.
At three o'clock about 45) men, infantry
and Cuirafliers, entered this place from the
French Camp.
Fortunately few lives have been loft. One
Burgher was killed by a bomb, and an Apo

garrison have not loft a single man. What
number the French have loft we cannot tell.

In the infiirretftion which took

That France is in a Hate of war

Our ftiips of War have been un

Of the prucefs now pending in

little necert'ary as it is highly dan

These will be records to which the

DUMOURIER.
DUTCH MANIFESTO
In anfwerto Dumourier's proclama
tion, a manifefto has been pub
lilhed, which confutes, and at the
fame time treats with contempt
that idle gasconade, as well as the
obicure faction called the Batavi
an Committee, to which it is more
immediately addrefl'ed, âit con
cludes thus :
WE rather expect that all citi
zens, laying aside any parry spirit
which disunites them, will unite
their efforts to ours and to those of
all the true friends of his country,
to defend and preserve, under Di
vine protection, the territory which
has given them birth, and in which
they have been bredâthat they
will snatch religion and true liber
ty, those guarantees of our h.appi
nefs, from the insupportable yoke
of foreign and barbarous hordes.â
We expert every thing from their
courage and bravery ; and we are
persuaded that they will not fuffer
thenvfelves to be intimidated by the
exaggerated ilatement of the forces
which are represented as advancing
against them. We persuade our
selves, that they will neither for
get the invincible valour with which
pur immortal ancestors refilled fuc
cefsfully these very Frenchmen, at
a time when the greatest powers in
Europe did not, as at this day, com
bat with us, but on the other hand,
â were leagued with our enemies ; â
nor the lituation of our country,
which more especially in this fca
fon, op.poses unfurmountable obtta
cles to an hoftije invasion ; no, the
diligence and energetic of
the government, which will neglect
nothing to secure the fuccefies of
our 'common efforts ; nor, lastly,
the efficacious succours weeexpertc r t
in a little time from our faithful
allies. If after so many important
considerations, they may still need
a motive to confirm them in their
resolution to facrifice every thing
to the defentre of their dear coun
try, we will place before their
view the example of our neighbors
the inhabitants of the Austrian Ne
therlands, who have called on and
welcomed as friends, the very ge
neral who dares to call himfelf their
deliverer, and those very French
men he commands ; those Belgians
now reap the bitterest fruit of their
heedless credulity.
Deign, thou Supreme, and All
puifl'ant Being, who haft lo often
extricated this republic from the
1110 ft imminent dangersâdeign to
preserve it at this day from such a
deliverance, and from such friends.
Caution to Ladies.
Lady Elizabeth Pratt has kept her
bed this fortnight, from the dread
ful accident fbe met with by burn
ing her handkerchief and head
diefs. She was alone when it hap
pened, and had the presence of
mind to endeavor to roll herfelf in
the carpet, which unfortunately was
nailed to ihe floor. Her cries, on
the discovery of this, brought Mr.
Stewart to her aififtance, who imme
diately pulled off his coat, threw it
round her, and extinguiflied the
flame. Her ladyship is attended by
Dr. Karqubar, whose method ofcure
is a very limple one, namely, the
application of ice, which e*trai!is
lite fire, without leaving any fear
after the part affctfted is healed.
An industrious exhibiter of rari
ties, commonly called a fhew-maii,
is now tr?velling round the coun
try with Mr. Burke's dagger,which
he difplavs to the curious at a pen

SAYS A CORdESrONDENT,
A cursory view of foreign intelligence will
serve to shew that the (pint of fa)(hood and
nnfreprefcotation was never more alert than at
the present day. Not to advert to palpable con
tradictions in the European prints, it is evident,
from the greatest part of the paragraphs relative
to the Belligereut powers, that the writers anti
cipate events agreeably to their wishes, and in
inanyinftances palm them on the public for fa&s.
âThe public is frequently cautioned to be on
its gnard against the mifrepreftmations of
French affairs in the Engli(h papersâbut it is
evident that there are Britiih publications as
much-in the interest of Franco as any publifbed
:n Parisâthe partizans on both fides no doubt
aregjilty of great exaggerationsâbut is it aU&
that truth has fled from the earth, and that not
one fjjlitary printer can be found who finds it
for h is inteteft to pubhfh a just reprefentauon of
tS: hnpoitant tranfa&ions now pafiitig on the
European theatre ?
In afligning rcafons for the war wich France,
an Enghlh paper fay?'â u It is the cause ot hu
man nature we are engaged to support; of a
conilitution which our an:eftors cemented with
their blood, which is the source of our pride,
and the foundation of our happmefs againfta (yf
tem of innovation which has swept before it,
like an overwhelming torrent, the sacred infti
tuiions of antiquity, the pure consolations of re
ligion, the duties of domestic life, and the obli
gations between man and man. In ancient
limes war was conduced with dignified feroci
ty ; among the moderns it has been carried on
with fcieniific (kill: the recent hollilities of the
French have been ferocious without dignity,
and fcientific without humanity ; and if we
meet their forces with fucb accumulated horrors,
we have still the cotnfoit of refle&ing, that to ab
stain from war is impoflible, and to doubt of
success would be impious.*'

COMMU NICATIO N S.
It is not without example to find porfons who
like ihe treason, and vet despise the traitor.
Those who throw rotten eggs at a government,
may do a piece of fcrvtce to the public. But
.those who like to fee the government thus
adorned and peifumed, would be afhamcd to be
seen in the company of the men who funiifh
their amilfement. These Grub Greet writers
may fay> the world is not our friend, nor the
world Ylawâand therefoie that dcfcription of
pcrfons very naturally, some will fay very justly,
make war upon both.
We are commanded to love our enemies.â
There are in cveiy country perions who find the
laws their worst rnemiesâenemies, which infliÂ£l
impnlonmcoi, fines and ftiipcs. This is too
much 10 be forgiven. It is cheaper, as well as
more honorable, to car*y on war with such per
sons, than to buy a peacp.
i What is public credit!âlt is the animating
. principle of public ejiertionâwhich, having
braced the nerves of indtuftry, and fist the
machine of general enterprize in motion is at
the present moment, the tenure on which
hundreds of tbouf.tnds of our fellow-citizens
JtoM the means of subsistence.
"Every attempt (and many are made) to
depreciate the public confidence in the honor
and faith of tbe government of this conntry
is a fti oke at the vital principle of our fecial
exiftencc.
It has been ca'led an in'ult to republicanism
for the free citizens of the United Statet to
cxprels their feelings on the fate of the un
fortunate King of France ; but the people
of this country know how to diftingnifc be
tween the principles of humanity and jullice,
and thole which cast a (hade on the tuft c.iufe

CUM ingratum dixeris, tnniadixijli; that is,
tax a man with, ingratitude, and you accu/e
him of every Jpedes oj baseness : This ancient
maxim applies to nations as well as to indi
viduals. For what is a nation but an aggre
gate of moral agents, receiving its charac
ter from rhc'ir principles and conduct ?
Sorry should I be, Messrs. Printers, and
ashamed at the fame time, were I to con
ceive myfelf the citizen of a nation damped
with the infamy of this fruitfnl crime. But,
nntwithftanding the unconcern exprefled by
some, and the exultation by others, at tbe
late tragical event In France, 1 trust and be
lieve that the fentitrent of pity has greatly
prevailed throughout tbefe dates, and that
the fenty>ility of tbe sternest republicans a
mong us, has been Ihocked and affliQed at
the bloody deed.
Louts, fays Thomas Paine, is the befi friend
of the American people, who conjider themjelves as
indebted to him for their liberty. Shall Americans
be aihamed to profefs in their own lard of liberty
a sentiment thus hazarded in the face of the
Convention ? Forbid it decency* forbid it*
gratitude, forbid it humanity. Neither the
vicissitudes of human grandeur, nor the fluc
tuation of power and dignities, can obliterate
the remembrance of a benefactor, from a
generous mind. But least any ef our country
men fliould fufpeel the policy of Louis, to
wards America, of being felfifli and insidious',
the declarations of our Congress will proba
bly go as far to remove such suspicions, as
the hints of tl>e National Convention to esta
blish them. For my own part, lam so far an
American, as to glory in the persuasion, that
the men principally instrumental in our hap
py revolution, exhibited more political wis
dom, more public virtue, more humanity and
courage, than the world ever beheld on such
an occaiion, or is ever likely to behold again.
The hand cf God was with them and the na
tion ; for both profeffed to believe in, and
worship himâHear how this illustrious band
Â£ patriots exprefled themselves in August,
1 u Tfye treaties between his inoft
li Christian Majesty and the United States of
41 America, so fufly demonstrate his wisdom
" and magnanimity, as to command the re
" verence of all nations. The virtuous ci
-44 tizens of* America in particular can never
u forget his beneficent attention to their violated
44 rights, uor cease to acknowledge the hand
u of a gracious Providence in railing them up
u so poweiful and illustrious a friend. This
44 AlTembly are convinced, that had it relied

44 only the independence of these States would
44 have been universally acknowledged, but
44 their tranquility fully eftablilhed," Long in

These and similar sentiments refpetting;
Louis XVI, are the iuft grounds of the great
pain, which the fans of freedom in America expe
rience on account of that unfortunate Mo
narch j and surely the profefling apostles of
human liberty, and the regeneration of na
ture, will not condemn one of the fineft senti
ments of the heart of Man, especially when
employed in commiserating the misfortunes
of a Prince, who, as Shakespeare fays of
Duncan^

THE Author is sensible that the firft edition
of his American Geography (which makes Part

j feÂ£live, in others erroneous, and in forne offen
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was his
desire, in the present edition, to fupplv the defi
j ciencies, correal the errors, and meliorate the
offenfive parts of the last. To aflift him in this
business, he has received many valuable commu
nications from the heads of departments in the
genera! government, and from gentlemen of re
fpeftabihty in the several states. The defcrip
tioo of foreign countries (which composes Part
11. of the above wbrk) has been carefully com
piled from the most approved writers on Geo
graphy, and ufeful information introduced from
the discoveries of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and refpeftable authors. Indeed, no pains
nor expenfc have been spared to render this work
the mofl complete, accurate, and ufefulaoy
ever offered to the public.
