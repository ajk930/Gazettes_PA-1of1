Mr. Russell,
THE following Stanzas were lately compofrd
at Cambridge, and inferibed to a gentleman in
that town, whose taste isfo pleasingly exhibited
inhtyrlegant Seat; and of which a recent dis
play reflects no less honor on his generality. A
beautiful current, which his Fi(h-Pond difcharg
Â«d, had long flowed unnoticed, through a low
groujid to the banks of the Ch afc l f.s. On one
fide ps this rivulet, he raised a gravel.walk, pre
pared a receptable for a larger stream, fbaded it
with willows, and terminated the Mail with an
arch, through which the water is emitted, by a
gÂ«nlle and transparent cascade. This modern
iyccufn has enrolled tbe daughters of beauty in
the academy of Peripatetics ; and the Mujes, who
warbled on the banks of JHjfus, have consecrated
it with their lyres, to Apollo and Kygeia ;

No. VI.
CIVILIANS have remarked three stages
in lite progress o>f(bcietyfiombarbari(in
to refinementâdittinft from each other, aT.d
marked by a peculiar cbarafter.
The tranlition from one of tiiefe to tfiÂ«
other, is formed by almost imperceptible gra
dations.
Those countries which have prefentefl! 11s
with man in his rudest form, have uniformly
exhibited him in the character of a hunter.
Thus the inhabitants 6f the I (tends in the At
lantic and Pacific oceans, the natives of thia
country, the original inhabitants of ancient
Greece, and many other countries of anti
quity, when firft visited by civilized people,
knew 110 other means of subsistence than hui}t
ing aud fiihing.
In this state tber have few ideas of private
property. Tiieii weapons, the game they
have taken ia the chcce, the fruits they have
gathered, and in general those things which
they immediately occupy, are the only objtfts
to which they claim an exdulWr right. The
idea of personal appropriation is formed only
by the progreifive improvement of manners.
Wen, in this stage of society, depend wholly
nponthe success of hunting and fitting, and
those fruits and vegetables which the earth
produces withoflt culture for theii subsistence
âwhen these fail, they are reduced to the
moil fatal extremity. An unfavorable sea.
son, a dearth among the animals, and the
ftratagertls of a neighboring enemy, may op
preft them with all the miseries (if pinching
neceflity. tt is to the famines which have
taken place in confequente of these evils, that
we mat afctibe the practice of devouring one
an6ther, which has been found to prevail
among savage nations Fear and wans, ex
cept the thirst for revenge, are the only springs
of aftioft in the savage stateâbunting and
war are their thief employments. Surround
ed by dafigfers on every sideâexposed to tl e
rapacity of ravenousbeafts on the one hand,
and hostile neighbors on the other, the favsge
is kept in perpetual alarmâThe peculiar
imperfections of the savage (lateâthe want
of known and acknowledged lawsâof a com
mon judge to adjnft the differences that may
k'ife, and of authority to enforce those equi
table decisions 6f nature and reason, to whict
even savages are competent, cherilhes tliÂ«
feed of contention, and multiplies the num.
ber of wars. The constant call for war, tb<
growing scarcity of game, and confequeni
difficulty of the chace, mult netefTarily ex
cite their ingenuity and improve their dexte
rity ih the invention and u(e of their wea
pons. As their numbers increase as th'eir ih'
tercourfe with each other becomes more Ire.
qbent, and their ideas expand, their wantj:
multiplyânew arts become neceiTary., an<
more provlfiort is requisite than their ordinary
sources of supply will furnifh. Expericnci
would soon teach them that foriis animals ar<
superior to others, in delicacy, in flavor, am
in nutritive virtueâthey would Toon lean
also to diftingoilh the trainable from the fe
rOcioos, the gregarious from the mUre folita
ty; these they would collect and tameâthe;
would erefl enclosures to prevent their war.
derirtg, to distinguish them from others, am
designate therrt as their own. Thus by de
grees they would exchange the hunter'? so
the pastoral life, and divert their care fro"
the chace t6 their flocks. In every step 0
this progrelfion new wants arise, new arts&r
invented, and every social improvemen
makes proportional advances. Innumerabl
causes cbntribute to the improvement an
progre/s of the pastoral life. The greate
certainty and abundance of subsistence it fui
nifhesâthe easy means of procuring itâth
facility of guarding more eflfeftuallv again
the evils of famine, and the leisure it afibrd:
render intercourse with each other more fr<
quent and more desirable, and mature an
strengthen their social difpoiitions.
The neceftity of being in the neighbourhoo
of springs and riversâthe extraotdinary fei
tility of pa ticulat spots of earth, or the sea
of enemies, may have firft suggested the idc
of a permanent residence- The accident;
di r Covery of the ififiu'ence of the refufe at
filth of their hovel.s in refiefh'ng a barren (
exhaufled foil, and In increaluig ahd prefer'
ing the fertility of a new one, with fomc a
tempts to cultivate and rear those plan
which experience had taught them we
wholesome and nourishing, may have ipfen:
bly brought them froiti pasturage to agricv
ture.
Thisis the foundation of civil focietyâai
until this takes place, society canriot be fa
to exist. This is tbe natural order of
gradations by which a nation advances fro
rudeness to refinement, when left to the 11
pulse of its own genius, and the ordina
course of things. Accidental causes diftu
1 this progress. A nation is sometimes, by t
force of particular circuraftauces, bra 14immediately fro.n bunting to agricultureâ
ThiÂ» leeras to haÂ»e been tlie cafe with tiie
.ancle,it Greelcs and tlie Peruvians. Other*,

fouic-thing that belong to every state ol ini
provejjAenT, without taking a cltara{hr lr-oni

tranlitiort it f ; from one |.erind ot im
provement 10 another. Tlie progress or nar
nont in.refine.-rnr li by no mea's equal; a
combination of natui al and moral causes may
accele-ate or retard thjir advancement â
.V favorable climate, a genial foil, a healthy
atmnfijlieve, rapid population, iecurity from
invasion, and domeltic peace, flatten their

1 hav a goode undurftandirig. But if this be
aule blarny, and if I have no undurftanding
at aule,,this needs nat hindor me from riting
abaute poll/ticks, becaife this is a thing that
every bodie undurftands. But it is time for
me to be after t'elling you what it is I mane.
The society of United Irish men are fartinlv

that it has broat to the Frenfhmen, riches,

in the name of the blefiit virgin, let us aule
drawe our fpedes, and flautn, and fhilelier,
and hav a grand bodderation of our aun. But
iff we fee that it has made the Frenfhmen poor

In the mane time, until that hapy yeer lha]

Lafl night dispatches were receiv
ed by their High Mightinesses fro.n
the Prince of HefTe Caffel, Governor
of Maeitricht, dated March 20th,
from which we learn, that a 1110 ft
bloody & decisive battle was fought
011 Monday the 18th inft. between
the Austrian army, headed by the
Generalimmo Prince of Saxe Co
bourg, and the French forces un
der the command of Gen. Dumou
rier.
*1 he following are the particulars
which have transpired refpedlirio
this important event : ' Â°
Qothe 17th Jnftai.t the I'rench
394
drove the AuArians from Tirele
mont, after a nioft heroic refinance,
and with very coriliderable loss.
F1 lifted with this success, Gen.
Duniourier made preparations 10
attack the Auftriaus, on ilie iÃlh,
between Landen and Dormel, at
the dift.jnce of fix Englifli miles from
St. Tron, where the Imperial Royal
armies had iheir head quarters. â
The attack commenced at seven
o'clock in the morning, and conti
nued, with the molt dreadful daugh
ter, until half after five in the after
noon, when, through the fupetior
manoeuvres of the Aiiftrians,
and the cnnfnmmaie skill and intre
pid gallantry of the Prince of Saxy
Cobourg, Count de Clairfayt, the
the Archduke Ch.irles, the Prince
of Wurtemberg, and other Imperial
Generals, and the unexpeÂ«fied .arri
val of a corps of Austrian Cuirafliers,
Huffitrj, Challeurs and Dragoons,
t he ranks of the French werebtoke
through from all quarters, and the
latter obliged to take flight, and
leave the Auftriaus mailers of the
field.
Clairfayt and the Archduke
Charles performed prodigies of va
lour, and pursued the French fugi
tives, thousands of whom were cut
111 pieces}
The battle of Landen will form
an epoch in ihe annals of history,
, being a decisive pitched en
, tnull be followed by the
immediate evacuation of the Austri
an Netherlands.
The French fdnght like lions,
but their desperate fury, which.
â pierced twice through the left wing
of the Imperialists, could not avail
again ft the superior of the
Auftrians.
The Imperial arhl'y broke irp in
the morning of the 19th, tro pursue "
t heir glorious career,-and it being
impoilible the French dispersed "
hosts to rally,-the finaH-corps head
ed by Damourier, which made iu
retreat to Louvain, will be cot off,
and the Aufttians nvuft by thisrinfe _
be matters of Bruflels. The Nati
onal<Guards, to the number of
- 70,000 men, are drawing together,
but having neither djfcipline nor
Â»iÂ»rder auixxog them, they 111 uft JOOll

High and Mighty Lords,
" I have the honor to report to
your High Miglitinefles, that I have
been inverted by the French troops,
since the 23d of February last. On
the 20th, at five o'clock at night,
one Berneron, calling hiinfelf Camp

to which I an!were# in writing,
Ti far from intending togiveupthe
place which was entrusted to me,
1 should defend it as a mnn of ho
nor." Accordingly on the next
day, about y o'clock in the morning,
the enemy commenced a very lively
bombardment of this fortrefs; at
tacked it, at the fame time, with
red hot balls: bombs, and grenades.
This latted, with the interval of
feme moments, until the 9th of this
month, when, at it o'clock in the
morning, I received a ferond sum
mons. to which I gave again my re
fufal in writing. Upon this refu
fal, the cannonade recommenced in
the nioft violent manner, and it Con
tinued, at intervals, till this mo
ment, 10 o clock in the morning,
when 1 perceived that the enemy
had retired. I sent diretfly a de
tachment, which found the batteries
of the enemy abandoned, with fomc
cannon, two mortars, and a great
quantity of amunition and siege u

GENERAL DUMaURIER'
Was bom at Cambrai, and has attained the
fifty-fifth year of his age. His father enjoyed
the post of Regulating; CommifTary iti that
City, and had luificient interelt to place his
son, now Commander iti Chief of the Northern
Army, in a Royal Military School of Artillery,
âan art in which he riiuinguifned hinifelf so
eiliftualiy, and made such a progress, as very
early to attain high Military Rank. At the
battle of Crevelt, where he had already the
rank of Field-OiÃcer, he received seventeen
wounds, by one of which he loft a finger joint.
He was afterwards, in i763,Quartermafter
General of the Army in Corsica, commanded
by General Marbeof.
In the sequel, he was promoted to the de
gree of Major-General-Commandant at Cher
boÂ«rg, under the orders of the Duke de Reve
ron and d'Harcourt. When Louis XVlth.

efteern to the Commandant, by prelenting him
with a superb fnuff-box, ornamented with his
portrait, and enriched with magnificent dia-
monds..
Previously to the commencement of the
French Revolutions, and in the course of his
military advancement, he wa's several times
charged with political and military negotia
tions abroad. Among others, he received

FROM A CoRR fiS/ONDENT.
The order and economy of the arniy dc
ferves great praile ; ftlence, induftty, and
discipline. Every hiornin(i after parade at
to e'ploek, the troops arp drawn out to an
eminence at some dtftance IVom the encamp
ment, to fire at targets ; the mulketry and
riflemen; with premiums for the firft, se
cond, and third best (hots.
The fliooting of the mulketry aftoniftied
me ; and our hunters may undervalue the re
gular troops, as marksmen, but I have been
at ihooting matches in the country, and have
never ifeen better shots by rifles, than on this
occasion.
The appearance of the fojdiery is good, as
to dress,. health, &:c. The cavalry are in
good plight ; and disciplined to leap overob
ftacles, and afccnd and descend heights at a
gallop.
The general seems to J|ave set his heart,
on having the army in good state ; and being
able to cfface our former defeats, by a signal
revenge upon the enemy. Xt nuift mortify
him inuclij as it does me, to think that after
all this, we 9t e to have the bubble of a treaty,
these troops discharged, and war again in a
ftort time. â¢ . - .

" WE ARE ONE."
This is the motto of the free and indepen
dent citizens of United America.
The union of the States was cemented by
the adoption of the New Constitutionâthat
palladium of our lives, liberties and property.
The Government firmed under this Con
ftitution,has been administered with wisdom,
honor and patriotic independence of spiritâ
The evidence of this declaration is written
in the book of experience, and in the irrefifta
ble conviction of our sensesâand every grate
ful, unprejudiced mind, rcjoices to add a vo
luntary acknowledgment of the benignAdif
ptcfation-. of a fuperintendirg Providence,
that gives to a happy people, t';e option cf
perpetuating totheiateflpofterity the bleillngs
of u peace, liberty and fafety."
The prefsnt is an eventful crifnâin what
an important situation is this country placed !

neither awed by the restless among ourielves,
nor intimidated or cajoled by foreign powers
to swerve from the ftrifteft principles of na
tional honor, justice and neutraMty*âthis line
of conduct tlet nuift, chey wiji pnrfueânor
is there a genuine friend to the peace and
prosperity of the country, who is not firmiy
perfhaded of the truth of this afferti'-n.
Let a manly confidence then he reposed in
the SupremsExecutiyeof the United Statesâ
the molnent their independency of conduct is
infringed upon, our security is loft. Pa ft ex
perience jullifies this confidenceâand every
pofiible inducement that can affect the best
feelings of the patriot, conspires to give
energy to the injunction.
It is cot poflible that an enlightened Ame
rican fliould not feel interested in the freedom
and happitie's of mankindâWe have experir
enced, and we enjoy too much, not to wish
that the nations of the earth less favorably
situated, ftould participate in the blessings of
a free and righteous governmentâbut our
present situation is exactly what thole must
desire it to be, who anticipate similar enjoy
ments. Change the circumstances ot this
countryâembarrass its governmentâdestroy
the equrpoize of its neutrality and impartia
lity in the prefect calamitous war, and clouds
and darknels immediately impend.
The politics of some among us, are as wild
as their theories of government are absurd.
It is mod devoutly to be wilhed, that as this
country is happily placed in so remote a fla
tion from the scene of war and coni'ufioti, that
its government may not be diflurbed by any
extraneous or foreign influenceâthe intro
duction of principles lioftile to its existenceââ¢
or by afl'ociations alien to the proper business
and impetus ofa constitutional adminUlration
of our affairs.
While the glow of beneveleriee warms the
bosom of every free American, let us ndt-Niif
t;ike the imprcfllons of a momentary entfiy
fiafm for the dictate; of wisdom, jufti.ce and
found policy. The days of anarchy are pastâ
aiid the line of conduct which the bcft and
mod permanent intcrefti of the United States
point out, is as plain as infallibility tan deli
neate it. Nothing can diverge more d reftly

The spirit of Liberty is to a people what a
virtuous disposition is to an individual.âlt con
sists in a well ordered mind. The hatred of go
vernment is as inconsistent with a just ferife of
liberty as the hatred of laws is with virtue.â
Liberty in short is reason. Government which
is the reason of the whole society is essential to
liberty ; Prejudice, pafljon, and frenzy on the
contrary are the causes and the fymptonvsof
slavery. We hear of men preaching down go
vernment and the laws, and they pretend greac
zeal for the cause of while they ad
dress themselves to the paflions. This however
is absurd, whenever a people are gross aijd weak
enough to believe the t2les which are always
propagating against government, and are rash
enough to fufpeft and hate it in corifcquence, the
spirit of liberty is gone fiom amon?; then). A
people thus yielding 'o their paflions can no
more pieferve their privileges than a man can
preserve his virtue who on every temptation
breaks away from the restraint of reason.
There has been a clamoring party ever since
there was a government to abuseâand such there
will be as long a* equal laws restrain inordinate
paflions.

IF George may fend a proclamation,
To warn the people thro* the nation,
Sure Thomas should confine his caies,
To his own government affairsâ
But if to give such edifls force,
State Heralds must come out of course ;
We may predict the time will come,
When George- in turn mujl echo Tom ;
Or dire confufion through the land,
May shew we're bound by rope of sand.âÂ»

And earthquakes i'nake the land and ocean.

TO THE PUBLIC.,
THE Author is sensible that the fiift edition
of his American Geography (which makes Part
I, of the above work) was in many iuiiances de
feÂ£live, in others erroneous, and in some offen
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was his
desire, in the present edition, to fupplv the defi
ciencies, correal the errors, and meliorate the
offenfive parts of the last. To aflift him in this
business, he has received many valuable commu
nications from the heads of department* iq the
general government, and from gentlfc-men of re
achability in the several states. The dejfrrip
tion of foreign countries (which compofeli Part
11. of the above work) has been carefully com
piled from the most approved writers on Geo
graphy, and ufeful information introduced from
the discoveries of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and refpedlable authors. Indeed, no pains
nOr expense have been spared to render this work
the moll complete, accurate, and ufeful qf any
ever offered to the public.

CHARLES BULFINCH, Sec'ry.
The following character of the above work,
is given in the Review of the Majachufetts Ma
gazine, for Jan. 1793 :
" This is a very ufeful work, and is no ill
proof of the judgment and indtiftry of the author.
The rules are laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are fufficient for their tl
luftration. One part of the work derferves par
ticular commendation. We mean that which
the author stiles " Mercantile Arithmeticlt
occupies a confiderablc portion of his book, but
not more than its im-portauce will juftify. We
would recommend to the young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to this branch.
He wiH find its principles well explained. Ami
rtiould ire make himfelf master of rhem, lie will
always have reason to acknowledge his obliga
tion to the judicious and laborious author. We
cannot but congratulate the rifiag generation on
account of the many ufeful produÂ£lions which
have lately appeared; and in which their im
provement has been principally confuhed.â
Among those productions we mud place this
treatise of Arithmetic. We should be wanting
in justice to the author, should we not ac^ llOW '
ledge that his "work is in reality that which its
title importsâThe Preceptor's Assistant,
or Student's Guide."
