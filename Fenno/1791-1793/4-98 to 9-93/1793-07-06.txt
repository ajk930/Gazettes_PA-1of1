Jixlrafl ej-a letter from a'ginthmm in Sir
" I h-ivr found out a variety of innnry
Coining pnt&ice* here, highly difgracifal
I think to tlie parties, to the country and
its fcnvs; and in the instances I fhali men
tion. likely to do infinite mifchiefs to the
vast circulation of Spanish iilver in the
United States 1
" As early as May 1791, they began
with the American copper cent, only up
on reading the resolve of Cong re Is to
have such a money, and the getting over
a,p4Â«; of the. Am? 1 ican 'eagle. XhÂ«e
were three different forts of these cents
made here, all with the President's head,
not a bad likeness and tolerably well exe
cuted. I find however, tlris was merely
an attempt of some artists here to induce
Congress to give Birmingham the order
for coinage of their copper money.
" I have seen pattern cards of {hillings,
frxpencts, and hijlf'pencea, so base, as to
be marked for sale at the rate of 28, 30,
and 36 /billingsior the guinea.
Quarter doUarj and piftareens, (but
principally quarter dollars) cut into three
or rather four pieces. An exait triangle
taken out of the centrc. The other
three pieces of.debafcilfrlver, nevertheless
to be run off as halves of the quarter dol
lar. The central piece is again coined
down, and isleft rather plain ici the dies
(which were (hewn to me with ps*e* of
the money) and the crescent formed pie
ces ttt uck to nearly as' jraffible the Itamp
ofj that part of a real Spanish quarter
dollar. The piftareens were worl'e exe
cuted.'
" I have also Teen Dutch ducats, and
dollars which were done as follows. The
ducat was cut out of a pure piece of foft
fjlverto the proper size and to be ealily
bcadable in the finger a; pure ducats are;
there is then a thick amalgam of gold,
(which is made of quick silver and gold,
and then squeezed through lhammy leath
er) laid on this loft silver, and then llruck
in the press to the exad fixe and marks
of the Dutch ducat of date 1752. This
order came through Englilh merchants
from Holland and London, soon after
the declared and open afliftance given by
England to their high and mighty allies
the Dutch. The value of these forged
ducats is about one and sixpence Iterling,
wotfcmanfliip and aU. They weigh about
2 dwts.'y grs. and by weight the real du
cat would fell here for nearly ten (hillings,
so that here rests a neat profit of eight
and sixpence on each piece.
'j Spanish milled dollars are of three
forts, two only of which I have seen.-â
The baser one is cut from a well silver pla
ted Iheet of copper of due thickness, then
hooped around the edge with a fiver wire
so thick as not to expose the copper if
scraped moderately on the edge wi:h z
knife (a common mode here to de
ted base silver) and is then milled
to the copied dye, of which there
are more than one fort. They are
so well executed as to pass easily
among others, and are in value,
â worVtrranfiiip and all, about one and
sixpence.
<< The other and more pure dol
fat.Â«, the artills are more close and
secret about, as being a better tiling.
however come to Birmingham
in real Spanilh or Mexican dollars,
bought at the bank and 01 her pla
ces, sent down by land carriages,
about 10,000 at a time, in a calk,
and they are melted and recoined,
copying as exactly tire old impref
fions| of which there are three or

ago of his molt Catholic Majesty,
nine pence of silver being taken from
each of the new coinage, and these
new ones want but little alloy to
br ing'them to a proper thickness ;
two one-h:ilf, or three pence on each
piece is ample pay to the at tift here
for dies, recoining, fending back to
London, and all other expences, so
that the public upon whom they are
ptKivlofe nine pence in every four
an<t fix pence, and the emitter has a
benefit of (i* pence on each.
Upon close invefligation, no doubt
