THOUGHTS ON THE
State of American Indians.
(Continued from No. 104, of '.his Gazette.)
No. IX.
ANOTHER principle which contributes
to form the baits of civil society, and
â¢which dHfcjngnifHes social from savage man*
ners, is the eftabiifhment and management of
private property. In the earlj of fp.
are fti'anfcers to rhofe diftmftions
of property which in more pojifhed pe
riods. Land is more connected with the na
tion than with individualsâthe territory
which belongs to the tribe, is cultivated for
their use, and each receives what is fufficient
for his necessities.* As their numbers jn
creafe, as their wants multiply, and society
advances, the idea of appropriation is fqrm
fcd. They become delirous of a better provi
lion than the proniifcuous industry of many
copartners affords, and by degrees withdraw
their regard from the community, and diredl
their views more to their o\v;i inferel^.
At length when perfbnal ciiftinCtioo arises
from an accumulation of the iirnple produc
tions of nature, or the acquisitions of industry,
they begin to claim the property of the foil,
as well as the fruits which it yields. The oc
cupation of land enfuet, and the agricultural
(late placeâthis fo.rmi a new asra in the
progress of manners, and corftitutes the true
foundation of civil society. From this source
all improvements in the various departments
of social life directly or indirectly flow. Ik
gradually changes the habits and manners of
a people, nnd intipduces means' of eminence
and refpe&ability unknown in the savage
stateâit confirms and improves the idea of
frigate propertyâit necefTirikattaches thenj
to a particular spotâleads to a division of
lands, to industry in cultivating and enriching
themâ to.tl.te conftruflum of proper habita
tions for the arcoipmndajtion of their families,
and tofje arts subservient tq purposes.
Agriculture also birth to ar(s, to com
merce and to lawsâprevents famineâacce
lerates populationâcreates ma jf- new attach
ments â'pens new fourecs of enjoyment, and
strengthen* the bauds which connect qnd fnpr
the diverged inteiefts ofiiifiety. Tl*
fti-plus produce of the farmer creates a fund
for the maintainanceof artificers, whole joint
(kill and industry are neceflarv to give perfec
tion and extent to their prndu-ttions. These
agpiq return ilie farnier ijij ravy ials
converted into some more agreeab'e and ufe
ful form. As arts multiply, the practice of
exchanging arte commodity for another takes
innumerable ties are formed whicfi
fentent the interest aÂ»Fefyogs ps, men-*
enlorci the obligations j-o mutual
and afliftance. and sweeten the charms of so
cial intcrcourle.

Agriculture further facilitate', .the means
of providing iubfiftenceâencourages mar
riage, by the profpeft of an eafv and fee Ore
fopportâleffens tin- danger of famine, and
multiplies the number m:d augmerttS thi hap
pineft of the human species.
11 gives rifp to various employments which
kindle thefparlcs of emulation, rouse the in
tent powers of genius, exrite invention, and
contribute to enlarge the bounds and multiply
the objects of human knowledge. Thus arts,
fe'ences, laws and government, all ultiniate'y
flow from the eftablifhmenr~of private pro
perty and. the cultivation of the foil.
Thi- reprefeptation is perfectly coincident
with the experience of pad ages. Tie an
cient history of Greece, of China, of Ger
many, of Pern, ami of forne other countries,
informs us vfaat land it* the infancy of those
nations was common,and nfcribes thexlivifion
of it to their firft So. hiphlv Hid
'' thofS mttva* eftinw-e Xhe effafeliffcrncnf of
agriculture, that the most of them paid reli
gious homage to those fovcreigns and legiila
tors who had been the inftrnmerts of intro
ducing them. To facilitate the reception
and improvement of this art, they were care
ful to furniih the means by which it might be
easily and fuccefsfully cultivated. For this
purpoie, they rendered it unlawful to destroy
those animals winch are n r ually employed in
the cultivation of the earth. Thus the laws
of Egypt, oflntlisi, and in late times of fom*
of the French idands in America, prohibited
the killing of oxen, the animajs generally em
ployed in agricnlture, on pe(la|tv ofde-ath,â
On the fame principle it is highly probable
that other laws were made to acre It rate the
improvement of agricuUure. '
If, as has been attempted to be (hewn, agri
culture lies at the foundation of civil society,
and isthefourcef oir. wbich allfocial improve
ments are derivedâ another important ilep
to betaken in bringing the savages to the
knowledge and enjovment of social lift is to
give them the idea ofpeTfbnal appropriation-â
a refidfinceaud thg cuUivarioa.of thÂ« (a 1#
this will be more easy :hpn may be at firft. ap
prehendedâthey are ar present in a state bor
dering upon it.âEach nation has a certain ter
ritory which it claim-: as its ownâthe limits >
of which are well known, and the encroach- :
ments on lyhich ,t>y other tribes is: a fruitful,
source of among; them. The transi
tion is easy from the idea of national to that
of individual appropriation.
The Germans and Peruvians exhibit t(ie
progress of this change in the habits of a na
tion.
This progress also jriay be more readily ef
fected among the Ii dians than in nations left
wholly to the impulse of their owp genius.
The inftruinents of agricultureâthe use of
domeftid animals and the use of metals which
greatly facilitate the prog re fs of this ast may
be them. Extraordinary encou
ragement may be giyenr then?. to excite
to industry and a perpetual afforded
by the profpieft of exchanging the produce
of their labour for articles which they Jhay
deem more desirable.

not step over. Men who have any principle
of virtue will honor it in others. Yet the
prctencc is that the honor done to one man is
a diftipiSion inconfjftent with the temper of a

Foreign Intelligence.
(Ger.) March 30.
ON the firft intelligence of the

the French marched to meet them
at the distance of half a league from
Mto* -pfVce.- -0e n e rÂ»lÂ» ii ft ill e aT)d
Wiih'pfen had their headquarters
at Btetzenheim ; Geo. Neuwinger
had his at Brngen, and those of Gen.
HoWgard were at this place. For
the two last days he had eltablifhed
himfelf at BeddefHeim.
The left wing of the Proffian ar
my firft attacked ihe entrenchmelits
of.Wnldalgefft.eim, from which the
f retich were driveh, after making
a very obftihate refinance. The
Prutliaii cavalry pursued the fugi
tives beyond Bingen, and cut to
pieces a great number of them with
their sabres.
During this time another body of
Pruflian troops attached the batte
ries on the mount of' St. Roch,w hich
were also carried; the French left
there a great many tilled & wound
erf ivith all their artillery, The
vii Tors took fbirie hundreds of prl
fonerS, among whom is the famous
General Newinger.
Whilst this was pafling on theleft
win jj; of the Prussians, the right ad
tanced again ft fhis place, and met
with great refinance by the way,
bnt the French were at length oblig
ed to fall back, and to save them
fel*es by flying during the night of
the 28th. The hnflars of Eben j>ur
fued them through this town, as far
as Alzey, where they cut to pieces
a part of them, and took a great
number prifohers.
As the Pruflians have blocked up
on one fide all the paflages to Mentz,
and are on thfe other in pursuit of
the enemy, the pofuion ofthe latrer
i? extremely critical. This d:w a
continual cannonade has been heard
foNÂ»i;rcls Mentz ; about one thou
sand three hundred French pril'on
ers have been already couduifted to
Biugen.
FRANCKFORT, April i.
General Nenwinger who has been
taken prisoner by the Prussians, was
brought hither this day with foine
more Frenchmen, and several pieces

judge of you the repielentatives of
the nation, whole confidence and
elteem you possess. I hey know
you better than the perfidious chiel
who deceives you, in order to de
base and dell toy you. His audaci
ous hand has violated the sovereign
ty of the people, in seizing thole its
repi elentatives whom the National
Convention had sent to you. His
crime is known ; he wants to gK'e
us a King ; his name is devoted to
infamyâhis head to the fcaffold ;
avenge your glory and your coun
try ; give up the traitor ; a civic
crown is t he reward that awaits yon.
French f.ildiers, if there could be
among you men who did not re
main faithful by the hnrrorof trea
son, let them at least learn to be
faithful by the fear of punishment.
You are only the advanced guard of
the nation ; flie is whole and entire
behind you, re:idy to protect with
her power tliofe who know how to
serve her, and to crush with her
thunder those who dare to be rebel
lious.

GENERAL DUMOURIER
TO THE
FRENCH NATION,
AT the time I published my fjrft Procla
mation I had founded the fentiruenu of
all the corps of the army under my command,
and ail of them l'eemed penetrated with the mi
series which an anarchial tyranny, exercijTed in
the name of the National Convention, had en
tailed on our country. All of them acknow
ledged unequivocally, that we could not live
without laws, and appeared to me to agree in
opinion, that the rc-ellablifhment of the consti
tution would restore us to peace and good or
der, without which it was impoilible for us
longer to cxift.
I had nut as yet rcafon to expert that there,
could be the kail wavering from an opinion so
well founded, and which also passed unanimous,
and indeed, who could have conceived that the
Ger.erais themselves would have fought, thro'
their ambition, or by afpiritof infatuation, to
alter the resolution of the army ? Dampierre,
StetenhofF, la Morliere, Rofiere, Chancel, Fer
rand, hive confpircd against their country, a
gainst a good cause, agairifb their companions in
arms, andagainft me, xo wh ni they made re
peated aiTurances that they enter tained the fan,e
principles with ourfdves. I flia.ll not reproach
theni with ingratitude their consciences will
one day punish them fufhcienlly ; butihall con
fine myfelf to this observation, that neither of
them eilecm the miscreants whom they now
i'otrveâThe Jacobins will, in their blind fury ex
ercise vengeance on them, for several of the
number are of the persecuted feÂ«sl; and the a
narchtfls will impute to them the disasters that
cannot fail to accompany the rash and sanguin
ary plans which that aff-mblage of factious cri
minal* will oppose to the regular plans of at
tack of the combined powers.
The revolt arranged by thef" traitors has for
A moment clwmged the fnce of wtoift the
commi.Tioners of the Convention, aifcmbled at
Valenciennes and Lille have employed measures
worthy of themselves to niillead the army, and
ftifle the pretended conspiracy which we all re
gard as a necessary a6t of virtue since it is the
only means-os saving France : They have em
ployed the arms of miscreants and cowards.
On the third of this month, fix fanatical vo
lunteers came to St. Amand, to poignard meâ
I protejilcd them from the fury of the foldicrs,
and sent them to-keep company with the four
comiiiiffiOners ; they will augment the number
of the I oftages.
On the 4th three battalions of national vojun
teers deserted the camp, without orders, and
threw themselves Into Va'enci<,nnes. I met them
on the road between St. Amand and Conde, at
the distance of about half a league from the lat
ter place. I wa then without f-fcoi t, as a father
111 the midfl of his children, (for such was the
tender name the whole army had bestowed on
me.) I had at the mod, 15 or I i perfoijs with
mc on horsebackâwhen the battalions were so
dastardly as. to assail me with a difchai ge of mui
qtietry. k'itcy kiTieci fevarai of'my suite, as well
as several horses.
They cut oIF the road t6 the camp to which I
tidied to retreat, and I was forced to favemy
feif, with a pare of the officers who accompanied
nie,l>y eroding the Scheldt in a boat, to repair
to the firil Imperial post. As it was not our in
tention to emigrate, and a 6 we were affuredthat
the a: my exprelfed a lirong indignation against
these afTaffin s as well as an attachment to the re
eftablifhment of peace -and good order, we re
paired at day-break to the camp. There, howe
ver, amidst reiterated protestations of attach
menr to t!ie principles that determined ns, we
remarked a mute and fallen agitation, which
made us judge that strong diflentions in opinion
prevailed, I addrefied each corps, and from each
corps received a reply tantamount to that made
on the preceding day.
Wifiiing-, however, after the remark we h&d
made, to repair to the head-quarters at St. A
mand, we learned that the corps of artillery had
formed the defigu of conveying their great park
to Valcnciennes; and that theplot of thefactious
men who mislead them to seize on us, to
convey us thither, and to make a merit of facri
fjLmg us to the vengeance of our tyrants. We
Jiad then one expedient only left, that of re
pairing to the Ifnperiai army, which we ought
to regarvt as our ally, after the frank and noble
proclamation by the general in chief by whom it
is commanded. Several corps <;f cavalry have al
ready joined us ; N feveral band> of infantry have
done the fame; and as soon as che Imperialists
ihalihavc entered the territory of France, not as
vanquisher*, and as wishing to dictate laws, but
as generous allies, who come to aid us in the re
establishing the conllitution, which can alone
flay the progress of the crimes and calamities
that menace France, many other corps wiil re
pair to unite chemfelvw to their brothers in
arm i.
I know the disposition of the army, and more
efpetiaUy thk of the troops of the line. Their
principles are, at the bottom, pure. They may,
fÂ«>r a moment, allow thc-rufelves to be hurried
away by the exaggerated opinions incnlcate-d "to
; but as the invincible courage they have
(hfplaycd during the present war, mult necefla
riiy 1>? accompanied hy the dÂ« fire of poffefiing
the laws they cannot find, unltfs in the constitu
tion, which wM destroy the odious tyranny of
anarchiils, they will be jealous of the public
elteem. They will bl fh at having, even for a
moment, been i.*pablc *f annexing their colours
to those of criminal licentioufhefs. They will
rally Hefide the brave troops who have only ac
companied me in my momentary retreat to re
enter France within two days at fartheft, andto
put an end to the vile disorders which cover all
France with mourning and terror.
I swear, in the name of my companions, that
we will not 'ay down our arms until we Ihall
have fuccecded in our enterprise ; aid our lole
design is to re-eftal}lilh the confiitution and con
ftitutional royaltyâthat no referrtmenr, mthirft
after vengeance, no ar.ibitiou.s itiotivc iways our

Thus did this nation (who at that timr were
spoken of by the English as tagged, lialf-(brved
Frenchmen, fed on f*og-fouj ) defy and triumph
over a combination of â¢eneihies neatly equal to
theprefent, ami upon rhe fame ground.
From this piece of history, the friends of
France, of humanity and equality, may learn
two i â portam points. Firit, That one hun
dred year# ago, the rnÂ»feries and fuife rings of
the .French nation, from a cruel government and
policy, *'as not a meie vulgar notion, hut a
leal grievance, that employed the Councils and
arms of nearly all fcuroi e to rediefs- it. And
secondly, That this fafee French people, under
this cruel government, badly clothed and fed,
by dim of nunilieu, bvavejey. activity and in
genuity, were it match tor England, the Empe
ror, and the P'inees of Germany, the Dutch)
ifely and Spain.â Good Heavens, ! of what
cbntradi&ion? are men capable :â In iSgi, the
Princes Â«' Europe olecge th~rnfrlvcs to their
God and to each other, that they will reform
the aby'fci.of the French government,and mend
iheconoÂ»Â»iop of-he,people,, buijire.not able co
do it. The French g'roju uuder tnefe iucrea
ling r.hufcs 61.e Sundrt d years longer, and then
rift together 2nd break their chains. And lo !
these firne Princes combine, with the tm.fl He
red ian ferocity,, to exterminate the people Â»>l
France, for doing of themselves, and For thera
fefves, what tfre Pr-nces wished and attempted
in vain to'do for them.
K nj/s and hereditary Princes. from Pharaoh
and Re ho boa m, down to the FÂ«edericks and
Geotgcs of our time, have beenjutl as benefici
al to Ihe human race, as fchool-bovs have been
to the rate of sparrows.âThey have killed more
men by Rindnefs, in acfrhiniflfering the benefits
of good government, than have b<en denroyed
by famrtre, pcftilende, earthquakes, and every
ether fcourgc tâ¢ which men are liable.âOur late I
