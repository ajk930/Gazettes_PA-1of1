FROM THE BALfmOlti i.VE.aiSG POST.
SIR,
Your ifijerting the JÂ»'!owing in your ufejul Paper t
tuill muck oblige A FRENCHMAN.
AMONGST thcMulattoes and rebel Haves,
\Vho plundered and burnt the Cape-Fran
cois, or slaughtered its unfortunate inhabit
ants, Stephen foverel and Leger Felicite
Sonthonax, who always lay they are delega
ted to the French Leeward lflands, to rcejta
blijh order and public tranquility, have declared
by their proclamation of the 2ift uit. that
the will of the French Republic, and that oj its
delegates j was to give freedom to all the Negroe?
who will fight for the Republic, under the or
ders of the civil cominttfarles, either against
foreign or domejiic enemies.
It should seem by this expression, that all
the formidable armies of the combiuated for
ces against Fiance were threatening the
French Lecwaid Ifhnds. Neveithelels it is
undoubted, that the Eiglifh, the only nation
to fear in these Teas, were without ary J'qua
dron at Jamaica ; and that the Spaniards kept
them elves within bounds to preierve their
boundaries. Therefore who were the true
enemies of France at Hifpaniola ? The rebel
slaves and free niuUttoes their instigators,
and the Haves ha ye been declared tree by the
delegates of the Republic. I* it for havjng,
since two years, laid waste that lb flour tffciug
country, by murdering the proprietors ai d
burning the properties ? tfcat they have been
called to fight against t(;e doniefiic enemies..
Who were tfien these domcftic enemies T the
white people who they had already fwprn de
finition to.
But now, how agrees that will of Che dele
gate ;ol the Frtuch Hi togive freedom
to ell the Negroes, with their oath so solemn
ly taken, on the 24th of October last, the day
of the reception of General Rothambeau, as
Governor of St. Domingo ? He do AÂ»ow y laid
tbe\, tiio kn.di oj men in thn country, the Jree*
men and Jluvts. He do t.naiu that Jtavt?*
jitxeffary to the Lu'onjai Such is the Â«?rV7 *f

Ask! now, the will of. the of th<-
Republic is to violate tleie properties, to give
the freedom to all tfte Negroes, to make them
,enjoy allthe rights of the French citizens; and that,
.fay they, fa the mission which the ftat'onaU onven
itwrrj and the Executive <.ouÂ»a/ of the Republic have
"iven to the Cttui (ommiJ[aries.
All the proceedings of the National Con

pives them such an impot tant miffior, to make
Jlpift enjoy afl the rights of the French citizens ?
would not all the world have resounded with.
ft> "its of that event !
jAlljes American, judge now between the
Gi ii Commissaries, appointed by Louis Capet,
ans the inhabitants of St. Domingo, accused
by rhen , or their in your own papers,
to infringers to the laws,, particularly to
thav which p,ives to the Mulattoes the rights
of Citizen?! There are infringe rs of the laws,
but the French nation will judge them. She

NATIONAL CONVENTION,
May 6.
C AMBON, after some remarkson
the want of harmony in some
parts of the Republic, offered a plan
of inltrudiion for the coinmiflioners
of the Convention. The discussion
on this was adjourned.
Ban ere read letters from Nantz,
dated the 3d May, by which it ap
pears that 600 men ofthe anny coin

back at St. Lcger, by the rebels,
with a loss of 100 men, and 2 pieces
of cannon.

TranflatcdJrom French Paters.
The ad mill id rat ors of Nantz write
ftaiing ibe iieceffity of immediate
afliftance, to repiefs live rebels in
the department. " But a little
while since a body of 4 or 5000 men
would have beer, fufficient to reprels
the infuri edtion ; but time has been
given thein to organize afidexercife
themselves ; they occupy more lhaii
25 leagues square of country, and
all the inhabitants of this territory
take an active part in the rebellion ;
they are obliged to march under
pain of death ; the emigrants and
priests have succeeded in making
some of these unfortunate people
believe that theyaie invulnerable.
âThose who are taken and con
demned to deaili go to the place ot
execution with demonstrations of
joy, and in expectation of an inelti
mable reward. These people ate
not to be despised, there are about
200,000 armed ; 1 hey march in
large bodies ; 40,000 have been
seen moving with order and celeri
ty. Extensive meafutes 11) alt be
'taken ; two armies fliould proceed
'against the rebels, one from Nantz,
from Saumur, and our ge
nerals fliould never attack but with
Cuperior forces."
Barrere read another letter giving
an account of some fnccefles of the
rebels against a small body ot patii

Another letter from Poitiers an
nounces tbat that city is menaced,
that the rebels have gone into Bi ef

After the reading of these letters,

to march againtt the rcbe viz.
Ten thousand regula>Â», 6000 re

the city were obliged to be flint to .
prevent this entljufiafin froiji being
an injury to the population and in"

May 7. The coniniillioners of the
convention on the vefteijt coalls
write that they had fulpended the
colonel and arretted 8 ofiii e< s of 1 he
Germanic legion, and Ill.it their
conduct was applauded by the pri

Cambon declared. thai oil the ioth
of this mouth, the Committee of
Public -Safety would render an ac
cotyiT of all their operations, and
would exhibit a faiclifiil ll.Sieun'ut
of I lie fit nation of the republic ;
that in the meanwhile it was his
duty to do away the impressions
which caltimnics ngainft that com
mittee may have produced, i eif^f jv.e
totheir expenditures, " calumnies."
said Cambon, " which ive have i {jtid

that the employ of this 1a ft menti
oned fund was'rt fiibjert of calum

fubjecl:, but that the committee
would never impair the fecreis of
this operation. Having called Bi if*
for an infamous libeller, a man con
neÂ«.led with Pitt, Cambon explained
the difficulties the committees had
to encounter in order to get things
a going ; â" When we began our
said he " the executive
power did not atft, and some parts
of it even yet cannot get to fliew
lufficient activity. The minidry of
Marine is very active ; ihar of war
is a labyrinth, %vhere it is impoHible
to find one's way : I defy any man
from getting through it. The mi
niller of foreign affairs often co-p

nor as active as we c6uld wish, aitd
in general it is plaiii, that the li'ii

COLOGNE, May 26.
ENERAL CUSTINE's attempt to deli-
VJT ver Mentz, though it had hot the d6firsd
fdcteO, yet tn part succeeded. The following
are the particulars of it * On the 16th tuft, he
detached 16,000 men from t ie army of the
Moselle towards Mentz; Â£nd to occupy the
attention of the Pruilian corps commanded by
the Prince de Hohenloe,an invasion was made
Into Deux Ponts; and about be
tween t?ie 16th and 17th, a corps of 5000 men
also sallied from Landau, and whiUt the de
tached corps filed off by Spires, this corps at*
tacked the Auftrians and the corps of French
emigrants under the Prince de Conde on one
fide, whilst General Cuftine, at the head of the
principal divifton of his troops, attacked them
on the other. The a (ft ion, which took place
011 the morning of the 17th near Belheim*
was very warm J the emigrants defended
themselves with great courage against supe
rior numbers, and the Anftrians ailed with
equal bravery. At the commencement of the
action itHvasTuppofea the French would have
had the advantage, but. the Imperialists and
emigrants remained matters of the field, and
the French were obliged to return to their
former posts without having executed the ob
je& of their attack, which was to penetrate
as far as Mentz. In the French account of
tlie aftioli, they attributed the failure of it to
two battalion* of volunteers, who by mistake
fired on their ownChafleurs, and a third threw
away their arms before they saw the enemy.
The Auftrians in this affcion, which lasted
three hours,had 132 men killed and wounded,
and the emigrants had 60 or 70. The latter
loft four cannou at the beginning of the ac
tion, but they were afterwards retaken.â
Some prisoners were taken on both fides.
One emigrant .ftiot himfelf rather than fuffer
himfelf to be taken. Though Gen. Cuftine
failed in his chief end, he reaped this advan
tage : Gen. Wurinfer the next day thought
aroper to remove beyond Queich, and fix his
camp there ; and the French advanced posts
are now in the place where those of the Auf
trians were.

fians and Hessians, were obliged, the former 10

fcoiitrj is fully confirmed. All the particulars
re Â»âº p'eftnt learn Â«>f thii event are, that the '
Frcnc'u in three columns, attacked the Auf
trians and the corps of Conde near B.liion,

of three hours, obliged their enemies, who
were much'iiilerior in number, to give wÂ»y_a
Tlie French General Ferrere had pulhed for
ward tu within an hour's march of Spires, but
there he was repulfcd by tlie Imperialist : tbe
lofj of the latter Is reckoned at 130 kilted and
as many wounded.
The corps of emigrant J fiiflered very nil uch,
and loft four picces of cannon, which, ham-'
ever, the Auftrians retook again.
It is laid, that'notwithftanding the advan
tage of this affair rells 011 the lide of tire
French, yet they loft a vast number tpo rente*
than the Aufti'ians and emigrants.
Bv accounts from Marvheiin, the Pfti/ii4cÂ».i

was .accordingly on the 23(1 inft. at daybreak
attacked .at the fame moment. The Dutch
troops attacked the enemy at Moucliin,drove
them beyond-Orchies, and took 60. prisoners.
The Pruflian troops attacked them at HÂ»f
non, di ove. them info the Abbey, and took
their fortifications, but could not force them
from the Abbey, 011 account of a large moat
filled with water, which surrounded it. The.
Imperial corps de reserve carried the en
trenchments at A'ubry, and the French, know, i
ing the importance of the post, made a num
ber of dsfperate effjfts the whale: day to re
cover it, bat were always repulsed 'with loli,
and were at last obliged to abandon a flag and
several cannon. The centre aflaulted anjl
carried the redoubts which covered the rigMt
of the brook of Ronelle, near Afaoi, and toot
7 cannon and ton waggons, with ammunition.
The left wing took the entrenchments hear '
MarefchS and Aftre, aiid the redoubts at Vil
lerfpol. In the latter they found & of
cannonj and 4 waggons wfth ammunition ;
and the Imperial troops of Baray took
redoubts and abattis of the enemy on the
caufwayat Quefnov, and pursued the French
beyond the woods of Anfrojpet. Night cool
ing on, Prince Cobourg and Gen. Clair fait
thought it proper to let their troops reft from
the fatigues of the day, with a determination
to attack the ne\tmorningearly the camps of
Fatnars and Anain ; but when the troops tile
next morning (the 24th) went to attack them,
they found the enemy had through terror,
during the night abandoned them entirely.
Part of the French forces threw tliemfelvcs
into Valenciennes, which the allied armies
immediately inverted, and part retired by
Denain to Bouchain and Cambrai. The
Piuffians alfotunnd the abbey of Hafnon eva-
cuated, which they took pofleffitra ofV ant!
went in pursuit of the enemy as far as Mat
chiennes. The French had m the coitrfe ps
the different attacks on the 23d, about aocb
men killed and wounded. The latter "tocjc
â¦ 300 prilbfters, among whom were a gcneial
and 20 officers.
Prince Cobourg's army is encamped to the

v " tW ariftocracjr and the Toalijion of

from us our liberty by the force of a rips* are
now preparing to destroy it by an intrigue
carried on by gold. Thefc were the days ap-
for the execution of their plot ; and

that of the 10th of May ; they wifti to deftrov

their plan 6f execution.
ii The conspirators aftei* having for a long
time prepared the minds of the people by
crafty speeches cloathedin patriotic Jangoace,
have milled thÂ« members of the . popular ft>-
cieties, of the cunftituted authorities, and
even of.(he Convention itfelf, lo as alinoft to
have petfuaded them that to favethe country,
a new infiirreftlon was neceflary. This in
furre<sti.on hns been organized by. clandestine
committees,. Every thing is preconcerted
atfd arranged. The disorder which they have
created in the Convention, will fer.ve as a
pretext for their projected riot. The wo.-
men too lend their afliftance, many of whom
have been farmed into regiments for this in
iquitous undertakingâ-at the moment when
their mifguidect arms are uplifted for the de
ftru&ion of their country, they endeavor to
perfiiade us that they are employed in saving

M A great majority of the CitizenÂ®, it Is
rue, have not been f. duced ; but our ene
nieshave succeeded in making fanatics of
hat credulous part of the people, who, more
remarkable for tbeir virtue than their under
standing, are easily milled, They have also
attempted to persuade the Volunteers, who
are going to Vendiee, that they ought not to
depart till after the execution of their prp-
" The iirfflrgents are t6 execute, on the
Members of the Convention and other Citi
zens, the proscriptions which have been or
dered bv their leaders. The proscri
bed will necelTarily find some defenders; a
cohibat will enfne, and such Menibers of the
Convention as (hall have been led astray, will
bÂ» theni(elves maffbcred. The National Re
presentation will then be deftrayed ; the
flahies of civil war will break forth, and the
depaftments and the armies will be divided.
f" A prey to anarchy, there no longer re
mains to France a rallying point. Duung
thÂ«fe intervals, all the armies at the feme

OF THE
of POLITICS
iIATE
FOR "THIS WEEK.
IF the last week seemed to be a week of tran
quility, and diftinguilhed, not for a multiplicity,
bur by a paucity of what are called news, or in
tcreiling events, the present week, like a storm
after a calm has manifefted various wrecks of
the hofhle and furious paffiont of contending
nations, and of civil discord.
The great effort made by the Fiench army
under
CUSTINE
to raise the ficge of Mayence, and eventually
that of Cafiel, has been attended, with great
Uaughter on both fides. The object of this effort
has not, indeed, been completely attained, but
the French are not To much straitened as they
were before in their quarters. 1 heir advanced
post being now in poflciHon of the lame ground
that was formerly occupied by .their invaders.
On the northern and eaftcrp frontier the
French arms have likewise made a fuccefsful
/ally ; they })avÂ« seized and plundered the town
of Furnek, and beat JÂ»ck the Austrian and Ha
noverian troops to Gftend. In a word, the
French, from the vivacity of ; thai t ipiric with
which they are aAuatÂ«;d, and their refuurces
and numbers, if they fuffer difaaer and iofa in
one piacL*, gain advantages in another.
On the other fide, the fptrit of their oppo
nents, the confederated armies, is equally per"
fevering, and their refonrces as abundant. From
ENGLAND
they have received at the port of Oftend the
rood fe-afoi bit and encouraging supplies of
troop>, animanirion, arms and proviiion. Ia

seem to be on the increase; whitethefpirit With

more widely difFufed; of which we haVe a tcin

THREE FRENCH. SHIPS OF WAR
to the governor of the Spanifti Island of St. Tri
nadad. If there be any truth in the report that
an army is on the point of being sent the aid
of the Bretons, from the Empress of Russia, the"
spirit of loyahy will -blaze forth in France wiilf
ilfll greater rapidity. i
- But whatever truth there may be In Ehii im
port the cause (if moderattt<Tmonarchy in Ffante
will doubtlffs derive no fmali countenance apd
support from the Britifti fleet that has failed ijn
der

into the Mediterranean, the probable ol>je& of
which is the reduction ojf iQorfica. That the
importance of this iiland to Great-Britain may
be rightly understood, it is to lie observed, that
with the-capital and industry of JBrltjlh mer
chants and planters, it is capable of producing
"as much coffee, cotton, silk and oil, as this coun
try consumes; & that it is already stored with as
much wood as would go a great way towards
maintaining the Britilh fleet for more than half
a century. Here it is natural to recoiled that
another island, producing cotton, coffee, See.
has been lately restored UÂ» the Britilh empire.
It is needless to remind our readers that weal
lude to the capture of the iiland ofj w
TOBAGO
in the Weft-Indies. While new fields are thus
opened to Britiih enterprize and cultivation j it
would certaiply be ra(h and impolitic to indulge
top,great a spirit of fpcculation on the fubje& of
a nun mediate and totai abolitiou of slavery. Â»
In the course of this week the part that
AMERICA
is to take on the present theatre of politic* has
been ai'certained; Ihe is, very prudently, to ob-
|-ferue au â¬xa& neutrality.
The formation and embodying of a militia,

as an obje& of diflikej and a fubjedt of cord

the fame spirit of loyalty appeared that has beer
strikingly manifeftedamong all ranks of Britift;
