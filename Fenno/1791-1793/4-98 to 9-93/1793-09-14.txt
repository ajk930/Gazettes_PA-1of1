FOR TJHF GAZHTTE.
HELVIDIUSâ No. IV.
THE last papers conjoleated the view pro
posed to be taken of the &YÂ£\iments in
support of the new and aspiring doctrine,
which ascribes to the executive the preroga
tive of judging aiid deciding whether there
be caules of war or not, in the obligatipfH of
treaties; notwithftand'ng the expi-eis provi.
lion in the constitution, by which the legiflu
tui*e is made the organ of the national will,
on questions whether there be or be not a
caiiie for declaring war. If the answer to
th*le arguments has imparted the convi&ion
which dictated it, the leader will have pro
nounced, that they are generally fuperficialj
abounding in contradictions, never in the .least
degree conclufrve to the mafn point, and hot
conclusive against writer
himfelf: whilfl: the doctrineâ-that The'powers
of treaty and war, are in their nature exe
cutive powersâwhich forms the basis of those
arguments, is as indefenfible and as danger
ous, as the particular do&rine to which they
are applied.
But it i&noA to be fotjLPtten that these doc,
trines, though ever so clearly disproved, or
ever lo weakly defended, remain before the
""public a ft: iking monument of the principles
and views which are entertained and propa?
gated in the community.
It is also to be remembered, that however
the consequences flowing from such premises.
may be riilavowed at this time or by this in
dividual, we are t6 regard it as morally cer
tain, chat in proportion as the do&rincs make
their way into the creed of the government,
and the acquiescence of the public,every pow
er that can be deduced from them, will be de
duced and exercised sooner or later by tkofe
who may have an interest in so doing. The
â¢character of human nature giver this falufary
warning to every sober and refie&ing mind.
And the history of government, in all its
forms and in every period of time, ratifies the
danger. A people therefore, who are so hap
py as to poiTefs the rneftimable bleflTng of a
free and defined conilitution, cannot lie too
watchful against the introduction, nor too cri
tical in tracing the consequences, of new
principles and new conitru*tions, that may re
move t >Ht la lid nrtrrks of f.
Should the prerogative which has, been exa
mined, be allowed in its molt limited sense, to?
usurp the public countenance, the interval
would probably be very {hort, before it would
be heard from some quarter or other, that the
prerogative either amounts to nothing, or
means a right to judge and conclude that the
obligations of treaty impose war, as well as
that they permit peace. That it is fair rea
soning, to fay, that if the prerogative exists
at all, an operative rather than ail inert charac
ter ought to be given to it.
lii support of this conclusion, there would
be enough to echo, 44 tl)at the prerogative in
this adtivs sense, is conoe<sted with the execu
tive in various capacitiesâas the organ of
intercourse between the nation and foreign
nationsâas the interpreter of national trea
ties" (a violation of which may be a cause of
â war) uas that power which js charged with
the execution of the laws of which treaties
make a partâas that power, which is charg
ed with the command and application of the public
Jorcc
With additional force, it might he laid, that
the executive is as much the executor ai the
iÂ»t:rpreter of treaties: that if by virtue of
theJirJi chara&er it is to judge of the obliga
. tions of treaties, it is by virtue of the fecond>
equally authorised to carry tho.'e obligations
into, ejfecl. Sliould there occur for example, a
* a J~u> Jcderis x claiming a military co-operation
Â©t the United States, and a military for.ee
(hould happen to be under the command of
executive, it must have the fame right,
as executw of public treaties tr> employ the public
Â£Â»' ce, as it has in quality of interpreter of pub.
he treaties to decide whether it ought to be cm.
ployed.
The cafe of a treaty of peace would be an
auxiliary to comments of this fort. I ; t is a
â condition annexed to every treaty that an
anfra&ion even of an important article, on
Â°ne fide extinguishes the obligations on the
other: and the immediate consequence of a
dissolution of a treaty of peace is a restora
tion of a (tare of war. If the executive is "to
decide on the obligation of the nation with
regard to foreign rations"â- 4i to p von ounce
the txijling condition (in the sense annexed by
tlie writci} of the nation with regard to
them ; and to admonilh the citizens of their
'obligations and duties as founded upon that
condition of things"â" to judge what are the
reciprocal rioht* and obligations of the United
-States, and of ali and each of the powers at
Tvar â¢' âadd, that if the executive moreover
Jfc)fTei7es all powers relating to war vctJlr 'tQly
within the power to dcciarc mar, which any pu
p*l of political casuistry, could diftinguifti
from, a raero xcUiffe into a war, that hedbttn
*tcbined r With this {lore of materials and the
example j*iven of the use to be made of them,
"would it be difficult to fabricate a power in
the executive ;o phmjre the nation into war,
Saturday, September 14, 1795.
wherever .1 treaty of peace might happen to
be infringed ?
But if any tl flicnlty fliouTfl a,rife, there is
another mode charked put by which the end
might clearly he brought about, even without
the violation o>f the treaty of peace ; especi
ally if t,he other party should* happep to change
its governmeju at the crisis. The executive,
in that cale, could ftfpcnd the treaty of peace
by rrfufnig to receive an aribajj'idu r si oni the >iitr
government, and the State of war civ?+#> \f
courfc.
This is a fampleof the ijfe to which the
extraordinary publication we are reviewini,
might be turned. Some of the inferences
could not be repelled at all. And the teaft
regulav of them must go Imoothly down with
those, who h:d fXvallowed the gwfs sophistry
~ which wrapped up t-he original dole.
view t!>at Gan be taken of this
fubjeft, adin->n.iflies the public, of the i.eccf
fity of a rigid adherence to the tfinple, tlie re
ceived and the fundamental dodtrini? of the
confti tat ion, that the power to declare war
including the power of judging of rhe icauffes
of war isjuliy a-nd xxcfufneh vested in the le
giflatufe : tbar the. pjcet utive has no right, in
any cafe to decide the q.ieftion, whether there
is or is not cause for declaring war : that the
right of informing 'ConfrreT';,
whenever such a q\reflion seems to call for a
decision, is all the /ightwhich the corftitution
has deemed requisite or proper â¢ and that for
such more than for any other contingency,
this right was fpecialiy <>;iven to the execu
tive.
In no part of the eotiflifusion is more wis
dom to be found than in the clause which con
hdqs the que ft iÂ«n of war or peace to the le
giflatuie, and pot to the executive depart
ment. Beside the objection to such, a fixture
of heterogeneous powers : the trust and the
temptation would t e too great for any one
man : not such as nature may offer as the
prodigy of many centuries, but such as may
be expe&ed jn the ordinary fiicc</fions of ma
gi ftracy, \V#r is in fact the true uurfe of
executive ag: audizement. In war a plfyifTcal
force is to'be created, and it is the executive
will which is to d'we-ft it. In war the public
treasures. are to be unlocked, and it is the ex
ecutive-band whic':. i.s to difptijfe them. . In
war the honors and .emoluments of office are
to be multiplied ; and it is the executive pa
tronage under which they are to be enjoyed.
It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be*ga|
theied, and it is the executive brow they
to enxircle. The flji ongbfl: paflions, and mcft
dangerous weaknefTes of the human breast ;
avarice, vanity, the honorable or
venial love of lame, aie all in confpiracy'a
gainft the desire and duty of peace.
Hence it has grown into an axiom that the
executive is the department of power most
diftinguifhed'by its propensity to war : hence
it is the p raft ice of all dates, in proportion
as they aie free, to disarm this propertfity of
its influence.
As the bed p r aise then that can be pronoun
ced on an executive magiftrr.tr, is, that he
is the friend of* peace ; a praise that fifes in
its value, as there may be .Â» known capacity
to (hine in war: so it mull be one of the molt
sacred duties of a free people, to mark the
firlt omen in the society, of principles that
may ftimnlate the hopes of other magistrates
of another propensity, to intrude into qi:ef
tions on which its gratification depends. If
a free people lie a wife people alio, they will
not forget that the danger of surprise can
never be so great, as when the advocates for
the prerogative of war, can iheatlie it in a
symbol of peace.
The constitution has manifefted a fmiilar
prudence in refufing to the executive the Jole
power of making peace, The trust in this
instance also, would be too great for the wis
dom, and the temptations too ftroug.fnr the
virtue, of a fugle citizen. The principal
real'ons on which the constitution proceeded
in its regulation ot the power of treaties, in
cluding treaties of peace, are so aptly fur
nidled by the work alrecdy quoted more than
once, that I fliall borrow another comment
from that source.
"However proper or fafe it may be in a
; ovenuncnt where the executive magistrate
s an hereditary monarch to commit to h;m
tie entire power of making treaties, it wouM
>e utterly unfafe and improper to entrust that
lower to an elective magistrate of four years
Juration. It has been remarked upon ano
ther occasion, and the remark is ququeftinna
biv jufV, that an hereditary monarch, though
of'ei the onprefTor of his people, has person
ally too much at stake in the government to
be in aov material danger of being corniced
bv foreign powers. But that a man raised
frora the Ration of a private citizen to the rank
us chief magistrate, pol&tl'ed of but a mode
rate or slender fnitune, Â»nd looking forward
to a period not very remote, when he may
probably be obliged to return to the Hation
from which he was taken, might ftmetimes
be under temptations ta faerjficr hi* duty to
his interest, which it would require fnperla
tive virtue ro,wi,ihftand. Anavariciocs man
yiiglit be tcmyted lo betray ite intercuts ol
537
*}â¢>'.J t
the state to the acquisition of wealth. An
ambitious man might piake his own aggran
dizement, by the aid of* a foreign potver, the
price of his treachery to bis roKffitYip fit's.â
I he hiUorv of human condnft doe* not war
rant that exalted opinion of human virtue,
which would make it wife in a nation, to com
mit interests of-, fq delicate and ;\io,i?!tiitous a
kind as those which concern its mtcrcourfe with
the reft of the woÂ»M, to the fi',c difpoial of a
magtftrate, created and circnmftanced, as
would be a PrefuJent of the United States."
I Hull conclude this paper and this branch
of the (uhjeft, with two reflexions, which na
turally arise from this view of the Conftitn
tiojj.
The firft is, that as the pcrfonal interest of
t an hereditary monarch in the government, is
the only security against the temptation ihci
! dent: to a commitment of the delicate and
\ momentous interests of the nation which con
| cerri itr intercom f w.th the reft of the world,
to the disposal ofafmgle ma gift rate, it is a
plain consequence, that every addition that
may he made 10 the ycwV,agenpy arid influence
of'the Executive, in the iutercouefe of the Â«a
tf#n with foreign nations, is an increase of
the dangerous temptation to wh'ch an dcft 'tve
avc temporary magistrate is expoi'ed ; and an
argument andadvance towards the security af
forded by the per Tonal interefiis of'dnhereditary
magistrate.
Secondljv As the confiltution has not per
mitted the Executive finkfi to conclude ar
judge that peace oug'it to be made, it
be interred from that circuirftancfr alone,
that it never meant to-Â»iveit jtrrg/y,
to judge and co.nckufe' that war ought not to
be made. The trull would be precifcly iin.i
lar and equivalent in the two cases. The
right to fay that wir nfcght riot to go on,
would be no greater than the right to fay that
war ought to begin. Every danger of
error or corruption, incident to Juch a prerd
gative in one cafe* is incident to it in .the
other. If the Constitution therefore has
deemed it unfafe or improper in the one cafe,
it must be deemed equally so in the other
cafe. ' HELVIDIUS.

the Proclamation of the Prefidenc of

Sir,
1 RECEIVE with great fatisfac

citizens of New Haven, which were
tranfinitted to ine in your letter of
the 20th inft. and I can with truth
allure them, that to receive the ap
probation of my fellow citizens, I
consider as my greatest glo'ff, 'as to
deserve it will ever be by constant
study.
If the measures of government,
approved and supported by the vir
tuous citizens of the United States,
can secure to our country, in the
ptefent critical times, a continuance
of peace atid the enjoyment of its
attendant bleflings, <which we have
as it were but begun totalis, I shall
feel amply compensated for the ma

lately experienced on account of

The Judges of the Court of Com
mon Pleas, the Grand Jurors for
the County of York, and a respec
table meeting of the inhabitants of
the Borough and County, convened
at the Court-hoofe, to conlulc on
the propriety of giving to the pub
lic a mauifeitation of ilieir accord
ante with, and inoft cordial appro
bation of (lie advice ami injunctions
contained in the late Proclamation
of the Frefideut of the United States,
" exhorting the citizens of this
country to a Uriel neutrality to
wards the European belligerent
powers."
Resolved, Thar at this important
period, we hold fiience on the inte
resting quefliop of national peace or
war, to be a failure in our doty as
citizens, and that war in all instan
ces, ought by every due means to
be avoided, and that he who enter
tains a differentdoiftrine, isan ene.
my to human happiness.
That although we highly approve
the exertion of a great nation, in
the aflertion of their lights, yet we
cannot perceive that our interfer
ence in their favor, would promote
the cause of general libei ty.
That under this imp re IB on, we
would consider any other conduct
towards the powers tÂ»t war, than
what is neutral, as tending to injure
the interests of the Union at large,
and this State in an especial man
ner.
Resolved, That we hold the mod
scrupulous adherence to neutrality
of condutt, as a duty we owe to <iui -
selves and our country, and as the
soundest wil'doin, and the belt poli
cy of this nation.
Resolved, That we cannot but
think that the President of the Uni
ted States has, by his late Proclama
tion, (hewn himfelf, once more, the
friend of mankind, and the coun
sellor of his country's peace.
that we will by every poflihle ef
fort, give energy to his Proclama

Resolved, That the foregoing re
solutions be published.

A writer in a late Virginia paper, who ap

of patriotism on the pan of ihe people, in ihtir
public approbation of the measures purfutd by
the President of the United States, to prefeive
the peace of this country, propofct that meetings
of the people should be called, to coutlteraft
what Iras been clone by the people. Another
writer in anot-her quaiterluggefts the propriety
of the people's being silent while the fluicwof

''with the must iutemperate abnfe against their

g.mus from the fame mint, fays, that a declara
tion ill favor of the Pioclamation-of neutrality
is neccffarily connected with an avowal of fen
timentshoftiletoth. liberties of Fiance. When
such ideas are resorted to and held up as induce
ments to the people to despise their OWII go
vernment, the enemies of peace must be redu
ced to the most deplorable povctty of argu
ment.
The word idea that can be associated with
government to render it odious, arijiocracy, is
perpetually exhibited in the foreground of all
the declamations against the Conft'.tution and
government of the United States, II the peo

as the supine and pafTive dupes of arijiocracy
if they are roused by open and daring attacks on
their sovereignty, on the charaffcrs of their liee'y
defied civil rulers, and on the nieafures of their
government from which they derive the most
solid blessingsâis they presume under these cir
cumstances to express their indignation againfl
the dilturbers of their peace, and to fay that
their country is happyâhappy in the enjoyment
of the blessings of government laws and fiee
<jomâwe are told that such declarations are
produced by " the wild and savage appetite of
aristocracy."
Nothing is more evident than this, that the
inveterate enemies of the Constitution of the"
United Slates are enemies to all government
whateverâfor no government that can be seen,
felt, or underftuod, let its adm.mftration be
ever so salutary, can possibly escape the ccnfurc
of those who'cenfure the people for fupportmg Â«

for expressing the homft feelings of their hearts,
when they are happy.
In all revolutions of government, it so hap

WERE we (fays a correspondent) to hazard
an opinion on the politics of Philadelphia, by
papers publiftied in that city, the inference
would be, that, in one instance excepted,
there is not the fmallefl difference between
the Jacobin 1 ; of Philadelphia and thole of Paris.
It is true they have committed no murders
or horrjd acts of cruelty (the pride and glory
of the French Jacobins) but how often have
t]iey attempted to blast and murder the cha
racter of our beloved President : And for
, Because lie would not 1 offer a let of
desperadoes, the rubbish of all nation*, to in
volve the United States in a war, by arming
and fitting out velfels in our portsâbecause
lie would not raise an immense army, to drive
Governor Simcoe and a handful of Britifli
troops from the western in
Â»Ihoi t, he would not bring all the horrors of
war on his country, to fatisfy the views of a
few discontented, factious individuals. Those
who give implicit belief to the torrent of
abuses daily poured out against him, ought
difpaflionately to refledl on his past services.
They ought to knowâthey ought to be well
assured, that the man, who under divine Pro
vidence snatched his country from slavery,
will not be instrumental in its deftru&ion.â
Since the unanimous voice of bis fellow-citi
zens called him into public life, his character
has flood unsullied ; nor is it in the power of
anonymous revilers to tarnilh it, whilftone
spark of liberty remains unextinguiftied in
the breast of an American.

own consequence increasesâHe hugs
himfelf in the belief that as he can
wound, he is considered as formida
ble. The lafl knowledge perhaps
that such a man acquires, is the
know ledge of himfelf. In his vain
aÂ«d felfilh indulgence, lie flatters
himfelf into the idea that he under
stands inoft fobj;<fts well enough to
write 011 them with force and acute
nefsâWere such a man nfked whe
ther he had devoted himfelf to the
bell authorsâand digested their
learning by reflectionâWhether he
had long endeavored to cleanse his
own mindâto letftify its defectsâ
to ameliorate his iitfeiSions, and to
gain that philosophical tranquility
which is so neceflary to the difcern
nient of abftritfe truthâhis conver
sation and his habits of life would
answer for him, if lie had not ho
nesty enough to tell youâNo, he
has not studied long or well. An
intimate knowledge of all that
others have laboriously investigated
would have inspired him with mo
destyâ He would learn in the revo
lution of opinions, for ages, a diffi
dence of his ownâand lie would
amiably be disposed to caution, and
to repress his contempt for the opi
nions of others. A rectitude of un
derltanding, had he cultivated it,
would have corrected that reltlefs
vanity and disposition to obtt ufion
which mark a hade to write or to
speak dogmatically ; and had he
obtained t ranqtiility of mind, t bings
would appear in their true shapes,
and his discerning faculties would
have been invigorated. Under this
temper, a thouf'and things that spur
on the vain and the foolilh into er
ror and heat, would appear unim
portant and unworthy enquiry.
111 ihe country, men cei tainly
think with more correct ness, and
pofiels a more vigorous fiiare of
common feufe, than in crowded ci
tiesâin them the (ciences generally
flourtfh moil â but the moral and po
litical qualities of men and of go
vernment, are perhaps bed felt at;d
11 tidied in the countiy, than amidst
the great mass of the people
Large commercial cities cSm Icarce
ly be claiied as of any one nation in
particularâthey are generally com
posed of people from a great many
nations â such are Philadelphia, N.
if oik, &c.âThere foreigners easily
obtain a footing and are caressedâ
Scarcely are they warmed into l'up
plenefs by the genial climate of
freedom, but they feel a difpofuion
to meddle with the concerns of go
vernment â They find their impor
tance increased (in their own ima
gination) by an alliance with foine
faction which they may happen to
find ; and fnch is the mifcrnble ma
lignity of faction, that, like a gan
grene, it allimilates every thing
within its sphere to its own putrid
characterâlt eagerly embraces any
man of any country, or itny cha
racter who will inlift in its lie ws.
The liberty of the press is the sacred
right of the citizens of this country
âIt is a high and most iiluftrious
privilege which 110 man who is not
a citizen is here intitled to. Per
mit foreigners to use and to abuse
this privilege, and the sober part of
the community at a distance, who
cannot pofiibly know the writer,
may and will be exposed to the ma
chinations of foreign emillaries
Such foreigners (and 110 citizen can
be a foreigner) and temporary refi
dents, ought to remember that a
free anil wile nation have lung fmce
given us an example in pointâwe
I'-Â»ve foccelsfully imitated if.Â» Aihe
nians in the glotious pmiuit of li
bertyâ and I'urpaliod them. We
may perhaps feel jultiiied iu reviv
ing foment their laws, if forcigttu?
ca]! thefirfl flout. Tbe citizens of
this country ought to be too proud
of their country and its govern
ment, to bear with patience the
meddling obti ufivenels of any man
w'ho has not the honour of being a
citizen of the United States. The
French and Knglifh writers at Phi
ladelphia mitfl be quietâand not
attempt to dill tub the peace of this
happy country.
