[CONCLUDSD FROM OUR LAST.J
WHILE we exult in the success of reason
and juiliceâwh'le we rejoice in the re
cent vi&ory ol energetic principles ovej chime
rical and republican fjmpiicity, it
ii duty so to conlider the past, aa lo pioiit 111
what is 10 come. In this view, I lhal) make
foine obfcÂ» vauons, as what dirtttly flow irom
idte CongrefTiouai occurrences.
1 hope the members ot Cougrefs will now he
taught to be moie cauunus how they alarm their
country, and blame the faith! ul and molt ufetul
fi'ivantt ol the public. We thould all have an
eye on the conduct of pubi c men; and mem
bcis of more than any others, aire
called to this duty : they are ccmintls on she
walls ot the republic, and should immediauly
give notice of approaching danger. But let it
be rcmcmUcicd, thai if (ihu' ikÂ«' mere roiftake).

they call fri< nns fOcs, arra muk the very
pillais of she tj-Â»tc as lecirr cori'pi' >rs agamll
it, they may Â»oon iuvolvc us in anarchy and
ruin.
Again, the pro pie ought ro I alee up no rcpoit*
or iccufanohs as eilablifhed truths. They ought
to immediately examine every iuggeftion Â«ul de
linquency in iheir fcrvants ; hut till (key airive
at the issue of iliat exaininai ion, they ought rjot
to condemnânot even to fufpeift. One
suppose ihc flaming patriots of Congress knew
from whence have drawn their knowledge
of governmental corruptions âone would sup
pose that before they mfe to atcufe public func
tionaries, they knew of a certainty that their ac
cusations were true. Yet we have icen the con
trary. While therefore we arc carcful to give
full credit and applavife to thofc who, through
youthful ardor, are bold in attacking every ap
pearance of a plot against our liberties âlet us
not pi ecipitately join in every hue and ci y against
government, its measures and iis officers ; but
let us examine for ourselves, and when we arc
convinced, then lei us condcmn. Too many
think there is no need of cauuon here; Â»hcy
think the only danger is, that the people will be
too lupine, will be too indiffeicm to .the dan
gerous rticafuies of their ft rvants. Honce
talk of jealouly, as a tnoft efTencial republican
virtueâHence loiflc tell me, ihev take a certain
Ga?.ette ; not because they reiifh the abuf" it
teems with, but because it serves as a good pur
gative to the coirupt humours necejjarily giiihr/-
ing, from time to time, in the oody politic.
For my part, I explode tljrfe notions, not only
as infamoufly (illy, but as aflually pernicious to
the public good. Why flbould we make it a
virtue to do that to a public ch.ira&er, y/hich if
done to a private, would make us worthy to be
cropped ? This jealousy, with too many, is but
another name for inj*iflice and abufc. I think
I would help to hunt our of the land every aris
tocrat, every convi&cd enemv to the l>appinrfs
of others. But, for all this, I would not call 4
man one, and pei fecute him as such, be cause he
is in office apd I am out, because he is tich and
J am poor, because his political principles and
mode of promoting the general welfare arc dif
ferent from mineâbecause I am nobody*) and
he is Secretary of the Treasury.
This conduct, this extravagant jealousy, I pro
nounce pernicious; and, nfmga lalhionable de
mocratic phrase, I denounce it to a difccin iitf
piioltc. Men of grmus. cultivated tatents and
integrity* are men of generous and exquifi'e feel
ings. By that abuse, which too many deem a
virtuous republican jealousy, these chara&ers will
be thrust out ol office, that men may take ih. ir
places, who at gaming tables and brothels have
loft the fear of their Cieator, the Jove of o;hcrs,
and that delicious fenfibilitv yhjch ever arcont
pamcs an upright and a poliflied mind. Hard
ened bv vice, the laiter can bear without emo
tion, that abuse they once so ficcly bellowed on
better men.
Who can eflimate the loss of men, such as
Mr. Hamilton appeaisto be? It is immonfe.
Great capacity, much cultivation, not a mere
Chaotic map of ciimbeffome erudition, but
wholesome fyttrmatic knowledge, almost un
equalled diligence and labour, iound integrity
and diftingnifhed patriotism, are united in him.
Drive, by rash accusations and abuse,
such as he is, Irom the helm, and we fh.ill soon
founacr or be wrecked, amidst those storms, to
which every government is more or less cxÂ«
posed.
The lots of nvn uncommonly qualified in
head and heart, 10 promote the public wcaj, is
not the only ill effect of an uncorretted jealousy
in the pcoplr. It will difpoCe them e er to give
their con6dencc to those that oppose govern
ment, whatever be their principles or their mo
rals. 1 hus the vi 1 ell men will at times be exalt
ed. The people will fofter vipers in their bo
som, who, in return, will fling them to death.
A -variety of contradi&ory measures will be pur
(tied. The government will wan? fyft. m and
liabilityâit will lose the public confidence, it
will timet*âit may fall. Nay more, such ex.
treme jealousy, pulfiing us, on the one haiui*
to unjutt treatment of men in officeâand on the
other, lo the heaping ol applause upon men out
of office, is the frequent forerunner, and with
ourftlves may one day oe the caufc of thi,t mo
narchic or auftocratic tyranny we now so hear
tily execrate. Tho' 1 accustom rayfHf to hope
for the best, tho* I admire Dr. Fia ixim,
and daijy find lite fwecter by looking at the
liandtome leg, yet reason and compel me
to dread, left treacherous and tyrannic Croni-v

nrtnt, v\hicr>, under a gracious providence, ha*

coveis us with honou r .
My pall obfeivauons arc general. I now
close with one more particular. It is, that the
late proceedings m Congress Jhould endear the
Secrciaty ol tlie Treafuiy to every virtuous Ame
rican. He tÂ» one of the brightest j ; weli In Co
lumbia's crown. As a pilla, in the federal
building, he ieems to unite the lolidity ot th;
Done order, ilje delicacy and of ;ti=
lon'c, aud the touching beauty oJ.tr,i? Corin hian.
Here yon fee I inoulgrjnylelf. Not t h,i we are
known to each otherâl never was of his ac.
and uever experttÂ®. beâ nor de Iknow any thing more of Hi* private character,
than that hit morals are good, and his foul truly
honorable and honed. I view him only as a
public man. Remote fiom public (cenef, devoid
of ambition, with but little, yet witnout a want,
my life passes fwpetly, sometimes rru>ft delici
01.fly in the alienate exercifes'of Audy, recrea
ton and domestic endearments. This declara
tion is due to thole who fee how high the Secre
tary tÂ» in mv esteem. So miich ot me, it may
be well to know, that if may be seen, that not
only thofc under the influence of government,
but many who derive nodircft emolument from
itânot only the satellites around the throne, our
visionaries have themselves created, and now
â¢with noble patrioiiftn attack âbut multitudes
in every pars of the Union do greatly admire
and will Arenuoufly support Our unparalleled
constitution' and Our virtuous administration.â
No, Mr. Fenno, it is not by the minions of power
â¢nly, as they have been maliciously ftiled, that
administration is approved. Such an inlidious
and unjust refle&ion has at length overcome my
pait relu&ance, and has induced one to publish
his fentimenis, whose situation in life would, if
known, be a faiire upon the suggestion of his
being dircflly benefited by, or conne&ed wiih
government. Bent filed by it we all areâsos it
is the fountain of our political comfort: con
t.cfled we all are, with it, as the body and limbs
are conneffed with the head.
Chiefly a love to others, a defuc to make fomc
return amidst too much popular ingratitude to
those who are waiting their strength for me and
my children, together with at
the imprudence, if nothing worse, in some pub
lic characters, have excited me to transmit my
thoughts to you for publication; and I verily
believe, tho' I sometimes meet with the jealous
and wilh fomr who call your's a ministerial
paper, the great majority of the people will join
me in what I am now uttering, and do coincide
with the current sentiments of your Gazette.â
The enemies of our peace would have their af
feitions disproved, would be overwhelmed with
a jtjft indignation, if the thinking and upright
part of thÂ« community, at a diflance from, as
well aÂ« at the featof goveriimont, wÂ«re to publish,
as I now do, their sentiments and their feelings
refpeCling our public men and their measures.
I judge of the Secretary from a careful perusal
of his official productions, and a careful attention
to his official condutt. The prefent,l deem an
important asra ; and while I leave a Gâs to that
praise and gratitude which some may halten to
give him, I would strive to bripg my fellow,
citizens to a just appreciation of the merit of
Mr. Hamilton âof that merit which the late
accusations have made not merely conspicuous,
but truly resplendent Let then confidence in
him be henceforth unshaken ; and let the federal
measures, of which he is the reputed auihor, be
hencefoith considered as largely partaking of his
â wildom, energy, order and ufefulncfs.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 5
The intelligence of the execution
of Louis XVI. has been received
here wiih aftoniflinient and horror.
It has occaiioued a violent fermen
tation in the army ; and desertions
begin to be very considerable in
consequence of the King's death.
This unfortunate event is likewise
the fubjedl of animosity and quar
rel throughout the armyâseveral
affrays have taken place ainongfl:
the military, in which some have
been killed and wounded.
LONDON, Feb. 18.
The elctSors of Liege,to the num
ber 9,700, were aflembled on the
28th of January, to determine upon
their union with the French repub
lic, when their new attachment
proclaimed throughout the city by
the found of a trumpet.
The Duke of Brunfwick is resolv
ed to make every attempt to efface
the stain cafl upon his character as
a General. The King of Pruflia has
the fame intention. He goes along
the ranks of his soldiers, addrefles
all the companies, and endeavors
to encourage them whom he calls
the companions of the Great Frede
ric. " Shall these men (fays he)
who were accuft'omed to conquer,
return with ignominy. Shall the
succeeding year pass over without
gaining any advantage to honor
your bravery ; and fhalj ye. again
retire without collecting one sprig,
of laurel ? Soldiers ! fuffer not Eu
rope to forget that you are PruffiÂ»
ans."
The spirit of loyalty has been so
much kept up in Wilt/hire, that ire
a little village not five miles from
Devizes, the Fidler was burnt in
effigy becaofc he would not play
" God save the King," at the burn
ing of Tom Paine,
The language of the King of Pruf
lia is insulting in the extreme, as he
informs the Poles, " That he ch'e
rilhes a hope from his pacific mea
sures, that his troops will meet with
a favorable reception."âHow ami
ably pacific, when he means to in
vade and enslave the country ! if
England goes to war for the Bog,
to preserve the balance of power,
what will Die not do, when a whole
country is seized by two despots ?
Petitions from every borough in
Irelan.d are received by the Irilh
parliament, praying for a more e
qual representation in parliament.
These are received with a degree

As a proof of the flourifhing state
of the Botany-Bay colony, a letter
has been publiftied in several pa

no corn ; palturage in abundance,
but no cattle ; and that the climate
is wholefume, but the people jickly.
A gentleman in office, beingi ask

The late alarm at Paris, cf an at
tempt to renew the horrors of the

by a crowd of idle people, in the

to fee the execution of a man con
demned for forging aflignats.
A woman,callingherfelf the nurse
of the late king's daghter, lent a let
ter to the commons, praying admis
sion to fee her fofter child, and of
fering to remain confined in the
temple with her as long as tbey
fliould think fit. The commons
palled to the order of the day, on
the ground that the person in whose
name the letter was written was
not known to them.
Ic is somewhat Angular, that one
of the most strenuous oppofeis of a
general repeal of the laws against
the Roman Catholics of Ireland,
ihould be the lord chancellor (bitz

His father was a Roman Catholic,
but conformed, that he might be
qualified to pratfi'ce the profefiion
of the law.
Many, indeed moftof our modern
writers on political fubjedis, might
with great propriety adopt the lol
lowing motto from Smithfon's ami
ablenefs of candor and diffidence :
" Though I have examined what
all other authors have written on
this affair with great impartiality,
yet I cannot eonceive that any of
them have the lead merit ; nor do
I find one man that has treated the
fubjeift sensibly, except jnyfelf."
1 hat deservedly popular air,' God
save the King,' was composed in the
reign of George I. by Mr. Carey :
and it obviously applies to a warri
or and a patriot Sovereign. When
firft sung, some parts of it were not
understood exactly in the fenfethat
they are at present. Thus, ' con
found their politics,' alluded to the
politics of the pretender and the
adherents of the Stuarts, as support
ed by the despots of France.âWe
need (carcely mention, that these
were divine, indefeafible rights of
Kings, the sacred inviolability of
their persons, paflive obedience,
non-resistance, &c. with other ex
ploded dotSrines, which would hard
ly be admitted even at the Crown

Portrait of PHILIP EGALITE,
Ci-devajit Dukt of Orleans.
His whole life has been the scan
dal of his age, a swindler and de
bauchee in his youth, he eorrupted
and destroyed the Prince de Lani
balle, hisbrother-in-law,with a view
afterwards to accuse, allaflinate, and
plunder the Princefs,his wife,whom
he stripped of an iminenfe fortune,
and reduced to poverty.
He carries in his bosom the pesti
lential germe of corruption ; and
after dishonoring his own bed, he
dishonors that of another, and blasts
what little remained of the family
of the celebrated BufFon, whose
daughter he made the instrument
of his debauchery.
Proprietor of that celebrated gal
lery of pictures, collected at a vast
expence by his anceltors, who were
an honor to France,he has mutilated
and dispersed those chef d'oeuvres
of art, whose value he had not the
talents to appieciate.
If he was ever in battle, it was
when he hid himfelf upon the ap
pearance of the enemy's colours,
and acquired the ironical surname
of l'Heros d'Ouellant. If he parti
cipated in the crimes of the Revo
lution it was to fly before la Fay
ette, and demonstrate that he was
equally the scoundrel and the vil
lain. If he made an effort to build
the Palace Royale, it was to plunge
thousands of families in despair,
who had the credulity to entrust
him with their property, which was
swallowed up in that fraudulent
bankruptcy, which he committed
with the mod cynical impudence.
f hefc ueafures and his fortune
have been employed to pay the
crimes of the sth of October, the
ioih of August, the 2d of Septem
ber, and the 21 It of January. Thus
has Heaven been lavjfli of its favors,
only to lender vice more conspicu
ous. He was educated in dignity,
that his villainy nnght be more pro'
minent ; he was 1 irh and powerful,
oÂ«ly that his vires might be more
numerous and d-fpifed ; he was fla
tioned lu-ar the ! hrone, onl\ to
overturn ii ni n,o.e public dis
grace, and ,ff er a ten ible lef
-1011 to natic Â« :jd to kings.
His friends and hi<t agents were
homogenial with himfelf, La Cl 0Â«
the author of the immoral romance'
called Les Saifons Dangereufes â 
âGenlis Sillery, a man the mo st
deeply perverted in iniquity of any
other of the present age, and the
hero of the annals of debauchery
figured away in his councils, iucoiw
junction with that execrable mou
(ter and atl.eiftical priest, who at
the end of the 18th century jjf.
graces the name of Perigord. Adj
to these, we may reckon thatgrace
lef's wretch La Toitche, and Biron
enlarged from an EÂ»gli(h prison.to
appear at the head of the armies of
the Revolution.
Such were the worthy colleague*
of Philip Egaliie ; I'uch were his
coadjutors in that series of guilt,
which wanted only to be completed'
by calling to his ailiftance Le Gen
dre, the butcher, and the nephew
of Damien, Roberfpieri e, and the
nialefadiors of every country. Such
were his secretaries, his dire&ors,
his Chancellors, his familiars, and
his bofoni friends ! ! !

CHARLESTON, April 9.
Yesterday morning the French
frigate, l'Enibul'cade, commanded
by citizen BbnVpart", mounting 36
guns, and manned with 30* Teamen,
appeared off our bar ; where Ihe
came to anchor.
L'Embufcade had a passage of for
ty-two clays from Rochfort.
This veH'el was dispatched by the
French Republic with M. Geneft,
Ambaflador from the Executive
Council of that nation to the Piefi
dent and Congress of the United
States of America.
April 10. Yetlerday commodore
Gillon entertained M. Geneft, the
French Ambafl'ador, with his suite,
the officers of l'Embufcade, and a
j)umber of French citizens, at his
house in this city.
The French frigate I'Embnfcade
took one prize on her partage from
France, namely, the brig Sally,from
JQova Scoria to Barbadoes. The
capture W3S made near Bermuda,
but the prize has not yet arrived.
We arc informed, that a detach
ment of Britilh troops, amounting
to oÃe hundred men, have just at -
rived at Bermuda, aÂ»id that an ad
ditional reinforcement is expedited
thereâas an attack from a trench
squadron wasfei ioufly apprehended.
Monf. Genelt has favored us with
the following important intelli
gence, viz. That the National con
vention, considering that timber, of
the growth of the United States,
proper for the building of tliips, is
equal to any in the world, have
lately'parted a decree, revoking, in
favor of the United States, all the
laws which heretofore have exilled
in that country, with regard to the
sale of foreign bottoms within the
French ports ; so that American
built vell'els sent thither, for (:ile,
will in all probability meet with a
very good market.
April 13. We understand, that
bis Excellency the Governor has giv

NATURAL CURlObll Y.
Extratt of a Utter from a gentleman living in the
county of Otfego, New-York, to his jritnd in this
county.
u I was separate a few rods from my bro
ther huntsmen, on the southeast fide of Scho
hary mountain, which lies in the county oi
Otfego, in the pursuit of game, on the 15th of
December last. As I was walking through a
thicket of oak buthes, where there was but
little snow on the ground, I unexpe<stedly
found myfelf falling into the earth. I drop
ped my gun and endeavoured to save mylelf
with my hands, but to no purpose. I went
down a distance upwards of 63 feet, as was
afterwards ascertained by measuring, without !
receiving any material injury, except bruiling j
my elbows and thighs a little. I found myfelf
in a cave upwards of 42 paces long, and about
20 wide. It was by mere accident my com
panions dilcovered me; as all the noile I was
capable of making, could not be heard at the
distance of a rod from the mouth of the ca
vity. My companions threw down one end
of a rope to meâby making myfelf fact to It,
I was, after much difficulty, drawn from the
gioomy mansion. By the fame rope the three
men who were with me, were let down, by
turn, to view the cave. It was as smooth
inside, as if it had been worked out by a ftone
cutter âand at one corner there was a small
spring of genuine cold sweet water, which
gently empties itfelf out at the opposite cor
ner. It is evident that some persons had been
so unfortunate as to fall into this cave, and
for want of afliftance, perish in itâas we
found a number of human bones on the bot
tom of the cave. The phi/ofophic mind may
here find ample employment in tracing out
the original cause of a curiosity like tjie pre
sent. I think it exceeds every curiosity
j which I ever was fpe&ator of, 111 the course
I of my life."

ed that a general attack is meditated by the
Pruflian and Auilrian troops, who have block
aded thu city for the lalt two months. But a
circumstance of the most fatal afpeft to the

was read in Convention on Tuesday the 12th,
which ihews, that the National Gendarmes of

Chriftiar. Majesty, Louis the XVI. King ot
France, who finifhed his career on the 2ill of
January, with a heroism equal to his hard
misfortune, and to the inhumanity of the hor
rid and unheard of outrages committed a
gainst his august person."
London, Feb. It. Though France has not
expressly declared war against Ruflia, hosti
lities are not the less open ; for the circular
letter of the minister of marine, sent to all
the ports, carries an order to lay an embar
go on all Ruffian vessels as well as others, and
this order has been executed in the port ot
Bourdeaux.
Before the ill of March, the emperor and
and the king of Prutlia, will have on foot
340.000 men, all distributed in different polls
to ast against France.
Feb. 23. We are glad to find that the fai

feeo papers to the 25th of February. Spain
has. declared war, and 3P TaiJ of the line were
expe&ed to join the British and Dutch fleet,
about the beginning of this month. It was
said that all the veirels fitted out by France,
as privateers, were taken as tliey appeared
in the seas. We had a report that the queen
of France, was tried, condemned and execu
ted ; however, this seems premature, and
without foundation."
Captain Art, arrived last Saturday from
Chariefton, was informed that the French
had declared war against Ruflia. The frigate
L'Embnfcade, after landing the Ambailador,
Monf. Qeneft, continued opposite the bar for
tWb Â«t"tVee # *day*, and then disappeared.-*-
As the Delaware came out, the 1 ith instant,
(he spoke a British brig from Halifax going
into Chariefton, who informed Capt. Art that
ftie was a prize to the, French frigate.
The French AmbaiTador was to set out for
Philadelphia, it was reported, on the 9th, but
had not, however, departed, the day Capt.
Art failed ; but that he would a&ually set out
in a day or two, and his twe Secretaries
would lhortly embark in the brig Aurora,
Capt. Cross.
The Ambaflador's suite, -carriage and fur

Innumerable reports are fabricated, and
thrown into circulation at the present day.â
Among others, that Lord Dorchester is ap- j
appointed ambaflador to the United States;
another, that he is coining to Philadelphia to

pondents as miy be able to give jatisfaflory an~
fivers to the fame would be pleafea to fend them in

THE QUESTION.
SUPPOSE I ftiould be cast away upon fame
desolate iflarid, or Ihould travel into some
uncivilized country, where no kind of matheÂ®
matical instruments could be procured.âl want
to know what obfervacions I could make in
fujh circumstances, without the alliftance of any
other instruments, except a knife and hatchet,
or such as I cauld readily make with theseâso
as to enable me afterwards, with the afliftance of
proper books, to compute, with tolerable accu
racy, the latitude and longitude of the place
where I had made such observations.
N. B. It may be taken for granted that I
frail be able to preserve an cxa& register o* all
my observations, and of the year, monih, and
day when they were made; and that I know
the names of moll of the principal fixed stars,
or at least (hall be able to point out such on
which I (Via 11 have made any observation.
It is requested that your correspondents be
very minute and particular in the d>reÂ£lÂ»ons
they may give, so that they may be easily un
derstood, and readily put in practice.
It is also requested that you would publish all

The following character of the above work,
is given in the Review of the MaJJachvfetti Ma~
gazine, for Jan. 1793 :
44 This is a very ufeful work, and is no ill
proof of and induilry of the author.
The rules arc laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are luffiuent for their iJ
luftration. One part of the work doMtf P 4 '-
ticuUr commendation. We mean that which,
the author stiles " Mercantile Arithmetic." It
occupies a considerable portion of his book, but
not more than its importance will jnftify. We
would recommend to the young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to Litis branch.
He will find its principles well explained And
should he make himfelf master of them, he will
always have reason to acknowledge bis obliga
tion to the judicious and laborious author. Wo
cannot but congratulate tberifing generation or>
account of the many ufeful prod unions which
have lately appealed; and in which their im
provement lus been principally consulted.â
Among t.hofe productions we inufl place this
treatise of Arithmetic. We should be wanting
in justice to the author, should we not acknow
ledge that his work is in reality that which i'f
litle importsâThe Pr eceptor's Assistant,
