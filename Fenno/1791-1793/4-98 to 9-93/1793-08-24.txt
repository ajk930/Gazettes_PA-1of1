TO TilE PEOPLE.
HAVE the Americans a right to go a pri
vateering agamft any nation, w-hile Ame
rica is at peace wife all the world ? That
they have 110 fiich right is declared by the
President ; and the fudges of the supreme
court are d.robtlefs of the tame opinion. Kut
tlie-e is party in some of the States who sup
port an opposite opinion. They contend that
art American citizen may when he p eufies en
ter 011 board a foreign privateer while the
United States 1 afe at peace. When we con-
Jider the conduct of this party in Philadelphia
during the late trial of a privateer's-nun, the
proofs of joy they afterwards exhibited, and
the late publications that seem Xb have been
made by some of them, indecent bevondd
their usual efforts; when we consider also that
the head of that party fcttnn to have appealed
to the people'm oppofjtion to the fenfe'of the
â¢executive, with the hope, as we mult Aippofe,
ofcauftog infurrettions and overturning the
government, it must be hig;h time for cvrrj
citizen to consider the fribjeft fully and fay
whether kw iÂ« for war or pesice.
Be not deluded my fellow-citizens by the
icW? parade of wordy lawyers or frothy poli
ticians, there is but one question before us.â
It is the question of War or Peaceâand the
true object of all the privateer Vmen is d ge
ruralWaj, whatever they may pretend to the
contrary, for their measures tend to inevita
ble war. You will be pleased to think on this
subject an(i give your opinions.
The argument used by the party in oppo
sition to government, I do nos know whe
ther they, are tifually called for the lake ot
<lUlm&ion, pi ivateer's-men or Geneteens, is
that a citizen of America, living in America,
may when he pleases change his allegiance,
that he may this minute be an American, and
on the next minute, without change of place,
he may, by a kind of hocus pocus or le&ev de
main, be a French, an or a Dutch
man. That being thus he
may Chip him lie If ou board the armed fliip of
Iris adopted foreign nation, he may go to. sea
and plunder or take the (hips of people with
Avhom the Americans are at peace, may
bring thole lhips iqt" American ports and
fell them a'; pood prizes. Le.t us trace the
natural conclulions from this argument.â ,
French privateers tliey fay may be fitted in !
American ports and American citizens may j
become Frenchmen in our towns. If part of
the crew of a French privateer may be Ame
ricans, nick named French, certainly the
Whole crew may be of the fame class. If one
man may purchase and fit out a vessel for
eruifing against the trade of a nation with
whom we are at peace, every other man .may
do the fame thing. Our ship owners may be
tranfrnufied into Freiichmen as well as ou/
teamen. In this cafe there may soon be fclty
rtr an hundred privateers at sea, cruizing
against ths trade of Spain, Holland, Jwvgland
aÂ«d Germany, mak'n&defcentsoo their iflinds
or their European dominions, aivd plundering
their ftibje&s. All tl*e prizes or plunder must
come into the United States for the accom
modation of the captors when they Iball think
fK again t<* call tbemfelces Americans. It
might so happen that not a finale man of afl
this privateering armada had ever been in
Franceâall of them birn in Amcrica and re
taining the privileges of American citizens ;
but the people of the United States are all
this time supposed to be inofferfive and peace
able ! Suppose any of the injured nations
should complain that Americans had taken
â their veflels and (hould demand reparation,
mirjfuhtile politicians are prepared with an an
swer jâwe are to reply that those Americans
had changed their country, while they were
cruizing, and we disowned them ? Would this,
do you think, be a fatisfaftory answer ? Old
Judiams make treaties of peace with us and
â¢young Indians kill our fellow-citizens ; when
we complain of the breach of peace, the blame
is conftantjy iaÂ»d, not upon people wbo ceafeÂ«d
to lie Indians, but upon di{orderlyyoung people;
the nation do not make themselves anfwera
b\e. The policy of out pi ivatter's-men is an
-improvement on savage perfidy ; their out
rages \rjll Â«urt be committed by aiforderiy peo
yle of the United States,but bv frendirrm who
<b<jd been Americans before they went oh
Jboard and will be Americans when they come
on fbore.
Suppose wc should declare war to-morrow
England, Spain and Holland, what is
to be done ; it is generally supposed that our
whole exertions must he confined to priva-
sgainfl their commerce, bat this is
the very th ner Â©ur politicians would eifeft by

FOR THE CAZFJTf. ,
Mr. Fen.no,
Please to give a place in your tfazeVt to the fo'low.
ing ohfervatioru The Printers xu'w may have re
publifked the piece*. Pacific us, are a/si
requeued to re-puhhjh theft, and wiU w doubt be
candid enough to do Jo.
O Â£VERAL pieces with t'te (igrfature of Pa-
O cific-js were lateJy puMi filed, whith have
"been read with (angular and applftufe,
by the foreigners and degenerate citizens a
mong us, who hate our republican govern
ment, and the ,French revolution; whilst the
publication seems to have been too little re
garded, or too mfcch despised by the steady
fVier.ds to both.
Had the do<Shines inculcated by the writer,
with the natural consequences from them,
been nakedly presented to the public, this
treatment might have been propei. Their
true character would then have (truck every
eye, and been rejectee! feelings of eve
ry heart. But they offer themselves to the rea
der in the drefsof an elaborate differtattan ;
they ate mingled with a few truths that may
serve them as a paflporr -to .credulity $ and
they are introduced with profeffions ol anxi
ety for the preservation of peace, for the
Welfare of the government, and for the re
fpeft due to the parent heÃd of the execu
rive, that may prove a snare to patriot!fin.
Ititbele difgut:fes they have eppeared to
claim tlie attention 1 propose to lieftow on
them; with a view to (hew, front the publi
cation itfelf, that under colour of vindicating
an important public act, of a chief magif
trnte, whoenjoys Hie confidence and love of
his country, principle 1 ! are advanced whirii
ftrilpe at the vitals of its constitution, as well
as at its honor and true interest.
As it is not improbable that attempts may
be made t<> apply inlinnations which are fel
doni spared when particular pnrpoles are to
be anfwercd, to the author of the ensuing Â»b
---fervation.Â», it may iÂ»t be improper to pre
mise, that he is a friend to the constitution,
that he withes for the preservation of peace,
and that the present chief magistrate has not
a fellow-citizen, who is penetrated with deep
er refpeft for his merits, or feels a purer so
ltcitude for his glory. '
This declaration is made with no view of
courting a more tavorable ear to what may be
said than it deserves. The I'ole purpo'e of
it is, to obviate imputations which might
weaken the imprcffions of truth ; and wtiich
are the more likely to be resorted to, in pro
portion as solid and fair arguments may be
wanting.
The substance of the firft piece, lifted from
its inconsistencies and its vague expressions,
may be thrown into the following' propor
tions :
That the powers of declaring war and |
making treaties are, in their nature, execp- !
tive powers :
That being particularly vested by the con
stitution in other departments, they are to be
confrdered as exceptions out of the general
grant to the execmtve department r
That being, as exceptions, to be construed ;
ftriftly, the p<Â»wers not ftri&ly within them,
remain with the executive :
That the executive consequently, a< the
organ of iiltercoiwfe witn foreign nations,
and the interpreter and executor of treaties
and the law of nations, is autborifed, to ex
pound all articles of treaties, thnfe involving
quelt'ions of war and peace, as well as others;
âto judge of the obligations of the ITrtWed
States to make war or not, under any cafus
federis or eventual operation of the cont raft,
relating to war {Â» Â«and, to pronounce the Rate
of things refuUing from the obligation- of
the United States, aÂ§ understood by the exe
cutive :
That in particular the executive bad au
thority to .judge whetber in the ca4Â« ol thÂ«

That its proclamation of the 22d of April i
lafl, kto be taken as the efFect and exprefiion |
of that decifioti.
The basis of the reasoning : s, we perceive,
the exttaordinary do&rine, that the powers j
of making war and treaties, are in their na- |
ture executive ; and therefore comprehended
in the general grant of executive power,
where not fpeciaUy and itii&ly excepted out
of the grant.
Let us examine this d'o&rine ; and that
we may avoid the pofflbillty of miftating the
writer, it fhallbe laid down in his own words :
a precaution the more neccflary, as scarce
any thing else could outweigh the improbabi
lity, that so extravagant a tenet ihould be
hazarded, at so early a day, in the face of the
public.
His xrftrds ateâ 44 TRwo of [excep-
qualifications to the executive pow
ers] have been aJrendy .noticed âthe partici
pation of the Senate in the appointment of offi
cers. and the making 0/ treaties. A third re
mains to be mentionedâthe right of the le
gislature to dedare war, and grant lettets ej
marque and riprifa/S'
Againâ'"Vdeferves to be remarked, that
is the participation of the Senate in the mak
ng treaties, and the power oi the legislature
:o dec/art war, are exceptions out of the general
recutivepower, veftcd In the Preficienr, they
ire to be court rued jiri<7/v, and ought to be ex- ;
rnded nofarther than izejfcntial to their exe
rution."
If there be any countenance to these pofi
lions, it must be found e-ther I ft, in the wri
ifcrs, of Authority, on public law ; o'r 2tl, in
:he quality and operation of the powers to
nake war and treaties ; or 3d, in the con di
lution of <thc United Stares.
11 would be of little nfe to enter far into
he? firft source of information, not only be- .
our owil reason and our own conttitu
ion, are the best guides ; but because a just
malyfiK and discrimination vi the powers of
government, according to tiieir executive,
egiflative and judiciary qualities are not to
>e expected in the works of the most receiv
ed jurffts, who wrote before a critical atten
;ion was paid to rhofe objects, and with their
eyes too much 00 mooarehical governments,
vhere all.powe/s are confounded in the fovc
eignty of the prince. It will be found how
ever, I belive, that ajj of them, particularly
W.olfius Burlamaqui and Vattel,fpeak of the
lowers to declare war, to conclude peace, and
10 form alliances, as among the highest a&s
)f tie sovereignty ; of which the legislative
>ower must at least be an integral and pre
eminent part.
Writers,fuchas Locke and Montesquieu, who
lave difcufled more particularly the principles
if liberty and the ftru<sture of government, lie
under the fame difadvantagc, of having writ
ten before these fubje&s were illuminated by
the events and discussions which diftinguifli a
very recent period. Both of thein too are
evidently warped by a regard to the par
ticular government of England, to which one
of them owed allegiance; * and the other pro
feijed an admiration bordering on idolatry.
Montesquieu, however, has ratherdiftingui/h
---ed himfelf by enforcing the reasons and the
importance of avoiding a confufion of the
several powers of government, than by enu
merating and defining the powers which be
long to each particular class. And Locke,
notwithstanding the early date of his work 011.
civil government, and the example of his
own government before his eyes, admits that
the particular powers in queflion, which, af
ter some of the writers on public law he calls
federative, are really dijiinQ from the executive,
though alinoft always united with it, and
hardly to be feperated into dijlinft hands,. Had he
not lived under a monarchy, in which thele
powers were united ; or had he written by
the lamp which truth now patents to law
givers, the last observation wbuld probably
never have dropt from his pen. But letusqmt
a field of research which is more likely to per
plex than to decide, and bring the question to
other tests of which it will be more easy to
jud^e.
2. If we confidt for a moment, the nature
and operation of the two powers to declare
war and make treaties it will be itnpoffible
not to fee that they can never fall within a
proper definition of executive powers. The
natural province of the executive mag'fttate
is to execute laws, Â«is that of the legislature
is to make laws. All his atts therefore, pro
perly executive, must pre-fuppofe the exig
ence of the Jaws to be executed. A treaty is
not an execution of laws : it does not pre
suppose the exifient e of Uws. It is, on the
contrary, to have itfelf the force of a law,
and to he carricd into exuulioty like all other
* Tht-chapter on prerogative, Picks houi much
tke rffon t>f the phi/ofipner uas by tU roy
a-'ifm of tic kngltjhmj*.
/aw.r 9 by the executive magi-jf?> To fay then
that t'Â»e power of making treaties which are
confefledly law*, belongs naturally to the de
partment which is toe.xecute law-?, is to Fay,
that the executive department naturally in
cludes a legiflativc power. In theory, tiais is
an absurdityâin practice a tyranny.
The power to declare war is fuhjeft so si
milar reasoning. A dfcclaratidn that there
fliall be war, is nor an execution of* laws : it
does not fuppofc pre-existing laws to be exe
cuted : it is not in anv refpeft, an a& merely
executive. It is, on the contrary, one of the
moil deliberativeaÂ£ts that can be performed ;
and when performed, has the etfeft of re
pealing all the law? operating in a ft Ate of
peace, so far as they are inconsistent with a
state of war : and of enabling as a rule for the
executive, a netvcode adapted to the relation be
tween the society and its foreign enemy. In
like manner a conelufion of peace annuls all
the latui peculiar to a state of war, and revives
the general laws incident to a state of peace.
These remarks will be fireiVgthened by ad
ding that treaties, particularly treaties ot
peaee, have fofae times the efife<sl of Changing
nor only the external laws of the fociery, but
operate alto on t)Â»e internal code, which is
purely municipal, and tQ which the legislative
authority of the country is of* itfe'f compe
tent and com pleat.
From this view of the fubjeft it mnft be
evident, that although the executive may be
a convenient organ of preliminary commu
nications with foreign governments, on the
fubje&s of treaty or war ; and the proper
agent for carrying into execution the final
determinations of the competent authority ;
yet it can have no pre ten (tons from the nature
of the powers in question compared wirh the
nature of the executive rruft, to that eflen
tiaJ agency which gives validity to such de
terminarions.
It must be further evident that, if these
powers be not iti their nature purely legisla
tive, they partake so much more of that, than
of any other quality, that under a confHtu
tion leaving then) to r.cfult to their oiott na
tural department, the legiflatuie would be
without a rival in its cl-aint.

A LETTER was read from the

Lanjuinais cdijUMjuei^ âFor three
days pait you ha*e witnelied a tlion
\ land irregularities and disorders :
an ambitious power has raffed lifelf
by your fide ; ic has revived the
troubles which it on the fir It day
affected to appeal'e.
Nothing has been rcfpedted, not
even the inviolable feerecy of lec
tersâthey have prevented my re
ceiving from the coinuiuue and ten
uous of Rennes, a letter which de
dales that 1 have defervcd well df
my country. [Here Lanjuinais was :
ltoppe'd by murmurs and hootings.]
Drotiei â I affirm that the fatt ad
vanced by Lanjuinais is falfe, and
that the secrecy of letteVs ha*' not
been violated. The Ditec r torof the
poll is piefcnt, let hiaÂ» be Wtfard.
Lanjuinais rcfunies bis speechâA
new committee has usurped the func
tions of tlie executive council; many
other committees have in like man
ncr afiumed the placet of theconfti
to;ed authorities. The revolution
ary committees of the fetftions con
tinue 10 exercise the powers which
you have declared not to belong to
liieui. A provisional commandant
has been named contrary, to law ; a
new iiene is in pi epaiation ; you
will wirnefs it in a few hours. On
Ttour-Way 1 predicted what would
take placeâprui* this day by my
predictions. Yellerday you were
prcfenied wiih a new lilt of pro
fcciptions; what have you done,
you have referred it to the commit
tee of public fafetyâand thereby
annulled the decree which declared
the address presented against 22 of
your colleagues to be calumnious.
[Loud clamours here again inter
rupted Lanjuinais ; Legendre and
fonte other members rufhirig for
ward to the Tribune; the tumult
continues, the Prefiderit put on his
hat; order is reftoi ed with difficul

manding ihat the revolutionary au
thorities ellablifhed in Paris^' sos"
three days part, should be abolished,
that their aJts fhopld be annulled ; ;
and that henceforth any perfoii who
should ufurpan illegal power,fhould- 5 i
be declared without the protection
of the law, and that any Citizen
might put him to death.
The debate was here interrupted
âthe Prelidenc announced a depu
tation from the forty eight seCtions,
and from all the conftiluted autho
rities of Paris, demanding to .be
heard at the barâadmission was in
rtantly decreed, the deputation pre
sented ihemfelves, and he who spoke
f on their behalf, saidâ
Deputies of the peopleâduring
four days the people of Paris have
not quitted their arms, the peace is
preierved, and their, perleveraiiie
applaudedâbut the pillars of the

I have sworn to my country, and imputed it ds
a (acred duty on myfelf never to permit private
confederations or other motives foreign from
the general weal to impede me in what I
ceived the line of duty. Myconduft has accord
ingly been marked with all the energy and
franknefs which ever c) ara&erize a true repub
lican. Toyoualoue, through the Secretary of
State, have I complained of tire piincipJes yon
have adopted, and remonstrated agaiuft deci

of our real and difiuterefted frientitfiip, were
facrificing our inteiefU to those of our enc/nies,
by their interpretation of the treaties which ex

without rcferve that this conduct did; not ap

with fidelity their public engagements or

and ve'rd iÂ£U of your juries, pride d to the fpntU
mcots of yom Uilow-ciuicus publicly txprtlf
icU.permit mt without i crimp to dtaw
thit inference.

one with impunity to treat you with diliefpcfl,

a magistrate deleaving of his high othce, lhould
ardently desire, wÂ« to you the greatest olieiiec
I could offer.
It is become necessary, Sir, tpdidlpate these
dark calumnies by traith, and publicity I
dare therefore to expert from your candor
and probity an explicit declaration, that â¢Â« I
have never intimated to you an intention of
appealing to the people ; that it is itot true
that a difference ill political sentiments has
ever betrayed me to forget what was due to
your character or to the exalted reputation
you had acquired by humbling a tyrant a

Gentlemen,
AMONG the various fubje&s which
at present occupy the attention of
the public, the conduit of the company
the Jupiter feeins to be none ot the
lealt interelling ; the ipeculative mind of
the public is held in suspense, and not
knowing the motives on which they have
aÂ£led cannot form a proper judgment of
their conduit.
The following atldreffes, therefore, as
tbey tend considerably to elucidate this
l'ubjeÂ£t, cannot fail of being acceptable.
1 The iit.ft which was sent to Citizen Ge
net requires little explanation. The com
pany of the Jupiter, anxious to investi
gate the causes and to discover the auth
ors of the late enormities committed at
Cape Francois, in which they weie influ
cncc'd to bear a part, and of which we
may every moment witneis the miserable
conftqutnces, have on just grounds of
suspicion arretted their commander, admi
ral Cambis, whom they are determined
to condu&. with general Galbaud, to the
national convention, to answer for their
refpeftive conduct before that anguft tri
bunal, and in cider the better to efle&
this purpose they are determined to lail,
as soon as pofiible for France.
The ir.inilter on the other hand, felici
tous for the. iafety of admiral Cambis,
and perhaps with a view towards tht re.ef
tabliihwent of order aiid union in the
fleet, held a council of war, at his lodg
ings on Friday evening last ; when among
other matteis, no doubt of equal impor
tance, it was detei mined that the prifon
erc should be liberated, and that the Ju
piter, with some other vessel of the fleet,
lhotild be sent on a ciuife.
The rtfult of" these deliberations were
yerbally communicated to the company
of the Jupiter, who finding tliem diaine
nically opposite to their intentions, there
upon tent the following additCs to the arn
bafiidoi'.

THE ictlon of deception is palled
there is not a French citizen who is un

âWe have penetrated through the ob
icurity of the council of war held yester
day at your hoofc, we were too much in

-We know Â»H, we are no longcnto be de

authors of those very crimes wbtc-invvv

al convention alone can be our judge, Mid
we will no longer remain here under the
pieffure of the mod gi ievoÂ«* aeoufsit ions
however great the glory, or however bril
liant the laurels which you'prorÃife. We
have no confidence but in the nation, arid' ;
we declare to you, that being determin
ed to go and demand at her tribunal Jaf
tice and Vengtauce, neither you nor any
other (hall detain us longer in the Ameri
can seas.
Galbaud, that citizen whom you, no
doubt are unacquainted wtth, fijjce we
know that you y out felt' calumniate'h iin,
fliall jro wiih us to the convention, '
Cambis, although tie withes to avoid if
fliall go there also, the Ton of Polyerel
&.le Blanc whom you wifli to escape from
on board the L'Eole, we will in like
manner condud to that dtead Couven-
tioa.
Galbaud, and ourselves, as .we are
conscious of our innocence, arc not a-
fraid to appear before that juil,tribunal.
Citizen minister, attend then to the
consequences. You contider us as culpa
ble, and before we hare jullified our
selves to- the national convention, you
fay that you will here makc.ua few the.
republicâShe fliould have t>o fervaott, no
defenders but fnch as are worthy of he r<
and when we (hall have ptoved to herthat
we are tier true children ; then, when we
I (hall be w.orthy to combat her enemies,
we will eocouncer them.
It iÂ« then to do purpose that you era
ploy against us and the other republicans
of our fleet, those arts and machinations
of the old policy, which though t&ey
might indeed be suitable to the Cabinet
of * Versailles that receptacle of lies and
tyianny, are not agreeable to the priuei
pies of Republicans.
Yon ate the Representative of there
public, be worthy of your office, and do
not keep us any longer at a diltance from
our country r for in spite of your efforts
we will go to her, and (he (hall then give
her judgement of that ast, which you
will not fail to fully with the name of dis
order and want of fuboidictation, but
which we call an ast of republicanifnj, be

of our duties, to vindicate out innocence
before the national convention. â¢'

attachment to the cause which they have

Ah ! brethren how great, how nume

Citizens, if we were culpable the ene

Mr. Andrcwi,
AS the fubjeiS of the Rights of Man
is more generally difcufied than un
derltood, and at I am a real fiiend to the
dofhine, (in a rational degree) permit
me to enumerate, through the channel of
your paper, certain rights the people of
this country have, and which I hope they
will forever strenuously maintain.
1. Upon the difiblutioa of the British
government in this countty, the people
had an unalienable right to form their
state conltitutions, by which individuals
gava up a certain portion of their natural
liberty, to secure and perpetuate the reft
for themselves and their posterity.
2. The great body of the people ip
the United States had an incontrovertible
right torefign a certain portion of feeble
state foveieignty, so as to form a national
constitution ; ans to clothe and invigorate
this government with fiich powers as to
raise the country out of a state of confu
fion and contempt, and make it compe
tent for the establishment of publick cre
dit at home and abroad.
3- The people, having thus eftablifli
ed a government for the common good of
United America, have the sole right to
maintain it againll all secret, wicked com
binations among themselves, and open
attacks from abroad.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
4- There is no restraint, either in the
{late or nations/ governments, upon an
individual, to worship God contrary to
the di&ates of his own confoienceâto
worship as he pleases is, besides, a natu
ral and unalienable right, and there is no
power on earth to controul it.
5. As the civil and religious rights of
the people are defined by the conllitution
al frames of government âconsequently,
individuals must be protedled in the fulled
extent, according to the social compact.
6. The citizens of America are not
more bound to obey constitutional laws,
than they are entitled to all the benefits
resulting from those laws.
7. If the legillature of the United
States, or that of an individual (late,
make laws which militate again ft the con
stitutional right of an individual, he can
oppose the will of the conltitution to that
of the legislature, and the judicial power
js bound to cairy the will of theconftitu
tion into effect.
8. As the people of these United
States have a right to defend their liv;s
and liberties, they have a right equally
strong, of acquiring, poffefling, arid pro
testing property âbut no man, or body
of men, can have any pretence of right,
upon the new dodlrine of liberty and
equality, to take the fruits of their in
dustry from them, and dillribute it among
a set of indolent, profligate levellers.
The Quack Doctors of liberty and
equality in England and France, have
wrote much upon this newfangled topick;
the firft of them who advanced the doc
trine, had nothing to lose : but in all my
reading I have not discovered an in fiance
wherein one of the advocates for liberty
and equality has diftvibuted his estate
among the needy. Until an example is
given by those reafoners, of a disposition
of their property, if they have any, in
to aliquot parts, between their offspring
and the beggars that present themselves
to a(k alms, I (hall continue to believe
that this position is advanced here, and
abroad, by such only as are without pro
perty, or by those who consider them
selves qualified to head a faction, and
through that medium raise themselves to
a (ituation of obtaining those profits and
honours which emetge out of a state of
confufion. " Every experimental philo
fopber (hould firft try the experiment on
hrmfelf, before he ele&rifies a whole nati
on."
I am Mr. Printer, a hard labouring
man, and, by the sweat of my brow,
have acquired a clear eflate of one thou
sand dol!ai sâmy neighbour Hodge Podge
had at lead this sum when he began the
world ; but he being a lazy, careless fel
low, (and gennrally roasting his shins in
the winter while I am foddering my cat
tle) is not now worth a (hillingâhe daily
calls on me for bread, to keep his family
from Itarvingâyet there is no one so cla
mourous for liberty and equality as he is.
I told him, in a convetfation we had
lately, that if his scheme could take effect
it was not likely, on account of bis idle,
careless way of living, that he would
long enjoy the benefit of my labourâO,
fays he, when you acquire more proper
ty, we will divide again.
