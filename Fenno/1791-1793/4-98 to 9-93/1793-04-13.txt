THE Pegr], belonging to Ply

No formidable blow has yet been

In every proceeding from the me
morable 14th of July to the present
moment, the new ulurpers of autho
rity in France have uniformly adopt
ed the system of depredation. It
was not the general welfare of the
public that {breed them up ; it was
an eye which ceitain individuals
had on the property of others, and
having a favorable opportunity to
carry thut plan into execution by
the murmurs of the people at the
enormities of the court party, they
seized a lucky moment, dethroned
the sovereign, made thentf'elves mas
ters of the wealth of the nation, o
bliged those who had riches to fly,
seized upon'their inheritances, and
then parted sentence of death upon
them if they ihould return. Hav
ing thus far carried the point, they
endeavored to seduce the rabble of
other countries to commit similar
infurretftions : for it is the maxim
nf robbers to cry down hone(ty,and
level all mankind to one common
flandard.
An effeÂ£ltial cure for the bite of a

. It looks as if the French, in esta
blishing republicanifin, wilhed also*
to bring back paganism. The

Since the days when Roman de

Tranquility and order are efta

The inhabitants of Constantino

The French are paying every pos
sible attention ,to the coultrucftion

The last requests of the unfortu
nate Louis breathe the foul of mag
nanimity, an<l a mind enlightened
with the fined ideas of human vir

which his enemies reported. His
heart was foundâhis head was clear
âand he woqld have reigned with
glory, had he but poflelled those
faults which his aflaflins laid to his
charge. His inind poflefted the ftig
geltions of wisdom ; and even in
his last moments, when the fpiric
of life was winged for another world,
his lips gave utterance to them, and
he fpuke With firmnefs and with re

The vessel of the late lamented
ilr. llunifey, to fail against wind
and tide has lately been tried, and
was found to fail four knots an hour.
The following is the principle upon
which it moves :â
A pump of two feet diameter,
wrought by a (leant engine, forces
a quantity of water up through the
keel. The valve isthen flint by the
return of the (Iroke, which at the
fame time forces the water through
a channel or pipe of about fix inch
es square, lying above and parallel
to the kelson, out at the stern, un
der the rudder, which has a left dip
than usual to permit the exit of wa
ter. The impetus of the water,
forced through the square channel,
against the exterior water, atfts as
an impelling power upon the tefl'el.
The rumours of yesterday were such as may
beexpe&ed at the present crisis. It was circu
lated, on the one hand, that General Cuftine
and his army had been cut to pieces. It was
fu'ggefted on the other, that General Dumourier
had been surrounded and destroyed by the army
of General Clairfait !
An intelligence more fatisfactory and more
confirmed was received by the Dutch mails of
yesterday. It was then declared, in the strongest
terms, that the division between the Patriots and
the Stadtholder was at an end ; and that the sense
of their common danger had united the people
of Amsterdam in one common bond of union.
The rumours of engagemeuts in the channel,
we cannot fay, from authority, are without
foundation. Several French frigates, and a
number of Englifti traders, have been captured
by that monitorâReport!

WORCESTER, April 4.
The death of the unfortunate Louis XVI.
"will probably draw upon the French Republic
the resentment of some Kingdoms, which, had
it not been for that event, would have remained
in a state of neutrality ; so that it is hardly to
be doubted that Euiope will be involved in a
general and very bloody War this summer.â
But, although the benevolent mind cannot but
be deeply affe&ed with the misfortunes of a
man whoever wished to merit the character of
the Father and Friend of his people ; yet it is tar
from being desirable that despotic power should
prrvail against the cause of Freedom; and it must
still be hoped, that the 4 French nation will be
able to efta\>lifh a form of government which
will effe&ually secure the lights of man.
STOCKBKIDGE (Mass.) April 2.
The accounts refpetting the murder of
Louis XVI. appear to be so well attested,
that humanity has not one cheating ray of
hope to enliven a probability that the intelli
gence is founded in error. The cruel an<i un
just affajjinauon of the late unfortunate Mo
narch, mufr ltamp indelible infamy on the
tranfa&ions of that ferocious party who, at
prelent, (way a many-headed monster of power
in the Gallic Nationâwhile history records
the unjust and bloody deed, an ir.dignant pos
terity will execrate the authors of it, to the
latest period of time. Those vehicles of abnfe
in our own country, which are conftant'v em
ployed in reviling the American Government,
and aspersing the chara&ers of its ablest sup
porters, its real and only friends, have alrea
dy began to croak their applause on tin? occa
sion, and to echo the huzzas of the " cut throats"
of Paris, at the melancholy exit of Loiisâ
To steel the heart against every generous and
humane feelingâto bar the avenue to pity
itfelf, the crimes of despotism and tyranny,
are, by them, attached to the chara<ster of
our late good ally and friendâThe exercise
of hereditary power was by btrch allotted to
the monarch, but a tyrannical use of it was
never laid to his charge, till party vengeance
deprived him of that freedom whose birth he
cherishedâ'till malignant fury exiled him
from the sweets of domestic life, and limited
the sphere of his liberty, to the confines of a
prison yard. 1 n the firft ft ages of the Ftench
Revolution, Louis avowed himfelf a friend to
libertyâand, at his positive command, the
Nobles aud Bishops were incorporated with
the reprefentativesof the people, one Aflem
blyâ'Tis truÂ«, at a dark period, when it
fee rued the determination of a violent party
to facrifice nlmoft moderate man, Â»|.
nioft every owner of extensive poifelFrons,
Louis was persuaded seek fafety by flight
-âthis fee in? to be the only material charge
supported against him on his late trial, where
his Judges were his ficcufers. But it will be
remembered, that at that period, many of the
promoters of liberty, Tome of the moil cele
brated Gallic patriots, thought their only
fafety confided in a voluntary exile from their
native country. The late French King un
doubtedly had faults, but they were such as
gratitude ought to have consigned to oblivion,
in confideratioti of the mnft important ser
vices rendered to his country in the cause of
freedomâand to the candid and unpreju
diced, who view ohjefts not through the me
dium of paflioo and party, his death must ap
pear a facrifice to the dilates of savage, un
relent ng barbarism, notwithttanding the ap
pianfe bestowed upon his alTaffins, by the de
tainers and flandcrers of our own free and
b*PP>' government.
American! attire liberty, and justly efti
mat? the excellent constitution which, thru'
the voice of th .ir freely elected delegate;, was
formed for the proteftjon and fecut ityofevery
blcffiug which freemen hold dear. The nfe
of that power which they have entruftcd to
their rulers, has been fiich aj to afford high
OtUfa&iou to the majority of tlia citizeni of
the American .Republic, although a set of un
principled slanderers, have made the Govern
ment, its operations, and the officers adtiug
under it, the themes of their defamatory
abule, from its commencement to the prelent
dayâThe views of this Government defam
ing cabal, seem extended only to the promo
tion of anarchy and confufionâevery blow
aimed at real good order and rational liberty,
is trumpeted by them as a deed of patriotism
âevery falfe construction of the true intent
and meaning of the laws, and every essay to
mislead the uninformed mind, is celebrated
with all the pomp and parade of levelling eloquence
âWhile on the other hand, tbofc who are
friendly to the administration of a wife, free,
energetic government, are ftiled the abettors
of delpotiim, favourers of absolute, uncon
trouled power, and charged with a design of
forging yokes for necks of freemen.âEven
the humane regret which has been expreflVd
for the unmerited, undeserved fate of Louis
XVI. is declared criminal, while the bloOd
feeking dagger of the a (Tallin, is denominated
the sword of regenerating, French freedomâ
Pretended astonishment is exprefcfed that Ame
ricans can regret the fate of a Tyrantâthe
fate of a Tyrant is nor the fubjecfc of regret
but the misfortunes of a Monarch whose heart
was ever foftened at the fight.of misery, and
whose good intentions for the welfare of his
people were once the theme of their univer
sal applatife, and whose interference in their
favor in a day of political darkness and gloom,
surely demands one generous sigh, one.
MANLY TEAR.
But astonishment and horror may both be
justly excited, when a Marat, a Roberfpierre,
and a Thwiot* can find applauders in this, or
in any other civilized country. Yet the
source from whence it springs, will undoubt
edly ifTue new encomiums on the conduct bf
Philip Equality,f and dub him as the firft of pa
triots, for his.late violation of eyery feeling
that does honor to the human heartâand if
so, may we not rationally conclude, that to
obtain the praises of zvh>Jkry-men t atTting in op
position to the laws of our country, neither
fathers, brothers, or sons, would escape the
lafli of the vilest abuse, even if they ftiould
not be fubje&ed to the power ofafTaffms.â
Time will operate convittionâand the com
munity at length be enabled (if they are not
already) to distinguish between the friends of
well regulated liberty, order and justice, and
the abettors of tumult, anarchy and confufion
âthe former will be rewarded with addi
tional confidence, and the latter meet the
contempt and scorn they richly merit.

r ocean has been always infected by
A certain ominous birds, known to the
American sailors by the name of Mother Ca
-ley s Chickens. Previous to a storm, they
often fur round a ship, with the molt discor
dant accents, chattering, screaming, scolding
and singing. 11l weather and ill luck always
follow. The itonteft seamen are terrified at
their appearance, and no one dares to climb
the fin ouds, or even to handle a rope, while
they continue around the ship. Not Dav*y
the demon of the waters, infpiresmore
terror than these boding chatterers. The
horror and detestation with which they are
viewed, has hitherto prevented an accurate
investigation of their shape, size, and nature.
But we are informed that a certain great mo
dern philosopher and politician, has latelv got
a small brood of them into his pofleflion.' He
finds they are of the fame species as the Par
rot, and are readily taught to utter any arti
culate founds, which they will repeat with
incessant chatteringâthough he is not yet
able to discover, whether thev have a)iy com.
prehenf.on of the meaning. He also finds that
they poltefs the power of divination in a
greater degree than the holy Chickens which
were preserved with such attention by the
College of Augurs, in antient Rome.âWe
understand that he means speedily to publish
an accurate defci iption of these extraordi

oracles they have uttered, while in his coop,
which he as far superior to the
Sibylline oraclcs, or to auy of the antient pro

public may receive some further light on the
fubjeft, from the following
ixtraa oj a httrditcd on hoard the Federal Ship,
in the Latitude uj Philadelphia
" Dea* StR,
" Lift night, as we were going on under an
easy fail, after mod of the crew were turned
in, we were all at once alarmed by a most
horrid nniftf, and found ourselves furrotinded
by Mother Carey's Chickens. While the fonnds
we'e diftaor, they refemblid the notes of
a Jack-Aft, who bad learned to imitate the
tunes Â«f a Caterwaulinjâbut as they ap
363
proached nearer, we were astonished to hear
a variety of articulate founds, repeated with
as much rapidity as the speeches of King
Gtorge.Vn Peter PjndarâAmidit all the confu
fion, we could distinguish the wordsâ" Aris
tocrat! Aristocrat I Hell of Monarchy ! Salh
and Ribband ! Apollyon son of Belial ! Trea
sury Blood-Tucker ! Light out of Chaos ! Poor
Soldier ! Liberty and Equality ! Down with
the Prefklent ! Down with the Aristocrats !
&rc." Our crew turned out with the utmost
confternaticnâfome crept under the hatches;
one of the officers proposed to fire all the can
non in the Ihipâbut he was aflured by the
old Teamen, that these birds were sacred to
the furies, and that our instant deftru&ion
would be the consequence of any hostile attack.
Jemmy Turncoat ran below deck with a
hatchet, in a fit of delirium, and would have
fcuttlcd the Ihip, if he had not been prevented
by his comrades. Qthers walked up and
down the deck, wringing their hands, and
making the nioft doleful speeches imaginable.â
But the Captain and most of the officers con
tinued firm and steadyâ-it was agreed that
we ihould lie too and wait the event. The
Chickens growing bolder, advanced to the
fides of the (hip. One of them exclaimed,
that he was a member of the honorable order
of the Goose, lately instituted in honor of the
Goole who saved the Capitol, and that he was
to be placed as a guard in the Federal Cityâ
he displayed two feathers in lus tail, as the
insignia of his office. Another alighted on the
bow-sprit, and began to address us in a set
speech, as follows :â" Arrah by my Jhoul t Citi
zens andCiUjfes"âBut having a tpuch of the
brogue, he made such horrid work in pro
nouncing the words Citizen and Citefles, that
even they who were most terrified, could not
refrain from laughing. One clapping his
wings at the fonthward of the ship, warbled
out an hymn to Pocahontas, the tutelary Saint
of Virginia, who presided at the Federal
Elettion. One being mounted on the main
-mail-, ftuig in mournful notes the death and
apotheosis of Peter Pendulumâafter which he
announced himfelfas King killer General, and
affirmed that Paine and Petion acted solely by
his ini'piration. At length, at a given signal,
they all rose on the wing, and went off tinging
Lillibullero in concert, leaving behind, like
the harpies, a most terrible stench, and our
decks all covered with their ordure. We
have ever since had dangerous weather, and
there is every appearance of a storm from
the south. We trust, however, to be able to
weather the squall, aiid (b God fend the good
ship to her destined port. Your's, &c.''
The publisher of the foregoing letter adds,
that in his opinion, these ill-boding Chickens
are the fame creatures as the Grccian Har
pifc% whom they resemble completely in man
ners, habits, and the prophetic spirit. In
proof of which he refers us tb y?rgil's descrip

THOUGHTS ON THE
STATE OF AMERICAN INDIANS.
(Continued Iron No. 7%, of this Gazette.)
No. hi.
ANOTHER caDfe which lÂ»aÂ» re
tarded Ihe progress of focipty
and manners among the Indiafis, a -
rises from the diminution of their
numbers. Whatever has contribut
Â«Â«l in any degree 10 this efteii, has
an indirect influence in preventing
their improvementâThese inciden
tal causes are derived from the de
cay of the sources of subsistenceâ
the multiplication of warsâthe use
of spirituous liquors, and the intro
duction of new diseases. The ordi
nary employments of a people 111 uft
be overltocked, before they will
turn their attention to other spe
cies of industryâand the common
sources of subsistence must be ex
handed, before they will seek to
procure other means of support.
The prefling calls of hunger only
can excite a spirit of enterprize and
innovation among a people natural
ly ignorant, and averse from ?iny
kind of employment that requires
much labor and confinement.
A nation of hunters, in the ordi
nary progress of society, must be
come too numerous to subsist upon
the ordinary product of the chafe,
before they will become shepherds,
or seek subsistence from the foilâ
These different ltages in society na
tnrally succeed in Â«rder, as popula
tion increases and a. larger fund of
provision become* requisiteâThe
fame extent of country which is ne
cefTary to support a few hnnters,will
maintain a larger proportion of shep
herds, and a (till greater number of
huibandmen.
The increase of the human spe
cies is, in all ordinary cases, in pro
portion to the means of subsistence.
A favorable climate, a fertile foil,
easy means of procuring food, pro
vision for the aged and infirm, and
finiplicity of talle and manners, en
courage marriage, and rapidly ac
celerate the multiplication of man
kindâThe fame causes produce the
fame effecft in the civil and savage
dateâln proportion as these ope
rate, they multiply andprogiefs to
wards civilization. The liiftory of
the population of Egypt, of India,
of China, of Greece, of Rome, and
particularly qf all new-fetiled coun
tries ill uft rate and confirm these re
marks.
Hunting and fifhing are the prin
cipal sources of support among . sa
vage nationsâthe latter affords a
more easy, certain and plentiful Alp
ply than the formerâlt is on this
account, that in all new countries
the coasts and branches of large ri
vers are stored with inhabitantsâ
Illands for the fame reason are more
populous in proportion to their ex
tent, than countries of the fame di
mensions on the continent. At the
time of the discovery of this coun
try, the natives drew their support
principally from these two sources
âThe whole coast and the banks of
rivets were then peopledâand the
remaining monuments of their
towns, and the rude instruments of
art which are daily difcovered,prove
that their numbers were very con
siderableâThe frequent emigrati
ons and rapid increase of the whites,
soon disturbed the fettlemenrs of the
natives, and finally removed them
from the coast.âThus the geoeral
settlement of this country utterly
cut off one source of the Indians'fup
port ; and the growing improve
ment and cultivation of the coun
try, have ever since been diminish
ing and impoverishing the otherâ
To these we may add the influence
of a more unfavorable climate, in
increasing the neceflity of further
and more difficult precautions to de
fend themfeNes againfl the incle
mency ofthe feafons--in augmenting
the neceflity of a larger support
while at the fame time it diminishes
the fonrres of supply, by lessening
the number, size- and nutritive vir
tue of the animals which furnifh it
âand by rendering it more difficult
to procure them.
It is unneceflary to enter into a
detail oftheinnuraerable evils which
have resulted from the diminution
of thofjs fourccs from wliicji they
formerly must have derived an easy
and abundant fubfillence.
The increased difficulty and un
certainty of procuring food, null
neceflarily render them averie from
the incumbrance of a familyâmar
riage becomes lets desirable, and
children become a burden rather
than an ornament and blcfling â
tbe quality of their food is inipo
verilfjcdâis less favorable to propa
gation, and yields less nutriment to
the offspring.
A scarcity of gamp also expoles
them to the miseries of famine, and
unfavorable seasons fubjetft them to
numberless evils and inconvenienc
es which they cannot forefee, and
against which they are unable to
provideâThe necessity of spending
more time in the chafe than when
game was more plenty, gives an un
favorable complexion to their man
ners ârenders them more ferocious
âless susceptible of the feelings of
humanity, and more infenlible to
the allurements of civilized life.

TO THE PUBLIC
THE Authoi is sensible that the filft edition
of his American Geography (which makes Part
I. of the above work) was in many instances de
leflive, in others erroneous, and in some often-*
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was his
desire, in the present edition, to lupplv the defi
ciencies, correct the errors, and meliorate the
offenfive parts of the last. To aflift him in this
butinefs, he has received many valuable commu
nications from the heads of department in the
general government, and from gentlemen of re
fpeftability in the several states. The descrip
tion of foreign countiies (which cornpofes Part
11. of the above work) has been carefully, com
piled from the mod approved writers on Geo
graphy, and ufelul information introduced from
the discoveries of the latest Navigators, Travel
lers, and relpe&able authors. Indeed, no pains
nor expenfc have been spared to render this work
the mod complete, accurate, and ufeful of any
ever offered to the public.

The following character of the above work,
is given in the Review of the Majachvfetts Ma-

i 4 This is a very ufeful work, and is no ill
proof of ihejudsment and industry of the author.
The rules are laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are fufticient for their il
lustration. One part of the work deserves par
ticular commendation. We mean that which
the author stiles " Mercantile , Arithmetic " It
occupies a considerable portion of his book, but
not more than its importance will jufiify. We
would recomroend to the young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to this branch.
He will find its principles well explained. And
(hould he make himfelf matter of them, be will
always have rea<on to acknowledge bis obliga
tion to the judicious and laborious author. We
cannot but congratulate the rising generation on
account of the many ufeful produflions which
have lately appeared; and in which their im
provement has been principally consulted.â
Among those pioduQions we mnll place this
treatise of Arithmetic. We (hould be wanting
