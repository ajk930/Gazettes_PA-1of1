h E'SQ'tX'Ep, that the- Sccrcraty of the
CV Treal'ury has omitted to diftharge anef

-1783, a'nd'oi thfe caufc's of making luth
Irafts.
V(r. Daytbii said, that s& Jo late an hour of
lie was unwilling to detain the coin-
Kitta'a uimeteirarilv'; he t ruffed however that
iliej; wÂ«jiitÂ«l'gi ani him their
:e'iition for a i'e\v moiiwut? before .the vots
vas take a- The reftjjnilbii upon "which the
enle of the comitiltcee v.-a$ aeon' to he ett
>fefftri, contained a direct charge pgajnft the
Secretary' riCthe Tieafu'iy for having; " foil
rd to 4ve Congress official information itj
lac tiras oftfie monies drawn by him from
Europe into the Oniteci State?,; and of the
li'uies of futh drafis." He role princijWllv
:o remarli, that the argtaJnenjs which had
>ejn uied by the advocates of tiiefe refbluti
,u; in fnpport of the firft that had been dif-
Misled, anil particularly by the member frorr
Virginia (Mr. Madifonj were of such a nature
is ntuft, if applied to the one now urcier dc
iate, compel that gentlem'pn to abandon thi
hi g? and give it his negative, jffrewou
jrclerve any fort of consistency between hi
ifguments and his vote.
It had been alTerted by him, and feemeid tc
ie relied upon as an important fact, that the
Secretary's agency in, refp'eft to foreign loans,
3id not neceiTarily result from the duties of
lis ofac?, or the conftitutiou of* the treasury
l;p'artinent which on that head was lent,but
ii it it was founded upon a special commiiiio.n
iod in'ftr udrions given to that ollicer by the
'resident in whom the laws had veiled an au
:hbrity. Under that view then it was dt-em
!&"convenient and'pfroper to regard the Pit
ul.*nt as the 'principal, and the Secretary as
lis agent, in order that there might ap,>car
:6 be (brhe foundation for the charge avStlnft
the*latter, for having acted in any inltance
tvithdut the express inftruftioii o:' the former.
If this was truly the relanonftiip in which the
Secretary itood to the Presidentâif the Pre
sident's commifiion was his authority, and the
Pre fide nt's inftr'uftions, his Jaw and guideâif
the cafe" of loans wail in relpeft! to the treaty:
ry department, an extraordinary and extra
ofEcial one, not neceflarily falling* under the
Head of it, bur dVfrm,CL from t!ie ordinary re
venues which bounded his legal authority, as
htfH hePn'declared by a member from Virgi
nia and another from "Ponnfylvania, Mr.Day
ton called upon thole two gentlemen to ex
plain, with what propriety the Secretary of
tht Treasury could be ceiikited for not com
pnfing in his annual oHwial fiateiaent of* re
ceipts and 't'/Kpenciftures of public monies in
his department, a report, of hjs agency in a
business unconvicted therewith, which he
trahfaft&d not in quality of financier, but of
agent,'and for which' he was reA)onfi
b!& tb the' President, who,was his principal,
ftoiitstlsfs Would, have di"f
innied him from office, if he h.id aaed un

and when we wanted i'll format ion, we were
told by fonle of the friends of the bill, that it j
was iÂ»ot convenient to give information there
âthat we might procure information else
where, as they had done. I confefs I d'ei not
comprehend this method of legislating p. but
ihe Secretary has since cxpl uned ir in one ,ol
lis reports, by comply Mug of the Hoqfe, be
laufe the members did not 30 to his oifice,
;nd aUc intormatio.n, instead of requiring ir
1 be publi&l? reported. v."
Even when this favorite bill for a nev
yan war, before thp House, the Secretary di<
lot condescend to inform us, that he hid
/ithout authority;* |> ovitled nearly a inillioi
md a hiilf of dollars for that porpofc < H\
lid not-inform us how obligingly he ha<
Irawn bills upon our bankers in Holland, Cl
iave the money put in our way.
Thus, in order to anticipate the payment
due to the bank W did. what he coald, to in
duce Congress to break the public iaitb, b>
repealing the exifti-ng app'opriation, r.md
for feeurrog the discharge of a debt of jufiici
and gratitude to the French nation. Fron
this, and other instances, it appears, that how
ever high the Secretary's regard for publh
credit may be, there are other coniideration_
â¢which have obtained a higher degree oi his at
tention, than obedience to the laws. Tin
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madison) ha:
so tlevrlv explained the nature of rhnt <>fci ei
tion with which the Secretary is vested, anc
(b fully proved that there was i) 0 u
jutlify a departure from the appropriations
made by law, that it is not neceflary ,f<sr m<
to explain further on that head. , However,
I cannot help remarking, that the discretion
ary powers were pretty freely exerciied.â-
Tie drawing of bills began early, indeed*-
and .we re. continued to a recent period : The
times of drawing fortunately correfpondec!
with the necelfities of the bank, and the pow
er ofeiiiployiwg agents wa': pretty freely used".
The fame agents were frequently both the
fellers and the purci(afer* of the bills. Per
haps this was nece&uy : Nodoribt if%ks coiJ

fay, Â»t will be always so ?

He said he was op'pofed to the referrenfce

examined the ieveral reports on which the
examination depended-, and was then ready
to vote on themâthough be, copfcflgj from

could fa.v he was completely'-matter of the
fubse<Sbr-*Siimc vote, was.now ren
dered etfential to the ehara&er not only of
government, but of the gentleman who pre
sided over the finances of the country. But
three days were left for this enquiry, and toâ
finifii a gretf deal of other businessâand he
i thought that dilpatch which was u iial in the
House, ought to .lie used in preference to the
indulgence whrch a committee affordedâAs
to the abitraft proportions, if it were necef-.
i fary now to go into them, he thought it woyld
Ibe proper to decide on them fir ft. He tlio't

"With relpeftto all the other resolutions, he

to be unwarranted by fafls. He hoped the

would not be gratified at so late a season, bj
the Houle in resolving irfrf) into a committee

I HAVE feeo, in your lafl paper,
the copy of a com million which
the Secretary of the VVeftern Go
vernment endeavored to intpofe on
the Judges of one of the county

traordinary commiHion exhibits fea
tures so novel ; it is fwoln with
such affeitation of pomp, and struts
on luch stately stilts, that indeed,
Mr. Printer, f could hardly believe
(any evidence in your Gazette to the
contrary notwithstanding) that the
production 111 question was really
jimerican. Rubbing well my eyes,
however, and carefully wiping the

ceeded to adjust them to my nose in
the molt exaift, approved, and criti

Philadelphia, April 3.
A mnft atrocious murder was com
mitted on board the ship Wasp, of
Brrftol, Robert Jones, matter, on or
about the 20th January lastâlaid
(hip arrived in Montego-Bay, Ja
maica, ontheeveningof thatday.â
The person murdered was Thomas
Hedges, the surgeon of the/hip. Jt
appears from the depositions taken,
that she failed from Bristol to
Africa for il*ves, and arrived after
wards at Jamaica with a cargo of
200. That designs against the sur
geon's life .were entertained from
the beginningâand after a series of
ill nfage, be was dispatched the day
previous to the arrival of the ship,
with circumstances of savage bar
barity.
The villainy appears to have been
perpetrated by a number of the peo
ple belonging to the ship, with the
connivance of the Captain. The
fliip lay in Montego-Bay 34 days,
and has ftnce failed Cor Bristolâthe
morder wasnot di(covered till after
/he had failed. Meafares have been
taken by the authority at Jamaica
to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The flÂ»ip is i'4t tons ineafttrement,
painted black* figure head, copper
bottom, Guinea-man's round-house,
and had some caronades mounted,
and it is supposed will not go to
Brillol, though cleared for that
place.âRobert Jones, the Captain,
is a young man, about J feet 4 or j
inches high, and only 20 years of
age.âJoseph Nees, the fleward,
light tawny complexion, about 5
feet 9 inches high.âThomas Beddo,
the boy, is a thin lad, his hair sup
posed to be light, tho' he always
wore a handkerchief over it, 5 feet
; inches in heightb, pock-fretten.â
Jack, a yellow negro, of a very (lout
make, and spoke a good deal of Eng
lish.
The above described persons are
represented as the atftive and pafTive
initmmentsin the aforefaid murder.
One of the Paris Gazettes (Patii
ote b'ranctis) among other remarks
on a certain American publication,
makes the following ;
" There is now translated into
French a book entitled the Federalifl,
or a collection of pieces in of
the constitution, propoftd for the
United States of America, by the
Convention of 1787, publiflied in
New-York, by Meffieors Hamilton,
Madifan and Jay, citizens of the
United States. The bookseller, Ba
ijfon, has done France great service,
especially in her present circum
stances, in publilhing this work
which is clearly the best the world
has hitherto seen on the fubjecft of
confederate government. It mult
be confeffed, however, that in foine
places, there are passages, taken in
certain views, wherein we may re
mark an ariftocratical tendency ;
but in general the political maxims
are excellent."
Extrafi of a letter from Columbia,
IVijlern Territory, to a gentleman
in this city.
" As young as this place is, there
is a remarkable third and tafte.for
learning in it. We have already
an Academy here, nnder tlic joint
care of two men of abilities, in
which the English, Latin, and Greek
languages, the Mathematics, and
various branches of the Arts and
Sciences are taught. Perhaps yon
will think it incredible, when I af
faire you that in this academy, at
the aforefaid different branches of
learning, there are already sixty
scholars. There is another Latin
and Greek School at Cincinnati,/fix

" I arrived hete shortly after the news of
the late attack oil Mr. Hamilton had reached
this, and am very glad to find it has upenei
the eyes of many who have hitherto btcn un
der the implicit direction of certain aot'ld it
umpires of the United States in Cungrel',.
One of the reports, which I find circulated
to the prejudice of this gentlemaji is, that ne
has not done lb much as be ought toajlilt cer.

which they declare they performed ilnrjijw tbe

which have tended to four the minds of ma

Â« I have lately been on tie ground-de
signed for the retidence of Congress after the

in point of situation, of convenience for com

expected from nature. I hope time willjf.
ford a completion in every requisite that art
can bestowâand that it will, as it isthe last, ,
be the firft city in the universe. The only
objections which I have heard to jhis situation
for the government, are certain local preju
dices and a tincture of antifWeralifm in fniite
people of the vicinity. Maryland is one of
the mo ft fecUi a] States in the union, and Vir r

a much more urfavorable afpeft than thole of

disturb our peace and unity.
In ffiort, I am so much pfeaftd with the
new city, that I have determined one day to
fix on the spotâand Aral! be happy to fee you
my neighbor. The public works are progreC.

pidly that r _ined Port Kofeway, and which
injured Baltimore about 5 or 6 years ago,
(from which however flie has since recovered)
but in a sober-minded manner, worthy of the
prudence and spirit of the Commissioners.â
These gentlemen are pad the time oflifefor

however they are daily incurring the censures
of certain light-headed neighbors,-particularly
among the land-holders. These men finding
their lands have risen about 1000 per cent. 1
are now angry that thay do not rife to ten
times this value, and are da'vlv growing more
and more fit for a lunatic hospital, which I

The Bakers of Philadelphia and
Bolton Imve petitioned the Legisla
tures of Pennfylvaniaand Maflachu
fetts refpe<fti*ely, for a repeal of the
law regulating the price and assize
of bread.
The Petition of the Bakers in Boson
contains theJo/Jntuing hrft-trical Jkttch.
" IN Gr<?r-Britain, the Bakers
are and have been, for more than
400 years, an incorporated compa
ny, possessing exclusive privileges ;
and authorized to restrain, by limi
tations ai\d reftri<Sions of various
forts, the competition to a finaller
number, th-an might otherwise go
into this bufineftâwhich is attend
ed with the fame confequenoes as a
monopoly, though in a less degree.
To counterbalance the evilsofthefe
incorporations, this law was produc

a just and true level. It ought not
to be omitted, that'the wisest and
uioft celebrated writers in England,
constantly and publicly aflert that,
where there is no excluiive corpo
ration, the competition will regu
late the price, much better than any
aliizeâamong many fatfts which are
adduced in fuppori of their opinion,
the following is cited, viz.âThe
method of lix'tng theaflize of bread,
eltablifhed in the reign of George,
11. could not be put in practice in
Scotland, oil account of a defect in
the law. its execution depending
upon the office of Clerk of the mar
ket which does not cxiit thereâ
fbis defect was not removed nntil
the reign of George HI. the want of
an afiize, as is declared by an emi
nent Scotch writer, occasioned no
fenfire inconvenience, and tlieeita
blilhment of one in a few places,
â¢where it has yet taken place, has
produced i>o i'ciitiWe advantageâ
in the greater part of the towns of
Scotland, however, there is an in
corporation of Bakers who claiin
exehvfive privileges. InMafiachufews
there is no incorporation of Bakers

On Friday the Senate of this

confideralion the hill' lent from the

ing and amending the incorporation
laws of Philadelphiaâthe principal
of which is, to veil the judiciary,
legiflatiye and executive powers,
exercised by the corporation, in dif- I
ferent bodies. âA motion was made
by Mr. Morris to pojtpone the firft
feiftion, for the purpose of introduc

which was, to let the prel'ent mayor

with indignation the excess of those mis-
Creants who (tile themselves the Counter-

be sent to challife the rebels. Ships of

paitit merits to foreigners. A writer
under the signature of /fa//?//, who

of the past winter, undertakes to
defend the policy of such appoint

from a publication in the General
Advertiser of yesterday in answer
to Ruflell :
" Would Ruflell present his pro- j
pei ty to a stranger in preference
to a filler or a brother I If merit
was to decide the donation, perhaps
he might meet with an equal if not
aluperior degree of merit in a stran
ger, why then will he not give it
to, the moil deserving ? Our coun*
trly is our common parent, and in
the distribution of its benefits kin-
I di;ed are to be considered before
adieus. It is to be. hoped that ge
nius, information, and virtue are
not quite so rare, that with foreign
n\anufaftures, we must be obliged
toi import foreigners to govern our
country! Hitherto our progress _in
the one is unequal to European im
provement, I have the pride of
country so much about me as to sup
pose, that in the other we are not
exceeded by any nation upon earth.
COMMU-RI(Â£ATK>NS.
The man who has a great deal of
money wishes to get nnre. Accord
ingly we fee men who have enough,
rilk all to gee more, which they do
not want, and would not, if they
had it, know what to do with it. Oi

wHI not (land still. A people rich
in liberty are very apt if they can
not have more,to wif'h for something
different. Having all, they cannoc
incre .fe their stock, but they would
change it. Many are fond of trying
new things, and in this temper pre
cious old ones are often flung away.
It is not true to affirm, that oppres
sion only, will excite a desire for
change. It is in the nature of man,
and the friett nation may be made
to figii for new schemes of politics
with all the ardor of fuffering free-
men,
Those who sow jealousies and dif
.ord in the union have the address
to hold up the allurements of new
theories, as fpccious in argument, as
they would prove pernicious in the
trial. Liberty is certainly one of
the gifts to man ; it is hu
ftaie of perfection.âBut like his
state in paradise it is i'urrotinded
with temptation. The serpent is
every where tempting the people
to pludk the fair frnit.âThofe who
tempt, would be the firft to revile
and tortnent them in their fallen
itate. May the Liberty of America

and danger, eUape the arts of those
ttllaffins who flatter to destroyâwho

dain to be guided by theiigiit of
experitence, or to adapt their poli

and euthnfiafm. They would very
properly found their Babel on a
quagmire. Trace the theory of our
fault-tinders and mark its inconlift
encies. They hate banks, yet they
always favor the making more.â
They hate fine spun theories, yet all
their schemes are repugnant to na
ture and expeiience. They sup
pose men. devils as soon as they gee
into office, and yet they aff'ciU a pu
rity in t heir theory of government,
that angels would scarcely prove

" 1 know not whether the ap
pearances of reform in England
and Scotland are to be- conlidered
as favorable to liberty. I should
have liked better to find Mr. Fife
continue in the pride of his power
till the people thenifelves burlt their
(hackles. I fear if the reform is to
come from government it v.ill be
like the amendments of the federal
conflitutionâa tub to the whale.â
It may be otherwise, and will doubt -
less be a more peaceable way, but
it is dill building; on it bad founda
tion.
" T like the spirit from wljich the
pf-efent fafhionable address of Ci
tizen proceeds ; but, like a new cut
in cloaihs, I cannot help thinking
there is a little affectation in it â
This feeling a little time will re
move, especially as the appellation
is of an endearing nature âI flionld
like better to have the name only.
As you know fafhions take feme
time to arrive here from the me
tropolis, I mud take a little time to
reconcile myfelf to it ; and get o
thers here to keep me in countf
nance. For this once yon will there

an aristocrat if on the outfida I re
tain the former appellation. But
