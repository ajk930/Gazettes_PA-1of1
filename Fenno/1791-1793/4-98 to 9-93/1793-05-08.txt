appears that the French on the 18th,
attacked the Auftrians at Nerwiud,
near Thirlemont. That they were
repuifed in the centre, and on the
right. That they made (bine iuj
prelfioii on the left wing in the af
ternoon, when Gen. Clairfayt bro't
into adtion 12,000 horse, who de
cided the victory. The French for
some time made good their retreat,
but being at length broke, the Aus
trian cavalry made dreadful havoc
amongst them, and killed between
jfix and seven thaufand.âThey con
tinued the slaughter until rhe ap
proach of night, when the courier
was dispatched with the above news,
who reports that the French had
Iflft 34 pieces of cannon.
The exprefsfent to Carlton-houfe
is* finiilar to the above, except that
the loss of the French is slated at
2000 men, and 32 pieces of cannon.
Letters from Bruflels state, that
Pumourier attacked the combined
trmy at 7 o'clock in the morning,
between TirlentÂ«nt and St."Tron.
the battle was fought with various
success till the afternoon, when the
ardourand intrepidity of the French
troops surmounted every obstacle.â
Valence at their bead,they charged
the left wing of the enemy so furi
oufly, that it was soon broke, and
gave way in every dire<ition. The
purfitit vvÂ«s vigorous for some time,
and great carnage ensued. At that
moment when the combined army
was threatened with a Compleat de
feat, Gen. Clairfayt flanked the
ptfrfuers with an immense body of
horse, and as they had pushed for
wards beyond the protection of the
artillery, they were left exposed to
the superior power of the cavalry.
Gen. Valence alternately retreated,
and advanced till he was killed by"
a musket ball. The contest was ob
stinately maintained, until it was
put an end to by 1 he darkness of the
night, and both fides claimed the
vicftory.
It appears by dispatches which go
vernment have received this rnorn-
by way of Flushing, that the'
victory on the 18th was only a pre-
Jude to 11 ill Â£'eaxfcr success.

the fnccefs of the Audrians was de

The atfiion took place near Lou

Further accounts by the Englifi papers
stateâThat the Duke of IVunfw'.ek has so
violent a reJapfe of his late difo-rder that his
life is despaired of. Orr the firft Mardi the
Prince de. Cobourg took the command of the
Auftrians under General Clairfait and forced
the French linesâon the 2d he drove the
French from Aix-la-Chapelle and Maeftricht
âon the 3d he went to Maeftricht in person
and reinforced that Garrison with 1,60 cx tpen
âon the sth and 6th he-detached a Gevniarr
corps to *ttaÂ£k Ruieinondeâthis body in'con
junction with the troops under Prince Fre*
derick of BÂ«unfwick took that placedâthe
French at the fame time evacuated Fore St.
Michael opposite Venloâwhich they had bom
barded many days without effe<ft.~The
Prince de Cobourg also detached a body of
troops under the Arch Duke Charles of Au
ftrja, to difpofiefs the French of Tongres, in
which he succeeded.âThe French also eva
cuated St. Tron. Lifege was taken by the
Auftrians the sth. Roberfpierre, Lacroix
and Dantorn. complained of treachery inl the
affair of Aix-.la-Chapell'eâand on a motion
made by.them the Convention decreed .that
Generals Stengel andLanoue ftiouldbe brought
to the bar and their papers sealed up. Thir-
Jemont, Gertruydenberg, Klundert; William- -
ftadt, Doevern, Bruflfels, and Sardinia, it is'
faitf, have been evacuated and (tefet ted by
the FrenchâBreda, by the last accounts, was.,
still in their hands, to which they were lea
king additional fortifications. A letter from
Brulfels, dated 7th March, published in a
French paper fays,â u after ralfing the siege
of Maeftricht, the French formed a body of
men, and therebyput pu effe&uaj ft op.
to the progreQs of the Prince de Cobourg's ar~ -
my." . the French Corpmiflioo
ers", in Belgium, was read in the National
Convention on the 11 th March, which fays,
Our fiiccefles in Hollahd are encreafed, and
thesrcity'of Amsterdam is ready to open her :
gates to.the French army.âThe most fpiFited â 
exertions were making at the above period,,
in Paris, to reinforce tlje armyâin every
feftion fubferiptions were opened, and those
who Could not serve their country in person,
depOsited on its altars a part of their wealth,
âthe National Convention condu<sl with a
firmnefs and intrepidity which impresses the
minds, of all with the dignity of the revolu
tion. * The French AmbalTador left Madrid
the 18th Februaryâa fleet was equipping by
the Swedes at Carlfcroon, the destination of
which is not announced. A Jubilee was to
be celebrated in Sweden in commemora
tion of the introduction of the Chr.iftian
Religion into that countryâthis jubilee was
to be held at Upfal in March iaft. A Rufiian
fleet is to be shortly sent into the northern
seas. Reports of th-- go- -
vernmentof Sweden prevail at Stockholmâ
other accounts fay that the lenient measures
pursued by the regent have calmed the public
miod. The last accounts from the Eaft-ln
dies announce that Trppoo is so humbled that
peace may be for a long time expelledâhe
has made another payment of the Seringapa
tara moneyâand it is supposed the young hos
tages, his sons, will ibon be redeemed âA
great scarcity of provisions prevails in many
parts of India. The late fuccefles of the com
bined armies against France appear to have
excited great agitations in Paris.âM. Petion
was insulted by the populaceâand M. Marat
conduced hqine in triumph.âlVt. Eg&lite and
his son the Genera! it is said have both quar
reled with M. Dumourier-â the fame accounts
further (av that there is a great commotion
among tho people throughout every part' of
the republic ; these are imputed to various
causes, the principal appears to be the scarci
ty and high prices of provisions. In Paris,
during the month of January last, there were
no less than one hundred and fifty-five divor
ces ; the marriages at the fame time were
two hundred and thirty-fix only, and the
greater part of these resulted from the divor
ces themselves.
Art unprecedented attachment has been
made by ths kingS attorney genera] of the
sum of one hundred thousand pounds fteiling,
(landing in the bank of England in the name
of MeflVs. Bordieu and Chollet.
The avowed pretext is, that they fufpeft
this sum to belong to che government of
France, and they have filed a billiu chance
ry to make the English house mnfwer to inter
rogatories, upon oath, whether this sum is or
is not the property of the republic.
Tliey juftify the attachment by fayingâ
The French Teized on Englilh Ihipsâthey re
taliate by seizing on French moneyâand the
question will be brought to iiTue by this means
between the two countries. It will be tried
before an Englilh jury.
The society of United Irilhmen h3ve enter
ed into very Tpirited resolutions on the tranf
a&ion relating to the confinement of the Hon,
Simon Butler, and Oliver. Bond.
Twenty-Sight French privateers have
been taken ami carried into England. The
Roman Catholic bill has parted the frifh Par
liamentâthere was a majority of 40 in the
H.rnie of Lords in favor of extending the

received at- New.York.. The Boston papers
further (late, that neither Klundert nor the hanks
of the Moerdyk were abandoned by the French
on the 23d of Marchâthat in the general a&ioti
on the* 181 h of March, the French loft 2,200
men; and the Auftrians 1,200; that the former
fought with great bravery, disputed every inch
of the ground,"and took their former station in

That Antwerp is reported'to have been evacu

infargerits taken with arms in their hands, (hall
be jsut to death within 24 hours ; and that those
taken without arms shall be carried before the
criminal tribunal, and put to death within 24
hours after their condemnation.
It.is too obvious to escape notice, that the
accounts of the several a&ions between the
French and the combined armies, are cori
fttjed and contradictoryâthe loss of the
Frfnch in 'the affair of the 18 th March, is
iUted-at 23D0, 2200, 7000, Sec. &c.âtime
â alone will determine the truth.
At to the important battle of the 22d of
IVJarch, the accounts are involved in great
uncertaintyâif not palpable, contradictionsâ
the reports are of a winged descriptionâand

From the general complexion of public as.
fairs in England, Scotland and Ireland, as de
lineated" in letters publi/hed in this country,
it appears that those kingdoms are by no
means in a ft&te of internal peace and tran
quility.
The manufacturers are in many places
thrtnvn out of employ in consequence of the
war, and the numerous bankruptcies which
have taken place.
' A spirit of suspicion, jealousy and intole-
MDce, in regard to the difcuflion of political
fubje&s, appears to actuate the government,
in confeqnence of which vexations prosecu
tions are instituted, and numbers of indivi
duals have heen fererely fined, and laid under
heavy bonds, and committed to plril'onâwhile
others have been outlawedâThat tliefe
things will end in troii !e, it does not require
the spirit at prophecy to determine.

" We fend you three dispatches
from Gen. Dumourier. By a let
ter from Gen. Miranda, we have re
ceived the difagreeabje intelligence
that Liege it occupied by the Auf
trians. It appeals happily, by ttoe
fame letter, that onr troops rallied
and are in a good fituarion. Gen.
Duinoui ier, in bis letters, consoles
us for the check experienced at Aix
]a-Chapelle, which rendered the
railing the siege of Maellricht ne
ceflary. " Unless the people abso
lutely lose their fenfcs," fays he,
" I cannot fee how 2{ or 30,000 men
can venture to pass the Meufe be
fore more than 50,000 united, who
for Tome days past have had no o
ther object than to defend that pas
sage. lam here engaged in two
sieges ; should they be prolonged,
I fha.ll not perfilt. I shall myfelf
join the army, and bring with me
a reinforcement of more 2p,000 men.
What has happened should give us
no uneasiness, provided we confine
ourselves for two weeks to a regu
lar defenfive system, which we shall
soon change into a terrible offenfive
one."
Roberfpierre, Lacroix and Dan
ton, complained of the treachery of
the Generals in. the affair of Aix la-
Chapelle ; and on a motion made
by them, the Convention decreed
that generals Stengel and Lanoue
should be brought to the bar to give
an account of their conduct, and
that (heir papers Ihould be sealed up.
The Marine Minirter informed
the Convention that the United
States of America in fraternal affec
tion towards the French Republic,
had celebrated her victories by re
peated fertilities.
The Convention decreed, that
rue vrrrntiteers <51 rtiÂ®
who had come to Paris, should re
tire to their refpe<ftive municipali
ties, and wait there till they might
be called out for military service
like other citizens.
On a report of the Colonial Com
mittee, the Convention decreed,
that the French Colonies are in a
slate of War, and that the civil and
military officers should concert with
the National Commiflionei's, and o
their orders ; that the regi.
ment of the Cape should be brought
back to France,-and resume its rank
in the line ; and that the free men
and natives of the country should
form themselves into legions and
free companies.
Lafource requested a modification
of the decree, for infliding capital
punishments on emigrants who re
turn to France. He said, that a
young girl 14 years of age,had been
sent to Paris by her parents who
were emigrants 1 and that accord
ing to law, (he was liable to lose
her head on the fcaffold. He mov
ed, therefore, that this barbarous
law in regard to children, should be
applicable only to those who were
aibove the age of twenty-one.
Thuriot proposed to suppress the
puriifhinent of death in regard to
female children only, but after a
longdebate the Convention decreed,
that no change should be made in
the law palled against emigrant!,
as far as it concerned male children ;
and that in regard to females, the
ptiniftiment (honld for the fir ft of
fence, be changed into tranfporta
tiwn from the -territories of the Re

Letter from the Jdminiftrators of
Mayenne and Loire.
Angers, March 17, 1790.
Reprrjentatives,
THE Department of Mayenne
Loire is in great distress, but it has
not loft courage.âThe diftri<st of
St. Floient experienced the firft
shock : it has been entirely destroy
ed.âThe treasury has been plun
dered, and the Patriots have been
either mafTacred or expelled by a
band of insurgents.
Various bodies of these banditti
are dilperfed in different quarters.
During the time that St: Floient was
ravaged,-one proceeded to the town
of Chenille, which soon experienced
the like fate.âCholet, the chief
place of the diftritft, being rich by
its manufactures and commerce, at
tracted the attention of these plun
derers, and notwithstanding the re
finance it made, it was obliged to
surrender.
Yefterday,at noon, an engage
ment took place/which was A ill fa
tal to the patriots. The insurgents
are now proceeding to Saumur, an
important city, the pofleflion Of
which will render them mailers of
the whole country. The counter
revolutionifts have all white cock
ades. They demand a Icing, and
that the emigrants shall be recalled,
she administrative bodies have se
cured 200 of them, and in order to
intimidate these villains,they think
it necefl'ary that the law proceed
ings should be shortened.

Letter from Gen. Dumitfrier.
Tireleinont, March 16.
" Citizen Minifler,
" I announce to' yon with the
greatest fatisfadtion, that the check
at Aix la-Chapelle, as far as it con
cerns the honor of the French arms,
has been repaired tliis day, in the
most brilliant manner. Yesterday
the Aurtiians attacked and took
Tirelemont, in which we had only
400 men. This great town not be
ing susceptible of any defence, and
being before the van guard, ported
on the five heights of Complichc.
Marshal Lamarche defended himfelf
with a courage and skill which sav
ed the French army, by giving dif
ferent divisions time to march to
his afliflance. A mirtake in the ex
ecution of orders might have car
ried alarm to Bruflels, and even to
Pari*. becauCe some bodies, in place
of repairing to their place of desti
nation, fell back, which might have
made tlie evil to be believed much
greater than it was.
" This morning I attacked Tire
leniont on the right and left with
a pare of the army, as the reft could
not come up. Gen. Valence com
manded the attack on the right, Mi
randa that on the left, and Egalite
that on the center. We carried the
town by main force, and went be
yond itjn pursuing theenemy,who,
in their turn, attacked us with much
boldness in the villages of Goide
fenhovere and Hawteinowder. The
army not only defended themselves
with the greateil firmnefs, but they
attacked with success in their turn
and night only put an end to the
combat, which continued witbotu
lntermiffion from yesterday noon,
till 7 o clock this evening.
" All the bodies of the army dis
played the greated courage. The
enemy also displayed much skill in
their manoeuvres, and on that ac
count 1 consider this affair as very
decisive for opinion. Several par
ties of the army were deprived, by
their d.fiance, of the honor of hav
ing a share in it J am perfuadetl
that the Prince de Cobourg will en
tertain esteem for the army of the
Republic. I cannot enter into any
particular detail, as I am obliged to
make preparations for to-morrow
1 shall only tell you that the Bth
regiment of infantry repulsed with
their bayonets, a charge by the dra
goons of Cobourg.

Even the strong caftleof Konigflein
could not withstand the continued
efforts of Pruflian valour ; and the
desperate refiiftance of the emi
grants at Maeftricht, with the Hea
dy oppofirion of the Dutch at Wil
liamftadt, have given a check to the
Gallic ardour,which they will scarce
be able to recover this campaign.
For Dumoorier, Cuftine, Miranda
and the other heroes of the Frepch
army, we (hall now hear of the
prince of Saxe Cobourg, CJairfait,
prince of Hesse, the prime of Brunf
wick, prince of Orange, &c. To
this fad reverse in the state of the
French affairs, it will nÂ«t be arro
| gance to fay, that the timely ariival
of the British forces has greatly con
tributed. Their unexpected ap
pearance on the Dutch coast, gave
frefh strength to Batavian valour ;
and though it cannot be said that
they have hitherto been engaged in
real adion, yet their pretence has
not been a little serviceable to the
Dutch, by inspiring them with new
courage ; and by taking the defence
of Dort, and other places imp their
hands, left the Dutch at leisure to
attend to more distant quarters
where the forces of the enemy
seemed to threaten the firlt attacks.
As to our seamen, never Happier

long and (harp fltftion.
On the 15th inft. the advanced
ports of the Imperial army had been
beat back from Tirlemont, which
was re-taken by the enemy : On
the 16th, M. Dumourier attempted
to pass the left wing of the Iniperi- '
al army : On the 17th, there was
a change of portion, and a briik
cannonade: On the 18 th, at 7in
the morning, M. Dumourier attack
ed the centre of the Imperial army,
but was repulsed : he was likewise
repulsed by the Imperial right wing;
but about 3 in the afternoon, M.
Dumourier's right wing penetrated
thro' the Imperial left wing, whose
cavalry was prevented from ma- .
nceuviing, the ground being inter
fered by dirches. The corps of
reserve, commanded by M. Clair
fayr, then decided the vidory. The
French retired in gOod order until
6 o'clock in the evening, when the
Imperial cavalry put them to the
rout.
The number killed and wounded
is variously reportedâlt is faidthat
the French have loft 53 pieces of
cannon.
