IN order to give color to a l i&ht in the K*-
ecurive to exercise the Le illative power
rÂ»: judging whether t-Jiere be a caute ot' war in
a public ftipulationâÂ»-two oilieV arguments
are fubjoinecl by the writer to that iaft exa
mined.
The-fiWHs- (imply this, " It is tbe right
and duty &f the Executive to judge of and in
terpret those aifities of rtuf treaties which,'
gfve to Fr'aivce particular privileges, in iwitr t
to Ha ejthtjc pHwUgrs" frail Which]
it is stated as a eonlctjjuenre,'that?
the Executive has Certain other amoiigj
which is the ri"hi in qu'ellion.' . , i
This aigqmeii? i? apfwe'ed Ivy a vcty, ott
vioiis diftipftion, lT|be si. ft l ight is. efrentittj
ti> she execu'ion ol the treaty as Â«t-late in opy
interferes witb.no riglic (nw'eftci) ijnj
another Department. The fei oncl is net ef-j
fcntial to the txecutinn of the treaty or, .any.
other law; on the .contrary tl>s article
which the riftht is Â«a,oiiOt a,s has
been jhcwn, from the very #ature of it be in
oW' 'fÂ«! as *-Uu* li'refe-j
of the XegSflarae ; and-- *11 ttx? Uws lo
be enforced by the Executive remain in the,
mean time precisely t'x- (aire, whatever bej
the disposition 01 judgment of the Executive,'
This J'ccond right wouM alio interfere with a;
right acknowledged to be in the Legislative
Department.
If nothing else could fugge# this diftintf inn
to tie writer, lie ought to have been reminded
of it by his own words k< in order to the en
forcement of those privi)eges''~was it in or
der to the er>/or cement of the article of guaranty,,
that the right is alcsibed to the Executive ?
The other of the two arguments i educes, it
felf into the flowing form : The Executive
h:ts the right to receive public Ministers; this
right includes the right of deciding, j.| the
cafe of i\ revolution, whether the new go
vernment fending the M'nifter, ought to be
recognized or not ; and this again, the right
to give or refufo operation to pre-cxltting
treaties.
The power of the Legiflaturi
v *r and judge of the causes for
one of tire ffioft express and explii
of the Conflituticn.
of tff'ctf it by ftraincrl inferences, a r
potuericar or lingular occurrence^naturally
warns the reader of" lorr.e 'inking fallacy.
The word > of the Constitution are " he (the
Prefide'nt) (hall receive Ambailadorr, other
public Ministers and CtÂ»t)fuls." I fliall not '
undertake to examine what would be the pie
cife extent and efiert of this funÂ£t on in various
cases which-famy may suggest, or which time
may produce. It will be more proper to ob
serve in g'-neral, and every car.did reader
wil) second the observation, that little if any
thing more was intended by the claule, than
to provide tor a part cular mrde of commu
nication,â¢*/Â»Â»Â«/// grown into a right among mo
dern nations ; by pointing out the depart
ment oftKf Government, inoflf proper tor the
ceremony of admitting public 1 Mi h i Iter s, of
examining their credentials, and of authenti
cating their title to the privileges anexed to
their cfi irafter bv the law of nations. This
being the apparent design of the Conilitution,
it would be highly improper to magnify the
function into an important prerogative, even
where no rights of otbsr departments could
be affecfted by it.
To (hew that the view here given of the
clause is not a new conitru<stion, invented or
(trained for a particular occaiiouâl will take
the liberty of recurring to the coteniporary
work already quoted, which contains the ob
vious and original gloss put on this part of the
Constitution by its friends ant! advocates.
4< The President is also to be authorised to
receive Arnbafladors and other public Minif
teâ¢Â«. This, though it has bien a rich theme
of declamation, is more a matter of
than of authority. It is a circninflance, that
will be without confcqup.cc in the adminidratiou
of the government, and it is far more con
venient that it (hould be arranged in this
manner, than that there (hould be a necefliry
for convening the Legiflatu.e or one of its
branches upon every arrival of a foreign Min
ister, though it were merely to rake the plate
of a departed Fed. yo!. 11-p. 237.

or the ueWne 1 . â¢ >fir n nt ; and ton.
right to rcfu'e to acknowledge a

rignt to refute a public Minilk r.
It is not denied that there may be ca r es in
which a refpeft to the general principles' of*
liberty, the eTentiai rights of the people, or
the over-ruling fcntimeiit* of hiundnitV,tifight
J'eqirie a government, whether new or o!d,
to be treated as an ; .llegitiina*-e tie -otifir..
Such are in facl cii 'culled and admitted by the
moil - approved authorities. But they are
great aj.d extraordinary cases, by no means
Submitted to so limited an organ of t!ie na
tional will as the Executive of the United
Stares; and certainly not to be b'oii !<f, by
any torture of wo# ds, within the right to le
ceive Ainbaiiadorj}.
That the authority of the Executive doe?
not extend to question. whether an exilting
government to be recognized or ncft,
w 11 it ill more clearly appeal from an ex nti
nation of the next infeience of tne-writer, to
wit, that the Executive has a rift'.t to gve or
refine a&ivity and operation to pre-jgxiftirig
trvSrie <f.
If the e be a principle that not to I-e
questioned within the Uuited States, it
that every nation has a right to aboliih an old
government and eftabliJh a new one. This
principle is not ojijy recorded in every public
archive, written in every American heart,
and scaled with the blood of a host of Ame
rican inarrvrs ; but is the only lawful tej;u i e
by which the United States hold tlieir exiit
ence as a nation.
It is a principle incorporated with t !- >e
above?, that govern merits a e eihiMiflicd for
the national good and arc organs of the na
tional will.
From these two principles results a third,
that featies formed by tfcic government, a*, e
treaties of the nation, unleis otherwiie ex
prefied i.rf the treaties.
Another roiifeqijenee is that a nation, by
the right of changing the organ of
its will, can neither disengage it ft If front the
obligations, not forfeit the benefits of ifs
treaties. This is a truth of vast importance,
and happily reus with fuftice.it firir.r.els on
its own authority. To silence or prevent ca
vil, I insert however, the following extracts ;
4% Since then iuch a treaty (a treary not per
-44 fonal to the fovereig") directly Teiates to
44 the body of the State, it fiibfntjs though the
44 form of the republic happens to be changed,
44 and though it fliould even transformed
44 into a monarchy-âFor the State aid thÂ«
44 nation are always the fame whatever r.-han
-4< ges are made in the t'oriu of the govern
-44 mentâand the treaty concluded with tie
44 nation, remains in force as long as the
t4 nation exists." Vattel, B. 11. Â§ 185 â
44 It follows that as a treaty, in twithftand
-44 ing t!ie change of a democratic govern
-44 ment into a monarchy, continues in force
44 with the new King, in like manner ; it a
44 monarchy becomes a republic, the treaty
44 made with the King does not expire on
44 that accou.it, un'efs it was manifeftly per
-44 fonal." Uurlam. part IV, c. IX, Â§ 16,
A; a change of government then makes no
change in rhe obligations or rights of the
party to a treaty, it is clcar that the Execu
tive can have i>o more right to fpfpend or
prevent tiie operation of a tieaty, on ;.ccount
of the change. than to suspend or prevent the
operation, where no such change has happen
ed. Nor can it have any more right to sus
pend the operation of a treaty in foice an a
law, than to suspend the operation of aay
other law. /To be continued.J

FROM THE LONDON GAZETTE,
Whitihiii, July 13. 1
THIS morning one of his Majes
ty's meflengeis arrived with a
difpatcb from Col. Sir James Mur
ray, Bart. Adjutant-General to the
forces under the command of his
Royal Highness the Duke of York,
to the Right Hon. Henry Dundas,
one of his Majesty's principal Secre
taries of State, of which the follow
.
ing is a cwpy.
" EjlrtuXy July 10, 1793.
"Si*,
" 1 HAVE the honour to acquaint
you, that the Governor of Conde has
thisd'ay consented to surrender that
place to the Imperial forces under
1 he command of t he Pi ince of Wir
temberg, by whom it has been block
ailed for fowe time past.
" The Auttrian troops are to be
put in immediate pofleflion of the
detached works, and of one of the
gates of the town (that leading to
Tournay). The garrison is to sur
render as prifoneis of war, and to
march out upon the 13th. The
othei article# of the capitulation ai e
not yet arranged.
" This is a conqpeft of the utmost
importance ; Conde being one ofjjte
llrongefl place* of this frontier, re
quiring but a small garrison forTtt
defence, commanding the naviga.
tion of the river Scheldt, and faci
litating any future operation.
" i have the honour to be,
With the gieatelt refpetft,
" Sir, your molt obedient,
" humble servant,
, " JA. MURRAY."
ESTREUX, July 10.
We havejuft now received intel
ligence that Conde surrendered by
capitulation, about one P. M. this
day. The whole garrison are made
prisoners of warâthey amount to
between IS and 18 hundred inen fit
for service ; the reft are in thehof
pitals, where every assistance is now
giving them, as they were in abso
lute want of both provisions and
medicines. Thus has Conde fallen,
after standing a three months block
ade, at the commencement of which
the garrison amounted 10 4,000 men,
one half of *Vhom are now sick.â
The surrender of this town opens
to us the Scheldt, as tar as Valen
ciennes. It befidesaffords us a pro
per place for eltablifhing magazines,
and will enable us to lend a rein
forcement of troops to the army be
fore Valenciennes.
BARCELONA, June 9
Our fleet, confiding of 27 Ihips of

this port again, and put 011 shore
1200 Frenchmen, made prisoners in

alter which the fleet set fail again
for its further destination.
The Spanilh fleet, partly at sea

frigates of 34 gunsâbesides a great
number of other armed veflels, in
all 136 veflels, carrying 5,736 guns,
and 44.381 men.
This fleet was fitted out at Ferrol,
Cadiz, and Carthagena. The Chefs

" In official reports of the

the lofies were ellimated according

to a more exai r t review, it appears
that the loss on our fide was only

HAVRE, June 29.
Vicc Admiral Truguei has written the follow
ing letter to the National Convention :
" Three months have palled, and F.urope,
astonished, asks what ha* become of the marine
and the teamen of France ? Our Levant trade is
nearly ruined ; the contagion of insubordina
tion inercafes, and" our enemies cruize on our
coails, and threaten us. How can we bear the
idea of even the momentary fupt riority ot the
Spaniards ?âWhat fliame for a Republican
heart, for a Fieneh sailor !
" Citizen Piefident, I ought to tell you the
truth: We have the moll imposing force, the
best fhipsin the world, excellent Teamen, who
burn with patriotism and courage ; but I know
not what lethargy prevents the execution of the
plans which I have proposed. An invisible
ariftocraGy maintains in our ports a criminal agi
tation, which difgraccs and rums us. Thunder.'
over the guilty. Discipline is the ficft law of
armies: the naval force of Toulon know n
It iiobediencc which ensures success
I am ready to die for my country ; but I would

an handful of men, do againll so many power

the olive-branch of negociation. 1 *
On the Bth instant, the committee of public
welfare of the National Convention, otherwise
called Marat's committee, was impeached in the
Jjcobin Club. Chabot said, there were but
three honest men in that committee, all Partizans
of the Mountain, viz. jeanbon St. Andre, St.
Just, and Couthon.
The council general of the commons insist on
the contingents being furnifhed by the [eÂ£liona;
and their obstinacy may occasion serious dillur-
ban ces.
The departments advance their forces againA
the capital, and several other provinces join the
the league. That of La Manche is on the poifit
of declaring itfelf in a state of infurte&ion. The
townj of Carentan and St. Loo, have hgnificd
their "with to march to Paris.
At Coutance they talk of supporting the Mo
derates.
A focicty under the name of the Charabots(a
word fynonimous to that of Sans Culottes) has
been established. It consists of 700 members,
who all profefs the fame principles as the depart

The waggons of the army on the coasts set off
from Caen this day, laden with bread & flower,
for the army of the departments at Evreux.
The forces of the department of Isle and Vi
laine put themselves on their march on the 6*h
instant. That of Port l'Orient has reached
Caen ; the central aflembly at Caen has publith
ed a proclamation, that their forces only go to
Paris to fraternize with the Parisians, and to ce
ment the tottering llatue of liberty.
The camp of Weiflenbourg was struck on the
3d instant, and removed to the distance of
leagues from Landau. The whole line is oit %
deep eminence, which commads the surrounding

Deputies sent from the city of
Vernon, denounced theAdminiftra

e?cpofed the wretched si; uation of
Vernon, on account of the Counter
Revolutionary Army, which was
only two leagues from that city.
The following letter from Ver

read :
" For three days the tocsin has

A member observed, that he was
surprised at the indifference of the
Parjfians at the bad news received
from La Vendee. "Then (said he)
the enemy were ar 60 or 80 leagues
from Paris; but at piefent, when
they are'at Vernon, 16 leagues only
from Paris, I ca:uiot conceive why
they fiiould be so tranquil. Will

termined, that the Members of the
Council should lepair to their Sec

given by the Deputies of Vernon,
and to invite the Citizens to take
efficacious measures. When they
were on the point of repairing to
their Sections, they were prevented
by the arrival of three Deputies ot
the Committee of Public Safety of
the Convention, who came to con
firm the disagreeable news from the
Department of Eure ; and to en
gage the Parisians to fly to the suc
cour of their brethren. They have
been led astray, said the Speaker, by

that Louis was affaflinated without being

Commerce by fr.a was suspended, and almo ft all
the merchant Ydfds arc converted into priva
teers; the prices which they take are innumera
ble, and have filled their ports with abundance
of property. Their frigates were frequently
engaged at the beginning of the campaign, in
which the French manners have ihevvn the
greatest bravery in the different a&ions. Their
enemies have done juilice to their valour,but af
fedt to believe that the fleet has not been fuffi
ciently exercised to acquire that knowledge of
naval tallies, which {hall render them a match
for that of the enemyâEvents have proved the
contrary. The divisions of Brest and Rochefort
being united to the number of 27 fail of the line
have compleatly beaten the fleets of England
and Holland. âMeantime the fleet from Tou
bate froftrated the deiigns of the Spaniards
on thsÂ£r coall and against Corsica.
Our armies by land have been equally fuccef
ful ; the Austrians have quitted Valenciennes,
being obliged to raise the siege, after a great
many vigorous forties, in which we are allured
they lost above 10,000 men, and their general
the Prince de Cobourg.. The siege of Lille is
likewise raised.
The army of the Royalists in Britanny is en
tirelo defented, and they hope that Bernard La
rigny, who commanded it, will soon fall into
the hands of the Republicans, who will not fail
to shave hint with the national Razor.
The publishers of the foregoing articles, call

" I mud refer you to the papers for public

near at hand. We have had no failures of
confoquence for some time past, and I think
the want of money and confidence to subside.
Your friends are getting upâl can with great
truth alfure you, our government and the

cultivate harmony with your States, and I
sincerely hope, that the rage for privateering
may not interfere."

" The blacks and mulattoes continue in
arras, and ast in concert with the white
troops under the command of the Commit!"-,
aries who at piefent govern the Cape ; but
you may fudge of the strength or permanen
cy of the government when you are infomied
that by far the greater parr of the people in
arras are the negroes from tiie plantations
who made the firft infurreftionâand these
a-e now emancipated. The firft Officers at
t'ie Cape, and many other places, next to che
Commiifaiies arc mulattocs; <lhite people
a r e go n3 out of fa.liioi', and the black ai d
brown are in vogue.âWe may therefore con
clude from the conduct of the Cornmilfaries,
and the complexion of the prelent rulers
(though the Commiifaiies are bat cyphers)
that the Island will contmue under a black
government. The white troops, mulattoes
and negroes at the Cape, and the mountain
negroes are no more at enmity, their cause
has become oneâthe found of imcrty Â»s
echoed every part of the Island.â
The situation of the virtuous Frenchmen
here is truly lamentableâand must force a
tear from every good American, who knows
not only the value of Liberty, but of a good
government to protest it."
The Governor's Speech, at the opening tiie
feflion of the Legislature of tuis Common

United States.
The following is the Aufwer of the House
of Representatives :â
To THOMAS MfFFLltf
Governortj the Commonwealth oj Pemfylvaniu.
TO the citizens of Pennfylvauia, whose
agriculture and commerce are the chief sour
ces of their public and private prufperity, the
necessity of prefer ving towards the belligerent
nations of Europe a system of the pnreft neu
tral tv, mill} be as obvious as it is important.
A ftri(st adherence to the treaties connect
ing us with fame, and an exist oblervance of
those duties, which by the laws and customs of
nations, we owe toall the contending parties,
can alone, in our opinion, at once prefervs
our neutrality, and maintain the dignity of
our governmentâche steps taken by the exe-
tlje Union ill this critical junftuie,
been grounded on thole prin-
not only our sincere and
unanimous approbation, bur, unless we are
deceived, in their sentiments, we speak Hie
aim ill universal voice of our condiments.
Influenced by thafrfentiments, we are hap
py to find, that oil several occasions, which
have recently occuried, you have with equal
promptitude and finnnefs,feconded the efforts
ofthe general government,in repressing every
infringement ofthe rights of neutrality ; nor
can we avoid expressing our confidence, that
a perseverance in that line of conduct which
has hitherto been purfucd, will continue to us
the friendlhip of Europe, and secure to our
country the bleflings of peace.
Having already experienced the calamities
peculiarly incident to the progress of savage
warfare, we cannot fufficiently deprecate the
continuance or renewal of them ; but flii,uld
the endeavors made on behalf of the United
States to conciliate the hostile Indians, prove
unfuccefsful, we doubt not, that every just
and necessary exertion will I>e made by Penn
sylvania to aid the operation of the general
government, and afford effe&ual prote&ion to
her own citizens.

GERARDUS WYNKOOP, Speaker.
From the Baltimore Daily Repository
THE late attempts to misrepresent the sense
of the people, on certain important poliiicai
fubjefts, fiirnifh matter for much lenous reflec
tion. Shbrtly alter the appearance of the pro
clamation declaring the neutrality of the Unijed
States, it was boldly aflerted, that the President
had no right to ilTue it, and that he had milia
ken his duty, the sense of the treaties, and the
intered of the United States. When the mer
chants of -forne towns addrefled him, approbat
ing the declared neutrality, it was (aid they
were only a few tories, British merchants, and
court sycophants : And now ihat addreHes and
resolutions can no longer bear such a com
ment, endeavors are not wanting to pet fuade the
people, that it comports more with their duty
to be Client.
Mr. Fenno,
SOME personS have exprefled their sur

which appeared in the National Gazette ot"

But why express the least surprize ?
It is in courje such fumes arise ;
