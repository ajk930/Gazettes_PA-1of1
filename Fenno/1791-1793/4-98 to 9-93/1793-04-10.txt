NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Saturday, January 19.
A LETTER was received from
Manuel, complaining of the
condadi e-f the Convention, from
whom, he (aid, a diforderfy band,
by the Pole talent ofmakiHg anoife,
took away all power of doing good.
By your conduct, continued he, you
have expo fed FrAnfe, and tuch as
,you are (the truth eTcapes me) yes,
I'ucfe as yeu are, yon cannot save it.
He concluded with giving in his re
signation, as having it no longer irt
; U.is power to be trfeful at his port.
He henceforth proposes by his writ
ings and examples, to devote hitn
felf to the education of children, as
the Resolution wants nothing but
| men.
On the qiieftien* " Shall there, or
Jhall t-hire not, be a delay rn the
ntecution of the King ?
tondorcet â>" Let us prove to the
whole world that we arÂ« nt>t barba

death of the tyrant, we wish alfofor
the happirtefs of mankind. Let uÂ»
lit ike the ci-devant king, but let us
abolish the punilhment of death for
all privaie crimes, and refei ve it
only for treason, Let us hasten to
revise our system of taxation, to es
tablish beneficent laws, to fh r hl a
fvflem of public inftruJtiflii, and t-Â»
meliorate the management of our
lrofpitals. We may thenanfwer \y

out, in a time like the present, the
feeble ought to be silent, and leave
to the more courageous to speak.]
1 do not believe, continued Petion,
that this discourse is addreii'ed to
me. [Several voices calledâit is.]
It is not, relumed Pet ion, an alli
ance between the friends of liberty
and thofeoftyranny which 1 lie/ire ;
the alliance is impossible ; 1 demand
freedom of opinion, tranquility and
confidence ; I demand that there be
no denunciation without proof. If

has perhaps done some services to

losing his head. 1 declare for the

exposed tnyfelf for the public, and
that I wijl do it still. Astothefaft
citcd by Tburiot, I am aftoniflied
that he did not mention all the cir
cumstances before the deputation
reached my house; the mifchief
was irreparable and already known
to all the world. The fatft quoted
by Collot is equally incorrect. I
have not printed vague calumnies,
my opinions still remain. Collot
may attack them. There are still
other accusations to be made against
roe ; 1 know that two members of
this Aflembly have been fufficiently
abandoned to spread a horrid re
port ; I expect irom them a denun
ciation without fear, Returning to
the still more important difcullion,
in which we are engaged, I vote a

city already deserted."
PROCLAMATION
Of theProvifional Executive Council,
January 20, 1793, Second Year of
the Republic.
The ProvifionalExecutive Council
deliberating on the mealures to be
taken for the execution of the de
crees of the National Convention of
the ijth, 17th, 19th and 20th of Ja

regulations :

2d. The place of execution, fliall

3d. Louis Capet fliall set out from

place at noon, - â* â
4th. The Commjlfioners of the

and members of the tribunal, as Coon
as the execution is over, (hall come
to give an account to the Council,
wbo" fliall continue in a state of per
nianent fitting, during tlie whole
day.
By the Provisional Executive Council,
ROLASD, CLAVIERE, MOUSE,
LE BRUN, GARAT, PACHE.
The Proclamation of the Provisi
onal Executive Council, relativi to
his execution, bad hardly been no
tified to Louis before he requeued
perniiffion to confer with his family.
The commiSsioners testifying tlcir
embarraftinent at this requett, jro
pofed to hiin that his family lhould
be brought into his apartment, to
which he agreed. His wife, hiifif
ter, and his children accordingly
came to bim and they conferred
together in the room in which fie
was accudomed to dine. This in
terview laded two hours and An
half; their conversation was tery
earned.
We may conceive what must haTe
been the nature of .the sceneâbut
a narrative of it is impoflible, for we
do not take rhe Commil{ionei;s { of
the Commune to be very faitbfol or
very feeling historians. Rumour,
however fays, that the Queen had
been for lome days ip a (late of dif
fractionâthat at times her mind
was totally absent, and fliewastobe
roused from lethargy to a sense of
her sorrows. All that we can fay
upon this authority is, that the King,
after this interview, waited for. his
fuinmons without the least symp
tom of dismay.
The King wiflied to cut off Hs
hair; fciflars were refufed himâ
they took away his knife.â" Fools!
(said he) to think I would bafelf
turn my hand againft'my own life !
His famijy asked, whether the'
might not fee him again in the
morning? to this he made no an
swer, and Madam Elizabeth saw liin
no more. Louis cried out of hit
chamber, " Oh the murderers ! th<
murderers !"
Addreffingherfelf to their fon,An>
toineite fa idâ" Learn by the uilf
fortunes of yonr father, not to Â»
venge his death
The Princess, whose critical age,
joined with her fuffei ings, had bi o'l
her into the inoft pitiable state, re
ceived, as we understand from one
of the Paris Journals, the facramert
on the fame day ; and ber life was
despaired of. Our readers will raj*
that we can only give these parti
culars on questionable authority.
Arrived at the fatal fpor, the un
fortunate monarch mounted the
fcaffold alone, tlie Commilfioners,
the Mayor, and even his Confeffor,
remained at the foot of it. He had
on nothing but a white under waift
coar, his neck and bread open, and
his hair rolled up as the Abbes wear
theirs.
As he placed himfelf upon the
Guillotine, he raid, " I commit n>y
foul to God."
LONDON, Jan. 38,
The purport of the commnnicatir.
on fro,m the Spanish Envoy, whiph
ilie French Convention refuted to
hear, before pronouncing sentence
on the late King, was to entreat the
Convention to suspend the judgment
of Louis 5 and to offer,if the Envoy
were allowed time, to fend a couri
er to Madrid, to obtain a promise
from the King of Spain of becoming
a Mediator between France and her
enemies, and to engage them tpdif
arm and acknowledge the Republic,
on condition that the life of the
head of the house of Bourbon should
be saved.
Thomas Paine, it is said, had po
fnive inltru&ions from President
Washington, in America, Co infill
on the fafety of the King's person,
and that if the French would not
permit him to remain in France, to.
fend him there, as they could not
forget the kindness be had fliewp ,
them.
.At Lyons, a few days part, twelve
Priests were beheaded. One of them
made a temporary efc pe, by run

REPORT OF BRISSOI - ON THE CON
DUC f of ENGLAND towards
F R A N C E.
THE Court of England wiflics for Warâthe
ho>>echeri(hed by thole who regard with horror
a WW between two free nations is now no more
the hottiie views of the Court of London are
at lall difcovercd. A perfidious mask of neu
trality (till covered them. Your republican
lirmneftihas caused that maik to fall off.
GEORGE has debauched the opinion of the
English nation 5 he has disturbed commerce, he
has given orders to parliament; he has menaced
the Oiinifters, and upon this coalition, he now
â¢declares war against you, becauK he believes the
moment arrived when he may vHth Tafety and
impuDity'employ hrt farces against your liber
ty ; he has declared war againttyou hy ordering
your anibaffador to depart from England within
tight days ; he has declared it by publicly tefti
iying marks of sorrow for the Tate of the confpi
rutor, whom you had jullly condemned to pu
niflmient; he has declared: it by demanding
from parliament, upon the intelligence of his
death, a cenliderable addition of forces by land
and sea. To dil'miL ignorainibufly the agent of
the republic, and to arm, on the intelligence of
the death of the traitor, is it not to fay to Eu
rope, to the universe, France lias condemned
Louisas a traitor, and I believe him innocent,
I lie in France only febeis and Sacrilegious per
sons? France no longer wifnes for a king or
royalty! and ' wifhto avenge the king and roy
alty ?> RithÂ«r may 'England perilh than behold
the eftablifcment of the French republic i
Such is the barbarous wilh of the King of
Great j Ãritain, if he did not immediately and o
penly declare war against you, it was because
his Mtniftry (iid not second with efficient afti-
Vity, his Orders of vengeance, because his forces
â were not-vcr to-deftroy our commerce,
to take from ua our colonies, to ravage our
country. Undoubtedly if the English people had
not allowed themselves to yield to the forcible
ampulfe of the Miniflry, they would have con
sidered the offences, with which we are re
proached, only, as the crimes of individuals;
they wouljl have regarded the punishment of
Xibuis as a great a& of jiiftice; andj convinced
of these truths, would have been of opinion,that
to declare war again & us, becauie we do not
wilh for a king, would be an a& of injustice,
and a violation of the law of nations* and that
we might havecontinued to have been brothers,
though under a different form of government^-
Such, without.doubt, is the sentiment of a
great part of the Engliih, and which would have
already difplayedr jtfelf, if it had not
the terror of bayonets; but the English nation
â once'Â« enlightened by our exauu>W at
<io juflice dnju^^sT oo Â«* confplrators in
pi TTTeurce of the eternal Trial of Haf
efhg* will not be renewed, and fcaffolds will
once more be of use for the Staffords and Lauds
of the government, as well a$ for private ruf-
â 1
- Citizens it would not be proper to dissemble
from you the dangers of the new war ; we
have all the tyrants of Europe to combat by
land and sea. All ihe people alone are our al-
lies; but thcfe people are nothing to you, for
they arc in chains, and those chains must firft
be broken. Ail your means then must depend
upon yourfeJVei alone. Your foil, your indu
ilry, your courage, must supply what nature
and circumstances refufe you.
The trader, forgetting his commerce, must
"become a warrior, those who have capitals must
employ their funds to support our affigaats, and
supply the want of money, the proprietor of
land and labourer, renouncing all fpcculation,
must furnifli the means of abundance during
the operations of the war, every citizen, like a
Roman soldier, must march, not only with his
arms, but with provisions for a given time, and
thus you will-defeat the calculations of your
enemies with relpcdt to the emptiness of your
magazines. The great family of Frenchmen
muil conipofe only one army, and all France
must form only one camp, where nothing b t
War is talked'"ofâwhere nothing is pursued
but War. Above all, you must expeSi distress,
Mid prepare yoUrselves for fuffering every fpeci
cs of want ; (hortly indeed, it must be a crime
for a citizen to have a change of clothing, if
(here is one of our brothers who is destitute of
lovering.
To declare that France is at war with Eng
land is like wife to declare war against the Stad
iolder of Holland. The Stadholder, vrho is ra
tfler the fubjedfc than the ally of the court of St.
lanits's, whÂ® has been, and still is, a passive in
-1 rument in their hands, who, in subservience to
til their inclinations, has in the course of the
'evolution favoured the emigrants and the
Prufllans, harraffed the French, and treated with
nfolcnce the French government. 1 here allude
o the circumstances of releasing the persons
ruilty of forging aflignats, arretted in Holland.
l"he Stadholder arms in the mean time to fup
>ort the war of the Court of joins his
sups to the Englith fleec, favours our enemies

tee of general defence has chargcd trie to pre
sent to you the plan of the following decree.
DECREE.
" The National Convention, after having
heard the report of their Committee of Cieiie
ral Dcfence, in the c> ndu<3 Â«f the Engliih go
vernment.
" Conlldcrinp thst the king of Eiiglaudhas
perfiftcd, especially since the revolution of the
iothof Aug. 179 a, to give proofsof his being
evil difpofcd toward* the French nation, and of
hit attachment to the coalition of crowned
heads.
" That at the period aforefaid. he ordered his
amhaflavor at Paris to withdraw, bccaufe he
would not acknowledge the proyiGonal e*eciÂ»-
tive council, created by the afl'eiubly.
" That the Cabinet of S(L James's hadceal'ed,
since the fame period, to coriefpond with the
French ambassador at London, on pretext of the
suspension of the heretofore king of the French.
" That since the opening of the National
Convention, it has it.fufcd to resume the usual
correfpondcnce between the two states, and lo
acknowledge the powers of this convention.
" That it has refufed to acktio jvledge the am
bassador of the French republic, altho' provided
with letters of credit in its name.
" I'hat it has endeavoured to impede the dif
ferent purchasers of corn, arms and other com
modities ordered in England, either by French
citizens or the agents of tile republic.
"That it has caused to be (topped several
boats and ihips loaded with grain fÂ«r France,
contrary to the treaty of 1786, whils exporta
tion to other foreign countries was free. ~.
"That in order still more effectually to.ob
ftru& the commercial operation of the republic
in England.it obtained an a&of parliÂ»ment,pro
hibitingthe circulation of affiguats.
'â¢ That in violation of the 4th article of the
treaty of 1789, it obtained another a<St, ir. the
month of January last, which fubje<Sts all Flench
citizens reltding in or coming into Englani, to
forms tlie most inquisitorial, vexatious and dan
gerous.
" That at the fame time, and contraiy to~rie
lft article of the peace of 1783, it granted pn
te&ion and pecuniary aid not only to the emi
grants, but even to the chiefs of the rebels, win
have already fought against France ; that it hjs
maintained with them a daily correfpondcnu,
directed against the French Revolution; th*
it has also received the chiefs of the rebels of the
French Well-India Colonies;
" That in the fame spirit, without any pro *
vocation, and when all the maratime powersare
at peace with England, the Cabinet of St. James
has otjdered a confidenible naval armament, and
an augmentation of the land forces.
" That this argument was ordered at a mo
ment when the British Minister was bittarly
pcrfccuting those who supported the principles
of the French Revolution iaEnglaud, and has
employing ail poflible means, both in Parlia
ment and outof it, to cover the French Repub
lic with ignomy, and to draw upon it the exe
cration of the Engliih nation, and of all Europe.
Â«* That the Ã¼bjeft of this armament, intend
ed again# France, was not even disguised in the
Engliih Parliament.
" That although the Provilional Executive
Council of France has employed every measure
for preserving peace and fraternity with the
Englifli nation,and has replied to calumnies and
violation of treaties, only by remonflrances
founded on the principles of justice, and expref
fcd with the dignity of free men, the Englifli
Minifler has persevered in his system of male
volence and hostility, continued the armaments,
and sent a squadron to the Scheldt, to disturb
the operations of the French in Belgium.
" That, on the news of the execution of Lou
. is, he carried his outrage* to fhÂ«!F*fench Repuh?
lie to such a length, as to order the Ambaflador
of France to quit the Britilh territory within
eight days.
" That the King of England has manifefted
his attachment to the cause of that traitor, and
hisdefign of supporting U by different resoluti
ons adopted at the moment of his death, both
by nominating generals of his land army, and
by applying to parliament for a considerable ad
dition of land and sea forces, and putting Ihips
of war in commiflion.
" That his secret coalition with the enemies
of France, and particularly with the Emperor
and Pruflia, is confirmed by a treaty concluded
with the firft in the month of January; that he
has drawn into the fame coalition the Stadthold
er of Holland; that that Prince, whose servile
obsequiousness to the orders of *he courts of St.
James and Berlin, is but too well known, has in
the course of the French revolution, and not
withstanding the neutrality which he profeffed,
treated with disdain the agents of France, receiv
ed the emigrants, harraffed the French patriots,
counteia&ed their operations, released, in oppo
fition to cftablifhed usage, and notwithilanding;
the demand of the French Miniver* persons who
had been guilty of forging aflignats; that in the
mean time, with a view to concur in the hos
tile defigus of the court of London, he gave or
ders for a naval armament, named an Admiral,
appointed Dutch ships to join the Englifti fleet,
opened a loan to defray the expences of the war,
put a stop to exportations to France, while he fa
voured fending fupphes of provision tothePrui
fian and Austrian magazines."
Considering, in fine, that all these circumftai
ces no longer leave to the French Republic a*y
hope of obtaining, by means of amicable
ciation, the redress of their grievances, and fhat
all the ads of the Britilh court, and of the Stadt-
holder of the United Provinces, are a<sts of hos
tility, equivalent to a declaration of war. The
National Convention decree as follows :
Article I. The National Convention declares
in the name of the French nation, that, consi
dering the multiplied afis of hostility and ag
greflion of the above mentioned nations,
THE FRENCH NATION IS AT WAR WITH
THE KINO OF ENGLAND AND THE
STADTHOLDER OF THE UNITED PRO
VINCES.
11. The National Convention charges the Pro
visional Executive Council to call forth such for
ces as may appear to thera nccefiary for repel
ling their aggrcGion, and for maintaining the in
dependence, the dignity and the interefh of the
French Republic.
111. The National Convention authorises the
Provisional. Executive. Council to dispose of the
naval forces of the Republic in such a manner
as the intcrelU of the Hate may appear to them
to require; and it revokes all particular difpofi-
tions ordered in this refpejl by preceding de-
creeb.

and that the Convention would decree that all

and 10 he a mother to them, if they Ihould have
the miifnrruoe to lose their own.
" I entreat my wife to forgive me all the evils
whjch (he fuffers on my accounr, and the unea
siness Which I may have caused her in the cou/fe
ot our union ; as she may be a flared, that I re
member nothing against her, it Die thinks (he
has any thing 10 icproach her fell with.
~u j earncflly recommeud to my children,next
to thei< duty to God, whtch they ought to pre
fer to cvt ry thing, to maintain mutual union,
fubmitlion and obedience to their mother, and
â¢gratitude for all the cares which Ihe incur! for
them, and in memory of me.
44 I entreat them to consider my lifter as
a second mother. I recommend to my son,
if he fhou'd have the misfortune to become
King, to think that he owes himfelf entirely
to the good of his fellow-otizens j that be
ought to forget all hatred and all retentment,
and especially whatever relates to the misfor
tunes and uneasiness which I experience |
tli* he cannot promote the good of the pub
lic but by reigning according to the laws;
but, at the feme time, that a King cannot
make the laws refpefted, and do the good he
wither, but in proportion as he has the ne
cea'ary authority ; and that, without this, be
in; fettered in his operations, and inspiring
no refpeft, he is more injurious than nfeful.
I recommend to my son to take care of all
the persons who were attached to as far
las his eircumftances Ihall give him the means;
to think that this is a sacred debt which I
have contracted to tbe children or relation?
of those who have died for me, and Hl*kv., to
those who are unfortunate on my } a< count.
I know that tlie.e arc many jpeffoosW those
who were attached to me, who have not coii
durted themselves towards me as they ought,
and who have even (hewn me ingratitude;
but I forgive them in the moments of
trouble and effervefcerrce, a man is not mas*
ter of himfelf) ; and I entreat my for, if he
should have the opportunity, to rememberoli
ly their misfortunes. 1 Could wife to he able
to teftify my gvatitute to thole who have dis
played a true and difintereC.ed attachment Â»o
me. On the one hand, if I was (enfibly aff:<Tc
ed by the ingratitude and difloyaftv or periods
to whom I had never (hewn any thing but fa<-
vor to them, their relations, or friends ; on
the other, J have had the consolation off lec
'ing the voluntary attachment *Â».d interest
which many persons have, shewn to me. I en
treat them to accept of my thanks ; in the ii
tuation in which things still are, I should he
afraid of bringing them into danger, if I were
to speak more explicitly ; but 1 recommend
particularly to my son to seek ail occasions of
discovering them.
4< I lhould, think that I ca
lumniated the sentiments of the nation, did I
not openly recommend to my Ton M. M. da
Chamilly and Huet,whofe true attachment to
me induced them to (hut â¢ themselves up with
me in this mournful relidence, and who were
near being the unhappy vt&ims of what they
did. I also recommend to him Clerl, with
whose attention I have had every reason to be
fatisfied since he has been with me. As it is
he who has remained with me to the last, I
request M. M. of tlie Commune, to deliver to
him my clothes, my books, mi watch, #\y
purse, and the other little etfe&s which Have
been deposited at the Council of the Com
mons.
M I also moil willingly forgive /hose who
guarded me, the ill treatment /nd severity
which they thought it their dut/ to make me
fufFer. IJiave found some fc/ling and com
passionate fouls; may they efjoy the tranqui
lity of heart, wbich ought fpviug from their

and the expreifion of ijiy sensibility, sots all thft
care and all the pain/which they tOolr'for me.

Yeftorday arrived here the ftiips George
Barclay, Capt. Cotfet and Harmony, Cap'.
Ofman from London âalso the Adrianna,
Capt. Robert pin from Liverpool; the Adrian
na left Liverpool the JJth February.âlt was
reported there, that Gen. Dumourier had had
a battle with the Auftrians and Prussians, and
iTacl totally defeated themâin confluence
of which army had entered Hol
land ; another report is that a body of the
Dutch forces had been defeated.âAccounts
by the. abovs arrivals state that the Britiih
and French cruisers fwarra on the coalls of
France and England-r-that various captures
had been made by the French and Englifliâ
and that the American flag was unmolelled.
Capt. Collet met with two Britifti frigates on
his pafTage âby the Captains of which he was
treated with the greatest politeness. We do'
not find that the account of the execution
of the Queen of France is confirmed by these
arrivalsâand conclude it is premature.â
The George Barclay has brought a large num
ber of paiTengerj.
Various reports were circulated yesterday,-
among othersâThat the American Minister
at the Court of London had given that Court
aflurances of a drift neutrality in the present
war between Great-Britain and France, on
the part of the United States. Another re
port is, that a French cruiser had chaced a
British velTcl into Norfolk, Virginia. Time
will fix the authenticity orfaifeliood of the va
rious rumours of the day.
The fchooncr Frederickfburg Packct, An.
derfon, arrived here on Monday last from
Malaga.
Capt. Anderfon put into Gibraltar on the
23d Feb. where he received the following ad
vices :âThat the French Republic had de
clared war against Great-Britain and Holland
âthat the late Queen of France had been ,
tried and executed at Paris about the 10th of
Feb. and that the Algerines had declared war
against Holland, Denmark, fend Sweden.
Several British ships of war were cruising
in the Streights, to protest the English and
Dutch ihips from the French and Algerine
cruiTeu, and to convoy them into Gibraltar,
where 3 Durch (hips had already arrived.
Major Nathan Goodall,.of Bellepte, on the

THE L'uiieJ Su<es of America,
i"iyÂ» the Citizen DÂ«eher, owe |
ro Frwice man)' iÂ»ill-iosn of money.
1 (hewed long ago means for facili
tating the recovery of that debt, a
debt which is the most legitimate a
nation could have contracted.
In the year I 785, i wrote, " I hat
General Sullivan offered to pay the.
iiiare New-l!anipftiire bears in the
American National debt due to
France, in timber, mails, boats, and
l'alt beef.
In the year n$Q, 1 proposed that
the debt there, fhoold be paid in
proportion to the conftitntion of that
eonntry ; and as the United Stares
could not pay the debt in specie, I
proposed that each itaie should pay
off that debt in the productions of
their Coil, transported to fiance in
their bottoms, which would he tne
more beneficial to thein, as those ar
ticles mult rife in the value by such
exportation.
In order to interest all the Ame
rican states in the mode of payment,
I ihHik we ought to accept of the
productions ot the northern, cen
tral, and finithern states ; namely,
in timber, (Mt beef and pork, corn,

piovifions.

IRELAND.
" ip ou4B0u4B of Lords, Jan. 10.
The Ho"fe unanimonfly agreed
to a dutiful and loyal Â»ddreft to his
Maiefty, on the speech of the Lord
Lieutena,nt to bo.ili H,oufes of Paili*
anient. '
The House likewise agreed to a.n
add reft of thanks to tbe Loid Lieu
tenant, tbe F>uk(? of Lejutter being
the only difleiuient.
In th<? cftuiff of the debate, the
Lord Chancellor took notice of the
petition pi efented to his Majesty
from tbe Catholics of Ireland,which
},e reprobated in very severe terms,
on account of the many misrepre
sentations and unfounded allegati
ons contained in ir ; and declared
his intention, Ihould befland alone,
to oppose any bill which fliould be
brought forward, for a total re-eal
of the popery laws of that kingdom.
Â« No man," said hi* Lordship, "is
more ready than 1 am to enter cool
ly and di'fpaflionately into the na
ture of their claims. Ido most fo
-lem lily protest, that as an individu
al I never have, ner will I evpr en-
quire, what may be the religion of
any wan ; if he be an honest man.
\Â»lratfoe*er his religion may be, u
Jh*ll never influence uie in aiy pri-
vate dealing ; and the more zcalouf
ly any man is attached to any reli"
gion which heprofefles, the greater
confidence ihall I always be inclined
to put in him. But we all know
the influence which religion has u
niforntly had upon the political go
vernment of every nation in Europe,
and it is iu this point of view alone,
in wbicW > vrill ever consider the
claims of" the Catholics in thisHoofe.
If there be a clause in the statute
book which restrains their religious
worshipâis there be a clause which
renders their charaifiets, their pet
lons, or their properties, less secure
than the characters, tlie perfoiis,. or
the properties of Proceftants, let it
be repealed ; but, if any roan can
be so wild as to look to a total re
peal of the Popery laws of this king
dom âif any man can be so wjld as
to desire to communicate 'he effici
ent power of a free Protestant go
vernment, to a great majority of
the people of Ireland profetfing the
Popish religion, I do not fcrople to
fay, that it is an abl'urd and a wick
ed speculation. lam fatisfied that
as long as the nature of man conti
nues to be what it is, it is utterly
impossible that a zealpus Catholic
can exerclfe the efficient powers of
government, in support of her <on
neftion with the Protestant empire
of Great-Britain : and therefore,
if I am the single man in Ireland to
raise my voice against such a pro
jetft, I will resist it It is not to the
people who profefs the Catholic r*-
ligion that I look upon thisoCcafioi,
it is to the principles of that religi
on, to which 1 know they are zei
loufly and fuperftitioufly devoted ;
to the influence vrhich these princi
ples have had upon the political go
vernment of every nation in Eu
rope for centuries. If unfortunate
ly for this country, we shall ever
be induced to make so fatal an ex
periment, we may reft allured, tb*t
the niaintainance of a Protertant es
tablishment, and of our connetftWfti
with Great-Britain, must be oncc
more put to the iflue of the fwdfi
and whenever the fubjeift
mended to us from the throne, fhffll
come into debate, I will (tare, with
out reserve, thegrounds upon which
I have formed that opinion. I trust,
however, that no degree of lenity,
or rashness, qr timidity, will ever
induce the parliament of Ireland to
yield her best security for the peace
and prosperity of the country, com
mitted to their care. Whatever e-
I vents may arise, I will in
defending the present conftÂ»tÂ»tion
of this country, and transmitting it
to pofterfcy ; and, info doing, I am
fatisfied that I shall prove the best
friend of the people of lreand,
whether Protestants or Catholits."
