Richmond, Aifguft 17, 1793.
fMPIiESSED with a full cmivi&ion of the
wiklomofyour adminiflration in general, &â 
especially approving that system of conduct
Tffhich you have adopted, ind (teadily oblerv
ed towards the belligerent powers of Europe
we, the inhabitants of Richmond and its vi
cinity in the commonwealth of Virginia, are
happy in an opportunity of conveying to you
their genuine fentiinents.
When propitious heaven had crowned with
victory the efforts of your country and yoiir-
J'eli, while rejoicing America enumerated the
blclliiigs to be derived froij) so important a
revo utiog, it was not reckoned among the
teatt of tbem tha', in future, the people of
this favored land might in peace pi their
own happinifs,though war -And violelfte Ihould
desolate the European world, or drench it in
human bloodâSo too, when the good genius
of Amerii a had deviled that change in otir
government, which her wifdmn has since a
itoptedjit w.is heltl an argument atfotrie weight
ugainft the necefiitv of this (change, and all"in
opposition to it with one voice declared, that,
situated as this country is, no njadnefs or.fol
ly could ever be To lupreme -as to involve us
again in European contests. Nor was this
opinion, so uniform and uuiverfal, in favor
of peace, derived from any other lource than
a knowledge of the real situation and a con
viction of the real intfcrefts of America. It
is impoflible for the eye of cool and tempe
rate reason' to survey ihefe United States
without perceiving, that, however dreadful
the calamities of war may be to other nations,
they ar6 still more dreadful to us, and howe
ver important the benefits of peace to others,
to us they are fti.fl more beneficial.
From tilofe whose province it is to make
war, we expert every effort to avoid it con.
filtent with the honor, interest and good faith
of America ; from you, fir, to whom is as
signed the important talk of, ''taking care
that the laws be faithfully executed," we
have already experienced the mofl: active and
â¢watchful attention to our dearest interests.
Ever iince the period when a just refpe&
for the voic4 ot your country induced you to
abandon the retirement you loved, for that"'
high station to which your iellow-cit izcns una
nimously called you, your conduct has been
uniformly calculated to promote their happi
ness and welfare : And in 110 instance has this
been more remarkable, or yonr vigilant at
tention to the duties of your office more
clearly di covered, than in your proclamation
icfpf&ing the neutrality of the United States.
As genuine Americans, wUh no other in
terest at heart but that of* our country, un
biafTed by foreign influence, which hiftoi y in
form? us sÂ»as been the bane of more than one
republic, onr minds are (/pen to a due fenfc of
the propriety, jitflice, and wifdorijfflp" tnis
measure ; and we cannot refrain from ex
prefljng our pleasure at its adoption.
We recoiled' too well the calamities of war,
not to use our belt endeavors to retrain any
kicked citizen, if fuc'l* indeed can be fodnd
among u*, who, disregarding his oWn duty,
arid the happiness of the United States, in vi
olation of the law of the land, and the wish
tft the people, /hall dare to gratify his paltry
paflions at the rifle of his country's wel
fare, perhaps of her existence.
W* pj ay heaven to manifeft' its
tial care of these Hates, by prolonging to
tnem the blellmg of your administrationâants
)nay the'pure spirit of it continue to animate
rhe government of America through a fU'C
ceflion of ag|es.
Signed by-desire and on behalf of the nresting,

GEORGE WASHINGTON.
At a general meeting of tbe inhabitants of
the town of Petcrfburg (Virginia) ami its
vicinity, at the comt-boufe of the laid
town on Monday the 2d September 1793.
.-THE committee appointed by the town
m'ccfing held 0:1 Saturday last, to draw up'and
propose to the p relent for their con
fideration, certain refdiutions, this day pro
pofcd to the meeting the resolutions follow
ing, viz.â
Re f *olvÂ«d, T ha* it iÂ«Â»cÂ©nfi{ient with the true
irttereft of t!ie United Spates, as well as their
good faith, to preser ve the ftrifteft neutrality
in the prAfent' situation of Eurdpe.
7 hat; we highly approve, and are firmly re
foived ftridtly to oblerve the President's late
proclamation, because we believe it was dic
tated by a profound knowledge of the lute
rests of th6fe states, and by a sincere and ho
neil desire of promoting their real happiness
and prosperity.
That we will use every exertion to dif
; countenance andTupprefs'all fnch tiefigns and
procee&?rfgs as in any manner tend to inter
- rtjpt that harmony and tranquility which we
enjoy under a just and pacific admiuiftratifm
Â°* ' ia ipP' government.
That the intei ference of any foreign power
or minister in the internal adiriiniitration of
dur govermnent, is an infringement of the
sovereignty of the people, tends to destroy
public cwjfidence, to introduce confufiui* and
anarchy, and therefore ftiould excite the in
dignation and reprehension of every indepen
dent American.
I any attempts to diminifti that confi
dence which our citizens repose in the difin-
of the present chief magilbate
of the United Spates, are equally ungrateful,
illiberal and urjuft.
Resolved, That the Chairman tranfrtiit the
foregoing refdltltidns to Thomas Jefferfbn,
Efq & req;uefl. him to comiriunicate the fame
to the Prefideirt of'the United State*.
And the said resolutions being levei ally and
dirtin<sVly read, were nnaniinoufly adopted.
And the meeting confirming, the following
resolution was prdpofed and unanimotifl'y a
greed to.
_ Refolveri, That we consider the combina
tion of the despots of Europe ngainft the Ii-
Uertiesol Fiance, as having a direct tendency
to destroy the political happiness of mankind ;
& though we fefej aniritereft in preserving our
neutrality, yet it is our fineere w'iihj that ii
]>?rty and the rights of man may be the pre
vailing piilicipies throughout tie universe.
THOMAS G. PEACHY, Chairman.
THE Grand Jury for the
of the counties of llenrjco, Goochland, Ha
nover, Chefferfield, and Powhatan, impressed
with the charge delivered to them by the
pvefidlng Judge of this d*iftii&, have directed
.their attention to the fubjetfis M'hich it pre
sented to their notice, upon some of winch
tfiev think it proper and to express
their sentiments.
Adverting alio to the nature and objess of
their inftitutitfn, thty consider thenifeli'es to
be fully authorised, as oiVen as the occasion
shall be fufiiciently prefling or important, to
animadvert upon the laws and proceedings of
the government.
In the prefeht calamitous (late of foreign
hoftilitres, the Grand Jury conceive that the
I.onor and happiness of, this country ale in a
great measure involved in the conduct which
its government ihall purl'ue towards the na
tions'a't war.
They consider the United States as bound
by the treaties as %vell a$ their dea eft inter
ests to observe a Itri<st neutrality towards the
belligerent powers, and therefore they teftify
in this public manner their high approbation of
thole measures which have been adopted by
the President of tlie United States, to procure
a pun&ual observance of that neutrality and
thereby* to p eferve the'honor and toe promote
the true inteieifcs of this country.
The Grand Jury, estimating as they ought
the foverelgnty and independence of these
United States, view with a juit indignation
all attempts of foreign powers or their Minis
ters to influence the measures of our govern
ment, or to detach the confidence oi* the peo
ple frotii those to whom they Uave committed
its administration, such attempts ought to be
confide Ted as high'infults upon the people of
America, as incitements totbe boldest treason,
and as calculatcd to plunge the government
and Citizens of the United States, into all the
evh of anarefcv and diiorder.

HELVIDIUSâ No. V.
TTAVINGfeen that the executive has no
A A conftitntionn] right to interterc in any
question whether there be or be not a cause of
war, and the cxtenlive confequinces flowing
Irojn the do&rines 011 which a claim has been
a flirted, it remains to be enquired wihether
the is better warranted in the fact
Which he a flumes, namely that the proclama
tion ot the Executive has undertaken to de
cide the queltion, whether there be a cause of
war or not, hi the article of guaranty be
tween the United States and France, and, in
so doing has exercised the right which is claim
ed for that department.
Before I proceed to the examination of this
point, it may not be amiss to advert to the
novelty of the phrai'eology, as well as of the
doiflrines, expounded by this writer. 'The
iource troni which the former is evidently
borrowed, may enlighten our conjectures
with regard to the foqice of the latter. It is
a just obl'er viitien also that words have often
a gradual influence on ideas, and wh'iij used
in an improper jenle, may cover fallacies
which w. ;,tberwfe efc2|w (!l"i
I allude particularly to his application of
the term gmtrvmcn't to the txceulive authority
alone. TPhe I'roclamaiion is " a manifefta-
tion pi the ferife-of the government; 4< whv did
not the government wait, &c.âThe policy
on the f>aj t-of the government oi' removing all
doubt as to its occu dijpojition/'* "It \vm of
great inrptotarfce that our citizens fliould un
derihmdas early as possible the opinion en er
tained by thegovmnnint, &c." If jâ addition
to the reft, the early manifeftation of the vieui
of the government, had any effect in fixing iht
public opinion, &c. The reader will probably be
struck with the reflexion, that if the Procla
mation really portl-iTed the character, and was
to have theeifeas, here ascribed to it, fonie
thing more than the authority of the govern
ment, in the writer's sense of government,
would have been a necefiaiy sanction to the
ast, and if the term 44 governineut be remo
ved, and that ofÂ« Pieiident" fubftitoted, in
the sentences cjuoted, the j lift ice of the re
[ flsftion will be felt with peculiar force. But
| I remark ortl}-, on the Angularity of the llile
! adopted by the writer, as fiiewing either that
. the phrafeÂ«tÂ«gy of a foreign government
is more fatrtilrar t'o him than the phrase
"logy pro|*r to our own, or that he wiflies
to propagate a familiarity of the former
in preference to the latter, I do not know
what degree of difapprobatton others may
think jjue to this innovation of language,
but I consider it as far above a trivial criti
cifrri, to obfervc'that it is by no means un
worthy of attention, whether viewed with
' an eye to its probable cause or its apparent
tendency, " the government/' unquestiona
bly means in the United States the whole go
vernment, not the executive part, either ex
clufjvelv, or ptc-cmincntiy j as it may do in a
monarchy, where thefplendor of prerogative
eclipse;, and the machinery of influence, di
refis, every other part of the government
111 the'former and proper sense, the term has
hitherto been used in official proceeding-;, in
public difcuflions, and in private difconrfe.
It is'as fliort and as eÂ»jy, and less liable to
misapprehension, to fay, the Executive or the
President, as to fay the government. In a
word the new diali& doiild not proceed either
from neceflity, codveniency, propriety, or
perfpicuitv J *110 being in oppolition to com.
mon tifage, so marked a fondnefs for it, jnf
tifies the notice iiere taken of it. It (hall no
important subjecT: of the crefeut paper.
I proceed therefore to observe that as a
" Proclamation," irt its ordinary nle, is an
address to citizens or fubjefts only; as it i
always nnderflood to relate to the law acluullj
in Obeifiwi, and to be an act partly and exclu
/ivcly Executive ; there can be 110 implication
irt the name or the Jo>m of such an inilrument
that if was meant principally, lor the infor
mation of foreign nations ; far le(s that it re
lated to an eventual Jhpulation on a fubjedt, ac
to be witnin the I.egifiaiive province
When the writer therefore undertook tf
e-'gi at't h s new prerogative on the Procla
niation, by afdibing to it so unusual, and 1 11
implied a meaning, it was evidently incum
bent 011 him to ftiew, that the/M7 <if the in
livument cou'd not be fatisfied by any othe
conftruftion than his own. he done this
No. What lias he done ? lie has called th<
Proclamation a Proclamation of neutrality
he has put his own ai bitrary meaning on tha
phi afejand has then,proceeded in his arguments
ami his inl>renf||s, Wlth 3,1 much confidence,
as if no qneftion was ever to be asked, whe
ther the tirin " neutrality" be in the Procla
mttion ; or whether, if there, it could jufti
ly the ufir he mates of it.
It has appeared from nbfervations already
made, that if the tirtn "neutrality" was in'
the Proclamation, it cou'dnbt avail the wri
ter, in the prfifent difcuflion ; but the fact ll

derive no succour, even frbns this rel'ource.

would be very different from a want of con.

It does not appear that ftch a Proclama

The writer ought to have been particular
ly sensible of the improbability that a precipi
tate and cxparte decision of the question arif
-ing under the guaranty, could have beenjn
tended by the proclamation. He had but just
gone through his undertaking, to prove that
the article of guaranty like the reft of the
treaty is defenfive, not offenfive. He had ex
amined his books and retailed his quotations,
to shew that the criterion between the two
kinds of war is the ciromittance of priority
in the attack. . He could'not therefore but
know, that according to his own principles,
the question whether the United States, were
under an.obligation or not to take part in the
war, was a quejlion offaÂ£t whether the firft at*
tack was made by France or her enemies.
And to decide a question ol fact, as well as,
of principle, without waiting sot such repre
sentations and proofs, as the absent and in
terested party might have to produce would
have been a proceeding contrary to the or
dinary maxims of justice, and requiring cir
cumstances of a very peculiar nature, to war
rant' it, towards any nation. Towards a na
tion which could verify her claim to more
than bare justice by our own reiterated and
formal and which must in
her present fmgular and interesting situation
have a peculiar sensibility to marks of our
friend (hip or alienation, the impropriety of
such a proceeding would be infinitely increas
ed, and in the fame proportion the improba
bility of its having taken place.
There are yeafohs of another fort which
K'Quld have been a bar to such a proceeding.
It would have been as impolitic as it would
have been unfair and unkind-
If France meant not to insist on the gar
ran tyj the metifure, without g ving any pre
sent advantage, would have deprived the
'United States of afuttire claim which may be
of importance to their fafety. It would have
inspired France with jealousies of a secret bi
as in this country toward some of her ene
mies, which might have left in her breast a
spirit of contempt and revenge of which the
effects rtiight be felt in various ways. It
must in particular have tended to inspire her
with a disinclination to feed our commerce
with those important advantages which it al
ready enjoys, and those more important ones,
which it anxiously contemplates. The nation
that consumes more of the fruits of our foil
than any other nation in the world, and flip-"
plies the only foreign raw material of exten
five use in the United States would not be
unnecefTarily p< ovoked by those who under
stand the , public interest, and make it their
study, as it is their interest to advance it.
I am aware that the common-place remaik
will be interposed, that, " commercial privi
leges are not worth having, when not fecurcd
by mutual interest; and never worth purchasing,
bccaufe they will grow of themselves oat ol a
mutual interest." Prudent men, who do not
fuffer their reason to be misled by their preju
dices will view the fubjeft in a juftcr light.
They will rtfleÂ£V, that if commercial privileges
are not worth purehafing, they are worth hav
ing without purchase ; that in the commerce of
a great na'ion, there are valuable privileges
which may be granted or not granted, or grant
ed either to this or that country, without any
fenfibJc influence on the interest of the nation
itfelf ; that the friendly or unfriendly disposi
tion of a country, is always an article of mo
mtnt in the calculations of a comprehensive in
terest I that fomr Sacrifices of interest will be
made to other motives; by nations *s well as
bv individuals, though not with the fame fre
quency, or in the fame pioportions that more
of a diiinterefted conduit or of a coiiaufi found
ed on liberal views of interest, prevails in some
nations than in others, that as far as can be seen
of the influence of the revolution on the genius
' and the policy of France; particularly with "re
gard to the Unttcd States, everv thing is 10 be

country can reafrrtiabjy hope from another. In
this point of view a greater error could ndt have
been committed than in a step, that might have
turned the present disposition of France to open
her commerce to us as far as a liberal
tion of her interest would permit, and her
fjiendfhip towards us, and confidence in our
fritndfhip towards her, could prompt, into a
disposition to, shut it as closely us as the
united motives of interest, of distrust, and of
ill-will, coul,d urge her.

lity with treaties in the latter cafe coijld not be
inferred from the proclamation in the former,
because the circumfiances night be different. Tale
ing the proclamation in its propei fei>4V, as ie
minding all concerned, that as the United States
were at prace (thpt state not affiftcd by
foreign wars, and only to be changed by the
legislative authority of the country) the laws of
peace were still obligatory and would be en
forced, and the inference is so obvious and f<i
aoplTcable to .all other cases whatever circum

LONDON, July 16.
Declaration of the French,
Aflembled under tbe command of Gene
ral Gallon, in tbe Departments of
Vendee, Maine, Loire, and Loire
Infericure.
Denounced by the assembly entitling
itfelf the national convention of France,
a3 traitors to our country, and rebels to
its laws, we ought, as our duty, to de
clare to all loyal Frenchmen, and all the
loyalists of Euiope, the motives which
have hitherto diiefted our conduct, the
principles which (hall for the future regu
late it.
When firft we aflembled in February
last, in the defence of our lives, of our
individual fafety, of our religion, of our
libetty, and of our property, thegreatefl:
of crimes was committedâthe head bf
Louis XVI. was brought to the fcaf
fold.
From that time, nothing eould be ex
pected from the new order of things that
arose up in France, under the name of
republic, but confufion, robberies, and
anarchy, every day gave birth to a new
faflion ; and if these robbers sometimes
appeared divided among th.emfelves in
opinion and interest, upon two principal
points they terminated their difference,
viz. usurpation and pillaging of property,
maffacreing andimprifoning goodcitizens,
who refufed being accomplices in their
enormities.
For more than three years the rights
of persons and property have undÂ«ngone
in France numerous attempts ; violence
hindered us from the free exercise of the
religion of out fore fathers. But, there
remained to us a King j and though he
was stripped of that part of his authority
so necessary for the maintaining a great
monarchy, we were still in hopes that the
French people would yet acknowledge
their true intercfts, and that order would
be re-eftablilhed without cor.vulfions, and
without violence.
We were deprived of this-lad hope
when we saw our fellow citizens, truly
groaning under the yoke of a small num
ber of factions, but making no effort to
liberate themselves ; struck with conster
nation at viewing our king dragged to
the place of execution ; but keeping si.
lence through terror, and not daring to
arm ourselves to rescue him from the
clutches of his executioners.
Under such dilemmas, what were loyal
fubje&s to do ?âeither accomplices or
victims was to be our portion ; but we
would be neither the one or the other ;
we have assembled, we have aimed our
selves, and hitherto Heaven has crowned
our efforts with success.
We are not the aggressors ; our inten
tions are only to defend our persons and
property. As men, we have the righr
to refill oppression ; as possessors of pro
perty, we oppose its devalhtion â¢, as
Frenchmen, we will hare a king ; as
Christians, we will have the religion of
ourTathers; as citizens, we will have
fixed laws, under cover of which we may
again find peace. In fine, we are weary
of being the sport and vifiims of the
fa&ious.
This is neither the time nor place to
declaim on political opinions 5 we have
not the smallest pretension to govern
France. Individual fafetv, property,
liberty of religious worship, and a king,
are what we demand j for that it is we
contend ; and we will not disarm till we
have obtained them. .
We invite all people', whatever may be
their political or religious opinious opini
ons, to unite themfelvea quickly to us ;
it is their moll prefiihg interest ; for every
man who is not a robber is oh our fide ;
if any citiz;n has not a hed |^op er Â»y t
defend, all have at le:tft theiY p<:r rnn.
property, (and peifonal liberty it <ham<
fuliy violated by our enemies) all are in
tetefted in enjoying in peace, the fruit o
their labor and industry ; all are intereit
ed in living securely at home, and to hav.
their house? for an asylumâthis is wha
we demand for our fellow citizens, a:
well as for ouifelves.
It is the intcreft of all the powers ol
Europe to sustain arid protest us ; sot
our,enemies arc such at withed to over,
throw, every king and 1 every throne. â¢
It is the interest of all people to fend
us help : for our enemie# wished to dif<
turb the peace, and overturn the laws ol
all people.
Our enemies unmercifully punish with
death those of us they make prisoners ol
war. We declare, before all Europe and
France, that we have not used, and wt
will not use, in this respeCt, death foi
death. The cause which we defend ii
that of justice and humanity ; and w<
will never dishonor it by a&tof barbarity.
They threaten to cruih ui by number!
and the factious announce, that thej
will attack us with all the forces they car
aflemble. We await them determined
for we have on our fide our courage, anc
the julf?e of our cause. We have th<
God of armies, who will fight for us'!
the God of Clovis and of St. Louis
who did not permit formerly the Frencl
monarchy to be overthrown, and wh<
miraculouily fullained the throne of 001
kings, almoftdeltroyed under Charles V
under Charles VII. and under Henn
IV.
At lad, if, by one of those ltrokes o
providence, which the human mind car
neither calculate nor forefee, we are oÂ»er
come in the defence of a cause so jull, wt
shall at leait have the glory of dying, ij
fighting for our God, for our king, anc
for our country,âthousands will arn
themselves sooner or later to avenge us
for the Funch pepple will at last be wearj
of their heavy yoke of anarchy ; anc
even our defeat itfelf will serve to hafter
the fall of our tyrants. JJefides, le
them not believe us so weak as we ar<
said to be at the bar, and at the tribuni
of their aflembly, where they place u
between vidtory and punidiment ; so
they are always strong, who have.qo o
ther alternative but to conquer or die.

s 1 R, _
TN compliance with the requeil
of the learned body over whom you
preftde, 1 now chearfully tranl'mit
them a few brief and detached ob
fervarions on the nature and treat
ment of the present malignant and
disorder which prevails in this
rata'
city. Their humane anxiety to af
ceitain the real character of the
complaint, and to eftabliih feme
fixed and steady mode of cure for
it, are frefh proofs of their benevo
lence, and clearly evinces that dif
inteietfed liberality for whi,ch they
are so eminently diftingtiifhed. I
only regret that their application
to me. has approached so near the
â moment of my departure that I have
fiot futficient leisure to elucidate
the fubjet r t so amply and fatislaifto
rilj as the importance of it de
serves. imperfe<fl however as the
enclofeit Iketch may be, 1 can with
truth allure them, that it is the re
sult of extenftVe experience and ac
curate oblervation, and that it is
dilated solely by a philanthropic
defile of checking the ravages of
the difeafe,and ol restoring tranqui
lity to the dejecfted' minds of the
public.
This disorder arises from conta
gion. Its approaches are flow and
insidious at the commencement. It
is Ulbered in with a flight degree of
languor and lassitude, iofs of appe
tite, reftleflnefs and ditlurbed
dreams* depreflion of spirits, and
a want of inclination to perform
oicHnary occupations of life.
The pnrient does not eonfider him
felf fufficiently lick to complain or
call in the aififtance of a pliyGcian.
His feelings are rather unpleasant
than alarming. This train of I'ymp
toms continue for two. or three
days, and if not removed by timely
aid, is succeeded by a sharp pain in
the head, anxiety and foppreffion
about ths praECordia, a febrile pitlfe,
great prostration of strength, and a
variety of other morbid phenome
na which are too well known to the
faculty to need description. In the
flrft stage ps the disorder a little at
tention and the well directed ef
forts of a Ikilful practitioner may
generally prove fuccefsful in miti
gating the violence of future symp
toms and preventing either much
danger or long confinement. At
the firft appearance of languor, las
situde, &c. especially if the patient
has been nearr the source of conta
gion, he should carefully avoid all
fatigue of body and application of
mind. Every thing tliat can tend
to debilitate fhauld be carefully
guarded against. He should remain
at perfetft reft. His diet should be
fuller and more cordial than nfual,
and a few extraordinary glalles of
old Madeira may be allowed. He
should take the cold bath every
morning, ana if his sleep is disturb
ed, a gentle opiate combined with
a few graiiis of the volatile salts
and some grateful aromatic may be
administered at night. A few doses
of good genuine bark may be taken
in powder during ti""?~day; and if
the stomach should be affected with
nanfca, a strong decotftion of the
fame may be fubftitnted. Great
care should be taken to keep the
mind of the patient calm and se
rene ; neither to terrify it with
needless apprehension, nor alarm
it by the melancholy relation ofthe
spreading mortality which sur
rounds him. It is at this stage of
the complaint that the physician
may lay the foundation of future
success : but unfortunately it is alf'o
the period of the disease which is
commonly too much negle<sted by
the patient. Gentlemen of the fa
culty are rarely called in until the
symptoms a.re more alarming and
rlangeroos. But it is a matter of
material confeqnence to the patient
to know that by a little attention
at the commencement, and by care
fully watching the approaches of
the disease, even though it should
be contra<ffed, it may be rendered
mild, and may terminate favour
ably. It is also of equal confe
quenjce for practitioners to attend
to these particulars in laying down
the prophylaxis to their patients.
When the disorder has gained
ground and become violent, and
when the danger is imminent, the
moll .unremitted exertions fbould
be made by the physician to miti
gate the symptoms The nausea
and vomiting maj be relieved by
an infnfion of camomile flowers gi
ven frequently until the llomach is
fufficiently emptied of all crude
rnaiter. SmalL doses of a cordial
mixture com poled of the oil of pep
permint and compound spirits of la
vender may then be taken until the
sickness aba.es. If notwithstanding
the irritability of the stomach
ftionld itill continue, recourse must
be instantly had to the cold bath
which must Be used every two hours
or oftener if the urgency of the
symptoms should require it. After
each immersion a giaft of old Ma
deira, or a little brandy burnt with
cinnamon, may be adminiflered.
Flannel cloths wrung out of spirits
or wine impregnated with spices.
may be applied to the pit of the
stomach and changed frequently.
An injedtion containing an ounce
of powdered bark mixed with thin
falep or sago, to which a teafpoon
fui of laudanum has been added,
should be administered. These in
jections may be continued every
two or three hours omitting the
laudanum after the firft. As soon
as the stomach can bear the medi
cines and nourishment, the bark
may be administered in small doses ;
as much Madeira wine may be gi
ven as the patient can bear with
out afTe&ing his head or heating
hint too much. All emetics and ca
thartics should be avoided. If the
543
bowels fh i oold not be fufficiently o
peit, a fixative clyster may be ne
cellary, or 3 I,'w grains of powder
ed rhubarb added to each dose of
bark until the desired eftedt is pro
duced. If diarrhcea should prevail
it mult be checked by Itarch injec
tions blended with laudanum by
the tin&ura e kino yaponica,< or a
decotftion of carcarilla, All drastic
cathartics do injury when the dis
ease is in its advanced stage. If stu
por, coma, or'delirium should come
on, a large bltfler should be applied
between tite shoulders, and small
â¢ones to the thighs ; stimulant cata
plafins should also be applied to the
soles of the feet. When haemor
rhages appear, the elixir of vitriol
may be administered in'conjunjStion
with the bark, but great care should
be taken to prevent it from affedt
ingthe bowels. If the pulse should
be much funk, the proftiation of
strength great, and fubfulius tendi
num take place, small doses of the
liquor mineralis Hoffinatii, or even
vitriolic sether diluted with water
may be given. Musk and camphor
in this stage of the disease have
likewise proved effectual. Upon
the whole, Sir, I may fuin up this
hasty outline by inculcating the use
of the tonic plan in its future ex
tent, and by warning against the
ill consequences of debilitating ap
plications, or profufe evacuations
in every period of the disease : the
cold bath, bark and wine, a spa
cious well ventilated room, fre
quent change of bed and body li
nen, and attention to reft and qui
et, if properly persevered in, will,
in mod cases, prove fuccefsful, and
flrip this formidable disease of its
malignity, its terror, and its dan
ger- '
The description I have given of
this difdrder, and the utility of.the
plan of cure 1 have laid down, are
confirmed by experience, and coin
cides with reafctn and the
soundest theory ; the cause produc
ing the effedt is a strong debjliiat
ing power; the fympjonis occasion
ed by its appjication, all indicate
extreme debility in the animal
fuiMfttpns, and great derangement
of the-nervous fyfiem ; ought not
therefore the remedies adapted to
'this ci'rtrpiaint, to be Cordial, stimu
lating and tonic ? Should not vio
lent evacuations which evidently
weaken and lelax, be avoided ?
These are hints which would be
presumptuous, and afl'uniing in me
to extend or dwell upon ; to gen
tlemen of fueh eminence as your
colleagues it is luflicient to point
out what reason and experience con
jointly suggest to me ; Their supe
rior judgment will, 1 am convinced
supply every deficiency and enable
them to pursue that plan which is
best adapted to public utility, and
the effedtOal removal of the present
dreadful malady. If the few ob
lervations 1 have suggested be ser
viceable to the inhabitants of
this city, my intentions will be ful
ly answered, and my feelings com
-1 gratified.
