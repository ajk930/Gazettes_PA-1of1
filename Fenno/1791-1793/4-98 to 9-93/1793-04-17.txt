FROM THE. ORACLE OF DAUPHIN.
PRINTED AT HARRISB UfcG H,
LOUIS, then, has at length ascended the fcaf
lold !â is at lengthâ beh jaded !â Cruel
l-tejâHumanity supposes the crown might have
fuffifedâfuppofes that, ftript of the trappings of
rovsltyâdeprived of regal power â-Louis might,
n*y, ought to, have been permitted to liveâa
cin.-cnof Fiance. However perfefl the rrpub
licm system of France may be; however con
ducive to the eftablifhmmt of univrrfal libeny ;
it will be viewed with horror by poftertty when
found fealcd with the blood of Louis XVI.â
It.humanity and insult tio not, cannot,conftitute
republicanism : but behold Louis! haplcls fel
low-creature iâThe viteft criminals arc, in all
countries, permitted to address the surrounding
multitude, on the fuhjefl of their guilt or inno
cence, without interruption : but this, it seems,
wps too great indulgence for him. Unfortunate
l.i/uis!â The withholding that indulgence, how
ever, with the contemptible manner in which it
was withheld, was more degrading to his exe
cill toners, (not to fay MUR DKR F.RS) then nior
trir*. - Inluhing IKm -tn raameot
of deaili, while yej his foul hovered over the
verge t>f eternity, the fonnd of drums and
trumpets, was an inflance of contcmpt never Ex
hibited before ; derogaioiy to the charaflers of
Freach republicans; and which has fixed an
indelible blot oil the hiltoric page of France !
May luch conduct never be imitated !
All this contcmpt and ignotniny wasiinpofed
by the French on Loo isâwho was oncc a mo
narch beloved âthe pride of Frenchmenâlor
aspiring to the dignity which he once poffeflcd.
Is it reasonable to suppose, that Louis was, by
nature, a greater enemy to the freedom of man
kind, than the members of the National Con
vention ? Is it not the most eligible poittion,
that under the influence of a similar education,
and expectations, he would have ranked among
the forernoft patriots in Francc ? But where is
the man who, nursed in the lap of royalty, im
bibed with his firft milk, the principles of here
ditary right; and whose whole plan ol educa
tion had been calculated to inspire him with a
firm conviction of his indubitable right to sway
the sceptre, would have aÂ£ted otherwifc ? Such
ideas instilled, I fay, into his mind from his
earlvrft infancy to maturity, not only by the
most linking precepts, but by the example of
his pre'deceffor, whose authority, so tar from
being controuled, or even disputed, was sanc
tioned by the united approbation and encomi
ums of his fubjefls, must neccffsrily have prompt
him to similar measures. Gratitude should rife
in proportion to the benefit received'; without
adveiting 10 the actuating cause : for, let that be
what it may, the benefit is flill the fame. Then
let us drop a mbutary tear to the memory of a
mail 1 , whofi- peculiar fituan'on in life exposed
him to fufferings, of which no other man was
capable, and whose only crime (if he was guilty
a crime) was merely the etteft of education.
The real service he rendered ut (when a King)
in our struggles for freedom, every circumltancc
ccmfidered, was alone fufficient to counterba.
lance all the political errors of hit lift, and de.
mand&our warmcft gratitude.

Massacre tif the Second oj September.
A Deputation from the- society
of Def enders of the sole andindt
vifible Republic (Jacobins) of Paris
appeared at the Bar, after which
one of them spoke as follows :
" We hoped that the death of the
Tyrant would have put an end to
all animosities ; butyou have order
ed the minister of justice to prose
cute the authors of the occurrences
of the 2d and 3d of September, Or
der him also to prosecute the authors
of the maifacres in the Champ de
Mars, and at Nanci; and thole per
sons who signed the petition of the
Feuillans : all of whom we have alÂ«
teadv pardoned.
" The 3d and 3d of September
are not such as they have been re*
presented.
" Did pot the people know, that
there were innumerable villains con
fined in the prisons by the counter
revi>luiiÂ®nary tribunals ; and that
they intended to fortify thcmfelves
there, and procure the King's escape
by means of a junction with the
Chevaliers of the foignard ?
" The people puniflied the guil
ty, and set the innocent at liberty.
After this they flew to the frontiers
and conquered the enemy.
" Legislators ! these excefles ought
to be urged againlt thole who pro
voked them ; and you ought to re*
colled, that popular vengeance is
but a fupplpment to the laws. We
A FREEMAN,
!OAf THE NATIONAL GAZETTÂ£.therefore demand, that you repeal

Another deputation from the sec

made a great clamcir.]

he bad bathed the hands of many
of the Mai ltjllpis with tears, pud ac
tually preserved fevet al of the pri

that initead of five or lix affaflins,
there-were no less than io,oÂ©o men
armed with inulkets and hnjonets,
and that Manuel and Petion were
privy to the founding of the alarm
bel).
After a short but tumultuous de
bate, ill which ojjc member termed
the other Scehrat, the Convention
decreed, that .all proceedings (hould
be (topped until the report was re
ceived from the minister ofjuftice.
A letter was read from thecommif
faryofthe maiiue at Ville Franche,
announcing that ail the inva

The commissioners at Liege write,
that provisions for the army arrive
from all quarters ; that the persons

the eve of being restored in all the
other cities, in which there are yet
no military hospitals, pay m afters,

STOCKHOLM, January 18.
On the 15th inft. a deputation
waited on the Duke Regent, to as
sure his Royal Highness of the fide
lity of the citizens of the capital.
The deputies were most graciously
received, and had the following as
surances made them :
" That it was the intention of
the Duke Regent to deliver the con
stitution established by the deceased
monarchy as well as all the privi
leges and prerogatives attached to
it, in all their integrity, to the king
his nephew, on his coining of age."
This declaration has occalioned liere
a general contenr. His Royal High
ness has also revoked the form of
the process relative to the regulati
on of ecclefiaflical affairs, adopted
by'the Diet in 1789. Every thing,
in short, is to be placed on the an
cient footing.

that we will exert all our fti ength
to prevent the infringement of them,
as well as to re establish all things
011 the fame footing as that on which
they were under our great grand
father Charles VI. It is agreeable
to our way of thinking, to aÂ«ft with
kindnefsand clemency even towards
the enemies of the Belgic provinces
and others. For this reason we
grant a general amnesty, and with
out exception, promising that every
thing which has hitherto patted shall

It is certain that the Queen has

Extract of a letter from a gentleman in the De/a-
ware State, to hisJr'end in this city.
" I have jll ft been reading the hiltory o!
.lie crimen, enormities, and absurdities ol
human nature, from the end of the 9th cen.
tury, down to the present timeâSuch a pic
ture mull disgust every thoughtful person,
with the (pecies he belongs to, unlets indeed
he reflect that the aggregate of human worth
was ever to be found in the private walks ol
doineitic retirement. But for many centu
ries 1 fear, little of this worth was to be seer
even there The small frock of curreui
knowledge feeins only calculated to oppreP
with more plaulibility the ignorant multitude,
who without the honor or fortitude of il>er<
savages; without any interest iÂ« the <joar
rels of their rulers, were fatrificed, withnu'
remorse, t8 the irrational ant) barbarous poll
cy of tnonfters called Popes, Kings, and Em
perors. At length, however, a dawn of hop*
feeined breaking in upon the world, that thÂ«
condition of poor human nature was altering
for the better. The progress made in science
id the knowledge of civil liberty and genuini
religion, was cheering every liberal and goo<
heart, with the idea, that the ferocity of met
was foftening into humanity, and the perio<
nearly at hand, when the deftru&ion of thi
human fpecie< would be confined entirely ti
the savages of the forefr But alas ! How i
weep again, over the woeful tragedies no*
acting, on a theatre, which is continuallj
boafrmg its preeraiuence in politics and ir
philolophy ! Refinements in cruelty, barbari
ty and profligacy, instead of yielding to the
light of reason, appear to keep pace with its
progress, and the fame enthusiasm which for
ages lias desolated the earth, is as active as
ever in the work of death and ruin, though
367
cloathed in the plausible garments of Freedom <
and finality. In reading the dii'courfes of the i
present rulers of France, one won id be ted to
imagine that the human faculties had been
suddenly promoted to a degree of energy un
known to ancient times'; that man lu'id oflu
med a superior rank in the o.der of intellec
tual beings, wJ.ilft at the fame time we be
hold all the low and boisterous passions. mark
ing every ft age of their conduit, and the apos
tles of liberty and humanity, funk as deep in
blood as the inquilitor or the despot. The
fact, I believe, is, they have determined to
make the experiment upon Bayle's fentinient,
that a nation of Atheifls may be a moral and free
people 9 and all but themselves muft-clearly Ice
that they have failed in the very outset-â
Even a tlem of I fufpedt, will never
anfweritieir piirpofe, and it is really aftoii
iftiing' that 'men of abilities in legislation,
should rank the doctrines of tlie Gospel, among
antient prejudices and abuses. Nothing
would be moreeafy than to demonstrate that
of all tbe fvftems ever held out to mankind,
the tenets of the Gospel are the nioft demo
cratic. It contains exprellions and injunc
tions of equality not to be met with elsewhere.
In vain will either despotism or aristocracy I
look for fan&iorf or shelter under the law of
Christ ; and I will venture to fay, that the
CHrifkian comftitution has provided more ef
fectually for the Rights of Men 9 than any that
can bef frafnetl by the National Convention
of France.
In the tfereli&ion of this divine fyftern, I
think we may discover the source of all their
enormities. In combating ancient prejudi
ce", they have fallen into modern ones equal
i ly groundless and fatal. They have attribu
ted to religion the tyranny of despots, and the
tame fubmilfton of nationsâThey have con
founded Papal ambitfon and Prieft-craft, with
the do&rinex ps Christianity ; and forgetting
the tipe old maxim that corrupt!o optind fit
ttg&fnve greedily fw allowed ail tll<t
extravagancies of their dogmatizing Uphifts,
who hive wanted either discernment or can
dor, todvflringuirti between the genuine tenets
of religion, and the follies which knavery or
ignorance have grafted upon it, and fan&ified
under-that name.âThey have not consider.
Ed, that to discard both together, or to attack
the firft on account of the last, is at least as
far from true wisdom as fupe.ftition itfelf.
lfchriftianity is to be difmifled because evil
men have made it instrumental to abuses, let
us for the fame reason banish reason, philo
sophy and freedom from society. The pic
ture now exhibited by that powerful nation,
is certainly dark and disgusting to ever)* un
prejudiced eye ; and for my part, I can feel
but little grounds fit the exultation that has
been nianifefted at the success of their amis.
It woukl have been time enough for America
to rejoice over the defeat of Francis and Fre-
when the conduit of their conquerors
should be marked with the mild feature of
Philanthropy and Benevolence. At present
the most sanguinary ostracism is their only
law, and as the last and best of their kings
!Â«*â Â» victim tn wc rrrrsv trr.ftly
couclude what will be the fate of thousands of
more ignoble fufFerers. A revolution ce
mented by such torrents of bloodâmuch of
which has been unnecefTarily Hied, must af
ford b&t {lender hope for the future happiness
of a nation ; for however certain it is, that
the left of man has ever been to smart under ail
the branches of tyranny and oppreflion ; yet
will not this consideration excuse the afiert
ors of liberty, when they wantonly pursue
the fame desolating plan. In my opinion the
only credit due to these reformers, is, to have
demolilhed the foundation of ancient def
potifra, and to have eradicated-abuses, which
have for ages been the reproach and scourge
of human nature ; but political happiness con
sists not in deftrullion alone : New systems
must be e relied on the fcite of the old ones.
A chasm in coercive laws, would be as dan
gerous as tyranny in a Prince or Minister,
and every artful villain would become a des
pot ; wherefore, unle's a government be a
dopted immediately that may tranquilize that
agitated nationâthat may increase their
cbmforts wttilft it secures rheir rights, that
prptell individuals from mobs ar.d de
magogues, more effectually, than former laws
defended them from nobility and courts; un
less it check the spirit of conquest and pro
mote the peace of mankind, by countenanc
ing urefill knowledge and genuine religion, the
only fruit of this revolution will be, to have
vouzed an impetuous people from the lethar
gy of slavery, to the fever of liberty, without
furnifhing remedies for reducing them to that
temperate composure, for want of which, po
litical equality can never subsist.'' Fed. Gaz.

knowledged throughout Pari??, and we our
felve* heard it triumphantly recorded by a
young French aristocrat, who occasionally
aflifted ot the ceremony.
For a considerable time before the tenth of
August, the royalists alTumed a very imperi
ous ton^itheir numbers were formidable, and
they announced, without reserve, their hopes,
which with them amounted to a certainty of
a couotter-revolution, and their paflimcs
were adapted to the sanguine expfeftations
they indulged.
" There has been a machine lately invent
ed in France, for the execution of < riminals,
called a Guiilotin, after the name of its in
ventor, and It is contrived, that on dropping,
instantaneously to fever the head from the
body. In the ariftoeratic families, and chief
ly among those connected with the Queen, it
was the cufl-om every day, as soon as dinner
was fjnifhed, to have one of these Guillotine
in miniature, brought in with the desert.
Around it were fixed figures representing
some of the piincipal and moll obnoxious pa
triots, Messrs. d'Orleans, Condorcet; Briffot,
&c. Abont the neck of each, was a ImaU
phial containing a ctimfon coloured liquid
perfume. A magistrate (one of the party)
was appointed to try the criminals, and im
mediately on sentence being pronounced, by
an ingenious mechanical pi'ocefs, down drop
ped the Guiilotin, the head was 2t once chop
ped off, and the blood flowed, when the com
pany in general, and particularly the ladies,
eagerly and joyfully fteepeck their handker
chiefs in it, and applying Vt to their noses, in
extacy exclaimed, 4< qu'il eft doux, le
fang des patriotes Ah ! how sweet is this
patriot blood!" for amongst them, as with
our fine gentry in London, the word patriot
is an epithet of mockery and dcrifion.
" From the above well known fact, we
leave our readers to conclude, what the re
sult would have been, if victory had inclined
to their fide. Eleven thoufar.d victims were
already firedeftined to the block, and it can-
not be supposed there would have been much
pains bestowed on th * formation of tribunals
for trial."
