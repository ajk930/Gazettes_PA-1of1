FROM THE GENERAL ADVERTISER.
Mr. Bach e ,
I FIND, from the newspapers, that
there is a great deal of fuii among
the folks in the city, about war in
Europe and the Frefident's procla
mation. I obferve,too,that two Ame
ricans have been committed to gaol,
to take their trial, for entering on
board a French privateer, and aililt-
ing to take f'onie vefleU belonging
to the British, with whom it is
said, we are at peace, and ought
therefore to live In rtriift jriendjhip<
with them. 1 wilh, Mr. Bache,that
you would explain all this to us
flnipletons in the country, who are
at a loss to understand your city
language, particularly when you
talk at duty, intercjt, jriendjhip, ini
partiality, peace, &c. I believe that
your city-folks have I'ome better
dictionaries than Jnhnfon's and She
ridan's, when you set about explain
ing thefehard words. Forinftance
now, you talk of.being at peace or
in jriendjhip with Great-Britain :
But let me aik you,
I. If Great-Britain were to seize
upon ihe cities of Boston, New-

2. Jf this would ivot be peace, but
war, how will yoflr government
men be ai>le to make it out, that to
have our wfefterw ports held from
6s, and gjurifoneil by the Britilh, is
flat war also ; or at lealt very uis
fr'tcn'Siy ,condii<Ttâefpeeially when
it: is added, that these fame BritWh
gat rifoua rob us of the fur trade,
and encturage the Indians to mur
der our jieople on the frontiers '
?. If the two privateer's men |
ihouid be punt/liÂ«d for entering into
the French service, then, 1 suppose,
every man who enters inro foreign
service without leave ofour govern
ment-men, is liable to be piinilhed
alio ; at thin rate, will not Col.'Os
wald, Maj. Â£yilace, and many other
brave Americans, who are now pay
ing a debt ef * -Â«ur old
friends the French, be liable to se
vere punishment, if ever they re
turn |o their native country
Do, Mr. Bache, be so kind as to
procure an ajifwer to thef'e three
queries from some of your corres
pondents, particularly the second ;
for I am very desirous to know bow
we can be at peace with a nation,
that holds forcible patfejjion of a num

IF I underhand your Queries,tliey

war wilh Great-Britain : Permit me
in return to ask you a few quefti-
OIIS.
Can America join France against
Great â¢ Britain, without bringing up
on her the enmity of the other com
bined powers !
Placed by nature at the dillance
of 3000 miles frrtin France, and ijoo
from anj of her pofl'eflions, what
aid can we give to either without a
naval force ?
To the united navies of Great-
Britain, Holland, Spain, Portugal
and Russia, what lias America to op
j>ofe but 12 custom house boats ?
What would be the expense of
building & equipping a naval force
equal to render active assistance to
France, and protection to our own
comirerce ?
If this be impollible, and our com â 
merce be of course ruined, what
proportion will the price of wheat
and the other productions of the
Farmer bear to the present i
If tiie duties now paid at the cus
tom-bouses by commerce ceal'e, how
are we to raise money for the exi
gencies of the proposed war, but by
direct taxes 011 land, See. &c. or by
loan ?
If direct raxes prove inconveni
ent to rail'e the neceflary funis, (hall
we have reccurfe to foreign or do
mestic loans i If to foreign, from
whom (hall we borrow when at war
wirh all the world ? If to domestic,
will the Kariner and his friends
place fufficient confidence in the
justice of the quarrel, the success of
its event, and the faith of govern
ment, to lend their property ?
If the payment of the iirteieU on
the present debt of the United Stares,
contracted during a war into which
we were driven, and which termi
nated in the eftabliihment of free
dom and happiness, be a grievance,
(hall we diminifli the evil by ad
ding ten millions of dollaib a year
(the average expenle of the late
war) to that debt, by wantonly en
gaging in a quarrel with which Wc
When the Farmer talks of the
western polls, he seems to forget
that there are two banks to a river ;
it would be difficult to prove tfoaj
forts oppofire to Detroit and
ra would be lels troublesome to us
than they are ; or that an Indian
canoe, or Britifli armed vHFeI cebld
not as well navigate on the fide of
t he lakes and rivers wlMrh are theft s
by treaty, as on our fide; In the
â M>niihn Â«if. we hai e I nid aÂ«id
l>o'U enough aTreiuly : when we
want more, 1 prefuine the Farmer
will gallantly turn out and help us
get them.
But from the importance which
the Farmer gives to his argument:
of the f" 11 r 1 ride, I am induced to
fufpei r t that he is really a Hatter,
and t hat tlie advantages which might
derive to his branch of business front
a free trade with the Indians, is
wifely considered by him as an am
ple compensation for what all the
other clafleÂ® of fodety muff fufFer,
from the interruption which war
would give to every other branch
of com merce.
A FARMER.
I will I hank him, however, toan
fwer me, whether he really fippof
es, that the Britifli garrisons in Ca
nada would give iels encourage
nveirt To the Indians to murder i;s in
the time of war, ihan they do now ;
âor whether the Fur Trade would
flouridi under fuel) circumftanres ?
Left from the tenor of these que
ries. the Farmer should call me an
Englifhinan, 1 tliink it proper to af
fore him that I am a native (not an
imported) American. And that be
having served my country in one
war, I have learnt to eflimate its ca
lamities more juflly than he appears
to have done.
MR. F e N NÂ«,
IF we recur to the history of part ages, we
shall find, that enthusiasts ( in religion 4s
well as in politics, have nevfcr frriipjed telling
ten thousand lies in defence of their l efpec
tive lyliemsâAnd the events of our own
times will go to prove, that the prejudices
which governed some of our ancestors, ope
rate witii equal force on the minds of their
posterity.
Itisllotmallyyearsnl.ee, that a few il
literate perrons conduced by a woman of ill
tame, made tlieir appearance in the neigh
borhood of Albany and calling thernfelve, the
chosen people of God, introduced a mode of
worlhip which from its novelty attract d the
attention ofevery bodyâAll intercqurfe be
tween the two sexes was interdicted The
married were prohibited from cohabiting to

considered as Supernaturalâjig tunes were
substituted for hymns, to which they dan

thing that could pollibly operate to their own

The fame farce is acting at this present

If a group of persons, fay forty or fifty,

Mr. Ff. nno,
I READ >0 your last Garette the Declaration
of a Committee oI Ihe Republican Society of
Norfolk and P.infmouth, in Virginiaâand ob.
fervtd therein, with gieat plrafure, a conccfTvn
to the following purport, viz.âThat the citi
zens of the United Suies, under favor of the Su
preme Governor of i he Universe, enj"y " prefrnt
ease, tranquili y and happ-inefs." This declara
tion is of g'eat importanceâ it ought to make
the mot giveful impreflions on every mind,
Â»nd be held in everlafliog remembrance.
The medium thro* which these favors have
been conferred on us, is the general government.
A government'which is. 1 trust, so dear to us all,
that every individual citizen will be a (hield to
defend it fromJecret or open enemies.
It appears, however, somewhat odd, Mr.
Printer, to talk of Republican Societies in the
raidft of a Republican Government. The world
at large supposes ih&people of the United States
form one great Society of Republicans. The
Norfolk and Portsmouth Society may however
be Republicans of a superior class â double re
fined!
Some persons have expressed surprize at the
attempts made to form political focie'ies in this
country, under denominations so perfeÂ£lly coin
cident with the nature of the government and
the fpiritof the people. In Great-Britain and
other European countries, such societies may be
established on patriotic principlesâfor there the
governments diverge from the few republican
principles which they contain, towards ftrongeT
degrees of despotismâand every check to the
encroachments of arbitrary power, is fomelhing
gained by the people ; but here, the people are
â¢â¢ easy, tranquil and happy," under the mod
petfeft system of republicanism the world ever
jaw â I wish to fee measures pursued which
have a natural tendency to preferveihis govern
ment in its purity. There is but one effectual
method â Make the people in principle Republi
cans. In order to this, they must be enlighten
edâthe foundation, must be laid in youthâ
.Education is the only preparative. Societies
tor promoting the gr/*at woik of education
among the poor, would be republican indeedâ
for without knowledge and information, rhe
people are 1 he blind followers of fattious leaders,
who combive merely to overthrow every inftitu
lion that opoofes their ambitious projects.

Mr. Fenno,
HWING lately fecn in the public prints, a
declaration of the (landing committee of
ihc Republican Socic:y of Norfolk and Porifi
mouth, at a meeting held on the 3d inft. I have
taken the liberty of fumifhing you with the
copy of another political creed, which in ray
opinion is not destitute of merit.
At a general meeting of the friends to order and
good government, specially convened for the
purposeâ
Resolved, That it is the opinion of this
meeting, that a declaration comprising anexpo
firion of the fentimems and principles which
have uniformly influenced the friends to order
and good government, be pubUflru d to all the
world.
DECLARATION.
Citizens, declare as our
unalterable opinion, that the bleflings of a just,
mild and -equitable government, can only be
perpetuated by a prompt obedience to the laws,
refpeft for morality, and a fti itt adherence to
the divine injunction of " doing unto all men
as we would they should do unto us."
That the attention which many of our fellow
citizens discover towards chimerical systems of
jurisprudence, card playing, hoife racing, &c.
as well as ihe predile&ion which they evinc* in
favor of other men's bufmefs in preference to
their own, is to us a matter ps serious concern
and regrci
That altho' liberty is attainable by all nations,
ret nevertheless we hold it for a truthâThat a
Free government can exist no where but
Â»mong a virtuous and cnlightcni d people : Any
attempt therefore to prorogate liberty at the
point of the bayonet, is as absurd as it is wicked.
That the security reluliing from out- remote
fit nation from Europe can only be endangered
by the machinations of a few icftlefs individuals,
â who, actuated by pride, envy, qr want, are en
deavoring by all the, means in their power, to
-destroy a government so wifely calculated to
insure the happiness of the citizcns thereof.
That it is ihe pshocativi of Firemen to
(peak their fentimenis without reserve on the
JubjeQ of all governments, whether eltSivc or
-hereditary, fitnple or mixed, and to condemn
or applaud the means taken to obtain such go
vernments.
That it is a truth, not lc fs notorious than it is
to be lamented, that 111 the bosom of our coun
try, we have men who exclaim against foreign
and yet practice iomcjiu tyrannyâwho talk of
morality, and ate guilty of enormous viefsâ
and who bellow continually about liberty and
equality, sn<3 yet Grange to tell, are cit\?ens
themielÂ«(s of the mod aristocratic ilate m tne
union.
Tpat although Hocus Pocui, the chief of the
magician* and disciples of ihe new pbilofophy,
has in hi* speeches and writings given us to un
dcft-ind, that a clear skin is the only mark by
which to ascertain the rjgbiÂ« of men to the
blcfTings of fieedom âYet ntverthelefs be it
known, and we hereby declaie, that we never
have, or eve* shall fubferibe to the religious, po
litical or moial creed of the said Hocus Pocus,
a harlequin printer, or their aiders and abei
tors.
That strongly impressed with these sentiments,
we have copceivt d :t to be our intcreji, and know
it to be our duty, nocwithftanding the efforts of
all pseudo patriots lo the contrary, to rill (atis
fied with the cor-ftuutional mode of ?tyeringour
own form of government, if called for by the
people, and leaving to all nations the right of
nrw modelling thtir's or not, as to them may
feem meet, without abusing or reviling thetn for
their determination.

them were killed, and jÂ©o ijiken
prisoners.

The head quarters of the Imperi

AMSTERDAM, April 15.
On the approach of the Pruflian troops un
der the command of" Genera) Rombwg, the
French evacuated the whole Duchy of Deux
Ponts.
General Cuftine is ported with his army be
tween Landau and Wiflenbourgâaccording
to authentic intelligence- it consists only of
24,000 men. Gen. Wurmfer, at the head of
12,000 Auftrians and 4003 troops of Hesse
Dannfladt, who closely pursued them as far
as Gemerlheim, has his advanced ports at
Vergzahern. As General de Hohenloe is ap
proaching through the defiles of Dorkheim,
on the fide towards Newftadt, the French will
find themselves between two fires, and be
prevented both from throwing up entrench,
ments, and from procuring aflirtance.
In consequence of a resolution formed by
their High Mightinesses, on the .fth ittli. his
Serene Highness has been requeued to give
orders to the captains of (hips of war, and of
privateers, not to molest or capture, in open
seas, French filhing vessels, equipped solely
for that purpqfe, and not armed. They haye
power, however, to search them in cafe of
suspicion. These orders are to be in force
as long as the fifheries of the state are not mo.
lefted by French privateers.
BRUSSELS, Aprill 13.
A rapid movement made by our army a
gainst Conde, gave rife to tlve premature re
port of its being taken.âNotwitliftanding the
defection of General Dumourier, the French
still seem determined to oppose the efforts of
the combined armies.

After a debate of some hours, a decree

Levaflieur proposed also the arreftation
of Sallesâthis proposition was adjourn,

Stingel, Miranda, Miazifcfki, and
L'Ecuver, were delivered over to the re
volutionary tribunal.
The fitting was then suspended, and
was not resumed till ten this inorningt
An officer from the garrison of Sarre
louis informed the convention, that all
his brethern in arms, filled with indigna

determined to defend the unity and indi
visibility of the republic with their lives.
(Applauses.)
President.-â" Cuftine has said, the day
when you have a king lhall be that of my
emigration.âWell we fay the day on
which we have a king, (hall be that of
the death of Frenchmen. The Convention
applauds the civifm of the garrison of Sar

the fitting." Applauses.)
A letter was read from General Dam
pierre, dated the iothinftant :âlt Rated,
that this army then encamped before
Beuchain, was considerably weakened by
the disorganization and perfidious manoeu
vres of Dumourier. He added, that the
fafety of the republic depended on its
speedy re-organization, and proposed fil
ling up tha old regiments by trained vo
lunteers, who might be replaced by the
lc,ooo men ordered to be raise, and by
the national guards, who are in a perma

committee of public fafety.
Letcer from the National Commiflioners.
"Valenciennes, April 10.
" We inform the national convention,
that the enemy are making movements a
gainftConde. They began to (hew them
selves yesterday in several columns, and
appeared as if making preparations for
ere&ing batteries. A cannonade was kept
up upon them from the town, during the
whole night. They kindled a great ma
ny fires, and we do not yet know whether
ther their attack is real or feint, but at
present all communication between that
place and Valenciennes is intercepted. We
have just nowreceived letters from citizens
Chancel, chief de brigade, and Langlois,
the temporary commandant, which an
nounce the good disposition of the garri
son and the resolution of the brave soldiers
who compose it* to defend themfelveslike
true republicans.
" The Austrian General sent a flag of
truce by an officer to Geneial Chancel,
to tell him veibally that the Emperor was
disposed to treat favorably all those who
should acknowledge the former French
constitution. The General anfweied ver
bally, that he & his brave garrison would
remain invariably faithful to the repub
lic : that they know how to defend thetrf
felves, and that they would live, and if ne
cefiary, die republicans.
" A good spirit begins to be re-ftab
lilhed among our troops, and when they
are fully undeceived tefpeÂ£ting that trai
tor Dumourierâwhen they {hall be con
vinced that the deceitful and perfidious
bait of that constitution which is held
forth to them is only a stratagem of ty
ranny to seduce them, and again fubjeft
the nation to the yoke of the mod odious
despotism, their error willthenbe changed
into profound indignation, and our defeats
into victories."
The Convention decreed, that honora
ble mention should be made of general
Chancel and the garrison of Conde.
The minutes of the fitting of yesterday
evening being read, Petion moved a re
peal of the decree for bringing Miranda
before the levolutionary tribunal. He ob
served, that this General, a vidbm to Du
mourier, was facrificed only by him fur
having had the courage to denounce him
four days before his treachery wan unveil
ed.
During the discussion of this motion,
the deputies were thrown into great com

younger and some others, cri
the Convention vnflic&to faVc s u eotif*jÂ«

Aubry declared that Mijanda tpW

that the decree fcr bringing him befon
the revolutionary tribunal (houid be fuft
pended unlil the Convention had feea ,
copy of his examination before the com.
mittee of war.
After a long and violent debate, th<
Convention pa(Ted to the order of the day
on the motion of Petion, and referred
that of Aubry and several others on thÂ«

Second letter from the Commissioners at
Valenciennes.
"Valenciennes, April if.
" Since our lalt dispatches the army
of the republic has undertaken no opera,
tion. The enemy aie before Coodeâ all
communication between which and this
place continues to be intercepted. That
between Quefsoy and Conde is also cut
off, but Gen. Dampierre is pursuing
roeafutes for re-eftablilhing the inter
course.
" Two trumpets sent to Gen. Dan
pierre "by the Auftriati Gen. were con
ducted to Gen. Fen and, to whom they
delivered an address to the French, from
the Prince of Saxe Cobourg, and a me
morial of Dumouricr, giving a deceitful
explanation of the motives of his condtift.
" It appears that our enemies ate a
dopting a system quite the reverse of what
they followed lall year ; that they affect
modei'ation the better to fed Oct the pco
pie ; and pteaeh up refpedt for property,
to induce the farmers to keep their corn
at home, that they may the more easily
seize it and deprive us of it."
On a motion by Danton, the conventi
on declared in the name of the French
people, that they would not interfere in
any manner, in the government of ftv
reign powers ; but that they would rs
ther bury themselves in the ruins of their
country than fuffcr any foreign power to
interfere with the constitution which they
wish tÂ® form for themfelvls..
The convention further decreed the
pain of death agaiaft any who flvould pro
pose a negciation with the enemy for the
purpose of modeling the conltimtion a
greeable to their suggestions, or recom
mend offering any terms whatever to such
nations as would not fit ft. accknowltdge,
the sovereignty, unity, and indivisibility
of the republic, founded upon liberty
and equality.
A letter was read, dating that the ar
my of Sables had gained a confaierable
advantage over the rebels ; 30 of whom
were taken with arms in their hands.â
Their lof6 was estimated at more than 500
" men killed.
A long letter without date or place
was received from Marat, complaining
that the supporters of the aristocratic fac
tion, in order to divert the public attenti
on from their connexion with the traitor
D umourier, had caused him to be put
into a fiate of arrest, that they might fa
crifice him to their pafiions.
Delaunay, juti, in the name of the
committee of legislation, gave in a report
on the charges bro't agaiuft Marat, and
read ap address begun yefferday by Gau
det, in which it was /ortnalty said, that
the republic could not be saved but by fpeo
dily expelling all those deputies who did
not vote for the death of the late king.
This address was warmly applauded by
the galleries, and by a part of the mem
bers on the right fide of the hall. One of
the latter having moved, that it (houli
be laid on the table and be signed by the
patriots, an hundred of the members of
that fide, with David at their head, ad
vanced immediately in a body to the ta
ble and signed it, amidst repeated accla
mations from the galleteis.
Cambon then moved, and the conven

printed with the signatures.
Some members proposed that it (hould
be sent to the departments and to the ar

The departments ought to know who
those are who foment a civil war."âHis
ses from the galleries.
Fovaux de Calvadas moved the pÂ«Vl

considered as very dangerous.

A memberâ" You yourfelf must be

ed the galleries. Loud applauses follow

sumed Genfonne, " the schism is so great
thathonefl men mud allow that all the

[Yes ! Yes ! cried with one voice, all

ed by part of the members, contains, be
sides thieats, an appeal to the people,
which I myfelf solicit. It is time they
should know whether the making of laws
belong to them or to a wretched faction.
In that state of division, hatred and mif
trult, into which we have been thrown,
we must appeal to the people. It is im
possible that our diffentions can othcrwife
be ended." After representing the dan
ger, however of convoking the primary
assemblies for a total ie-eledtion, he con
cluded frith stating, that the convention
might be prolonged, and the people al
lowed to replace such members as had
101 l their confidence by new deputies.
The report presented by Delaunay in
the name of the committee of legislation,
proposed that a decree of accusation
fliould be passed against Marat.
The confufion was continued, nor was
the debate ended when the above account
was closed.

RICHMOND, June 10.
On Friday last, the Honorable the Judges
of the Federal Court, held in this city, gave
their opinions on the importantfsubjectc c t of the
payment of the British debts (which has en
grossed the attention of the Court, for several
days past.)
The points before the court were,
ift. Whether the Britilh debts were reco
verable in this State, the acts of the Virginia
Aflembly having prohibited the recovery,
which atts pallid prior to the adoption of the
Couftitution of the United States.
2d. Whether the payments made into the
Joan-office were not complete bars to the
plaintifPs ast ion for so much as was paid ?
3d. As the definitive treaty had been bro
ken by the Government of Great-Britain,
Whether the treaty of peace should be carried
into effect 011 the part of America ?
And, lastly. Whether the debtor was not
annihilated by the diflolution of the govern
ment, on the 4th day of July, 1776 ?
The Court were unaniliioufly of opinion
on the I ft, 3d, and last points, for the plain
tiff, confide ring the adoption of toe conftitu
tioij as a repeal'of all laws in oppositiOn to
the treaty of peace, which by that adoption
hud become the supreme law of the land ; and
upon this ground gave judgment for the
plaintiff on the firft point. On the third they
w-re of opinion, that the court could not
take notice of a breach of treaty, if such did
exist, without a declaration to that effect
from ihe Congress of the United States. On
the last, gave judgment for the plaintiff,'as
the plea of the defendant could not be sup
ported by the lawn and iifagcs of nations. Oo
the second point the oourt were divided, Mr.
Jay, Chief-Juftrce of the United States, for
the plaintiffs, Mr. I rede ft and Mr. Griffin for
the defendantsâ>iipon that plea then, judg
ment was entered for the defendantsâa ma
jority of the court funpofing, that as that
law had been carried into complete effect be
fore treaty of peace, and as by thaMaw,
the defendant was discharged from the debt,
the treaty of peace could not again change
bun.

At the prefentmoment, when attempts are
not wanting to mislead the public judgment
and prejudice the minds of the citizens of the
United States against a government, the ad-
Wmi ft ratio 11 of which hath djfpelled every
cloud that darkened our political heniifpherej
ftied a lustre on our national character, and
brightened the profpeft before usâit may not
be amiss. to advert to a few fa<sts, the bare al

friend* to peace freedom and government, in
their zealous attachment to, and support of,
the federal constitution, and the fyitems which
have been productive of so much happiness to

There is not a State in the Union in which
the immediately arising from' the re-
pt* public credit are not ttrikingly
appUrerjt In Tome public, or private underta
king! by which alio the general interest is pro
moted ; few, if any of these undertakings
would probably have had existence for many
years to cortie but for the cause julfc afligned.
In the diifcrift of Maine extensive plans in ca
nallingare on foot, which promise emolument
to the adventurers and great accommodation
to the public. The population, agriculture
and commerce of this diftridt and of the State
of New-Hanipfhire are rapidly advancing.
The attention of their Legislators is engaged
in making extensive and adequate provision
tor difleminating knowledge among the peo
pleâby founding and eftabliflung public schools
and colleges ; while new channels of political
information are continually opening in the
nunierous'weekly publications which the ad
venturers of the type set up.*
In Massachusetts various public works have
been undertaken and effected J bridges erect
ed, and roads improvedâmanufactures esta
blished and prosecuted with spirit and success;
literary institutions spring up in all parts of
the State.; agriculture and the arts flourifh
un3er hand of public patronage,
and the encouragement of an intelligent pub
licâHer commerce explores the re mote ft
regions of the universe, and her ftiips unlade
at home the produce of all climes.
This statement will apply with proper va
riations to Vermont, Rhode-Island, and Con
necticut.-âThrough these happy and flourish
ing States, plenty tranquility and freedom
reign. The farmer plows, sows, reaps and
enjoysâlaughs and sings without care or
anxiety, finding a ready demand and a good
price for all the surplus produce of his labor.
âIn short, human felicity may here be said
to have found a permanent residence.
Large cities like a vortex attratf: every
description of cliara&ers; among these the
jealous, the envious and seditiousâhence the
glooms of restless ambition some times darken
the columns of one or two vehicles of political
murmurings, which are publiftied in Bolton ;
but as they are there born, there they would
die were it not for the transplanting which
they*receive into similar foils in other large
cities* Except these solitary croakings, & the

In the State of New York a noble spirit of

some of the firft patriots of the country, with
ap energy and perseverance that must over

and the favorable circumstances of situation,
of that refpe&able member of the union are
of late brought into viewâand we may reft
allured that these will be turned to the best

Pennsylvania, second to none in the career
of enterprize and improvement, has planst
of the greatest magnitude in altual prosecu

to mature themâthere is the greatest reason
to expect that this extensive State will e/e
long be in a situation lb favorable to inter
nal commerce by land and water, that her
agriculture and trade will be carried on with
as much facility as in the most improved part
of .Great-Britain.
Nor does the improvementof her roads and

the infant state of Georgia ha* increased great
ly, and is making rapid advancesâ this ltads
lier planters to exteod their agricultural im
provements-*âThe exports of that dare alrea
dy form an important item in the geneialert
ports of the unionâ-and in a few years will
shew that the sanguine anticipations of some
of her sons have been founded on juit calcu
lations.
As an abatement to the pleafare arising from
the contemplation of the foregoing particu
lars, the war with the Indians, presents itfelf
to the ingenuous mind } hut while sympathy
is excited, and sensibility wounded at the re
cital of scenes of Indian barbarityâthe pa
triotic and candid part of the community
confide in the solicitude and exertions of the
government for the restoration of peace and
security to the Frontiersâwhich will be ac
complished, unless their zealous endeavors,
accompanied with a great expence ftiould bÂ«f
unhappily prostratedâwhich God forbid.
If the powers combined against France fcrj
oufly believe the account! pub)idled of the pro.
fcriptions, maflTacres,muiders, plundering*, pil.
laging, levelling*, difor'ganiiutions, wretched*
ness and mercy, which are (aid to have rendered
France the mnft unhappy country on the f><t of
the globeâif they lurther believe that all Lht'fe
things flow from the principle! of the leaders in
the French Revolution, as frum tjieir proper
(ourceâand that their own governments are in
the utmoil hazard of being involved in &mil>r
femes of anarchy and distressâit cannot be con*
fldered as furpi'.zing that those powm should
combine,a> well for their mutual defence <gainst
evils ot such magnitude, is for the dediuftton of
principles To hostile to human happinessâevery
didlate of reason, julUce and humanity, would,
compel them to the measure. Bui the
il, whether quite diffetent motives do not adu>
ate the invaders of France ? Whether the appro
henfion of the fubverfafm of their own dvfwot
ifin and the deftruflion ol ancient abufcs,wh'.ch
would involve a diminution of their power and
r< venues, are not the inducements to theit intet
ference in the formation of a government for
France ?âAn mdependrnt nation aflurrdly has
a right toeftabiilh for tlfelj such fyllemi and
rules as may appear to the majority btft calculat
ed to proniote their " peace, liberty and
fafety."

THE Supreme Exccuitve, we leant, has iffufd
certificates of the eleÂ£h<in of ihe Hon..samuel
Holten, Pelec Wads worth, Dwjght
Foster, and Wilijam Lyman, Efquiies,
as Reprefentativcs to the Congiefs ot the United
States.
A informs, that considerable
debate has arisen in the Hon. Council, on the
propriety of issuing certificates to the two last
mentioned gentlemen ; and that the debate arose
from the idea, that the last piecepts iflucd by
tht- Supreme Executive, were informal, if not
ivhoUy illegal; as the Keloluiion of the Legisla
ture required, that the number of candidates
Cent out to the people, (bould be double that of
the Representatives to be chosen ; and that in
the instance of the Western Diltntt, and county
of Hampshire, (in which those gentlemen are
declared to be ele&ed) which are entitled to
two Representatives, only three candidates were
sent out: The confeqnence of this proceeding
is, that the choice of the people has been fruf
trated ; and that the pcrfon to whom a great
majority of the free ele&ors gave their suss.ages,
is debarred being their Representative, from the
circumstance of having been voted for both for
the Dijlricl and Ctunty, of both of whicb he was
that drcUrr.V â¢ Candidate. A llatement of the

UNIVERSITY OF PtMSiYLVANIA,
IT has hitherto been the pra&'ce of this
Seminary (as it was all along the practice
both pfthv* Oid College and of the old Univer
: fityj to exam ne the feverai rolls once a
weekâand, on every fucb occaiion, to levy
fines (except where corporal punishment was
to be utfli&ed) on loch of the Students, as,
during the preceding week, had been either
late in their attendance, or abJent altogether,
at any particular fcilioj;.
But this practice, however good the design
with which it was it ft.tuted, was found to be
attended with some inconveniences. The
collet ion of so many petty fines was both
troublesome and degrading to the Profeflors.
Neither, after all, could the imposition ot
these fines be expected to produce the desired
eflfeft: for, ifconfiderable, they operated ra
ther as a tax upon the parents, than as a
punishment on the boys ; and, it inronfider
able, were but too apt to be disregarded â
And, as to corporal punishment, the inflic
tion of it so frequently, and ;n so public a
manner, could not but tend to wear out that
ingenuous sense of fti3me and regard to cha
racter, which it is one great end of education
to cherish and promote.
At a meeting therefore, of the Faculty,
held April 18th, 1793, it was unaninioufly
resolved,
" First, that all fines and corporal punish
ments for attending # late, or for being absent
altogether, at any particular session, shall be
abolished.
44 And, secondly, that, on the firft Wed
nefday of every month, there (hall he he-da
meeting of the r everal Profenorsand Tutors,
for the purpose of examining the general roll,
and comparing their several particular rolls ;
\frhen an accurate the attend
ance and behavior of each student, during the
preceding month, shall be; made out, and pre
ferred to his parents or guardian."
The faculty confide, that by thus extend
in&es it were, the authority of parents end
guardian*, there will be less need for the ex*
ertion of other authority : and that the ap
prehension of this monthly notice w\\\ be found
to have at least as much influence on the
minds of their pupils, as the apprehcnfion of
the weekly fines and punishments were found
to have formerly.
Published for the information of the pa
rents and guardians of the students and scho
lars at the University.
By order of the Faculty,
