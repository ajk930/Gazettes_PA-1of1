Suabihty and Juiblc are words not in com
mon use, but they concisely and corre&ly con
vey the idea annexed to them.
i. In determining the sense in which Geor
gia is a sovereign State, it may be iileful to
turn our attention to the political fituation v
we were in, pr'or to the Revolution, and to
the political flights which emerged from the
Revolution.
Ail the country now poflefTed by the United
States was then a part of the dominions ap
pertaining, to the crown of Great-Britain.
Every acre of land in this country was
then held mediately or immediately by grants
from that crown.
AH the people of this country were then,
subjeCts of the king of G'eat-Britain, and
owed allegiance to him ; and all the civil au
thority then existing orexercifed here, flowed
from the head of the Briti/h empire. They
were in a strict fenfc jttlow fnfcjeCts, and in a
variety of respeCts one people. When there-
Volution commenced,the patriots did not assert
that only the fame affinity andfocial connecti
on fnbfifted between the people of the colonies,
which fuMifted between the people of Gaul,
Britain, and Spain, while Roman provinces,
viz. only that affinity and social connection
which result from the mere cirtumftance of
being governed by the fame princeâdifferent
idea? prevailed, and gave occaiion to the Con
gress of 1774 and 1775.
The revo4utron, or rather the declaration
of Independence, found the people already uni
ted for general purposes, and at the fame
time providing for their more domestic con
cerns by State conventions, and other tem
porary arrangements.
Prom the crown of Great-Britain, the sove
reignty of their country pafi'ed to the people
of itâand it was then not an uncommon
opinion, that the unappropriated lands which
belonged to that crown, palled not to the peo
ple of the colony or States within whose li
mits they were fltuat;ed, but to the whole
peopleâon what ever principles this opinion
Felted, it did give way to the other, and
thirteen fovereigntie* were confdered as
from the principles ps the revolu
tion, combined with local convenience and
considerationsâthe people nevertheless con
tinued to consider themselves, in a national
point of view, as one people ; and they eon
tinged without interruption to manage their
national concerns accordinglyâAfterwards,
in the hqny of the war, and in th<* warmth of
mutual confide >ce,tbey mi de a confederation
of lite States the balls of a general govern
ment. Experience disappointed the expect
ations they had formed from it; and then the
jxjople, in their collective and national ca
pacity, eftabli flied the pre fen t Constitution.
It is remarkable that in establishing.it, the
people exerciftd their own rights, ai)d their
own proper sovereignty, and cgnftious of the
plenitude of it, they declared ivith becoming
dignity, â¢' We the Pea pic of the United > rates,
44 da ordain and etlablilh this Constitution,"
H'*re we fee the people acting as fove reigns
Â»f the whole, country ; and in the language of
fevereigiity, a Constitution by
:li it was their will, that the state govern.
lbould be bound, and to Â»hich the
State Constitutions thou Id be made to conform.
Every State Constitution is a com past made
by and between the citizens of a State to go
vern themselves in a certain mannerâand the
Constitution of the United States is likewise
a compact made by the people of the United
States to govern themselves as to general ob.
jedts, in a certain manner. By this great
compart however, many important preroga
tives were transferred to the national go
vernment, such as those of making war and
peace, contracting alliances, coin ng money,
&rc. &rc.
It then it be true, that tfce sovereignty of
the nation is in the people of the nation, and
the rellduary sovereignty of each State in the
people of each State, it may be ui'eful to com
pare these sovereignties with those in Europe,
that we may thence be enabled to judge, whe
ther all the prerogatives which are allowed to
the latter, are also eflential to the former.
There is reafoil to suspecT that some of the
difficultiejfchich embarrass the present quef
tion, ri epÃoni inattention to the differences
which fubiilt between them.
it will be fufficieut to observe briefly, that
Saturday, August iq, 1795. [Whole No. 44;.]
the foverdiffntierin Europe, and-particularly
in England, exill on feudal principle* T|*at
fyfteui conlklei s the ptince -is. the foreign, ajid
theP'eopfe as his {vl'jcfisâit? regards .his person j
as the object of allegiance, and excludes the
idea of his being' on an equal footln'g witft a
fubjeft, either in a court of justice or efle
where. That system contemplates him as be
ing the fountain of honor and authority â¢; and
from his grace and grant derives aJI franc-hiies,
immunities and privileges âit is cafv to per
ceive that' such a Tovefeijfn could -ct i>e aÂ«vÂ«e-
Y.aÃlfc tÂ«> a court of jurticV, or fTibje&ed to
jifdicial control? *â¢ ami atfHtal confttomt. It was
ofuecefiity, therefore, tfrat Inability became
incompatible witivfuch jCbv eieignty. Bef.des,
the N prince having 3JI the executive powers,
the judgment of the courts would, 1,1 fa<ft, be
only monitory, not mandatory to him. and a
capacity to be advised, iÂ» a diftin<ft thing iron*
a capacity to bÂ«? lued. The fame feudal ideas
run through all t!:eir jurtfprudence, <tnd con
llantly remind us of rhe distinction between
the prince and tl>e No luch ideas ob*
tain here-âAt the revolution, the foyereigiity
devolved on the people ; ;.u;J they ftt> 1 y <
tl)e sovereigns of the countryâbut tnen t:vy
are wVwt -Jmjc&'s (unless the Af
rican slaves among us may be tb catted)â-;Â»nd
have none to govern but ihonjciveiâthe citi
zens of America are equal as
and as joint tenants in the sovereignty.
From the differences exiftirg between feu
dal sovereigns, and governments founded on
compacts, it neceflarily follows that their ref
peefcive, prerogatives mud alio differ.
Sovereignly is the rijsht to govern ; a na
tion or state-sovereign is the person or persons
in whom that riÂ»fides. In Europe the fover
eigrity is generally ascribed to the princeâ
h<*Te it rests with the peopleâtliere, the fo
vereiguty actually administers the govern
ment; here, never in a single inftaneeâour
Governors are the agents of the people, and
at tnoft (land in the fame relation 10 their fo
vercign, in which regents in Enrope stand to
their sovereigns. Their princes have ptrf&nal
powers, dignities and pre-emirtencicsâour
rulers have none but official; nor do they par
take in the fbvereignty otherwise, or iu any
other capacity, than as private citizens.
2. The second ohjeCt of inquiry now pre
sents itfelf, viz. whether fuibility is incom
patible w th State sovereignty.
Suabilityâby whom ? not a fubjeCtâfor
in this country there are noneânot by an in
ferior ; for all the citizens being as to civil
rights perfectly equal, there is not, in that
respeCt, one citizen inferior to another.
It is agreed that one free citizen may sue
anotherâthe obvious dilates of jufliice, and
the purposes of society demanding jt.
It is agreed that one free citizen may sue
any number on whom process can be con
veniemtly executedânay, in certain cases,
one citizen may sue forty thousand ; for
where a c<?Vporation Is sued, all the members
of it are aftua/Jy, though riot fxrfvnalfy 9 sued.
In this city there are foTty odd thousand
free citizens, all of whom may be collectively
sued by any individual citizen. In the State
of Delaware, there are fifty odd thousand free
citizens, and what reason can be afligned why
a free citizen who has demands against them
should not prosecute them? Can the difference
between fyrty odd thousand, and fifty odd
thousand make any distinCtion $s to right f Is
it not as easy, and as convenient to the pub
lic and the parties, to serve a summons on
the Governor and Attorney-General of Dela
ware, as on the Mayor or other officers of the
Corporation of Philadelphia ?

FROM THE WESTLRN STAR.
NO art, however vileâno plan, however
wickedâno attempt, however base and
uujuftifiab'e, is left uneflayed by a detested
and abominated elan, to bring into disrepute
the measures of the Federal Government, to
fix an odium upon its administration, and'en
deavor to render our f:ee and happy -citizens
di("contented with its operations.âA Phila
delphia paper (the Manorial Gazette) has for
some time past teemed with abu'e and.u> just
inve&ive against the Executive of the Union.
âThat he' d of fcrH>blerÂ§ whose ebullitions
have been lent forth through the continent,
have worn thread-bare the infamous epithets
repeated and r e-repeated against the officers
of the General Government, without produ
cing any of the diabolical cffe&s intended.â
It might have been expe&ed that the illustri
ous Washington would have escaped the
fhafts of those traitors to the peace and hap
piness of our land ; not from any regard they
entertain for his eminent patriotism, and un
paralleled services in his country's cause, but
rather from a fear that an open and invidious
attack upon the Chief Magiflrate of the Union,
who lives in the hearts of his fellow-citizens,
would give their infamous views a too pub
lic exposition, and render abortive the object
of their hopesâBut as the great adversary of
mankjpd, after deluding his followers for a
season, it is said at length leaves in a
lurch, so his offspring at the ptefenc day, after

his friend in this town : â
" r T" , HE Pielidcnt has met a volley of the mofi
X unmerited abufc, on account of his Pro

the add reft from Saletn. has done honor to the
citizen?, aad has feived the cause of our country.
It is painful to think that any men (hould be
dcfirous of embroiling this countfy, and con
necting our affairs with ihoCe of the governments
of Europe, which are evidently hallooing to i uin,
and laboring under every evil, which vice, des
potism and fatfion can ii.flitt. Thu* we are
bound to wiih for their happmcf>, we are under
no obligation to become parties to their con
tentionsâ we ate not to imitate th ir manners,
or to adopt their opinion*, if we wiih to consult
either their of our ilUcrcfls. It would be a
lading it n<Â»t a ruinous calamity, to
permit foreign councils to rnake an iinpÂ»efli.>n

against any with any coun
try <rf Europe. It is our d.-iry to treat all with
pfr!cfct isnpartlality and with the ftriiteft justice,
and by every means in our power to arrest that

gone through the British camp,that
a pretty general salute will be fiiej
from the different cannon round
Valenciennes this day, in honoÂ» of
the King's biith day, and that tbc
bombardment will likewil'e begin
this day. The combined armies
seem determined upon expediting
the (iege of this city and of Conde,
as they have, independent of the

which in point' of number would

Abont seven o'clock in lk< even
ing, the Duke de Sicigniano, who
ai rived in this count' y about iÂ«vu
months since, being appointed to
fucceedthe PiijWt Caftelcicala, as
Miuiller from the
Court of Naples, put an end to his
exigence, by placing a hoi fe pittol
to his temple,and blowing his brains
out. Medical aililtance wa& imme
diately lent for, but the nirgeons
arrived only jnil in tijnt to fee him
expire.
As soon aÂ® the event became
known, the Prince Caftelcicala, and
fotne other foreign noblemen, wci>t
to Grenier's to view ihe body, and
ihe Prince took charge of his effects.
Oa Saturday morning, M r - Buigels,
one of his Mjjetty's under Secreta
ries of State, at the requelt of Lord
Grenville, went to the Hotel to
make tbe necefl'ary enquiries con
cerning the luicide, and to give or
ders for the removal of the corpse;
and the interment. Mr ( Burgels
was at Grenier's near three houis,
and was extremely .attentive and'
minute in the inveftigaiioii Of the
business. Ihe Court of Naples may
be allured that every reJpcrt has
been paid to this unfortunate No
bleman that ciicumftanc?s could al
low.
The Dtrke de Sicigniano was a
young Nobleman of one of the firft'
families in Italy, of very amiable
manners, and much beloved by
those who knew him.
The Count tie Merci d'Argenteau
is appointed by the Emperor to ie

of a civil nature. He is particular
ly charged with the correspondence
department of thearmies, to receive
. all propositions that may be made
. on the part of France, from whom
he holds a comuiilfion of Minister
Plenipotentiary.
This appointment of the Count
tie Merci has probably given rife to
the report ofthe Frrnce deCobourg
being about to tefign- At all events
it appears evident that the Emperor
rather chooses to depend on the
General's sword, than on his head.
The present lunation of affairs
will not admit at this moment, per
haps, of an effectual opppfition to
the aggrandizement of the Musco
vite Empire ; but as evety state in
Europe is interefled in proscribing
bounds to the power of Rulfia, we
have the stronger reafoti to lament,
that it hat been fuffered to unite
the several provinces of Poland to
its afready tooextenfive territories ;
becaofe this acceflion of dominion
mull inevitably create well founded
jealousies, and lay the ground work
of future hoftillties ; âand a war
in perfpetftive is certainly no plea
sant object to contemplate.

ift. Resolved, Tha: a ftritfl obser
vance of existing treaties, and of
neutrality enjoined bj the I'reli
dent's Proclamation, is, in our op.-
nion, among the fitft duties winch
we owe to ourselves, and tothe mild
government adopted by our ccuu<
try.
2d. Resolved, That in our opinion
it is contrary to the tenor of those
treaties, and the laws of the laiul,
to engage on board of any Letter of
Marque or privateer, or to afiitt in
arming or fitting out veilels tocruife
againit any of the puwers at war;
and that it is the duty of al) good
citizens, to unite their efforts to
bring offender* in these refpedts ttt
convi<ftionw<Â»d punishment.
3d. Resolved, That ihe Proclama
tion of the President of the United
States, declaring their neutrality' to
wards the powers at war, was in our
opinion ameafure wifely calculated
to promote the interests and prefer ve
the tranquility of oor country ; and
that we consider the fame as a new
proof of that watchful regard for
the honor and prosperity of the na
tion, which has uniformly distin
guished the a'dminiftration of our
firft inagiftrate.
4th. Resolved, That the President
of the United States is the only or
gan thro' which the national will
can be made known to foreign pow
ers; and that any attempt of (aid
powers, or their ininiliers, to com
tnunicate with this country, upon
national objeds ot hei ways 1 han thro* 1
biin, is an indignity to Â®ur con It i
t ution,an offence to the nation, and
ought to excite the apprehenfiun

The opinion of the President of the United

4< I believe the American Milieum has met
with Â©xtenfivc, I may fay, with univerlal ap
probation from competent judges ; for 1 am o?
opinion, that the work is not only eminently
calculated to dominate political, agricultural,
pnilofophical, and othtr valuable information ;
but that it has been urtijormly conduced with tape,
attention, avd propriety. II lo thefc important
