tMu Tftt HAIL.
The importance of the tufinejs agitated at the life j
facial feffioh of the Ciicuit C&tfrt in this city %Wv
ing induced the Editor to apply to a gtrxhman of
the bur* who attended the Court, for <a Jlaiement of
itâhe has an opportunity of faying before the pub
lic the following fictch oj the proceedings, which
as far as it goes rhiy be deemed accurate.
AT a special Circuit Court of the United
States, held at Philadelphia, July 22d.
(fcdetfo Henfield, was indited for having ert
tsred on board the French privateer called
tlie Citizen Genet, commifljoned to cruise a
gai 11ft certain powers with whom the United
States are at peaceâand having with others
on bnard the said privateer taken a prize a
B-itiftt veiTel called the William, his
duty as a citizen and" in habitant of tlie Unitsd
Srates, against the treaties existing between
the United States and the United Nether
lands, Prufiia and Great-Bntaiiiy and again ft
ftje law of nations, &c.
To tins he pleaded not gti'lty, and flfctrtil
#ft?h:s important iflue came on last Fnttey,
the 26ih July.
Jjp appeared inevidence that Gideon Hen
field, was a citizen of the United States, and
that his family resided ih Salem, Maflachufetts
âbeing a fea-faring man he hdtdf been absent
from them fo-.ne time, and about the firft of
May last, being then at Charleston, SoutH-
Carolina, and desirous of coining to Phila
4e.l|i>lia, he applied to the matter of a packet,
who ifked him more for his passage than he
Could arford to pay, whereupon he entered on
boa d the Citizen Genet, a French privateer,
connn'ilioned by the French Republic, and
commanded by Pierre Johannene. That
Ca ;t. J iha-inene proaiifed him the birth of
p zi mailer on board the nrft prize they
ibbuM capture, and the fliip William, belong
ing to Britith fu'ojâ ;&< having been taptu'red
ai) Â»ut the 5 hot' May, he was put on board
her as p Ka master, with another person, and
arrived in mat capacity at Philadelphia.
It appeared that on his examination before
the inagiftrate he profefled himfelf an Ame
4i6an, tnat a, inch he would d'<e, and there
fore could not be ftippoferi likely so intend any
tiling fiber declared that if he
had known it to be contra y to the Prcfident*s
proclamation, or even the wishes of the Pre
iklent, for waom be had the g eateft refpeÂ«st,
he would not have entered on board. About
4 mfouth afterwards being again before the
. flt ne magistrate, he declared that he had ef
j)ouied tlie cause of France* that he now con
sidered himfelf as a Frenchman, apd meant
to mrve his family within their dominions.
The attorney of the diftritt, aflifted by the
attorney-general of the XJaited States, con
ducted the prosecution.
Messieurs Du Ponceau, Ingerfoll and Ser
geant, appeared in the defence.
Alter the arguments .were closed, Judge
Wilson delivered a charge to the jury, in sub
stance as fallows :
This is, gentlemen of the cafe of
the firft importanceâupon your verdict the
in fiere ft s of four millions of your fellow-citi
zens may be said to dependâBut whatever
be the consequences, it is your duty, it.is our
duty, to do only what is right." . v .
He then (fated the lubftance 6f -thle charges
against the defendant, and piocccdcd
It has not been contended on the pre Tent
occasion, that the defendant has any peculiar
or exclusive right to take a part in
war between the European powers, in dela
tion to all of whom tse United Stages "aie in
â 41 Ante of perfect peace and neutrality.
If he has no peculiar nor ejtcjofive right,
it naturalty follows that what he may do, eve
ry other citizen of the United States piayall'o
doâlf one citizen of the United States m>*y
takfe a part in tlie present war, ten tootffafid
mayâlf they may take part on one lide, they *
may on the other, and thus. thoAfeiidsr" of*otjr
fellow-citizens may atibciate With â¢
diflfercnt belligerent powers, defti
only those with whom we have no hoftiiity,
but destroying each other. In fuchacaie can
we expect peace ahiong their friends wHo
behind ? and will not a ciwl war frith all its
lamentable train of evils herhenatunil effedt ?
Yet what is right unAe done, *Mrdeipen
dent of the consequences which I. have .oiily
itated, in order to lay before you the vn?celli
ty of seriously considering the cafe entmftejd
so you, before you decide upoÂ» it. â¢ â¢ "
Two principal questions of fa<ft arifsn
and lequire your determinatioti.
The firft is, that the defendant) Gideon
Henfield, has conrmittted all ast of hostility
against ihe of a power with whom
t'ae United States are at peace ; this has been
clearly eflablidied by the testimony. The
second object of enquiry, is whether at that
time Gideon Henfield was a citizen of the
United States. This he explicitly acknow
ledged to Mr. Baker, and if lie declared true,
it was at that time the leatt of bis thoughts
to expatriate himfelf.
The question of law coming into joint con
sideration with the fa&s; it is the duty of
the court to explain the law to the jnry, and
and give it to them in direction.
Wednesday, August 7, 1795-
It i*' thd joint aÂ«d unstoiwWsfJKnMrt*
court, thit the Ufiited4Â»tstÂ»j bÂ»Wif Â« Â» ftiflfe
of neotralitv, relative to the prefeut war, f|;e,
aetsof hoftHity committed by Gideon lien
field, \+&re an olfeoce again# this country,
and punifliable by the laws of this countrv.
It has been a&ed by his conniel i?Â» their
address to p&li. a gain It' Wfiat law has he oi
fended ? The answer i<s again# many laws,
binding laws. As a citizen ol the United
States, he was bound to ast no part which
coufd injure the nation, he was bound to keep
tfttf peacte in Regard to all nations, with whom
we are I'.i peace. This vs the law of nations,
not an cxpofl fact* law* but a law which was
iti exileenCe long before Gideon Henfield ex
ifted. There are also positive laws exiting
previous to the offence committed, and ex
pressly decfarfcdf to be part of the supreme
Of the Tand. The conffitition- of tft'e
Uftited State* ha* declared that all
made or to be made, under the authority < i
the United States, lhal! be part ot the ffc
preme law of the land. I will Hate *<> you
gentlemen, so much of the several treaties in
force b&tWetfiY America, ami" any of the pow
ers at War with France, as applies to the
pre Tent cafe.
The firft article of the treaty with the
United Netherlands declares that there lha'l
be a firm, inviolable and umverfal peace, and
i! nee re friendfhip between the States General
6f the United Netherlands and the United
States of .1 nerica, and between the fnbject's
and inhabitants of the said parties.
.The seventh article ot the dt feiitive treaty
of peace between the United States and
Great-Britain declares that there shall be a
frrin and perpetual peace bfetwetfn his
Majertv ants the United States, and betvs'ten
the fubjeÂ«>s of the one and the citiaefls of the
other.
And the fivft article of the treaty with
PruflTa declares that there fliall be a firm, in
violable and univeilal peace and Si net re
friendship between his Majesty tte King of
Prulfia,' and his fubjefts on the one part, ard
the United States of America and their citi
zens on the other.
11 may be obleryed that the treaty would
not be less fufficient in relation to the present
qu:2ion lit" " fuhjects" and " citizens" had
nrft been Mentioned.
Thele treaties were irt the niofl 1 public, ttie
ntoft notorious eniffer.ee befoie the ast for
which the prisoner is indi&cd was committed.
Tiie notoriety may indeed be said to. have
been greater than that of the general a&s of
CongrefS|.fince besides the fanM mode of (pub
lication, they are exprtfkly referred to in tbe
Conftifirtiort.
Much h& bern fati On this OCCaficlii by the
defendant's cOtanfel, irt support of the naturil.
rijht of emigration, but little of it is truly
applicable to the prarent queilioil.
JitmSratii'ii is undoubtedly one of tfie na
tural rights of man. Yet it does not follow
stum thence that every ais intfonflAent wirt
the du.ty, it inConlUtent with tbi Site of a.
citizen.
Nothing is inore incocififtent with the duty
of a citizeo than treafoM ; but it is Ijecaufc

puftifflhient.
AfgrTOflie other obfervationj explanatory
of th? legal princip es which ha r d been agita
ted in tl.e course of the tiial, ttie judge con
c ! uiied by remarking that the jury in a gene
ral verdict must decide, both liÂ» and fact, but
itfcat this did not authoflft? therm to decide it
as ffiey pleased ; thfcy were as much bound
to decide by law as the judgesâtbe responsi
bility .w'as equal upon both.

tan. Fit k.o,
THC writer under tie fignatnre of " Phi
lanthropy,vho fiirntflted t!>e article in
vnnr Gazette of tlie 241 th instant, on the
j<?ft of the Borough of Eafton, has afl'umed a
title which but- illy corresponds with tlie Spirit
01 tendency of his publication; for, whatever
humour there may be in it, there is certainly
not a sprinkling either of good nature or good
manne/s. Otherwise, he w6nld not have in
voked in the fame stupid jest tlie Negro and
a rsfpeclable Citizen, valuable in hi-; Nation,
as a member of forietv, whole urlfan'ty of
disposition. it I mistake not, has induced many
acts of politencfs and hoSpitafity to the author
oftfiat piece; but where is the wit who will
not Sacrifice his friend to his joke ?
Me has, however, meditated a more seri
ous and ineXcusable injury, when he bai made
an entire community the ohjeft of his far
calms, and when fie has wantonly endeavored
to Check the growing prosperity of a town,
which, if Me, fhouid rather be encouraged
depre.'fed j hut which, 011 the contrary,
he knows to polfefs great natural advantages,
to be the nii't for the produce of an exrer.five
cau&try, to be already comparatively popu
lous and wealthy, and to be daily and rapidly
intreafing, *s well in population, as in manu
faffurfrs and tnrrprove inert ti of every kind.â
When he Vouched for the authenticity of the
information he grtfe' you, he (Wtild not have
involved the whtjle focietv in the guilt of a
few malic-ion* and iriligriifrcant individuals.
He should have told you that the disgraceful
burtiiOfs he mention*, originated in tlie ma
lignity of a pet ulsnt yonng man, who had been
obtruded upon this town as a juftiee of the
peace, contrary to the general with ; that it
was conducted with profound secrecy, and
was Supported by the inftrÂ»mentality of a few
persons, either too young to reflect, or too
ignorant to judge for them elvÂ»s; that the
ltroke was llruck before it was even fuSpeft
ed ; and that therefore, there was neither
" seal nor spirt" of exertion at the election,
which was too unimportant in its object to
excite general attention, and from that rcaSon
only could have fumilhed the occaGon which
has called forth the humour of your PhiUn-
Ihrcpijl. And above all, instead of averting
the contrary, he Ihou'.d have told you, that
such an outrage 011 decency failed of its pur
pose, and that a very reputable inhabitant
was ilul v retu ned and qualified to the execu
tion of his office.

Fellow Citizen t y
THE principles recognized by your focety
being among tbofe on which our free and
happy Const .tution is founded, no true Re
publican will hesitate to fub'cfibe to them.
We join you also most cordially in opinion,
that at this crisis it is more particulaily the
dutv of every individual to use his otmuft ef
forts to remove the prejudices and conciliate,
the atfe&ions of all our tallow citizens; and
that, to obtain the<e most deferable objects, it
tie love's all to cultivate on all occafiom
peaÂ£e, order, harmony and atiay menl to the Con
flitution ; and, hav ng-the general weitare only
iu view, fedu otiflv to avoid fven the appear
ance of party diftin&ions. But we cannpt
refrain, fellow citizens, from enpif ffims MÂ»r
apprebenfions rhat po'irical tocieties,branched
out and alTuming powers to the extent you re%
commend, may, however pure and well iiv
fentioned in their commencement, be per
verted into clubs of fiction, as has been too
often experienced, and terminate at length
icrCourts of tnquifitian. We apprehend that a
dread at lead of such coufeqnences will at any
rate e*cite heart-burning t and Jiffcritionsâi-xXaX
precursors of Anarchy, and its invariable fol
io We râDijptftifn.
We are happv in the con vision t hat the
citizens of the United Stares, who of their
own free choice have adopted theCouftitnriou
under which we enjoy PeaceÂ»- hb rty and Jr.de
pevdence, are fully competent, by the modes
pre limbed by that Conlttrntion, to correct the
abuses which may and will, from time to t m<,
ceep into this and all other human ifiJiirtiVat/u
We are happy also in the conviction, that the
citizens of our fee independent Republic can,
without being driven to the necefllty of fonv*-
ing themselves into fociet es or parties (pro
per at certain times for Jubjefts of n&htrthical
ami ilefboti'c Â£;oVernrnentr, where the corre<stiow
, exf abufeJ or change of public men cannot
othftrwife be brought about) approve and Â«*id
those whole valor, virtue and patriotism, con.
ttibuted to procure and continue to pi el rVe
to lis t're bteffings of Peace, Librrtx and ludepeti
dence, and can by cOnJlitutioit a J modti tbo, dMcoun
tenoiVce or pnhifli their public ffcrvanti of a
contrary description, and change the whole
fyftfm of government, when they judge it
proper to do so.
We are more particularly aver r e at this
time to the appearar.ee of party difti ft ions,
which too often end in civil difTentions, being
deepfv affected by the horrid maflacres and
devastations recently experienced by our in
ftilar friends, with whom we sincerely sympa
thize 011 the melancholy occasion We depre
cate the like dreadful calamities, which will
inevitably delude our common country,
pa r ty differences fever the fraternal ba* d and
diflolve the Unionâthat barrier wh ch alone
can fa<fre us from the miseries of civil discord,
and its certain domina
tion. it M Union ulone that can continue to us
the peace and honors of an Independent, and the
happiness oj a Republican Govtrnmtnt.
We are, with great refpeft,

They began by reading the following extract

The commiflioners charged by the general

thrown so many obstacles in the

beat.back, and, at last, succeeded
no farther than in getting pofleilion
of the wood. The entrenchments
011 the hill were abandoned by the
enemy on the morning of the 24th

FROM IHE (BOSTON) MIRCURY.
A CORRESPONDENT observes, that the
mcafuie of calling together the General
Court, in the mid ft' ofhai vest time, however
inconvenient it may be to the members, is
arrnCt which goes beyond all the farmer exer
tions of patriotism, which have been display
ed by thefupteme executive officer of the
State, through hi| lonjÂ£ and laborious life.
That the Goverwor of MaiTachufetts fhouJd
be roused from his peaceful (lumbers in the
chair of State, by.the service of a bill in equity
is a/i offence so attrocious as calls for the
whole force of the Legislature to avenge the
injury. That the Commonwealth oj Maffachujctts
Ihoiild bt compelled to comply with the la\Vs
of jvfiice and equity as much as a single citizen,
would be a principle so dire&ly repugnant jo
the fovcrfignty of the State, that no fort of in
convenience or expense can be an objsÂ«st in
companion with that.of* resisting such an uiuf
patjon.âDoes n.Tt every body know that Jb*
vtrognly copfifts i 1 doing injujlice with impuni
ty ? Has it not in all ages been one of the dar
ling prerogatives of royal fovereigntf, and
is not republican sovereignty entitled to the
Tight of doing wrong without answering for
as much as any crowned villain that ever ex
ited ? Considered in every point of view,
tiie calling upon a sovereign Commonwealth
todo justice, and to be equitable towards a sin
gle individual, the fumrftaning of five hunÂ«
died thousand men, to deal fairly with one,
and worse than all, the indignity offered to
the MajeJly of the Commonwealth, by serving
a legal process upon its servant, is an ast of
such audacious abfnrdity, and o4* such aiatii)-
ing tendency, that nothing lefc than tile vif
dom of the legislature, invigorated by-the In
dignnnt relentmeut of the chief inagiftrate,
can be competent to avert the impending ca
lamity.
It has indeed been fa'd that the personal
affront, mail neceiTarily be theonly motive,
upon which the Genera! Court are called to
gether, at a period when the prefeiice of the
worthy agricultural members is lo necessary
to their own farms. Because as far as lef.
peCVs the interest of the State itfelf, the ques
tion involved in this tranfaftion, hasalieady
during two lucceflive felfions been before the
Legillature, and they have thought proper to
poitpone the consideration of the fubjeft untjl
their next Winter SefGon. But it is very ea
sy to discover whether there is not a fophiftn,
lurking under the plausible fuggeflion. The
truth is that the personal irritation of the
executive officer can at molt be considered
only as a ftimulous to rouse the Legislative
body from their apparent torpid indifference,
upon this momentous affair, and if they have
rhougit the general question whether the
State will be amenable to justice ? Deserving
of their future consideration, when the
wounded lleprefentative of the dignity of the
state brings tlie consequences of the obnoxioni
principle of compulsory justice, so clcjfely
home to our elves, they will readily precipi
tate the deliberation.

French colouis which (he had wore in her for
rri r manceuV rings, and hoiiiing her Englilli co
lours, fired a broadside without bailing the other
'(hip. The Ambuscade returned the fire, carried
away the Boston's crbfs jack yard, and passed
by. The Boston then tacked again and came
under the Ambuscade's lee quarter, wheii the

The Merchants and others, inhabitants of ihe
town of Beverly, MafTachufetts, have pÃ<fed sun
dry resolutions expreflive of a full approbation
of the President's Proclamation of Neutrality.
The Committee appointed to distribute relief
to,the diftrefled French Emigrants from the Cape;
REPORT, That upwards of 600 have alrea
dy arrived in Philadelphia from sea and fiom
Baltimore.
That 239 have been relieved in a very tempo
rary manner.
About 6 have been sent to the hospital under
the fecurit v of the com mittee for board, &c.
About 80 have been lodged, under hke secu
rity for board.
About 60 equally diftrcfled with the former,
but having juit an ived, have not been, but will
be relieved.
About 100 have had employments procured
tor them ; buj small advances for cloaihing was
absolutely nerefiary.
The sum a&ually expended is a6co dollars.
The committee have rhicfly confined their relief
to fubfiftcn t ce for 15 day?, which is near expir
ing; they have procured lodgings tor the great
est part on very moderate terms ; they have
taken pains to avoid impositions, and to give,
onlv to those really diftieffed.
Besides the above enumerated, the committee
report, that 800 dollars has Wen diftnbilled by
the Frenrh Patriotic Society ; their fund bein#
exhausted, many of the objetts of it must apply
to the commitu-e.
Macy who had favtd Tome small matter of
property have not yet applied, but their fund
being small, they must soon have recourfeto the
committee.
They report generally, that (hey have in pur
suit of this duty, been witness to the greatest
scene of distress that can be conceived, and can
not but recommend that the fubferip: on be

Who arc the prrfons that clamour in favor of
a government of laws, & not of ? Anfwei â
They are those who glory in the infufts which
the laws and their administrators receive at the
hands of the avowed enemies of borh. -
Who are the peifons who toajl principles and
not men ? AnswerâThey are thereby men who
fly in the ffce of principles, whenever their ope
ration contravenes their ambitious proje&s.
Who are the persons that fay they like the
Constitution of the United States, hut dislike
the administration of thi Government ? Answer,
They arc the v<ry men who exerted themfelve*.
to the utmost, to prevent the adoption of the
Constitution ; but iiilce that event took place,
conceive that their merits have not been properly
rewarded by posts of honor and profit under the
Government.
Who are the men that fay Â«â¢ the voice of the
people is the voice of God," and that reprefen
taiion is the vital principle of republicatiifm ?
AnswerâThey are the very peifons who have
reviled, abused and infuhed the President and
Vice President of the Uuited States, the majority"
of both Houses of CongrMs, the freely
elected Representatives of the Peopleâand
this they have been continually employed in do
ins for more than four years pastâand after re
pcatedc/cfliens made by the sovereign people.
