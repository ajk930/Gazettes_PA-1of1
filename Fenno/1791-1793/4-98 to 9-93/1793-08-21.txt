A NAT.ON.II. lAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 34, NORTH FIFTH.STRErET, PHILADELPHIA.
[No. 128 of Vol. IV.]
FOR Tat GAZZTTE^
TO THE PEOPLE;.
f T"*HE disco very lately made in citycon-
X cerniog political writers is of a nature
so extraordinary that it should he understood
by every good citizen, for it may induce him
to examine with caution the invectives that
are dlfcharged every day from particular
prefTes against tire reputation of confidential
officers. The nation has observed with afto
nifhmeot during the last three months the tor
rent of abuse that has been poured out against
the President and the chief officers of govern-
ment. They have been treated as men who
deserve no confidenceâmen who are ready to
facrifice the fhfety and honor of the nation.
"When we enquire What is their crime, it cen
ters in the late proclamation. The Pi efident
issued that Proclamation, and the' Other exe
cutive officers have been uniformly endeavor
ing to preserve a ft rift neutrality ; hence
those complaints. Let lis travel along the
country from one end to the other ; acrOss it
from the sea coast to the wilderness, and the
general cry is u Peace, Peace ! Let us p're
ierve Peace and we shall be hapjÂ»y." The
nation being thus disposed, how fhouid it hap
pen, that a great proportion of our political
writers should be furioufly clamorous and in
decently outrageous against the executive for
attempting to preserve the Peace ! This pa
radox will be fully explained by considering
that much noise may be made by a few indi
viduals, that a single factious citizen or a
stranger who is no citizen, by writing under
different fignattires may raise much dust and
loom, like an host of combatants. It should
also be coiifidered that in every city there are
men who are pleased with a conflagration ;
on every coast there are men who a<e pleased
with a shipwreck, and in every State there
are men who are pleased with wars and revo-
lutions, betau'e they may by those means have
an opportunity of plundering. To the c.a
motir that may be excised by factions citizens
we mufl add the peftftential meafores that
may l>e attempted by foreigners, and we
shall not be surprised that the thunder of op
pofitiou has seemed to (hake the foundations
of government. Whether we had bef't be the
dupes of forergn influence, whether we are in
capable of governing ourselves and have need
of wiser help, are queihons for the consider
ation of a serious hour ; tlie only thing to be
coiifidered at this hour is the clear and positive
pfoof we have received that foreigners are
interfering in the adminiftrafion of our go
vernment ; that they are attempting to turn
out some of the principal executive officers,
for 110 cause that we can discover, but be
cause those officers arc desirous to preserve
neutrality -and peace. Though our courts
have been somewhat Inrfulted, where ftridt
neutrality has been recommended by the
judges, we do not btar that any attempts
have been inside to funercede those judge l !,
probably because their places aie not to be af
fected by the breath of faftiott>
1 have intimated th\t their uniform endea
vors topfeferve peace is the reason why at
tempts are made to degrade and cashier our
executive officers. This is certainly the
ir;<Â« reason, for the ostensible reasons offered
by their political adversaries are so contempt
ible that 110 body in his sober senses can pass
them f.Â»r reasons. Two questions lately ap
peared in the General Adve-rtife-r addreiled to
" two great men, one a piece."â-The questions
were to the following import, viz. " Whether
" he, one of whose companions is a man who
" was employed by the French King to bribe
" the National Convention and Tan off with
" the motley is a proper-perjon lobe at the head
"oj the finances?" ââ¢' What ihouid we think of
" a man to whom a late general officer in the
<l French army would dare to cry out in ex
" ultation, that St. Domingo was ruined.â
" Ji he not too much delighted in dejolatiun to di
" red a war f"
The reader (hould be informed that a
French gent'einan lately arrived in Philadel
phia, bringing with him large funis of money
tobe veiled in American lands. This gen
tleman brought with him letters of intro
duction from sundry refpeftable persons, he
had letters among orhors to the Secretary of
tlie Treasury, at whose house he was leen
two or three times, and with whom he then
and there conversed, for which reason, it
Teems, Hie Secretary ought to he cashiered
left he (hould rob theTreafiiry !
The reader fh'ould also be informed that
the Viscount dc Noailles,in conversation with
General Knox, with whom he served in the
late war, wds heard to exclaim emphatically,
St. Domingo h ruined,âThe fays hexx
claimed but unfoi tunately for the
veracity of the querist the Viscount is known
to have extended to the unfortunate fuffercrs
of St. Domingo unequivocal proofs ef sympa
thy. Suck my fellow-citizens are the reasons
for which two executive officers ought to be
degraded in order to make way for other per
fonsof a more proper kidney, more flexible
and more fitted to the purposes of the writer.
Our curiolity is naturally excited to know
Mho is the psrfon or petloas Co ardently de
W ednesday, August 21, 1795*
broui of regulating* otir government: and
tii*fiirÂ»gKTOtÂ» oik ojfteers. The Viicoiwit de
Noailles very happily has enabled us toanfwer
this question. He was displeased at.the insult
offered to his humanity, he called on the
Printer and demanded his aurhor. He was
allured that he was not the person; but Gen.
Knox: intended to be hurt by tiÂ»e query.râAs
it* Gen. Knox could be criminal in hearing
what the other might Jay without of&nce.
The Viscount however was not fatisfied with
this fine diftitt&ion, he insisted to have the
Kiitho and in due time he was informed that
the questions-were written by the Secretary
of Mr. Genet, the French Mioifter.
If we nf.r/ suppose that.Mr. Genet fees and
approves of ti;e political tÂ±C:\yx ot* his Secre
tary, or that those eiTays are his own, wetnuft
for the fake of system admit, that he is ready
to recommemf other Officers in the place of
those whom<he turns out- And if we might
suppose, a cafe not improbable, that thePre
iident is indebted to the fame pen for some of
the extraordinary rcifiatk* on his Proclama
tion, it would naturally follow, that a fo
reigner, harcfly four months in America, is
willing to take upon himfelf the trouble of
governing the country.
From the New- York DAILY ADVERTISER.
BY the twenty-third article of the treaty
of amity and commerce, between the
United States and France, it is declaredâ
" Art- 23 It shall, be lawful for all and
fingjular, tbg Avbjefts of the mod christian
king, and she citizens, people and inhabitants
of the said United States, to fail with their
ships, witH all-manner of liberty and security,

etoi s â¦f the merchandizes laden- thereon, from
any pott to the places of those who now are
or hereafter fhajl be at enmity with the most
christian king;, or the United Stares. It fhaJl
likewise be lawful for the Aibjefts and inha
bitants afor-efard, to fail with the ships and
merchandizes aforementioned-, and trade with j
the fame liberty and security from tfie places, ;
ports and havens of those who are enemies i
of both or either party, without any oppofi-; i
tion or disturbance whatsoever, not only di
rectly from the places of the enemy afore
mentioned to neutral places, but also from
one place belonging to an enemy to another
place belonging to an enemy, whether they be
under the jurifdidlion of the fame prince, or
under several. And it is hereby stipulated,
that free ships fliall also give a freedom to
goods, and that every thing shall be deemed
to be free and exempt, which shall be found
on board the ships belonging to the fubjefts ot
either of the confederates, altho' the whole
lading, or any part thereof, should appertain
to the enemies of either, contraband goods
being always excepted. It is also agreed in
like manner, that the fame liberty be extend
ed to persons who are on board a free ship,
w>th this effect, that although they be enemies
to both or either party, they are not to be ta
ken out of that free ship, unless they are sol
diers, and in actual service of the enemies.
By the 24th article, it is declared that this
liberty of navigation and commerce (hall ex
tend to all kinds of merchandizes, excepting
those only which are diftinguifhedby the name
of contraband, fee.
In the Daily AdvertiTer of August the firft
âis contained the following
Decree of the National Convention, May 9.
Art. I. Ships of war and privateers are
authorized to ieize and carry into the ports of
the republic, merchant veffets which are
wholly, or ill part, loaded with provisions be
ing neutral property, bound to an enemy's
port, or having on board merchandize belong
ing to an enemy.
Art. 2. Merchandize belonging to the ene
my is declared a lawful prize, feizable tor the
piofit of the captor ; provisions, beiwg neu
tral property, (hall be paid for at the price
they would have fold for at the port where
they were bound, fee.
It also appears by the papers that our ves
sels, having British merchandize on board,
have been captured by French fliips of war,
and the merchandize confifcated.
We have as yet no evidence of the authen
ticity of the above decreeâor of thole cap
tures, but such as is fnrnHhed by newfpnpers.
These are unquestionably not that kind of
tettimony which could claim the serious at
tention and operation of governmentâbut if
these things are true, and certainly the cen
curunce of circumstances furnilhes too much
reafoo to fear that they are; then the French
government have by a deliberate judicial act,
been the firft to violate a solemn treaty : in
the molt material refpeft, in which our com.
mercial interest could be affected, and it is
raid that insurance on our vefTels, role imme
diately above one hundred per .centâsuch
was the credit given to it by the merchants.
And if it is Irueâwhat does it proveâ
why that there is 110 faith, or binding force,
upon independent communities, farther than
their interest is concerned.

Burlington, County, New-Jersey.
TICK font imentVr of free ri nims. npon-tiie-.
ineafures of their government on inte
resting or eiubarrafling octafiiou-s, are of the
greatest importance, both to the liberty of
tfie citizen and the operation of the govern
ment : ihiprefTi d'with tlftt idea, the citizens
of the county of Burlington, embrace the op
portunity presented by the fitting of the cir
cuit court in their county, and the pre fence
of a large number of their most relpe<slab!e
members, convened from every part of the
county, to take into confederation the procla
mation of the President of the United States,
and the Vice-President of this state, relative
to the neutrality of the United States of Ame
rica, in the present European warâWhere
upon, an hour having been appointed for the
meeting of the citizens, and they having met
accordingly at the Court-house of the said
county, on Tuesday the 13th August, 1793Â»
and having appointed
General Joseph Bloom field, Chairman of
the said meeting,
It wis uiianirnoufly Refnlved,
id. That the 1 republican citizens of the
comity of BnrJingten, are highly impreffwl
with the policy and justice of the measures
recommended by the faiH proclamation,.which
declares to the people, the supreme law ps the

tween the belligerent- powers and thefc Uni

affad finally in the linp of hi? dury, arc]

2d. That the citizens of the county of Bur

warme-ft zeal, co-operate in every legal way
âto detect and pujiifli offenders again ft the
right* of neutralityâjind by all means in their
power discountenance designs or pioceedings
calculated to inteirupt that tranquility and
happ'inefs, which the citizens of the United
States enjoy, under a pure and pacific admi
nistration of the government.
And further it is the opinion of this af
fcrehlaÂ»ge of citizens, r&at as the highest pri
vilege of these United States consists in their
republican form of federal governmentâas
the only legi-tiniate source of thi* government
is .the peopleâas they are only the proper
persons to ele& and appoint tbofe who are to
carry it into operationâAnd to judge of the
official conduit of their magistrate*âso any
interference in the internal administration
of the government, by any foreign power or
minister, is an infringement oi tie sovereign.

QUERIES.
Whether, tl the United States, under the
Â»2d article of the treaty ot amity md commeice
with Fiance, arc bound to admit the fitting out
ef French privateers, to the exclusion ojail others,
when Franve 19at war, and the Untied State* ate
neutral, Fiance is not equally bound, >>1
United States (hould be at war, and France
iliould be neutral, to admit the fitting out ot
American the txtlujxov oj alt others ?
2. Whether, if such be the coullruetion ol that
article of ihat treaty, a similar couftruflion mull
not be given to the r.5 l h aÂ» lielc ol the tieavy
above mentioned, and the 16th article ot the
treaty Of 1786, belween Fiance and Great-Bri
tain. those articles being substantially the fame
with the 22d article of the treaty of amity and
commerce between the United States and
France ?
3. Whether, therefore, in cafe when the ob
ligation of thofc treaties was in full force, a war
had taken place between Great-Britain and the
United Sta'.es,"atui France had been neutral, the
corifequence of such a conitiufiion would not
have been, that France was bound bv htr trea
ties with Great-Britain to admit the /lUiug out oj
Britijh, to the excUJion oj American privdt<e>> ; and
by the treaty with the United States to admit
-it., fittim ir giitjqÂ£ Amet ican, to .the cxclufioft.of\Blitifh
privateer* r â '
4. Whether that confttu&ion of those trea
ties be so neceflary and unavoidable, as to
juflify a charge of such duplicity upon one of
the contra&ing powers, and of the .grofleft folly
upon >he others, finer the treaties of Utrecht and
o f 1763 were well known before the treaty of
1778 was entered into, and that ot 1778 long
before the treaty of 1786 ?
5. Whether, it the conftruÂ£lion be in other
tefpefls doubtful, such a one ought not to be
given, as is conlillent with the fuppofitton of
good faith in an ally to whom we owe such great
obligations, and ol a little prudence and com
mon f nfe in perfnns who were never remarka
ble for wanting either ?
FhiUdelphia, Augujl 16, 1793.
From the Columbian Centinel.
Mr. Russel,
WHENlfawa prophetic intima
tion in your last Centinel, that
we might soon expedt to haÂ»e some of our
citizens denounced by a Jacobin Club, or
in the Jacobin mode ; I little thought
that the predi&ion would be verified in
the fame week. But the Jacobin party
in every country are so ardent, and are
in the habit so strongly of marching with
a quick step to the tune of Ca Ira, that
they progress much falter than we expec
ted. Their impetuofuy is so great, that
even here, they seem to proscribe with as
much facility and expedition, as they do
in Paris ; and may perhaps, sentence and
execute our citizens with as much celcii
ty as they have done in France. On
Thursday afternoon eleven of our ciii
zeru, some of whom are of the utmod
rsfpeftability in town, were denounced,
and their names displayed in large letters
on the mainmast of the French frigate
now in this harbour, as Aristocrats, un
friendly to the French revolution, and a
verse to having American citizens enter
on board French privateers. This was
the crime said to be dated on the paper
above the names j and it was confirmed
to be the crime for which they were de
nounced, by one of the officers of the
frigate to Americans who were on board.
Now, Mr. Rtiflel, I wi(h the noted
Expositor of laws and treaties, the would
be Marat for this Department, to (hew us
by what article of our treaty with France
the Fiench naval officers, or the agents
of the Jacobin Club in Paris, have a right
to proscribe our citizens, because.they
wish to live in peace with all the world.
The prediction in ynnr CentJnel of lad
I Weuucfday is now fuihlied. Eleven of
out citizens are now proscribed, and their
names announced on boatd the frigate,
becanfe they wi(h to preserve our neutra

so to know what is to be their punish
ment, and who are to execute it ? Ate
they to fuffet by the .Lamp Cord or the
Guillotine here, or ar.t tbey to be sent in

not the latter, why was the profcHptiSVi
firft announced on boaid the French fri

was not process made in our own mode,
and through the medium of our owÂ«,
laws ?
Has the boaftcd freedom of American
citizens come to thisâhas our valued li
berty so foorÂ» funk to a Hate of vassalage
to an European nation ! What other fo
reign nation, since the revolution, has
aflumed such a power over us ? And is
this to be viewed as evidences of their
friendliiip as allies, or their love of liber

Have we no charaÂ£ler as Americans,
no laws, no government of our own, that
we mud be called to a foreign tribunal ?
Is it laudable and virtuous sot us to insult
the President and a!) others who adminis
ter the government of the Union ; and is
it criminal to be advocates for peace, and
promoters of public tranquillity and hap

what a perverlion of all good principles, J
of common sense, and of moral recti

But fear not, Mr. Ruflel, though you

they will yet probably fufFer by the naps,
which they have prepared for others.

present their compliments to the captain
of that fliip, and request liim to enquire
ahd inform them through the Centinel,
who it was that did it, or by whose direc

the objedt in doing it. They are inform
ed and believe, that the Captain had no
knowledge of the ast when done, and
was displeased with and reprobated it.â
But they know of no channel so clear and
direct of coming at the agent, as through
the officers of the {hip.

her lower deck, inainmatt and fore
1110ft gone, her remaining fails torn
to pieces, and 6 feet water in her

worth an effort : by the extraordi

crew of the Nancy (only J men and
a boy) she was pumped dry,fome re

The /hip is about 200 tons ; her car

to be one of the Jamaica fleet, which
failed in June. A Jamaica news

ExtraSs from a Madr't l paper of tie 14th

" His has teceived by an ex

mention that on the 6th inft. at 9 o'clock
in the morning, he ordered an attack up
on the enemy, who were polled up in 3
mountains almolt inacccflible. Alter a
very bloody engagement of 4 hours, our
troops dislodged the enemy, and placed
therafelves in their positions taking from
them Fort Pinon, and purfutd them as
far as the village of Otiznn, which was
occupied by the rear of their army whete
our Gen. ordered his troops to reft & eat

they did inthefame camp and in the fame

" At the time tlr? expiefs set off, oilr
Gen. was not able to ascertain the num
ber of killed and -wounded on either fide
but Gen. Qciirier who commanded the
tear of the French army, arid was taken
prisoner, declared that the {laughter had
been very great in his army.
" GiOi Caro adds that our troops made
the attack with the greatest intrepidity
and valour ; for 4500 men dislodged
4000 from positions almost impregnable,
that even for 20,000 men it would have
been thought a glorious action.

otherwise no capitulation would be

sent their conditions, which our general
refufedâthe rtt stipulated that the gar

YOU are anthovized to inform the public,
that the armies ot Spaiii, in Catalonia, on
the i6tti nl Apiil enietcd France by the
province of Rouliilon. From tbat time till
the 34th of May, they had beat the French
aimies in several engagements, in which the
forces were equal, and c-ven inferior" to the
latter: that the had taken from
the French by force of arm';, the towns of
Geret and Argeles, together with the fort of
Maiden, with several pieces of artillery, am
munition, arms, two flags, and killed from
3 to 410, 230 wounded, 280 drowned iu fritf"

prifonei s. That the town of St.Lorencc ,
Cii(Ja, and 21 villages of the French 'fcerdii

ly to the Catholic armies, with the ringing of
bells, found,ot music, and loud
of long live the kii.g of Spain.
That the May, the other aimy in Na
vane enreied France by the province of Gaf
conia, dislodged the French armv off the
eminence 011 which they were and en
camped themselves thereon; they beat the
French and put them to a piecipitate flight,
and poirefled themselves of the town of Sua.
They were equally beat back in the pro
vince of A'agon, when the French attempt
ed to enter in to Spainâand until that date,
the only advantage the French obtained, was
the taking of the very inconsiderable places
of Sarraganundy and U'dax.
The admiral of the Spanifli fleet, doll Fran
cisco de Borl'a, whom his Catholic maj'ffy

HAMHURCH, JUNK '
u The Germin rtc'wfpjipert| I fend yon,are
intended for one of your new/paper printers
in making uPe of them, I roust remark, it
will be necessary to observe that they are for
ced almost ali to be partial against the French ;
and that their boasted vi&ories are neither
so decisive, nor so gÂ»eat, as is related. The
war wastes terribly in lives and money, and
the Emperor and Prussia are almost exhausted
in point of finances. Unhapp ly those mis
chievous New-Jacobins do all to promote
and second the measures of the German and
other conspired princes. Marat, lloberfpierie
and Danton, are really the gÂ«eateft enemies
of France. But their party begins to fall;
and is entirely dv ftroyed at Mai feille*, Bour
diaux, &c. only Paris and Lyons support it."
This is in a great degree a confirmation of
the extract of a letter from Bordeaux, given
in our last. It appears from these two [hat a
change must have taken place in the general
politics of France, since the date of our last
detailed accounts. We are tempted to im
agine, from what we have been able col
lect, that probably, the violent minority oi'
the Convention, whose influence is predomi
nant in Paris, may have imprudently ufeel
force against their opponents, and that the
departments well asserted to the cause of ra
tional republicmifm, finding thedignity of the
National Conveneion in fu I ted, and the rights
of the majority impaired by violence, may
have used strong measures to restrain t(ie fac
tious in the capital ; but our belief cannot
carry us to fear, for one moment, that the
causa of limited monarchy could poflibly find
any number yf advocates in France.
The iloop A'odia, which had gone,down the
Ohio to New Orleans, and there rook a Spa
nish regiiler, was taken on her pafl'age to Phi
ladelphia by the Petit Democrat, and sent
ko as a prize to this port, together with the
sloop Hope of Antigua, taken by the Genet.
Both of these prizes were seized by virtue oi'
an order from the Executive of the United
States, directed to governor Mifflin, and a
guard of Militia took pofleffinn of them ; and
on Saturday evening the Alodia was reltored
to the uivner, who is a citizen of the United
States- It is expected that the Hope will
likewise be relfored to her owners, as by tiie
late decilion of the Prefideilt, no prizes can
be legal, that fliall be taken by any of the five
French privatrers mentioned in the Circular
Letter to the Collectors.
In conlequence of orders given to the mi
litia at Fort Mifflin, tliey have seized the brig
Oavofa which had been sent op there a prize
to the Democrat.

A correspondent \n Mr. Dunlap's paper cf
Monday lays, that as the bone of contrition
ig taken atvay, five of the French privateers
being proscribed, it is to be hoped, tiiar any
tii r rhÂ«r clamours against the French nation
wilTceale; indeed we must allow, that the
â¢ Convention in their Decree which excepts
American bottoms from being examined by
their ihips and cruizers, have a&eda wife and
friendly part ; and the accommodating difpojition
of Mr, Genet, since his arrival in America,, has
deserved the approbation of all men, who are
not cafe hardened against the cause of liberty.
His eondoft in regard to the restoration of
the (hip Grange, and in several other instan
ces/ has proved the truth of the aflertio<n.
In the fame paper, the fame paragraphia,
injmojher column, speaking of the repealing
the Decree of the National Convention of the
9th" May (which is a palpable violation of the
treaty) by a fubfeqnent Decree of the 23d
May, fays that this proceeding is 4,4 gencrdus
on the part of France and addsâSuch con
fid'erations as thei'* must have some effe<Tt in
flopping the torrent of abuse, now pouring
forth against every Frenchman, and against
every patriot of the world, by the enemies of
liberty, who have iecured to themlelves a
in the United States.
What is intended by u clamours against
the French," it is not difficult to determine,
âHad the government of the United States
permitted certain persons to proceed in their
iwiparellelled insults, and violations of neu-
bad the people refrained from ex
prefling their approbation of the measures
adopted by government,topreferve the peace,
Jibe rty and independence of the United States,
we should not have heard of " clamours a -
garnft the French."âClamours against the
people and government of this country have
disgraced several of the public prints of the
United States, for several months pastâ-but
we have heard no remarks (iinilar to the
above from this zealous paragraphift.
We hav< heard of a Decrec of the. National
Convention of France, of the g(h May, evident
ly violating an eflential article of the treaty be
tween France and the United Siates. That such
a Decree was palled, there can be no doubt, as
the conlcqnenccs have been experienced by the
commercial inten fts of this country. But it is
now said (from what authority does not appear,
as neither the Executive of the Union, or'the
Mipifter of France, have announced the fadfc)
that a Decree of the 23d May has annulled the
Decree of the .9th, so Jar as it contravenes the
treaty with the United Slates. However, on the
bare supposition that this may be the cafe, a pa
ragraphift in Mr. Dunlap's paper of Monday,
puffs off the trar.failion as an in (lance of the
** generofit)" of Franc?, and as.facriftcing the. in
tcreft of tl>at republic for their American bre
threnâThese arc mere flourifhesâfor if to be
jujl in the fulfilment of treaties, is to be generous,
what becomes of i be.faith of nations, and that
fupericrrity of republican h.oni&f, over
that of monarchical ?âThe truth is, that those
who have made the greatefl clamour about the
facrednefs of the obligations Amcrjca is under
to fulfil its treaties with France, are the fnft to
annihilate those obligations, Dy extolling an ad
of juflic,c, if it has really taken place, as an ast ol
genervfity. By this we may fee what ideas fume

A writer in ihe Newark Gazette /peaking oj certain

" Much of this abuse springs from that old

the proceedings of the National Convention
of the second of Juneâ by which it appears
that the Convention had been surrounded for
four days by a great multitude of the citi

tilleryâthat after a tumultuous and clamor
ous debateâCouthon, one of the members, said
that all the members of the aflembly fhouM
poflsfs a confidence that they are free ; you
have found on all fides, and at every Itep a
people who are good, but irritated and desi

EXTRACT.
No achievement, since the discovery of
the western world, has, in point of moral uti
lity, as yet, rivalled the magnitude of.*lie po
litical discovery recently atchieved on that
theatre of grandeur. That the new world,
in which the majestic energy of nature has
sported iii wild luxuriance, and which is so
diftingui/hed by the bold d'fplay of physical
magnificence, should so potently arrest the
moral eye, and be also thus eminently diftin*
gui/hed by the display of human magnanimity,
is a confederation, which, if pursued in a cer
tain direction, might be expected to lead into
a rich field of interesting ideas.
