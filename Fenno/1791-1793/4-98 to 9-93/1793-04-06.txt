NATIONAL CONVENTION
Thursday, January 17
TH E Appeal Nominal on the
question, -what pun'tjbment Jhall
te infiidtd- an Louis Capet ? continu
ed through the whole of jefterday
and the preceding night,each mem
ber assigning reasons for his opini
on. The following are the most
remarkable.
Deftigoyte â" I will not enter in
to any composition with tyrants.
I vote'for death and speedy execu
tion of the sentence."
Garran de Conlon â" I am of opi
nion we cannot exercise, at the fame
time the funflions of Accufers,Judg
es, and Jury- The people did not
delegate to us the right of pro
nouncing without their ratification.
I consider that to be tyranny, when
men place thetnfelves above that e
ver fact ed law, the sovereignty of
the people. I refpetf the opinions
of those who entertain sentiments
different from mine, but I cannot a- |
dopt them.''
Chabotâ" I vote for death,' be
cause Louis has been a tyrant be
cause he is still one, and because he
may again become so."
Roberfpierreâ" Because you
have eftabliftied yonrfelves the judg
es of Louis, without the usual forms,
are you less his judges ? You can
not separate your quality of Judge
from thatof Legislator. Thei'etwo
qualities are indivisible. You have
acknowledged the crimes of the ty
rant. It is your duty so puuifli them.
No confederation should make you
hesitate refpetfting the puniftiment
refeTved for the greatest criminal
that ever existed. I vote for the
punifhmem of death."
Dannotiâ" I am not one of those
Jfotefmen who know not how to de
termine but from political princi
ples. lam a Republican, and do
not hesitate refpetfting the choice
of that punifliment reserved for
Louis the last. You ought to strike
terror into tyrants by an inflexibili
ty of character. I vote for the pu
nifliment of death "
Robert â" I vote for death ; and
if anv regret remains with me, it is,
that iny competence does not extend
to all tyrants. I would condenir
them all to death."
Barrere â" The tree of liberty
does not flouiifli, unless moistened
with the blood of Kings. I-vote
for death."
Egaliteâ" Those who have
made, or may make attempts againtt
the fovereigiity of the people de
serve deathâl vote for death."
Condorcet â" 1 declare that no
circumstance except the prefeut
could indace me to pronounce sen
tence ot death against any one. 1 re
quell, that the severest punishment,
next to death, may he inflitfed on
Louis ; but in cafe death fliall be
pronounced againrt him, I requett
that the political confederation pre
fented by Malche, viz. ' VVtihtfcflr
the punilhment ought to be accele
rated or retarded ?' ought to be
difcufled."
Lananalâ" A republican is anup
of few words. The motives Â£>f my
opinion are here. [Laying his hand
on his heart]. I vote for death."
Barbaroux â" I vote for the death
of the tyrant. In a few moments
1 {hall vote for the expulsion of his
family."'
Villette *' I vote for the con
finement of Louis as an hostage of
peace. He is overturned aniidft the
ruins of the throne, and will now
close up every avenue of it.'
Anarchariis Clootiâ"ln the name
of the Human Race, I vote for the
death of Louis.
Thomas Paineâ" I vote for the
provisional confinement of Louis,
and for his expulsion after the war.
Briftotâ" I am of opinion 'that
the only way of avoiding the dan
gers which threaten us, is to pro
nounce the punishment of death
again (I Louis, and defer its execu
tion to the moment when the people
(hall have fandlioned the constitu
tion which we shall present them.
The l'refident announced that he
was going to proclaim the result of
the Appeal Nominal. . The most
profound silence prevailed for seve
ral minutes. He saidâ
" The alTembly is composed of
74J members âone of these is dead,
6 indisposed, 2 absent without caufte, |
and censured in the minutes confor
mable to the decreeâll absent upon
comniiffions, and 4 who do not vo(e,
making in all 23 members who have
given no opinion. The number .of
votes is tkasâreduced to 72P-,

it is neceflary fiioulÂ£ be
an union of 361 fuffrages : 2i_ mem

demand of a difcuflion on the pe

The President then lowering the
tone of his voice, amidst the mod
awful silence, pronounced the sol-
lowing fentencc :
" I declare then, in the niitne ef
the Convention, that the punifh
nient which it pronoÂ«nc#Â« against
LOUIS CAPET, isâDEATH."
Saturday, January 19.
At eleven o'clock the fitting had
not opened, on account of the ab
sence of the President and two Se
cretaries. It was demanded that
they should be cenfurad ; but the
President Vergnieaux being indif
posed, and the Secretaries giving
fufficient excuse, the decree of cen
sure was repealed.
Several members spoke on the
question of a respite.
M.Buzot represented the personal
dangers which threatened those
who approved of a delay. â¢ I con
clude with giving as my opinion,
that the execution of the fenrence
of death be deferred till the expul
sion of all the Bourbons.
Thuriotâl d-envand that Â£Â«uis be
executed within 34 hours, aftd" that
the executive council be charged to
take the measures neceff'ary to en
sure the public fafety.
LegendreâThe hour of justice is
now come the head of LouJs mull
fall on the fcaffold. lam against
all respite.
After some debate, the question
was determined (imply thus : Shall
there, or (hall there nut beadelay ?
354
The nominal appeal commenced
at eight o'clock, At midnight the
Prendent announcedâ" That no
delay could take place, there being
a majority of 38 voices for the exe
cution of the sentence at the expi
ration of 24 hours."
Monday, January 21.
The fining commenced by read
ing the following letter :
" Representatives,
Â« Benoit-Louis Leduc begs the
National Contention will permit
him to give to Louis Capet thole
fnneral honors which the dignity
of the National Convention ought
to allow him. He requefls there
fore that they will order the body
of Louis Capet -to be delivered to
him, that he may carry it to Setis,
and deposit it near that of his fa-*
ther." .
After an observation made by
Chabot, that Louis ought to be bu
ried like other citizens in the usual
burying place of the Sedtion in
which he lived, the Convention
pafled to the Order of the day.
Mangeot being admitted to the
bar, informed the Convention, that
in the ci-devant PalaisÃoyal,he had
heard expressions in fa'vor of Louis,
and among others, the following :
" Louis, then, is condemned to
death, but those who have condemn
ed him, may perilh in their turn."
Mangeot added, that the expressions
he had heard seemed to agree with
the all'affination which had been
committed on the person of Pelle
tier.
Thuriot â" One of our colleagues,
whose foul was always pure, has
fallen by the hand of an aflaffin.â
| It is of the utmost importance that
the Convention (hould discover the
plot of the conspiracy ; we fliall
then fee from what quarter the
blow has proceeded. It is ho lon
ger time to diflemble. There ex
ists a conspiracy against the purell
patriots. All traitors and conspira
tors mud be seized, put in chains,
and be dragged to the fcaffold. I
move that the Executive Council be
ordered to give an account of the
circumstances which J>rf" a - J >
con.panied and followed the tranf
a<f^ion âwhether Pans, the assassin,
formerly one of the body guards
he arretted, and his papers fealea
up."
Maure â" A friend of relleiier
gave the following account of his
alTaffination. He wag dining yef
day at the Garden de I'Egalite, in a
Coffee-houfe kept by one Ferrier.
Six persons came from an adjoining
apartment, and one said, Â«â¢ There
is that scoundrel Pelletier Saint
Fargeau.' 'My name is Pelletier,'
replied the Deputy, ' but I am not
a scoundrel.' ' Did you rot vote
for the death of the King ?' 'Yes
I did, but that was a duty imposed
on ine by my conscience.' Scarcely
had he pronounced the words when
Paris thrust his sabre into the lower
part of his belly, which occasioned
a large and deep wound. Saint
Fargeau requested that no hurt
might be done to the ailaffin. He
was carried to his father's house,
and expired this morning, wilhing
that his death might be ufeful to
the Republic."
Many members complained of
having received letters threatening
their lives.
The Conveution palled a decree
to attend his funeral.
The Convention then recurring
to the various propofitinns which
had been made, decreed as follows.
I. An address to the French peo
ple refpedling the present circum
stances (hall be drawn up.
11. Every citizen (hall, in the
course of 24 hours, declare, under

THE EXECUTION.
Conformably to the arrangement
made by the executive council, Louis
was yesterday put to death at the
Place de la Revolution, heretofore
Place de Louis XV.
Twenty-five citizens of known
principles, well arrarrl. âjâ
with the manual exercise, and liav.
jng each 16 rounds of (hot, were
cho fen from relf,ion 10 fo,m a
guarn of 1200 men, who accompa
nied the unfortunale monarch 10
the place of execution.
Strong detachments from ilie dif
ferent legions were polled in tht
(treets through which the royal pri
soner was to pass, and also in all the
avenues leading to the place de la
Revolution, to prevent any confu*
fion, and each fedlion had a body in
reserve, ready to move at a moment's
warning, to maintain public order,
ftiould any attempts have been made
to disturb it.
Cannon were also distributed in
every quarter, whereic was thought
they could be any way serviceable,
had events made it neceflary to have
employed them ; for even to the
last moment the sanguinary facftion,
I who pronounced the death of the
I unfortunate monarch, manifefted
I symptoms of fear that some attempt
I might be made to rescue liim.^
Between eight and nine
I in the morning, Louis proceeded
from his apartments iii the Temple,
and got into the Mayor's ca " ia^'
I w
hÂ« accompanied him, as did alio
M. Edgworth, or de Fermori, an
Irish priest, whom he requeued
I might attend him. Louis was are â 
fed in a brown great coat, white
waistcoat, black breeches and ItocH-
I iâgsâhis hair was drefled.
The proceflion, commanded >
I Marefchal Santerre,proceeded alorg
I the Boulevards, to the place ae a
I Revolution. One hundred Oe
darmes on horseback formed an a
I vanced guard to the precefiion.
1 rear guard was composed of iop n
I tional guards from the rnilita J
school. Various reserves of cava
I lined the procession, and pat' 9
the out-lkirtsof the city. . ,
The unfortunate monarch arn
I at the foot of the fcaffold at tw
minutes pad ten. He moMiK d tW
fcaffold with firmnefs andd'gnir,.
. I appeared deftrous to addre
, people, but even this was den.ea
him. Drums and trumpets g
the signal, and at twenty-twÂ®
I nutes past ten his head wa
1the Kipghad entered itâthofehow
ever who had previously entered,
and gQt near enough to the fcaffold,
notwithstanding the indecent noise
of drums and trumpets, heard him
plainly pronounce these wordsâ
:< Citizens, I forgive tuy enemies,
and I die innocent !"
Afier his death the liearelt spec
tators divided among thein what ot
his hair had been cut off by the
ftioke of the guilotine, and several
persons were so inhuman as to dip
their handkerchiefs in his blood,
which they afterwards carried a
bout,Tcryingâ" Behold the blood
of a tyrant 1" _ ,
Louis, 011 mounting the Icattold,
jnrtantly took off his ttock himfelf,
as well as his great coat, and un- I
fall en ed* his shirt collar. His hair
had been clubbed up close like an
Abbess, that no indignity might be
offered him, or that it should occa
sion no delay by hanging
The executioner went np to tie his
arms, which the King recoiled at ;
but ic was soon done-âThe execu
tioner then took up a large pair of
fciU'ars to cut off his hair. The
King appeared mortified at what
was doing, and said, " I have put
all right" âthe executioner, how
ever, cut the hair off.
When the executioner fiiewed his
head to the people, cries of Vive la
Nation â > five la Republic J were
heard on all fides, & several groups
made ute of the following exprel
fionsâ" VVe always wished Well to
him, but he never wished well to
ns!" Many, however, shewed e
-111 ot ions of a different natute, but
which they were obliged to conceal,
as much as possible, for their own
personal fafety.
His body was transported to the
parish church of La Magdelane,
where it was interred (without any
insult being offered to it) between
the persons who loft their lives dn
the illuminations on account
of his and the Swiss who
fell on the 10th of August.
Louis, before his departure from
the Temple, delivered to the Com
missioners of the Council General,
who were upon the gWHvJj ins ihi
ter wj]I f twn copics of which he
had written on the 2S'h of Decem
ber laflâa copy of which I hope to
feÂ»d you-to-morrow. â¢
Three thonfand livres (1201. ster
ling) were found in his apartments
at the Temple, which were sent to
the Council General of the Com
mons.
The city remained quiet, in gloo
my silence, through the whole of
the dstf. In the morning the shops
were (hut, and no woman was al
lowed to be in the streets till the
procession returned with the body
of Louis.

at all times dangerous to the general inter

which lead to the violation of the most sacred
duties, and are utterly subversive ol the peace

At Tunbridge Wells, on Friday,
it was thought right to tie a figure,
reprefeming the Writer of the
Rights of Man, to a cart's tail, and
flog hini through the town. In or
der to give the whipping fcerie a
better effetf, a man was concealed
in the cart, who bellowed out lofti

ed the characfieriftic obstinacy of
Paine ; for no f'mart, nor even the
promise of mercy, could extort from
him that ejaculation commonly used
by criminals under flagellation,
namely, " God save the King !"
The figure was afterwards burnt,
with the ceremony that has been
observed in other places.

At a meeting of the School Committee,
February 51b, 1793.
The Committee, appointed to examine " The
Preceptor's Afliftant, or Student's Guide," being
a systematical treatise of Arithmetic, by John
Vi.NyvL l, teacher of the Mathematics Sc Writ
ing, in Borton r reported, that they have attended
that service, and are of opinion, that the work
is executed with judgment, and is as well calcu
lated for the use of schools, counting houses, and
private families, as any of the fame compass
that has hitherto been offered to the public.
Voted, That the above report be accepted,
and that Mr. Vinall befurnifhed with a copy
of it, whenever he shall desire it.

CHARLES BULFINCH, Sec'ry.
The following character of the above work,
is given in the Review of the MaJJaekufctts Ma
gazine, fpr Jan. 1793 :
" This is a very ufcful work, and is no ill
proof of thejodgment and industry of the author.
The rules are laid down with propriety, and
the examples annexed are fuffitient tor their il
lustration. One part of the work deserves par
ticular commendation. We mean that which
the author ftilea " Mercantile Arithmetic." It
occupies a considerable portion of his book, hut
not more than its importance will juftify. We
would recommend to the young Arithmetician
to pay a particular attention to this branch.
He will find its principles well explained And
(hould he make himfelf matter of them, he will
always have reason to acknowledge his obliga
tion to the judicious and laborious author. We
cannot but congratulate the rising generation on
account of the many ufeful produttions which
have lately appeared; and in which their im
provement has been principally consulted.â
Among those productions we must place this
treatise of Arithmetic. We (hould be wanting
in justice to the author, (hould we not acknow
ledge that his work is in reality that which its
title importsâThe Preceptor's Assist ant,
or Student's Guide."

THE Author is sensible that the fiift edition
of his American Geography (which makes Part
I. of the above work) was in many instances de
fettive, in others erroneous, and in (omeoffen
five. It has been his endeavour, as it was his
desire, in the present edition, to fupplv the defi
ciencies, correct the errors, and meliorate the
offenfive parts of the last. To aflift him in 'this
business, he has received many valuable commu
nications from the heads of departments in the
general government, and from gentlemen of re
fpettability in the several Hates. The descrip
tion of foreign countries (which composes Part
11. of the above work) has been carefully com
piled from the moll approved writers 011 Geo
graphy, and ufeful information introduced irom
the discoveries of the latest Navigators, Travel

nor expense have been spared to render this' Work
the most complete, accurate, and ufeful of any
ever offered to the public.
