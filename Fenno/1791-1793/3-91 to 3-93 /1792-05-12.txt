REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION
[concluded.]
rprt*; countrie; fouthof Pennsylvania are remarkably rich
1 in foflils. Coals, copper, iron, lead, and other mineral?
are found in either Virginia, North or South-Carolina or
Georgia, or all of them. Mineral appearances occur every
where. The promotion of manufactures is neceflarv to draw
these forth ; and as they have immense fore ft s of wood and
the molt powerful mill-dreams, there can be no doubt, 'that
they will be brought into use, as soon as those means fli'all be
adopted.
The family manufactures of the middle and interior coun
ties of Virginia, North-Caroli-ia, and the interior counties of
Georgia, South-Carolina, and Maryland, are said to be greater
in value, than the articles of foreign manufactures, which
they use; and were they universally awake to the facilitv
profits, and national importance of this mode of manufactur
ing, they might extend it much further, without impeding
their firming operations, while, at the fame time, they would
provide an use for their agricultural productions.
A fmgle (late, Pennsylvania, has upwards of fifty paper
mills, which work up materials of no value. The manufac
tures from those mills are computed at two hundred and fifty
thousand doUarsâthe hands employed in them do not exceed
one hundred and fifty, or two hundred. That ltate contaius
about one ninth of the people of the United States, and their
contributions to the expenses of the government and the i'n
tereil of the public debt, are confcquentlv about 400,000 dol
lars. Their paper-mills, therefore, indemnify them for five
eighths of their quota ! It is the duty of government to en
courage the otherftates to do the fame, especially as it can be
done by water means, and not by men diverted from their
farms. The southern states do not want a capacity for this
manufacture, which has acquired an eftabliflunent in Mary-
J and, and has appeared as far to the southward as North-Ca
rolina.
It may be fafcly affirmed, that the manufactures of leather
in the United States exceed in value all our annual bur
dens. We import few or no Ihoes. In each of the two last
years we have procured from abroad no more than 70,000
pair of .hoes and boots, for 4,100,000 of peop!e. If we use
only one pair and a half per annum per person, at fevcntv-five
cent,, they will amount to 4,500,000 dollars, which exceeds
e very demand of the general and state governments. The
hides, flans, bark, lime, thread, bridles, and wax, nav, the
the very heel-pegs, are all drawn from our lands and farms.
Recollecting this, aud similar facts, we cannot question the
utility of mamifaftures to the farmers, planters, and landed
interest If the manufacture of (hoes in this countrv, were
abolilhed, our annual debt to foreign countries would be in
creased to an amount equal to all our public contributions.
Similar observations might be made on several other articles
though no one to so great an extent.
The manufactures of wool in Oreat-Britain have been ftat
edby tneirminifters at 16,800,0001. sterlingâand the simple
manufactures of liquors in that country are said to consume
twenty-five millions of bulhels of grain. Were there no other
proof,-, we could not doubt the importance of manufactures
to tbe agriculture- of that country. They nourilh and support
it. We make up all our woo!âour lands produce cotton with
great facility ; and we manufacture liquors as easily as Bri
tam. There is no doubt, that the latter branch already af
fords to our farmers an annual market for 1,500,000 bu(hels
of gram. This is well underltood and carried on
in all the southern states.
i he objection, that manufactures take the people from a
gnculture, is notfolid, aselfewhere observed ; since women,
children, horses, water, and fire, all work at manufacturer,
and perform four-fifths of the labour ; and as many manufac
turers migrate to the United States, it mav be fairly nueftion
ed, whether the (Quantity of agricultural induftrv is not in
creased by the impulse and demand arising from manufactures,
though a few cultivators fliould follow them. And it mav be
alked, whether a fanner does not raise the More cotton, flax
hemp, and wool, because his wife and daughters spin and
Weave them ?
The employment of the new medium, the public certificates
(which may be taken at 1 j,000,0001. fterlin ? J in a country that
formerly had not 3,000,0001. sterling of medium, renders ma
nufactures necefiary at this time. It may be said, lands will
employ it. But farms fold well at the time when 3,000,0001.
sterling was probably the utmofl: extent of our medium, and
cannot therefore give employment to the additional twelve
millions, though they might to a part of it. The firft applica
tion of this capital is intended to be made to the ftianufaffu -
ing of cotton, which is peculiar to the southern states. This
15 one method by which those states will be benefited by even
that part of the public debt, which they do not own. On this
important point more will be said hereafter.
More money is employed in manufafl-ures, than in foreign
commerce, because the gross value of exported article l : is
much lei"", than the gross value of manufactured articles. This
will not be doubted, when itfis remembered, that Ihoes alone
amount to several millions of dollars. These manufacturer
rinnot be deemed less important to the southern landholders
than foreign commerce ; and those proprietors will not be dif
pofcd to neglect foreign commerce, nor will they consider it
Hi lriCiative to their local interests.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MANUFACTURES
TT is often saul in conversation, that agriculture
A is the greatest inieielt of the American -peo
ple, and the foundation on which their wealth
and prosperity art fitpported. Thisisjuft, but
3 conclusion is drawn from the principle which
is not equally well founded. We often hear it
i emarked that agriculture being the belt interest,
it is improper to engage in manufactures. This
is carelessly aliened and admitted. But, is it
n tie that the interest of agriculture is injured by
our manufactures?â Our farmers will not easily
e pei fuaded that it is. What is done with (he
wool, flax, cotton, hemp, but to work them up.
All the iron made in the country is wrought in
ir. Would any man, in his wits, recommend
'hat all thele articles, which form the materials
of our in oft valuable manufactures, should no
longer be culiivated or attended to. The far
[ iner would fuffer, and the money of the country
nuift be lent out of it to buy the articles. What
has the farmer to apprehend from the increase
of manufactures ; that he will fell flax, hemp,
cotton and wool, on better terms, and in greater
quantities? The manufactures of the country
have grown up wonderfully since the protetftion
given them by the laws of the United States.
Since that increase, have not the farmers found
the advantage ? 1 hey haveâand the new impolt
a<Jt will operate to extend the demand for the
pi oduce of i heir lands. The fail-cloth manufac
toi ies at Boston, and elfevvhere in the state of
Maflachufetts, have made a demand for all the
flax produced and offered at market, and the
price has risen with the demand. The farmers
in that instance receive a direct profit from the
manufactory. This is intended only as an in
stance-âmany others might be adduced. They
all tend to refute the insinuations which are often '
made to rouse jealouly, on the thread-bare pre
sence that the eastern and southern states have
different interests, and that the farmers will be
facrificed to the manufacturers.
I he manufactures of the southern states ap.
pear, on enquiry, to be more advanced, as well
as moi e prosperous, than has been believed. But
if it was not I'o, it is hard to fee the damage sus
tained by the louthern states, by the middle and
eastern manufacturers buying their flax, wool,
cotton, hemp and coals, as well as their corn, to
feed themâall which is actually the cafe at pre
sent.
It is much to be wished that a brotherly affec
tion may subsist between tlie citizens of the dif
ferent states. If these remarks, trite as they
may appear, have any tendency to that end, the
delign of the writer will be accomplished.

EXTRACTS.
" When fortune frowns, and friendfhip stands aloofâwhen
the forlorn viaim lies stretched on the bed of auguifh with
miferv and want pictured before himâthe pleafmg the'vene
rable form of religion presents herfelf to his viewâfpeaki
joy and consolation to her humble votaryâ(hews him thede
lufions of riches, and the vanities of worldly plealure. Hij
groans are changed into triumphsâas his misfortunes accu
mulate, his hopes increaseâand the pillar of his fortitude is
the wretchedness of his conditionâwith the fapeof antiquity
he may fay, "Alas! he fliould ljave perilhec', had he notbeen
undone."
" Pure and genuine religion does not consist in the difguft
mg feveritv of a puritanical outside ; nor does it in the lead
depend on nominal diftinftions, as was formerly imagined !
wlreu the difference of a single letter, in a term of favored or
thodoxy, opened wide the field of controversy where the be
nevolent spirit of christianity was facrificedto theological ran
cour, the church torn into schisms, and her wreatfi of victory
was t.\e blood of her children. As well might the intrinsic
worth and excellence of a jewel be ertimated from the caflcet
in which it happens to be inclosed, as the goodness of religion
measured by external forms, or inferred from modes of faith.
It is built on the love and reverence of the Supreme Being
and an unfliaken belief in the words of sacred truth, joined to
a warm and practical benevolence towards all our fellow be
ings--?iety and virtue are its everlaftmg pillars, faith and
charity being the chief corner Hone."CONGRESS.

Ttu-contiaft for the supplies of the army on the rout from
fort Put, was made by Theodofiin Fowler, with the .Secretary of
the Treafui y, and bears date the twenty-eighth day of Ottober,
one thousand seven hundred and ninety, that at the fame time a
bond in the penalty of one hundred tnoufjnd dollars, with Walter
Livirigllon and John Cochran, lecuritits thereto, was entered into
ior the due execution of the contrail.
That oil the third day of January, one thousand seven hundred
and ninety-one, the conuaft was wholly transferred from the said
Fowler to Wiiliam Duer, a copy of which transler was lodged
in the office of the Secretaiy of the Treasury; that by letter from
the Secietary ar War, beaiing date the twenty-fifth of February,
one thousand seven bundled jiid ninety-one, addretled to William
Duel, it appears that he was conlidered as the contra&or; that no
corieipondcnce appeals to have taken place fubfcquently to that
tn-.e between Theodoiius Fowler and either the treasury or wai
depaitmcnts âthat 011 the sixth day of March, one thouland seven
hundred and ninety-one, a contrail was entered into by William
Duer with the Secretary at War, tor supplying the troops with
provisions until their airtval at Fort Pitt, and at Fort Pitt, a bond
was at the fame time entered into by the said William Duer for
the due execution of the said conuaft in the penalty of four thou
sand dolltrs, without any fecuiity whatloever.
That the ast making provision for the defence of the frontiers,
received the signature of the Prefideiu of the Un ted Slates the
t'niid of Maich, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-oneâ
That General St. Clair was appointed commander in chief of ihe
army deflincd for the expedition on the tourih day ot the fame
month, and on the twenty-eighth left Philadelphia for Foit Pitt,
at which place he arrived the fixtecr.th day of April, and from
thence proceeded to Lexington, and from thence to Fort Wafli
-.ngton, w here he ariived on the fifteenth day of May-Atthe time
of the airival of the General at Fort Washington, the garrison
there confided of levcnty-five non-commissioned officers and pri
vates fit for dutyâthe garrison at Fort Harmar of forty-fiveâat
Fort Steuben of sixty-oneâat Fort Knox of eighty-threeâand on
the fifteenth day ot July, the whole of the firll United States regi
ment, amounting to two hundred and ninety-nine non-commis
sioned olÃceis and privates, arrived at Fort Washington under or
ders from the commander in chief. Gensral Butler was appoint
ed the fccond in command in the month ot March, and immedi
ately proceeded to make the uecelTary arrangements for the re
eruitiii" service ; that he arrived in Baltimore in the slate of Ma
iylandÂ°the twentieth of April, and continued there till the thir
tieth of the fame month ; that he ariived at Carlifli in the slate of
Pennsylvania 011 the ninih of May, and at Fort Put on the twenty
second of the month. It appears that 110 monies tor purchaling
fupphes were furnlfhed at Carlisle, which was the place of ren
dezvous, for the entitled foldierv, on the ninth of May ; and that
Mr. Smith, agent for the contiaaor, was aduely engaged 111 fur
mfhing fuppiies for the troops on credit.
It appeais by letters from John Kean, another of the contrac
tor's agents, that no monies had been received by him on the
eighth of May ; and it appears that on the twenty-third of March,
there was advanced to William Duer, upon the last mentioned
contrail, fiotn the treasury, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars;
that there was advanced upon the firft mentioned contrail, the
sum of seventy thousand dollais, id the following to wit :
March *2d 10,000 Dollars.

It appears (rom the correspondence of Geneial Butler to the
Secretary at War, from the ninth ot May to the ninth of June, re
peated complaints were made of fatal mismanagements and neg
kÂ£ts, in the quarter matter's and military stores department, par
ticularly as to tents, knap-sacks, camp kettles, cartridge boxes,
pack laddies, See. all of which articles were deficient in quantity,
and bad in quality.
The pack fadcles in particular were made in Philadelphia,
which with the transportation, amounted to more than double
the price at which they might have been procured at Fort Pitt,
and were found upcu examination to be unfit for use ; âtne arms
sent forward aDpear not to have been duly examined, and arrived
at Fort Pitt extremely out of order, and many totally unfit lor
use, which circumstance rendered repairs absolutely necelTary, and
added to the delay of the troops at Fort Put.
It appears that a great proportion of the powder supplied for
the use of the army, was not of good quality, though an experi
ment was made by Major Fcrgufon at Fort Put with a howitz,
who reported in favor of the quality of the powder. On the
ninth of June General Neville,another of the contra&or's agents,
informed General Butler, that he had not at that time received
iuy monies from the contractors, for the puTchafe of provtfions,
&c. for the troops, and was obliged to supply them oa credit;
that the country furnilhed provisions in abundance at a cheap rate,
when money was had for the purchase. That (hortly alter this
information was communicated to General Butler, at his requctt
four hirndrcd dollars were advanced to General Neville by the
quarter matter, for the purchase of provisions for the troops. The
troops arrived at Fort Pitt in the following order, to wit:
May 16th, Captain Slough, sixty-nine men.
May iÃ:h, Captain Powers, seventy-eight men.
May 19th, Captain Ciibbs, forty men : fame day, Captain
Guthrie, twenty-three.
May 25th, Captain Armstrong, seventy-six : fame day, Captain
Kirkwood, sixty-seven.
May 13th, Captain Snowden, one hundred and one.
June 2d, Captain Sparks, eighty-three.
June 3d, Captain Butler, fixtv-one : fame day, Captain Brook,
eighty-two, : fame day, Captain Vanfwearingen, eighty-eight.
June sth, Captain Pike, feventy-three;âTotal, including offi
cers and privates,eight hundred and forty-two; and left that plaee
in the following orderâMajor Fergufon with Capi. Armstrong's
company, about the firft of June. Captain Snowden, with the
troops under his command, on the day of Major Gaither,
â¢with about {?ve hundred men, 12th day of Jnly ; and on the 22d
August the last of the troopsunder the command of Capt. Phelon,
and General Builer with the Quartermaster-General, ou the 26th
August.
It appears that General Butler had orders from the department
at war to protest the frontiers with the troops under his com
mand, and that the delays in fending forward the troops from
Fort Pitt arose partly from that circumOance, and partly from the
temporary want of supplies of provilions and other neceflarits,
and from the want of the necefTary boats for their tranfportaiion,
which were not in readiness as soon as the troops were. It ap
pears that General Butler adlcd with ability, aftivuv and zeal in
bis command at Fort Pitt, and thai the delays of the troops
cannot be imp" l "* to his want of judgement,- or l\Â»s i*ant "t
exertion.
The troops met with confiderablc difficulties and delays in go
ingdpwM the river, from the low state of the water,-and arrived
at Fort Washington in the following orderâ Capt. Muir.lorc;
from North-Carolina, with about fifty men, on the d3y of
Ma;.r Fcrgufon with Capj. Armstrong's company, on the
day of Major Gaither, with the iroops under his command,
on the day of Col. Datke, with the troops under hi com
mand, on the day of and the Kentucky inilitia on the
day'of
The army confiding of about two thousand non-commiM ruled
officers and privates, moved from Fort Washington lÂ«y orders
from the commander in chief to a place about five or lix miles
from thence, called Ludlow's ft nion, where they continued till
the seventeenth day of September, at which time the whole army
amounted to about two thousand three hundred non-comrnifiion
ed officers and privates fit for dutvâl hat the price of iation< at
Fort Washington agreeably to contrail was 6 3-4 9 0l hs of a dol
lar per ration, the price of rations at Ludlow'* station was 15 1-4
901 hs of a dollar per ration.
That tbe inducement? ofâthe commander in chief to th-.s move
ment, appear to have been to furnifh green forage for the horses
and beef cattle of the ai my, to inftruft the soldiery infield cxer
cife ami other neceflary difcipltne, -and to .deprive them of the
mean* of intoxication which were very plentifully supplied at
Fort Washington, and used to an cxccfiive debtee by the soldiery,
to correct the eXceflive use of which the nioft rigid attention to
discipline was found incompetent.
Mr. Hodgdon was appointed quarter mafler general in the
month of March, and continued at Philadelphia, until the 4th of
June, he then proceeded to Fort Pitt, where he arrived the r .enth
of the fame monthâno fufficient causes have appeared to the
committee to juftify this delay, and h'S presence with the army
appears to have been efientialiy necellary previously to that time,
the duties of the commander in chief were much increased in
confequcrjce of the absence of the quarter mafler general and after
a continued expettationof his arrival at Fort Washington, for
more than fix weeks, the commander in chief gave him express
orders by letter to repair to camp without delay.
The receipt of the letter is acknowledged, but the orders con
tained therein were neither answered nor obeyed, and his arrival
at camp was not until the tenth of September. The commander
in chief until that time in addition to the duties of his office, dif
charaed those of the quarter master general, and the military stores
furnifhed bv that department were so deficient from misman
agement and ncgleti, that many things essential to the movements
of the army were either wholly made or repaired at Fort Walh
ington, and even the tools for the artificers to work with; the
quarter-maftcr particularly informed the commander in chief that
two complete travelling forges were sent forward, and upon ex
amination both of them were found to be without anvils, many
other things equally necefTary were either wholly omitted, or un
fit for their intended use. There were fix hundred and feventy
five ftatid of arms at Fort Washington the firftof June, and most
of them totally out of repair. The commander in chief appears
to have been correct and attentive in all his communications with
the Secretary at war, and to have discharged the various duties
which devolved upon him with ability, a&ivity and zeal.
The army moved from Ludlow's Nation on the seventeenth day
of September, and arrived at the place where Fort Hamilton is
now ere&ed, on the day of they employed a
bout fifteen daysbuiMing'that fort, and then proceeded in their
march to the place where Fort Jefferfonis now erected, forty-four
miles distant from Fort Hamilton, where they arrived on the
day of O&ober, and commenced their inarch from ihat place on
the 24th of the fame mon hâthat the army at this time confided
of about non-commissioned officers and privates sic tor du
ty ; at this time the army had not more than three days supply of
flour, and were sometimes at one fourth, and fomctimes at one
hall allowance of that article, the deficiences of which allowance
were made up by in crrafingthe quantity ot beef with which they
were plentifully supplied. The army was delayed five or fix
days on the march from Fort JcfFerfon,for the want of provisions,
and the season was so far advanced that fufficient green forage for
the horses could not be procured, from which circumstances ma
ny of the horses were totally loft, and others rendered uofu for
service.â
The orders to the commander in chief to proceed with the ex
pedition, wereexprels and unequivocal, so much so, as in the
opinion of the commiitee to preclude the commander in chief
from cxercifing any discretion relatively to that object.
On the 31ft of O&ober about sixty of the Kentucky militia
deserted in a body, and the firft regiment consisting of about three
hundred effettive men was detached with a view to cover a con
voy of provisions which was expe&ed and which it was supposed
was in danger from the deserted militia, and to prevent further
desertionâOn the 3d of Novemberâafter detaching the firft re
giment the army consisted of about fourteen hundred effeflive
men, and on the morning of the 4th about a half an hour after
sunrise, a general attack was commenced, and in a few minutes
thereafter, neai ly the whole army was surrounded by the enemy,
the aflion continued about four hours during which several char
ges were made by part of the army, which caused the enemy to
give way but produced no good effect. the attack was unexpected,
the troops having been just difmilTcd from the morning parade,
it commenced uoon the militia who were in advance of the main
army, and who fled through the main army, without firing a gun,
this circumstance threw the troops into some disorder which it
appears they never completely recovered during the action, the
fire of the army wasconftant but not well diretted,and it appears
that a part ofthe troops behaved as well as could be expeftcd from
their state of discipline, and the manner and suddenness of the at
tack ; the commander in chief appears to have been cool and de
liberate in the whole of the action, and the officers in general ac
tive and intrepidâthe whole order of march as far as the com
mute are capable of expi effing an opinion, appears to have been
judicious, and the ground for action well chosen ; the retreat was
disorderly in the extreme, after it commenced no orders were
obeyed if any were given, the men having loft all regard of dis
cipline or controul; all the precautions appear to have been taken
for the fafety and comfort of the wounded which the circumstan
ces of the cafe would admit of.
20,000
10,000
The committee have had no competent evidence before
them to ascertain the number of the enemy in actionâthere
were various conjefhires as to the number, from different
persons from five hundred the lowest, to one thonfand or
twelve hundred the highest.
Mr. Barton a witness examined by the committee con versed
with a chief at Niagara who was in the ast ion, and was by him
informed that the number of the enemy in action was one
thousand and forty and that fix hundred more had convened,
but were engaged in hunting, at the time of the action. He
was also informed that the enemy had not collected in any
considerable numbers'until a few days b.efore the action, this
information appears to be corroborated bv some other circum
stances fufficient to induce a belief of the fact in the com-
mittee.
The Contractors for supplies agreeably to the terms ofcon
traft were to furnifli horses, &c. for the transportation of the
supplies, in this condition of the contrast, there was a total
failure, which compelled the commander in chief to direst be
tween fix and seven hundred horses to be purchased by Israel
Ludlow, one of the contractor's agents, to draw bills on Mr.
Duer, the acting contractor for payment, which bills were
434
eudorfcd by the commander in chief, to the amount Gf about
fevsntcen thotfand dollars, were protested by t!ie contractor,
u id paid at the treasury ; the persons employed by the agent
of the contractors to drive the borfes, appear toiiave been to
tally unacquainted with that bufmefs, and from the want of
bells, hopple-, and other nece(Taries of that kind, as well at
froii other gross mismanagement, many of the horses were
loft, and others rendered unfit for service ; âfrom which cau -
e> there were no 4 : pack horses fuificient to transport thenecei
fary quantity of flour from Fort-Washington for the use "of
the army 011 their march, this circuinftauce retarded the exe
cution of the expedition.
The officers agreeaK'v to t'le term? of contract had an elec
tion, of drawing the whole of the rations, to which their rank
cntit'ed them, or of receiving the contract price of them iÂ«
cafli, the contractor's agents not being furnifhed with money
for this purpose, gave rife to a general order, by which the of
ficer was directed to receive a certificate flora the contrac
tor's agent called a due bill, of one of which bill? the following
is a copy " Dae Major H. Gaither one hundred and feveu
t/-three complete rations on the route to Miami village as ap
pears by Wilson's certificate." MATT. EARNEST,
for V.M. D'JER.
Fort-Walhington, Nov. 27th, 1790.
This due bill ituied upon the officer's signing some acknow
ledgement of fatisfaftion for his whole retained rations,which
acknowledgment of fatisfaftion forms a voucher for fettle
men tto the contractor, with the treasury department; and
the officer is refufed payment for these due bills at the pay of
fice. All casualties by which these evidences of debt become
loft or destroyed, are the gain of the contractor and the loss oi*
the officer.
It is suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury, though not
with positive certainty, that a fufficient sum will be found dne
from the treasury to the contractors upon a final fettlemc-nt,
to cover all these debts to the officers; the general order
which had the operation before stated, continued in force a
bout five or fix \veeks, and was abolished about the 19th of
O&ober. The privates of the levies received but three dol
lars pay each, from the time of their refpe&ive inlifhnents to
the time of their refpe&ive discharges, and were a&ually dis
charged without further pay or settlement; notes of
were given them, fpecifying the time of their service, and
bearing indorsations, that some advancements had been made
to them in account, without stating the amount, the object of
which is suggested to have been to prevent transfers, the in
tended e*fe<st was not produced by the rneafure; the notes
were fold for trifling confide rations, the real sums due on the
notes were various, from ten to twenty-five dollars, and they
were frequently fold for one dollar, or one gallon of whiskey;
the monies for the pay of the levies did not leave Philadelphia
till the 4th ofD?cember, nor arrive at Fort-Washington till
the 3d of January, 1792, some time after the last inlifted le
vies were known to be entitled to their discharges â¢* two rea
sons have been afligned by the Secretary at War for this de
lay of payment, the one, because there was no regular Pay
master to the army, and the difficulties of transmitting mo
nies at so great a distance to the army, in consequence of the
want of such an officer ; the other, because it was supposed the
army would be at that time at the Miami village, so far ad
vanced in the wilderness, as not to admit of the practicability
of discharging the levies, the total defeat of the not hav
ing been previously counted upon.
The cloathing for the levies appears to have been of a very
inferior quality, particularly coats, hats, and lhoes, the last
of which in many cases lasted not more than four days, and
better cloathing was furniflied them upon their inliftments in
to the regular service, which was for a tune countenanced by
the commander in chief.
Various modes appear to have been pursued by the officer:
in inlifting the levies, which occasioned great uneasiness and
some confuHon ; a considerable part of the Virginia battalion
was so inlifted, that the terms of their inliftments appear to
have expired the ift of November : the orders to the recruit
ing ferjeants appear not to have been fufficiently explicit up
on this pointâ vhether the terms of inliftment were to com
mence at the time of inliftment, or at thÂ£ arrival at a place of
rendezvous. The militia appear to have been composed prir.-
ciDally offubftitutes, and totally ungovernable, and regardless
of military duty or subordination. It appears that the com
mander in chief had it in contemplation to commence the ex
pedition at least one month earlier than it was commenced,
with the force he then had, which was not very different from
the real force in a^ion; but was prevented for the want of
the quarter-matter and contractor, and in consequence of the
extreme deficiencies and derangements of the buiinefs ot tho-e
departments, the person sent forward by the quarter-matter
being totally incompetent for the business, and the contrac
tor's agents not being fufficiently supplied with money to en
able them to execute their duties.
It appears to the committee, that in the wilderness "where
vegetables are not to be had, and the duties ofthe soldier un
commonly hard, the rations allowed by law, if completely sup
plied, are infufficient. This circumstance, with others, pro
duced discontent and desertion among the soldiers.
It appears to the committee that there were appropriate
for the use of the war department, for the year one
seven hundred and ninety-one, the sum of fix hundred an
ty-two thousand seven hundred and sixty-one dollars, and ix
ty-one cents, and that there have been advanced b> t.ie tre

156,595 s<>From ths foregoing Hate of fails, the committee
fugged the following as the principal causes,
in their opinion, of the failure of the late ex
pedition, under Major General St. Clair.
THE delay in furnilhing the materials and
estimates for, and in passing the ad: for the pro
tetftion of the frontiers, the time after the pari
jng Â«f which was hardly fufficienc to "complete
and discipline an army for such an expedition,
during the summer months of the fame year.
The delays consequent upon the gross and va
rious mismanagements and neglecls in the quar
ter-master's and contractor's departments ; the
lateness of the season at which the expedition
was undertaken, the green forage having been
previously deitroyed by the fro 11, so that a I'uffi
ciency of subsistence for the horses neceflary for
the annv could not be procured.
The want of discipline and experience in the
rroops.
The committee conceive it but justice to the
Commander in Chief to fay, that in their opinion,
the failure of the late expedition can in no re
fpetft be imputed to his conduct, either at any
time before or during the action ; but that as his
conduct in all the prepatarory arrangements was
marked with peculiar ability and zeal, so his con
duct during the action furnilhed llrong leltimo
nies of his coolnefsand intrepidity.
The committee tuggelt as reasons for leaving
the number of the troops at particular periods,
and the dates of some facts blank, the want of
fufficienc time to complete the report with mi
nuteness, and in some instances, the want of the
neceflary evidence.
The said report being read,
Refolvtd, That this House will early in the
next session proceed to take the fame into consi
deration.
Extract from the Journal,
JOHN BECKLEY, Clerk
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY EVENING, May 8
A meflage from the President of the United
States, by Mr. Lear, informed the House that he
had this day approved and signed two aifts, which
originated in the House, viz. An aifl supplemen
tary to the adi making provision for the debt of
the United States ; and an atft making compen
sations to the couimiffianers of loans for extraor
dinary expences.
A mefTage from the Senate, by Mr. Otis, in
formed the Hoijfe, that they have pasTed an act
refpetfiing the government of the territory of the
United States north-weft and south of the river
Ohio.
The committee on enrolled bills reported as
truly enrolled the following bills : An acft mak
ing certain appropriations therein fpecifiedâAn
aift refpec s ting the government of the territory of
the United States north-weft and south of the ri
ver OhioâAn ast refpediing the claim of J. B.
CuttingâAlso, a resolve directing pointed clear
ances of particular form for the collectors of the
United States.
The Speaker ligned the above bills and resolve :
the fame being laid before the Prelident, a mes
sage was received by Mr. Secretary Lear, inform
ing the House that they had received his appro
bation and signature.
A meflage from the Senate, by Mr. Secretary
Otis, informed the House, that the Prelident had
notified the Senate that he had approved and
signed two atfts which originated in the Senateâ
An atfi to provide for a copper coinageâand An

George Gibfon.
The Secretary also informed the House, that

next, according to law.
PARIS,
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
FEERUARY 26.
Marflial Luckner was introduced amid the ap
plauses of the Aflembly, and presented an Address
which the Minister at War read for him.
" The King having called me to Paris, I ea
gerly avail myfelf of my Itay there to renew my
profeffions of respect and gratitude to the Na
tional Aflembly : You have concurred by a de
cree in the honourable mark of esteem and con
fidence, which the King has been pleased to grant
me. My life is the property of the country that
lias adopted me; and I (hall acknowledge no
glory but what I may acquire by artociating my
felf in the triumph of the French, if their laws
and iheir liberty are threatened. Toconfecrate
â without refervc the remainder of a laborious life
to so grand and so juil a cause, will be the best
proof of my profound gratitude to the National
AlieuibJy and the King.
" In concert with the general officers of the
garrison of Stralburgh, 1 have written to the Mi
tt liter at War, to inform him of the situation of
the officers of my army, who have nothing to
lubfilt upon bin 1 heir pay. No complaint from
them has reached hiy ear j but their refignaiion
when they find rhemfelves in real diflrefs. makes
it more peculiarly the duty of their General to
make known their situation to the National As
lembly. They have not the half of their pay at
their own disposal ; and the officers of the ca
valry, on whom there are stoppages for the pur
chase of their horses, have considerably less.
" I may be allowed to flatter myfelf, that to
lay before the Representatives of the French peo
ple, the embarraflment of a part of their defen
ders, will be fuflicient to procure the redress to
be expected from their attention and theirjuftice.
" 1 shall communicate to theMiniffer at War*
111 writing, the measures which 1 think neceflary
to allure the success of the French armies. Per
mit me only to bear testimony to the National
Aflembly of the good order that reigns among
the troops under my command. The soldiers
display their patriotism by their spirit and their
Itricffc attention to discipline."
file President returned an answer to this ad
dreis, and the Aflembly ordered it to beinferted
in their minutes.
LONDON, February 28
We have heard of " proud days for England !
But what a truly proud day was Monday last for
Mr. Pitt ! âA flourifhing Exchequer, an army
and navy establishment to be reduced, and alarge
annua] (um to be reserved for payingoff the Na
tional Debt,and the public to be eased of aoo,oool.
annually in taxes !
The enemies of the Minister affetft to fay, that
he takes off taxes merely to increase his popula
rity* That popularity should be the consequence
of his having aJted so admirably for the public
interelt, is only ascribing to the people of this
country a very moderate ihare indeed of pene
tration, honesty, and common ienfe.
France, the great centre to which every po
litical eye is still turned, continues to be agitated
by all the turbulence and flu&uation incident to
democratical government. The National Allem
bly sometimes bully the Emperor, and at others
affect circumfpecftion and caution ; yet the ge
neral temper of the nation, inquietand dilturb
ed, tends to a&ion. But if they should in real
ity make war on Germany, from whence are
they to draw their supplies ? If the present re
venue of France falls fhori of the expenditure in
times of peace, how inadequate mult it be to the
public exigencies in time of war ? This reason
ing appears plausible : and yet, if a waragainfh
the German Princes confederated against France
and Liberty should take place, it might be found
to be fallacious. There is at present a general
reluctance throughout the provinces to pay the
taxes. Taxes are voted by the Afl'embly, but
evaded by the people. They do not fee the con-
nexion between taxes and liberty so readily as
the connection between taxes and war. Taxes
are as necessary to liberty as they are to war ;
for there can be no secure and permanent liber
ty without a fixed and regular government, nor
atiy fixed and regular government without a re
venue to support it. But the nation at large do
not discern this truth. They rather fancy that
there is a natural affinity between freedom and
exemption from all taxation. Though, there
fore, the French are not a fordid or avaricious,
but an open and a generous people, and though
their vows in favor of liberty are sincere and ar
dent, yet they do not exert the nerve of wealth
[Facultats] so much as they would do in the cafe
ot a war with Despotism, where they would rea
dily perceive money to be neceflary. Nor, were
their resources in money deficient, would the
daring Genius of Liberty fink down in despon
dent inaction. The Americans had little, and
next to no money ; yet their councils held al
ways a sublime course, and aspired to the lofti
eft object of ambitionâthe eltablifhment of li
berty, by equal reptefentation, for the good of
mankind. If they wanted silver and gold, they
contributed their personal service ; they gave
such things as they had ; horses, waggons, pro
visions and otherammunition. The naked Ame
rican, inspired by the unconquerable spirit of
liberty, found means to elude the grasp of the
proud and powerful Briton, covered with a coat
of mail, and glorying in his llrength.

The fiibfiance of t he lafl accounts f rom France,
received by the Louifn, Capr. Birkhead, is, that
ailignais were at 40 percent, discount in exchange
'01 f" rench crownsâThat disturbances had taken
place in Marseilles : the Spanish arms were taken
t ' ,e door of the Coni'ul of that kiugdom
that the Conlul had in consequence taken his de
parture that the national troops had difarined
the Swiss regiment of Herneitâthat this regi
ment marched to Roquivaire, Where they were
received as if they had attempted to deltroy the
liation, palled the night in the open air, and were
icarcely able to procure victuals for their money.
The only crime alledged again It them is, their
having always been subordinate to their officers,
and during iheir Hay in Marseilles, had prevent
ed the merchants from being plundered of their
property.âThat a hucktter woman having spo
ken difrefpe<stfully of the national troops who
had performed the service of disarming the Swiss,
was thrown into prisonâbut the people forced
the prison doors, took her out, and hung lier in
piefence of her hulband, at the lamp poltâthe
firft female vicftini to the revolution.âThat wheat
and flour are much wanted at Marseilles, and
that the crop now in the ground affords a very
unfavorable profpetffâThat American wheat
would fetch fifty livres per charge, and fuperfine
flour flxty livres per barrel.
i hurfday last the President of the United
States, attended by Mr. Secretary Lear, fat out
on a tour to the Southward. âWe hear that the
President will be at the Seat of Government
by the 10th June.
According to the lift in the firft page of this

Although the proposition tor afTuming the re
sidue of the State Debts was not adopted at the
late feifion, yet, as it will undoubtedly be renew
ed at the next, there is the liigheft probability
that it will then succeed. The principle on
which the former aflumption was made, applying
with equal if not greater, force to the debts un
provided for, the strongest reasons exist for the
holders of the evidences of State Debts not to
alienate then), for any consideration below their
