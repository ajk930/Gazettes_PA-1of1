FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
JN my la ft, the general principle of honeftv,
as an eilential requisite for a representative
was glanced atâthe idea was suggested that
private and public honesty are to be ailbciated in
scanning the charafrers which ought to arrest
the attention of eledors-âand in fa ft there is
not a more obvious and unerring criterion, to
guide us in our enquiries. It ought to be cfta
blifhed as a maxim in the mind ofeveryele&or,
that he, who dilcovers no regard for those ob-,
ligations of moral, social, and political duty,'
which constitute the beauty, peace and security
of every well regulated community or govern
ment, is not to be depended on in any public
trust whatever.
It may not be improper to sketch a few out
lines of the other requisites neceflary to form
the character of a competent representative.
In this improved state of our country, when,
through the favorable operation of thole wife,
literary institutions which our ancestors efta
blilhecl, and the present age has augmented and
improved, there is so great a proportion of men
of superior attainmentsâat a time when we
fee and realize the immense disproportion be
tween persons of education, and literary im
provements, and those who do not pofTefs those
advantages 5 when we fee the influence this
weight of abilities, must necessarily polTefs in
oppolition to ordinary or medium acquirements
âwhen we consider the important rank which
Pennsylvania holds in the scale of the Unionâ
the idea comes with irrefiftable force, that it
is our indispensable duty to support that rank
by ele&ing persons of the most distinguished a
bilities, natural and acquired, as representatives
in Congcefs to maintain the honor,and advance
the interest of the commonwealth, in connec
tion with that of the union. It is of more im
portance than is generally imagined, that the
public attention should be roused to a consider
ation of this point. Men of conscious honor,
integrity and great abilities, are among the
last in a free community, who are solicitous for
public appointmentsâthey never will lie found
either making direci applications to the people
or uflng indirect methods through the agency of
others, to procure their fuffragesâfuch are the
persons from whom alone we are to expect dis
interested and independent condudt in public
lifeâfuch characters must be fought afterâand
tempted from their retirements by the most
honorable of all inducements, the free unsoli
cited fuffrages of a free community. Men of
this description, when placed on the thea
tre of public life, will be superior to party, pre
judice and passion ; superior to the little con
siderations that warp the needy and felfiih from
the line of re&itude ; and superior to the glare
of sophistry and unprincipled profeflions, which
overpower and bewilder the faculties of unin
formed minds. On this important point a few
additional observations fliall be offered in a fu
ture paper âit may fuffice for the present just
to remark, that integrity and real ability arc more
frequently united than it is for the interest of
some persons toaliowâhencea suspicion of men
of talents is industriously circulated among the
people, by those who hope to find their account
in depreciating the utility of learning ; a more
fatal error cannot be adopted by freemen than
this, that learning, virtue ancj abilities, are pre
judical to the cause of Liberty and the Rights
of Men- C.

GAZETTE. QF THÂ£ UNITED STATES.
Mr. Fenno,
WILL you be so kind as to favor us with
some explanation of t le circumstances
which attended tlie taking of a late Oath, in
vindication of the Secretary of State, which
appeared in your Gazette. Was it i'vrorn upon
the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God ?âDid
the vindicator kiss the ChriftianScriptures upon
the occation ?âDid he appear reverent âas one
who knew the worth and value of thole preci
ous recordsâand who was fenfi'oleof the danger
of a falfe appeal to God ?â-Did he seem to be
impreiTbd with the belief of a particular provi
dence, to animadvert upon falfe swearers* ?â
Or did he scruple the ule of the Scriptures in
| his oath of purgations, and clutfe rather to kiss
I the works of Voltaire, to whom certain pious
[heathens offer incense most devoutly since his
apotheofis?âPerhaps, indeed, he had recourse
to a more substantial patron, and saluted with
devout reverence the Secretary's learned Notes
upon Virginia; where he so wifely attempts to
refute the account of the deluge, which is evi
dently stated by Moses to be a miracle, by a re
currence to philosophical and merely natural
principles. If you can cast any light upon
this dark transaction, you will oblige a number
of your friend*, who consider the appeal to
Heaven, to which 1 allude, as inexpressibly ridi
culous, viewing as they do the character of the
gentleman whose vindication is intended, as
well as that of the vindicator.
I am, your humble servant,
An ENQUIRER.
* See the 36th number of the National Gazetteâ'
tvhere the belief of a particular providence is treated
as an impious tenet.
+ The cuflom of allowing people to purge themselves
by oath, is at this day retained in very Jew fyflems oj
jurisprudence. However, as the Editor of the National
Gazette appears to have a predileflion for the Church oj
Scotland (Tee his paper oj December 8, 1791) where it
is sometimes used, perhaps he embraced the practiceJrom
that refpeflable authority.
FROM THE COLUMBIAN CENT IN LL,
Mr. Russk l l,
BEING riifpofed to dojufticetothe Manufac*
-xutcs of -the-country, aiwi knowing ytrur dis
position to promote so defirablc an object, I wish
you to publish the following faÂ£ls, See.
That in the month of Oilober, 1790, I purchas
ed a quantity of fail cloth of the Bolton Manufac
ture, which I have used on hoard the ship Eliza,
and performed two circuitous voyages from this
port to Charleston, (S. C.) arid Europe, and the
fails are now in so good a Hate, as in my estimation
to be fully equal to any new fails made of Ruflia

since they were made. JOSEPH TILDEN.
EXTRACTS.
" IT is a very popular opinion, that all things
were made for the use of man. According to
this idea, he may cut and carve the good things
of this life, and fay, this nature gave to me,
and I may use it as I please. Wine, in its natu
ral state, has foine of the qualities of fpiritous
liquors, fuchas causing intoxication, andabrifk
circulation of animal fluids; but it is the quan
tity of brandy, which is put into modern wine,
that makes it poisonous.
" We might as well fay, nature made gun
powder for the use of man, as fpiritous liquors;
though Milton in his poem, introduces Satan,
as the inventor of that medley of combustibles.
If he had repre Tented the fame author, as the
firft distiller of spirits, I think it would have
been an improvement of the fubjeft, elpecially
as it is produced by the force of the very ele
ment he lives in, and partakes much of its na
ture, and there is no weapon he has handled
With more success in the misery and deftruttion
of the human race. It has been a practice of
some commanders to use this fiery liquid, to in
spire artificial courage; in this refpeft, gun
powder may be said to be inferior to rum.
(i After all that can be fÂ«iid in favor of the
use of this bewitching poison, I am confident
that the person who has taken a draught, isren
dered less capable of withstanding the tempta
tion to a second. The greatest drunkards have
once abhorred the vice, and have formed relo
hitions to refrain from it, but from a fatal cu
riosity, and above all from afl'ociating withgrog
bruifers, he tries it, he finds it exhileratingâhe
tries it again, and again, till it becomes cor.fti
tuttonal, and thenâfarewell to all EiTays of
" SOBER REASON/'
" GOD tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."
It is methinks, a fen ten ce which contains a sys
tem in itfelfâand it is replete with the quint
eflence of morality, religion and divinityâlt is
replete with morality, for example is cn all
hands allowed to be more influential than pre
cept, and it exhibits a view of the Lord of Uni
versal nature, bestowing such minute regards
upon the feelings of the family which his plastic
word had commanded into being, as to be at
tentive even to the wants of the bleating inno
cent, who, lliorn of its fleecy covering, stands
in need of the vernal zephyr which is then com
milTioned to move lo gently over the warm fur
face of his disrobed body.

The main body of M. la Fayette's

The French camp between Dun

At home the revolution spirit is by

In consequence of several persons

being discovered at Amfterdnm, M.

to the States General, has presented
a memorial, demanding that the cri

be apprehended, and delivered up to
France. The answer of the govern

vife presented a memorial on the
Ã¼bjecft of the insult offered to the

vhich the answer is equally uncer-

P A R I S, June 8.
Tilings in tbemfelves the mod: tri
vial, become of importance in such a
situation as ours. The Municipality
came to afefolution that no person
should be obliged to take any notice
of the procelfion oftheHoft, and liiac
no public force (hould be called oatto attend it. Tliis resolution, which
left every man to do as he pleased,
was represented as an intentional in
sult to the Catholic worship ; and
notwithflanding a heavy rain,the ce
retnony wasyeflerday more pompous
ly celebrated, great nuinber3 of the
troops of the line and national guards
attending, than if lio such resolution
had been palled.
The arrival of M. d'Orleansat Va
lenciennes having been made a pre
text for circulating a report among
the troops, that the greater part of
their officers meant to quit the ser
vice. Marshal Luckner gave out in
general orders, that he lliould consi
der all reports tending to produce
jealousy and disunion in the army as
a personal injury to himfelfâand that
he knew of but one partyâthe glory
of France, and the maintenance of
her conflitntion.
The Secretary for foreign affairs,
named Dumorier, threatened the
world with a relignation, when it was
in agitation to bring him to account
for the fix millions paid into his
hands for secret purposes, fnch as fo
menting discord and revolt in the
neighbouring countries. But when,
through the interference of his good
friend's, it was decreed that he might
do -what he pleased with the inconsi
derable sum, he condescended to re
main in office for thegtod oj his country.
Every time M. Chabot comes about
with hisimpeaching budget, the ears
of the auditory are wounded by in
decent expreflions, slanderous re
ports and criminal defamation,which,
in the reign of the law, would have
brought down condign punishment oil
the head of him who would have
dared to use them. On Monday he
accused almost all the honcft men in
the kingdomâhis proofs, as he mo
destly called the infignificant firing
of evidence he adduced, were chief
ly colleiled froin anonymous letters,
the information of servants discharg
ed from refpetftable families, for va
rious difdemeanors ; drunken coach
men, and lazy footmenâhe denoun
ced The Gazette UrtiverfA't as a dan
gerous libel ; (because it never Si
mulates to murther, or infurreiftion)
lie accused La Fayette, Rochambeau,
and the deceased General Dillon, as
friends to a Counter-Revolution, &c.
âThough hooted by his brethren,
his documents were re.ferred to a
committee, those excepted which cri
minated the Generals, now at the
head of the army. I fliall only fay
one word more of mailer Chabotâit
was moved by a member of his own
party, that he fliould be sent to pri
son, if not to bedlam.
Gen. Arthur Dillon has been once
more to the aflembly to solicit justice
for the memory of his departed re
lative i he was accompanied by Chau
roont who begged permiflion to be
present on the day of the report, he
afl'ured them he would prove that his
Gen. was all bravery, goodness, ho

were received with diftin<slion.
Lettsrs from Tournay, May 29.
The French 3000 in number, at
tempted to take by aflault a chapel,
called Notre-dame-de-Bon-fecoursâ
which is said to be rich. The Prince
of Ligne was informed of it, and re
solved to defend it with 800 grena
diers. Having chosen a very strong
station, he obliged the besiegers to
retire, with some confufion. The
Prince look advantage of it, pursued,
killed 4c, and took 12 pri Toners, with
some field pieces and provisions.
M. Chabot a member of the Na
tional Aflembly attempied to enter
the terrace of Keuillans with a Tword
cane, and was disarmed by the cen
tinel Rationed there, who had posi
tive orders so to do.
In his anger at the supposed insult,
which was owiugto a prudential re
gulation of police, he wrote the fol
lowing infelent letter to the King.
" That the King of the French
should prohibit entrance into his pa
lace to perfens armed, the writer
would think a precaution juftified by
the distrust to which the conduct of
the court has given rife. But to cause
to be disarmed, nt the entrance of a
garden, public in its nature, or by the
permission of the proprietors, cause
a reprefentativeof the fovereigu, sole
proprietor of that garden, to'be dis
armed, is insulting to the nation,
and of a piece with that Aoftrian fy*
tem which tends to debase the Ns
tional Aflembly. ThefubfcriberhopÂ«&
the King of the French will give or
ders that his cane be returned, and
will take away a centinel insulting
to the people we represent.

NATiO.NAL ASSEMBLY, June 5.
The Hector of St. Germain l'Aux
errois invited the Aflembly to affitl
by a deputation at the procelfion of
the Hofl on Thursday. An order
was made to this effeifi, which was no
sooner pad than several members mov
ed that it ihould be reported, or in
other words, revoked. On the other
[fide it was said, that to revoke this
oruer would be to declare that they
had completely set aside the national
religion ; and it was agreed that the
Aflembly Ihould not fit on Thursday,
that every member might be at liber
ty to attend such religious ceremony
as he thought proper.
M. Arthur Dillon appeared at the
bar, and requested a f'peedy report on
the papers before the committees, in
proof of the innocence and patriotism
of his unfortunate relation viho was
murdered at Li fie.
The numbering of afligngts was
fliewn to be no check to counterfeit
ing, and the expence of it was calcu
lated to amount to near 560,000 li
vres on the large affignats, and to
upwards of 2,000,000 on the fmair.
It was proposed, instead of this mode
of proceeding, to divide them simply
into series, this way ; â2OOO affignats
of the series of 2 livres, 10 sols, and
so on, down to the affignats of 10 sols.
This was adopted.
At twelve, the order of the day
was taken up,âthe discussion on the
Auftrim Committee. Mr. Chabot as
cended the tribune to prove the ev
idence of this conspiracy againfl the
conflitution- [A sketch of this speech
would be lengthy, uninterefling, and,
to us, in agreat degree unintelligible.
The French Editor concludes his ac
count of the speech, as follows
All the facfls, all the letters, all the
depositions brought forward by the
orator prove at least, that there are
ill intentioned people, great crimes
unpunished, criminals that ought to
be prosecuted and be made to feel the
severity of the law.â But ft ill one
would ask, Where are the guilty ?
Where are the members of the Au
llrian committee ? We would wifli
to hear their names, âto fee them
Where are they ?
The difcufiion was interrupted by
Mr. Servan, who came to thank the
aflembly for the confidence they had
(hewn him, and to communicate a
project which he conceived eflential
to the fafety and tranquility ofFrance.
A decree commands a repetition of
the ceremony of the federation 011
the 14th of July in each year. M.
Servan proposed a general federation
on the next 14th of July, at which
deputations from the National Guards
of the whole kingdom should aflift,
and then, that they should be organ'
ized and aflift in securing the tran
quility of the capital. Referred to
the committee of legislation and pub
lic inftrmfiion.
We this moment received a letter,
dated Rome, May 16, from which we
extract what follows.
" The Holy Father returned to
this city three days after that fixed
for his return. He is arrived in per

cribe the joy of all ranks at his fafe
arrival : He was, in a manner, car

During the Pope's journey, a
Frenchman, in a fn.all fifherman's
canoe, was landing near the Pontini
marshes. The centinel potted there

wounded him in the legs. The tra

Great-Britain had the powers of

to contend with ? Was he to wait for
inftrticftion at a time when the delay
of a moment would rob us of every
valuable possession in India ? Sure
not. Common sense, natural n ru .
dence forbade it.
What he did was right, and hs
mould venture to fay, if it was wrong
Mr. Hastings alone was not culpable
âThe " black malignancy of mind"
â " The dark and deep malice of
heart" did not singly centre in the

the full force and meaning of the
word accomplices to Mr. Hastings'
guilt : together they must stand, to
gether they must fall.
Mr. Dallas pursued this idea to its;
extent, and dwelt upon it with full
force of argument : after which he
went extensively into the condntfof
Cheyt Sing, and continued speaking
until five o'clock when the court
broke up.
In compliance with the Petition of
Mr. Hastings to his Majelty, the House

In the Supreme Court of the United States,
at their late feflion in this city, the Attorney-
General, in his official capacity, and of his own
mere motion, applied fbr a mandamus to the
circuit courts of Pennsylvania, to proceed un
der the pension law paired aÂ£ the last feflion of
Congress.
That law, it will be remembered, imposes
certain duties on the federal judges, which the
circuit courts of Pennsylvania and New-York
judged unconstitutional, and which the firft en
tirely refuted to execute'.
The firft question that arose was independent
of the main question, viz.âWhether it was part
of the duty of the Attorney-General of the
United States, to superintend the decisions of
the inferior courts, and if to him they appeared
improper, to move the supreme court for a re
vision.
Opinions were much divided.
In fayorof the Attorney-General's exercising
. this power, the following are the heads of the
principal arguments insisted on:âThe analogy
between the nature of that office here and in
EnglandâThat part of the judiciary ast which
gives the Attorney-General a fuperintendance
over the courts of the United States in the
courts of justice, which, giving latitude to the
word concern, brought the cafe within the power
granted by the law ; and the Attorney-General
being the only officer of the supreme executive
to whom the constitution gives a fuperintend
ance over the execution of all the laws of the
Union.
Against this opinion it war, alledged, that the
analogy drawn was not found, but rather dan
gerous y that the latitude given to the word
concern, would tend to give that officer a right,
officially, to interfere in any law controversy
between citizen and citizen, as the United States
were concerned in feeing justice done in every
cafeâand that as the ast of the Attorney-Gene
ral was not within his ordinary duty, it would
require special authority from the supreme ex
ecutive to eftablifli its propriety.
These were the principal heads of the argu
ments used. The discussion was -full, and the
bench divided on the question. Judges Iredell,
Johnson, and Blair, declaring in favor of the
Attorney-General, and Judges Wilfon,Culhing,
and the Chief Justice, entertaining the contrary
opinion. ,
This equal division was fufficient to rejefl
the mode of proceeding Mr. Randolph firft
adopted, who then started an another ground,
as counsel for a petitioner \yho had been unfuc
cefsful in his application to the diftritt court
of Pennsylvania.
His motion, after being accompanied with
the reafoas which influenced him to believe
that the inferior court') had erred, was post
poned for a final decision until the next court.

A droll adventure lately happened near St. Car

io many rich princes and prelates, and highly com
mended the system of equalization established in
Trance ; when one of the labourers suddenly in
terrupted him, and lifting up his tray of wet mor
tar, olaced it on the Frenchman's head, laying,
4i Let us here try your system of equality; I car
ried up the last tray, do you carry up this." The
Frenchman being decently dreflTed, was heartily
enraged at the compliment, and got away as well
as he could to complain of the insolence. Fie was
Heartily laughed at; and it isfaid that he has since
left the town.

What a different spirit is discovered in the
following extract. N. B. The above slander
is anonymous.
Robert Rutherford, Ffq. is a candidate for the re
presentation in Congress of the Dijlrift which Alex
ander White, Ffq has hitherto reprejented.âln
the Potowmack Guardian of 6th injl. appeared an \
Addrefsy signed a Farmer ; the following extract
from Mr, Whitens answer on the 13th, will explain
the motives of competition : thistxtraft, is highly in
terejlifig, as it fetves to explain and set in a fair
and candid point of view, several travfactions which
have been miflated andgrojily mifr.epi efented :
16 Mr. Farmer fay*, that by the aiTumption
of the State debts, Virginia lias loft. near a mil
lion of money, and that I could have prevented
it.âTo which I answerâthat the assertion is
totally unfoundedâthat Mr. Rutherford, with
all his knowledge of the affairs of this State and
of the Union, cannot produce documents to
give it the semblance of truth.âOn the con
trary, more than one third of the interest of
the State Debts is done away, and the remain
der thrown into a channel which puts it out of
the power of (heriffs to vilit and diftrefsthe peo*
pieâthe great reduction of taxes at the fame
time that ample provision is made for all the
exigencies of government, confirms this afler
tion. I could not have prevented the parage
of the ast, the majority was such that m v vote
would not have affected the question in
stage of the bufmefs. I mention this only to
shew the little attention Mr. Farmer pays to
truth. âI am wjljing to give fmtlier trxplaiia-.
tions on this and all other fubjefts to every can
did inquirerâbut I make no apologyâleast of
all that which Mr. Farmer makes for me, be
cause the Journals of Congress would teftify
'against me.âThe Northern Members never
con fen ted that the feat of government ,/hould
be 011 the Potowmacânot a member voted for
that bill whole local interest did not lead him
to do so ; and several of the Southern Member*,
those too, who were moil felicitous to obtain
the aftumption, voted again ft it. I agree that
the Federal City is situated where it ought to
beâbut if you will take the trouble to calculate
the proportion between the inhabitants North
and East of the Potowmac, and those South and
Weft of it, you will find the question will not
appear so lelf evident as Mr. Farmer supposes.
In fact it required unremitted attention and
great Legislative abilities to carry that mea
sure, and I do not hefrate to fay, that the Vir
ginia delegation deserved the grateful thanks
of their country for their exertions on the oc
casion."

On account of the incurf.ons of the Indians

b'at when peace ihall be concluded with the In
dians, the greatest part of the expence of go
vernment, including that of the army, will not
amount to one hundred thouiand pounds itcr
linjr, which, as has been already stated is but an
eighteenth part of the expences of the Englilh
government.
I request Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundas, and all
Hpfe who are talking of constitutions, and
leflings, and Kings, and Lords, and the Lord
nows what, to look at this flatement. Here
: a form ahd system of government, that is fcxjt
er organized and better administered than any
government in the world, and that lor less than
)ne hundred thousand pounds per annum, and
yet every member of Congress receives, as a
compensation for his time and attendance on
public business, one pound seven fliillings per
day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred
pounds a year."
It appears from the foregoing extra&s, that
Mr. Paine does not think lb badly either of the j
constitution, or of the adminijlration of the go-;
vernment of the United States, as our reformers
at homeâhe expressly pronounces that govern
ment not only to be tetter organized, but better
sdminijltred than any government in the world.
That gentleman is in a situation to fee the af
fairs of this country impartially. Well inform
ed of what has been done, and at a diftancefrom
the factions which are among us, he judges from
f&Rs and their confequevces, unwarped by the pas
sions of rivalfhip, which are so apt to discolour
objedts, and give them a falfe appearance. The
authority of Mr. Paine on this it is
prelumed will have weight,with the clamourers.
COMMUNICATIONS.
The enemies of government affect to be afraid
of the arbitrary power of Congrels. They
tremble to fee every thing depend on a loose
cjifcretton which is not tied down by the constitu
tion and fixed unalterable principles of law and
reason. They abhor the funding system also.
Mark their inconsistency. They would keep
the public creditors dependent on yearlygrantsâ
why?âto prevent a great monied interest con
nected with government. Would not their
plan, however, produce this connexion in its
worst form ? by creating and continuing an en
tire dependence of the certificate holders on
the majority of the two houses. Let the ex
ample of the states decide the point.
Further, these consistent fault-finders would
have had Congress aflume an unlimited power;
over the debtâand give much or little to.the j
creditors, and divide that too with the original j
holders, in such proportions as they in their dif-l
cretion should deem proper. What beeomes of
the arbitrary discretion of Congress in this af
fair? Would not these second-sighted men, who
spy iniquity in public faith and justice, and the
danger of arbitrary power in governing by fixed
and equal laws, which regard rights and not
persons, would not they have been the firft to
cry out, Congress is more dejpotic than the Grand
Turkâthey have despised their plighted Jaith âthey
have dijhonoured the nation-~they pretend to be above
law and right.
As Congress took the plain old path which
the old Congress pointed out, the Prelident fo-l
leninly recommended in his public addreires, 1
and all America expected, the style of accusa
tion mult be conformed to what they have done.
For to certain people who are hunting for
faults, nothing is more acceptable than to find
gameâyet, even if they miss it, they must fire
off their pieces.
The United States, while provinces, used to
boast of their liberty, and justly; which of them
had a charter so favorable to the equal rights
of men as the conftitutionoftbe United States ?
Yetaparty is trained to abuse those men as ene
mies of a free government, who are disposed to
carry that constitution, and the laws palled un
der its authority, into effedt.
With one voice, the patriots and pliilofophers
of Europe call on government for duties to
check the immoderate ule of spirituous liquors.
The order of things seems, in our country, to
be inverted. Men, pretending to be both pa
triots and philosophers, condemn the excise.â
The use that some persons make of the unpopu
larity of the worA-excifcy shews how much better
some quack philosophers love power, than their
country or the sciences.

In sober times men attend only to fa&s. But
when they get carried away by their palfions,
very often those things make themoft impreflion
which have the least foundation. The imagi
nation, when disturbed, always paints bigger
than the lifeâFancy peoples her own creation
with nothing less than giants. Besides, things
which do not admit of proof, cannot on the
other hand be disproved. They take pofleffion
of the mind, and not unfrequently when good
sense is disposed to come home again, it is re
fufed admittance. The junto, therefore, who
wifti to prepare the people for the talk they are
ready to undertake of demolishing all (they com
plain of all) that the new government has set
up, very properly address themselves to men's
paflions. What topic'for inflaming the multi
tude against the laws and the law-makers has
been left untried! The angry, the proud, the
jealous and the weak, are all addrefled. Twice
a week they conjure up evil spirits from the
dark to haunt the (ick imagination. But the
found sense of an enlightened nation, poifeffing
every privilege, and deserving what it poiTeffes,
clifllpates the fantaftic fliadows of party delu
sion, as the waking faculties scatter the visions
of a disturbed sleep.

Di ed on Saturday last, after a short but painful
illness, Mr. JOSEPH FEW, of this city; a Wor
thy and ufeful citizen ; who, since the revolution
(in which he took an a&ive part as an officer ct
our army) hath employed himfelf in bringing to
I great pcrfeftion a number of ufeful mjnufaÂ£tories
and valuable inventions for the benefit of this
country, and, we hope, for the emolument of his
virtuous aud amiable widow, family and fortune.
He was the firft that patronized, and brought to
ufeful application, Mr. James Rumfty's patented
improvement of Dr. Barker's rototary water-wheel,
by which power he was enabled, under a very
light fleam of water, to conftruft a variety of valu
able machinery for the manufa&uring of muftatd,
{larch hair-powder, tobacco, fnufr, chocolate,
fhclled and pearl barley, split peas, &c. See. all of
of which fcvcral articles, were carried on in an
extensive fort, without any patronage from public
authority. Pun&ual and just in his dealingâhu
mane and liberal to the poorâWarm and ileadv
in his friencifhip, and a flcady patron of all ufeful
inventions or improvements, it may be truly said,
that the inhabitants of Philadelphia and citizens of
