President retired, and a 16th toast was drank,
" ThePRHSiDENT of the United State.s."
In the evening a Ball, in honor of the Presi
dent, was given at the Long Room in the Fila
ture. At half past 8 o'clock the President ho
nored the company with his presence, and was
personally introduced by one of the Managers
to 96 ladies, who were elegantly drefied, foirie
of whom displayed infinite rafte in the emblems
and devices on their faflies and head drefles, out
of respect to the happy occasion.
The room, which had been lately haiulfomely
fitted up, and was well lighted, afforded the
President an excellent opportunity of viewing
the Fair Sex of our city and vicinity, and tlve la
dies the gratification of paying their refperts to
our Federal Chief.
After a few minuets were moved, and one
country dance led down, the President and his
Suite retired about 11 o'clock. At 12 o'clock the
flipper room was opened, ai.d the Indies partook
of a repalt, after which dances continued till 5
o'clock. The company retired with the happy
fatisfaftion of having generally contributed to
wards the hilarity and gdiety of the evening.
On Saturday morning the President, attended
by Gen. M'lntodi and leveral ethdr gentlemen,
took a view of the remaining traces of the lines
conftruifted by the Britifti for the defence of Sa
vannah in 1779 ; the General having been se
cond in command under Gen. Lincoln at IVorm
ing thetn had an opportunity of giving an ac
count of every thing interesting during the liege
and in the attack.
In the afternoon the Prefidenc honored the
Citizens with his company at a dinner prepared
for him under a beautiful arbor, supported by
three rows of pillars, entirely covered with lan-,
rel and bay leaves, so as to exhibit uniform green
columns. The pillars were higher than the ar
bor, and ornamented above it by feftoons, and
con itemed below by arches covered in the fame
wanner. The place on which it flood was ju
diciously chosen, presenting at once a view of
the city and of the fbipping in the harbor, with
an extensive profpetft of the river and rice lands
boih above and below the town. But the prin
cipal advantage which resulted from its lunation
and ftruftnre was the opportunity which -it af
forded to a great body of people to have a dif
tin ft and uninterrupted view of that object to
which all eyes and hearts appeared to be at
tracted.
A company of nearly 200 citizensand strangers
dined under it, and the fatisfac'lion which each
one enjoyed in paying this personal tribute to
the merit of a man who is, if poffihle, more be
loved for his goodtrefsthan admired for his great
ness, produced a degree of â convivial and har
monious mirth rarely experienced.
Every one beheld with delight in the person
of our President, the able General, the virtuous
Patriot, the profound Politician ; in a word, one
of the mod shining ornaments that ever digni
fied h uin'an nature.
The Artillery Company dined under another
arbor eredled at a small diihince, and received
merited applauTe for the great dexterity which
they displayed in firing at each roast. 1 heir
fires were returned by Korc Wayne, and the ihip
Thomas \Vilfon, which was moored opposite to
Saturday, June 4, 1791-
the arbor ; herdecorartohS through the day, and
illumination at night, had a fine effect.
The following toalVs were given : The United
States of America. Prosperity to the citizens of
Savannah audits vicinity [/?>' the Prefide>U~\ The
Fair of America. The Vice-President of the
United States. The memorable Era of Inde
pendence. The Count d'Eftaing. The memory
of Gen. Greene. The Arrs and Sciences. The
memory of thofc brave men who fell before
the Lines of Savannah on the yth of Odtober,
i 779. The Friends to free and equal government
throughout the globe. All Foreign powers in
PriendThip with rhe United States. May Religi
on and Philosophy always triumph over Super
fli ion pnd Prejudice in America. The present
dexterous Corps of Artillery [The Prejldent's
roajl.] (/ifter the President retired,) The Pre
side nt of the United States.
The conftrutftion of the arbor, and the manner
in which die entertain input was provided and
conducted, did great honor to the gentlemen to
whose direction the whole " as committed.
Jn the ovaniiig ihere 3 hnndiome exhibi*
lion of fireworks, and the amusements of this
clay of joy and feltivity were concluded by a Con
cert.
On Sunday morning the President attended di
vine service in Chriit Church, and soon after let
out 011 his way toAugufta. On taking his leave
of the Mayor and committee of the Citizens he
politely exprefled his fenfeof the attentions I'iewn
him by the Corporation and every denomination
of people during his Hay in Savannah. He was
attended out of the city by a number of gentle
men, and escorted by a detachment of Augusta
dragowns commanded by Major Ambrose Gordon.
the Spring Hill the President was received by
Gen. Jackson, where the Artillery and Light In
fantry Companies were drawn up, and was there
saluted by 59 discharges from the lieldpieces and
IZ vollies of platoons. After which he proceed
ed with several gentlemen .to Mulberry Grove,
the feat of the late Major General Greene, where
lie dined, aYTft then refuiiVed hi* tour.
It is highly pleasing to a grateful and patriot
ic mmd to reflect upon the happy consequences
which will probably _flow from the to\ir which
the President isliow performing. His admira
ble qualiries had long since extended his fame to
the ntmofl: of civilization, but it is only
by personal interviews that a jult idea can be
acquired of the amiablenefs of his temper and
his engaging manners. The Intelligent serenity
of his countenance, the unaffected ease and dig
nity of his deportment, while they excite the
1110 ft profound respect, naturally rivet the affec
tions to hiin. As the most unlimited confidence
is reposed in his prudence, abilities, and patriot
ic, this effeiS miilt have essential influence in,
giving energy to that government in the adminj
illration of which he has so considerable a part J

TO FARMERS.
EVERY mcafure fiiould be adopted by the
owners of lands, lo lave timber. Every
Farm fliould be hedged for outside fences, and
dry ditches made to separate fields.
With refpecft to fencing. From the great ease
of propagation and rapid growth of the yellow
willow, it might certainly be made a good fence
by setting the flips very close in double or even
treble rows. These may be taken from even the
(Vnalleft branches or the largest ltalks of willow.
All w ill grow, and may be set at any time of the
year. When at a fufficient height, they (hould
be fallen or cut off. least they blow up by the
roots, and make breaches.âThough in many
parts of Germany, many of the lands are lup
ported with fuel intirely from the branches and
tops taken off their hedge-trees, being willows,
&c.
Bur the more formidable and permanent
hedge-fence, is the thorn. This is more trou
blesome to propagate, and flow in its growth.

TO ELLA.
HARK! while I found my trembling shell,
And bid the nymph, sweet ccho tell;
Wnerc on her velvet couch (he Ii s,
Hid from the gairifh burning fluo;
How the foul-enlivening fouqd
Of thy enchanting lyre,
Was borne on Ether's waves around,
Fiom each foft-fpeaking wire.
Twas when beside the wizard stream,
I saw the fun's last golden beam,
"With yellow tip the aspiring heads,
Of timc-contending oaks, the king of (hades !
I the night ffies buzzing round,
I heard the beetle's humming found :
My foul to sober thought inclin'd,
Thus ran the current of my mind.
N Â» longer now my checks disclose,
The beauty of the budding role ;
No longer, as in former days,
I joy, the sprightly laugh to raise.
Of then each lovely, summer's night,
'Twas my enraptured foul's delight,
To tread the lonely silent vale,
And *' drink the spirit of the gale
Or wh<*n the cloudlcfs moon on high,
Beam'd forth her radiance from the flcy :
To wander o'er the airy hill,
Where pattering falls the lucd rill;
And fee the wild fl w'r> Aiming bight,
Crown'd with the tears of weebing night.
ButO! the wondrous change!
Now. if delights me not to range,
The fields and vall'es, bright and
With beauties of the laughivg May.
When the fhiill fpiritsof the coming dorm,
Th ir shrieks of terror pour along the wind ;
And fiercer raging all itu.- grove deform,
The branches tear, ana shatter down the rind :
Wheri heav'ns bright fires def< ending from on high.
An awful day slash thro' the gloomy Qry*
And from their dwellings the hoarse thunders roar,
And dusky torrents down the vallies pour :
'Tis ihen my foql enjoys the dreadful hour,
And bows m\ God ! in rev'rence to thy power.
'Twas thus I mus'd, when borne along the air,
Thy heavenly notes came trembling on my ear ;
Sweet as the gentlest showers
Of spring, descending on the flowers,
When murmuring Zephyr finks to reft,
Soft-fighing on the lily's breast.
Ah ! wouldft thou with thy arm sustain
My weaned form, and footbe my pain ?
And would ft thou all the lingering Eve,
With thy foft founds my foul relieve ?
And haftihou learn'd the healing charm,
The power to bid the tyrant sickness fly ?
O ! hither come, extend tb\ potent arm,
And bid the beam of Hopefkand sparkling in my eye !
Ah ! now, ev'n now, this very hour,
I contefs thy magic power !
Charm'd with thy notes divine,
No more my troubled foul,
Or scenes of horror loves to brood,
N<Â« more my freezing blood,
In !a7y tides doth roll;
Bright in my eye the tears of rapture fliine,
Thro'all my nerves I feel a tremor run,
Now cold as Zambia's (now, nnw f. rvid as the fun,
O ! may thy generous sympathising heart,
Ne'er teel the anguish of afÃifiton's dart ;
May dreams of earthly * eafure on thee flow,
That thou, the pur* celfftial joy may'it know,
To bid the b ggar fm.'le, and cheer his hou/e of zvoe.

TO THE PUBLIC.
CON IDERING the knowledge of the pro
perties and virtues of medicine of such va(l
importance and necelfity, in order to adtniniller
it with prop ie?y and fafery, I have ventured to
off-r my fen ments, (which ate ihe result of a
v ety of ex icrimems and observations) to the
Public in general, on the medicinal qualities and
efWis of the celebrated Spring in New-Leba
non.
r rom a variery of experiments that I have
made (which are too numerous to insert here)
it appears that the water is podefied of several
valuable properties ; two of the mod important
thai 1 have difrovered are an alkalefcenr quality,
and 3 deg; ee of fixed air. But the water, with
all its pi ope ies, is not an infallible fpecific for
every difcife, i hough alinolt every kind of inva
lids attend it.
i here are a great number who attend the
POOL, that might receive benefi'., which do not,
on account oi i ne mifapplica i >11 of ihe water.

For tx 'ripleâfuppofe a medicine is held up

it will undoubtedly be of very gi eat pu ic i
For exampleâlast fum.ner a gentleman the
Faculty viiW the POOL to regain his health,
(being in a very infirm state) but the comnio
nfe of the water alone, proved detriments o
him- whereupon he made use of la ' >
medicine, (which had proved lneffetfual alone)
together with ihe water, which proved, (as
have fmce heard) a radical cure for his disorder.
A variety of similar cases might be mentioned ;
but a publication of this kind will nor admit of it.
I expeA to publilh more largely, after the en
suing season.
By i equeft of a number of my friends, in con
currence with my own inclination âI have un
dertaken to keep a register of every disease,
symptom, age and sex of the patient ; with the
method of applying the water ; which is an un
dertaking that has long been required.
Any gentleman that wishes for mj advice,may
find me living within a few rods of the Spring,
where 1 expect to be able to fatisfy any gentle
man's curiosity with regard to the quality of the
water, &c. &c

CONSTANTINOPLE, Jan. 25
THE late misfortunes experienced by the Ot
toman arms, have thrown this city into con
sternation and fright, but the Grand Signior has
abated nothing of his haughtiness and inflexibi
lity.
It is said that the Sultana Valide, having, at
the solicitation of the principal people of the
empire, endeavored to employ that influence
which ftie had over him, to enduce him to enter,
as soon as poflible, into a negociation with Ruf
fia, the Sultan treattd her with the greatest
liat jhnefs, and confined her to the old Seraglio.
lie ascribes to the Divine difileafure all the
misfortunes which he has experienced, which he
hopes to fofien, by recalling ihe Muffulmen to a
more rigid observance of the laws of their reli
gion : he has, in consequence, given the ftâ  iotell
orders that all di inkiug-houfes should be iliu;
up, not only in Constantinople, but throughout
the empire.
These orders have produced a violent fermeir
among the people, who, notwithstanding ihe
precepts of their Prophet, are much addicted to
wine, and a general rifitig could only have been
prevented by ttie greatest vigilance. Eight days
only have been allowed to the Christians to lay
in a store for fix months, and the foreign min
ilters have been ordered to give in an account
of the quantity of wine which will be necellary
for the confuinprion of their households.
VIENNA,
The public do. not expecft a peace : They can
not imagine that our Court will abandon Russia,
and remain without allies, or that the negocia
tions at Siftovia will terminate by a difinitive
treaty, before it is known what the Court of
Rufiia may hope or fear from the allied powers
who interest themselves in the fate of the Otto
man empire.
SARDINIA
The spirit of liberty is daily spreading. Some
very serious risings of the people have taken
place in Sardinia. The King has given orders
for the marching of 10,000 men, to prevent the
meetings, or to disperse the people who may
have so aflembled.
PARI S, March to.
At five o'clock yellerday afternoon te deum

Majesty's Minilters, aflifted at the ceremony,
which was grand and brilliant. At the conclu
sion, the bands of music belonging to the mili

favourite airs, as ca ira : Ou peut-on etre m'teux

that on the following Sunday, Te Deum would be

A memorial was read to the Aflembly, dating,

LONDON, Ap>il 3
The French king's aunts had very powerful
reasons to wish to leave France, it being disco
vered that they had been deeply engaged in abet
ting, planning and forwat ding the conspiracy of
Lyons ; or in other words,in furnifliing inunenfe
sums to bring that infernal plot to the wished for
end. The bnfinefs is now before a committee of
enquiry, and proofs the mod incontrovertible
appear against them. The conspirators will be
instantly tried and the whole appear in puris na
turalibtis.
Thursday night lottery tickets were so low as
Ceventy guineasâand at that price there were in

The late Earl of Strafford was the fourth from
the friend of Charles the First, who did not long
survive the execution of his favorite upon the

The colledlion made at the London Tavern,
by the benevolent Society of St. Patrick, amount
ed (including 100 guineas each from the Prince
of Wales and Duke of York) to the unprece
dented ftim of 12001. The company present were
about 600, of which the majority were Irilh; but
in the minority there was not a kingdom, or
even a colony in his Majesty's dominions, that
had not its proper representatives. Or. Lord
ftawdon's health being drank, his Lordlhip, af
ter thanking the company, took occasion to ob
serve, that all difti ndtions between kingdoms un
der the fame sovereign were in fadt idle, except
those that tended to promote an honorable emu
lation, and a principle of probity. Thus far,
said his Lordship, my ideas of Nationality extend,
but no fartherâFor it is my opinion that he who
prefers any man from the single circumltance of
his having been born in the fame country, to a
more worthy candidate of any other, not only in
dulges a very reprehensible prejudice, but de
grades the cause he wiflies to support. National
partiality, within proper reftri<stien, is natural
and laudable; beyond that, it is illiberal and
unjnft
The offenfive remark given to the British Mi
lifter at Peterfburgh, is said to be'in substance
as follows: ' I am iniftrefs of my own adtions,
the free executrix of my own councils ; if mjr
measures give offence to the British Court, the
British Minister inay retire.'
All the convidls, since their arrival on board
the veflels at Gravefend, have been stripped of
their clothing ; the heads of both men and wo

bis bed speeches for the preservation of his head

Dr. Price lies dangerously ill at his house in

It is scarcely credible, but the fa<ft is so, that
there are American 2,etlots in this city, who are

But John Bull is a sturdy fellow, and though he
does pay plenty of taxes, he is not very easily to
be persuaded that Old England is not the belt
place in the worldâthat King George is not the
best King in Europeâand that he does not enjoy
as much liberty as is neceflary for the happhiefo
of a rational being,
Though John Wefley was a thin man, his boneJ

IMPF. RI A L GOLD MEt) A I
Last week, Mr. Alexander Bruce, late mer
chant in the Weft Bow, but who has now re
tired frotn business, received as a present from
the Empress of Rnlfia, a gold medal of the fir ft
magnitude, a great number of which of different
lizes her Imperial Majesty ordered to be struck,
for the purpose of bestowing upon those whose
merits she might think entitled them to that
mark of her favor. This medal weighs about
twenty guineas in gold. On the one fide is an
elegant bull: of the Empress : On the other, aca
pital and well executed representation of the sta
tue of Czar Peter the Great 011 horseback, at St.
Pete {burgh, whose pedestal is theiminenfe piece
of rock brought to that city at so much labor and
expense.
This medal to Mr. Bruce was accompanied
with a flattering letter from the Empress's firft
minister, Count de BefborodkofF, and another
from his Excellency Count Woronzow, her Im
perial Majesty's Ambaflador at London.
Asthereafon for this dillingnifhed mark of fa
vour conferred upon Mr. Bruce, it is neceflavy
to mention, that that gentleman, several years
ago, had cotnpofeda molt ingenious trearife, in
tituled, " An enquiry into the pi incipal cause of
the wide deftrudtion of mankind in time of war,
and of the flow ineffectual progress and perma
nency of military and naval operations in gene
ral; comprehending the source of plague through
out the world."
Mr. Bruce, hearing of a great many deaths in
the garrison of Cronftadt, presented a manufcripr
copy of the above treatise to the late brave and
justly celebrated Admiral Greig, who, upon pe
rnfal of it, was so well pleased with the doc
trines it contained, that he determined to put
them in practice, and fotfn fouud their f.lutary
efFe<fts, by the preservation of the lives of thou
sands of his soldiers and sailors, who otherwise,
in all human probability, would have perished,
as had been fatally experienced on former oc
calions.
This induced the Admiral to communicate the
matter to his Royal Mistress, who immediately
commanded the treanfe to be translated itito the
Ruffian language by Mr. Nikettin, principal of
the college at Cronftadt, and at the fame time
ordered a very handsome present to Mr. Bruce,
which was tranftnitted to him bv Admiral Greig,
â¢with that politeness for which he was ever re
markable.
The medal which Mr. Bruce has now received,
was long since intended to have been sent. But,
owingto the unfoi tunate death of Admiral Greig,
and the fit ft minister of RuJlia knowing no orher
address for Mr. Bruce, than, " Mr. Bruce at
Edinburgh " it his lain in the Ambaflador's
hands at London (ince Augnft last.

A letter from Petersburg inform?, that the Empress of Rufiia
is making immense preparations to guaid and secure the fron
tiers of the empireâthey could not be greater if a war was inevi
table. In Livonia and Courland are 60 battalions of infantry,
22 of grenadiers, 80 squadrons of cavalry, and 12 regiments of
light troopsâall of which have seen service', many more regi
ments, and 200 pieces of artillery, are to be addedâsoc pieces
of cannon have been sent to Riga and Dunaburgh. The prepara
tions on the fide of White Rufiia are equally great; the number
of large battering pieces destined for "Skloff and Mof

men in Little Rufiia.

A late writer in a London paper on bodily exercise, lays it down
as a position, that walking is the most perfect exercise for the
human body ; every limb is put in motion ; every artery from
the hea r t to the extremities propels the blood quicker and more

d rawn from the h?ad and upper parts, where it is most flow and
languid , and is circulated with rapidity to every part.

Diflin&ions will take place among mankind, so long as there
is any difference between an honest man and a knave.
Were all the words now uled to express our approbation of
merit, to become extindt, would the difference between right and
wrong, truth and faljhood be diminifliedâor could that difference
be annihilated ?âTill human nature becomes totally changed,
the impulse to virtue and patriotism, must be adapted to the prin
ciple of emulationâa human being without this principle, is
" Fit for Treasons, Stratagems and Spoils."
The abolition of tnoft titles now in use, is perhaps the neceflary
result of that severe and just invelligation which many cuitoms and
habits, long faniltoned by ignorance and prejudice, have under
goneâthe abuse of a thing often leads to its disuse and reprobati
onâBut mankind will fuppiv the vacuum which their own hands
â¢lave madeâand often do it to their cost. Cromwelljuftly observ
ed, that his power was more secure, exercised by him as Lord
ProteSor, than it would be, Ihould he aflume the title of Kingâ
the prerogatives of a king, said he, are knownâthose of a protec
tor are undefined, and consequently unlimited.
To fay there shall be no titles or diftinftisns legally annexed to
merit and otfice, is in fact, to open the widest door, to the most
ulfome, flattering, absurd and abominable epithets that the grati
tude, wcaknefs, ignorance and folly of mankind can adopt for
they will have their savoriesâand to fay that they shall not
express their feelings in their own way, is to deprive them of the
liberty of speechâAnd if it is left optional to withhold or bejlow
what titles they please, experience shews that their inventions are
unlimited. However, there can be no doubt that the titles now
i i use, havebcen used long enoughâand if there is no other ob
jection againftthein, their age is enough to ensure their condem-

Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Neiv-Tork,
J - Â°
/o his friend in this city
" I HAVE jult finifhed Cecilia, and agreea
bly to your request, will transmit to you some
irleas which occurred to me on a cursory reading
of it.
" Confklering it as the work of a very young
lady, it certainly is entitled to applause. The
characters are greatly diverfified, and extremely
well supported. Several of them are to me ori
ginal. Mortimer Delville, and Cecilia,
are very amiable, and excellent personages
Mrs. Delvili.e, tho poilelled of manj' uncom
mon, and brilliant traits, is on the whole not a
: leafing character. Her husband I despise â
Even old Bricgs is by no means as di(agreeable.

The infuflferable haughdnefs, unlimited pride,
and full-blown conceit, which are so conspicuous
in " Don Pedigree," l ender him an object of
contempt and di'fguft. A parenr, whole whole
nappinefs conhlts in recounting the glory of an
cellors, who perhaps had fmatl claim to merit ;
and who is so deflitute of feeling as to force the
nearest, and molt important interests of his child,
to become subservient to his own pride and weak
ness, is a monster in exiltence. Perhaps there
is nothing more consonant to human imperfec
tion, than family pride : Certainly there is no
thing more opposed to the perfection of human
reason. To experience a degree of fatisfadtion
upon hearing the viitues of our progenitors ap
plauded, is rational and to please
ourselves with a descent from persons, whose on
ly merit was an ellate incapable of alienation ; or
to take pride in the dignity, and importance, of
a parent, or grandparent, whose career commenced
on the dunghillâis beneath the character of a
human being. Yet, notwithflanding t lie jultice
of these observations is acknowledged by every
person, how many are there, even of our acquaint
ance, who are ready, and disposed, to facrifice
the highest happiness of a beloved child, at the
(hrine of mammon ! Is it not aftonilhing, that
multitudes of people, who in most circumstances,
judge rightly of human life, when property is
concerned, will persuade themselves that no re
gard is due to the fined: and most exquifire feel
ings of the foul ; and that, even in the business
of marriage, a daughter, possessed of the moll re
fined and delicate ideas on the fobjeiS, ought
to force herfelf into the arms of an unfeeling
brute, whose only attractive charm is an ellate,
and whose conceptions never extended beyond
the limits of a well drawn purfe-llriug ?
" These observations I consider as applying ro
the charadler of Mr. Delville, in Cecilia. Alany
things, however, may befaid in palliation of fa
mily pride in an Englilhman. The English na
tion has long been in the habit of considering
wealth and merit as inseparable companionsâ
and it is certainly a happy circumrtance for
many, that worth is an hereditament; otberwife
their situation would be truly deplorable. Bun
in an American (and there are many Delvilles
in America) it is altogether without excuse. Ve
ry few families in this country can trace their
pedigree farther back than two degrees, without
(tumbling on an ancestor, whose itate and con
dition in life was at teajl humiliating. In fact
there is considerable danger that family pride,
in this country, will experience firft orlafl. a rood
fatal mortification. For who will fit and observe
the ebullitions of this species of pride and not
revert back, on the lift of anceftors,to find if the
firft of them who fettled on this fide the Atlantic,
were not fold for their paflage, or transplanted
for felony."

sachusetts, with a draw to admit a free pafTage for vefTels with fix
ed standing malls, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as (hall be determined mod con
venient for the navigation of the rirer, with piles or blocks on
each fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid vefTels in pafiing through. Also, one lamp on each fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during

The bridges aic to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as shall render them perfe&ly substantial and secure in
the opinion of the commiflioners, and are to be of a fufficient
height to proteffc them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
11812
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluftrades,

The following are the terms which the commiflSoners are au
thor i fed to offer to con traitors :
A Icafe of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the prc
fent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an estimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
a&ual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last past,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum. will corifequently produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per ana This may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated apot). The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter*
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftru&ion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the western fide of the Hudson, are all important
circumstances, which must neccflarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commilfioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads conne&ed
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places (hall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the contracts for eiefting them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contrail on thp
above principles, will be plcafed to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to William Maxwell,
Esq. in New-York, fpecifyirig the shortest period of lease for
which they will undertake to erc&thc said bridges,together with
proper security for performing the fame.
