[No. 16, of Vol. lII.]
FROM THE (BOSTON) COLUMBIAN CENTINEL
Mr. RUSSELL,
IN that part of Mr. Paine's pamphlet which
he has chofeii to call the milcellaneous chap
ter, he observes th t, " when a man in a long
" cause attempts 10 Iteer his course by any thing
" else than fomepolar truth or principle, he is Cure
"to be loft." I have fought for the polar prin
ciple to which his exertions were directed in
this publication, and 1 must acknowledge I have
fought in vain. His production ;s historical,
political, mifcellaneons, satirical and panegy
rical. It is an encomium upon the National
Aflembly of France. It is a commentary upon
the rights of men, inferring questionable deduc
tions from unquestionable principles. It is a se
vere satire upon Mr. Burke and his pamphlet,
upon the English government, upon Kings, up
on Nobility, and Aristocracy ; it is a narrative of
several occurrences, connected with the French
revolution, and it concludes with a kind of pro
phetical iinpulfe, in the expectation of an " Eu
ropean Congress to patronize the progress oj free go
vernment, and promote the civilization oj nations -with
each other." The objetfl which he promised to
himfelf, in this publication, is not so dubious as
the principle on which he wrote. His intention
appears evidently to be, to convince the people
of Great-Britain, that they have neither Liberty
nora Conftitntionâthat their only pofiible means
to procure these blefiings to themlelves, is to
" topple down headlong" their present govern
ment, and follow implicitly the example ot the
French. As to the right, he scruples not to fay,
" that which a whole nation clioofes to do, it
" has a right to do." This proportion is a
part of what Mr. Paine calls a fyftetn of prin
ciples in opposition to those of Mr. Burke, and
it is laid down without any fort of qualification.
It is not my intention to defend the principles
of Mr. Burkeâ¢âtruth is the only object of my
pursuit, and 1 fliall without helitation relule my
aflent to every principle inconsistent with that,
whether it proceeds from Mr. Burke, Mr. Paine,
or even from the illustrious National Atfembly of
Trance. This principle, that a whole nation has
a right to do whalfoever it pleases, cannot in
any l'enfe whatever be admitted as true. The
eternal and immutable laws of justice and of mo
rality, are paramount to all human legislation.
The violation of those laws is certainly within
the power, but it is not among the rights of na
tions. The power of a nation is the collected
power of all the individuals which compose it.
The rights of a nation are in like manner the
collected riphts of its individuals ; and it mull
follow si om thence, that the powers of a nation
are more extensive than its rights in the very
fame proportion with those of individuals. It
is somewhat remarkable that in speaking of the
exercise of the particular right offorining a con
stitution, Mr. Paine himfelf denies to a nation,
that omnipotence, which he had before so li
berally bellowed. For this fame nation, which
has a right to do whatever it pleases, has no
right to establish a government in hereditary fuc
cefiion.â It is of infinite consequence, that the dif
timftion between power and right fliould be fully
acknowledged, and admitted as one of the fun
damental principles of Legiflatoi s. A whole na
tion such as France, England, or America, can atft
only by representation ; and the a<ftÂ» of the re
presentative body must be confldered as the atfts
of the nation. We must go farther, and fay
that the ads of the majority in the Representa
tive Aflembly are the a<fts of the whole body, and
confequer.tly of the whole nation. If therefore,
a majority thns constituted, are bound by no
law human or divine, and have no other t ule but
their sovereign will and pleasure, to direct them ;
what pofiible security can any citizen of the na
tion have for the protection of his unalienable
rights ? The principles of liberty must still be
the sport of arbitrary power, and the hideous
form of despotism, must lay aside the diadem
and the sceptre, only to afl'ume the party-co
loured garments of democracy.
The f'yftem of principles upon which Mr.
Pai/ie advances this aflertion is intended to prove
that the Englilh nation have a light to destroy
their present form of government, and to ere<ft
another. lam not disposed to deny this right,
nor is it at present necefl'ary to examine whe
ther Mr. Burke's opinions upon this ftibjeft, are
not directed rather against the expediency than
the abftratled rights of such a mrafure. It may,
Wednesday, June 22, 1 791.
however, not be improper to trace the origin of
Mr. Paint's arguments against the principles
maintained by Mr. Burke. Doctor Frice had as
ferted, chat " by the principles of the revolu
" tion, in 1688, the people of England had ac
" quired the right, I. To chufe their own go
" vernours. 2. To cashier them for mifcondudt ;
' and 3. To frame a government for themselves."
Mr. Burke endeavors to prove that the princi
ples of the revolution in 1688, so far from war
ranting any right of this kind, fupporc a doc
trine alinoli diametrically opposite. Mr. Paine,
in reply, cuts the gordian knot at once, declares
the parliament of 1688 to have been down-right
usurpers, censures them for having unwisely
sent to Holland for a King, denies the existence
of a Britifli Constitution, and invites the people
of England, to overturn their present govern
ment, and to erect another upon the " broad
" basis of national sovereignty, and government
" by reprel'entation."âAs Mr, Paine has depart
ed altogether from the principles of the revolu
tion, and has torn up by the roots, allreafoning
from the Britifti Constitution, by the denial of
its exigence, it becomes neceflary to examine his
work upon the grounds which he has chosen tc
aflume. If we judge of the production from iti
apparent tendency, we may call it, an addrels tc
the Englifli Nation, attempting to prove that
they have a right to form a new constitution ;
that it is expedient for them immediately to ex
ercise that right, and that in the formation ol
this constitution, they can do no better than tc
imitate the model fei before them by the Frenc)
National Ajfenibly. However inimethodical hi;
production is, 1 believe, the whole of its argu
meniative part, may be referred to these thre<
points. If the fubjeut were to afFetft only the
Brjtifo Nation, we might leave them to reafoi
and a<S for themselves ; but, fir, these are con
cerns equally important to all mankind ; am
the citizens of America are called upon, fron
high authority to rally round the jlandard ofthi:
champion of revolutions. I lhall therefore now
proceed to examine the reasons upon which hi
founds his opinions relative to each of tliefi
points.â
The people of England have in common with
every other nation, a natural and unalienable
right to form a constitution of government, not
because a whole nation has a right to do what
ever ic chooses to do, but because government
being instituted for the common security of the
natural rights of every individual, it mult be
li-.ible to alterations whenever it becomes incom
petent for that purpose. The right of a people
tolegiflate for i'ucceedinggenerations derives all
its authority from the consent of that posterity
who at e bound by their laws, and therefore the
expressions of perpetuity used by the Parliament
of 1688, contain no absurdityâand expressions
of a similar nature may be found, in all the con
fliiutions of the United Statej.
Bur, fir, when this right is thus admitted in
its fullelt latitude, it ni.uft also be admitted that
it ought never to be exercised, but in cases of
extreme urgency : Every nation has a right as
unquelHonable to diflolve the bands of civil so
ciety, by which they are united, and to return
to that state of individual imbecility in which
man is supposed to have existed, previous to the
formation of the social compatft. The people of
America have been compelled by an unaccounta
ble neceflity, diftrefling in its operation, but glo
rious in its consequences, to exercise this right,
and whenever a nation has no other alternative
but the degradation of slavery, or the formida
ble conflict of a revolution, the generous spirit
of freedom will not hesitate a moment ill the
choice ; whether the people of prance were at
the period of their revolution, reduced to that
unhappy situation, which rendered it absolutely
neceflary to overthrow their whole system to its
foundations, is a question, upon which the ablest
patriots among themselves have differed, and up
on which weaie inadequate to decide. Whether
the people of England are now in that calami
tous predicament, iÂ» a question, more proper for
our difcuffioii, and upon which I shall take the
liberty to examine the reasoning of Mr. Paine.

FROM THE QUEBEC HERALD.
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING CHEESE
TO farmers who live in the country and keep
many cows, it would doubtless be an ad
vantage to know how to make their milk into
good cheese ; for through the want of that
knowledge the dairy women are often at as
much pains to spoil their milk by making it in
to very bad cheese, as they would then be to
make it into that which is very good.
Much depends upon having a portion of fait
petre used with common fait in ialting the
cheese :âlf the latter is only used, and a quan
tity fufficient to keep the cheese sweet is put in,
the cheese is apt to be very hard, and to have a
biting disagreeable taste ; but if not so much
is taken, then, wheri the cheese is drying a pu
trid fermentation conies on, and the cheese swells
up much in the middle, often till it is twice as
thick as it was before. If the cheese fhotild now
be cut it would be found to fend forth a disa
greeable stench, and conld not be eaten ; but if
fuffeied to stand, the fermentation gradually a
bates, and the cheese falls even lower than it
was at firft, so as to be concave on both fides :
By age such cheeses grow much sweeter than
they were when fermenting, yet always retain
something of the faine disagreeable strong taste.
Cheeses that are not salted enough, will be more
or less, according to the above defcriptioii,, in
proportion as they lack more or less of being
salted enough ; fa that whenever the dairy wo
man perceives the above appearance in her
cheeses, flie may know that it is time for her to
alter her hand in salting. The people of En
gland have perhaps as many different ways of
making cheese as there are different counties in
England ; which is fufficient to (hew that cheese
may be good, and yet differ in some refpedts as
to the way of its being made ; for the bett of
cheeses are made in divers parts of England ;
yet whatever particulars they differ in, they
doubtleft agree in adopting the usd of falt-petre,
though perhaps not in the fame proportion j for
it is well known that cheeses from different parts
vary in quality, and yet are all very good.
Cheeses made accordiug to the following re
cipe have by long experience been found to be
of a very excellent quality, and perhaps inferior
to none that are made in England :
* Let the runnet be prepared by soaking the calye's big in cold
water, and faking it enough to keep it sweet; to the milk, firft
made blood warm, add enough of this to turn the milk into a
curd in half an hour, which quanti y will soon be found by ex
perience ; then heat it as hot as you can well bear your hand in
it, and having ftraincd the whey well from it, break or chop the
curd to pieces, and to every five pounds of cheese put a tea-fpoon
full of falt-petre, and a large table fpoonfull of common fait; (it
will soon be learned by experience how much milk or curd will
produce five pounds of cheese) it must now be put in the press and
turned within an hour ; kept in the press two daysâturn it twicc
the firftday, and once the last.
They ftiouid while drying, keep it in a dark room, or other
ways keep it from flics.
If any cracks come in them when drying, let them be filled
with a paste made of butter and flour to keep the flies from com
ing at them, if any should get into the room.

TO prevent the fatal effects of drinking cold
Water, or cold Liquors of any kind in warm
weather.
ift. Avoid drinking while you are warm, or,
2clly. Drink only a small quantity at once,and
let it remain a short time in your mouth before
you swallow it ; or
3dly. Grasp the vessel out of which you are
about to drink (provided it is made of glass,
earthen ware, or metal) for a few minutes, with
both your hands, for each of these substances
convey off a portion of the heat of the body into
the cold liquor, and thereby leflen the danger
which arises from the excelfive heat of the body,
on the one hand, and the coldness of the liquor,
on the other ; or,
4thly. Wash your hands and face, and rinse
your mouth with cold water before you drink.
If these precautions have been negletted, and
the disorder incident to drinking cold water
hath been produced, the firft, and in molt in
itances, the only remedy to be administered is,
sixty drops of liquid laudanum, in spirit and wa
ter, or warm drink of any kind.
If this ftould fail of giving relief, the fame
quantity may be given 20 minutes afterwards.
When laudanum cannot be obtained, rum and
water, or warm waterfhould be given. Vomits
and bleeding (hould not be used without con
sulting a physician.PHILADELPHIA CARPET MANUFAC TOR i .
AMONGST the many accounts of the Hou
rilhing Hate of the infant manufactures ot
America, it seems ftrai.ge that the Carpet Manu
factory has been hitherto so little notified A
correspondent who has lately visited that elta
blifhment in the Northern Liberties, informs us,
that he has seen fomeofthe carpets manufactur
ed there by William Peter Sprague of those du
rable kind called Turkey and Axmmfltr, which (el
at 20 per cent, cheaper that those imported, and
nearly as low as Wilton carpeting, but of double
itsdurability. . , , .
The carpet made for the Prefulent, and others
for various perfbns, are master-pieces of then
kind, particularly that for the Senate chamber
ofthe United States. The device wove .ft the
Jaft mentioned, is the Crest and Armor tat Alchtnf-,
tnents appertaining to the Untied Stat/'. hir
teen Stars forming a conftellatioli diverging from
a cloud, occupy the space under the chair ofthe
Vice-Prefident. The American Eagle is dil
played in the centre, holding in his dexter ta
lon an olive branch, in his Snifter a bundle of
thirreen arrows, and in his beak, afcroll infcnb
ed with the motto, E pluribus unttm. The whole
surrounded by a chain formed of thirteen shields,
emblematic of each Stare.
The fides are ornamented with marine and
land trophies, and the corners exhibit very beau
tiful Cornn Copias, some filled with oli v e branch
es and flowers exprelfive of peace, whilst others
bear fruit and grain, the emblems of plenty.
Under the arms, on the pole which supports
the cap of liberty, is hurg the balance of JuJiice.
The whole being executed in a capital fttle,
with rich bright colours, has a very fine efFecft,
notwithstanding the raw materials employed,are
ofthe refufe and coarser kind ; so that this ma
nufatftory is an advantage to others by allowing
n price for those articles which could not be u(ed
in the common branches of woolen and tow bu
finefs.
Manufactures of all kinds will generally mee:
with the support of the friends of the country,
and this in particular, which already gives em
ployment to a number of poor women and chil
dren, will no doubt be encouraged. The article
of carpeting is now imported in considerable
quantities, for which, large funis are annually
exported to Europe ; but if due encouragement
be afforded, there is every reason to believe that
it may become an objeCt of exportation.

jnoft grateful acknowltogment for that goodness, allow me toob
ferve that your own determination, co-operating with that of your
fellow-citizens throughout the union, to maintain and perpetuate
ttre federal government, affords a better assurance of order and ef
fective government with their concomitants private and public
prosperity, than the best meant endeavorsof any individual couk
give. Oor national glory, and our domestic tranquility, can ne
ver be tarniOied or d.fturlied, while they are guarded by wife laws
founded in public virtue. Anions the measures which an enligh -
ened and patriotic legislature will pursue to pr< serve them, I doubt
not the means of diffufing ufelul information will be duly consi
dered. My best wishes for the prosperity of your village, and for
your individual happiness, are fincerelv offered.

M. de TfRNANi, an officer of distinguished
merit, who served in America the last war, it is
said, is appointed minister plenipotentiary from
the Court of France to the United States, and may
be expected here in a few weeks.
The Hon. Thomas Jefferson', Secretary of
State, arrived in town on Sunday lalt, from a
tour to the Eastward.
By an arrival at New.York accounts are re
ceived from Europe to the sd May ; They state
that the victorious army of the Einprefs of Raf
fia is within a few days march of Conftaritinople.
There has been a strong rumour of peace ; in
consequence of which the British funds got up
but the general tenor of the speculations on the
fubje.fl abate that idea, and speak confidently of
â war with Russia. The Spanilh navy is said to
bt in the highest order, and they are getting
their gallies readyâthe Englilh fay,to affilt them

Porte. The head of the late Grand Vizir was,
on the 19th of February, ftnek upon a pole and

The Royalists of Paris, the Eriglilh fay, la
ment the death of Mirabeau ; if there is any
truth in rhis, it is at lead enigmatical.- The
King of France, who intended to pais Kaftei
at St. Cloud, was ftopt in his carriage as he was
setting out, by the populace, and forced to re
turnâ Upon this he wrote a letter to tlie National
Aflembly, requcfling admittance to the h<;ule,
which being granted, he delivered a speech,
which was replied to in an affectionate Inanner,
by the Prcfident. It was laid the King had port
potted his intend'ed journey to St. Cloud, altlio
lie perfilled in liis speech in going thereâlt is
further said he has difmiflecl leveral persons a

M. de la Fayette has adiually resigned, and it
was feared other resignations would take place
in consequence. Still all was peace and ttan
quiiity at Paris when thelaft accounts arrived.
Other accounts, hy the fame channel, further
inform That the Ruffian cabinet wifliing
to be allured of the disposition of Spain at the
present jundlure, sent a courier extraordinary to
Madrid for that purpose ; the answer from Spain
was fatisfatflory, and attended with proniifeS of
every good office in favor of Rulfia ; that four
teen millions of piasters in gold and silver are ex
pected by Spain, to arrive from Mexico and Peru
TYiat the Turk* are making vigorous pieparations
for a fourth campaign ; the talk ot a (eparate
peace between Russia and the Porte still continues
âthe private bagjgage of the King of Prussia is
sent off to his armyâthe duke of York was on
the point of letting out for the continent to join
the Prussian forces ; that infurretflions have ta
ken place in Macedonia and Epirus, the inhab
itants endeavoring to throw off the Turkish
yoke; that the last divifior. of theTurkiih fleet con

chosen Count Montmorency, an avowed enemy
to the present constitution, to be his confeflbr.
M. de la Fayette continues inflexible as to his
refignationâtho' fifty-four, out of the sixty bat
talions of the national guards have urged him
to resume the command. Great disturbances
have taken place in the country of Avignon.â
The Danifli East-India company like all others
011 the continent has failed.
The newspapers have given accounts of a
league of German Princes that made certain re
presentations to the National Aflembly to obtain
a modification of some decrees which, they com
plained, infringed on their rights. Commission
ers we now hear from undoubted authority were
appointed by the National Aflembly to confer
with thelpGerman Princes, and amicably fettle
their claims. The cominiilioners have been fuc
cefsful in their negociations, and fulfilled the
object of their appointment. The Princes on
certain stipulated terms have agreed to give up
their claims. Mr. de Ternant, the gentleman
who is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary from
the Court of France to the United States, was

Knowledge or education i 3 to the mind,;what
the natural fun is to the worldâit enlightens,
improves, and expands the human foul. If edu
cation then may be juflly compared to that glo
rious luminary who iheds his benignant influen
ces on all, what a forcible idea is iinprell'ed on
the contemplative benevolent bol'om, of the jus
tice, and indispensable neeeffity and importance
of diffufing the rays of initru&ion and know
ledge on all the members of the community.
The gospel is preached to all, and whosoever
will may come and partake of the bleflingâbut
may not this .be jultly compared to building with
out laying a pioper foundation ? If the basis of
a good conflitution of body is laid in infancy,
how much more reqnifite is it that the founda
tion of virtue (hould be laid by an early educa
tion. Learning, like liberty, should be the na
tural inheritance of our children, whether rich
or poor. This can only be the cafe to a compe
tent degree, by ordaining that schools and in
ftrudtors fliall be appointed fufficient to inftruit
all, and paid out of the treasury of the corpora
tion. The town of Providence, in the State of
Rhode Island, has lately set an example which is
worthy of the imitation of every community,
whether large or small, viz.
" That a fufficient number of fchoolm fters, to
inftrudt alt the children in town, ftiould be appoint
ed, and that their salaries should be paid out of
the town treasury; a pi opofition that receiv
ed an almost unanimous approbationâand a num
ber of the nioft opulent gentlemen who will pay
largely to the support of this eflabliftiment,have
interested themselves warmly in its favor."
Can any thing reflect higher honor on the hu
man character, than such benevolence and ge
nuine patriotism ?

THE King having taken information 011 the arret pronounced

of whale oil and fpermacxti, the produce of foreign fifheries, into
the kingdom, observing that oil made from sea calves and other
fifh, and sea animals, not being comprehended in the said airet, a
fraudulent importation of whale oil might take place under the
name of the aforefaid oils; and that on the other hand it might be
inferred from the tenor ot the said arret, that oils th. prorluce of
the fifheries of United States were prohibited : And his Majesty
wifhingto remove every doubt 011 this head, to provide therefore

from filh and other sea animals, produced from foreign fifheries,
as well as whale-bone produced in like manner from the said fo
reign fifheries, sHall be prohibited from importation into the king
dom, without permitting the said prohibition nevertheless to ex
tend either to the said kinds of oils, or to the said whale oils and
fpermacacti, or the whale-bone produced from the fifheries of the
United States of America, and imported directly into France in
French vefTels, or those belonging to the fubji Â£ts of the said United

of the fifheries carried on by the citizens of the United States;
which certificates fhaii be presented to the Officers of the Admi

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with thetowa
and harbour of New-Haven; to those who are not, fuffice it tt> fay,
that its beautiful situation is not furpafled, if equalled by any ; be
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be fÂ«jid
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the lound
but by realon of the flats, this wharf is netefiarily extended to the
channel, where ships can load and unload ; and when corftplcat
ed, will be the moll extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3>4thk of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the. States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all clafTes of people, for
thcfuccefsof this enterprise, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet published in
Ameriea) induce the managers to believe the tickets w ill meet with
a fpecdy sale.
The drawing will pofuivcly commence at the State-House, in
>Jew-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner ? if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be published, and the prizes
paid on demand, by the managers. Those prizes not called for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
for the ufc of the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.
