Iliad, lib. 2, v. 205.
" T SEE 110 good in having several Lords ; let
X one alone be mailer ; let one alone be King."
This was laid by Ulyfles in Homer, in a public
fpeecli. If lie had only said I fee no good in
having several Lords, this would have been said
with perfecfl propriety. To have spoken with
reason he Ihould have said, that the domination
of several cannot be good, because the power of
one alone, as soon as he takes che title of Maf
fter, is hard and unreasonable. But he had gone
quite to the contrary fide and said let one alone
be Master ; let one alone be King.
Perhaps it is neceflary to excuse Uly(Tes,to whom
at that time, it might be neceflary to make use
of chat Vanguage, to compose a itiutiny in the ar--
my, conforming his words, as I believe more to
the times than to truth. But to speak in good
cotifcience, it is an extreme misfortune to be
subject to a Master, who, we can never be sure
â¢will be good, since it is always in his power
to be bad when he will. And to have several maf
flers, is as much as to be so many times extreme
ly unfortunate. It is not liiy delign to debate, at
present, the question so much agitated, whether
the other fafhldns of republics are better than
monarchy. Before I should discuss the question
what rank monarchy ought to hold among re
publics, I iliould enquire whether it has any ; for
it is not easy to believe, that there is any thing of
a public in a government, where all is in one.
But this question is reserved for another occa
frnn ; and will require a treatise by itfelfâor ra
ther it will draw after it, the whole train of po
litical disputes.
At present I wifft only to whether it is
poflible, and liow it Js ffoTÃLlcTtTiut so many men,
so many cities, so many nations endure the ty
ranny of one, who had no power butjfuch as they'
give him, who is incapable ot hurting them, any
longer than they pleal'e to endure him, who can
do them no evil, uiilcl's they choose to fuffer it,
rather than contradict him. A great thing cer
tainly, and yet so common, that it is the more
to be regretted, to fee a million of millions of
men, serving mifbrably with their necks under
the yoke, not conitrained by any greater force,
than rhc-if own, hut enchanted and charmed by
the mere n3ij>e of one, whose power they ought
not to fear because he il single, vVhofe qualities
they ought not to love, because he is to them in
human and savage. Such is the weakness among
us men, we must often submit to force : it is lie
cefiary that we temporize ; We cannot always be
i|e strongest. If, thereforea nation is coafhain
ed by force of arms, to serve one, as the city of
Athens the thirty tyrants, it Ihould not refufe to
serve, but complain of the accident ; or rather
neither refufe nor complnhi, but bear the evil
with patience, and reserve i(felf for better for
tune in future. Such isoor nature that the com
mon duties of friendfhip, consume a great part
ofjhe course of our lives. It is reasonable to
love virtue, to efleetn fair atftions, to acknow
ledge benefits where they have been received,
and often to diminish our own ease, to increaf'e
the honor and advantage of him whom we love,
and who deserves well of us. Thus therefore if
the inhabitants of a country have found some
great perfon:ige, who has (hown them by expe
rience a great forefight, in watching over them,
great courage in defending them, great caution
in governing them : If from tbefe confederations
they grow familiar and traceable in obedience
to him, and confide in him so far, as to give him
certain advantages, I know not whether it would
he wisdom, to take him out of thofc circuui
ftances in v\hich he did good, to advance him in
to others \<'here he might do evil. Certainly it
wuft be called goodness of heart, nor to fear t-vil
frot:i him, of whom we have received nothing
hnt good. But, good God ! What can this be ?
What name can we give it ? What misfortune ?
What vice ? What iniferable vice ? To fee a
multitude, an infinite number, not obey, but serve;
not be governed Win tyrannized, having neither
property, relations, children, nor even their lives
w hich thev can call their own

And oft the mad will virtue (hojv ;

Yet, without judgment to condr ft these powers,
Vainly you (trew rhetoric flowers,
And all the world aftonilh with your sense :
Then, kindly, from your thrones sublime,

And mark, the impoitant rules which I dispense.

THE various bounties granted by our legifla
rure for the encouragement of the farmers
in raising Sheep, has greatly increased that ufe
ful animal ; yet much remains to be done, to
bring this business to the utmost state of perfec
tion which this article will admit of. Not only
the increase ot ?iumbers (hou]& be attended to; but
! the quality of the wool also is an eflential objetft.
| A short treatise on this fwbjeCt is much wanted â
j pointing out the belt mode of managing Sheep,
so as to procure the greatest increase of their
numbers; how to prevent thedillem pers to which
they will be inoft liable in this climate ; what
food is molt f'uitable for winter ancFfpring feed
ing ; how to prevent their shedding their wool
before the proper season of fheafingâand how
to procure the fin eft fleeces, suitable for making
! fuperfiire cloths. The making "wool one of the
f>aple articles of this Hate, I consider as an objeCt
which Ihould not be loft fight of for a moment. â
No man who is a descendant of Britain, and who
reflects a moment on the causes which have con
tributed to raise that nation totheir envied great
ness, can hesitate to pronounce it to be their at
tention to manufacturesâof which, that of woo l
holds the firft place. Thofc politicians who de
ride the idea of ConneClicnt's becoming a manu

friends to the (lateâor as wife aittl ufeful ltatef

Great-Bi itoin and Ireland might as well de
pend 011 hu(bandry as we ; nay better, for Uley
are in potlefiion of a finer country âtheir lauds
produpeih better crops, and ihey have less win
cer to intercept a constant course of labor in the
field, and fucceflion of crops. Yet had Britain
depended fiinply on her hulbandry, (he would
this day have been ranked among the most infer
ior nations ; indeed (he had not maintained lieij
independence in the midli of such powerful
neighbors.
But our farmers ihould not confine their atten
tion to railing wool all parts of the ftaie are
not equally well calculated for that purpose
Hemp and Flax merit their attention, and should
be lifted amongst their yearly crops. The pre
paring those articles for market, would furnifli
labor tor the winter mouths, when so many of
our farmers, who have not large crops of grain,
are idle. Large funis of money are sent out of
this state every year, for hempâwhich is now
imported, at a heavy expence, from the Baltic.
t 1 lax is wanted alio for riggingâbut iminenfe
quantities are deatanded tor (be. iup.ply: of the
Duck IVlanufadures, over and above the constant
demand for coarse linens.
A short treatise on thebeft method of cultivat
ing those two articles, and preparing them for
market, is much wanted : Anyone who can fur
nifli such a desirable piece of inftrucftion, adapt
ed to the most common capacity, would better
deserve a Docftorate than most of those who now
so cheaply obtain them.
There have been federal experiments made,
about Norwich, in raising lien>p, which are said
to have proved fuccefsful : It is much to be wifli
ed a more general spirit of adventure and expe
riment were observable amongst our farmersâ
and that ihey did nor content themselves with
barely doing what their fathers have done before
them.
Some experiments have been made at New-Ha
ven in the cultivating of Klax, so as to produce
that article iir grearenjbnndan** aiulpeife&ion.
1 hope those gentleman whd have fetn the great
benefit of their new mode of culture, will have
pu&lic spirit enough to publish the result of their
experiments, for the purpose of introducing a
more general attention to, and adoption of, their
improvements.
EXTRACT.
MEN fliould never be in hafle to conclude thac
any enquiry is impracticable, merely be
cause there appears no relation between the pre
sent means, and the fact to be ascertained ; for
have all the combinations of these means been
tried ? If not, who can be certain, that he is ac
quainted with all the relations between these
means and the faift, which is to exist,
and proposed to be ascertained'? This reflection
is strengthened by numberlefe inilances, record
ed in every page of the hiiiory of natural philo
sophy, and more especially of philiology. Con
sider how many inventions, for which the an
cients would scarce have ditVed to hope, even if
they had had a distant glimpse of them, have en
riched these f'ciences ! Could they have imagined
that the artificial foundation of the germs of va
rious animals would one day be acconvplifhed,
aud that chickens would b6 hatched without the
aid of animal heat, orof a stove ? Need I men
tion tbofe admirable chirurgical operations, the
miracles of the healing art, which are scarce cre
dible even to those who behold them i We are
as yet incompetent judges of what is impoffiblo
in philosophy ; for we always decide from our
present acquisitions of knowledge, which bear no
proportion to nature. Nature is immense ; the
poifible combinations of beings have 110 bounds,
and the human understanding is always too baity
in its decisions. The conviction of our ignor
ance or moderate attainments, ought to preserve
us from despairing of any thing in physics ; we
(hould fay to ourfetves, What I cannot discover,
another will lay ojieit to every eye.
SHEARING OK SHEEP.
THE following method has been found effcduaf. Immedi
ately after the iheep Â«Â»re fliorn, soak the roots of rh* wool that re
mains all over with oil, or butter, and bnmftone,afid three or four
days afterwards wash them with fait and water, and the wool ot
next season will be not only much finer and fofter, but the quan
ity will be greatly enlarged, and it may be depended on, that tho
flicep will neither be troubled with the scab or vermin that year.

MR. TEN NO,
COME folks do indeed think it strange, that the article of the
O charter of the Bank of the United States, which excludes fo
reigners from voting in the direction of the Bank, is one of those
â¢which receives the fulled approbation among the mod intelligent
characters on the other fide of the water, since it implies nothing
Jess than that they are very well pleased at the profpeft of poffVflLig
the very brilliant advantage of placing their money in the Bank
without any controul in the direction of it. Really, Mr. Fen no,
this is puffing with a vengeance ; and more probable stories must
be told us to gain at lead the credit of ingenuity in the narrator :
The fact is, that the more this article is considered by foreigners
or natives, the more exceptionable it must appear to both : To fo
foreigners it is the denial of a positive right of managing their own
monied tranfaÂ£tions as they please ; but to the natives it is much
â¢worseâit is the narrowing of the rights of ele&ton in the Bankâ
and by imposing a kind of torpor on - all foreign Hock, giving to
the domestic part that is entitled to vote, an exceflive, an undue
preponderanceâthereby placing the ele&ions in the hands ofa few,
instead o i placing it where it mull be surely fafeft in the hands of all.
Pray Mr. Fenuo, ftippofe the whole 25000 (hares (hould be puicha
ied, as they certainly may be in process of time, by these very in
telligent characters on the other fide of the water, how are then
the Bank Directors to be chosen, when there are no domestic voters
to elect '.hem. Indeed Mr. Fenno, if your intelligence be well
founaed, it is ferioully alarmingâfor the more these transatlantic
gentlemen purchase of dock, the more must it place the Bank at
ihe mercy ot the winds and waves of political fa&ioninthis coun
try, without that common intcrcjl in its defence, so essential to its
lately -without that ballast ot general representation, which by
competition at elections, could alone keep the (hip steady in her
motions. r 1
Th ax foreigners interejled in Â«ur funds should be pleased with the
euablifhment of a Bank, said to have the magic power of transmut
ing their paper Â«nto gold i j not surprising, considering their very
natural eager ness to lee such an operation t ke place â that they
lhould approve of our present excellent system of federal govern
ment, which has conferred such advantages on our country, and
bids fair to elevate her to the highest pinnacle of national p'rofper-
Uy-.neither is this surprising ; for what man. possessed of the
imalleft spark of general philanthropy for the human race, would
not rejoice at the present eminently prosperous position of this our
dear asylum for the wretched and unfortunate of every nation ;
ut .hat foreigners fhoulcf approve the proposal of receiving their
money into th<* without allowing them any (hare in the
ekction Â°f pmdent Directors to condutt itâthis will appear in
deed still ftrangeto lome folks, who have observed how natural it
is for aH men to wish to have at least forne thing to fay in the ma
nagrment of what is their own.

f T'HÂ£ Stares of Brabant, extremely diflatisfied
J- with the condutft of the Emperor's Minister

following is an extradt :
" We earnestly entreat your Excellency not
tomiftak e for the voice of the people of the Provinces,

who are become famous for the excefles which
they have committed fincethe restoration of the
ancient government, and who, escorted by sol
diers, insult and beat with impunity all those
who are friends to the privileges of the country;
who, on the ajih ot January last, beat and wound

town of Antwerp ; who on Sunday lall wanton
attacked with drawn iabres, several people at
the gate of Louvain, who the very last evening
mortally wounded fevera-1 of the Compte de Du

Mr. Townfend, in his " Travels Into Spain,"
speaking of tht liifh Students that are received
into the CJniverfiry of Salamanca, with his usual
good sense and acutenefs of remark, observes,
" It is much to be lamented that they should be
reduced to the neceifity of seeking that protetfti
on in a foreign country, to which they are enti
tled in their own. This kind of persecution is
neither just nor politic. It is certain that igno
rance and bigotry have a strong connection.
Would you overcome inveterate prejudices, and
are you anxious to baui/h fuperftirion ? Let in
the light. Would you conciliate the affections
>i thole who differ from you in their religious
creed? No longer persecute ; cmbrace them,and
from enemies they will become your friends.
Let in the light, and difference of opinion dies
away. Catholics, in the more enlightened coun
tries, are no longer Papists. Their whole whole
fyftein is going to decay ; and without claiming
more than common fagaciry, we may venture to
foretel, that in pioportion as the limits of tole
ration shall be extended, all that cannot bear the
light will gradually vanilh, until the diftincftton
between Catholics and Protestants shall cease."
ella.
The mode, adds Mr. Townfend, of giving
letSurea iÂ» the Univerfiry of .Salamanca, is per
haps peculiar to itfelf, but worthy to be follow
ed iu our Universities. The Students havequef
tions proposed for iheir difculfion twice every
day, and on these they are informed what books
they are to read. Then, supposing the matter
to admit of a dispute, it is carried on by two of
them, under the direction of a moderator, who
gives alfiftance when it is wanted, and guides
them to the truth."

The bridges are to be conftrufcted on the principles of those eras
ed over Charles, Myftick, and Beverly Rivers in the State of Maf
rachufetts, with a draw to admit a free paflage for vellels with fix
d standing masts, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ved in that part of the bridges as (hall be determined most con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks on
'â ach fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid veffelsin palling through. Also, one lamp on each fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during
the continuance of the lease.
The bridge# ate to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, <5 (hall render them peife&ly substantial and secure in
the opinion of the commiflioners, and are to be of a futficient
height to protefl them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for carnage way, 20 feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on eaÂ«h fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet.
for balluftrades, 1 foot each, 2 feet.
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong ballultrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Boiton and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept -n constant repair, and at
he expiration of the leafc arc to be furrendcred in good order,
agreeably to the aÂ£t.
The following are the terms which the commiflioners are au
thorised to offer to contractors :
A lease of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a period not
r x.cc ding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the pre
sent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an eft : mate as could poflibly be obtained, the
attual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last past,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Terfey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will corifequently produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per ann. This mav fairly be
ftimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the 'ncreafing in rr
courle between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftru&ion of these bridges will give 10 travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the western fide of the Hydfon, are all important
circumstances, which must neceflarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper toads connected
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places (hall be determined 011 where the biidgei
are to be fixed, and ihe contra&s for eie&mg them are ex cutcd,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contrast on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to Willi am Maxwell,
Esq. in New-York, fpecifymg the (horteft period of lease f r
which they will undertake to ere&the said bridges,together with,
proper security for performing the fame.

S I R,
PERMIT ir.e through you to lay before the Agricultural So
ciety, the relult of the following little experiment, io lai as I
have as yet been able :o afccrtain it.
Laic 10 ihc idwuth of Apnl last, I had a picce of ground in
the vicinity of the borough of Lam. after, prepared to be sown
with oats, which I supposed would iiave taken fix teen buftiels of
feed. The evcuing before it was to be sown, I had eight bushels 3
put into a trough, and covered with water. The next morning
the water was drawn off, and the oats laid >11 a heap to dram, for
a lhort time, fay half an hour ; then Plailter of Paris in powder
was thrown on, by small quantities at a time, and mixed with
the Oats, till they acquired a lufficient decree of dryntfs to bJ
sown evenly ; in this process one bushel of the Plaillcr was conl
fumed ; the feed thus prepared, and dry feed from the fame 01W
heap were sown on alternate lands throughout the ficldf
The whole came up together, and in due time, and no difference,
was visible for seven or eight days. From that time forward the
diftinttion became very evident ; the Oais on the lands sown ,
with the prepared feed were much more luxuriant and of a deeper
green, until they began to ripenâOn the second inflant they were
cut, being then perfe&ly ripe, while those 011 the lands sown
with the unprepared feed were yet green, the heads much smaller,
and proinifing in everv refpc& a worse crop.
On the eighth I left home. They were then unfit to cur, and
appeared as if they would not be ripe for five or fix days afterâ
To the facts above stated, many of my neighbors are witness.
I mean to have the Oats, produced from the prepared and un
prepared feeds, threshed separately, to ascertain with precision
the difference in the quantity and quality of the produce, which
lhall be communicated to the society, as soon as conveniently
may be.
I have the honor to be,
SIR,
To Samuel Powel, Esq. Prrftdent
ojthe Agricultural Sucicty.
S I R,
IN August last, if I recollect right, I troubled you to commu
nicate to the Agricultural Society the result of an experiment I
niaoe, the preceding April, by preparing feed Oats with Plaifter
of Paris, so far as the fame could then be ascertained : Having
since determined the difference of the produce from the prepared
and unprepared feeds, I beg leave to lay it before the societyâ
The produce of the eight bushels of prepared feed was one hun
dred and twenty-two bushels and about a peck ; of the like quan
tity of unprepared feed ninety-fix bushels, the former yielding an
iucreaie of fifteen and a quarter for one, or thirty and a half bush
els to the acre ; the latter only twelve for one or twenty-four bush
els to the acie. The produce of the prepaied feed weighed thirty
three and a half pounds the bushel, that of the unprepared only
thirty-two and a quarter poundsâso that for about five shillings,
the ex pence of a bushel of Plaifter of Paris, I gained tweuty-fix
bushels of Oats, and by allowing for the increased weight, one
and a quarter lb. on one hundrca and twenty-two bushels, I may
fairly add tour and a half bushels more, making in the whole
thirty and a half bushels.
I am, Sir, with much refpeft,
Your obedient humble fcrvant,

IT is the duty of every individual, by every mean in his power,
to promote the ufeful arts in his country. Considerable ad
vances having been made in procuring Sugar, from the Sugar-Ma
ple on the Wcftern Frontiers, it is thought, a method invented bv
Joseph El licott, near this place, (the boiling water in wood)
may be singularly ufctul, both for cheapness and expedition, to
the sugar-boilers. There have been many attempts made to boil
water, by means of flues pafling through the body of water con
fined in a wooden vessel, but the one alluded to is the fir ft that has
iucceeded. The only difficulty seems to be in the formation of
the worm or flue : The common method has been, to make tbar
end of the tlue that takes the fire in from the oven, larger than the
one that delivers the smoke : When the flue is made in this man
ner, change the ends, and it will be found to answerâthe small
end to take in the fire, and the large end to deliver the smokeâ
by this mean one or two thousand gallons of water may be boiled,
at a (rifling cxpence, in one vessel. This will be found an ufeful
hint to the Mannfatturcrs of Steam,

" I had the pleasure of addressing you so long

France, containing the propositions of which he
was direÂ»fted by the committee of afleflment, (of
which he was the reporter) to make to that Afl'cm
blyfor the new regulations of the tobacco trade.
Since then this subject has often occupied the
public attention of that aflembly ; the farmers
general and their friends were anxious to pre
serve the monopoly, and used all the powerful
intered they pofleiied to accomplifli it. On the
other hand, the commerce of France, and the
warmest friends of the revolution, struggled for
the freedom of the trade; at lad, this party has
carried it, and within these fourteen days the
National Aflembly have palled, after long de
bates, the annexed five articles of a decree upon
that subject. There remains it is said, only one
more article to discuss, which regards the fabri
cation and sale in the kingdom.
Not knowing whether my partners at Havre
may have had an opportunity of communicating
this intelligence to you, 1 take the earliest op

importance to the general commerce of tobacco.
