fÃOti THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER
No. IV.
VINDICATION OF Mr. JEFFEIISON.
Continued from the Gazette of the\sh ult..
A DISREGARD for the public cre
dit, or to life terms more corres
pondent with the idea of the writer,
a desire to extirpate it, is the remain
ing article, in the 1 ilt of charges
which have been brought forwatn oy
tiie American againll Mr. Jefferfon.
In the notice I firft took of these al
legations, this had escaped me. It
(hall however now receive the atten
tion to which it is entitled.
To support this charge,a paragraph
stated to be an extract from one of
his letters to the former Congress,
containing some communication re
lative to a proposed transfer of the
French debi, to a company of Dutch
merchants, has been submitted to the
public v: e w. Upon (his ii.igli <j,>cu
ment it has been rested, and upon
this of course mud the demonftraii
on depend.
The extra A in question lias been
repi tfemed to be as follows. " Jfthere

merit.
To exculpate him from tins dilho
norable imputation, even the extract
furnilhed, f\tlfe and deceptive as it
is, upon a found couftruc'tion, would
have been fuSicient. The sole ques
tion it involves is, whether the (.on
grefs would consent that the French
court (houid aliign the debt vve owed
them, to a company of private mer
chants ; whether they would agree,
to pay the latter at the fame time,
â¢nd under the fame conditions, pre

n*Cl\ , JefFsrfon had advocated
this idea, wherein does the turpitude
con/ilt ! Debts between individuals
have this property, and alignments
of ihem are daily supported in the
courts of law and equity. I hose
fiom the public to individuals like
vile have it : indeed the greater
part, perhaps by this time the whole,
of the American debt has undeigune
this process. Upon what principle J
then refule it to thac due to France.'
Dees morality diflinguifti between
the cases ? Or were the claims of
that magnanimous nation, for part
advances, and at a period of great
diftreli, less to be regarded ? or
thole, who were to profit by thetranf
acftion, less the favorites of our go
vernment, than others who have since
infelled its ieat, and preyed upon in
dividuals-
But (he vindication of Mr. J'jffer
fon againlt ibis charge does not reft
upon the above principle. The con-
ot his lettei, even in the extrnc't
published, have been fhamefully mis
represented ; other pat ts, abloluiely
necefl'ary for ihe full conipreheniiyn
of it fupjn elled ; and the propofiiion
* TVk wr-.ter in answer to a very sensible
and well written piece under the oi'
-ARistidk; has confefled that the firit ftateraent
made bv him with 'o much confidence, was in
â¢ccurit'e ; but even here he still rtate> it in a
point of view which jiiftifies the remark I have
nude.
A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED w* 'ui tS n ,v. , r ,,. _ â  '
â~ââ ' ' ;V ' LRUAVS BY JOHN FEN NO, No. 69, HIGH.STREET, I'HIL ADtLI'H
â¢ which he difcauntenanced, nnpofed
on him as his own. 1 have lately
seen an extra A, in pofleflion of a gen
tleman, who was at that time a mem
â  ber of the Congress, and whose au
thenticity cannot be questioned, which
verifies wha< I have here advanced.
The only proportion which he made
< to Congress, was to borrow the mo
ney in Holland, and discharge the
Fi encii debt. 1 his alone was his
wi<h. With tefpeift to the projetfrof
the transfer he was only the vehicle
of communication, and ac the parti
cular request of the agent of the com
pany ; hazarding transiently Â»nly,
m presenting it to the view of that
body, an idea which occurred, and
which mult have occurred to any o
ther pet (on, that it might be better
to have for creditors,thofe from whom
110 friendly offices had been received, I
tha.} a powerful nation who bad al>
ready-conferred, and from whom we
might hereafter have occalion to so
licit, the most important fe'rvices.
Mr. JefFerlon never fought to in-
t 1 ranee : that court- and the
whoie nation would exculpate him
trom the charge. And the imputati
on of intendingany deception on the
mercantile company, is equally falfe
and groundless. By them the con
tract was solicited of France ; and
for t he deposit of twenty millions of
livres, they were to have become in
titled to twenty-four, making there
by a clear gain of four millions,with
the high rate of intered ftipnlated
[by the loan. Our afient was only de
liiedfor its consummation. Is it to
be presumed that this company were
ignorant of the atfiual state of the
iU\Jn or Hf nur ability to pav it ? aiicL.
was it in such event his duty to in
terfere, in derogation of the charac
ter of his country, to warn them of
the danger of our probable failure ?
The person who publilhed the mu
tilated extract pollelles I presume tlie
true one. The whole was deposited
in the quarter from whence it is be
lieved to have been taken. I now
therefore call upon hiin to produce
the imire paragraph in his defence.
In contempt ofofficialduties, as here
tofore suggested and not denied, the
veil of secrecy has been torn from it.
Whatever detriment, if any, could
be futtained from the exposure of a
confidential paper, has been already
rendered. It only remains by the
publication of the truth, to fix the
itigma on him who deserves it. Let j
this likewile proceed from the fame;
party thus notably diftinguilked, in j
| gratification of private fevenge, for;
the pernicious example of a gross j
violation of the duties of a public t
ti ulb, and a glaring outrage on the :
delicacy of a foreign correspondence.
The viiionary danger which threat
ens in the minds of some men, the
public credit, has long been a theme
for copious declamation. An enqui
ry into any proposition, fandioiied
â by a certain party, however uncon
i net'ted wiili it, has been represented
[as f'eeking its deftrurtion ; and thole
who conduct it, though other wife pre
eminent ly d illiuguilhed for their ta
lents, their pairiotifm, their public
and private vittues, as having this
object solely in view. Much labor
and ingenuity have alio been bellow
ed in an effort to iinprefs the public
creditors wi.h a belief iliat 011 the
I'uccels of this enterprising faction, in
all its meafuies, their fafety depends.
Can ihefe arts long bewilder the pub
lie mind, and divert it from the true
object of enquiry ? Can any person
who difpalfionately contemplates the
obvious tendency of meafuies, withj
the known and avowed principles of
those who elpoufe them, doubt that
the end to which they are intended
to be made subservient, far furpafl'es
the honelt boundary of a ftritfl fulfill
ment of the public faith ?

OF the THEATRE
at TURIN
' | ''HE form is that of an egg, cut
acrois. There are fix rows of
boxes, which are narrow in fron f,
but very commodious, and hold eight
perlons each. The king's box is in
the second row, and fronts theftage ;
it is 30 feet wide, Paris meafule, and
the back front is covered with look
i"j- g!-'s, which reflects the stage so,
th 'L thole who happen to have their
backs turned to the adlors, being ei
. ther conversing or at play, may fee
1 the performance in a miiror. These
glafles form a partition, which may
j moved whenever they choose to
: enlarge the box, there being a room
! behind. The very grear breadth of
I tbt ft<age produces a 1110 ft noble ef

duced triumphal cars for great pro
ceflions, liorfes, &c. They can also
throw a draw-bridge across when the

ance for letting in water, so as to pro
duce a jet d'eau of thirty feet high.
Sixty liurfes at a time have been bro't
on the stage, and have manoeuvred

FROM THE CONNECTICUT COURANT.
IF any government has a right to be obeyed
it is a republican government; the people!
only obey themfeivesâ each individual fubmitsi
to the whole ibciety. It is not doing fufficient
justice to republicanism to fay that the people
(Ã¼bmit to authority, they in fact exercise it,
they rule their rulers. In a thouiand forms, in
practice as well as in theory, a republican na- i
tion is the real sovereign ; Americans have bled
to eflablHh this truth, and now lhalJ they deny
it ? rhe world has profited by the lefibnswhich
.;ave coil us iodear, and more than one great
nation is now reducing them to practice, fliall
we, in spite oi our own experience and ap
plause, which encourage us to proceed, tread
backward and !ole our rank among freemen ?
\ve are lead by the extraordinary nature of the
resolutions of certain persons in the back coun
ties of Pennsylvania, to aik whether in our
country these truly republican principles have
trteir authority ? Whether like ingenious
lophifms which are the fafhion of one age and
out oi vogue in the next, they are to be ad
mired in books and rejected in the ad minflra
tion of public affairs ? But the people of Ame
rica know, and it is a truth written with their
biood, that their freedom confifti in their being
governed by laws of their own enacting. It is
a folemtx truth, and to be praefciftd, or law and
equal right, and liberty would lose half their
value by losing all their obligation.âWhat
then fliali we fay to the resolutions ? They af
fe<X to abhor an excile law ; in this pollibly tHey
may be fin cere, and thole will mod readily be
have they are so, who suppose they equally ab
hor all law out their own will, and all govern
ment but their own pafllons. It may not be a
hard or difficult task for a few artful men in a
country where few minifterg of the gospel arc
to be found, and few ii any ichools are kept, to
persuade the uninformed that an excile or any
other law is unfriendly to their liberties. Any
law is unfriend v to the wild liberty of an indi
vidual ; but civil liberty cannot fubifift an hour
wiitjppt 'aw-âthe liberty a ftromger man than I
las to knock me the headmuirbe refrained,
or I can enjoy no liberty. We think the people
oi the New-England States do not love liberty
ieis than the iettlers in the back parts of Penn
fvlvania ; yet they have been long used to an
excile, and submit to it cbearfully, as they fee
the Treasury of the United States filled with
the monies arising from the duties on their dis
tilleries. Direct taxes are by this means nfvoid
ed, and the farmer is left to pursue his impor
tant calling without interruption. But arc the
frontiers of Peunfylvania to be defended by
committees of correspondence created for the
express purpose of opposing the laws ? Are they
to be exempt from the very taxes which #aufe
the ilream of public money to continue to flow
mto that country who will not pay a far thine,

aw might perhaps be wanting in many provi
ions to feenre its due execution ; but it has
icver been Oicwn (and is hardly pretended) to
save any tiiinic in it more dangerous to liberty

uen were not wanting who made it a business
o blow up the minds of the people Â«i<yiintl the
â >tcife. Every body knows how restless and
mprincspled men get power and influence, in
urbulent times*â-for that end they seize every
Â»ccafion to make the times turbulent. All
nefe allowances have been made for the oppo
ers of the lawâtime ha-, been allowed for their
>aflions to subside, and their prejudices to wear
'Ut > tueir outrages have been winked at, and
n condescension to them the law has been re
afed, and almost every exceptionable or ob
loxious part, as far as could cor.fift with* the
xecution of Â«t, has been modified. The in
rcafcd and increasing expence of an Indian
var w,:y;'\ carries tie solid wealth of the other
â¢aits of the United States into the wilderness,
eemed !:o be iufLcient to silence those who are
o direftlv interested ; but we behold with re
;ret and ftnpi'ife t'.iat a plan of opposition to
he law has been matured into a l vftcm. A
neeting of private persons aifqmes for the back
ounties of Pennsylvania, the authority of a
"Ã¼blic body. Any mail wha Hiall be so loft to a
enie of right and wrong as to accept of a com
uifiion from the President of the United States
o execute this law, is to be cut off from focie
y. Like Cain, he is to become on outcast, and
very man's hand is to be railed against him.
â¢Vhat doth all this mean ? the will of part of
tie people of a small part of L e mfylvania, is
âºppofed to the will of the Unired Stales that
s to their lawâ and they let ns know that their
orce also is opposed to that of the nation. Ei
her this open refinance to lawful authority is
o remain or to be suppressed. If it remain,
hen the law must be repealed, for it would be
nonftrous to colledt taxes from those who are
billing to pay, and to excuse those who defy
he power of the Union, and dare you to en
force the laws. If the laws be repealed what
iiall be lubfcituted ? such a law as a Jew indi
viduals will be jlie afed of their own free will to
'bey, or must we do as we can without any
aw of the kind ? What law for collecting an
nternaJ revenue would be fubmittedto by meu
vho pursue measures subversive of all law and
â¢rder, it is not easy to conje&ure. Would they
iot tar and feather a collector of a land or poll
ax? The produce of their farms ij not to be
ouchedâls this not faying government fball
xempt our persons and property from taxes,
aid they are welcome to what they can get
ithei wife. It is a farce to conjecture what re
enue law will suit themâls it poflible to re
>ea' the law in question confillent with the pub
ic good ? The money raised by it, now, mult
â¢e then fought for in some other wayârtne im
loft is already great; will the farmers of Ame
ica now treed from land taxes, and as it were
eftored to the use of their hands, submit to
ave them tied again, and a second time taJke
he miliftone of direst taxation about their
ecks, becaule the frontier people of Pennfyl
ania dislike the present mode of raising mOr
ey ? It no money ought under present circinn
lances to be obtained by dry taxes, and no
nore ought to be railed by iinpoft, what other
noper and adequate revenue is to be eftablifk
td ? none is suggested. Shall the laws of the
Jnited States be opposed, and in effect set
ilide and repealed in the corner of one State ?
Perhaps they will fuffer others to pay, and may
tope money will thus be obtained for public exi
gencies. It concerns the dignity of a repub
ican to shew that the law is really supreme.
The difol>edience of the minority is a wrong
lone the majority-âBurdens are made unequal.
.The conititution of the United States and the
laws of Congress have made provision for exeÂ«-
cuting the lawful authority, and they are no
more than a dead letter if it be not done. A
tardy support of the law is a surrender of it.
It can only embolden the oppofersâ-it will ag
gravate the malady whick must be destroyed or
it will destroy.FOR THE GAZETIE OF THE UNITED STATE*,

from its being in that ch'fte and free Gazette, aj

JFieneau being t raffia tor of French was in duty
bound to translate it ; and in rhyme too, as he is
a poet. Many admirersof t"c chaste style of that

Mr. Claypoole,

ot Vermont would mo'.t probably give a unani
mous vote for t':e re-ele<stion of George Walh
ington and John Adam*, to the office of Prefi
dci t and Vice-Pr\,';dent of the United States.
J could wish to hint to the public the reason
why the Vermont Ek-ftors will so vote, efpeci
allywith refpett to the latter gentleman j which
is, that they believe hint a true friend to the in
terefti oi the United State--, a true friend to its
conftitut on, a Sim and true republican, of ho
ne!l and independent lentiments, and a man
wl.n prelides, in his present fta>ion, with the
ftiiiSefl integrity and impartiality This opi
nion, I believe, is alto entertained by the Ver
mont representatives in both bouses of Con
gress. I know also, that every person of libe
ral and honest sentiments, who is acquainted
wit i Mr. Adams, will, and does freely acknow
ledge it to be well funded. I will add, that I
believe Mr. Adams is too honest a man to dif

WA gentleman, *rr!*ed OT Tuesday from
' Cape-Francoh, informs u-, that the colony, al
the time of his departure, which was the 2r ft
of last month, wa; 111 a more diftrafted ftatt
than it has been at any period since the rebel
lion of the negroes. Discord and confulion Jceni
to have erected their ftantlard at the Capeâ
Party Ipirit is wound up to a pitch that has fel
doin been equalled, even in the most violent
and difafterous revolutionsâThe common and
inveterate enemy to the white people (the re
bel negroes) is nearly forgottenâand the colo
nists are totally ablorbed in animolity againll
each other.
Tuesday evening the 23d ult. a fire brokeout
in Fayetteville, North-Carolina, which raged
in fiich a tremendous manner ai to consume 61
buildings before it was checked. Col. lames
Porterfield is t ie greatest fuiierer in buildings ;
the hon e> he has loft colt 6000 pounds. The
value of the whole number of buildings burnt,
is eltimated at Thirty Thousand Pounds No
estimate can at present be made of the loss of
goods. âThe mod prÂ»babie account of the
cause of this unfortunate event, is, that a small
negro girl of' Col. Dekeyfer's, accidentally caught
a broom-straw r.iat on fire in t ie garret with a
candle.
Thisis a severe stroke to Fayetteville, wtnch
tan only be said to i>e in its infancy: But it is
â with much fatisfaftibn obfarved, that the fuf
ferers, in general, are in goodsspits, and many
Â«f them already making preparations to build
â¢pinâand, we hope in a few months to have
the plealure of announcing to the public, that
that part of the town is completely rebuilt.
The Canal intended to unite the waters of
Snfqueharinah and Schuylkill, was begun on F'ri.

of t''e Scimjlkill and Delaware, was begun on
Tue/ilty iafi -voek, near Norriftpii Mills.
The !:ig' y improved state ofrhe arts in Eng
land, may be in some measure conjectured from
the following cirfcumftances: âThere is now
publiihing in London, a splendid edition of
Siakefpeare, the fubfeription p ice is ninety
guinea;! Also, an edition of Hume's Hiftorv
of England, in live- volumes, with notes bv Dr.
Kippi -, and a continuation bv Dr. Tosvers the
fiib/cription to which is fixtv guineas 1 Tho'mp-
Seaf'ons are likewise to be publiflied by lub
fc'ri .tion, at four guineas each.
These works are to be highly embelliflied
with Kllturical and iJlaftrative print-, bv the
most eminent eftg. avers, from pictures painted
on ourpoie, by tile lirft t (Is in Eng'and.
T ie ea-ernefs with which the fubfeription
lift: to these eLgant chef d'esuvres of art' are

It is I.ra:ige that a ])eople but jtjft rescued
from the galling yoke of foreign bondage, hav
mgjuft got rid oi a delpotic government, will
not I'ulimit to orje free and equal. What avails
itto be exempt from the chains of a prccari

<-i '-iie of their own corrupt nature? The
Jnuillf ft tax, though abfblutely neceliary for the
public lafety against a barbarous lavage enemy,
and tending alf'o to promote industry, and to re
train excess in the u'e of an intoxicating and
deftruflive (pirit, makes them reftiefs and im-
latierir. They quarrel wiih a constitution and'
government, purclialed at the expence of much
blood and treasure, and framed by themfelvc , ;
'h'-'y deipife the rulers of their own choice, and
trample on laws of their own making, What
occofion is there for such violent and unwar
rantable proceedings ? If any law fliall bear
heavy oil the citizens, or any class of them, why
dp they not represent the cafe to the proper le
gillature, composed of persons eletfled by them
lelves ? Ti the complaint is founded in reason,
the ' may be sure of redrel's. The difeale mult
be .nown belore the remedy can be applied. I
Men who re v J order, tranquility and peace; :
men who love their country, will use all honest I

Yesterday at II o'clock the Senate of the
United States waited on the Prciident at his
own houfe,with the following arldrels in answer
to his Speech to both Houses.
To the Prejident of the United States.
ACCEPT, Sir, our grateful acknowledge
ments for your address at the opening of the
prefect feji.on. We participate with you in
the fatisfa&ion ariiing from the continuance of
the general profpeiity of the nation ; bur it ii
not Without the most sincere concern that we
are informed, that the reiterated efforts which
have been mnde to eftablilh peace with the hos
tile Indians have hitherto failed to accomplish
; thnt defied obje& : hoping that the measures
still dependiag may prove more fiiccelsful than
those which have preceded them, we ihall ne
ve rthelefs concur in every necelTary prepara
t'on for the alternative ; and fhoirld the In
dians on either fide of the Ohio persist in their
hoftilitie?, fidelity to the Union, as well as affec
tion for our fellow-citizen son the frontiers,'wiM
insure our decided co-operation in every mea
sure, which shall be deemed requisite for tijeir i
protection and fafety.
At the fame time that we avow the obliga
tion of the government to afford its prote&ion
to every part of the Unionâwe cannot refrain
f rom exprefling our regret that even a Iniall
portion of our fellow citizens in any quarter or
it, fhouid have combined to oppose the opera
tion of the law for the collection of duties on
spirits diltilled within the United States; a law
| repeatedly famflioned by the authority of the
[ nation, and at this juncture materially con
nected with the fafety and prote&ion of those
who oppose itâShould tHemeans already adopt
ed, fail in securing obedience to this Jaw, Arch
further measures as may be thought neceiiary
to carry the fame into complete operation, can
not fail to receive the approbation of the legif-
Jature, and the support of every patriotic ci-
tizen.
It yie'ds us particular pleasure to learn that
the produftivenefs of the revenue tf the pre
'ent year, will probably fupefcede the neeeffity
of any additional tax for the service of the
next. â¢
The o'ganization of the government of the

COMMUINICATION.
At the present crifs the old enemies of the

. alert. When they found that the people were
. too wife to be influenced by their counsel and
. advice in rejefling the confutation ; they then
/aid, that there was flill one way leit to effect
their purpoleâand that was to render the aa
minijlration of the government odiousâln pur
suance of their object they have employed the
press, and secret emifTaries in aJmoii -.ill parts
of ti.e union to mfaprelent, deceive and de
fume ; they began their artifices with the fiift
operations of the governmentâbut their at
tacks were principally confined to general flan
ders, and were made occafionaUy.âlt is now
ahout one year since the government and its
measures have drawn forth the concentred force
of the whole part}.âFrom the "executive
cliici down through the subordinate depart
ments with a very few exceptions, a continued
torrent of innuendoes, fianders and falfehootis
has illued from its proper fourcc, through its
appointed medium. There are various oltenfi
ble objects of complaint which form the topics
ot declamation to the inveterate esemies of
our union and government; the Jvndivg f .flctn,
the e\t.je law, and the Bank compose the principal
tuc but it would be intuiting to the plaincft
understand :ng t and wholly undervaluing the
Jiugment and penetiation of the party, to sup-
P u ' e ' 'j at their opposition to these measures are
any thing more than a feint, a covert to their
mam design, that of subverting the constitution.
i hose measures are f'o obviously the result of
t atjiiitiee and gbod faith on which alone any
ccnmtutioD or form of government can befup
ported, that thole who think lightly of public
credit or of the means of maintaining it, are in
'tart enemies to any permanent and eife&i\e
government whatever.

SACRED SCRIPTURES

APOCR Y PHA,
Bn a very large and beantiful new Tyft, tnij^e
THE great importance of .he Holy Scripture!
interesting to every individual; the divine exccU
lenceofiu and precepts, and the b< amy
and fublimitv of its passages, have so long â¢de i.
a capital ohjeft of attention, as to preclude occa
sion or opportunity for eulogium.
The p.eiv or emerprize of individuals has pre.
fented this invaluable hook to the public in a VJ .
rirtv of forms ; in some editions it has been highly
enibclltlhcd wiih superb engravings, winch h, (c
greatly enhanced its price; in others it hai been
I accompanied with voluminous commentaries
1 which necessarily encreafcd the size; while a va~
; riety of plain cheapcopies have generally difFufcd
|ihe knowledge of the Scripiure, and made the
I purchase easy to every class.
Without wifiling in the smallest degree to Itffrn
the merits of the various editions, whether p/ain
or ornamen.'ed, *vhich the public aie already iÂ«
potfeflion of, it is pertinent, to remark, that very
many readers of talk and judgment have expre(Ted
a wi(h for a Family Rible unencumbered with ad
ditions. There still appeais room for another*
edition on a beautiful new type, superior in fizc
and elegance to any bible that has yet hem printed
in the Englifti language, and which, leaving the
adventitious circumftanres of oinament or com
ment, TWÂ»y exhibit the Oracles oj God in their m
ti\e limplicity. Â«
SPECIMEN OF THE TYPE.
5 And God said,
d Let there be light: and
there was light.
With refpe&ful fubmiflion to the judgment and
candour of the public, the following proposals arc
offered :
I. The work (liall be printed with thegreatcft
fidelity and attention to corre&nefs both in the
text and marginal referenres, on a fuperfine Paper
made on purpol'e, with an elegant new Type cast
for the work of the fi*e of the above Specimen.
11. The work will be comprised in twenty
number?, making two elegant volumes in FoHo;
10 be furnifhed to fubfci ibers at one dollar each
number. To prevent any complaints of want of
pun&uality, no part of the work wll be delivered
unleT paid for.
111. The fir ft number, containing sixty folio
pages, elegantly printed, will be furnifhed on the
firft Saturday of July next, when fnbfcribers are
to pay the price of the firft and second numbers,
and the price of one number to be always in ad
vance till the work is completed. The subsequent
numbers to be publtfhed regularly on the firft Sa
turday of cach succeeding month, till the who)#
