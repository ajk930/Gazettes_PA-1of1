Pronl the si fft of* those letter.?,; da ted u Paris
the 2X&December, it appears that Mr.
Jefferfon among other topics of objcjftioi), " clif
liked, and greatly difiiked tlte abandonment of*
the principle of rotation in office, a:;c] ir.oft p ar
ticular fy in the cafe of Ptefulent from which
tlte inference is clfcar, tliat he WOtild hc(ve \Hoi
ed the principle df rotation to have extended
not only <feo ttoe -executive, but to othpi
branches of the go.vernment, to the. Senate at
! Jeafl, as is explained bv a fiiufequent letter. â
This objection goes to the ftrufrure ai' the go
veVnnient in a very important Article ; and
while It juftifies' the afl'ertion, that Mr. Jeffer
forf was-oppofed to the conflfifcution, in fomco/ ih
mojl impoitant features, it is a fpeciipen,of the vi
iionarv system of politics of its author. Had
it been confined to the office of chiet
it might haVe pretended not only to plaufibiiitv,
l?Ut t6 a degree of weight and refpo(sHbilitv.
Bv being extended to other branches of the. go
vernment, it aflumes a different characlef, and
evinces amine} prone to proje.ifh, which are in
compatible with the principles of liable and fyi
tematic government; difp6*e"d to multiply the
outworks, and leave the citadel weak and tot
tering.
But; the faCh not the meri/<bf the â¢objaftioh is
!jp ipfteri^ljpp,^., : iitcWlÂ® 5
.uliwup to the. suggestion, which has, be.eri.i)}ade.
It now* only'remains to (ee.howlar It .ivpro-i
â¦Ed; the!
adoption of the conft'.tution in its ptfiTtltive,
twrm.' 1 I
Of this a person acquainted with the manner
of that gentleman, and with the force of terms,
will find fufficietft evidence in the following
pafTagt: 1 ' Ido not pretend to decide, What would
be the heft method ot procuring the establish
ment tfft'ie manifold things ill t.it confti-
Uition, and o igelling r:d oj the bid: whether by
adopting it tti hopes of future amendment ; or
after it has been duly weighed and canvafTed by
the people; after'feeing the parts they generally
dislike, and those they generally approve to fay
to tlMm'i " we fee now what von tvifliââ 'end
together your deputies againâ-let them frame
a couftitution for you ; omitting what you have
condemned, and eltabliihing the poweis > on ap
prove-"
Ms. lefirfou did not e-tplicifly decide which
two mcries waslieft ; and whilew is dear,
notdeteimined irr favor of an adoption
without previous amendments, it isjioWiflicult
to iuier front the teran of expression employed,
that he preferred the last of tpe tco modes ; a
recurrence to a lecond convention. The faint
nefs of the phrase " in hopes of future amend
ment," and thtf einpbaticat method of difpjav
ing the alternative are fuliicient indications of
the preference he entertained.
The pains which he takes in the fame letter
tec remove the alarm naturally inspired by the

5 natural to infer, that had the whole of Mr.
[efteriem's ,correspondence 011 the fubjeft been
iiven to the public, much greater diverfi'ties
vould Have'been ditcovered.
In the preface to the puWitatiori of the le't
ers under coitfideration, the question is put,
' wherein was the merit or offence of a favor
ible or unfavorably opinion of the
md to whom rendered V
It is a futticient answer to this qu'erfion, as it
â elates to the pnefent difenflion, to lav, that the
ntimation which was given ot Mr. Jenerfon's
lillike ps the conft'.tutioi., in the firft instance,
vas evidently not intended as the imputation
if a pofjtive crime, but ;ts one link ii> a chain
.f evidence tending to prove th,at the National
isifetteWa? cttAdtlftcd ilhtitr His ailfpites, and
n confoiVnity to hi* view>s.
After lliewing that the Editor of that paper
vas in his pay, and had been taken into it foine
hort time previous to the commencement of
he publication, the inference rcfnlting from
:he circumstance, of that paper being a politi
:al engine, in his hands, is entleavbred to be
.orroborated, ffrlt by the ftfggtfttohthai Mr.
lefferfon had originally serious objections to the
â¢oaftitutio!); fecpmUyJjy the further fuggeftio.i,
:hat he h?s difapprpved cf mcft of the impor
:ai?t measures adopted in the course of the ad
nWiftration of the government.
In this light, and with this special reference
vera those iuggpftions made ; and certainly, a:
ar as tliev are founded jii fact, th<; argument
:hev afford i; fair and i'o; ciblc. A tonefpnn
\: ."cv of the principle-, and opinion". of Mr. Jef
'ji'oii, v it'a :>< complexion of ,1 paper, the
â ortdurtor of Â« Vch is in the rcÂ«.i;l;i,- pay of his
lepartmcht, is surely a ftxong continuation of
he conclulion âthat tire pap.ji is conduced un
ler his influence, and ag'Cua':>!y to his views.
Nothing but a known opposition of sentiment
on tba part of Mr. Jefferfoh to th'e dotfrines in-
culcated in the National Gazette, could obvi
ate the inference deducible from his afcertain
9Â«l#nd Vliny BHtraordinarY qonneftion with it.
A coinÂ«idence of Â£ntiiÂ«ents is a dirert and ir

What''a wretched apology ! Eccaufetlic par

The refufal, if it happened, is one of those

PARIS, August 14.
THIS capital is now, after fix Jays
of toniult, jii a (late of peace.
The populace no longer fill the itreets
and the crowd round the National
Allembly is 110 greater than ulual ;
even the forlorn 1 huilleries has a!
mod ceased to be ail obje<!t of curio
sity.
Nothing transpires concerning the
coiidutf of the king and queeu in
their new habitation, the temple,rind
indeed there is very little enquiry
concerning them. 1 hey are lodged
in an upper suite of apartments, the
heighth of which as a lecurity againfl
escape, donbtlels made a conliderable
part of their recommendation.
The executive power, in the mean
time, begins to acquire somewhat of
form and consistency. The National
Afiembly have decreed, that a Nati
onal Council ihall lit, for theexercife
of this power, each member of which
shall, in his turn, fill the President's
chair; that all pi oceedings (hall be
in the name of the nation ; and that
their seal (hall itnprefs only the si
gure of liberty, with a suitable in
scription.
The Aflembly determined, that the
King's rcfideme lhotiUl be at the
Teirtple Y to which he (liould be con
ducted ;he next day.
August* tj
The troops took their appointed
polls at two o'clock, and the King
with his family arrived in perfect
fafefy at the temple, of which a re
port was instantly made by M. Petion
to the Aflembly
At the places where the Itatues oi
ormer Kings had been demolilhed,
he crowd was greatest ; and at each
>f these the populace, remembering
low much the glories of these mo
larchs had impoveriflied the nation,

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
August 9.
A letter from M. Jolivef, a mem
ber, was readâlt set forth, rhat he
liad been yelterday at M. Vaublanc's
house. He saw fcveral people ot the
doorâTo learn what was going for
ward, he walked up and down the
Rue St. Honore. As he palled by the
Jacobins, he perceived a prodigious
crowd in the yard. He went into
the crowd ; and learning that the Ja
cobins were going to relate several
recent events, he stepped into the
hall. He heard the following ques
tion agitated :
" How (liall the names of those
members of the National Afl'embly
who are fold to the Civil Lilt, and
voted for La Fayette, be made known
through the kingdom?
Then M. Monteaux de Montreal, a_
member of the National Allembly,
Prelident of the Jacobin Club, put the
question thus :
" Lst those who vvifh to pals to
the order of the day, on the motion
of posting up the names of the mem
bers fold to the Civil I.ift, and who
voted for La Fayette, (land up."
M. Merlin interrupted the Secre
tary, and declared that M. Jolivet is
an infamous liar.
M. Girardin asked and obtained
leave to speak. Hefaid, hehadbeeri
(truck near the National Assembly.
M. Merlin a(ked him on what part
of his body. M. Girardin answered
with disdain â behind to be Cure,
where vile afl'affins llrike ; but he de
clared he had not been touched by
any citizen of Pari.?.
M. Vaublanc,M.La Fayette's friend
and advocate, ran to the tribuneâ
My houl'e, (aid he, was belieged ; the
villains not finding me at home, allied
for my wife and my children ; their
[heads, said they, would lit well on a
pike until mine was placed on oneâ
my family escaped by means of a lad
der ; but 1 shall never perjure myfelf,
1 shall vote as 1 think. â I voted for
La Fayette yeilerday ; to-day I will
vote for his King and mine. â Let ns
leave this wicked town, where liberty
is no more. No doubt, continued he,
there are few in this House of M.
Kerfaint's dilpofition, few who think
that the matter before us is not fuffi
cieutly important. He concluded
with moving, that the Attorney Ge
neral flionld be summoned to the bar
to declare what measures he had a
dopted to maintain good order. He
added with moving, that the confe
derates should (lay no longer in the
capital.
M. Lagrevole wished the Mayor of
Paris to be sent for also, that he might
declare whether or not he could an
swer for the fafety of th<? National
Aflembly.
M. Choudieux was convinced, that
since the National Aflembly had ab
solved the factious soldier, they were
no longer capable of governing the
(late.
The Aflembly decreed, that the
Mayor of l'aris, and the Attorney Ge
neral of the Department, fliould come
to the bar.
The Attorney-General came to the
bar.âHe declared, that the General
Council were informed, that several
members of the Aflbmbly had been
inlulted and (truck ; âthat at mid
night (Thursday) the alarm-bell was
to be rang to aflemble all ihe citi
zens, in ordpr to invert the Palace ofj
the Thuilleries.
August 1
M. Merlinâ" I announce to the

The Committee of fafety have more
than 400 letters in their poHellion,
which prove that the plan and time
of this attack were known in Paris,
and that Paris is the focus of the con

the Emigrants, as well as the family
of Louis XVI. be detained as hoftag

A lift was ordered to be primed of
nil the members who were prelent on
the tenth, and of the hour at which
they severally took the oaths, toge
ther with the motives assigned by
those who were absent, and sent the
fame in writing.
M. Bazire read some papers found
in an efcrntoire of the King's, which
contain a llatement of the expences
of the King of France's household ai
Coblentz.
One of them is a letter from M;
fie Poix, who remits to the King an
account of the payments made to his
four companies of Gardesdu-Corps,
since the ift of July, 1791. M. de
Poix remarks with what alacrity he
has executed his Majesty's withes 011
an objetft so ipteretting to his heart.
Anprher letter is dated Coblentz,
7th o<ft. 1791, without signature, the
anonymous writer gives an account
of the military chest, Slid of the Anns
he has received for the four compa
nies. The Aflembly ordered the pa
fperp to be printed, and sent into the
eighty-three departments.
The author of a third, letter, dated
31ft January, 1792, seems to have in
view the reinftatenients of the Parli
aments and the restoration of the or
ders.
The reporter of the Extraordinary
Commiflion informed the Aflembly
that the King's Civil Lift, had been
confiuned in keeping in pay a vast
number of writers, the names and
objects of whose writings he gave a
Hft of. While this was reading,the As
fembly interrupted him by pronounc
ing; the following decree in a rranf
port of rage ! âThe Aflembly decrees,
that the fathers, the mothers, the
wives, and children of Emigrants
(hall be put in a slate of arrest, and
be kept as hostage* for the ill* which
the Emigrants will produce in France.
Soon after, a decree of accusation

M. Merlin announced, that the
Pruffinns had been driven from the
town of Sierck by Marflial Luckner :
That the enemy while in pofleffion
of the town, had committed great ex
ceflTes ; that they had been committed
by an emigrant who marked out cer
tain victims, and the houl'es to be
burnt and pillaged ; but that this
man had been taken, and is now in
he prison of Thionville.
M. Merlin requeued that a severe
law might be pafled against the in
ternal Emigrants, who pointed out
to the enemy thole citizens on whom
they wilhed them to exercifc their
vengeance, and those traitors totheir
country whom they ought to spare.
The Aflembly said, that laws exist
ed for punishing that traitor, but
charged the Committee of Legislation
to-propofe more severe ones for such
as might in future commit the like
crimes
M. Montmorin 's papers seized
and he himfelf ordered to be arretted,
but he had quitted Paris with his wife
and children fonie days befoie.

The citizens came up with an ad
dress, complaining of the flow pro
ceedings of the Tribunals in judging
the Prisoners of State. They said
that if the Swiss officers in particular
were not speedily brought to trial,
there would be a new infurr.e<ftion ;
that the tocsin was ready to be mng.
But the objert of this petition had
been obviated by a decree, which the
Aflembly had just made for the for
mation of a new jury, taken from the
Electoral Corps ; and it was publiflv
ed soon after in all quarters of Paris.
A letter from Marefchal Luckner
was read ; it contained nothing re

Through the thick mist of parry,
it needs " a Dragon Watch with nn
enchanted eye" to discern any thing
truly. They who reprobate the pfe
fenr disorders in France, ate ftiled
the enemies of Freedom. They who
defend them, rhe enemies of all go
vernments. Alas! confufion of ideas
is pJone to blame in this apparent di
versity ; and without mutual concel
fion, the fair front of Political truth
can never be discovered. Efficient
government, equally admitted by all
parties in the fact to be necejfary, is
by all, at present, denied there to
exiit.
The present reign of the Jacobins,
and the delation of the common people
of Franco, is not unprecedented in
their l.iftory. The fair provincei of
that kingdom in the time of their
Fifth Charles, were devallated by an
infamous rabble, ft:iled a Jacqueiir
(fotnewhat near Jacobin) whose fir It
principle was a hatred of Nobles, and
whose object was the extermination
of the superior orders. Then, how

The following particulars tefpetft
ing the Royal Family of France, du
ring the dreadfol scenes which lately
disgraced Paris, have not yet been
communicated to the public.
The King, Queen, and their chil
dren, were thrust into the President's
room, adjoining to the Assembly.â
This room had in it only a few bare
fourms, npon which they lay during
the nights of Fridav and Saturday.
For the firft twelve hours of their
confinement, not a foul went near
th em, nor had they any kind of re
freihment. At length one of the
door-keepers went and pnrcliafed, out
of his own pocket, a few biscuits and
a bottle of wine, which he brought
to them.
The feelings of the unhappy Mo
narch. and his contort, it is almost
impoflible to imagineâin the mo
mentary dread of insult and outrage,
and if spared from the butchering
hands of the savages who were de
inolifbing the Palace, with the horrid
profpetft of feeing their children pe
rilh for wane! Such accumulation of
misery hittorv cannot parallel !
Ihe King and his family are now
in close cultody in the Temple of the
Palace, formerly belonging to the
Duke of Orleans, and their keepers
are the mob.
In addition to the horrid excefTes
already detailed, the mob have broke
into all the prisons at Orleans, and

-Cherokee towns are boftiJely disposed, and will
act in concert with the Creeks. A body of the
Cherokees, Creeks and Shawanefc, in ail about
s>o inen, are now out, and it is supposed will
tall upon the settlements at Cumberland or
Holftein. Col. Anderfon has erected four block
nouses on the frontiers ; and, we are informed
that the governor has sent forward a large sup
ply of arms and ammunition, with orders to
the Commanding oficer in ninety-fix diftricl to
have the militia put in a date of preparation for
afrive duty, and to raise and equip a troop of
horse for each of the regiments.
On Saturday the President of tbeUnited State?,
his Lady and Family, arrived in town from
Mount Vernon, Virginia.
We are authorized to allure the public, that
the following is the purport of* the information
received from Governor Blount.
Qn the nth of September last, he states that
the fcherokees of the five lower Torres on tl>e
Tene'ee, headed by John Watts, had declared
War against the United States, and that the
warriors, according to various information,
amounting from three to fix hundred, including
about one hundred Banditti Creeks, had set out
upon some expedition against the frontiers,pro
bably against the Cumberland settlement.
That iu consequence of this alarming intelli
gence, he b:*d ordered one regiment of the mi
fitia of Wa&ington district into actual service,
and that he bad alio- dispatched an express to
Mejo diftrict,on Cnmberlar.d river, with orders
to brigadier-general Robertfon, to put his bri
gade into the best pofiible fta?e of defence.
| That the Cherokcea had never complained to
him of a (ingle infraction of the treaty cf Hol
| item, nor did he know of one committed by any
citizen of the United States.
But on the 15th of September, he writes that
he had received letters from Efquaka, other
iwiie the Bioodv Fellow and the Glass, dated on
the ioth of Sept. at the Look-out mountain
town, informing that they, with the afliilance
of Jpbn Watts and other head men, had prevail
ed the party that were collected for war,
tadifperfe and go peaceably to their hunting. |
That upon receiving this agreeable information,
he had been induced to difclrarge the regiment
of and to dil'patch an express to General
Robertfon, of Mero district, with orders to dis
charge foch of bis brigade as might be in ser
vice under the orders of the i ith instant.
We have the pleasure of informing the pub
lic, that the Light-house on Cape-Henry is near
