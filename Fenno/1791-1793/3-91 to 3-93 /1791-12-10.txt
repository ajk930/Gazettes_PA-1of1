isoffuch that mobs are always tompofed. Wlie
ther a man is much of a pliilofopher or not, he
cannot well avoid reflecting on the mifchiefs
"done, and lofles of property fnfrered, as well as
the terror, diflurbance and disgrace, refultin"-
from these violent disorders. A mail will then
fee that, as the niofl: ignorant of men are the ac

of all the mifchief. In (lead of hanging men,
though doubtless tHey deserved the gallows, let
the government of England look to the root of
the evil. The loss of property is said to have
amounted to fouie hundred thousand pounds
sterling. Had the interell of the sum been ap
plied for the support of schools, and the rioters,
in their youth, been taught in them, it is proba
ble that they would not have been concerned.â
From whence it may be inferred, that the negle<fl
of education costs more than the provision for it.
For it is certainly right, in keeping the accouut
between ignorance and knowledge, to charge the
former with the mifchief it does. A fchool-honfe

half the people to keep the quiet in
their beds !âor will our men of humanity, and
our politicians, bestir themselves at last, and by
establishing schools, get at the fountain head of

THE Bourdeaux chamber of commerce has im

the whites to the mulattoes in St. Domingo. This
is diretftly contrary to the opinion of ihe citizens
of Bourdeaux, who in their petition on this fub

soldiers, to compell the coloniits to comply with
the decree of May iytli. The municipality and
friends of the conllitutioti wiihed to prevent the
fetiing out of the meflenger that had been en
gaged to carry the address of the chamber of
commerce to the National Afi'enibly ; but the

considering, no doubt, that the commercial ill

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
FRIDAY, December 2.
(CON C LUDF.D.)
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE,
On the Appropriation Bill for the year I 792.
A/TR- GILES was of opinion that the commit
tee had done their duty, and had acted in
conformity to the resolution of the House. Me
mentioned his being one of" a final I minority a
gainst that resolution, when it was under confe
deration. At that time, he said, he was of opi
nion, that some previous examination was neces
sary.
He adverted to the eflimate from the Secreta
ry ot the Senate. That officer called for 4JOO
dollars, for contingent expences, though it did
not appear that there was a deficiency in thefum
of 3 000 dollars granted last year. Theonlyrea
fon that was given for an increase of jo percent,
was, the increased price ef the articles to be pur
chased. He was against allowing an unneceflary
latitude in appropriations. It would generally
l->e found, tie hi<i < [hat the expenditures would
come up very near iâ fhe fu m appropriated ; and
if 3000 dollars were (ast year, it remain
ed to be determined whether the increased price
of articles warranted an increase of 50 per cent,
in the funis to be appropriated now. Jf an in
crease in the appropriations for the department
of war, from good reasons, was neceflary, this
was no reason why the contingent expences of
the Senate should increase. He hoped the paflage
ot the bill would not be precipitated,, and was
of opinion that information fliould be previously
Obtained.
He approved of thÂ« idea suggested by Mr. Ger
ry, to call on executive officers at ltated times
for th eir accounts. It had been said that mem
bers could seek for information at their offices ;
he thought it more proper that the officers should
be called upon to bring their accounts to the
House. He did not like the mode pointed out ;
and, indeed even supposing the members had ne
gletfted a duty, yet he hoped further time would
not be refufed. He was for the committee's ris
ing.
Mr. Barnwell was of opinion, that the report
of the Treasurer, containing a full account of
the receipt a..4 expenditure of all the public mo
ney, was the fullelt information that need be re
ceived, neither the members of the House, or a
committee of it, could poilibly examine into the
minutia* and items of every public accountâThe
Comptroller, Treasurer and Register were the
proper officers to do this. If any member of the
House was diflaiisiied with any particular charge
received at the treasury, he could either as an
individual call and examine into its propriety,or
on the floor of the House call for the informati
on he wanted to latisfy his mind.
Mr. Fitzfiinons was againit the committee's
rising. Many of the items in the appropriation
bill were right without doubt, and papers were
on the table to explain the propriety of others.
Salaries would not be disputed. If clerks were
unemployed at the ofaces,they would not be paid.
The contemplated appropriations for contingent
and incidental expences depended on estimates
which were before the committee ; and if any
are thought too coniitlerable, motions may be
made to reduce them ; but to rife now wouid be
mere waste of time. He enumerated fomeof the
objefis of expence which called for a larger ap
propriation this year to remove the general ob
jections of the gentleman from Virginia.
Mr. Madifou considered the present a good op
portunity to determine how far the House could
go into an examination of the accounts of public
officers. It was true that the representatives of
the people were the guardians of the public mo
ney. and consequently it was their duty to fatisfy
ihemfelves as far as possible of the sources fromwhich money flowed j nto thetreafnryâhow that
money was appliedâunder what antbority, and
to enquire at different times what balance actual
ly remained in the treasury. This he conceived
could be(t be done by appointing a committee
periodically to examine the books of the Trea
su rer, fee what balance appeared on the facc of
them, and enquire whether that balance was re
ajly in the treafurj'
He mentioned the practice of the former Con
gtefs to appoint four committees to infpeift the
operations of the four departments under them.
These departments, he observed, however, now
belonged more to the executive ; but Hill as the
i eprelcntatives were by the conffitution, made
the guardians of the public money, they had a
right and it was their dnty to infpcdt the opera
tions of the treasury department. This light
could not be conveniently exercised, in liis opi
nion, by the whole body, but fhouldby a detach
ment from it who would report the neceflary in
formation. This mode of proceeding wasufual,
âhe inflanced the practice of the Britifii Honfe
of Commons, and of several Hate legislatures.
Even if these enquiries procured no more infor
mation than was obtained by means of reports
from the different officers ofgovernment, yet be
ing made by the immediate representatives of
the people they would give more fatisfaiftion.
So far as it was tifeful to afcertaiu the real ba
lance in the treasury, so far these periodical com
mittees would be of the firft utility. A queftiou

committee fiiould be flopped t'l make those en

on the supposition that all was right. He wiih
ed the proper regulations on this fubjeifl fettled,
as Handing regulations, and to be adopted before
any idea of their necelfity should arise from sus
picious circumftnnces.
Mr. Lawrance wilhed to proceed in the bill as
far as the information already in the pofleffion
of the House would carry them.
,Mr\ Gerry made some observations to (how that
acc&mits i'rom the trea(Wy could never give the
information wantedâthey generally stated Turns

of particular,objetfVs to which they were meant

question was put, and the committee rose to fit

TUESDAY, December 6
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
On the Pojl-Office Bill.
Mr. Sedgwick moved to strike ont all that
clause which delignated the roads and toinfert,
instead thereof, rhefe words, " by such route, as
the President of the United States Jhall, frotn time to
time, cause It be eflablijhed."
It had appeared, he said, co be the fenfeof the
House, when this fubjeot was formerly under
coniiderdtion, that the demarcation of the par
ticular roads should be entrusted to the execu
tive :âthe only difference had been with refpecft
to the mode of expression ; but the effeift was
ffill to have been the fame ; fotne gentlemen
thinking it bell to leave the details of this bu
siness entirely to the fupreirie executive, orhers
wifiling to name the poftmafte'ii-general. The
members ot the house, he observed", could not be
ftippofed to possess every information, that might
be requilite, on this fubjeJi ; and their opinions
were liable to be bialled by local interefls : he
had ever considered it as highly incumbent on the
house to give the people every poflible informa
tion on public concerns :âbut in this, as in eve
ry other fubjec'i, he thought it fufficientthat the
house should eftabliih the principle, and then
leave it to the executive to carry it into effect.
Mr. Livermore \cbferved, that the legislative
body being empowered by the conftiru;ion << to
establish poll-offices and-p'oft. roads" it is as clear
ly their dnty to designate the roads, as to efta
blifli the offices ; and he .did not think they
could with proptietjydelegaie that power, which
they were themselves/ appointed to exercile : â
some gentlemen, h<f knew, were of opinion,
that the biifinefs of the United States conld be
better tranfafied by a single person, than by ma
ny ; but this was not the intention of the Con
ftitutton but that, it was provided, thatthe
government Ihould be adminillered by represen
tatives, of the people's choice ; Co that every
man, who has the right of voting, (hall be in
lonie meafnre concerned in making every law
for the United StatesâThe eftablillimet.tof pofl
roads heconfidered as a very important objetfl ;
but he did not wish to fee them so diffufed, as to
become a heavy charge where the advantage re
fairing from them would be bnt fmn!l ; nor on
the other hand, for the lake of bringing a reve
nue into the treasury, consent to straiten them
foas to check the progress of information.
If the pott-office were to be regulated by the
will of a single person, the dissemination of in
telligence might be aad the people
kept entirely in the dark with refped: to the
tranfadions of government , âorthe post matter,
if veiled with the whole power, might branch
out the office to i'uch a degree, as to make them
prt>ve a heavy burden ta the United States.âin
many instances, the exptnfe is productive of a
benefit fufficient to counterbalance it : in others,
no public benefit ante? ; . but some individuals
reap a private advantage from the institution,
whilst it is injurious to others.âThe most mate
rial point in his opinion, was to determine the
road itfelf if the house gave up that, they
might as well leave all thereit of the business to
the discretion of the pott-matter, and permit him
to fettle the rates of pottage, and every other
particular relative to the pott-office, by faying at
once " there shall be a pod-matter general, who
(hall have the whole government of the pott-of
fice, under fnch regulations, as he, from time to
time, shall be pleased to enai't.
Mr. Sedgwick felt liimfelf by 110 means dispo
sed to resign all the bofmefs of the House to the
President, or to any one else ; but he thought
that the executive part of the bufmels ouglit to
be left to executive officers :âhe did not, for
his part, know the particular circuinftances of
population, geography, ire. which had been ta.
ken into the calculation by the feiecl committee,
when they pointed nut the roads delineated in
the bill ; but he would ask, whether they under
stood the fubjeÂ»si so tho'oughiy, as the executive
officer would, who beitg refponlib'e to the peo
ple for the proper difciarge ot the trult reposed
in him, mil ft tile his utnoft diligence in order to
a fatisfartory execution of the delegated power?
âAs to the conftitutioaality of this delegation,
it was admitted by the Committee themselves,
who brought in the bill :âfor if the power was
altogether indelegable, no part of it could be
delegated ; and if a pare of it could, he law no
rea/on why the whole could not :âthe second
'feiflion vvas as unconstitutional asthefirfi: ; for
it is there laid, that " it shall be lawful for the
post-matter-general to eflablilh l'uch other roads
Â«is poil-roads. Â« to lym seem rieceilaty."
Congrels, he otfeffrved, are authoiifed not on
ly to ettablifli poft-officÂ«rand polt-roads, but also
to borrow money :âBut is it nnderiiood thai

office to determine the principle on wltic* the

the power of carrying their, refoH."ei*into execu

and if no part of their he
did not know but they to turn
coiners, and work in the mint :ânay
they nuift even act the part of eJHkfipfcners, in
punching .piracies committed on seas.â
In the delegation of power, the whÂ«le purpose,
in his opinion, is answered, when me rules, by
which the business is to be point
ed out by law :ânor could hedifcover anything
in the constitution, to restrict the house froui
adopting this mode of conducting bufinels.
Mr. Hartley.âl cannot agree with the gentle
man from Mafiachufetts, that as often as thisbu
finefs had been agitated, there had been a majo
rity in the house in favor of leaving it to the ex
ecutive to designate the post-roadsâNay, so far
as my recolleiftion (which is perhaps not so good
as that gentleman's) serves me, we uniformly
have had a majority for Congress to point out
the post-roads.
The Constitution seems to have intended that
we {hotild exercile all the powers respecting the
'eftabli/hing post-roads we are capable of, but
the gentleman fays we are not competent to this
;dutyâthat it must be entrusted to the executive.
Sir, In many questions, concerning the pro
perty or geography of the United States, we had
full information on this floor from every quarter.
The people's interests and circumstances have
been known, however diltinJtly or differently
situated.
On tile fubjedl of the poft-officc there has been
much discussionâalmost the whole of the roads
here stated, have appeared in bills before, and
though the gentleman (who made the motion for
(Inking out) may not perfectly nnderftaird all
the roads, yet ifhe will be so good as to attend
to the gentlemen who represent the different parts
of the Union, he ought to be fatisfied.
Unless they are prejudiced they can certainly
give the best information.
If it was leu to the President or Poft-MafVer-
General, neither is acquainted with all the roads
contemplated, they niult depend in a gr#at de
gree upon the inforiv.ation others.
We reprelent the people, we are conflitution
ally vested with the power of determining upon
the eflrablifhmenj; of pail-roads, and as I under
stand at pre lent, ought not to delegate the pow
er to any other person.

I (hould imagine there ought to be a limitation
of the law in point of time, fay three, four or
five yearsâwhen we come to the proper place a

No one in the United States has a orearer ref
peei for the President than myfelf, and I hold
that the several departments are filled with ~er>
tleiufn of the firlt abilities and fitnefs, but we
are not to confine ourselves to a view of the mo
mentâthis bill has the complexion of a perpetual
law ; we mini have some regard to consequences.
If the amendment takes place the office as
we'll as revenue will be thrown into [he power
ofthe executive, who may iucreafe the roads and
offices as far as the revenues go. The revenue
of the pod office is at present not great, but if
proper feeds are now sown ic may hereafter be
productive.
In Great Britain much has been obtained from
the po!l-o(Iice, and inoitofthe European nations
count upon it as a considerable branch of reve-

Will ic be prudent for us to grant this power
to the executive in the latitude conrended.forâ
we mil ft not suppose that this country will always
remain incorrupt, we fliall lhare the fateofothe-r
nations.
Through the medium of the poft-ofiice a weighty
influence may be obtained by the executive this
is guarded against in England by prohibiting of
ficers in the poll-office department from inter
fering at elections. There is no such guard or
caution in the present bill.
By the amendment we are unnecefiarily part

The Senate heretofore have disagreed with us,
but if they will take the fame pains w'e have,
the means of information is within their reach â
upon a review they may probably change their

This is a law of experiment, let us try it'a'

'â Mr. if. Bourne was 111 favor of the amend

liituticuial.âiÂ» freaking of pofl-officts andpojt
roads, thl;. conftltution, he observed, fpenks in
general terms, as it-does of a mint, excises, &c.
i-c.âJo palling the excise law, the house, not
thinking themlelves pofleffed of fufflcient infor
ination, empowered the President to mark out
the diUriels and surveys : and if they had aright
to delegate such power to the executive, the fur
ther delegation of the power of marking out the
roads for the conveyance of the mail, could
hardly be thought dangerous : the constitution
meant no more than that Congress should poftefs
the exclusive right of doing that, by themselves,
or by any other person, which amounts to the
fame thing : the business he thought much more
likely to.be well executed by the President, or
the Poft-Mafter-GeneraJ, than by Congress. Ke
had himfelf been of the committee who framed
the bill ; but eould not tell whether the roads,
marked outinir, were better than ex
cept so far as relates to the State repre
sents ; and he imagined the other of
the committee were in a similar predicament :
The President, l;e observed, having opportuni
ties of obtaining information from the different
members of the house, from the Post-Master-Ge
neral, and from others, will be more competent
to determine the proper road : it will be occa
sionally neceflary to change the route, and lay
out new roads : and he could fee no inconveni
ence from entrufiing either the President or the
Pofl-Malter-General with the neceflary powers
for these purpofer, :âat all events, the house
could guard againlV any apprehended danger,
by the insertion of such a claufeas had been pro
posed [by Mr. Hartley] limiting the operation of
the bill to three, four or five years : at the expi
ration of that term the power would revert to
Congress, and they might then retain the exer
cise of it in their own hands, if they found that
any improper use had been made of it.
Mr. White made several observations on the
the expediency and constitutionality of the mea
sure. No individual, he said, could poflefs an
equal f,lare of information with that House on
the fubjecft of thegeography of the United States.
He disapproved of the amendment for many
other reaf'ons, and particularly its approximat
ing to the cuflom of England. Such advances
towards monarchy, if not checked in season, he
was apprehensive would tend to unhinge the pre
sent government. If this government retains its
present republican form, it will be owing to the
members of this House. It is easy to fee whathand could be made of the poft-oJKces, if ever
t l, e y are under the direction of an improper
nerfon- At the time of a general election, for
fnftance, liow easy would it be for this man to
dictate to,particular towns and villages, " If you
do not fend such a man to Congrcfs, you ihall
have no poll-office ; bur if you eiec't my friend,
ton shall have a poft-office, and the roads ihall
be run agreeably to your wiflies." Another im
proper use may be made of this power by the
interception of letters, and checking the regular
channel of information throughout the country.
Upon the whole, he w;is clearly for rejecting
the motion for striking out ihe words in the bill.
Ivlr. Lawrance obfeived that the revenues ari
finjr from the poft-office would not, perhaps, pro
duce a fufficient sum to defray the expences of
the eftablifliment : if this should be the tact, he
would prefer the amendment, but if the revenue
should increase from time to time; he should have
no objection to the addition of pods and roads
in proportion to Fuciiincreafe. Ihe consequence
of establishing so exten.five a system all at once,
as was contemplated in the bill, might be, than
the revenue would fall short, and then addition-
al taxes malt be laid to pay off the deficiency :
however, upon the whole, if he could be fatis
ficd that the revenues of the department would
be fufliclent to defray the expences of it, he
would be againlt striking out the clause in the
bill.
Mr. Page.âlf the motion before the comtnittee
succeeds, I (hall, said he, make one which will save
a deal of time & money, by making a'fhort feflion
of u ; for if this house can with propriety leave
t;. business of the poft-office to the President,
ii, ni l;, ieave 10 him any other business of legifta
jion ; and-i may move to adjourn and leave all
the iH-'Ui of legifiation to his sole eonllderation
.-uwl i : : But how the President fliould be
inted with the proper places for poit
. .t roaiis than the representatives of
11 >I cannot conceive : In Virginia, for
ii hi ,\ c'amut the 10 representatives fay with
us.. iin; what pod-roads would be proper
jn i' â¢ Slate than any one man ! I look upon
the motion as unconÃitutional, and if it were
jipt 10, as having a niifchievous tendency, which
1 am willing to believe the member who made it
is not aware of.
In reply to Mr. Sedgwick, he said, he heard
but two arguments on which any ftreis vvr.s laid,
viz. that the Prefidcrit's greater responsibility
pointed him out as the proper person to ba en
trusted with the important business of eftabliih
ing pod offices and post roads, and that his lu
perior knowledge of this business ought to in
duce the committee to leave it to him alone '
tut as -to the responsibility, how that can be !
greater than the responsibility of the memfceis
of this h'onfe, when he is appointed by electors
for it; lcnger term than they areâand they elect
ed by the people themselves, and accountable to
them every two years, is to me inconceivable ; and
as to his fuperi'or knowledge, granting ti'.at he
> J>o(!e(Ted it, which I cannot grant âcan there be a
greater paradox than the alfertion that the Pre
lident's knowledge r.lone, is greater than that
very knowledge aided by the informa
tion of both Houses of Congress, coliecled and
presented to him in the bill Sir, if the clauie
â which it is said we should strike out, faiflead oj
communicating the sense of this house to the
President, took away his right of approving or
rejeiiling itâthere might be some weight in the
is argument drawn from the supposition of his fii
perior knowledgeâ but as this is not, and can
riot be the caie, and so far from it, that the
' clause submits the business to the pioft mature
fc deliberation of the President and Senate ; it
inuft be paradoxical to fay that we lose the ad
vantage of fut erior wisdom and knowledge of
the business, if we do not leave it to the Pi eiioent
aloneâbut we are told that the motion is not
Uliconftittitional :âI think ,it is;âbut who is
there that denies it is contrary to the interest
and spirit of a free government ? The people,
however, may think with the member who
made the motion, that the President (that is,
the man who is now their President) underihmds
this business, and can do it better than their Ke
prefentatives ; and they may think the whole bu
siness of government might be fafely entrusted
to him but they are too wife to make the expe
riment, and understand the nature of their go
vernment so well as to complain that Congress
too often commits to heads of departments what
the conftinuion requires at their hands. The
Present bimfelf. if I mistake not, views the fub
jedt before us in the light 1 do, or he would not
so repeatedly have called on us to make it a pe
culiar object of our deliberation.

FROM THE LEXINGTON (KEN.) GAZETTE.
Copy of a circular letter from Brigadier-General Scott, to the different
County Lieutenants in Kentuckey.
Lexington, November n, 1791.
"si R,
" We have now received certain intelligence that the army have
been defeated. -The very great. The garrison at foij-
Tefferfon is intercepted, and many, many brave wounded 'gallant
men are now left on the road unable to travel, and without any
provision but the flefh of the pack-horles. This cafe requires im
mediate exertions. I have appointed a rendezvous of volunteers
at Craig's Mill, the 15th inft. completely equipped, with arms,
! ammunition, and 20 davs provision. I trust that no exertion on
your part will be wanting, when the fafety of our country, and
the lives of brave men are in danger. The circumdance requires
the greatest difoatch, and no friend to his country can now be idle.
Believe me with refpeft, your's.
* * The volunteers who are not ready by the 15th inft. are to
foHow as soon as poflible."
Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Mercer County, to a member cj
the General Ajjembly, dated, November 13, 1791.
" The defeat of General St. Clair, 011 the 4th inlt. engrofles all
iour though's; we had 600 men killed and wounded, all the ilorcs
;loft, and 7 pieces of artillery. This Engagement happened about
15 miies from the Miami Village, 30 from Fort-Jefferfon, and 98
;from Fort-Washington.
, " General St. Clair expe&ed an action; the men were drawn
(up in order of battle, and (food in their ranks all night, the army
'were formed into a hoilow square, the artillery and baggage in
jthe centreâthe enemy made their attack at the dawn of day on all
;the lin'es, particularly on the rear, which was compofcd of mttitia ;
"they were overpowered and gave way, the Indians rulhed on and
Ifoon were possessed of the artillery, which was retaken in a few
moments by a company of regulars with fixed bayonets, but mod
of the matrofles being killed, no use was made of it; the adtion
continued obstinately till 9 o'clock, when our men gave way.,--
General St. Clair rallied them, and brought off the greater part of
the wounded to Fort-Jefferfon, being pursued about 5 miles,where
the remains of the army and wounded are cooped, almost llarved,
living on poor pack-horses.
" The people of the diftritt are preparing to the relief of
Fort-Jefferfon, and I hope by the 20th, 1000 or 1500 effe&ive
men will be at Fort-Walhington, on their way. Upon this occa
sion, a number of your acquaintances will turn out, in Lincoln,
Logan, Shelby, and Ewing, and Mercer, Col.M'Dowell, and my
felf, with a number of young fellows; we (hall carry provisions
to the garrison, and bring off the wounded."
How various is the scene of human exigence ! âthis has been
said a thousand times; still the course of nature, or which is the
fame, the dispositions of Providence continue from year to year,l
and from age to age, to enforce the solemn remark, that all sublu
nary things are vain.
How often are our fondeft expectations blafled, our brightest
profpe6U overcast with (hades!âand true it is that the best ar
rangements, and the calculations of the wisest among men, are
susceptible of the moil grievous disappointments. _
The Aflumption of the State Debts, (fays a New-York paper of
the 2d inft.) was amongst the wisest measures of the late Congress;
even those who formerly thought it an exceptionable aÂ£f, now ap
prove of it, because they have ft en the good consequences flowing
from it, and they now k join with its former advocates in lament
ing that the opposition made to it was the cause of its being left
incomplete. Had the sum been allumed which was originally
reported by the Secretary of the Treasury, as the amount of the
dehts of tht several states, nothing more than justice would have
been done, and some time would have been saved to the prefenc
Congress, who will undoubtedly be disposed to follow the liberal
and just example of their predeceflors, and compleat that which
peculiar circumstances left unfinifhed on a former occasion.
Wednesday the House of Representatives proceeded to the
choice of a Speaker, and upon counting the votes, it appeared that
the honorable William Bingham, Esq. was unanimously
ele&cd.âOn Thursday the house proceeded to the choice of their
other officers.
