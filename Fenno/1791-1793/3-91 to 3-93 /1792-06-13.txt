from among us, it be iccominended 1.0 all persons
whofc situation may have brought them into ac
quaintance with any such ta& to communicate the
lame by letter addrefled to Thomas Jefferfbh,
Efcj. Secretary of State to the United States.
And that the proper obje&s of inquiry and in
formation may he more particularly pointed out,
the following QuciVions arc proposed.
Section 1. Inwhatyear, snd at â what time
of the year, was th s animal observed for the firft
time ? Does it fecm to have made its appearance in
this country only of late years, or are there any
reasons for supposing that it was known in any
part of the United Slates previously to the com
rnencemcni of the late revolution ?
Sec. 2. At what time ol the year has this infeÂ£l
beenobferved in the Egg-State ? At what time in
the Worm-State ? And at what t ime in the Fly-
State ? How long does it remain in each of these
several states ? Does it pass through more than one
generation in the course of a year ? If it docs,
which generation of the infc.dt is it that proves moit
injurious ?
Sec. 3. What kind of Wheat does this infeÂ£i
prove most injurious to ? Has it ever been fecn on,
or has it proved dcftruflive to,'the Spelts ? Does
it ever injure the roots of the wheat, &c ? Has it
ever been fecn in the flowers ? Docs it afFtdl the
leaves ? What part of ihe stalk is it chiefly con
lined to ? Has ii ever been known to attack the
grain, or to be 1 rani ported with it ? In what man
ner docs it seem to operate its injurious effects ?
At what season are these effects firft observed to
commence ?
Sec. 4. Does it ever injure the Spring-wheat,
the Barley, the Buck-wheat, and the Oats ? Does
it injure the Rye or the Indian-corn ? It it does,
on what part of these several vegetables does it
chiefly reside ? Dots it inhabit any of the Grasses,
or other.{mailer vegetables, which v e cultivate in
our fields, our meadows, gaidens, &c ? I fit does,
what aie the names of these grafTes, See ? And on
what parts of these vegetables does it chiefly re
10
frde ? llds it ever been obferve-d, in any of its fta-.
pes, iu their flowers ? Has it ever been known to
â¢jure their feeds ? Does it appear so be molt 'de
tiru6tivc to the grades, See. of the more wet, or to
ihofc of the more dry, (oils ? Has it ever been ob
served upon any of. the larger trees or (hrubsof the
forcil, garden, &c ? If it has, what are the names
of these trees and shrubs ? And what paits ol ihcm
does it commonly aftcft ?
Sec. 5. Does this infeÂ£l seem to havecommitted
depredations on the different grains, but
particularly on the wheat, when sown in one foil
th?n when sown in another ? Thus, for inlfance,
u it ascertained whether this animal has proved
mod deftruttive to wheat which has been sown in
a light artd loose foil, or to that which has been
(own in a fliong and heavy foil ? Do its ravages,
anpear to have been greater or less upon the wheat j
of land which has been recently manured, than
upon the wheat of laud that has never been manu
red stall, or which has not been manured for a
eonfiderable lengih of time ? N. B. All the que
ries of this fettion have alfoa reference to the Rye,
the Oats, the Barley, &c.
Sec. 6. How far has ihÂ» Bearded.-wheat efca
pcd the injuries of this infeffc ? Which variety of
'he Bearded-wheat, the Yellow, the Red, or the
White, has Keen observed to be most exempt from
its injuries ? Has any variety or species of the
: heat entirely escaped the ravages of this infect ?
Sec. 7. Is it pofliblj to afcertain,with'any degree
of Certainty, extent of country which this inftÂ£l
has fravcrfed in a year, or in any other pe
riod of time ? Are iis movements rapid ? Does
it appear that the progress of the infeÂ£l has been,
in any degree, retarded, or obftrufteel, bv rivers,
by mountains, See ? Does it appear that it has pur
sued any general or fixed rou'e through those coun
tries, in which it has b<*en observed, as to the
North, the South, &c ? How far to the North has
it been observed ; How far to the South ? How
Jar to Weft ?
Sec. 8. Have any experiments been made to
demonstrate the degree oi cold which this infect,
in the different stages of its existence, is capable of
supporting ? Is it food for other animals P
Sec. 9. What means have been found most fuc
cefsful for preventing the injuries committed by
this infect,? How t<ir has the prattice of rolling
the wheat and the rye in the autumn and in the
faring been found of service ? Have any good con
fequenccs rdulted from the pra&ice of feeding the
grain close in the spring time ? Has the pra&ice of
â steeping the grain of the wheat, &c. (previously
to its being sown) in infufions of the Elder, and of
other vegetables, found of any fetvice ?
And while the committee alk, with earncftnefs,
information from every person who can answer
anyone or more of the preceding questions, ihey
address themfclves in a peculiar manner lo those
on whose farms this iÂ»(eÂ£t has appeared, praying
that they will give them fnCli details as thev cah
give with certainty, regardlels of the style or form
of theircommunications, since it will be the duty
of the committre to reduce all the faCts receivea
from different pcrfons' into ail <?rdeily narrative,

REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION.
Concerning the mavufaElures of the United States, ai
they ajfect the mercantile itterefi.
MANY of the Ihip holders and merchants
trading with foreign countries, suppose,
but it is believed erroneously, that they have
no interell in the promotion of manufactures.
It is known that Great Britain with seventy
millions of acres of cultivated land, (hips four
teen millions (her whole exports being near
twenty millions) in her own maunfaCtures.
The foreign trade of that kingdom, without
manufactures, would manifeftly be neither so
great nor so variousâfor the value of the pro
duce manufactured is increased from one hun
dred to ten hundred per cent, as is also that of
the imported raw materials, which constitute
a great portion of their trade. The foreign
commerce of the United States, is already enli
vened by manufactures. Ships, boats, oars,and
handspikes, bar iron, steel, nail rods, carriages
of ail kinds, hats, (hoes, cordage, candles, soap,
oils of several kinds, starch, hair powder, dif
tilfcd spirits, malt liqnors, cabinet ware, plate,
puncheon packs, gunpowder, potashes, bricks,
chocolate, mustard, tow linens, fail cloth, pot
ter's ware, fadlery and harnei's, wool and cot
ton cards, paper and paper hangings, tanned
leather, books, fnutf, manufactured tobacco,
and iron manufactures are now frequently ex
ported to foreign countries. Coaftwifc there
is alfp a great trade in these and many other
manufactured articles, and in raw materials
and provisions for the manufacturers within the
United States.
An argument of great importance to the Ihip 1
holder?, exporters, and underwriters, and, in
deed to the cultivators of the earth, in support
' of manufactures is to he drawn from their ten- 1
dejicy to promote in an easy, certain, fafe, and
cheap way, the naval capacities and strength
of the United States. The transportation ,of
provilions, coal, raw materials, and otlier arti
cles from the and middle states to the
northern, and the of the niamifadtures,
FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.
(continued.)
[Whole No. 526.]
to the towns on the coast, througout the union,
already employs many veifels. The rice, indi
go, cotton, hemp, flax, iron, hides, furs, tar,
pitch, turpentine, rozin, wax, tobacco, wood
and timber, flour and grain, (hipped from the
states, on, and to the southward of* the Che fa
peak. for the manufacturers in the middle and
northern states, give employment at this time
to a very refpe&able portion of our tonnage.
This cannot be doubted, when it is remember
ed that our coasters are I io,oo:> tons, though
our veflels in all the foreign trades probably do
not much exceed tons; and the for
mer are entirely out of the reach of foreign re
ftri<ftions,confequently (with tbe fifliing veflels)
are our most certain dependence. The'weight
of this circumstance, will be not a little increas
ed by the recollection that the coasting trade is
uncommonly interesting to a nation without
transmarine colonies or dominions.
When we consider the filheries as one of thÂ«
modes of creating the powers of offence and
defence at sea, and that our agriculture and
commerce, must therefore be supported and de
fended by our fiftiermen, and fifhing veiTels, a
mong other means, it will be fatisfactory to the
cultivators, and merchants, that they will be
promoted by the success of our manufactures.
Skins and furs of sea animals, whalebone, and
the head matter of the whale, are used by vari
ous manufacturers for leather, hats, whips,can*
dies, &:c. The oils are used by leather drelf
ers, shipbuilders, &:c. andinftead of candles.
It will be unneceflarv to adduce to our mer
cantile citizens any arguments to prove, that
the United States generally pay a premium on
the bills purthafed for their remittances for
European manufactures. The exports, sales
of veiTels, their outward freights and the sales
of lands, to foreigners, are the ordinary means
applied to the payments for our imports, after
deducting that part of them which,
to the emigrators, is not to be remittedor paid
for. It is interesting to ascertain the reasons
for our continuing to lose by the course of ex
change. The principal cause probably is, that
we draw so very large a proportion of our ma
nufactures from one nation, that there is con
stantly h double demand for bills on that coun
try. It is of importance to discover how this
is to be remedied. The other Europeans rations
have had the eight \ears of the war almojl exclu/ively
and the vine yean of the pcace in a fair competition and
do not fuppiy us zoith minufailure* equivalent to half of
the Jlatcd value of the shoes made by ourjelves /It ap
pears then, that our own exertion \ only, can re
lieve our merchants from this annual loss, on
their remittances forfeveral millions of dollars.
It may not be improper to take a view of the
article of distilled spirits as a commodity which
we are capable of manufacturing to any extent,
and which will be an aid to agriculture, and an
object of coasting and foreign trade. We have
imported, in a finale year, above eleven milli
ons of gallons of foreign spirits and moUfles.
If one million of gallons of the latter used
in substance, then our imports of spirits and in
j gredients made into spirits, would stand at ten
millions of gallons. The value of thele, as they
cost the country may be fairly taken at one
third of a dollar on a medium, and will give
3*333*333 dollars, which is above one sixth
part of the annual value of our exports. As
five millions of bulhels Qf grain would be con
sumed in the manufa&ory of a quantity of spi
rits equal to what was imported, in the form
of spirits or ingredients employed to make them,
there is no occasion for argument to prove, thati
the lavdediniertji would be benefited by the ma
nufacture of grain liquors (or fruit liquors) in
lieu of tiie ten millions of gallons drawn from
Foreign sources. And in regard to the mercantile
ivterrjl, it may be observed, that the supply of a
foreign conynodity is always precarious, and
accordingly the disturbances in the several parts
ot the French empire, and the loss of their vin
tage, have deprived us of the usual importation
of their brandies since the last: autumn, and of
the accustomed supply of molasses from the crop
of 1792 of their principal colony. Thcfe two
defalcations will probably amount to some mil
lions of gallons, and must produce a void in a
confidcrable branch of our foreign trade, for
we shall not have it in our power to import the
brandies and molafTes, nor to export the returns
for them, which have employed many thousand
tons of shipping, and a considerable part of our
mercantile capital and industry ; nor shall we
be able to export diftilicd spirits, manufactured
from molasses, which has also employed our
vessels, private funds and industry. How are
the merchant and snip holder to be relieved unr
der these injuries to their business ? Manufac-*
turing distilled spirits and malt liquors from na
tive materials will afford considerable relief.
Their capital and vessels mav be employed in
purchasing and tranfportingfrom the rivers and
bays of the United States-to the distilleries and
breweries a part at least of the requisite quan
tities of grain, hops, fuel, and lumber, and of
the manufactured liquors to domefticor foreign
markets. Nor is this a* mere probability. It
is already an 1 existing fact. The manufacture
of grain liquors in the town of Providence (in
Rhode Ifland).alone, in the firft three months of
the prefentyear, was equivalent to 12,056 caÂ£>
es of geneva per annum. If the Dutch import
grain from the north of Europe, to make and
diftributegin from Archangel to Canton, whichis really the cafe, it cannot be doubted that the
United States, which have the greateit surplus
of grain of any country upon earth, which art
rapidly increafmg it, Vine a are farther from
their conlumers than any nationexportinggrain,
which have the lumber to make toe cajks for
it, and tie flipping t > transport it, and are
themfe've; great consumers of malt liquors and
distilled fpirii:;, it cannot be doubted t::at a na
tion thus circiimikanced, mutt be able to iiunu
fafture thoie articles with facility and advan
tage to any extent of the demand. The be le
fits to foreign trade fr >m the manufa&uie of
ships, cordage, fail cloth, and anchors, as necei
fary inicruments, and from those articles and
potall*, soap, candles, fleel, carriages and other
articles, for sale to foreigners here, or as pay
ments or remittances to them abroad are al
ready too obvious to need mor<* than to be enu
merated : but too much attention cannot be
given to our situation, qualifications, and prof
pefts in regard to the home manufacture of li
quors, conSdering the diilurbed state of the su

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES,
r r*H AT the cause oft uthwill not differ from
X a free difcuflion, is an ufefai and important
maxim. But, like maxims in general, it liiiili
be understood only in a limited sense. Its firlt
cftablifhment Teems to have arisen from a lau
dable delign of discouraging the Interpoiition of
civil and ecclesiastic power in matters of opinion.
Such interpoiition no doubt tends to retard the
progress of know ledge, and exclude improve
ment from the world. But supposing fuii liber
ty to {peak and write on every fubje&j it ap
pears obvious from the situation in which man
kind mutt forever exist, and from the immuta
ble and vaÂ« ions fir u<slure of their mind-, and
the principles of their hearts, that this liberty
may be used in a way unfavorable, at leall for
a time, to the cause of truthâand that a difcuf
flon in this sense free, may take place, by which
error shall be propagated. Were all men en
dued with the penetrating under (landings, and
did all poilefs the acquired knowledge of the
l\ezvtons and Lockes of our species, and were all
equally capable as they of separating error from
truthâwere we especially all free from thebiafs
and irapetuofity of paflion, the preceding maxim
would be more But while man
kind in general are far inferior to individuals
in mental faculties and treasures ; a few of the
latter may, and the more artful and a&ivethev
are, the more fuccefsfully, abuse their fnperio
rity to the delusion of multitudes. While the
pallions have so much power in the human
breast, thole opinions which flatter the -indul
gence of them, will be propagated with pecu
liar facility. Besides, from a variety of cir
cumstances, as the inattention and silence of her
fiends, in some instances from their inferior
abilities, and frequently from their iuferior
wealth, rank, power or fame, &c. Truth mav
remain unfupporled on the field of battle â¢ all
her forces may not be brought forward, or the
contefl be decided more from some accidental
circuaifcances, t. an the real lirength of the

Tnefe reflexions are genera!, and will apply
to any time p.rd any fubjeft. There is, how
ever", a particu :ir propriety. in bringing them
forward to public attention at present, when
eriois and vices are rapidly imported from Eu

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
I THURSDAY, APRIL 19, 1792.
On the motion to enhance the duty on
imported hemp and cordage, and to
Jirtke out imported cotton from articles
i exempted from duty.
MR. BOURNE (aid he hoped this
encreaf# would not be agreed
toâthe navigation of the United
States would fuffer by itâas the sup
ply furni/hed by the cultivation of
that article, was not competent to tht
demand.
Mr. White said that on the princi
ple of uniformity, he thought this
fluty ought to be rpifed ; but when
it is considered that many of the du
ties are defigncd to encourage the
manufactures of the United Stares, he
thought that equal attention fliould
be paid to the agricultural interellv
an interell as important as any other
at lealt.
Mr. Willianifon fnpported the
amendmentâ he said the indepen
dence of rlie United States, in refpetft
to its navioarioii, was so important an
ohjeifi, that lie conceived every thiiio
ought to be dene to effeift it. Among
others, proper encouragement (hould
be given to the railing of hemp, efpe
ciaily vhen it is cojilidered tiiac we
have a grearer proportion of land
than any other countryâthat expe
i iments have proved that it can be
raiferf to advantage , that it will, if
duly encouraged, conduce to rooting
out the cultivation of tobacco, which
impoverifi)e S the foil, a âd is a mere
aitiele of luxury. He was at a lois
to account for the omiflion of this
duty in the firft inftttifce.
Mr. Parker fnpponed the amend-
Ce,lh " gedon the good policy
(â¢ r' g IIIIS encoura gementâlie
(aid jf the gentleman who moves to
diJagree to ihe amendment had pro
posed to reduce the duty op canvas
he thought it would be more confill
ent; and in this cafe he fhnuld be
willing to relinqui/h this enhanced
duty on hemp.
Mr. Goodhue said he fiiould agree
o the enhanced duty. j
11
' Mr. Lawrance nppofed if, princi
pally on account of its being a tax on
a raw material, and a very essential
:oÂ«e too 'O the navigation and com
merce of the United States.
Mr. Mfdifon offered some remarks
in favor of the enhanced duty.
The amendment was agreed to.â
Foreign cotton being inserted among
the anicles to be exempted from duty.
Mr. macon moved that it (hould be
tltruck out âhe thought it belt that
the duty lhould becontinued. Great
quantities, he ("aid, were raised in the
louthem Hate's, for which they could
not find a market.
Mr. Anics opposed the motionâlie
said there were manufactures carried
on in the United States which requir
ed foreign cottonâfoine things con Id
not be manufactured without cbtton
of a particular (ta-ple. He further re
marked, that the enconragement to
the railing of cotton depends on the
manufactures formed from itâhence
he inferred that this very encourage
ment is suspended on a due attention
to the manufactures.
Mr. Steele dated sundry particulars
to (hew that the cotton raised in the
southern dates was adapted to every
species of manufatfures; and de
pending on encouragement froiÂ» go
vernment, the farmers of North-Ca
rolina had gone largely inro the cul
tivation of that article. It is well
known, said he, that the fttuation of
the three fouiibtrn dates is fa-vorable
to the raising of hemp and cottonâ
and on the principles of reciprocity,
be thought it but just and equal to
extend encouragement to the agri
cultural interest of tbofe dates.
Mr. Baldwin observed that be could
have wifned the gentleman had nien
tioned the particular fnecies of cot
ton which was so necessary in the ma
nufactures, that could not be procur
ed from the fonthern staves. Hefaid
that there were two forts of cotton
raited there ; one of a fliort, the other
of a long daple ; and under due en
couragement, they would in a few
years raise every description of that
article.
Mr. Fitzfitnons, Mr. Murray and
Mr. Kittera, fupportejl the motion
for driking out the article.
Mr. Page, in favor of the dury,
observed, thai the gentleman (Mr.
Ames) who had exprelied his fears
that American cotton would not suit
the manufacturers, might lay aside
his fears ; for he knew from experi
ence the contraryâthat even if what
had been said of the cotton of the
United States were true, he knew
that there was reason to believe that
the cotton of the Weft and East-in
dies would grow even in Virginia
that both had been lately introduced
into that slate. Such feats, he said,
might upon examination perhaps be
traced to the fame origin with Come
formerly introduced into Virginia
that the flieep of America wci e only
ufefnl as food, their wool being; unfit
for the woollen manufactui e. He
added that he well remembered it
was with difficulty lome people were
convinced that the fait water of Ame
rica would yield fait. He said, for
his part, he fhoukt as easily be per
luaded that the fifh of the United
Stales wei e unfit for food, and as in
capable of being cured so as to be
merchantable, as that the cotton of
America was unfit for the cotton ma
nufactories; he thereforeadvifed the
worthy member to be upon his guai d
againlU'uch inlinuations. As to him
felf, Mr. Page declared he had no
idea that any member of either House
could wiili to injure the of
any of the Itates ; but he said he was
authoi ifed to fuppole that as the ma
nufacturers in general were foreign
os, they had their prepofteflions and
prejudices, which might give rife to
tiie opinions entertained by some gen
tiemcn respecting the unfunels of our
cotton forntar.ufrftfure; but header
ed that whatever gave rile to them
they were ill founded, as he had
ofien seen and worn in the late war
cotton cloth and Tickings, as good
and fine as ever had been imponeg.
As to encouraging the manufactures
..ouever, said he, I have ever thought
it foreign to the bulinefs of Congress,
and if not so, a mere taking from one
" an *L n ? g' v 'Â»g to anotherâa deli
cate affair, which might be mifunder
;tood and ir.ifappliedâhowever, as it
is thrown in before us, I take
(hare for my conflituents,
As to tlie fears of the member from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Kittera) that the
culture of cotton may injure the far
mer, Mr. Page said he could afi'ure
him that he had found cotton a j;ood
preparative for whear, and that lands
where lie lived, which had been worn
out in tobacco, yielded excellent cot
ton, and left the ground in fine order
for wheat, and that cotton, if proper
ly encouraged, would be a good sub-
II it in e for tobacco. >

LONDON, March 1
G F. R M A N Y
The Elector of Mentz,' as Great
Chancellor of-the Empire, will iflue
summonses to ihe Electors, within a
niOnili. and the day fixed for the elec
tion of an Emperor, niuft be within
three months of that time. The cir
jomittance of the late Emperor's foil
not being elected King of the Romans
during iiis lather's life lime will not
obftrnrt his eletfion as has been sup
posed. The cafe has happened fre
quently.
When the throne becomes vacant
by the death of the reigning Empe
ror, and no King of the Romans has
been previonfly ch.'fen, the Eleiftor
Palatine, and Elector of Saxony, have
the title of Vicat s of the Empire, in
right of their refpetflivc offices ; the
one of Count Palatine, the other of
Arch-Marshal of the Empire. The
Emperor, ku his capitulation, con
stantly engages to ratify and confirm,
iu the fulleft manner pofliblc all ai r ts
performed by the Vicars General,
during the time of the interreguuui..
Though the Empire be elective,
vet it is so rather in words rlian in
faÂ«sl. From the time that Albert 11.
of the House of Austria, was rhofen
Emperor in 14:8, ihe Icnjieiial tligi li
;y has continued in the House of Au
stria, in which the order of primo
geniture has always determined the
Electors.
With regard to the King of the
Romans (which, by the bye, is a mere
title) it he is chosen before the cie
inife of the Emperor, he succeeds to
the Empire without any other elec
tion ; if not he has all the forms to
go through, and though requiring
time, yet they are founded upon rules
from which there is seldom any va-
nation
It is a miflake ro suppose that
firings for tlie flioes are a modern in
vention. The Beaux of Sr. Bartho
lomew's and Bridewell hospitals liave
worn them time out of mind ; and
that they were fafhionable when But>-

the following diliich iÂ« his addreii

mirable composition allows our fa
vourite an opportunity of crowding
the varieties of her exprcflion into a

countenance and action may at oncf
be comprehended at a lingle view.
; Great Britain is now flourifliing in
arts and connnercc, and Vcsping' lb*
fruits both of her own industry and

In this elevation of fortune, and ex*
icrnal fecuriry, it will be political
wisdom to guard against these inter
nal paflions, which excels of profpe
riiy is wonr to generate. It will b#
wisdom to anticipate, by partial and
gradual reformation,thofe evils which
might orherwife arifefroni a general
convulsion. The molt brilliant gc*

House of Commons, are botli equally
pledged to do every thing in then

formation. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox

nation.
It was well remarked, as is okferv
ed by an able and jadicious friend to
civil ami religious liberty, by Mr.
Fox, " that not only the established

1 freedom, is to make poverty their choice, and
to fiv they had rather be loaded with taxes than'
not. If such a cafe could be proved, it would
equally prove that those who govern are not fit
to govern them, for they are a part of the fame

OH LA!
By the Sand ".rich Packet, Capt. Dillon, de-
rived at Ncw-York, account > are received from
Europe to the 26th of Aprilâ-they itats that
the National Allembly has accorded with the
general anticipation, by palling a decree in the
fitting of Friday antecedent to the 26th oi April,
which fanftions the hcfftilities ot Fiance with
the king of Bohemia and Hungary âand thac a
j deputation of twenty-four members Ihould carry
| the Decree to -the King for his fanCtion.
A correspondent informs uthat at a late
meeting of thfe fubicfibei/s to the Universal 1 on- 4
tine, the principles of the inft'-tution were fully
ancj fairly difculied ; and it appeared t : it, not
withstanding the late pecuniary dtiiÂ»culcies,'near
ten thousand /hares had been fubiCribed in-t.ri*
city, exclusively of a number ot fiiafes disposed
of by one of the agents in other states; and that
there was a reafonabie pro<~pe& that the society
u<6uld be loon eftabliflied upon an exteniive, a
permanent, and benefichl foundation. The
aftiount of ihe depofitshad been velteri in fix per
cent, frock, at an advantageous price ; and the
agent employed to chfpole of ihare; in other
rftates, had given ample security for the iaithtul
ciifcharge of his trult. It is to be expected, that
a very rapid fubfeription will take place bet jre
the Ift of July next, as after that day, the de
polit is encrcafed ten cents in each share.
Those who are acquainted with the principles
and objects of this Tontine, cannot but recom
mend it to all persons who are Wefirous ot lecur
ing an independence for thcrnfeives, or their
children. The state of the fubferiptions is for
tunately such, as to preclude the idea of its be
ing a fabjeft of speculation, the fubferibers in
general meaning to retain their interests in the
society; and as the articles declare that, at all
events, the number of {hares fubicribed on the
Ift of January next, fnall constitute tie capital
of the Tontine, there can be no pollibility of a
premature diifolution of the Company.
