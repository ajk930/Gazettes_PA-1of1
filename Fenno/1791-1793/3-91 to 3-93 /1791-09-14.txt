FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER.
Reflections relative to the Stock of the Bank of the
United States, and to the National Funds.
ALTHOUGH the debt of the United States has been among the
circumstances, which have inclined the mindsof individuals
to tne continuan-e of (he union, yet it fecms difficult to demon
ftraie, that a public debt is so far a public blefling as to render i\ â 
existence of such a demand upon a nation lucrative and defirab e
in a pecuniary sense. It is however certain, that it is actually pr< -
friable to a people to evinre a real ability and a sincere difpofitic 1
to d'feharge such debts as they may have been obliged to .
The advantages which a trader (or a nation) gains by a pertettcr -
dit, re sting upon his hone ft y and foliJitv, need not be dwelt upon*
It is happy for this country, that all its citizens perceive the ad
vantages of the recent restoration of public and private credit,
arising from covjlitutions and laws enforcingjuftice, banishing paper
tenders and other violations of the rights of property, and inveit
ing the general government with powers better adapted to the at
tainment of national fafety, order and prosperity. The impulses
to industry and economy, resulting from a conviÂ£lion that the pay
ment of honest debts is no longer to be procrastinated, and from
J the acquisition of a government able and desirous to preserve to
every man the fruits of his labour, have operated to produccunpre
cedented exports. These abundant productions (hipped to fo
reign markets, procure copious supplies of necessaries, and upon
terms, generally speaking, much more favorable to the consumer
than heretofore. The concurrence of these circumstances has ren
dered our country and its business and public funds, more invit
ing to judicious and monied foreigners. One species of property
after another has, and will continue to feel the spring given by
their cash, and the rich and cautious part of our citizens, who had
nnder the lot mer constitutions and laws too frequent occasions to
complain, have been tempted to bring their money once more in
to the business of the country. These are the precious cffe&s at
home of hontfl policy. Abroad they are no less fatisfadlory and
undeniable. Among the most wary people of Europe, loans have
been negociated upon terms as favorable as those which have been
made for the mod punctual, wealthy, and best accredited nations
of the old world.
In this date of things it would have been extraordinary if, the
funds of the United States, and of the institutions conneded with
their affairs and colnmerce,*had not risen to their natural and in
trinsic value.
Hence the rife of the price at -which our public debt has been
fold in the market, hence too the demand which has appeared for
the stock of the bank of the United States. If these (and particu
larly the latter) have been suddenly and strangely operated upon,
it is partly owing to the quickness of action which sudden transi
tions from distress and disorder to great profpcritv generally pro
duce in nations and individuals. It is believed however, that the
liifagreeable fiu6tif9f*?>ns which have taken plac in a small degree
in regard to the d*bt, and so strikingly in rhe c_f of the Bank
Script, have been occafioncd at leafl in part, by the want of the
[wceflarv knowledge among a very large number of the public
creditors and stockholders. The intention of this paper is not
to set a going any too lively movements on thcfc fubjetts, fluctu
ations in which,are to be regretted on public and private confide -
rations, but to contribute towards the prevention of them in fu
ture, by recalling or communicating relative fadt?, which are for
gotten or unknown.
With refpeft to the Bank Script, it is remembered, that compa
risons of the U. S. bank flock with that of the bank of England,
have been made in detail and in figures, which piaccd Script at
315 dollars. Prudent men made large deductions from that
price, because it was known, that money is yet more valuable in
America than in Europe; because the certificate part of the bank
Itock is liable to be paid off in inftallments,and because our bank
is not like that of England, a monopoly. These confederations,
however, ought not to have reduced it down to the prices, which
were lalked of, which will be fatisfaÂ£lorily manifefted by advert
ing to the nature of the stock of the bank of England. The funds
of that institution are wholly made up cf the three per cent, debt
of Great Britain, and areas follows :
Purchased of the South Sea Company,
On their original fund reduced in the year 1743, 3*200,000
For cancelling exchequer bills, 3d year Geo. lit.
Annuities of the year 1714,
Do. 1719*
Do. i74^Â»
Sterling, Â£. 11.686,800
which includes the capital, being Â£*.10,780,000 fterlmg, and afurplus
undivided, 0fÂ£*.906,800 sterling. On the credit of this mafsof
public paper, all of which is at only three per cent, tho lawful in
t< reft is at 5 per cent, do they deprnd in their operations ; that is,
aII their Jlock is two percent, worje than money. On the other
hand, all the Jlock of the bank of the United States is 111 money, or in
public stock better than money, because the interest is paid quar
terly, and '.he pricc in the market is actually above par. What the
t-xcefs beyond par for fix percent, (lock ought to be, will not be
considered here. It is not. to be forgotten, that the bank of the
United States may take fix per cent, interest on its loans, and that
the bank of England can only take Jive percent. The stock of the
American bank,as far as fix-tenths, is in public debt yielding twice
the rare of interest drawn on the public debt belonging to the
JEnglith bank; so that five millions of the certificates of the bank
of the United States (or half'ns stock) will produce to it as great a
proportionate inteicft as if its whole funds were on an interest
Â«4)uhl to the English certificates, and the interest of one million of
fix per ccnts. and the use of lour millions of fpccie, are left as the
Juperior advantage to our ivjlitutitw. This fulid and undeniable
vantage has not been taken into any eftimatc that has been exhi
bited ; and (hough it is not infilled that it ought to run script up
to 315 dollars, yet it proves it to be more valuable than nas been
generally supposed.
It is very interfiling to fettle the opinion of the value of the
Jjocks, or debt of the United Slates. Our loans abroad, which
yield the foreign lender precifcly Jive percent, prove that they
might as well purchase at in the pound, were it not for the
commissions and distance. fiut the European interrft.is only
paid annually, and in America it is difchargcd quarterly. Again
âÂ«the conilwution and laws have given perfect tecurity to private
loans by citizens and foreignersâthe fubferiptions to every bank
in the United States are now filled, and other cireumftances pro
nsife the reduction of the euftomary interest. A reduction of an
unit p?r cent, would add to the value of the fix per cents,
were tVjsy irredeemable. The intercit of money on private con
tract is paid less min&uallv and with trouble, and cannot be dr
manded but once per annumâthe dividends of the banks arc paid
ha/J yearly, but the public funds give their owncis the convenience
ju.d profit of quarterly payments. Four per cent. funds in Eu
rope are worth about 1001. in their markets, which mult by
comparison raise our fix per cent, flocks in the eltnnation of fo
reigners. It is a very encourag ng new cir_umflance too, tha
Â»iy placing our debt onthe public books, the injurious and alarm
ng consequences of counterfeits are done away, furtherâif the
fix per cent, stocks are compared with ground rents, formerly
fold at 20 years purchase, though they were difficult to collect an
nually, and if we remember that in some parts of America money
could not be easily placed in punClual hands at fix per cent, and
that, in one or two States, more than five per cent, could not
have been obtained with good lecunty and quarterly intercit, wi
(h II perceive thji the fix per cent, llock is an inviting- objeCt,
- ven to our own citizens, and will not Suffer on comparing it
with the productivenessof matured real estate. The quality of
eajy convertibility into cajk, at any moment, must recommend it
to 1 he attention of the vigilant and cnterprifing capitalilt.
It is really not desired to renew by these observations the too
lively feelings of the holders of the public debt or bank script.
The objeCts in view are to give relative faCts, on which, in com
bination with other proper confederations, sober-minded men
may ground fafe and fail calculations, and to prove to
whose feelings may have been pained at the appearances of Sport
ing in thefunds and bank flock, that there are faCts and circum
stances in extenuation and explanation of the events, many 01
some of which may have been forgotten or unknown. The pub
lic Satisfaction, and the reputation and ctedit of the country in
Europe may be promoted perhaps by explanations and remarks
as candid and true as these are intended to be. By a perfect un
derstanding Â«f the SubjeCt, it is believed, that a greater degree ol
(lability may be given tothe several species of the national paper.
To fix the debt at a steady value, is perhaps the mod desirable
point in finance we have now to accomplish ; bccaufe an imme
diate and certain consequence will be, the frequent application of
the funds in purchases, which will relieve the incumbered own
ers of real estate and benefit all others. In the mean tyrce, it must
vield them the greatest Satisfaction that the public credit has been
regained, and Supported without the imposition of the smallest
buiden on their property. The rife of the funds has already oc
casioned money to be so plenty as to fill the several banks in Bos
ton, New-York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. This will pre
vent the further application of the private monies of foreigners
and citizens in that way, which must now be applied to build
houses, improve farms, purchase lands in the fettled and unfet
ib d counties, or will be employed in loans to individuals. A
good mortgage law, and thefubjr fling of real cjluteto execution for debt,
in any State, wherein it is Jo liable, will make money plenty,
and easily attainable on private Security.
It is not difficult to create great accommodations to trade by
means of the public debt. The new bank is a proof of if. A
very copious stock has been created by it. The experiment is not
new, having been fuccefsfully tried in England and Ireland. The
old bank of North America has virtually adopted the measure,
by laying out one fifth ot its capital in purchasing the public
debt. An insurance company might easily be eftabbfhed upon
it, and they might extend their operations to very convenient
loans on bottomry and refpondentia. We pay heavy sums for
insurance, and various kinds of mercantile credit to foreigners,
who consider it often as a favor. It is plain, that the more we
can trade on our own funds and institutions, the more freely we
can operate and enterprize, and the better terms can we com
mand in the credits we may afterwards incline to take abroad.
We also perceive, that the debt and the money made by it can
and will be applied to promote manufactures. The want of
capital has, more than any thing else, hitherto impeded this
branch of trade. A considerable fund is already fubfciibed â the
most precious European machineiy is now made, or making by
means of that fundâartifans of very considerable talents from a
broad are engaged, and a foundation is laid tor a fuccefsful ex
emplification of the powers and capacity of this country in the
economizing and lucrative bufiuefs of manufactures.
Let then the candid and serious take a careful "iew of the us -
ful purposes to which the public funds of the United States may
be appliedâlet those who think that too much profit has anfen
to the purchasers, remember, that the public pays not a dollar
more on that and that the country is profiting of its cre
dit at home and abioadâand above all, let serious mouied men
refle6>, that during thetime when pnees were the most fluctuating
the ability of the United States, the produCtiveness of theafligned
rr venues, and the prosperity of the country were as preat as a?
any moment before, and consequently the intrivfic value of
the public debt and bank Jlock was as fixed and solid, as ij no fluctua
tions had occurred.

A Friend to Sobtr Dialing and Public Credit
HAVING accidentally heard that Dr. Parry, an ingenious
phyfictan at Bath, had d'feovered a method of suspending
madness for a fhnrt time, we determined to mention it in ou
journal ; but wishing, as far as in our power not to convey any in
telligence to the public, but what is authentic, we wrote to Dr.
Parry on the fubj?Â£t, and have received the following anfvrer :
TO THE EDITOR OF THE ANALYTICAL REVIEW.
S I R,
IT is now a year and an half, fmcc, from circumflances, o'
analogy, I dif overed a method of suspending, in many indanres,
mania, head aeh, vertigo, convulsions and hyflerical complaints
by a mechanical operation. The method I allude to is (lopping,
by means of the fingers or thumbs, one 01 both of the common
trunks of the carotcd * arteries. Where the paroxvfm is recent,
this method generally succeeds almost mftantanroufly like magic ,
and the symptoms dtfappear as long as the prefTure is continued,
but, for the raoft part, immediately return as soon as it is removed
I cat,not now relate to you all the confcquences of its operation :
but I may obfei ve, in g neral, that it has led me to a pra&ice in
the disorders which I have mentioned, particularly those called
nervous, which is totally oppofuc to that commonly employed,
and infinitely more fuccefsful.
It is my intention to enlarge something more on this fubjrft in
a paper which I mean to prepare, either for one of the m<dica:
societies in London,or for one which some of my si ienhave larci\
inlfituted in Glouceftcrfhire. But it would 'ake avo ume to relate
all the facts which this difenvery seems to explain, and the ron
fequences to which it leads. C. H. PARRY.

FROM TIIE LEE.
CONJECTURES ON TAXATION.;
FAXES may be considered as a compofntah in
lieu of per(bnal service, paid to the ft ate'fur
the support and equipment of those who are don
flantly employed in the service of the public, or
furniih the means for its protection.
It has been alleged,thai certain imposts are paid
by particular orders of the people, without af
fecting the other clafies of the community. '
Wheji we tefieft however, on the dependence
the different ranks of the people have upon each (
other, we can hardly conceive how one class can'
be affedled, without affecting all the other clades.
We ought 110 c to confound the advance, with
the ultimate payment of the taxes; the one is ob
vious, the other may elude our obl'ervation. /
When the circumstances of a nation are p.VÂ»f
perons, it is probable, that everj' additional tax
is ulriinately paid, by :tn increased produce of
the labour of the inductions class of citizens.
If an additional tax is imposed, in confequencs
of an additinn made to the number of the servants
of the public, f.ich addition may diminish Ihe
number of productive labourers ; but the dimi
tiifhed number of labourers may be able to pro
duce as much as the undimini.'hed did. O if an
additional tax be imposed, in consequence of a
more ample provision made for the servants of
the Hate, the productive labourers may be able
to increase the produce of the labour, as much as
the increased provision made to tlie servants of
the state amounts to.
Such increase in the produce of labour, is not
neceflarily the rcfult of an increased exeriion in
industry. As the different branches of industry
are improved, the fame actual exertion produce*
mine than before such improvement took place.
During the progressive itare of a narion there
fore, taxes may be sometimes increased, without
much affecting the great body of the people.
Hence taxes with regard to the,nation in gene
ral, when they are imposed ir. consequence of in
creasing the servants of the (late, may in a cer
tain degree be nominal only ; for if such addi
tion is made from the idle diflipated, fuclj
of tliefe as have 110 fund, from which to defray
their expences, are perhaps no g<eater tax upon
the public when serving the itaie, than they were
before.
Taxes being advanced in money, if the value
of money diminiflies, additional taxes mult be
imposed ; and if such additional taxes are only
equivalent to the fall in the value of money, such
additional taxes will be no more than nominal.
When the circumstances of a (late are itaiion
ary, as production and consumption, or expendi
ture, are equal, every additional rax niuft bedif
charwed, by a diminution of consumption or ex
penditure
11l the declining state of a nation, when pro
duce is less than expendituie, additional t ixes
mud be paid by the exportation of (lock ; in this
cafe they will be doubly felt by the body of the
people.
Induflrry by the exportation of (lock will lose
a valuable inltrument, ami fufter by losing the
demand, which the (lock, while remaining at
home, made upon it.
Taxes then being ultimately paid, either by an
increase of the produce of labour, a diminution
of consumption or expenditure, or by exporting
(lock, it does not appear, will be less fell by the
body of the people, when advanced to the state
by an import on wine, than by a duty upon cau
dles.
Certain individuals will at all times have it in
their power to fiee themselves from the burden
of taxes, by throwing their /hare of it upon the
flioulders of others. This depends not Co murh
on their rank and fit uation, as on the demand for
their labour, or for the use of their property.
The exempt ion therefore, that individuals may
enjoy, from raxes, does not so much depend up
on the mode by which it ft advanced, as upon the
circumlVanccs above mentioned.
Taxes being advanced in money, and in consi
derable funis, the lower clafles of the people not
being poHefled of money, cannot be fubjeified to
â¢ lie advance of taxes.
Hence poll taxes have been found oppreflive;
and such taxes are obnoxious, because they are
100 visible. Taxes of this fpecieswill generality
be paid with reluctance, and in many cases with
difficulty ; of this kind may be reckoned the win
dow and lioufe taxes. (T$ be continued.)

JACK and the DEACON.
An Anecdote in the Style of Peter Pindar
TWO sons of Neptune, Jack and Will,
One Sunday'* morn were walking,
On various fubjetts, this and that,
With much fang froid were talking.
Per chance as near a house of prayer
They fearlefs urg'd their careless way,
The deacon of the church they met; -
In robes bedizen'd for the day.
He bow'd, and thus the tars addrefs'd,
44 Good firs, why pass ye thus the time;
Surely you'd better walk with me ;
Sport on this day is no small crime .
With all my heart, each tar reply'd,
And boldly with the man they venfur'd ;
Who kindly led thrm to the house:
When on his course the parson enter'd.
With prayer the solemn work begins,
A foag'of Zion next succeeds;
And here the deacon, rising flow,
Gravely proclaims the psalm and reans
" With Hyfop purge thy servant Lord
Then tun'd aloud his vocal nose;
But luckless man, behold ! a tune,
That fuiied ill his verse, he chose:
Thrice he eflay'd to found the line ;
And thrice he hem'd to change his tone;-
But vain, aljs ! prov'd each attempt;
The man now wifh'a himfelf alone.
Jack, mov'd to pity, law his friend's distress,
Nor could he long his fummon'd feelings curb,
But rising from hts feat he loudly cry'd,
L Deacon ! for Gâd's fake try some other herb.

A MISTAKE CORRECTED,
Meflrs. Thomas & Andrews.
IN your last magazine, a lady under the dena
ture oÂ£ 1 hilenia bas favored the public with a
beautiful and pathetic poein, on the loss of the
question for the abolition of the blavc Trade, in
the British Parliament. The concluding address
to those dillinguifhed characters who ftipporrec.
the motion is particularly animated and (hiking:
but I must beg leave to correct a final! millake
â which Philenia has incurred in supposing Mr.
Wilberforce, the leading advocate in this de
bate, to be a member of the society of jricnds.
This may probably have arifeu from the early,
general, and indefatigable exertions of that so
ciety in this cause of humanity, both in Europe
and America. Mr. Wilberforce is a profefled
member of the efhiblifhed church, having re
ceived his education at St. Joint's college, in the
university of Cambridge. This truly philan
thropic Senator has been Representative in the
British Parliament for the coiiury of York, since
the year 1784; and though poflclTed of a deli
cate and sickly constitution, has devoted the most
ardent and persevering attention for several
years to this common cause of judice and bene
volence, the advocates for which, we hope, not
vithftanding their late defeat, will finally be
crowned with success.

EXTRACTS.
tt a VERY sensible and good tnan, and an
exemplary divine, once told in c i_ 'h a!:
when he fettled in the ministry, his parilhioners
would all with one accord, have il that he was
an angel ; a few years, he said, convinced tuein
of their error ; and then, lays lie, they as utu
verfally agreed that 1 must be a devil. Ihe truth
was that this man was neither devil nor angel ;
but if viewed with an impartial eye, and his
perfections and imperfe<ftions both considered,
would have been found to be a very woi thy
man. Men in high Nations in life are too often
treated in this way. Sometimes they have too
much merit ascribed to them, but ottner too lit
tle : Envy is ever officious on these occasions ;
people are apt to imagine when they fee one ril
ing in the world, that he is rising from their ru
ins ; the applause given to a riling chat after,
seems to echo reproaches to them ; they immedi
ately let themselves to work to retain their sup
posed merited importance ; and as is always the
cafe, with weak minds, they begin at the wrong
end ; instead of corrediingtheir own faults, their
whole time is devoted to hunting for foibles in
he man of eminence, the objetfl of their envy ;
and if, in him, they can discover blemishes, they
are spread abroad as veils for their own."
" Friendship is a sacred word, a h jly thing ;
it never subsists but between good men, nor com
mences but by a mutual esteem : It is kept up,
not so much by a benefit received or conferred,
as by a virtuous life. Tliat which makes one
friend aflured of another, is the knowledge he
has of his integrity. The sureties he has for
him, are his good disposition, his truth andcon-
Itancy, No friendlliip can subsist where thei;e
is cruelty, treachery, and injustice. When the
wicked meet together, it is a conspiracy, not a
society of friends. They cannot mutually aid,
'out are afraid of one another. They are not
friends, but confederates in guilt."
" Virtue to crown her Jav' rites lavei to try
Some new, unbeaten pajfage to the Jky;
Where God a feat among the juji Jkall give,
To those who diejor meriting to live!"â
Virtue and eminent abilities are so far from being a defence
against the fhafts of malice avd envy, that they seem peculiarly cx
pofed to their attacks âthe shadow is not a more constant attend
ant on the fubflance, than the ill wishes of the worjl characters on
the bejl.âBut every good man knows that this is a tax which he
Tiuft puy for that sublime pleasure which results from conscious
â¢ e&itudc.
The malignant bosom is conflantly feeling a return of those cor
roding sensations which harrow up its tortured imaginationâits
envenomed attacks recoil with redoubled force on iifelfâfor, like
Svfiphus, it is condemned to perpetual and unprodu&ive exeÂ»-
ions.
Hapnv is it for mankind that their natures are too versatile for
the constant and universal exercise of this balefu) The
envious often find themfclves solitary beingsâfor in the revolu
tions of human affairs it constantly happens, that the public opi
nion does justice to innate probity and real abilitiesâ

THE fir ft king of Franc* was Pharamond,who
at the head of a colony of Franks, attempt
ed the conquelt of that country,then called Gaul ;
and his ceremony of inauguration was that of
being carried round his camp on a buckler.â
This was in the year 4-20 ; and in 2g years after
wards, Merovious, who was the fuccellbr of Clo
dio, the son of Pharamond, made himfelf mafler
of Paris.
In 493, the Chtiftian religion began to flourifn
there,3 and Clovis, who married the King of

and the oil poured on the King with a phial,
which was announced to nave been brought from

Some thouf.inds of the people were baptized-at

Extract of aI; iter from an officer in the Teitrtl
Army, to the editor, dated Fort-Fitt dug. 9, 1791.
" On Sunday last I arrived at this pod wirli
about 200 men, after a disagreeable march of
700 miles. I found that all the troops had gone
down the river, except 300 levies. Next week
we embark for Fort Washington. The whole
army will be about 4000, exclusive ofthe militia.
Heaven grant us success.
" About 12 miles from this place, I encamped
lad Saturday. I was curious to behold the place
where Gen. Braddock was defeated in 1755'.
With my two officers, and a man of this country
acquainted wirh the ground, I marched about 4
miles to it, and we made such observations as
gave us fatisfatftion. The man who conduced
us, led us to a tree which had a number of balls
in it, and which had been felled about 25 years.
â Mr. C. my Ensign, fonnd a grape fliot in one
part of it, about 2 J feet from the butt, which he
cut outâand which, together with two pieces of
skull Bones which I picked up on the field, I
fend you, by the bearer, Lieut. Sherman. You
will observe how the wood and iron are concret
ed. We reconnoitred the place at which he pafl
ed the riverâit is called the Monongehala, nine
miles from this place, that and the Alleghany
river make the head of the Ohio. I give you
this information and fend the balls and bones, m
I think it may ain life you and my friends. I wish
I had time to have been more particular,butyoti
may rely 011 the factâlt was not made in a Print

Philadelphia, September 14.
By an arrival at New-York, Englilh papers are receiver! lo the
20th Jul\. -They inform that all negotiations for peace between
Auftna, Rnffia ami thf Porte, were broken oft.âThat the Ruffian
army had crollVd the Danube under General Kutufnw, a-tacked
arid defeated a body of 23,000 Turks.âThat the exchange between
London and Paris is at 27 per ccut.âThat the French refugees ap
pear to bee'atid with the present posture of affairs in France.â
That the anniversary of the Fiench Revolution was celebrated bv
the Revolution Society at the Crown and Anchor. Lord Stanhope
declining the chair, it w?s filled by Mr. Rous. A mobairem
bled, inlillmg on the liberation of Lord Ccorge Go: don to join in
the celebration, 1 ut on the appearance of the military they dis
persed. A report, which was credited, was in cumula
tion, that a great riot had taken place in Dublin on the 14th of
Julv--and that nearly the whole of one street was burnt.
That a number ot persons having alTeinhlcd a- Birmingham to ce
lebrate the above anniversary, the mob had assembled before the
Hotel where the meeting was held, and being exasperated by ac
counts of the company's proceedings, thai thev Had drank, De
Jlruttion to the present Government- â¢and the King's Head in a rharget,
Be. broke into the House, dellioycd the windows, glalT &c.
pelted the individuals and oblijed th m to seek faicty 111 flight.
This was fucceededed by a dreadful Riot, in which the houses ot
Dr. Priestly, Mr. John Ryland, John Taylor, Esq. Mr. Hutton,
Mr. George Humphreys William RlllTt.ll, Esq. Mofley Hall,
and Mr. H.iwkÂ«, some dilfenting me; ting houses, and fev -ral hou
ses of dissenters, were d ftioyed by fire. This riot con
tinued from the 14th to the 17th Julyâand was it poffihle more
alarming thin that cxpcrienctd in London in 1780. Great num
bers of the rioters lofi their lives by being in ihe cellars of houses,
the walls of which fell in upon them. Dr. Priestly narrowly e<-
caped with his life. By the intervention of the military tran
quility was restored, but not until many bves were loft on both
fides. [Further particulars of this distressing event shall appeal
in our next.]
A great lermentation appears to cxift in Franceâthe King and
Queen continue confined. The King of Spain hns written to the
National Assembly, refpsfling the King, advising conciliatnrv
measuresâThe Affcmbly voted this answer, " That as the French
ration does not intend to meddle with ihc affairs oftoreign pow.
ers, so fore' gn powers have no bufmefs to meddle with the affairs
of the French nation." Therefultof the-report of the Com
mittee of enquiry rrfpe&ing the French King's flight, was, " That
there ii no crime committed agairjl the (onjlitution by the King ; nnd if
therewas,Jiill the King's inviolability would not permit him to be tried."

Kxtrafl of a letter from a citizen oj the United States, at Madeira, to a
j.< J rr i -
gentleman in this city dated July 19.
" The anniversary of our political binh day was celebrated
here at the house of the Consul, John M. Ptntard, Esq. with due
refpeft ; at sunrise an elegant (ilk flag of the United States was
difplaved in front of the house ; at three o'clock the masters ot all
the American vessels in port, nine in number partook of an en
tertainment provided by the Consulâa band of mufick played
during the time ot dining, and fifteen toasts daptcd to the occa
lion were drank, attendeel by thedifcharge of cannon ; at sunset
the company moved to the green in front of the house, when the
colours were ftiuck under a difchargc of fifteen guns.
Â» The Consuls' House is fituatcd on an eminence in full view of
the whole townâthe celebration was therefore a very confpicu
ousobjed*âthe natives of the island in general are very well dtf
pofed towards the people of the United States- -and I ain firmly
persuaded that if our country continues to support her character
and credit (he will have the worthy of all countries, for friends;
as to the envious and contra&ed of a.iy nation, their friendfhip
cannot be considered as an arqtufition. Our Coitful here pofleflcs
the genuine spirit of an American ; the events, that led to
empire and independence such as the brilliant stroke at Tren

they are always invited to unite with him in the joy of the dayâ
if none happen to be here--he hoists hi.- flag and celebiates with
bis own familyâin short his countrymen are always wflcomc
at his house, and he never appears so happy as when he has the
pleasure of their company. M. Pintard is now eflablifhed m bu

A letter from a gentleman in Montreal, dated
Auiruft t9, fays : " Lord Dorcheiter failed so

l'on arrived 1 nlt week at Oucbec. '
Mr. Annnftus Christian George Elholm, la'ely

brig Galgo, (lloyal Packci) command
ed by J< fejÂ»h Rodriga Cabfera, bound to the Ha
â A
vannah, with paflemgers, and partly loaded witli
lumber, failed from New-Orleans the 21 it of
June last, and overset the 23d at 5 o'clock in t.ie
morning, 40 leagues S. of Penlacola, wherein 8
nerfons instantaneously perished ; in which num
ber were a Spanilh lady (Mrs. Palao, distinguish
ed bv a fuccefsful parental care of a respectable
railed family of both sexes) and her grand daugh
ter, about 6 years of age,âwho were, with seve
ral others, in the cabin at the time of the cataf
trosphe ! From whence lient. Martini Palao (foil
of [he deceased lady) and himfelf (the said Mr.
Elholm) saved themselves with great difficulty,
by Retting out through the water at the door,
and with the aflifVanceof the rigging, joined the
fuwivors on the fide of the veflel.
" When the party, for about the space of four
hours, concejving every moment the last, had
sustained the violence of the waves, in a boifte
rotis storm, rain, and thunder, amidll the dread
ful scene of floating deceased friends ; (for the
partition between the cabin and the main deck,
was at this time destroyed by tltc irrefiftable
force of the sea, and consequently every thing
waflied out) the malls at once gave way at the
deck, and cleared the wreck by the agitation of
the sea, which gave liberty to the hull to right
it so as to admit the crew to enter the highest
fide of the quarter-deck ; in which situation, fill
ed with water, and loaded with green lumber,
(lie at belt floated very deep, and in consequence
of her pitching, but seldom above water.
" In aho ut 5J hours after this disastrous event
the wind and waves fortunately abated, which
afforded an opportunity to kindle a fire with a
flint and sI eel , which a peculiar circumltance had
preserved. Night now coining on, the people
fatigued and exhaulled by the want of frefli wa
te-.'&c. found means to tie themselves on the
highest places on tlie hull, to indulge in some
decree a requifire repose, fecuredly froni the
dangerous walliing of the ocean ; firlt eftablifh
inÂ« a watch by turns to keep up the light, in
hones to draw attention, if any veflel fliould, by
the will of Providence, be directed that way,
which had tiiewifhed for effortâfor the friendly
and humane Capt. Dolhonde. commanding the
Amiable Maria, from New-Orleans, the ensuing
night perceiving the fire which was kept up,and
governed bv a humane disposition, which on the
occasion acquired the praises of all good men,
altered his conrfe to enquire whether a light not
commonly seen on veflels that dillance from land,
might not be a signal of a people in dittrefs ;
and thus came to their relief about two o'clock
in the mornirg, and fevenry hours after their
(hip wreck.

their recovery, which he imparted with no lcfs
attention than as noted liberality ; and the 6th

A Senator to complete the representation of
this State, in the Senate of the United States,
tho long since wanted, lias not been chosen, be
ranfe the two Houses of our Legislature, could
not agree upon the mode wliich was to be sol
lowed in making the appointment. Ihe Senate
wifii the appointment made by a concurrent vote
of both houses ; and ihs other Branch contend,
that it ought to be by the jtinf vote of ihe mem
bers of both Houses, in one body met. Jn en
deavoring to determine this important queltion,
much lime has been unnecefl'ai ily spent, in con
sidering the expediency of each mode ; unnecef
farilv, because the mode is pointed out by the
Constitution of (he United States : There would
be rooin for doubt and debate, if the provifiom
of the constitution were not pofuive in t par
ticular, and if the mode coukl be deduced only
by construction from the words of the Constitu
tion ; but this is not the cafe. The letter ol the
Conilitiition speaks thus: " The Senate of the
'â¢ United States {hall be coropofed of two Sena
" tots from each State, chojen by the Lecisla
<e TURK thereof, &c." Now our State Constitu
tion as expt efsly fays, that the legislative fewer
this Commonwealth, Jhall be vejlcd in two Houses,
a Senate, and Hottfe of Representatives : So that
it appears clearly, by the Constitution of the Uni
ted States, that the appointment of a Senator,
must be a Legifiative a<st of the State, and the Le
gislature of t his State, by its constitution, con
lifts of two houses ; without dispute, tho ever (o
inexpedient, the Senator must bold his appoint
mem by a concurrent Vote. A queltion he:e ari
ses, whether this vote ntuft not be qualified by
the approbation of the Governor, as an article of
lie Stare Constitution expiefsly declares, " that
everyorder, refoltition, or vote, to which the
concurrence of both houses may be neceftary
(except on a qneftion of adjournment) (hall be
presented to the Governor, or, being disapproved,
See." The question, indeed, is answered by the
words of the constitution, the letter of which
speaks also positively hereâit must be solved,
without hesitation, in the affirmative..

At the prcfcnt moment there is a truly laudable fpirii of'onirr.
prize and improvement txtant among the* citizens of the United
States. The improvement of our inland navigation is a fubj cl
that engroflVs the attention of public bodies, and individuals in
various parts of the union. Nature has performed her part moil
amply in furnilhing our country with natural, cxhauftltfs res r
voirs, and rivers that interfett the country in innumerable direc-
tions. What remains then but that Art fliould complcat her ge
nerous intentions ?
Almost infinitely less labor and expence than has been employed
on a (ingle canal in Great-Britain, would in Come of these states
unite rivers, that would open an interior intercourse, the advan
tages of which cannot be eftimatcd.
The plan said to be now prosecuting in North-Carolina for u
niting that state with Virginia, by an interior water communica
tion, is a noble undertaking. The provision made by this Com
monwealth for improvements in the roads, and clearing obftruc-
tions in its numerous rivers, evinces a spirit of enterprize and pa
triotism highly honorary to the Government. In other parts of
the Union a similar dilpofition is apparent ; and it may not be too
sanguine to fuppofc, that the period will arrive when those im
mense bodies of water which form the internal seas of the United
States, and which from their elevated situations appeal calculated
for the purpose, may by art and labour be made locks or fourcc s of
canals, that shall waft the produce of our country from the Lake
of the Woods to the Atlantic.
There are several projeÂ£ts now on foot in the state of MafTac.hu
fetts for improving their navigation. The account recently pub
lilhcd of a survey in the diftrift of Maine, (hews that our country
is susceptible of improvements which have hitherto escaped obser
vation, but which the present happy period seems defi ned to bring
to view, attended with circumstances that slash conviction of their
feafibilitv on the mind of the tnoft cursory enquirer. We are in
formed that the result of the survey lately undertaken and executed
at thr inftanceof the Secretary at War, respeCting the practicabi
lity of opening an internal water communication from ConncCti
cut river, with some of the rivers in the neighbourhood of Bjfton,
pref nts no obftaclcs that may not be furmownted by an expence,
which would be abundantly re-imburfed by the advantages which
would accrue to the public from compleating the business.
The design of fixing the Manufactories, about to be established,
in the state of New- ]ci ley, mud meet the approbation of all who
are friends to the Union, peace and good under (landing of the ci
tus of Philadelphia and N-w-YoikâThe inhabitants of these
places will be intereftcd in this patriotic undertakingâbheir mu

MR. FEN NO,
THE general rcftettions contained in the extra&s from the North-
Carolina Gazette, published in your last paper, like all other ind'.f
ciminate charges on colle&ive bodies, or aggregate deu riptions
of persons, cannot be founded in truth. That a pra&ice so hostile
to the commercial or moral chara6ler of the people as that ot a'-
temp &at counterfeiting '.he hano writing of others, should lÂ»e al
most nniverfallv prevalent among the youth o{ North-Carolina, is
a monstrous and absurd supposition, and carries a refutation on its
very furface.
I doubt not this malignant charge will be properly notirrdâ
and should not be at all surprized to find that it oiiginated with
some disappointed fpcculator, who has flittered by purchafidg
counterfeit paper. A. B.
