A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 69, HIGH-STREET, PHILADELPHIA
[No. 88, of Vol. lII.] Wednesday, February 29, 1792.
FOR THE GAZFTTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
IF a people are to be governed by force, perhaps they cannot
know too littleâthe moic ignorance, the more peace and 4111-
etuefi. But in a free country, the people in effcÂ£t govern them
selves. The more knowledge is spread among them, the better.
The reason and good sense ot the public, make the i*fic light to
those who administer its affairs.
Experience haj verified, and is every day confirming thcrfe ob
servations. We are to thank the good (rnfe ot the great bodv ot
the American nation for the happy constitution we enjov. T'ie
people saw and felt the neceflity of a fnmer governmrnt, and their
imderlhndings approved the plan which was submitted to their
eonfideration? All Europe saw with aftonifhmcnt a whole peo
ple quietly reasoning down a deleflive government, and matur
ing a revolution which has diffuf d a lustre on the national charac
ter. As no other people ever did the like, it may not be deemed
arrogant to conclude, that no nation has been Co generally well
informed as to admit o{ it. The latt does more honor to the great
body of our citizens, than victorious fleets and armies ever pro
cured for a nation.
These reflexions afford all the hope we have of the continuance
and profperitv of the national government. At this time, it is
peculiarly consoling to a friend of the country to recoiled* these
ta&s, so honorable to our citizens. For the number and nature of
the late publications against the government and its mealutes,ma
ny of them finally virulent in their Spirit, and profligately bold
in their aspersions, would have an alarming influence upon public
order and tranquility, if our countiymen in general were not great
ly superior both in virtue and discernment to these writers. But
as the good sense of the people caused the government to have a
bring, it may he relied on to support it. It is only necessary to
â¢warn them that men are not wanting who would destroy it if they
could. Indeed if the numerous writers against its measures bt
their own charges, they may be excused for theattempt. If! rum
its funding law, from the impure fountains of corruption and {pe
culation, flow Jlreams which will poison your country and your prospe
rity, if under the fin&ion of that law plans of opprefjion are laid, equal
ly injurious to the general welfare as any firaflifed under the BntiJ/i ju~
rifdiftion, if tho you took up arms againjl opprefjion, you are (as it is
inftnuated) read\ bridled andf-tddledfor your reprefentatwey, with whips
in their hands, to ride you from one end. of the United States to the other,
The inference is natural and wai rantable, that these writers wilh
to deftmy the government which is the cause of all this evil.
The rvewfpapers have poured fort>h a torrent like the foul Oeci
ipcn.given above. Men of sense and virtue read these effufions
with proper contempt. Theydeferve to be further diicounte
n a needâfor tho the public is too well informed to be imposed
upon by these means, yet there is a disgrace fullered by their pub
lication. The moral state of a country may be known, and it is
also considerably influenced by the manner in which political de
putes are managed.
If the chargesagainft men and measures are ufuarllv made tem
perately and supported by argument, you may be iure the people
are thought capable of conviction by those means, and by no o
ther. Th.c people are some improved, and not the worse served
in conference. But when the basest suspicions are insinuated
without any proof, and the moil absurd and unfounded afTcrtions
are solemnly made, the writers mull depend for fucccfs upon the
bafeuels of their readers. The worst of men are the moll ealy to
believe eil repons. If truth is treated with total in
the public papers, no man will doubt that the tendency is perni
cious to morals. The public are in dar.ger of being cjrrupied by
the daily example of men who let their paftions loole, and exert
all their faculties to communicate them to tneir rcadeis. It isthe
business of education to subdue the violent paflions. With every
precaution they are apt enough to run to excess. But this is a
course of v cious education to inipire the fharpell resentments in
the readers brcafts, and to indulge them by t?Â»e facrificc of the ob
jeÂ£U yf thern.
There are some falfhoods which affront the reader by their
grolTnefs. Tlvey (hew bow little the writer refpeds him or h>s
undemanding. A writer in a late infLmmatory production,fays,
" The public debt became so great by the meaiures of the fpecu
-44 latorsto enhance the nominal value of the certificates in their
44 potlcflion. Who can believe (fays he) that they could have a
-44 lifeu to a $th, or even a lOth ot the magnitude, without the in
-44 terference of a system of {peculation ? Not a small portion ot
â¢ 4 them originated, like the mushroom, under cover ot the nightâ
cf shall we pay taxes to discharge principal or interest of debts,
44 created piincipally tor the emolument of speculators ?"
None who can read, aie fa foolilh as to believe that the specu
lators made their own certificates, or altered the face of them to
increase the futn, and that the funding ad, instead of providing
for an old debt contracted before the newspapers were adorned
wit h the word fpeculatoys, created a new one tor the emolument
ot rhefe menâlf there is weakness enough to believe all this, the
writer has found a market for his work of fallhood. But the dif
cerningreader who will the abfu dity of these aflertions,
wi l be shocked at the profligacy of the auihor, who in the midst
oi themâfays, w The all-beholding eye which controuls the
4i universe pierces thro the deception of these men (fpecuiator )and
" pronounces the pait of their repÂ« c fcniaiions to be lies."
â Such solemn expretlions in the very ad of deceiving ! The read
er will make his own comments.
It is not easy to believe that the people can be made wiler, or
the government more honest by wicked attacks upon its meaiures
â Free enquiry can do no injury to either. The di feu Hi on of
public queltions cannot be exocded to be kept within the bounds
nt moderation and candor. But writers, even ol loose principles,
(hould be made to pay some lelpcd to truth and decorum.
LONDON, November 19.
THE Spanish Amballador at Peteriburgh has
made a present to: he cm pre f's i n the name of
the society of coimnei ce at Cadiz, of several tons
of excellent Malaga wine. The empress accepted
them very graciooily, and h.is permitted all such
wine to be imported into Peicrfourgh, dutyfree,
during the year ) 7Q2.
Prince Ferdinand of Prussia and all his family
were lately in danger of being poisoned on their
road to Aix la Chapelle, at a;; inn, where some
provisions were dressed in copper veflels : they
were all feizcd in the night with violent pains,
and the princess Louisa was so ill, that her lite
was despaired of. They are now, however hap
pily recovered.
A veilel is now lying in the river, waiting to
carry out colonists for the new eftablilhinent at
Sierra Leona. About three hundred adventurers,
some of them very refpeJtable, are upon her lilt
of paflengers.
At a late meeting of the royal college of phy
sicians of Edinburgh, there were presented ro
them some scarce and curious books from the ho
norable Lord Hailes, with a very polite letter
from his Lordship lo one of the fellows, in the
following words :
" Some time ago you furnifhed me with a copy
of the catalogue of the books belonging to your
faculty. While putting 1113- books in order, I
found three volumes in the medical line, which
are no: in your catalogue.
" 1 beg that the college would accept of them,
not as a present valuable in itfelf, but as expres
sive of my vvifh that private gentlemen would fol
low the example, and transmit the medical books
of which they mny be poflelled to the faculty.
There they may be ornamental, if not tifeful ;
in private hands they are neither. Were this
plan generally adopted, 1 imagine that even in
this narrow country a large accession of books
might be obtained. 1 have always had a fort of
enthusiastic zeal for public libraries, where a
man might have hopes of finding any book con
nected with the studies of the society to which
the library belongs."
The Royal college accepted his Lordfiiip's pre
sent with mod hearty thanks for it, and for the
letter which accompanied it ; the sentiments ex
prefl'ed in which are so jult, and so truly liberal,
that there can be no doubt, if they were gene
rally known they would be as generally adopted.
December io,
The situation of Lord Cornwallis is certainly
to be pitied, opposed by the elements, and depen
dent on the faith of Indian allies. The integri
ty of his mind, and his high martial talents, mult,
however, always render his Lordlhip an objetft
of refpeiti and confidence.
This country, in conjunction with Prussia and
Holland, at prefeni plays the leading part in Eu
rope. The diflinifiion, it mull be owned, is en
viable, and it remains only to improve and se
cure its advantages by a moderate and enlight
ened policy.
The Americans are about to eftablifti a Mint.
This is one of the prerogatives of Sovereignty,
which they have not exercised hitherto, being
content to make use of the Englifli and Spanish
coin, which they procure ill exchange for their
commodities.
Lifoon is at present benefiting not a little by
the access of Englilh persons of diltindiion.â
There are the Duke and Dochefs of Northum
berland, the Earl of Shrewftjury, and laltly the
Margravine of Anfpach, who can afford together
to spend about an hundred and fifty thousand
pounds a year.
On Monday lad arrived his Majefly'sfliip As
surance, from Halifax, with troops ; which place
(he left 24 days ago. She parted company with
the Argo on Sunday in a hard gale of wind. The
Argo is not yet arrived. The Afliirance's palTage
has been the quickell that has been made lately,
having run into foundings in II days from her
leaving Halifax.
A perfoti under imprifoiiment for forgery has
written a letter ro the President of the National
Afl'cmbly, in which he exculpates M. Varnier
from the treason laid to his charge, and takes
the crime upon hiinfelf. This, you will fay, is
a suspicious defence. True, but have patience ;
this affair of M. Varnier is one of the mod mys
terious, perhaps the blacked combination of
guilt, that has sullied the lteps of this unaccount
able revolution. This is not the only letter
behold the history of another celebrated epifHe ;
M. Bazire denounced M. Varnier as guihy of
having written a letter to a Monsieur Noiror, of
Dijon, also in prison, which contained a plan for
a counter revolution, &c.â M. Varnier being
Ihewn the signature, acknowledged the refem
blunce of the hand writing, which hefaid was an
adroit imitation, but denied it tobehis. He was
not shewn the contents of the lettei. M. Bazire
refufed to explain how such a letter came into
his pofleffion till the High National Court should
be afleinbled. M. Varnier, ignorant of the crime.

[Whole No. 296.]
is committed ro pi-ifon, where no person is ad
mitted to fee liim, and where l<e remains. LÂ»lt
night the President of the National AlJenibly re
ceived a letter from the Municipality of Auxonne,
containing a declaration and a paper, committed
to their keeping by a Monsieur Voulon, a lock
finith of that town.
M. Voulon had received a letter by the post
from M. Bazire, the Deputy, thanking him for
the communication of M. Varnier's crime, and
the honor he had done him in feletfling him to
be his accuser. Astonished at such a letter, ha
ving never written to Mr. Bazire, knowing noÂ»
thing of any crime or imputation against M.
Varnier or M. Noirot, he flies to the Municipa
lity, where he makes such a declaration, and dc
pofits the letter he had received.
M. Bazire, in his defence, produces the letter
he had received, and which is his authority for
accusing M. Varnier.
Letter, to M. Bazirf.
" SIR,
" MY comrade courts the daughters of Madame
Damont, inn-keeper, in this town ; Monsieur
Noirot, our tax gatherer, lodges at Madame Da
mont'sâhe is gone to Pontarlier fÂ«r a few days ;
my comrade having been to fee the daughter of
Madame Damont, found her putting Monsieur
Noirot's room to rights ; he saw upon a table a
letter which Monf. Varnier had wrote to him for
a Counter Revolution.
He took the letter, and has given it to me ; I
fend it to my cousin at Paris, that he may deliver
it to you, for the purpose of your accusing the
author.
(Signed) " VOULON."
The Assembly, upon the reading of this letter
were naturally embarrafled and alarmed with a
thousand successive and contradictory thoughts
and opinions upon this dark affair. Will it be
believed that, instead of liberating M. Vamier
who has no longer any accnfer, whose original
accuser is demonstrated to be a lyara.id a forger
for the worst of frauds, that they finiihed with
referringthe papers to the Archives, from whence
they will be taken by the Grand Jury, and pro
ceeded to name the Solicitors of the National
Aflembly in this inock trial. Mr. Garran de,
Coulon was chosen. There was not in favor of
any other person that majority which the Confu
tation requires.
The High National Court is therefore to be,
formed, and to fit at Orleans for the trial of
Monf. Varnier.
The King has refufed his fanAion to the fa*-
guinary bill brought in againlt his brothers, of
ficers, arid nobles, who have placed the Rhine
between them and the usurped authorities, which
seem to only to denounce and provoke ven
geance and forfeiture on their heads !
But when once the High National Court is in
stituted, the Assembly may, according to the
Constitution, denounce and accuse any perfou
before them ; and it is not Monsieur Varnier,
but Monsieur, and the Princes of France, the
Emigrants and the Non-conformifls, who are to
be aecufed at this tribunal. Thus is an engine
of terror eretfled againit the Nobility, the Church
and even the Throne, who having there no ne
gative, no power of pardon, may fee its belt and
molt faithful friends ignominioufly dragged tÂ»
a popular trial, where an accusation is the fore
and dreadful harbinger of a sentence.
I cannot comment upon this abominable at
tempt ; may its violence, its evident injufticc
and fraud defeat iis purpose ; may the Clubs ot
Jacobines, and the Jacobines of the Aflembly,
detedted and detested, give up their horrible en
terprize in delpair ; but let their attempt never
be forgotten !
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, Dfc. 2.
The Commiifioners of the Fund of Extraordi
naries Itated, that the sales of national property
far November, amounted to 156,269.000, making
with the former (ales 1,117,000,000 of livres.
M. the Minister at War, sent along
memorial oij the various objects of his depart
ment, in which he announced his relignacion,
and the King's acceptance of it.
Several Members complained that he had not
accompanied the notice of his resignation with
an account of what the law required of him, ami
moved, " that he should not leave the kingdom
before giving an account of his administration
observing that M. Montinorin was no longer in

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, February 20.
In committee oj the whole, on the t ijhery Hill.
[continued.J
MR. WILLIAMSON.âIt has been urged with
_ great propriety, in favor of the bill now
fobmitted to our confidei ation, that the opera
tion of our laws should in all cases tend to encou
rage ofeful industry ; that while we are giving
back the duties on all other foreign goods which
are exported, it would be unjufl: and cruel to re
fufe a full drawback of the duties 011 fait which
may be exported, especially when the cfrcuin
fiances of its exportation, are attended with an
mcreafe of riches and strength to the nation.
Imprefled as I am with the force of these argu
ments, and desirous as I ani to protect and en
courage the native seamen of America by all pru
dent, practicable, and constitutional means, I
lhall-neverihelefs find it 3iy duty to vote for link
ing out the firft fe<!tion of the bill, because it pro
poles to give a bounty for the encouragement of
the veliels employed in the filheries.
We have been told that the name is improper ;
that it is simply a drawback oftheduty upon fait,
and gentlemen have produced a very ingenious
calculation, bv which they attempt to prove,that
in some years it may happen,that the whole duty
onthe fait will not be repaid; but they admit that
in some years the drawback or bounty will ex
ceed the doty. It is certainly their opinion, and
in this we are perfectly agreed, that the money
to be paid will be more than that received, elf'e
there had been no use for so large an appropri
ation. We fhali not trouble th:(i committee with
calculations on this fubjeifK It is conceded that
the encouragement to be given probably; will
exceed the full drawback .of the duty on fait.
In other words a douceur or a proper bounty is
to be givenâ.let ijs call it one thousand dollars
per annum. Is it within the powers of this Con
gress to grant bounties ? 1 think not, and on 1 his
Angle position, 1 wquld reft the argument.
In the conftitntion of this government there
are two or three remarkable provisions which
seem to be in point. " It is provided that di
redt taxes shall be apportioned among, the seve
ral states according to their refpeclivenumbers."
It is alfoprovided that "all duties, impolls, and
cxcifcs shall be u*nifoxm thioughou-t the United â¢
States : and it is provided that no preference
shall be given by any regulation of commerce or
revenue to the ports of one {late over ihofe ofano
ther. The clear and.obvioos intention of the
articles mentioned was, that Congress might itwr
have the power of imposing unequal burdens,
that it might not be in their powei to gratify one
part of the Union by oppi effing another. It ap
peared possible and not very improbable, that
the time might come, when by greater cohelion,
by more unanimity, by more address, the repre
sentatives of one part of the union might attempt
to iinpofe unequal taxes or to relieve their con
flituents at the expense of other people. To pre
vent the possibility of such a combination, the
articles that I have mentioned were inserted in
the constitution. Suppose a poll tax ihould be
attempted, suppose it should be enacted that eve
ry poll in the eartern Urates, shall pay a tax of
half a dollar, and every poll in the southern
frares should pay a tax of one dollar. Do you
think we should pay the tax .' No, certainly
We should plead the constitution, and tell you
that the law was impotent and voi.d.
But we have been cold tint Congrefsmay give
bounties for ufeful purposes that is to lay
they may give bounties for all imaginable pur
poses, because the fame majority that votes the
bounty win not fail to call' the purpose a good
Â«ne. Establish the doiTtriue of bounties and let
us fee what may follow. Uniform .axes are laid
to raile moneyâand that money is diftribtitecfâ
not uniformly ; the whole of it may be given to
the people in one end of the Union. Could we fav
in fuel, a cafe that the fax had been uniformâ
I think not -There is certainly a majority i n this
w 10 think that the nation would belftronger
and more independent, if all our labor was per
formed by free men. This object might be pro
moted by a bounty. Let a poll tax be laid ac
cording to the constitution ofone dollar per poll â¢
in this cafe sixty cents must be paid for each Save'
and the number of slaves beinp- Mo , hei ;
tax would amount to r dollars. To en
courage ,he labor of citizens, let Congress then
give an annual bounty of one dollar to eve-y f, C r
man who ,s a mechanic, who labors iâ the
field. We might be told that the bo-.ty was
fniall, and the objerfl was good, but the measure
would be molt oppressive, for it woold he a clear
tax of rather more than three hundred thousand
dollars on the southern Hates. -
Perhaps the cafe I have pur istooftrong. Con
gress can never do a thiiig that is so palpably nn
jnlt, but this -fir, is the very mark at which the
theory ef bounties seems to point. The certain
operation of that areata re is theoppreflion of the
southern Itaies, by foperior numbers in the nor
thern ioterell. This was to be feared at the for
mation of this government, and you find many
articles in the conftiturioni, besides those I have
quoted, which were certainly intended to guard
us agninll the dangerous bias of ituerfcft and the
power of numbers.âWherefore was it provided
that no duty lhould be laid on exports ? Was pt
not to defend the great staples of the foutheryi
Hates, tobacco, rice, and indigo from the opera
tion' of unequal regulations of commerce or un
equal indirect faxes : as another article had de
fended us from unequal direct taxes.
I do not hazard much in faying that the pre
sent conllitution had never been adopted with
out those preliminary guardsin it. Eftablifhthe
general doctrine of bounties, and Â»I 1 the provisi
ons I have mentioned become useless. They va
nish into air, and like the baseless fabric of a vi
sion, leave not a trace behind. The common de
fence and general welfare, in the hands of agood
â politiciap, may supersede every part of our con
ltitution, and leave us in the hands of time and
chance. Manufactures in general, are ufeful to
the nation, they promote the public good and
general welfare ; how many of them arefpring
ing up in the-northern ttates ? Let them be pro
perly supported by bounties, and you will find
no occasion for unequal taxes. The tax may he
equal in the beginning, it will befufficiently un
equal in the end.
We are told that a nuiTery of Teamen may be
of great use to the nation, and the bounty pro.
posed is a very finall one These fir, are the
reasons why 1 have marked this as a dangerous
bill : the molt dangerons innovations are made
under these circumstances. To begin with a
great bounty would be imprudent, and to give
a fmati bounty for a doubtful purpose, might de
serve a worse epithet. HaJf a million of dollars
per annum, would have been too much for a be
ginning, and perhaps a bounty on the use of
lleighs, though they are convenient for travel
ling in winter ; or a bounty on (tone fences,
though they are durable, would not at this time
be prudent. The objetft of the bounty, and the
amount of it, are equally to be disregarded in
the present cafe : we are simply to consider whe
ther bounties may fafely be given under the pre
sent constitution ; for myfelf I would rather be
gin with a bounty of one million per aim. than
oneth'oufand : I wiflj that my conftitnenrs may
know, whether they are to put any confidence
in that paper, called the conÃitution.
You will fuffer me to fav, that the southern
States have much to fear from the progress of
this government, nnlefs your strength is govern
ed by prudence ; the operation of the funding
system, has translated at least two millions of dol
lars, from the southern States, that is to fay
from Georgia, th* Carolinas, and Virginia, to
the Northern Stares. The interest of that sum
when it shall be fix per cent, will be 120,000 dol
lars ; but the quota of those States, is at lead
one third of the whole ; whence it follows that
they mult pay forty thousand dellars every year
t . he . form of interest to the northern 'States!
1 hu, it seems, is not fufficienr, and other mea
sures are to be adopted for draining the south
ern States. Bounties to promote the general
welfare, are already brought forward ; we shall
not hear of a bounty for raising rice, or prepar
ing naval stores. If that was the question, the
general welfare would not have fucli prominent
features. Unless the southern Stares are protect
ed by the constitution, their valuable staples and
their y.fionary wealth, must oc-rafion their de
ftrudtion. Three fliort years has this govern
ment existed ; it is not three years, bur we have
already given fenons alarms to manv of our fel
low-citizens ; eltablifh the doctrine of bounties â¢
set aside that part of the constitution, which re
quires equal taxes, and demand similar diftribu
nons ; destroy this barrier, and it is not a few
fifhertnen that will enter, claiming ten or twelve
thouland dollars, but all manner of personsâ
peop e of every trade and occupation may enter
t the breach until they have eaten up the bread
of our children. 1
Perhaps 1 have viewed this project in too fe
nous a l.ght, but if I am p , rri culirly solicitous
on the fubjecft of finance, rhat we do not even
feein to depart from ,he spirit of the constitu
tion, it is because I wish that the union may be
perpetual. Th, several States are now Pretty
well relieved from their debts, and our fellow
cuizens in the southern States have very ttTe
ile wtV" T iional fu " ds : P reft a lit
wi â¢ "'"T ll '' c^ xes > and the remedy is plain
\ ule w o i*Jd shim bounties, as leading to
clÂ«ngero t â measures, Fam not inattentive toU*
â¢ 'gument that has been advanced by the ho
350
norable member who firft rose !n defence of
bill. That gentleman tells us rhar u
bu(hel of fait is used in coring a quintal of
If thi. be eftaWifoed, aÂ« Luti
be amended by giving a greater drawback. He
fays, the drawback as it is now paid to the mer
chant, does not operate so 3 s to encourage the
seamen who have n.oft Bee d of such affile
r ' ' S , V r y J P r -Â° - ab ' C '' " n ' d the Pities may be
relieved by dividing the drawback in the verv
manner that is proposed by the bill. If* it
true that the proposed bounties, .will .not exceed
the average of the drawback that should be paid
0.. fair, why do they contend about names,an.
lels they are fohcitous about the precedent. If
our obje(ft is to encourage indultry, and to m
create our commerce, by fending fifh to a fareiw
market,we must adhere to the drawback ; fori?
cording to the terms of the bill, th* bounty
be paid, thpngh every fifh that is caught, ihontl
be confnmerf in the country ; in which cafe we
fliould be paying a vifionat y drawback, when no
thing was exported ; according to the terms rff
the bill, there is no proportion between the fai.
bour and the reward, so far as the bank sister*
is concerned ; the bounty in all cases beino d,*
fame. " 6
having exercised your patience in objeftjiw
to tins new system of bounties, and having hiijt
ed on some objections to the genera! operatioi
of the bill, so far as industry and enterprise I
may be desired ; I stall in a few words, fubnuV
the out line of a plan that feei.is to comprehend
all the ufeful parts of the bill, without any
culation upon bounties.
If the drawback on dried fifh exported, is not' â¢
equal to the duty on the fait used in curing'foch
fifh, let rhe drawback be increased to eleven .
cents or twelve cents as rhe cafe may be. Let
us suppose that rhe drawback for the next year
will be equal to the drawback en the last year;
and let that sum of money, being the expected,
drawback, be divided between the f'eamen and
owners according to the terms of rhe bill ; the
accounts mult be made up annually. If the
drawback exceeds the allowance that bad been
made, the difference will be conlidered as advanc
ed to the fifhery, and the allowance for the next
year, mod be fomewhar reduced, according to '
the actual amount Â®f the drawback, if the filh
ermen are more fortunate or ninre active* and
the exports are increased, the allowance for rhe
next year must be railed. The rule being fixed
by law, all that remains being pure calculation,
may be done from year to year by the executive.
Every important objedt of this bill that lias been
presented to our view, may be obtained bv fafe
and constitutional steps. Why should a man
rake a dangerous and a doubtful path, when a
fafe one presents itfelf ? If nothing more is de
sired than to regulate and protect the fi/hery,
thÂ»j>ill may be altered ajld accommodated to,
that purpose, if the theory of bounties is to be
established, by which the southern States mnlt
fuffer while others gain ; the bill informs us
what we are to expert.
(TO EE CONTINUED.)
THURSDAY, February 21
Mr. Macon's motion, as amended, reads thus J
" Resolved,, That the Secretary of' the Treafiiry
cauj~n to be laid before the House a statement of
the balances, if any, remaining unpaid, which
'nay have been due by individuals to the United
States, previous to the 4th day of March, 1789;
and whether any and what Iteps have been taken
to recover the fame ; and also a ftatenient of the
sundry funis of public monies, which may have
been entrusted to individuals, pievious to the
said 4th of March, and have not been accounted
for."
The yeas and nays having been called on the

AgainlV the resolution as originally propose!
by Mr. Macon, it was objeified, that it was infoi
nialâthat the law instituting the treasury cir
parttnent had made every comperent pro v ifiÂ° ll
in the cafeârhat the duty of the Comptroller
was particulaily designated'âand that ;f he lias
been deficient, the proper mode would he ro rail
him to an account, and if found remiss, liefhonM
be impeached. The resolution contained an im
putation on that officer, and vet no gentleman
had come forward with atry dii etflchargesagaiint
him. It was fnrt her fnid that information .had
been received from the Comptroller on this fuJ
NAYS,jeAâthat a compliance with the â¢"efolution
would operate agnnft the intereft'of the United
States
The officers of the treafiry are proceeding in
this business; no charge of remifsnefs has been
adducedâthey have already made greater pio
grefs in fettling the old accounts since the new
government came into operation, than had been
done in many years previous thereto ; and their
investigations receive no interruption but what
arises from the more important bufineis of tiie
present government.
It was enquired what would be tbe effVrt of this
resolution ?âit would bring forward 1000 or
1500 names of persons apparently debtors 10 the
United States ; but the principal part of whom
were either creditors, or did not owe the public
one ng. What is intended to be done as a
consequence of this "disclosure ?âis it designed
that suits shall bs inltitu ted ngainft these per
sons fâthat would induce an unprodutfti ve ex
pence, to an amount which cannot now be elti
inated. The Comptroller is empowered by law
to sue every delinquent; but is he to exercise
no discretion in the discharge of his duty âIt
had been ilated as a reason for adopting the re
solution, that its object was to afcei tain to what
amount these balances if any-,would fupercetie the
neceflity of additional taxesâbut it wasafked,
â would the government be jtilt 1 fieri in adeffing one
farthing less.on. account of these balances, which
inuft be considered in a great measure as fidtiti
ous ?âlt was further said that it was utterly im
poflible for the officers of the" treasury to lfiake
out the statement in question during the present
fefilon.
In support of the resolution it was Paid that it
did not imply either direCtly or indirectly any
imputation againfi: the' Comptrollerâthe Houle
has undoubtedly-a right to call on any of its offi
cers for informationâit is an opinion abroad,
that there are large sums due from individuals',
and the public has.a right to befatisfied that the
proper steps have.been taken to . recover tfiofe
fums-,âthofe fteps'msv have been- pursued, hut
it is not known that they haveâfurthar it jvas
said that this information was necefl'ary in order
to being able to form a competent judgment of
the state of the public accountsâthat :tlie. infor
mation in qiieftion, the Houle had a inoft un
doubted right to receive ; and that it was a very
llrange idea indeed to suppose that it contained
any reflection on the Comptroller, or any other
officer of the Treasury â¢ it was further said, that
no difficulties ought to deter the House from go
ing into the invelligation ; it was immaterial
whofi? names were brought forward in eonfe
quenceâthe balances due to the public oughtte
be knownâThat similar objections to'thofe now
offered, will afways lay againit going into this'
invertigation, and in proportion to the urgency
of the enquiry, will be rhe strength and ingenui
ty of those objectionsâwith refpeCt_ to the disclo
sure of names, it was observed that the truth once
known, would let every man's character in a just
point of lightâthe enquiry, so far from proving
injurious to such characters, appears to be the
moll direCl method to do away the prejndicesar.d
suspicions that have been circulated againit them.
It is said to be problematical whether there are
any balances due ; but if it should appear that
there are, they may be obtained, and a much
greater I'um realized than is now thought ot, and
new burthens on the people to that amount may
be prevented.
FRIDAY, February 24.
A petition from A. M'Call, and others, nier

the officers of the treasury, of the tralifaction be

signed bv the Speaker.
The order of the day on the contested election
of the member for the lower diflritft of Georgia
being called for,
Mr. Wayne rose, and after observing that the
last postponement had not afforded fufficient time
to receive the evidence which he meant to bring
forward on this occasion, offered a resolution for
a further postponement to the Monday in
March next.
On -it was unanlmotifly voted that a
feat be assigned for the petitioner Mr. Jackson,
in which he might, either by himfelf, or his at
torney, flare his objections, if any, to a further
postponement.âMr. Jackson accordingly took a
feat withirMhe bar, and addrefling the chair, of
fered several objections to 9 further postpone
ment. To these objections Mr. Wayne replied ;
and after fundrv observations from various parts
of the House, the question on taking up the order
of the day was put and carried.
The resolution for a postponement was then
further discussed and amended, and finally agreed
to in the following words, viz.
" Refolded, That the trial of the contested
election of Anthony Wayne, returned as a mem
ber of this.House to represent the state of Geor
gia, be postponed to the second Monday in March
nexc " â36 members rose in favor of the motion.
, Mr:. Baldwin informed the House that he had
received certain papers relative to this election
from the fuprenje executive of the state of Geor
gia, which he aiked leave to lay on the table a
greeable to inftruciions.
Many objections were made to receiving these
papers from all parts of rhe House. Mr. Bald
win, after remarking that they contained many
documents which the house mult neceflarily re
cur to 111 the coot fe of the trialâand that he had
so far piirlued his inftruftions, as would fully
exculpate the executive of Georgia from any
charge ofremiflnefs in duty ontthe occasion, took
back the papers.
A report was received on the petitions of the
importers of teas from India, which was in favor

J put able houje in this city, received by the brig Pratt, Capt. Florence.
1 Referring to a few lines I wrote you two week-, âgo, by war
of Baltimore, I have now to add, that profpetfs here, in ajnioft
every respeCt, are daily growing more diflrelfing : the troops ex
petted from have not yet ariived, and the people are ai
moft ready to doubt their coming,
I am truly sorry that I, as well a* manv others, have been too
langtjine in my expe&aiions, refpe&ing matters being accommo
dated with the Blacks, because I am tearful it may have induced
you to adventure property to this port looner than you would,
other wife have done. The treaty with them is entirely laid aside
and they have again began depredations with additional vigour!
La ft week the Blacks revolted in .he neighbourhood ot Fort Dau
phin, and immediately putto death all the troops, fay fiam 40 t 0
50, that were stationed at a village about four leagues from that
P'W, and have deOroyed all the plantations in that quarter, except
very lew adjoining the town. Two nights ago we were exceed
ingly alarmed, at this place by a fevcre attack on the out polls of
this town, by**!e Blacks, who succeeded in getting possession of
one of the small forts, when they turned the guns on the town ;
but fortunately it was again retaken by a party of regular troops!
-ast night this town was again alarmed by small parties of Blacks
>ut were soon repulsed."
-xtrad of a letter from Cape Francois, dated January 23,1792.
ceivcd per brig Pratt, Capt. Florence.
The drums beating to arms Idil night was occasioned by the
negroes wading through the river, and surprizing a small fori ac
the hospital, which they took, and fired fevera (hot into the
town; fever a 1 whites were killed, and seven negroes taken pri
soners, fix of whom were hanged about 1 hours after, and one
brutally mangled by breaking his arms and legs, made fact to a
cross, and there left to die."

This proverbial faying is verified in the Philadelphia papew,
by the writings which of I.te have pointed out the ruioous eife&i
resulting from members of Congress being permitted to be Di
ridlors of thp National Bank. Many membejrs of the State Legif*
latures are Directors of the State Banksâand the propriety of their â¢
conduct has not been qucftioned. Have these fault-finders iuft re
ceived the gift of wildpm todifcern the evil tendency of Congress
men being Bank Directorsâand is that wisdom blind of one-,
\ eye, so that they can fee but half the evil ? It seems the Dite&oi* Â»
of the State Banks have the luck to stand on the blind fide of these
centinels for the public.
Congress has been wicked enough to fund the debtâand fa the -
horn is blowed, and the world summoned to arms to defend re
publican liberty which is finking under its enemies, the monied,
men. Congress is to answer for all ihis. But havernot feieral of the.
Stales evui gone beyond Congress, and given an additional two or
three per cent, to such of the creditors as hold the certificates of
thofe States ? These States, however, are innocent of this mifchiet;
and though what they have done may have increased the evil, the
whole fin lies at the door of Congress.âAnd what is the fin?
After keeping our creditors 12 or 14 yearsiuut of their dues, we .
prpmife to pay them 1 and to make the promise appear better than .
a score of old promises which we have broken, we fay, we pledge
certain revenues which lhall remain sacred to pay the intercflC
Yet for having done this, certain writers have seen fit to treat the -
government as bad as if it was managed by pickpockets. Thev
infmuate that the debt was not fiyided till it had changed haods.
If the funding ast was a long time delayed, after it was firft drÂ»
bated, it was not the fault of the advocates.of that act. They
would have been glad to hasten its passage. The length and vio.
lence of the debates spread through the country as general a know
ledge of the a& and its principles as can*be cxpefted to accom

r I 'HE SEAT of the late Docflor Lewis Johnflon,
dcceafed, in Perih-Amboy, containing TWO HUNDRED
ACRES of LAND.
This place is bounded southerly for near a mile on the river
Raruan, where it empties into the bay about 18 miles from Sandy-
Hook, and affords two moll agreeable situations for Gentlemeus'
Seats. There are now on it, two brick houses, wth gardens, and
a good colle&ion of fruit Trees of the best kinds. The land is very
fertiJe, and a great part ot it very good meadow ; and from its (itu
ation on the river, has the advantage of fifh of different kinds, in
their seasons, particularly of oysters and chicken clams, which may
be picked in great plenty on the fljts before the doors. It is a
delightful, healthy situation, capable of genteel and tasty improve
ments; and as Pirth-Amboy is one of the best sea-ports in the
United States, and within i 3 miles of the sea, the profpett ot its
'"ncreafing in value from that circumstance, is by no m-:ans incon
siderable.
There wil' also be fold, other Lots, within the bound"? of the
city, and about Five Hundred Acre* of Land on the opposite fide
of the river RaTitanâpart of which is improved by a farmâon
which there is a framed dwelling-house and barn, with an orchard
of grafted apple trees, and will contain about one hundred and
fifty acres ; the remainder will be fold in convenient lots, well
vooded and timbered, and verv convenient for supplying New-
York and other markers with fire-wood, timber tor ibip build
ing, and other uses, the transportation by water being easy and

ELEVEN ACRES of LAND, adjoining the above, the pro
perty of the Proprietors of E;ift New-Jersey, wheiecn the pro
prietary house lately stood. The eleg.int situation of this spot is
hardly to be equalled; it affords a grand profpeft of Raritan
Bay, and of the Bay formed by the waters of Raritan and Hud
son's rivers, where thÂ«y disembogue into the sea to the Eastâand
a most delightfnl one of the ferpenrne course of the Raritan river,
for several miles, through a rich tract of meadow to the Weft.
The gTeat quantity of stone neatly dressed, and brick, the remains
of the house lately burned, will be nearly fufficient for a new
building; and a large stone cistern, and well of.excellent w*trr,
with a very convenient stable and coach-house, will greatly lessen
the expence of putting the place in order for the residence of a
Gentleman.âThere are tew situations so eligible, particularly Â»ru
the summer seasonâwhen the cool sea breezes, and fUvated
situations, render them places of pleasing retreat, from the confine
