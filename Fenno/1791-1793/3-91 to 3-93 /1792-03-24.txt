PARIS, November 24
The difcuffioii and amendment of the decree
relative to the refratftory priests, (till occupies
the augutt aflembly of tiiis nation.âEvery arti
Â«le, every letter is cavilled atâbut the article
which hits caused the greatelt riot and tumult in
the senate, is that which suppresses even the
traces of the ancient denomination of the cler
gy. Mankind are naturally attached to their
old prejudicesâand you will divelt a pried of
the title of citizen with more ease than you will
persuade him he is not a member of the clergy.
The bishop of Lyons, in opposing this extra
ordinary meal'ure, delivered one of the most elo
quent orations 1 ever heardâllo pedantryâllo
tricks of prieltcraft. The language was that of
a philol'opherâa manâand a good citizen â bold,
nervous, and full of found argument. â" He de
clared, that if such an ediift was palled, it would,
on the one part, inspire in the people an indif
fe ence for religion, which in the annals of the
world had been ever changing. On the other,
it would aid the powerful effort of Theism, to ef
tablilh itl'elf upon the shattered ruins of the gos
pel. Religion he revered. Theology was an
ariitocratic work, framed out of the religion of
the golpel, which is more democratic than the
conltitution. Realon, as it became more enlight
ened, separated by its beams the brilliancy of
religion from the midll of theology, whose era
die 1 firtt find in the hands of Contrantine." This
speech applauded with enthusiasm, was ordered
the honors of itnpreflion, and the article was ad
journed, fine die.
The remainder of the decree Was read over,
and concluded yesterday with the ofual tumult,
not unlike Homer's fubli me image of the Greeks,
rulhmg to council ; or the Trojans' (hout when
they gave battle, which was keener than the
screams of a million of cranes before an approach
ing storm.
Six millions more of aflignats are to be burnt'
this week, which will make the whole number
already destroyed, amount to 336 millions.

The Commons being come thither accordingly,
his Majesty was pleased to make the following

I have directed copies of the definitive treaty,
between the Emperor and the Porte, to be laid

I regret that I aiÂ» not yet enabled to inform
you of the termination of the war in India ;
but the success which has lately attended the dif
tingnifhed bravery and exertions of the officers
and troops under the able condutfl of Lord Corn
wallis, and the recent advices from that quarter,
afford reasonable ground to hope that the war may
be speedily brought to an honorable conclusion.
The friendly afTurances which 1 receive from
foreign powers, and the general state of affairs
in Europe, appear to promise to my subjects the
continuance of their present tranquility. Un
der these circumstances I am induced to think
that some immediate reduction may fafely be
made in our naval and military elta'blifhments ;
and my regards for the interests of iny fubjeds
renders me at all times desirous of availing iny
felf of any faYorable opportunity to diminish the
public expences.
Gentlemen of the House Â»j Commons,
It will, I am persuaded, give you great fatis
faCtion to learn, that the extraordinary expelle
es incurred in the course of last year, have in a
great measure been already defrayed by rhe
grants of the felfion. The state of our resources,
will, I trust, be found more than lufficient to pro
vide for the remaining part of those expenses, as
well as for the current service of the year, the
estimates for which I have direrted to be laid be
fore you.
1 entertain the pleasing hope, that the reduc
tions which may be found practicable in the
eitablifhmenrs, and the continued encreafe of the
reveniie, will enable you, after making due pro
vision for the l'everal branches of the public ser
vice, to enter upon upon a system of gradually
relieving my fubjetfts from some part of the ex
iting taxes, at the fame time giving additional
efficacy to the plan for the redut'fion of the nati
onal debt, on the success of which our future eaf;
and security eflei.tially depend.
With a view to this important obje<2, let me
also recommend it to you to turn your attention
to the consideration of such measures as the date
of the funds and of public credit may render
practicable and expedient towards a reduction
in the rate of interett of aoy of the annuities
which are now redeemable.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
The continued aud progreflive improvement
in the interna] situation of the country, will, I
am confident, animate you in the pursuit of" eve
ry measure which may be conducive to the pub
lic interest.
It muil at the fame time operate as the rtrong
eft encouragement to a spirit of ufeful iiuluftiy
among ail ilafles of my fubjeÂ«fts, and above all,
muii confirm and encieafe their steady and zea
lous attachment to that conllitution, which Â«e
have found by long experience, to unite the in
estimable blelfings of liberty and order, and to
which, under the favor of providence, all our
other advantages are principally to be ascribed.

BANK OF SCOTLAND.
Monday, there was a very refpeftable and nu
merous meeting of the Proprietors of the Hank
of Scotland, who unanitnuufly agieed to apply
to Parliament for leave to bring in a bill to allow
the Proprietors to augment their capiial Itock
from three hundred thousand to fix hundred
thousand pounds Sterling.
i he Bank of Scotland was conflituted, by ai'l
of Parliament, before the Union (anno. 1695)
and is the firft and only Bank in Scotland etta
blifhed by authoriiy of Parliament. It has been
ot great utility, by its branches, in promoting
trade, manufactures, and agriculture, in differ
ent pans of the country. When the augmenta
tion takes place, the Bank will be enabled to ex
tend its credit still farther, so as to meet the de
mands which the great iucreafe of trade, manu
factures, and agriculture, requires, and thus be
come more extensively ufeful.

The committee of supply reported, that thay

ROMAN CATHOLICS
Sir Hercules Langrilhe rose to introduce his
" bill for removing certain reftridtions that af
fetft the Roman Catholics."âThe sum of all the
privileges they had obtained, was :
The full enjoyment of property,
The free exercise of religion,
And the guardianfbip of their children.
But their good conduct deserved further fa
vorâand to what they already enjoyed, he pro
posed to add :
A power to educate their children at home, by
taking away the oaths which prevented their re
ceiving acedemic degrees.
To allow them the practice and the profeffion
of the law.
To allow them to intermarry with protestants ;
and
To remove their present inability of taking
apprentices
Kor these purposes he moved for leave to bring
in a bill.
Right Hon. Mr. Hobart seconded the motion.
some debate, the queflion was pfit and
leave unanimously given to bring in the bill.
Mr. o'Hara, then presented a petition, pray
ing to allow Roman Catholics to be admitted in
;otl;e armyâinto places in the revenue, and the
:atv âand into places of trust and profit.
The petition was nniverfally reprobated, anj
was at length withdrawn by Mr. O'Hara.
During Ihe debate, a Uranger was observed

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY,- February 16.
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
On the Rsprefentation Bill.
MR. VINING's proposition under confedera
tionâthe fir ft article of which is, that New-
Hampshire shall be entitled to J Representatives â
this being read by the Chairman.
Mr. Livermore rose in support of the general
of the propositionâwhich is to appor
tion the representatives agreeable to the aggre
gate number of the people of the United Statesâ
he urged in brief, the arguments which had be
fore been adduced on the importance of making
the representation as equal as poflible, and con
eluded with faying, he hoped that the number
proposed for New-Hamplhire (five) would be a
greed to.
Mr. Baldwin said, that if New-Ham pfliire should
have five members, Georgia, according to its pre
sent number, which is about one half of that of
New-Hampfliire, would be entitled tothreeâbut
thi* is not proposed ; nor do the members from
that ftalfe expecft it (honld be.
Mr. Kittera observed, that apportioning repre
sentatives to the state of Virginia, 011 the princi
ple contended for by the gentleman from New-
Hampfbire, would give Virginia 24 members.
Mi". Niles supported the proposition.â He urg
ed that the fractions would be dimitiiibed on the
whole by itâand tho' perfe<ft equality is not at
tainable, he could not conceive on what gentle
men founded their opposition to that plan which
came the nearefttothis equalityâand asthe con-
Hitution fully warrants oil a liberal, tho' ftritftly
just conftrurtion, the apportionment now contem
plated, he hoped it would be agreed to.
Mr. Madifen repeated the substance of what he
had before offered in objetftion to this proposition.
Fractions will exist, said he, on every poflible
planâthis is to be a permanent lawâand in its
operation will probably increase those fractions.
The conftilution refers to the refpec r tSve numbers
of the states, and not to any aggregate number.
The proposition break* down the barriers between
the state and general governments, and involves
a consolidation.
Mr. Livermore replied to Mr. Kittera.âHeob
ferved that if Virginia was represented agreeable
to the proposition contemplated for New-Hamp
ihire, that is four members, Virginia would be
entitled to only feventeen âthis would appear on
calculation.
Mr. Williamfon contended that, by the consti
tution, whaieveV ratio was adopted, it is to be ap
plied as a divisor to the number of persons in each
state refptÃively. This idea of an aggregate num
ber, looks like a confolidatlon of the government;
not only so, but the supplementary member pro
posed for those dates who had not inhabitants to
vote for such supplementary member, would not
be elecfted agreeable to the conftitiitiou.
Mr. Seney opposed the proposition.âHe ob
served that it was very extraordinary indeed that
those persons who, in the previous difcuflion,
â were opposed to the ratio of 30,000, on account
of giving so Urge a representation, should now
advocate this proposition, which, in fart.entreafes
the whole number. He hoped that it would be
rejected.
Mr. Vining said a few words to exculpate the
friends of the proposition from the charge of in
eonfiftency.
Mr. Venable stated various particulars tofhew
that the plan of transferring the fractions from
one (late to another, comparing them with the
general ratio, would produce greater inequality
than the plan contended for by thofc whooppofe
the present motion.
Mr. Livermore juftified himfelf from tliecharge
of inconfiflencyâhe was always in favor of an
equal representationâwith this he began, and
â with this he (hould end â and he was: not folicit
otis which way the vote determined the matter,
provided the principle of 5 equality was adhered
toâand therefore he should not regret N. Ham p
fhire being reftridted to 4inembers, provided Vir
ginia had only 17 ; which is the highest number
{he will be entitled to, apportioning them agree
able to four for New-Hamp(hire. He observed
that the friends of the proposition might be out
voted by numbersâhe wiflied, if i: could be done
that they might be outreafoned as well as out
numbered.
Mr. Lawrance said, having advocated in a for
jner discussion rhe iat id of 30,000, he hoped he
ihctild not be charged with inconsistency if lie
gave his a (lent to the present propositionâas he
had explicitly declared that he advocated that
number, as giving the largest representationâ
and this propoficioH not only preserved that idea,
but enhanced the number, and on more equal
principles, he then entered into an examina
tion of the clause in the constitution respecting
taxes and representatives, which it is expi'Msly
declared shall be according to numbers. He re
probated the idea of members considering thetn
felvesas representatives merely of particular parts
ot the Union. The members of this house, Cud
he, are the representatives of America. The
dates, as states, are represented in the Senate.
A membe- of this house from Georgia, is a repre
sentative of the state of New-York, as much as
if he came from the latter rtate. Conceiving the
idea of the meaning of the constitution which he
had given to be just, he fliould vote for the pro
position.
Mr. Findley said he (hould vote against the pro
positionâ he did not like the principle of it, if it
had anyâhe rather thought it was destitute of
all principle, for it content plates no ratio at allâ.
it is rather an arbitrary apportionment of the
representation.
Adverting to the article refpedling taxation,
he observed that the proposition does not accord
with the idea of the gentlemen who advocate it,
for flill there will be fractions leftâand, said he,
are not these fratfions to be taxed ?
In reply to Mr. Lawrance's remarks refpeifting
local representation, he observed that the gentle
man's idea proved too much ; for if the idea of
representing local intereds is dedroyed, the es
sence of representation is done away altogether,
and all responsibility is loft.
Mr. Ames.âThe Conditution fays, tliat " Re
" prefentatives and diredt taxes shall be appor
" tioned among the several dates, which may be
" included within this union, according to their
" refpeiftive numbers." &c. &c.
" The number of reprefeinatives (hall not ex
" ceed one for every thirty thonfand, but each
" (late shall have at lead one representative."
Dedu(slions from the above.
id. You may not exceed one to 30,00 c
2d. You may have as many as one to 30,000 of
the whole number of the Union.
3d. Supposing the amendment ratified, you must
haveiooineinbers,if oneto 30,000wi1l give them
These principles were not disputed [ill lately.
But it is now pretended that the ratio may be ap
plied to each ltate, and the number of represent
atives no more than the multiples of 30,000 in
each state- Some even go so far as to fay that it
muji be so applied, and that Congress may n*t
have as many members as one to 30,000 of the
whole Union.
This conftrudtion leeins to be violent
1 ft. The word reprefentaiives, firft used, can
only mean the whole number of representatives
âfor they are to be apportioned amoug the se
veral stares. The word is used in the fame sense
afterwards, " The number of representatives
fhal 1 no exceed one to 30,000," again meaning
the whole nnmberofreprefentatives. ThewWf
number of representatives shall not exceed one
to. 30,000 of the whole people. To avoid thia ob
vious meaning, they fay it (hould read, " (hall
not exceed one to 30,000 in each /late." These
words are supplied wholly without authority.
2d. The clause merely restrains the number
of representatives, so as not to exceed one to
30,000. The members in Congress might have
been increased to any number, had not this re
ftritftion existed. It is a reftritfiive, and not an
explanatory clause. It curtails, but cannot be
supposed to change the natural import of the
preceding power. It is against the fair rules of
conftrutftion so to change it.
3d. The sense is perfect without the words one to
30,000 in each Jlate. ExprefTum facit ceflare tacitu.
4 r â¢>â¢ The conftru(stion makes tautology. The
fir 11 clause having directed the manner of appor
tioning representatives among the several Hates
according to their refpetfive numbers, might
have been wholly omitted, one to 30,000 in each
jlate being a final apportionment.
ith. Words mult not be fupplicd by con/fruffion
repugnant to words expreded. The refultof an
apportionment according to numbers as firft di
rected by the constitution, differs in terms from
a ratio of one to 30,000 in. each slate. It differs
in its operation no less. The members in the
next house will be 113 âApportion them accord
ing to numbers among the (everal states, Virgi
nia would have 19 â19 being to 113, as 630,000
the numbers of Virginia, to 3,619,000 the whole
people of the United States. But by the con-
Itruction which supplies the words'in each (late,
(he will have 21 members.
6ih. ] he words one to 30,000, are merely re
ft 1 ktive ot the number in Congrefi from the
whole people, and do not change the sense of
the fiiil clause, for taxes and representatives are
to be apportioned according ro numbers. The
conftroiSion cannot be extended to tjw;es with
any goou sense. Yet as taxes and representatives
are to be apportioned the conftruiftion
378
applying to the one, (hould apply to the otVr.
Yet the ad vocates of this conftrutfion fay, that
taxes shall be imposed according to numbers, and
not the multiples of 30,000 in eac(j Hate. Tak
ing it for proved that the sense of tire firft clause
is not changed, but its operation limitted by the
clause shall not exceed one to 30,000. It remains
to fee what is the sense of the firlt clause (land
ing alone. " Reprefentaiives (hall be apporti
oned among the several dates according to their
refpedtive numbers." The rule of three will
(hew the the number of members any state is en
titled toâThus, as the whole number 3,619,000
is to the number of the next house 113 âso isthe.
number of persons in a state, f?y Virginia, which
are 630,000, to her quota of members. The re
fultis 19 members. The bill pursuing another
rule, obtafned as we have seen by a forced cou
ftrutlion, gives that state 21 members.
7th. The amendment to the constitution re
futes the sense of the conftrufHon. The words
arc " there (hall be one for every 30,000 till the
number (hall amount to 100." Plainly the whole
number of the nation is intended. The whole
number is to be formed by one for every 30,000.
The words contended for are therefore exclud
ed, and no conftrudiion will avail in this place
to add them.
Bth. The ratio of one to 30,000 in each state
is inconsistent with this amendment. For ac
cording to that, 3,000,000 of persons mull have
100 members in Congress. Had the numbers by
the census fallen (hor: of a surplus bey ond 3 mil
lions fuflficient to cover the fra<flions orloft num
bers, this amendment to the constitution could
not be carried into execution, according to the
principles of the bill. For the amendment re
quiring 100 members, the numbers being more
than 3,000,000, it would appear that roo mem
bers could not be obtained by applying the ratio
of 30,000 to the numbers in each state, instead of
taking the entire number of the Union. Heie
then would be a conftitntional obligation to have
100 members in Congress, and an abfoluteimpof
fibilitv of having them according to the princi.
pies of this bill.
loth. The number of representatives is limit
ed not to exceed one for 30,Â«00. Purfnethe let
ter of the constitution and avoid all conftru'ftiot),
t e number of representatives will be 120. A
dopt the conftrtiiflion that you are to have no
more than one to 30,000 will give you, and you
bring down (he number to 113.
But this process, erroneous as it is, only fixes
the numberâit does not apportion them. 1 hat
should be done according to numbers, and Vir
ginia would not be found entitled to 21 of 113-
According to the principle of the bill ; if it may
be called a principle, it is defective. The let
ter and true intention of the constitution will be
violated by a forced conftru<ftion, which gives
forrve states more and others less than their due
(hire of the representatives.

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
There is a natural propensity in mankind to extravaganceâevery
obje& of pursuit, whether of pleasure or profit, however mode,
rarely it may engage our attention atfirft, is ultimately over-rated ;
the consequence is difappoi.umentand vexation.
It is difficult to reltrain an ardent disposition ; when
extraordinary luccefs appears to crown the enterprizes of daring
adventurersâand hence we may observe, thai while but few have
wisdom and prudence fufficient to withftaod the treacherous but
fafcinating faults of fortuneâthe greater part of the world are
either drawn into her deftru&tve vortex of fpeculatton, or fuffer
at least a temporary chagrin from the apparent luccefs of her har
dy votaries.â Wha an nftru&ive fchoo] is that of experience ! â
Happy are those who profit by the fuffeiings of othersâand re
p-effing the risings of envy, enjoy in peace and gratitude the solid
and substantial fruits of patient and pcrfevering mduftry.
" In the sweat of thy brow (halt th#u eat bread."âWhat a per
petual itruggle is maintained to obviate this ancient declaration !
What a numerous generation of mendicants has it given life to!
and how many millions, the produce of haid industry, arc year Iy
extorted from the hand of diligence by the cunning and unprin
cipled disciples of idlenels ! The charity that is bellowed on un
woithy obje&s, if properly applied, would alleviate, and a I molt
annihilate the miseries of the truly untoriunate sons and daughters
of affliction. The mod competent charity is that which guarci>
the avenues of dillrefs. Inttitutions, therefore, which place the
human mind in a capacity to acquire ufeful knowledge, are justly
to be conhdered as the result of the moll sublime policy and be
nevolence. On these principles wc may determine, chat a people
are enlightened in proportion to the provision which they make
for the u.ftfnfclion ot lhe whole body of the people, in such
branches of education as arc essential Co constitute a free, an inde
pendent and happy community.

miles. The farm is divided by the main ftrert leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearlv
equal in quantity; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by ihe said street on the east, and by the nver on

rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleating view of
the rivr r, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
