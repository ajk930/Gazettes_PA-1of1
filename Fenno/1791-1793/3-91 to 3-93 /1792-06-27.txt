HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
WEDNESDAY, April 25.
In committee of the whole, on the 2d JrMion of the bill
for calling forth the militia.
The amendment providing for the Prdfident's
ifluing a proclamation, tinder consideration.
MR. GOODHUE observed that the amend
ment appeared to him to require lome
amendment; for an inlurre&ion may happen
in a remote part of the union, and all the mif
chief compleated before this proclamation could
reach the spot.
Mr. Fitzfunons oblerved that the proclama
tion could reach the scene of adtion as soon as
the order fVom the President for calling forth
the militia couldâtherefore the objection ap
plies to other parts of the bill.
Mr. Mercer supported the amendment, on
precedent and by arguments drawn from fadts
and experience.
Mr. Livermore obje&ed generally to any a
mendment to the bill; he doubted whether the
Legislature of the United States had a right to
authorize the President to call forth the militia,
till some real neceflity for the measure should
exist.
Mr. Clark enquired whether the United States
have a right to call on the justices of the peace
to execute the laws of Congress-âis they have
no such right, the amendment so far as it ref
pedts those officers is nugatory.
Mr. White was in favor of the clause gene
rallyâbut said he had no idea that the general
government had any right to call on the officers
of the particular States to execute the laws of
the Union.
Mr. Gerry adverting to several parts of the
constitution observed, that nothing could be
plainer than this, that the general government
had a right to require the alfiftance >Â»f the of
ficers of the several State governments; for
they have severally taken an oath to support
the constitution of the United States.
Mr. Kitterra opposed the amendment, be
thought the tendency of it, so far from operat
ing to suppress infurredtions would produce
them in a much grcacer degree. He objected
particularly to that part of the clause which re
quired the proclamations being read in the hear
ing of the infurgent r âhe believed it was true
that no advantage had everinfatftrefulted from
the practice,
It W25 then voted to strike out the latter
part of the amendment which refpetts calling
on the justices of the peace or the judges to
read the proclamation.
The process bill being brought in engrolTed,
and read, before the filling up the blanks Mr.
Mercer moved to re-commit the bill, in order
to reltoring an amendment disagreed to in the
House*. which had passed unanimously in the
committee of the whole ; this amendment was
to strike out the clause that authorizes the cre
ditor to pursue his a<stipn till a tender of the

UNE 27, I 792.
| debt and cofb, in p;old or silver is made. This
I motion was founded on the particular circuui
' stances ot* persons indebted to foreignersâit
was laid that the lav/ with this claule in it,
would annihilate the power of the several States
,to pass insolvent lawsâand in consequence,
those unfortunate debtors would be entirely in
the power of a let of persons who retained the
molt rancorous enmity against the revolution,
and the persons molt conspicuous in their exer
tions tu bring about that event. It was fur
ther laid, that it vests a power in a merciless
creditor to immure an unfortunate debtor
within the walls of a prison for life j it con
found", the unfortunate, with the vicious and
abandonedâand extends a regulation deligned
originally merely to produce a full discovery
and delivery of all the debtor's property, to a
most unrighteous and unreasonable punilliment,
to the Ihortening of life, and to the injuring of
society. It was further observed that its ope
ration would place the citizens of the United
States upon a very different footing from En
glifli debtors who owe money to the citizens of
the United States ; the treaty of peace which
had been mentioned was concluded during the
existence of those laws under which the Britilh
debtors enjoyed privileges which will by no
means be reciprocal, Ihould this clause be re
tained. It was alio observed that if this law
was pa(Ted, it would not be in the power of the
Legillature to provide a remedy, as it would be
an expoft fa&o lawâit would place the debt
ors in a much worse lituation than they were
in at the time the contracts were madeâby
giving these foreign creditors an advantage
which they did not contemplate at the time
when the credit was given.
In opposition to the motion for recommitting
the bill, it was contended that the creditors al
luded to, had not discovered that rancorous and
cruel disposition, in at least some of the States,
which had been complained ofâbut on the con
trary had treated their debtors in the molt hu
mane and generous manner ; the provision con
templated by the bill is precisely the fame with
that contained in a law which has twice re
ceived the fan&ion of Congress under the new
constitutionâos which no complaint had ever
been madeâthat to prescribe a different rule
would excite great alarms and be attendedwith
enibarrafTments and perhaps with injury to the
debtor as well as to the creditor : To leave it
optional with the debtor to fay in what manner
he will pay his debtsâor to fubjedt the creditor
to the caprice of the several State governments
whose laws may be founded on very opposite
principles, will put it out of his power to get
his debts paid agreeable to the treaty of peace;
and therefore will be a virtual infraction of
that treatyâthe provision it was said, is ftri<ft
ly conformable to the letter of the
uniformity in connection with justice was a
principal object contemplated by the constitu
tionâthis was considered as one of its chief ex
cellenciesâbut to fay that foreign creditors
shall be fubjefted to the legislative provisions of
the several States which are known to clash,
some of which have made paper a tenderâother s
of which have depreciated paper in circulation,is
to defeat every juftexpectation,founded on the
treaty of peace and the constitution. It was
urged that this clause ought to be retained on
every principle of uniformity as a general pro
vision. Nor could it be considered as an ex
post fatto law, fmce every contract would re
main as it was, and always be determined ac
cording to its own principles, except by mutual
consent this general provision should be resort
ed to.
THE AMERICAN FARMER.
GOOD and evil are to be found in all socie
ties, and it is in vain to seek for any spot
where those ingredients are not mixed. I
therefore reft fatisfied, and thank God that my
lot is to be an American farmer, instead of a
Ruffian boor or an Hungarian peasant.
It is strange that misery, when viewed in
others, should become to us a fort of real good;
though I am far from rejoicing to hear that there
are in the world men so thoroughly wretchcd.
They are no doubt asharmlefs, industrious, and
willing to work as we are. Hard is their fate
to be thus condemned to slavery worse than that
of our negroes. Yet, w hen young, 1 entertain
ed some thoughts of felling my farm : I thought
it afforded but a dull repetition of the fame la
bors and pleasures. I thought the former tedi
ous and heavy; the latter, few and insipid. But,
when I came to consider myfelf as divested of
my farm, I then found the world so wide, and
every place so full, that I began to fear left the re
would be no room for me. My farm, mvhoufe,
my barn, presented to my imagination, objects
from which I adduced quite new ideas, they
were more forcible than before. Why Ihould
not I find myfelf happy, said I, where my father
was before ? He left me no good books, it is
true; he gave me no other education than the
arts of reading and writing; but he left me a
good farm, and his experience: he left me free
from debts, and no kind of difficulties to strug
gle with. I married, and this perfectly recon
ciled me to my iituation. IVly wife rendered
my house all at once chearful and pleasing ; it
no longer appeared gloomy and solitary as be
fore. When I _ went to work in my fields, I
[Whole No. 550.]
worked with more alacritv and fprightlinefs.
I feit that I did not v. ork for myl'elf alone, and
this encouraged me much. My wife would of
ten come with her knitting in her hand, and lit
under the fliady tree, praising the ftraightncls
of my furrows, and the docility of my hor/es.
This swelled my heart, and made every thing
ligUt and plealant, and I regretted that J had
not married before. I feit myfelf happy in my
new situation, and where is that station which
can confer a more fubitantial system of felicity
than that of an American farmer, pofie fling
freedom of action and thoughts, ruled by a mode
of government which requires but little from
us? I owe nothing but a pepper corn to my
country, and due refped. 1 know no landlord
but the Lord of all Land) to whom I owe the
most sincere gratitude. My father left me
three hundred and seventy-one acres of land,
i forty-feven of which are good timothy meadow,
an excellent orchard, a good house, and a fub
ltantial barn. It is my duty to think how happy
lam that he lived to build and to pay for ail
these improvements. What are the labors
which I have to undergo ? What are my fa
tigues when compared to his, who had every
thing to do, from the firft tree he felled, to the
finilhing of his house ? Every year I kill from
1,500 to 2,00~> weight of pork, 1,200 of beef,
half a dozen of good wethers in harvefl; of
fowls my wife has always a grea* flock ; what
can I wish more? My hired labourers are faith
ful and healthy. By a long series of industry
and honest dealings, my father left behind hiin
the name of a good man. I have but to tread
his paths to be happy and a good man like him.
I know enough of the law to regulate my little
concerns with propriety, nor do I dread its
power. These are the grand outlines of my
situation J but as I can feel much more than I
am able to express, I hardly know how to pro
ceed.
When my firft Ton was born, the whole train
of my ideas were suddenly altered- Never was
there a charm that aÂ£ted so quickly and pow
erfully. I ceased to ramble in imagination
through the wide world. My excursions, since,
have not exceeded the bounds of my farm ; and
all my principal pleasures are now centered
within its scanty limits; but, at the fame time,
there is not an operation belonging to it in
which I do not find some food for ufeful reflec
tions. Yet how rude must the feelings of the
farmer be who daily holds the ax or the plough !
How much more refined, on the contrary, those
of the European, whose mind is improved by
education, example, books, and by every ac
quired advantage 1 Those feelings however, I
will delineate as well as 1 can. When I con
template my wife, by my fire fide, while she ci
ther spins, knits, darns, or nurses otir child, I
cannot describe the various emotions of love,
or gratitude, of conscious pride, which thrill in
my heart, and often overflow in involuntary
tears. I feel the necessity, the sweet pleasure,
of a&ing my part, the part of a husband and fa
ther, with an attention and propriety which
may entitle me to my good fortune.
It is true, these pleasing images vanish with
the fmokc of my pipe, but, though they disap
pear from my mind, the impreilion they have
made on my heart is indelible. When I play
with the infant, my warm imagination runs
forward, and eagerly anticipates his future
temper apd constitution. I would willingly
open the book of fate, and know in which page
his deiliny is delineated. Alas ! where is the
father, who, in those moments of paternal.ex
tacy can delineate one half of the thoughts
which dilate his heart ? I am sure I cannot.
Then again I fear for the health of those who
are become so dear to me ; and in their fick
nefles, Ifeverely pay for the joys I experienced
while they were well. Whenever I go abroad
it is always involuntary. 1 never return home
without feeling some pleasing emotion, which i
often suppress as useless and foolifh. The in
stant I enter on my land, the bright idea of pro
perty, of exclusive right, of independence, ex
alt my mind. Precious foil, I fay to myfelf,
by what singular custom of law is it that thou
waft made to constitute the riches of the free
holder ? What ihould we American fanners be
without the diftinft poflelfion of that foil ? It
feeds, it clothes us ! from it we draw even a
great exuberancy, our best meat, our richest
drink ; the very honey of our bees comes from
this privileged spot. No wonder we should
thus cherilh its pofleilion; no wonder that so
many Europeans, who have never been able to
lay that l'uch portion of land was Cneirs, croft
the Atlantic to realize that happiness ! This
formerly rude foil has been converted by my
father into a pleasant farm, and, in return, it
has established all our rights. On it is founded
our rank, our freedom, our power, as citizens j
our importance, as inhabitants of such adiftrift.
These images, 1 mud coi:fe{s ? I always behold
with pleasure, and extend them as far as my
imagination can reach ; for this is what may
be called the true and the only philosophy of an
American fanner.

THE loliesof this empire fuilained
by the late bloody and expensive
war, scarce half a century, supposing
in at peace so long, would hardly be
able to reiifcburfe. But our troubles
are yet at an endâthough releas
ed frafti the war with Aultria and
Ruflia, the Ottoman Government,
trom the revolt of numerous Pachas,
is likely to be plunged into thegieat
elt embarralimenis, if not 111 complete
ruin. The principal of tliele revol
ters is Her '1 imur Khan, who, after
jnuitering the Province he command
ed, is now rapidly marching towards
Bagdat, at the head of an iinmenle
army. Several Egyptian Beys have
alio wrenched the 'command from
those Who governed under the Grand
Seignior; and the son of the late Pa
cha of Annappa, who was put to
death by order of the Purie,"and his
head Cent to Constantinople, is de
vatlating the whole country of Cuban
and Caucasus. These dilallers have
occasioned the Divan to afleuible for
several days palt in order to dcvil'e

WARSAW, March 20.
The fitting of the Diet, which is
just begun, is rendered nufpicious by
the unanimity with which the Die
tines have approved and accepted
the conltitution of May 3, I 791. The
Marlhal of the Crown, in a very ele
gant speech, congratulated the Afleqi
bly and the Nation up.oll the harmo
ny which fublilted in the realm, in
which he said the finger of Provi
dence was so vilible, that he could
do no less than propose the 3d of
May next, to be celebrated in the molt
solemn manner as a day of thnnkf
giving, and that on that day the ift
ltone us a church Ihould be laid to be
consecrated to Divine Providence.
To render the ceremony the more
augult, M. Malachoufky proposed,
that the Deputies lent by the Die
tines to present thanks for the new
conltitution be received that day.
Prince Sapieha, Marflial of Lithua
ilia supported the proposals of his
colleague in a speech more energetic,
if pollible, than that of the Marfiial
of t,he Crown, in which he expatiat
ed at large upon the ellablilhment
of the new conltitution without trou
ble or bloodlhed ; and after acknow
ledging the obligations that the na
tion is under to the King (next to the
supreme Being) he thanked his Ma
jelty particularly on the part of his
province, and allured him that Li
thuania would yield to no part of the
realm in attachment, fidelity and gra-
titude
COPENHAGEN, March 17,
Bvlhe late accounts from St. Croix,
in the \Ve(t-lndies, we learn that the
abundant rains which have fallen in

of a plentiful crop of lugar, which is
already calculated at 17,0c0 hogs
heads. The importation during the
five latl years from Saint-Croix, into

from Maiihal Luckner, complain

been made from his army, and the
various articles that were wanting to
enable him to art, in cafe of a war,
with the neceflary vigour and promp

The minister then dated the mea

given, previous to the arrival of the
General's letter, to remove the caus

that no public creditor shall be enti

that another citizen might have been

to the new order of things. I hope,
therefore, I ihall be exculed for be

The allembly ordered the minister's
speech to be printed, and afterwards
diltributed throughout the kingdoir,.
DUBLIN, April 18.
The French have deliberated long
on the call of the public for war ;
but that they will go intothecountry
of their enemies if war should be de
termined, is certain. They expert
to conquer with their swords, and to
win the nations by their opinions.
Polyglott editions of the French con
ltitution, are now printing to a great
extent in Paris, and thele are to be
circulated wherever the French ar
mies go. A volley of tlieui, thePari
lians lay, will be more dangerous to
del'potil'm, than the fire of all the ar
tillery in Europe.

one mile in circumference, totally
disappeared, a cavern having opened
and Jwallowed it in. This body of

EDINBURGH, April 12.
Scotland in general, and Edin

was not for the high price of provi

American and French nations : Thus
linked together, in spite of the dis

have but one and the fame spirit, and
will be in no competition but in those
virtues, which the love of liberty and

" Eveiy man, who is able to tell
that two'and' two make four, mull
fee that Congress have given great
encouragement to American fruit and
â¢jrain spirits, by the excise-law. h'o
reign grain spirits are to pay twenty,
eight cents per gallon, and foreign
spirits of all other kinds twenty-five
cents per gallon, though spirits made
of fruit and grain in the United
States are to pay only seven cents.
The lead difference is eighteen cents
.âaverage duty of foreign spirits be
fore the adoption of the federal con
ltitution was not more than fix cents
upon foreign, so that the least differ
ence against foreign spirits is now
twelve cents more than it used to be itn~
der the State Governments.âCongress
have made a difference in favour of
Spirits made of native materials, by
laying three cents more on Moiafles-

couragement to Spirits made out of the

from foreign materials."

MR. TEN NO,
HPHOSE who peruse your paper with impani-
X alityobferve, that you never appear to be il
liberal exc*pi when yÂ° Ll inadvertently adopt fen
tirnents, or make quotations from the National
Gazette.â What you remarked the other day in
refpe&to foreigners, was not ftri&ly proper or de
cent ; but con(idering from whom the sentiment
was borrowed, you had reason to suppose it would
be agreeable. In this you were mifbken. A Bof
tonian h-s no privilege to attack or even to retort
upon othersâhe ought always (ilently to suss i
abuse. The Gazette of June 25th, has justly re
proached you for applying to your political oppo
ncuts the precise terms which they constantly be
stow upon the mod rcfpc&able chara&ers. In
llead of following their example, it may be ufeful
for you to consider, that a gentleman can have no
fufl&cient apology for adopting scurrilous language
on any occasion. Even a scurrilous reproof of
lucli indiscretions will be read with pleasure, efpe
cully if it be consentaneous with the character of
its authot, and do not offend against those princi
ples of unity, congruity and delign, which are ca
pable of beiiowing a kind of beauty on objects
which, feparatcly considered, arc hateful and de
formed. A. B.

A committee of the Colonial Assembly, about
the middle ot May, reported the plan ot a Con

do not give a copy of it. The Assembly have
begun to dtfcufs us merits; but their proceedings,
owing to the relludtious laid on the pieU, do not
appear.
Some ilir has been made in the AfTcmbly, to
render its operations independent ot the National
Assembly, by reprefvnting that it has not the
right to repeal the conUitutioual law of the 28i.fi
of Sept. which rcfpe&s the Colonies ; and that,
the Colonial Assembly, holding its powers as the
National Assembly Goes from the Conflituting
Assembly, will acknowledge no other law as then
guide, in enathug thole concerning the internal
government ot bairit-Domingo, than the coniti

fill their places by hired freemen. Ke repreferited,
in support ot this plan, domestic slaves as the
cause of the present diftui bances, from the oppor

the population of whites by this means, and there
by opposing, with more torce, any attempts ol

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
It is remarkable that all the recent com
plaints refpe&ing the excise, originate at the
feat of government; the complexion and fea
tures of these complaints are so finiilar, that it
is taking no great rifqne to pronounce them all
the illegitimate offspring of one family, if not of
one parent âbut the public may reft affiired,
that these paper puppets are not supported by
31
correfpmding production: from thole parts of
the levtral slates which are principally interest-;
ed in the business. Accounts from various j
quarter, particularly from the southward, in-;
dijjatefuch an acquiescence in the lav/, as mufti
Compltatly dilappomt the hopes and wiihes of*
those vho take so much pains to brew mifchief.
A piragraph in the National Gazette of June
i3ih, announced that " the canker worms" in Mal
fachufrtu and Connecticut, had formed a " pow
erful confederacy" against the " eajlern cxcij'e,"
and vere manifefting " their wrath and indigna
tion" against the law, by " making dreadful ra
vagesamong the apple trees" in that quarte.
It s ftrangc, fays a corrcfpondent, that men
who Â«n all occzfions boafl of their own extraordi
nary jihilanthiopy, should behold their neighbor's
crup? destroyed with malignant fatisfattion. The
plea/Ure refilling from such fentimcnts,. and the
hjonof of being airociated in politics with "canker
worms" ate not envied by the people of New-
England.
As the ravages of these infe&s have in some
measure ceased, it is recommended to those whole
genius and education have rendered them wile
and learned in the natural hiftorv of caterpillars,
to consider, whether it is not advisable to concert
some new measures for cementing and haÂ»moniz
ing the views and interests of this " povvei ful con
federacy.'*
Nothing, fays a correspondent, can better fliew
the spirit by which a certain faction is adluated,
than the gross and barefaced expedients they prac
tice to impose on the fuopofed ignorance and cre
dulity of their fellow-citizens. Ot this a notable
specimen is to be found in the animadversions on
the late loan from the Bank of the United States to
the government, contained in the National Gazette
of the 21ft inft. Among other sophistical absur
dities, it is a(Torted that " the loan will consist of
paper, which cojls the bank nothing," and that it
will be " repaid in gold and filverThis is a
direst and palpable untruth. The loan in question,
and every lo*n which is made by the bank, cither
:o the public or individuals, is absolutely and une
quivocally a loan in specie. The moment alter the
lum lent is palled to the credit of the borrower, he
or any person to whom he gives an order, for the
vv'iole, or any part, of it, can go or ftnd to the bank
and take out the amount \n guineas* dollars, or other
gold ox Jilvcr. âAnd this, in ladt, is dons in every
cafe in which gold and silver are more convenient
to the party entitled to receive than bank notes.
If he takes bank notes, it can only be bscaufe he
prefers them. And what arc these notes? They
ire payable to the bearer on demand, in gold or
silver. Every holder of a note can go or lend to
the bank any day in the week, except Sunday, and
receive the amount of it in specie. These arc taÂ£ls
known to every citizen of Philadelphia, to every
well-informed man in the United States.
When, therefore, the whole sum lent can, in the
firfl injlance, be taken out of the bank iu gold or sil
ver, or both, the mere pleafuie of the borrower â
when, if he takes note*, it mult be ior no other
reason than becaufc he prefers them-âand when,
for ihe notes which he takes, he or any other per
foil into whose hands they come, can at any time
demand and receive at the bank their amount in
*Â»old and silverâwith what propiiety, with what
plausibility, with what fcmblance of truth or mo
de sty, can the people be told that the loan inquel
tion consists of paper which cojls nothing to the bank ?
But this is not all. It is endeavored by ambi
guous and artful exprclfions, 10 induce a belirt
that the government has wantonly, without conjidcra
tion, and at the expence oj the people, granted Jour
millions of dollais to the bank. This is the natu
ral inference which uninformed readers would
draw from what is said : and yet nothing is fur
ther from the truth. The government has not
granted a Jmgle farthing. It has only granted to a
number of individuals a corporate capacity to en
able them to aifociate and unite their own money and
funds to carry on the bufincfs of banking. It is
irue,thcy make a profit by that business; but they
make i t only at the expence of those who voluntarily
deal with them, not at the expence of the people, as :s
lalfely and wickedly aliened. i hey make it at
the expence of those who arc wilting to borrow their
money; for the loan of which too iliey can take no
more than fix per cent, per annum. The borrower
also finds hhs compcnfation in the use of the money
which is lent to him ; so that in ftriflntls the pro-:
fits of the bank are at nobody's expence; lince
every one who contributes to them gets a full
equivalent for what he contributes. Nay, he
commonly makes a profit to himfelf, over and
above what he poys.
Neither has this mere privilege, this capacity to
associate and ast as a body, been granted without
abundant confederation. Several important pub
lic advantages .ifford of themfeives fufficient com
penlation. The accommodations to trade by fa
cilitating loans to those who carry it oil âand by
eftablifiling, in the notes of the bank, a more con
venient medium of lemittance from place to place.
The promoting of the easy collection of the reve
nue by means of those loans, and of an cncreafed
circulation. The rendering it moie eafytothe
government to obtain loans on moderate terms in
cases of emergency ; as in the very instance which
has called forth the malevolent ftri&ures under ex
amination.âNor arc these the only considerations
of the grantâA special and direst equivalent has
been secured by the government, in the very terms
of it, worth at this moment 1,200,000 dollars.
This results from the light reserved to the go
vernment to ftjbfcribe 2,000,000 of dollars to the
stock of the bank ; borrowing back with one hand
what is fubferihed with the oiher,& without an im
mediate advance of a single (hilling. By this ope
ration, at the present price of bank stock, the go
vernment has made a clear nett profit ot the furr.
above mentioned, namely, I,2oo,ooodollars, since
it can dispose of its (hare of that stock at an ad
vance of fixt) per cent.
The government then has in fatt secured to it
! felf one fifth of all the profits which the bank has
made, or (hall hereafter make. It has secured to
itfelf what is now equal to a clear gain of 1,200,000
dollars.âAre 1,200,000 dollars no consideration ?
Let the condutt of the national government be I
compared with that of the states, which have made
fimilnr grants. Pennsylvania, Maflachufetts, New-
York, Maryland. Which ol these Hates has made
so advantageous a bargain for itfelf as Congress
have done for the Union ?âNeither of them.â
Then where is the ground to fay that, in making
ihe grant, Congrcfs acted zcanton/v and without
consideration ? Pcace, Brawlers 1 Peace '

Under the former Poll-Office Law, the ex
change of newspapers between printers was a
matter of courtcfy and indulgence ; and lb uncer
tain was the communication which arose from
this indulgence, that those exchange papers
were intercepted and prevented from reaching
their destination more than half the timeâWitii
refpeft to papers for subscribers, the business
was still more precariousâDuring three years
experience, a series of facts have occured, so
adverse to a distant circulation of a newspaper,
that the Editor of this Gazetta is fully convinc
ed that the bufmefs wt Â«-'d very soon have en
tirely ceased, had not government interposed.â
For eighteen months preceding the tirfc ofjune,
not more than two thirds of the numbers of the
Gazette were received by distant subscribers,
through the medium of the poft-officeâThe
consequence was, that a very considerable pro
portion of them were discouraged from conti
nuing their subscriptionsâand in a very lhort
time, the idea of taking papers printed at the
feat of government, would have been very ge
nerally abandonedâComplaints became univer
fai; to remedy which, the new law was palledâ
an expence was inevitableâthe firft enquiry
was, whether this expence fhouldbe thrown up
on the community at large, or whether it
ihould be borne by those immediately benefited
âfor the income from the poft-ortice was not
calculated to be more than fufficient for the
support of the departmentâlt being determin
ed that it would be unjust to impose the burthen
on the whole communinyâthe next enquiry
was how the buftnefs should be equalized ? It is
known that the printing business is carried on
in tie northern states at a much cheaper rate
than in the fouthern.âHadprovifion been made
to transmit papers by the mail free of expence,
it is evident that the southern printers would
have been placed in a very disadvantageous li
tuationâfor the northern printers would have
poured their publications into the southern
states, at a price greatly below what the fame
work can poflibly be executed there.
Another confidsration wasâthe state of the
buiinefs as it refpedted a great number of pri
vate news-carriers, who traverse various parts
of the United States out of the post-roadsâ
some reference to the rates paid by those who
employed these riders, was neceflaryâon the
plan of having the expence general, these would
have been fubje&ed to a double iinpofition,
merely on account of not living on the polt
road.
Great pains was taken to ascertain the low
est rate of postage, which would be competent
to defraying the expenceâand it may be rea
sonably expected, that if on experiment thepre
fent rates are more than fufficient toenfure the
objeÂ«st, a punctual tranfmilfion of the papers,
that they will be reducedâno idea of a revenue
from newfpapsrs being contemplated.
The rates at present are not more than one
quarter of the sum paid to many private pollsâ
Should the law conduce to punctuality, of which
there can be no doubt, the papers will be dou
bly valuable, and from present appearances,
the circulation of newspapers will very soon he
greatly increafedâthis 9 whatever may be sug
gested to the contrary, was the design of Con
gress in pafling the lawâFor as ignorance is the
support of Tyranny, so misrepresentation and
fallhood are the bane ofLiberty and good go-
I vernment, the effe&s of which can only be coun
j tcra&ed by enabling the people to fee and judge
for themselves.
