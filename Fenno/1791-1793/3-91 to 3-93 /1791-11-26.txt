Copy of a letter from the King of France to the
National dffembly, accepting the Constitution
Gf.ntlemen,
I HAVE examined with attention the Conflitution which vou
preferÂ»ted me for acceptance. I accept it, and shall fee it exe
cuted This declaration would have been fumcicnt at another
time ; but at prefcnt I owe the interests of the nation and myfelf
an explanation of the motives that have induced this acceptance. â
from the beginning of my reign I have been desirous of reform
ing abuses, and in every ast of" government, have wished to be
guided b> public opinion. Various caufcs, among which the
fuuation of the finances when I came to the throne should be men
tioned, as also the immense expences unavoidably incurred for
the support of an honourable war, carried on tor a length of time,
without an increase of taxes, had a great difproponion
between the revenues and the expences ot the state.
Fully fcnfible of the enormity of the evil, I not only looked for
a remedy, but felt the neccflity of preventing its return. I con
ceived the design of establishing public felicity upon a firm foun
dation ; and tofubjeÂ£t to invariable rules even the authority which
I exerciled. I called around me the nation to execute this design.
In the course of events brought on by the revolution âmy intenti
ons have never varied. When, alter having reformed the ancient
institutions, you began to substitute for them your firft works, 1
did not wait to give them tv.y aifent that the whole Constitution
should be known to me. I favored the establishment of parts be
fore I could judge of the whole ; and though disturbances which
have attended almost every ftcp of the revolution too often were
the causes of great grief to me, I always hoped that the law would
resume its vigor in the hands of its new depositaries, and that as
you drew towards a conclusion of your labours, every day would
reltore it that refpeÂ£t, without which the people can neither be
free nor happy. I long perfilted in this hope ; my determination
Changed, when that hope left me.
Let every one call to recollection the time when I left Paris.
The Conflitution was nearly completed, and the authority of the
laws was diminiftiing. Public opinions, far from being fixed,
appeared to be more divided than ever. The least moderate opi
nions appeared alone to have weight. The licentiousness of the
press was at its height, and no authority was refpeÂ£ted. I could
not obtain an acquaintance with the general will, when by looking
around I could fee nothing but the laws without weight and not
enforced : Then, I mud fay it, had vou presented the Constituti
on at that time to me, I should not have thought it the interest of
the people, the constant and only rule of my conduct, that I should
have accepted it.
I enteitaineo but one sentiment : I had in view but one design :
J wilhed to retire out of the reach of every party, and examine
what was really the wish of the nation. The motives that influ
enced my conduct, no longer cxift ; since the inconveniences and
evils which I then complained of have struck you as they did me.
You have shewn a desire to restore good order ; you have at
tended to the undisciplined state of the army ; you have seen the
necessity of putting a (top to the licentiousness of the press. In
the rcvifion of your work, you have placed among the laws several
articles which have been presented me as conllitntional decrees.
You have established a lepal mode of reviling the Conflitution.
At length the public wish is known to me ; I have f en it evi
denced in the attachment of the people to your work, and to a
monarchical form of government.
I therefore accept the Conftitucion, I promise to support it in
the kingdom, ro defend it a gain ft foreign violence, and to procure
its execution by all the means which it places within my power.
I declare, that convinced of the attachment of the great majority
of the people to the Couftitution, I gave up the right of concur
rence, which I had called for in this work, and that being respon
sible to the nation alone, no one has a lo complain ol this de
parture from my original requifuion.
I should how ever deviate from truth, if I said that I have per
ceived in the administrative and executive authority all the energy
lieceirary to put in motion, and preserve harmony in all the parts
of this wide extended empire : But since opinions areat this time
divided on this fubjeft, I consent that experience alone should be
Ihe judge. When 1 shall have put into action all the powers plac
ed in my hands, I can fuller no reproach, and the nation, whose
intcieft tiiould bed comlaui rule, will explain itfclfiu the manner
WILLIAM PATERSON.
laid down in the Constitution. But to strengthen liberty and the
Constitution, to promote the individual happiness of every French,
man, certain interests pofttively cail for the re-union of all our ef
forts. These interests are, refpedt for the laws, the le-eftabhlh
ment of good order, and the re-union of citizens.
At this time the Constitution being finally eftabliflied, French
men living under the fame laws should know no other enemies
than those who disregard themâDiscord and anarchyâthey are
our common enemies : I will oppose them with all my might.
It is impoitant that vou and your fucccftors should second my ef
forts with energy. Without attempting to controul thought, the
law prote&s equally all those whose a6hons are in conformity to
it. Let those whom fear of perfections and disturbances have
driven from their country, find, when they return, security and
tranquility: And to put an end to feuds, to foften the diftrefTes
which a great revolution always occasions, and, that the law ma)
from tins time command with full energy and be well executed,
let us consent to forget the past. Let accusations and prosecuti
ons, which took their rife in events which accompanied the revo
lution, die away, and let an universal reconciliation take place.
I make no mention of those who have been guided only by their
attachment for me : Is it pollibie that you fticuld deem them
guilty ?âWith regard to those who, having been guilty of cxcefles
that involved nerfonal injuries, have drawn upon their heads the
vengeance of the laws, I prove to them, that lam King of all
Frenchmen.
P. S. I have thought, gentlemen, that I ought to pronounce my
solemn acceptance of the Constitution in the midst of the Repre
sentatives of the Nation, and on the Ipot where the Constitution
was framed ; I (hall therefore come to the National Assembly to
morrow at noon.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, SEPT. 13.
dfler the King hadfubfcribed the oath, the President made the following
jut'W/r o
INVETERATE abuses, which had long triumphed over the
good intentions of our best Kings, and which would still have con
tinued to defy the authority of the throne, kept France under op
preflion.
The National Aflembly, entrusted with the wishes, the rights
and power of the Deople, has, by the deftruffion of all abuses, rÂ£-
established the solid foundation of public prosperity.
Sire, what the National Aflembly has decreed, is ratified by the
consent of the people : the molt complete execution in all the parts
of the empire attests the general assent. It defeats the weak,
schemes of those whom discontent has too long rendered blind to
their own interests. It protnifes to your Majesty, that you will no
longer wifli in vain for the happiness of the French.
The National Aflembly has nothing more to wish for on this
ever-memorable day, wherein you consummate, in the midst of
them, the most solemn engagement âthe acceptation of the consti
tutional royalty. It is the attachment of the trenchâit is their
confidence which confer upon you this pure and refpe&ful title to
the faireft crown in the universe * and that which secures it to you,
is, Sire, the inexhaustible authority of a Constitution freely de
creed : it is the invincible strength of a people, who has felt itfelf
worthy of liberty : it is the want of hereditary monarchy, which
will always be indifpenfible to luch a great nation.
When your Majesty, expefling from experience the light which
it will throw upon the praÂ£hcal results of the Constitution, pro
mi fes to maintain it within and to defend it agfiivjl enemies from with
out, the nation, relying on the justice of their rights, and on the
consciousness of their strength and courage, as well as on the car
ncftnefsof your co-operation, cannot fee any ground of alarm I rom
without, and will concur by its quiet confidence in the quick suc
cess of its internal government.
How great to our eyes, dear to our hearts, and how sublime
will appear in our history the cera of this regeneration, which gives
citizens to Franceâa country to the French ;to you as a king, a
title to greatness and glory, and to you, as a man, a new source of
enjoyment and new fandlions ot happiness!
The fill owing Address from the General Assembly of
St. Domingo, was read in the House of Represen
tatives 0/ the United States, on Monday lafl.
TO THE HONORABLE IMS CONGRESS OF THE
UNITED STATES.
Gentlemen,
IN our letter of the 24 th of last August, you
received information of the misfortunes, which
had befallen the northern part of this flourjfhing
colony. Our whole force, though very limited,
has been levelled against the ravagers, who are
it waste ; and we have so far accomplish
ed our ends, as, if not to effect their total reduc
tion, at least to check the evil in its progress.
That unhappy cataflropbe forced the General
Assembly of the French part of Saint Domingo to
embrace every means of fafety, indispensable in
similar cases, and rendered necessary by the ur
gency of circumstances ; in consequence of which,
the flipping in general, and, among the reft,
the velfels belonging to your nation, have ex
perienced some little delay in their departure.
But, desirous of maintaining the union and har
mony, that subsist between France (of which we
conttitute a part) and your Statesâdesirous also
of telHfying, as far as in their power, their
arateful acknowledgment of the generous servi
ces offered and rendered to the colony, by the
brave fubjecfts of the United Statesâthe General
Assembly, in concert with the King's representa
tive have in the firft plate, set aside the Droit
d'Aubaine, in favor of such as might fall vie
tims to their own zeal and courage. The Aflem
bly would have wifbed to abolish it forever, and

point, they intend to apply for it to the mother
country ; and we have not a doubt, that flie will
eagerly gratify our wiflies.
In the next place, having taken into consider*
ation the obstacles, experienced by Mr. Sylvanus
BoHrne your consul in this colony, to the regii
try of his credentialsâobstacles, which were oc
casioned by certain formal defedisâthe General
Aflembly haltened to remove them, and to give
orders that the said credentials ihould be regis
tered.
Finally, under the constant influence of those
principles of jultice and equity, which cement
the union between the two allied nations, and
desirous of corresponding with the views of
France, who will ever hold clear that memora
ble epoch, when {he saw permanent security given
to the unlimited freedom of a nation, that has
furniihed her with the glorious example, for the
recovery of her own rights so long misunderstood
â the General Aflembly have,in favor of the Ame
ricans, liaflened to take off the embargo, which
the unfortunate fituarion of affairs had obliged
them to lay on all vessels without diftin<ftion.
But 111 vain would the colony have recovered
her former tranquility, if the means of applying
a speedy remedy to the evil were not to be em
ployed. The General AiTembly have therefore
determined to fend to your body two new coni
milfioners, Meflrs. De Beauvois and Payan, who
ate provided with letters from the Aflenibly and
.the King's representative.
The General Afleiubly do not entertain a doubt,
that you will together with a favorable recep
tion to them, give your allent to the requisitions
which they are empowered,ro make of you, the
fucce<*s of which will undoubtedly extend its influ
ence to the commerce, which the fubje<fis of the
United States carry orr with this colony.
With this pleasing hope, we contemplate their
departure, and diretft them to the representa
tives of a generous nation, the friend and ally of
France since the year i 782, the period when
fully recovered her liberty.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY November iy, 1791.
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
Debate on the Ratio of Representation,
(continued.)
MR. STEELE laid he should not have trou
bled the committee again if his observa
tions had not been dill or ted by the remarks
which had been made 011 them ; he hoped that
what he should offer on some of the opinions
which had fallen from gentlemen in opposition
to him would be received with that candoc.wiih
which he should deliver them. He profe&d to
be as warm a friend to the liberties of the peo
ple as any man, but he differed in his ideas ref
pe&ing the nieafures which would moil effectu
ally fecurethem; the prefentqueftion he thought
was not particularly interelting to the liberties
of the people, as the point of difference would,
not make a very great variation in that number
of the representative body which appeared to ba
the most eligible to the majority of the committee;
but tlie principle contended for, he conceived
had a very important afpetft on the (lability of
the government ; the fubje<st therefore should
be considered principally with refpedt to legisla
tion ; the great and efTential principles of which
he observed were involved in the difrulfionâand
here he thought that our own experience was the
bctl inttrutftor, for the examples quoted from
Great-Britain did not in his opinion apply to this
country in all refpeifts > the circumitances of the
people of the refpedive countries are efTentially
different.The States experiencing the dilÃcnlties srifing
from numerous icprefcncative aflemblies have in
several inflances diininilhed them ; ihe eiuilefs
divisibility of power conlequen: on fiich numbers
had fully I'atisried the people that tile want of ref
ponliuility was the pernicious effect of a large
representation ; they ai e therefore reducing tin;fa
unwieldy bodies r.s fait as the) can.âPcnnlyl
â Â»anra lie said, appeared to be far happier li;!ce
the redu&ion of its alleinbly.
A large fpheje of representation gave the peo
ple a fairer opportunity io felec't ilie belt cha
-1 a (ft .s ; i hey could exercise their own judgments
unbiased and uninfluenced ; the trull was great
er, which was conferred, and in proportion to
its magnitude would be the public lolicitude that
it fiould not be improperly delegatedâ beside.;
which, it is, said he, in.poliible in a large fpliere
of I epfclentation for candidates io piac'tice those
little arts, lo common at electionsânor can they
go round and take every little demagogue of the
cljftrii't \.y theljanJ to i'eenre his vote.
r_.ui opean examples had been recurred to,
he would mention one circomilance which con
firmed the jullice of hi? renrarks, those parts of
> ii cat-fii itain which are divided into the Urgeft
dittricrs, fend the Jin all elt number of represen
tatives, (ucli as London and the county of York
lhire, the latter tho containing more inhabitants
than the ancient dominion, fends .only two mem
bers to parliamentâand the members of those
dilhitfts, it is remarkable, have always been the
ftaunchelt friends of the liberties of the people.
In noticing the remarks of Mr. Giles and Mr.
findley lie said, that the objert of reprefentarion
was different from that oi giving information to
their conftittients; legislation was their great
bunnefsâand not making up weekly iarge pack
ets to fend oft to the influential characters in the
dillricts which the members represented on tlie
floor oi that house. The people it is true have a
right to be informed of public measures, and it
is the indispensable duty of government to make
provihon for that purpose ; and this ought to be
done through the medium of the Poll-Office
this medium is the only competent one, as it
will open the way for that general information!
which is neceflary to the security, and to the li-
of the people.
With refpe<!t to security from corruption by
means of a numerous representation, he still re
tained iÂ»is former opinion ;he did not antici
pate evils from that quarter.
He observed that in thp warmth of debate he
had before exprelfcd himfelf with rather more
zeal, than he wished he had ; but as lie thought
an undue degree of censure had been the con
sequence, it was become neceflary in foine mea
sure to julfify himfelf, by citing some examples
to (new what exceli'es a very numerous reprelen
tanve body may be guilty of. He then related
a fa eft which occurred in Virginia, the Legisla
ture of which on a certain time had acted In a
legislative executive and judicial capacity on
the fame occasion âhe also inllanced a more re
cent i act in tlie fecellion from their duty, of a
conliderable body of the reprefenratives of I'enn
fylvaniaâthefe fatfts demonilrated that a nume
rous representative body was liable to a mob
bifli Spirit.
He next adverted particularly to some remarks
of Mr. Giles, and concluded by flying rliat if
the ratio is ac this time fixed at 30,000, it mud
hereafter be encreafed, in doing which, foiue se
rious difficulties may take place, Specially in re
fpec't to tliofe Hates whole number of repiefenta
tives piuft in that cafe be reducedâhe thought
'fe bett therefore to agree at die piefeut
aTarger ratio.
Mr. Clark said he did not rife to trouble the
House with a lengthy difconrfe, for he had al
ways believed that long speeches answer no va
luabte purpose ; he meant only to offer a few re

and likewise of h.onefry and difboriefly : and with
respect to the fmalluefs of the diilrict, or that it
was fafer.for a small number to fend a member
than a greater, he was of a different opinion, as
he believed, that if ever the practtice of bribery
should come into play in America, it would be
easier for a reprefbntative to purchase a finall
diflriCt than a large one : if ever the liberties
of the people are endangered, it will not be by
ihe finallnefj of the rep: cfeniation but by the
corruption of electors and elections : This is the
door which Congrcf; flioul.! guard in tlie drifted
manner, and that will secure the people againfl
corruption in the House.

Congrcfs which was compoled of a much smaller
number, were entrufled with thedifpofal oflarger
fuins, although there were sometimes only two
members from the largest State, Virginia, and
no complaints were heard of their conduit.
But there is an argument which ought to have
weight in the present queflion.âThe Senate,
although a much smaller body than this House,
are fully competent to judge of our proceedings
and of the fafety of the country : indeed, ("aid
Mr. Clark, it appears very evident to me that
we are not in want of a larger number in the
House of Representatives to debate any queflion,
if it be considered how much lias already been
said on the (abject now before us.
Mr. Vining exprefled much surprise that the
subject, which to him appeared perfectly defina
ble, fliould have occasioned the debate to travel
so widely from the line marked out by tiie Con
stitution. The pendulum Teems to vibrate be
tween tlie numbers 81, 96, and tig ; and flioold
that pendulum relt 011 any one of them in pre
ference to the others, he could not suppose that
u would affecft the liberties of America. Why,
therefore, all this extraneous argument about a
point offo easy decision ? We are sent here to
adininifter the government ; the firll principles
of which arc already fixed, so that neither branch
crm encroach on the other. The Senate, the
House of lieprefentatives, the President, have
each defined powers ; and whillt thole remain.
1 (hall always believe the liberties of America
are invulnerable.
Underthis impression, Mr. Chairman, I shall
vote for Itriking out 30,000, in order to accom
modate the queltion to a medium. But 1 fliall
do this 011 different principles from some other
gentlemen ; notwithllanding I at the fame time
confefs that the ratification of the firlt amend
ment to the Conftitutiou ought to govern us in
deciding this queltion. Thefpirit of the amend
ment appears <0 me clearly to imply, that we
should not fnffer the number of Representatives
to exceed one for 30,000. I am here not as a
person who shall exercil'e discretionary opinions,
but judge by the lister of the Conflituiion : and
in this cafe we may increase the number, but we
cannot make it lef's after the enumeration. In
the mean lime, until that enumeration is com
plete, the representation remains as it has been
hitherto, which I believe may be about one mem
ber to every 40 or 41 thousand.
If" we go upon theory only, I would enlarge
the representation to its greatest: extent, and hand
down the principle toj'uiuiiiy ir, letters of gold,
that a very great repKfentatioiiâthat democra
cy is the very best government that can potfibly
be deviled, provided it were practicable to give
it (lability. Next to a government as free as the
ory could extend, we have the freeft iti the world ;
a government of representation, which will in'-
crease with rbe population! of the country, and
the ten new States will always preserve an'equi
librium ; but if you increase it to an extreme
you may render it tumultuous, although it may
be fafe. 3

with tlie gentleman from Pennsylvania, tifat a
ti ding expence is no object compared to 'the"fe
cunty of the peo.de ; but ! am lorry to hear any
thing of locality or the passions of the people in
troduced, for tjie voice of the people ; for if lo
cality and paflion were to govern this Houle, in
stead of vix populi we should soon have occasion
to term it by another name, the vox diaboli.
1 am under 110 apprehensions from the flock
holders of the bank, or the (peculators in the
funds ; for it is their interest to have a wife and
giiod representation. The people who are ein
[ ployed in the more simple path of agriculture,
lernoved at a great distance, are 110: more inter
eiicti in the security of the government than the
more informed stockholder. As an example of
ihe difcerninent ol 1 lie great commercial people
of London and Briflol, I need only mention their
choice of a Fox and a Burke, for until a late day
tVjr. Burke was the champion of the people and
the friend of liberty.
If our Senate should take any unwarrantable
it ride towards arillocracy, have we not the po*-
er to check them ? No President can very well
attempt it at any time hereafter; and we are
perfectly secure in the prcfent time from all sus
picion of corruption.
1 Â»ie fcate winch 1 represent contains 59,00Â®

the line of my duty by voting for a ratio of 34,000,

nie ir. A due proportion of firmnefs 1 think lie
ce'diiry in the government, and we shall weaken
it by any change which is not for the better.
1 fiirink from nothing, fir, but a breach of my
duty, rfnd it is not the public voice, so much as
the public good, that ought to be considered.
In reply to the analogy introduced by the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania, of a road, 1 will beg
leave to mention another. Suppose a pillar was
to be railed which could be easily effected by roo
men, and that two or thiee hundred were em
ployed, would not this, in the language of the
veneiable Franklin, be paying dear forthewhif
tle ? But this is a subjeCt which I should be fir
ry to view with a ludicrous face ; it is a queflion
of liberty, wherein the state governments have
an equal fliare of security : and let the pendulum
of the ratio light cither below or above 97, or
it 1, there is equal fafety ; and all that has been
'aid goes to prove that as the population increas
es, we ought ro fncreafe the representation â 
that ratio, and at present I think the nui-iber
34,000 will meet the sense of America.WEDNESDAY, November 23

The report of the committee on the petition of
James Jackson was taken into consideration by
the committee of the whole house.
Mr. Muhlenberg in the chair.
The report being read by the Clerk,
Mr. Wayue rose and obfefved, that about eleven
months were now elapsed (irrfce the election, which
is at pre Pent called in question, liad taken placeâ
i iat the hotife \v;.s already upwards of four weeks
111 ieliionâthat tlie petitioner mult finely have
had time fufiicient 10 come forward, at the (hit
"leering of the house, to support the charwes con
tamed in his petitionâthat it could hardly be
imagined tlie want ot time prevented him from
advancingâNo !âit was rather to be supposed,
that he was kept back by the want of evidence,
to fubdantiate thole charges; and perhaps by the
expectation of procuring a majority intheLegif
latuie ot Georgia, to countenance his claims":
tliele wcie taths, which, he believed, were not
unknown to feme gentlemen in the houle : the
fame arts, the fame practices, the fame manoeu
vres, which had procured a presentment from the
grand jury, against the election in question, and
even againlt fume of ihe aiits of the general go
vernment, might perhaps be expetiteci to prevail
at length with the legislative body.
The newfpapeis (he observed) have teemed
011 this occalion, with telliinonies and affidavits'
procured during several months pall; as to the
manner in which they had been obtained that
he said, was a fubjeift of inveftigatfon forafuture
dayâlonie of them were under the signatures of
persons who had never read, nor were capable of
reading tiiemâhe felt for tlie iituation of feme
of thole individuals, as they w ere already pi e
fented for perjury oil that occalion.
lie declared that he entertained not the tnoft
<liii.auc delire to proci altinate an enquiry into the
merits of the election â but he mult observe, that
it could not but be obvious to every gentleman on
che-floor,that no other country in the world would
countenance tiie mode in which Mr. Jackson had
proceeded, by the publication of ex-purle evidence
on a fubjetft that was to come under the invelli
gation of the house.
He concluocd by declaringliis un willingness to
treipafs on tbe time of the committeeâhe would
therefore only beg leave to recapitulate, that ele
ven months were elapf'ed since the election took
place; and that the petioner had, ever since, been
indultrioufiy employed in procuring evidence : â
if the committee should be disposed to indulge
the gentleman with further time for that pur
pose, he would not, for his part, make the smallest
objection to granting him that indulgence:
should they think proper to adopt the report now
under conlideration, which seemed to contem
plate and even to invite the advances of that gen
tleman, he would have no objecton to meet hi in
upon that ground, or upon any other, provided
it were honorable ground.
The committee then proceeded to confiderthe
resolutions Unfiling a time for the trial, and re
gulating the mode in which it is to be conducted ;
and after having made sundry amendments there
to, vofe; reported progiefs, and alked leave to fit
again. Adjourned.

SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
Some time since the public was informed that the law of Droit
d'Aubaint was in force in the French Islands ; fhortlv after, an ex
tratt was published from the proceedings of the National Afftm
bly, purporting a total repeal of that law. A late letter from
Tape-Francois informs, that on a petition ftom the American
Merchants, "the odious Droit d*Aubaine was unanimously abo
liflied"âbut the letter from the Genera! Assembly to Congrt 1%
latelv read in the House of Representatives, fays that the Droit
d'Aubaine is (only) set afidc in favor of such (Americans) as migh:
fall vi&ims to their zeal and courage fin fighting the blacksjâ
the exemption is not extended to Americans in general.
The bencficial effe&sof the funding system have been so gene
rally acknowledged, that every measure. which can compleat it
must be agreeable to the citizens of the United States. It muib
however continue defe&ive, as long as there remain unfunded
debts, whether they be continental or state debts. Indeed, since*
Congress have aflumed the state debts, they have become conti
nental; and anv provision which made for the unfubferib
cd part of one species of debt, must of course be extended to the
other. If anv preference be given, it Hioulcl rather be to those
who were willing to fubferibe, but from the limitation of the as
sumption have been unable, than to those who were able to fub
feribe, but fiom an avaricious spirit have been unwilling. More
favor should be shewn to those who had confidence in the govern
ment, and accepted the terms offered, than to those who either
wanted confidence, or have spurned at those terms. In every
point of view, justice, policy and consistency, diflate a compleat
aflumption of, and provision for those debts which were avowedly
contracted for the general defence and common welfare.
When people complain of the burden of the Excise, it is natural
to underftarid that they mean its tendency to impoverifli the com
munity, by draining the wealth of individuals into the public cof
fers. Without beating our brains out against the pofL of (pecula
tion. let a plain man, who knows how he earns his moneyj and.
how other folks spend theirs, ask this plain questionâHow much
richer would he become in cafe the excise was suspended for se
ven years? If his sons and his laborers ftiould drink fix juleps each
of a morning, tax free, would it put more grain into his corn
ftack ? So long as taxes are confined to articles which it is no
discredit for people to deny themselves, who can complain of op
preflion ?
AMENDMENT.
A correspondent would enquire, whether in pursuance of the
prevailing idea, that the general interest will be promoted by a
more full representation of the people in Cor.grefs, it would not
be an improvement on the proposed plan of representation, if the?
people through the Union were divided into diftritts of thirty
thousand each, without any regard to statesâbeginning eithrr at
New-Hampshire or Georgia ? Two obvious advantages would re
sult from this mode; there would be few, or no fra&ionsâand
local or state attachments would be loft,in the general idea of Con
tinental Representation.
If a 11 friend and Cujlomer" will call on the Editor, he will
convince him that he labors under a miflake.

PHILADELPHIA.
A CORRESPONDENT OBSERVES,
IT is certainly among the firft duties ofa legis
lative body to provide as far as poflible the
means for difFufing among all the citizens of a
free country, information refpedting their rights
and privilegesâaknowlcdgeofthe laws by which
rbey are governed, and ti;e reasons on which
those laws are soundedâalso foch political, mo
ral and social intelligence as has special refer
ence to their freedom, peace, security and hap
piness. linprefled with this idea, the legislature
of the United States has provided, by law, for
the publication of their acts and resolutions, on
a liberal and extensive scale, not only in volumes,
for the life of the several Hate legiflat tires, but
nlfo in several of the newspapers of the refpetftive
states. This provision, so far as it goes, is salu
tary ; but it is obvious that it is also tieceflary to
the exigence and administration of the govern
ment. It therefore now remains, to complete a
patriotic system of general information, that ade
quate provision be made to diffufe, with punctu
ality and certainty, that mass of intelligence
which our numerous periodical publications af
ford.
In the most enlightened countries of Europe,
this information is circulated through the me
4ium the port-officeâfor experience fully
fhews/rnat no private arrangements which can
be made will be found adequate to the purpose.
Since the glorious revolution in France has ta
ken place, that wife and sagacious people, by
their national aflembly, have opened the channels
of intelligence upon a plan so liberal and univer
sal as to have produced the most aftonifhina ef
fedls. In England, it has been aflerted that the
newspapers are circulated through the medium
of the pofl-office to all parts of the kingdom.
A% this country has exhibited examples to man
kind of a just and liberal policy on many impor
tant points, and which have been applauded and
adopted by folne of the oldest countries in Eu
rope, the examples above recited jullly demand
our imitationâbut, independent of this confede
ration, the merits of the business claim the fulleft
attention of our civil fathersâand when to this
is added the weight of the public opinion so de
cidedly in its favor, a doubt cannot exist of every
thing being done to meet the vviihes of the
people.
~ Two very liberal events have transpired in the
preceding yearâMr. Wilberforce, for his en
