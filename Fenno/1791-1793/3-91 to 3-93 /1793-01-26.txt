From the AMERICAN MERLVRV.
CERTA JNJiighly diftinguilhed oppofers of
the corrupt administration of oui national
governmtnc, hold preachers and preaching in
utier contempt; they arc too much of philoso
phers to be chrifliansâSedfasejl et ab hojle doccri
-âthat is to fay, they fee the great efficacy of
preaching to propagate and to preserve religious
opinions. Why then should they not turn the
guns of the enemy upon him ?âPreaching anti
fed era I ism may prove equally cogent for doc
trine, for reproof, for discipline, for ftirrincr U p
weak minds against Congress. and for confirm
ing the faith of those whom the prosperous ad
m niftration of the constitution has half per
suaded to be federal. Therefore, on matiire de
liberation, the Jacobins of this country, have re
solved in their Council, that it will be pioper to
deJiver a course of antifederal Lcthtres.
For this purpose, iiinerant preacht is will be
lent into all pans of the country. Persons will
be appointed to hold forth in bar-?ooim, at re
viewing of the militia, and in all places of pub
lic resort. Some shall be sent to Rh de-Island,
?rid oihers to Vermont. The Apostles who are
obliged to flay at home, may be ufeful bv wiit
ing Letters. By that means, and by the meet
ing of the agents of different difti iÂ£ls of country
at New-York, the attack on th** Vice-President
was carried on with peculiar skill and force
but it remains to impress the people with pioper
feniiments. If that could be fuccefsfullv done,
we might have the comfortable hope of feeing a
revolution in government once or twice a year.
We might talk as the Fiench do about the anlient
Constitution, (meaning 1 hat made last vear.) â
Like the Tartars we might keep-on the move
from one plea fa nt station in politics to another;
we should not get bigoted to old systems again,
as we are at prcfent ; ana to such a degree that
any scheme of amendment and improvement is
flifled at the birth. The are afraid of
flaying long in a place, for feai of getting wed
ded to it, and consequently losing their indepen
dency. Every re volution would open fre Hi paf
turc for the Cattle, and the National Gazette
fair iy tells us, it high time to set about it.
in order to aflift our Leftuiers, and to pre
pare the public for their leccption, we give a
Syllabus of the LeÂ£tÂ«rts.
Leelure iji. The amendments to the Constitu
tion were mere milk and water, not having al
tered its pcinciplesj nor afforded the flighted fc
curitv against their dangerous and despotic ten
dency.
2d. That the amendments have done away
the objedions of the Anrifedcralifts, so thai Gov.
Clinton is now a better Fcderalift than Mr. John
Adams. Meke the former Vice-President, and
he will become better than a good Fcderalift,
and will put the monarchy-men, and the sup
porters of ihc monied systems, 10 a total rout.
3d. Shews how the Constitution may be prov
ed co forbid any meafuie, good or badâthis se
cret is to be learned by examples. The Bank
Law was oroved to be point blank against ihe
ConstitutionâTread one loot off the letter of
that writing, and you get in o the mire. Pass a
law to carry any of the powers expressly given
to Congress into executionâif the law require
you.to provide the ntceffary means for giving it
effc$ R prove that you cannot constitutionally
adopt the means II you could, would
be as despotic as TippooSaib. Provided al
ways, that if the Bank Charter were limited to
ten years t or eftabiiftied on the Poiowmac, it
would be as ccrtllituiion.-tlas the rcfidcnce aÂ£t.
4th. The best method of recovering popula
rity, vote against all grants of nroneyâvote a
ramU every rne;jfure. If ii should pass and be
approved in the operation, nobody will ask
what part you took. If it should raise a cla
mour, you may fay I told yrÂ«u so.
sth. A question of casuistryâWhether a Con
crete man may lie tor hi* party ? In doubtful
calcs, the opinion and practice of the fathers are
tailed; the affirmative of this question is (dp
ported by precedent, arid good confidence dic
tates that a man (hould do all the good he can.
Jn this Ltfture the point is difcuffrd, whether if
Â£ man lie, and the thing pinches, he is bound to
swear to.it. It is ftiewn that it a clcver fellow
is hired for it, lie is bound 10 earn his wage*.
6th. On ihe proper discipline of a party âIww
to make tfcr men follow their file leader.
[Whole No. 591.]
7'h. On the phrTntophy of prejudice, or Vhe
art of addreffinfc the pa(W,s of the ,u,.plcâ

OFT. 9,5. The return of the votes for the e
leclion of a Mayor of is, was hist nig'tt ex.
amined, when it appeared, that of 14,317
votes, 13,746 were in favor of Petion. The
1 eft of the votes were between Mes

of Prufiia, had each of themâane vote.

ons.
Citizens,
I, .
I HAVE had the Ixinour, some time ago,
to inform you that, being called to a feat in
the National Convention, 1 had accepted of
that important million ; that I could, nor
ought not to hold two different offices; and
at the lame time I had rcqr.efted you to pro
ceed to tlie nomination of a new Mayor. Yovi
have a second time honored me with your (Vf
frages,âthere is nothing more glorious for
me, and I want words to express to y6u my
gratitude. I can but view that choice as a
mark of friendfhip, and of the recollection of
the services which I may have rendered to
this,city. I confefs it is very painful to me
not to be able to correspond to that confi.
dence, which X value lo much. When I ei
ter the House of AfTentbly as a Representa
tive of the Republic, I only ebey the patriotic
principles of serving well my country. Ac
cept my fincerefV regrets, and tie affurauce
of my entire devotion to your welfare.
Your Fellow-Citizen,
PETION.
O&ober 26, 179 a.
It is afiured that the fe&ion of Marseille
have come to a resolution, to invite the 83
departments to join them in their
fa rift ion to a decree of the wiiich
di reels the afiemblage of an armed forcc in
the capita!.
Army of the North.
To the showers of fire which have, daring
ten days, deluged us with ruins, succeeds the
roaring noise of a formidable army, which ij
encamped in the plain where Luckner was
posted at the time of his expedition into Weft
â¢ Flanders ; and to that infernal storm succeeds
at last, that peace of mind which the glory of
having deserved the approbation of one's
country, can alone inspire. The Auftmn
satellites and plunderers, who had evacuated
Iloubaix, have returned, there to exercise
anew their pillaging. They plundered yes
terday two waggons loaded with the fluffs
which are fabricated in that borough. We
have fkirniifhes everyday at Pont-rouge, in
which we have always the advantage.
November. 8.
They seem to reproach Gen. Dumourier,
and the other Generals, with not having done
the Pruflians, in their precipitate retreat, all
the harm and mifchief they could. It is an
easy matter to ast the part of a critic in the
closet, especially when we are neither ac
quainted with the places, the things nor the
motives which determined our Generals to
ast this or that part. To have reduced and
compelled, by ikilful manoeuvres, an enemy
fully able, to fall back, to have liar raffed thejn
continually, to have intercepted their provi
sions, and their convoys, to have every day
taken prisoners from themâis a result for
tunate enough to disarm envy, and filenci
those ariftocratical detrafters. We have ob
served it at the beginning of the war, that'
the best combined fvftem of defence, was not
to hazard bloody battles, but precifelv to do
what was done. Success has fully juftified
our expectation, and we are far from pre
tending to the presumptuous felflove of beirg
thought a warlike people.
After tl*e fur render of Nice, the Bishop of
that city dared to congratu'ate the French
General, who with firninefs answered fcim,
that he could 1105 believe his bypou itital ]an

which advice th? Bifbop very wifely followed.

BAL'fIMORE, January 21
from a correspondent.
Answer to an Evgljjh Paragraph exhibiting tie
aifterevct between the French and American Re
volution., lately puHiJked in fame of the Nev Pa
pers in the United States. Je
FHERP., is that difference between the
French and American Revolutions, that the
latter was not opposed by cunning priests, nor
cruel aristocrats determined to overthrow
every principle of honelty and humanity, for
a emmefa hilled by common senseâA royal
puppet, on this spot, did not dance on the wire
of a band of courtiers, the most despicable and
abandoned wretches that ever difgraccd man
kindâThe focus of both despotism and no!Â«i.
lity was far from this land of liberty, and its
glorious adherents.could not be infected with
the pernicious breath of mad royalty and im
pudent aristocracy. The popular cause was
opposed openlv, sword in hand, and viftori
oufly fought by tile friends to the rights of
men; had the French republicans met with
such opponents, they had not done those ex
ceiles the Kin<r, the Nobles and Clergy have
roused them to by the most perfidiouVtontrl
vancesâA King did no t foi swear hinifclf in
America, nor hacl the American people more
t.iai> one Arnold; their tempers were soured
neither by misery nor by a complicated fvftcm
of treachery, framed coolly, and purfuedwith
t.ie gieateft obstinacyâThe American people
were not loaded with enormous taxes, that
had reduced millions of their fellow citizens
to the utmost misery, to maintain haughty
pmnderers in sloth and profligacv All this
odds 111 u(I be reckoned by impartial men, to
explain the difference infidionfly delineated
between the two Revolutions, bv f.ime des
perate royalist, or a narrow-minded man.

The memorial 'f officers of fevfrttl lines of
the late army of the United Stales, being un
der corfJeralicn, in committee of the <wha:e,
a motion was made to rijefl the prayer
oj the meinurials.
Mr. SEDGWICK observed that he did not
rife to express an opinion as to any vote which
he might ultimately give on the subjeCt now be
fore the committee. It was undoubtedly an im
portant subjeCtâimportant, as it respects tÂ£e
character of the applicants, and a* it involved a
consideration of the services which had been
rendered by them. No man had a more re
fpeCtful opinion than he entertained of the hon
orable patriotism of those brave and meritori
ous citizen#, who had ventured their lives in de
fence of their country, No man would more
regret than himfelf, that those Cervices should
remain unremunerated. Thus feeling, he should
be sorry if the motion of the gentleman frotfi
New-Jersey should preclude a difcufiion of the
various questions which might otherwise arise
in the contemplation of this fubjeCt.
He laid he knew several gentlemen who be
lieved that it was impracticable to grant the
prayer of the memorials, without producing e
vils, so many and so great, as infinitely more
than to counterbalance the benefits ntended.
That it would be a criminating reflection on
gentlemen who, with so much warmth of de
clamation, had espoused the taufe of the appli
cants, to suppose that they forefaw those evils and
were not prepared to guard against them, ft
would be indirectly charging upon them as the
motive of their conduit, to give an approving
countenance to an impracticable objeCt, an in
tention ofacquiring popularity at the expence of
the reputation of the government. This was a
charge he had no disposition to make; he would
therefore suppose the gentlemen had digested
feme scheme, in their opinion of practicable
compensation; which, by what they have said,
they have pledged to bring forward to the con
sideration of the committee; but they would be
precluded from doing it, should the mover of
the present queflion perfilt in having the fate
of the memorials decided on his motion.
He laid that, confident in the hope that the
gentleman would gratify the wilhes of his friends,
he would take the liberty of mentioning some of
the embarrafling questions which the commit
tee must meet in the progress of this business.
The whole merit of the present application,
in his opinion, relied on the supposition tbatby
the terms of the funding law the government
had made a saving to itfelf; or, to speak with
more precision, to the debtor part of the com
munity. In other words, that by the terms of
the loan an adequate provision was not made for
the public debt. This supposition is denied by
many gentlemen, who did not hesitate expressly
to declaie, that the provision is ample and ought
to be fatisfa&ory. Others, lie faic, went further,
and even infinuatcd that there exilled a sympa
thetic feirfibility between the majority of Con
gress and the public creditors, injurious to the
great body of the people. This saving confli
cted that residuum of the original contrail*
which was the fubje<ft of the present demand.
If then there was no saving there was no residu
umâno fubjcA of diflribution. On this idea,
the application is to the generosity, not the jus
tice of Cosgrefs. On this ground the memori
als, he presumed, were not advocated by those
gentlemen. Should it, howevsr, be demonstrat
ed that the contemplated saving had been made
to the public, he aiked whether this waÂ« the
only description of creditors to whom injuflice
had been dbne ? and would not the fame argu
ments which should detr.onftrate their rights
prove equally the title of every otber original
holder to further provision ? Was there any dis
criminating principle by which it would appear
that these men alone were entitled to redrel's for
a violation of justice ? These queilions were
important, and being obvious, they must have
occurred to the gentlemen; who, it might rea
sonably be presumed, had come prepared, if not
with fatisfaaory, at lead with plausible answers.
He said, that among the evils which had been
. endured during our struggle for freedom and in
dependence, was a lapse of public credit, by
which there had been apportioned a severe tax
011 the citizens; and although this was not in
exaÂ£ proportion, yet it was generally more e
qual than probably any re-apportionment would
make it. It was said, at lead by some, that by
comparing the relative circumf.ar.ces of the ar
my before and since the war, with the commu
nity at large, it might be presumed that they
had not contributed to this tax beyond their pro
portion. If on the whole, the claim of the ar
my could not be diftinguiflied from that of the
other original creditors, and if justice required
the provision contended for, then it would fol
low irrefiftably, that an account was to be open,
ed with each original creditor; that even if a dif
tindion could be discovered which would au
thorise a difference between the army and every
other description of creditors, it was, he said,
further alked, by gentlemen who believed the
projefi tobe.impraaicable.whetherit was intend
ed, by a further diftinaion, to separate the offii
cers from the soldiers, to provide for the forflier
and not for tha latter ? If one part of the di
lemma was chosen it would eperate manifell in
justice, if the other the government would open
those sources of fpcculation which seemed to
threaten to inundate the country with enormous
evils. He said, gentlemen who were disposed
to afford a favorable countenance to tbe present
applications had undoubtedly considered these
effe&s, and had alio considered the means of pre
venting those evils, and candor required that
they Ihould be indulged with an opportunity of
exhibiting their system.
HÂ« said that it was further objeaed that the
proposed measure would materially alter the
274
funding fyftcm, a strait adherence to which
was guaranteed to the public by an almost una
nimous vote of both Houses.
He said the objc&ions he had mentioned were
among the most important of those which had
occurred on this fubjeil; that a difcuflion ot
them would open an cxtenfi/e field of argument.
He thought it would 1 e of public utility that
they {hould be difcKffed, he therefore again fo
licitcd the gentleman from Ncw-Jerfey to with
draw his motion, that an opportunity might be
afforded to gentlemen to bring forward a di
gefled fyltem.
Mr. Boudinot assured the committee, that he
had determined not to trouble them on this fub
je*fl< and he ihould have carried that determina
tion into execution, did he not find that the
question was likely to be taken in a manner not
altogether pleasing to him. He had expedted
that the claims of the officers would have been
fairly met, and if decided in tbe negative, those
gentlemen, would have gone away fully fatisfied
that their claims had received a fair and candid
difcuflion : But he feared, from the arguments
of gentlemen, that the idea that the United
States had unjustly. failed in performing the con
trail with the army, would take place, and an
ungrounded imputation ofpartaility (at least in
the minds of the petitioners) would be left on
the government, when Mr. B. thought, a fair
flatement of the matter would undoubtedly put
a very different face on the whole bufmefs. 'l he
officers ef the army had come forward as credi
tors of the United States in a decent arid becom
ing manner, and presented their claims founded
on former contracts, which they conceived had
not been fulfilled, and therefore they called on
government to do what was right and just on
the occalion. Congrels were the independent
representatives of the whole usion, to whom e
very citizen ought to have free access, and where
every citizen was to be considered as equally en
titled to an impartial hearing. If on examina
tion it (hould appear that justice required a far
ther eompenfation to the petitioners as a claf's of
public creditors, when considered on a general
scale, no man in the house would be more ready
than himfelf to give his voicÂ« for such a measure.
But if it should ap.pear that th<J contrail on the
part of riie 1 public had been complied with, as far
as distributive justice would permit, he wished
the petitioners to be convinced of it, and that
those losses they had met with, were such as had
been equally borne by other creditors of the uni
on, and therefore a general burthen, by which
he hoped they would receive full fatisfa&ion on
this fubjedl.
Mr. Boudinot, while he acknowledged the
patriotism and virtue of the American army,
and fubferibed fully to their eminent fervice3
and patient fufferings, he could not join in de
crying the efTential services and fuiferings of the
other public creditors of the United States, who
in the day of her distress had administered their
property, to the support of that army and the
defence of the union. All public creditors who
presented themselves in the day of distress to the
relief of the Union, were equally entitled to the
attention of Congress; but as the officers in their
memorials had applied in behalf of the army
alone, he wished to consider their in the
firil instance, abftra&ly, without conne&ing it
with any other class of creditors, and then com
pare it with others of their fellow-citizens.
He undertook, therefore, in the firft place,
to state the public condudt towards the army
from the beginning to the commencement of the
preient governmentâHe would then examine
the conduit of the preient government, and
lastly, fuppoGng their claim just, enquire into
the practicability of it.
The committee were well acquainted with the
rife and progress of the late war. At the fir 11
alarm the patriotic citizens of the colonies flaw
to their arms and formed in the field, without
terms or stipulations as to their services. In 1775
Congress turned their attention to the army as
the firfl great objeÂ«sl, and having organized it,
fixed the pay at the rate of 50 dollars for a colo
nel, and zo dollars for a captain. In 1776, de
sirous of encouraging citizens who were so zeal
ous in their country's service, they gave a boun
ty of 20 dollars to each private, amounting in
the whole to upwards of 100,000 dollars, be
sides a promifc of 100 acres of land, and to the
officers at the rate of 500 acres to a colonel, and
the reft in proportion. In October of the fame
year, desirous of keeping up the zeal of the of
ficers, they increased the pay in proportion of
75 dollars to a colonel, and 40 dollars to a cap
tain, and gave a suit of clothes per annum to
every private, or 20 dollars in calh. In Dec.
*777> Congress shewed their desire of encourag
ing the service, by giving a month's extra pay
to the army. The officers, anxious for their fu
ture support after the war was over, exprefTed
an earnelt desire of having foine provision of this
fort anticipated, and Congress in compliance
with their delires, after a consideration of three
months or more, agreed in May 1778, to give
each officer half pay for 7 years after the end
ol the war, on condition that they did not
hold any office of profit under any individual
state, and 80 dollars to each private. In Novem
ber following they gave to each supernumerary
officer one year's pay extraordinary, and increas
ed the allowance for every retained ration to
as. 6d. in money. The army, not being fatisfi
ed with this provision, in Augufc 1779 a com
mittee appointed for the purpose reported far
ther provision of half pay for life, without any
condition in favour of those who should continue
till the end of the war, and recommended to the
Hates to provide for widows of officers and sol
diers who should be killed in the service. Con
gress likewise increased the allowance of month
ly fubiiftence for officers to 500 dollars for a
colonel, a captain 200 dollars, and a private 10
dollars, and added to all this, Congress allowed
the officers to receive from the public stores one
nat, a watch coat, body coat, four vests, four
pair breeches, four shirts, four stocks, fix pair
{lockings, four pair flioes, per annum, nearly at
former prices, and the foldler. in proportion
The half pay for life was adopted, to the great
offence of individual states, who lent fnrwa .
petitions against the measure as impolitic and
unjust. The war continuing, the distresses of
the country iiicreafed, which reduced tin
credit so low, as to produce great uneafinels a
mong all classes of public creditors, both in the
army and country.
The gentleman from P< nnfylvania (Mr. Hart
ey) in his argument represented (in Mr.B'so .i"
"ion) his own feelings 011 tin <>ccafion,rÂ«hJ
than a comparative view with the fufferjn?s of
the citizens at large ; for it a not uncommon
when gentlemen are cunire&cd with a ji art i cil .'
Ur class of fuflerers, to view what he lees a , l( j
hears .sail exclufivc and peculiar evil, without
considering what paflen elfewhcre. Thus tie
loluicr confidcrs the facrifice of the army a, t|-~ c
only intolerable burthen, while the merc^an
knowing his own losses heft, considers other's'
complaints as trifling to his; and the Carm.-r
who earns every farthing by the sweat cf fiiÂ»
brow, blames the government for not eivii y
him the firft place in all tlieir fyftcms. Yet the
fair coriclufion is, that the burthen has been gen
erally nearly equal, and a common tax for th
defence of our countryâAnd although Mr '!
readily fubferibed to the great iu.Tcrkigs a'u<i
patriotic exertions of the army, yet the-/ihou!d
also give credit for the attention of their coun
try, to the utmoll of her abilities. As the gen
tleman irom Pennsylvania is be ft acquainted
with the line of his own llate, Mr. Boudinot
undertook to mention what was done by Pcnn
fylvania for her own officers in addition to the
allowances of Congreft.âDuringthe war,ftores
were provided, from which they received'a par
tial fuppiy at the hard money prices; The de
predation of their pay was fully made uo to
them ; at the falesof the confifcated estates thdr
certificates were received as hard money; the
fame for lands in the lanii-office ;-*-lhu iutÂ«vH
of 6 per cent, was paid 011 their cerciliâ  ares for
a number of years;âan additional bounty of
land was given to them, ready furveved and
free from expence; and when the fundiiigfyftem
took place, they had their 3 per cent, and de
ferred debt made good to 6 per cent, by addi
tional certificates from the Hate, which were
afterwards tedeemed at about jo and 37 per
cent, in hard money.
In August 1782, a memorial from the fiatc of
Pennsylvania called loudly on Congress for frelh
exertions towards the settlement of all accounts,
and making provision for the paying off the pub
lic debt. It is supposed the army took the hint,
and in December following, a deputation of field
officers with a llrong memorial on behalf of the
army, waited on Congress. The substance of
their requcft was, ift. some prefenf payâ2d.
a settlement of their accounts and fecurityfor
their balancesâand 3dly, a commutation of their
halt pay for life ; as they found that the meainre
was odious to their fellow-citizens, and would
prevent the happy intercourse they expe&ed on
their return to private life. The present pay and
settlement of accounts were immediately provid
ed for, and astofecurity for the balances, Con â¢
grefs relolved, u as to what relates to the provid
ing of security for what shall be found due on
such settlement, that the troops of the United
States, in common ivith all the creditors of thefame r
have an undoubted right to expe<sl such security,
and that Congress will make erery effort in tfteir
power to obtain from the refpe&ive states sub
stantial funds adequate to the objeA, &c. &c."
As to the commutation, it Was urged on the
part of the army, that five or fix years full pay
was but a reasonable sum to make good their fuf
ferings, not only on account of the deficiency at
their pay, but also on other accounts, and that
it wiukl be more agreeable to their fellow-citi
zens, than that they ihould be pensioners for
life. Mr. B. mentioned this from his memory,
which he said was confirmed by the Journals of
Congress of February 1783, when a resolution
proposed, was prefaced in this manner: "Where
as in consequence of the faithful services of the
officers Â«f the aimy of the United States, and of
their great [offerings y not only on account tf the defi
ciency of their pay, but on other accounts, Congress
have, by divers resolutions, promised them half
pay, &c. &c. The want of money having been
raised as an objection against this measure, the
officers contended, that they expected nothing
more than certificates for their balances, in the
fame manner as other creditors of the United
States had received. Congress finally determined
to grant their request ; but to prevent the army
from alienating their certificates at an under
rate, and ( thereby affedting the public credit, it
was proposed that they (hou'd not be made tranl
ferablc. As soon as the delegation from the ar
my were made acquainted with this, they spurn
ed at the idea, and juflly a Iked if they were not
freemenâif the balances were not their own
property ; whether they had not the fame right
to diipofe of their property as they pleased, with
every other citizen ? They therefore insisted to
be put on a footing with every other creditor
who had received certificates. The r afoning
was too forcible to be anlwered with propriety,
and therefore Congress on the 22d March 1783,
resolved, 4< That such officers &c. lhall be en
titled to receive the amount of five years full pay
in money or securities on interest at 6 per cent,
per annum, as Con grefs {ball find nwft conveni
ent, instead of the half pay promised for life; the
faidfccuriiies to be such as Jhall be given to other crt
driors of the United States, provided it is at the opti
on cft.be tines of the rtfpehiveflqjes to accept or re
fufe the fame." " That with regard to the retiring
officers, the commutation, if accepted by them,
Jhall he in lieu of -whatever may be norv due, as ivelt
as what might hereafter become due. This
commutation amounted to 4,500 dollars to a
coloncl, and 2,400 dollars to a captain.
(Debate to be continued. J
Wednesday, January 23.
A communication from the Executive of the
ftate.of Maryland was read, by which it appears
that William Hindman, esq. is clewed a repre-Ontative in Congrefc from that {late, to sup
ply the' vacancy occasioned by the resignation
of lofhua Seney, esq. .
A petition of William Crow, relative to an
improvemunt in fire arras, was read, and refer
red to a felea committee.
Mr Parker moved, that the report of the
Secretary of War, on the petition of Thomas
Wifliart, should be referred to a leiea commit
tee This motion was agreed to, and Mr bark
er ' Mr. Gordon and Mr. Afhe appointed.
On motion of Mr. Hillhoufe, the report of
the felea committee on the petition of Ezekiel
Scott, was again read, and referred to a com
mittee of the whole on Saturday next.
Mr. Giles moved the following refolutions,viz.
Refo'ved, that the President of the United
States be requested to cause to be laid before this
House, cop.es of the authorities under which
loans have been negotiated, pursuant to the
of the 4th and nth of August 179Â°. to f
with copies of the authorities during the ap
plication of the monies borrowed.
Resolved, That the President of the United
States be requested to cause this House to be lur
ruihed with the names of the persons by whem
and to whom, the refpeaive payments ot the
French debt have been made in fiance, pur u
ant to the ad for that purpose, fpecifying the
dates of the refpeaive draughts upon the com
millioners in Holland, and the dates of the re
fpeaive payments of the debts: A fimi.ar ftate
nVent is requested, refpeaing the debts to Spain
and Holland. . .
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury
be direaed to lay before the this house, an ac
count, exhibiting half-monthly, the glances be
tween the United States and the bank of the
United States, including the several prancfe
bunks, from the commencement o. those witi
tutions to the end of the year 179 a.
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury
be direaed to lay before this House an account
of all monies, which may have tome into the
finking fund, from the commencement of that
institution, to the present time, fpecifying the
particular fund from which they have accrued,
and exhibiting, half yearly, the funis uninveft
Â«d, and where deposited.
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury
be direaed to report to this House the balance
of the unapplied revenues, at the end of the year
1792, fpecifying whether in money or bonds,
and noting where the money is deposited ; that
he also make report of all unapplied revenues,
which may have been obtained by the several
loans authorifedby law, and where such monies
are now deposited.
Mr. Giles dated in brief the reasons which
influenced him in bringing forward these refelu
tions. The leading motive, he observed, was
to obtain information. The refolutious being
handed to the S. eaker and read. Mr. Giles
atked leave to lay on the clerk's table a copy of
the reatons which he had offered in their sup
port. No objeaion being then made, the paper
containing thole reasons was handed to the clerk;
afterwards some members objecting to the pro
ceeding as unprecedented and informal, the pa
per was withdrawn.
The House then took the resolutions into con
sideration, and agreed to all of them without a
division.
Mr. Greenup laid before the House a repre
sentation &r resolution from the legislature otthe
slate of Kentucky, refpe&ing the aiSl of Con
gress making provision for the debts of the
United States, so far as refpeÂ£s the aflumption
of the state debts, and a eopy of the inftru-fHons
to their Senators and Reprefcntatives, relative
thereto.
In committee of the whole, on the bill to au
thorize a loan in the notes or certificates of the
ieveral slates, &c. Mr. Steels in the chair.
Mr. WilJiafnfon's proviso was taken into con
iidergtion.
Mr. Macon offered another in lieu of Mr.
Williamfon's; the purport fpecifying particular
ly certain notes of the state of North-Carolina,
which that state had proscribed, and which he
proposed (hould be excluded from the loan now
under consideration. The certificates are those
i fitted at Wurrenton in 1786 ; certificates to pay
for a militia expedition against the Indians in
1788; and certificates iigned Patrick Travers.
Mr. V/illiamfon withdrew his motion, and
that moved by Mr. Macon was agreed to.
Several other amendments were moved, but
not agreed to.
The committee having gone thro* with the
difcuflion of the bill, rose and reported it with
sundry amendments. The House took the fame
into considerationâand agreed thereto.
Mr. Mercer then renewed his motion for a
provil'o, refpe&ing alignments or transfer- of
state certificates ; the obje& is to exclude from
the loan all certificate's so transferred or afligned,
from the firft day of January to the firft
day of June following.
Some further debate took placeâlt was urg
ed in support of the motion, that the provision
now to be made for a certain description of pub
lic creditors, is merely a benefit; in cont'd ling
which, the government had a right to annex
what conditions they thought proper ; that it
was the duty of the legislature to take raeafures
to prevent those at a diltance from the feat of go
vernment from being speculated upon, to their
great injury and loss; that imputations have
been thrown upon the members of the legisla
ture, in refped to the advantages taken of the
uninformed on the firft assumption ; and there
fore, as an opportunity is now offered to the
Jioufa to purge themselves of all suspicions of
improper motives, the amendment ought to take
place. In answer to the objection on the provi
so's being retrofpe&ive, it was said, that it had
relation tofuch silignments or transfer? only, as
have taken pku e iincc this a& originated.
In oppo&ticn to the proviso, it was said, that
the prefrnt bill was not merely a bounty or bene â¢
fit conferred on the creditors; ir is a measure
jaft, rcafonuUcaud proper in itlelf; and on this
principle only it is to be juftified. Tt was further
urged, that the proviso was uncoriflittitional,
having a nioft ijuanifeft retrofpeaive operation,
interfering with contraas which the parties at
the time had a most undoubted right to make,
and thus altering the value of their property ; it
was reviving the principle of defcrimina.tion be
tween the original holders and the assignees, a
principle that had been so pointedly reprobated
by a large majority of the legislature on a former
occasion.
The Ayes and Noes were moved on Mr. Mer
cers proposition ; but the debate continuing till
after three o'clock, the House adjourned with
out calling the names.
Thursday, January 14.
After reading and referring feverai petitions,
the House refumcd the consideration of the bill
authorizing a loan in the notes or certificates of

ExtraEl of a letter, dated Liverpool, Nov 7, 1792.
u Enclosed are the returns cf the prices of
corn, copied from the London Gazette. This
port, we expefl-, is not to open this month to
ibreign wheat. 1 "
We are informed, that the Ele&ors of the
State of Kentucky, voted for George Wash
ington and Thomas Jefferson, as President
and Vice-President of the United States.
Capt. Henly, who was supposed to be killed,
at the time his party was attacked and de
feated on the Cumberland path, is now a pri
soner at "Will's town, in the Cherokee nation.
Milton, in his Areopagitica, or Treatise on
the Liberty of unlictnfed Printing, has this fine
energetic Sentence, which may be applied to
the French Revolution :â u Methinks I fee
in my mind a noble and puiflant Nation, rou
sing herfelf like the fitting Man after Sleep,
and fliaking her (invincible Locks; methinks
I fee her an Eagle renewing her mighty Youth,
and kindling her undazzled Eyes at the lull
and Mid-Day Beam ; purging and qnfealing
her Jong-abuTed Sight at the Fountain itfelt
of heavenly Radiance, while the whole Flock
of timorous and Noisy Birds, with thoje that
love the Twilight, flutter about, amazed at
what she means, and in their envious Gabble
would progiYoiticate a Year of Seifts and,
Schisms."
The word Republican, according to a late
definition of the term, in a letter, said to be
written in London, ought to be fceuted as well
as the word Arijlocrat.âla that letter, Repub
licans, Tories and Aristocrats, are represented
as animals of one and the fame speciesâthe
word Democrat only, conveying the true idea
of a real friend to liberty and equality. â
What Tyroi our mod enlightened and patriotic
citizens are in the school of politics!â Surely
mankind have been mistaken in supposing that
the belittled and belittling inhabitants of the
United States could exhibit any originality of
character, or any example from which the
European world could take a hint with advan
tageâNo, this ntve* can be.
The import of certain ftrittures on the con
duct ot the Chief Magistrate of the Union a
inounts to thisâSuperior merit may repeat
edly concenter the luffrages of all the people
of the United States in his favor in a moll
unexampled mannerâbut from that moment,
it ia a degradation of the republican charac
ter, for am individual to pay him (ommo*
re/pest. , . .
The tables are fairly turnedâThe exam
ple of the United States has been proposed for
the imitation of all the reft of the worldâ
but it seems we are now left in the rear by
our Gallic allies, in the glorious race of Li
berty ; and their example is in turn, con
stantly cited by some fupe'ior friends to the
lights of man for a model to this country. â
We may very Ihortly expect to hear that ex
perience is the most treacherous guide in poli
ticsâ honesty hardly dares ftiew her head at
the prcfent time.â
Every point gained by the present CongreJr y
conducive to the protection and jprefervation
of the public credit, may be justly cobfidered
as tending to contra&ii.g the sphere of fpe
culatioo "-for though there can be little doubt
hut that a majority of the next Congress will
be influenced in their decisions by those prin
ciples of Zionejly and public faith y which have
governed their p rede cellars vet from present
appearances it is but natural to anticipate a
variety of manoeuvres to subvert the funding
lyftem, in such niahner as again to open the
flood-gates of that reprobated business.
No government can trifle with the public
credit with impunity. The ideas ot honest
men on this point, are as transparent as the
rays of truthâtbey are always just, delicate
and exquisiteâAn adherence to theplain max
ims resulting from these principles, will prove
the salvation of a country,when every other in
ternal resource is exhausted. It is to be hoped
there will never be found a class of men in
this country who will be so hardy as openly to
propose applying the fpunge to the public debt
âbut it is but one remove from this to excite
suspicions of the public honor.

science from thai Veil under which for so many
