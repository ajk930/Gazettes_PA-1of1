CRITIQUES
On the ODE of the Hon. J. 5, Esq.
THE Hon. J. S. Esq. having finiftied his
reading, fat down. The Chairman quef l
lioned, 44 have heard the Hon.
Members Ode,have you any remarks to make
on it !" The Hon. j. N. roseâ 4< I move,fir,
that the firft twenty lines' or so, be re-read,
and that we then proceed to make criticisms
on it." 44 NoâMr. Chairman, the Hon.
A. J. D.) I think that unneceflary ; the gen
tleman has read it to admiration, fiis voice
%vas uncommonly audibleâl verily believe
extended three quarters' of a mile. I pro
ceed to oblerve that, in the Ode kind, I scarce
remember to have read any thing equal to it
â¦âWe know fir, among the ancients, it was
* law tf ufagc, to address the rul ng Deity, or
tlÂ»e one whom the poer supposed to be his
guardian ; to this preceiitru the Hon. gentle
man was attentive, and has a&ed accordingly.
He fuppoics his genius, to be something di
vine or human, bird or beast, or perhaps all
four, and as an evidence that birds are not
wanting irr sagacity, he brin?* the infta*Â»ce of
the Ho nan gooseâl remember, fir, that the
great Lyric Poer,, the Thcban Pindar, in his
%rft Olympic Ode, inferibed to Hiero, of Sy-
U+% with wonderful art praised. water
as being better than taint} and I suppose he
would add, than ftrong-becr, punch, grog, or
any other liquor ; but notwithstanding that po
et's unparalcllcd I think the Hon. gentle
man has fairly out-pindar'd him. For the
Goose, we all know, lxath long been held in
contempt ; and although this particular fnf
ltance is in the gentleman's favor, yet it re
quireth astonishing labor to make any thing
of a Goose, and, in my way of thinking, the
gentleman hath so perfectly and with so muctl
acutenefs of understanding, raised the great
qualities of this bird up to admiration, and to
a level with his own exalted genius, that he
may be said to have far excelled the ancient
poet. I feel myfelf in honor bound thus pub
licly to pay my mite of applause to the in%rni~.
cus author ; and I must confefV, as he hath so
eminently dignrfied the sagacity of the
1 more willingly subscribe to his opinion that
msn may be made a poetâlndeed every line
by which the Hon. gentleman has extolled that
Gvofe, (by Which I <uppofe he means his genius)
compels me to embrace his translation of Ho
race's text, given at our former meeting.'*
Hon. J. S. rose aÂ»rd fz-Jdy 44 Sir, f am very
deeply indebted to the Hon. gentleman for
the praise which he has been pleased to bestow ,
on meâBwt to be candid, as friends lTiould
be, I really fear the gentleman means flatte- j
ry, when he fays I'otic-Pindar the vnpardleiled (
PindanâHowever that may be, the gentle- ,
ihan well obferveth, that it is a difficult mat
ter to raise the'fame of the Goofe t s*horn man
kind have so fhamefulfy degradedâBut' 'tis
with me a confirmed and eftablilhed belief,
that within the com pass oj this 7 evolving Oib on
which I now stand, from the getting up of the
all-imparting fun to his place of going to bed,
there is not an animal who, in particular faga
citie* eqtlak the Goose, (bye the way wild gee/e
are wiser than tame ones) âand although I did
not immediately address the Goose as my geni
us, yet I think I in part derived my. conning
from that animal, as well as from J'atly"*â
Here the Hon. J. N. questionedâ' u I suppose,
fir, you mean the wild goose ?" Oh ! yes !â
yes, yes ; replied the Hon. poet, and contnu
edâu Gentleman* I have no doubt but you
have been filled with admiration to an higher
degree, in contemplating some other parts of
my ode- TJÂ»e idea off iW-paeM
ing in the mireâ>l think peculiarly poetical
and happily exprelTed, as is also that of Fancy
pricking our robs"âThe Hon. Poet was again
interrupted by the Hon. J.N. who, looking
over the Ode as it lay on the table, cried out,
%i Got the feat for ! pray what do you
mean fir ? Who got the feat for you, did'nt
I help ? I'm sure you're very ungrateful not
to mention W, did'nt I help?" At this in
ftatit the contagion spread itfelf through the
bread of every member, even the Chairman
himfelf, and the study ruttg with the cry of,
44 Ah ! ungrateful! I help'dâr help'd-âI
help'dâThis uproar continued, in defiance ot
all the efforts which the Hon. J. R. made to
restore order, for the purpose of explaining â
For although the Dolor's voice could be dis
tinguished from all others, yet as he joined
the cry of u I help'd, I help'd"âand used
his bung-driver to produce noise instead of
silence, the Hon. J. S. found it impolfible to
obtain order, until the throats of the gentle
men became dry, by their great exertions,and
required something to moisten them, which
the Hon. Poet perceiving, he apologized, and
and ordered some clarietâ-When five
bottles were emptied, the Hon. J Sâ
rose u Gentlemen had you fuffer'd me
to explain, you would not have charged
mc with ingratitude ; on a more attentive in
fpeftion you will fee that 1 have inserted
what our Jriend Jinimy Oâs told me, the
morning after my eleftionâlft that congra
tulation he fays we, and I have marked it for
itaTickâln that Â«*, gentlemen you are all in
cludedâYet you must know that not ycu only,
but one of my genius's was also very service*
able in helping me to the feat. This genius
was DiEmulation, or Fafehood, or any similar
beingâHad I not been aided by ker or him> in
complying with vulgar prejudices, and feigning
honesty and patriotism, I lhould not have ob
tained' m* present honorable ftation âYou
will likewise perceive that I hare prayed far
a continuation of her or his support, and as
/he or he has hitherto preserved me, I hope for
her or his future aid.*' The Hon. J. N. roleâ
44 Mr. Chairman, I wish to apologize, I ani
afaamed of my conduct, I did'nt fee that the
worthy gentleman had remembered usâ-but I
was mistaken, and I hope he'll pardon meâ-
I allow the gentleman likewise to be '111 the
light, and judicious in his prayer to his de
ttiful genius, far really'fi'<y ludicrous are the mo
-1 deÂ»n notions of our people in this town, that
he and all of a* must seek this comforter and
assistant." The Hon. A. J. D. then spokeâ
u Sir, our Hon. friend has apologized for us
all* and I (hall proceed to remark, that the
simile of the gentleman's blo-id creeping thro*
his veins like an eel, and then working like
bottled beer, and driving out the corks that
stop the fountains of infpirarion, are admira
ble. He has here displayed a skill in the art
of climax, which I think unparalelled. Virgil

ofuSneas, made some good fimilie'! antl
climaxes to exprefs-the greatness of the pafli
on with which the mind labored, but in all
the twelve books of the iEneid, there is not
one palTage which can stand a comparison with
that in the ode before nsâBy the manner in
which the poet, our Hon. friend rises, and the
spirited apoftrophcâ u Now, Thomas, listen
now, for now my Ode," &rc. 'tis evident his
prayer had succeeded, and his fountainsof iiv
fpiration were all completely uncorkedâ<t-A* I
view the various beauties of this Ode, J, fir,
feel myfelf inspired. But how shall I find lan
guage to flafli upon your minds, the bold, dar
ing, extravagantly sublime beauty of the si
mile in the sixty-ninth and seventieth lines,
<vhere the Hon. Poet fays, his ode ihall ru&
abroadâ
44 Ltttd as o'er the wall,
" The mill-pond waters rearing, Jloundering /aft.*'
Sir lam loft in contemplation of itâl can
not go onâl mult fit down."âThe Hon. au
thor then lifing laidâ" Mr. Chairman, my
honorable and elteemed friend, ha? this even'
ing fully compjnfated me for the clifagi eeable
er.'.otions which he excited in thy bosom at
our former meeting. He ha-! done me the
highest justice, he has spoken with all the ar
dor of jtncerity and his observations are exact
ly fimilai to my own, during the period ot my
composing my ode.âBut fir, there is one rruth
which candor obliges me to confefs to you.â
My violent exertions in producing that last
simile, of the mill-pond waters, by which my
Hon. friend has been overwhelm'd, were so
exhausting, in fact so entirely fuhverfivo of
the laws of nature, that on the moment of
my giving the last stroke of my pen to the
line, my left hand seized its brother ear, my
right hand was fixed, my body motionless, and
at bottom rooted to my chair ; and for near,
ly one hour, I fancied myfelf a tea-put, filled
with fcakling water."âThese words dift'ufed
over the countenance of the chairman a broad
stare of dilbelief, which, the poet observing,
he said, " However this relation may appear,
'tis free from poetical iiftion, 'tis literally
true âand I account Tor this belief, partly by
the perturbation of my mind, and partly by
the excelfive heat of my blood, which bring
ing into my recollection hot water, and that
HifcioJ ofen contained in rea-pots, canfed the
completion of my deception. The Chairman
said, he had in the course of his pra&ice, met
with inft'ances of a similar nature, and that
the gentleman traced the caute from the tf
feft, with much acutenefs and penetration,
aud although for a moment he doubted the
fad, he was now very well convinced of its
truthâ" indeed (added he) I myfelf, being
one day greatly exasperated by the neplect of
my butcher, in omitting to fend home lome
beef-ftaaks, imagined myfelfa bull-dog & went
up to the market for thepurpofe of tearing the
butchet to pieces; but feeing his bull-dog un
der his fliamble, and believing him larger than
myfelf, I was deterred from executing my
intention, and so sneaked off' home. The
Hon. A. J. D. saidâ" For my part I do
not doubt theveracity of my Hon. friendsâ
Both cases I think more than probable. But
to pursue our critiques. I admire the noble
and apostrophizing (pirit with which our poet
breaks out into, "Hark! hark! Tom! &c.
but I think he has not shewn fufficient ref
peft towards us, his si ienils, when he faysâ
" but still our Gâvânâr tboufhalt remain,
as long as / thy smile and nod can gain."âÂ»
And I also think he has not exhibited a proper
refpeet to his Hon. friÂ«nd JVJr. Gâlââll
when he promifes/oUly and alone, to cram the
countrymen's gullets with his bank fchetne ;
I mention not these things as objections to
his poerry, for I call that exquisite, particu
larly the metaphor, of cramming the coun
trymen* gullets,, as they do Tuikev-cocks,
Geese and such like animals; but there seems
a want ofgenerofity, he does not allow us and
his friend arÂ»v merit âIf I am wrong the gen
tleman will pteafe to set me right. 1 ' The
Hon. poet stood up, " Mr. Chairman, 1 rife
to explain ; I mean no difrefpeft to any one
of my friends. In that, /, to which my friend
objects ve are all included. 1, is intended to
stand for weâin the fame manner as when

expences of government, by supplying the
places of the Tâfâr, Câmpâ1âr and
R g general, and prevent that fySem
of peculation which has hitherto exiftcd."â
Her? the Hon. gentleman was interrupted by
- a loud thumping of a cane on the fioor, ar.d a
d eadful cry of" What! What do you mean,
Sir?'' Turning round, in terror, he beheid
his Hon. friend J. N. brandiCiing his cudgel

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
December Jt.
TRIAL OF LOUIS Xyi.
VERGNIAUI), in a mofl eloquent speech,
deprecated tlie condemnation of" Lool*
by the Convention. '' What ICCmi rv have
we, (laid he) that those who how alcribe ail
the cafaistitics of the nation, all the distresses
of the people to LÂ»uis, w ll not, after h'n
death, impute them all to the Convention ?
What security have we that they will not tei!
the people, that they have only changed one
tyrant for another, that the calamities of
war, increaled by the accession of England ai>d
of Spain, are imputable to the Convention,
who, to gi atify their iuii of revenge, con
demned Louis to death ; that the Indigence
of the people and the want of energy â  m t!.e
government, are all imputable tn the Convcn.
tion ?âWhat security have \re that thfel'e
clamors of turbulence and anatchy may not
effect an union of the ariftoeracv, thirsting
for vengeance ; of misery, of change 1
of pity, which the fate of Louis will infpi e !
What security have we that, from among the
Judges of the 2d of September, will not appear
the Chief so much desired ? This Chief, CitU
zens,âah ! let him appear, it will be but to
fall beneath a thousand wounds. But what
will become of Paris amid these new tempefft
âof Paris, whole courage against Kings pop.
terity will admire, and will not believe tÂ»!at
this city has fuffered a liorde of bar ditti in its
bosom, to agitate and rend it to pieces by con*
vullive movementsÂ» And you, industrious ci
tizens ! who have operated tlie revolution;
you, whose facrifices are every day mulripli*d
by the necefiities of your com try, what wilj
become of you ? What resources will you
have ! What hand will dry vour tear , who
will comfort yonr families ? Will von apply
to your pretended friends ! Ah ! fly them
rather ; I will tell you their answer : When
you alk them for bread, they will fay, ' Go to
the quarried, and ravilh from the earth thole
bloody fragments which We have heaped up
in them. Would you have dead carca es and
blood? There they areâThere, Citizens, it
the nourishment they offer you."
He concluded, that every ast of the Con
vention, not directly or tacitly ratified by tin
people, was an ast of tyranny j that the peo
pie had promised inviolability to LouiÂ«, and
alone had the right to strip him of it; aril
that to them, in the Primai y Afiemblie;, his
fate onght to be submitted.
Dubois Crance oppufed tbe appeal to Um
people. 'It would be Convanlent, I grant, to
remove retponfihility from ourfeli es, but our
duty iÂ« to prelerve it entire. Victory alone
can decide between the mandatories of liberty
and tbe drfpots of Europe. Let us die, if be
ctfiary, bnt let us prefer ve the right offajjug

Coren FuftScr was for referring the Sen

More*u opposed it a-, a fbarce cf discord,
perhaps of civil war.

lONDOU, December 31.
OEKIX AX> CIHCU MUrANCtt-
Motions have been made in tfce National
Convention, for placing the troops in winter
quarters, and even for recalling the greater
part of them into the interior of France; but
no meafurv were takeri in putluante oi
them. Thlre was also a propol'al to place all
the Newspapers moi e immediately under the
influence of the Convention, and to appoint
Cominiffioners for making enquiries concern
ing the authors of them j but u[x>n this the
AlTembly palled to the Order of the Day.
Marat lias been denounced to the Conven
tion by Chabot, for having declared in his pa
per, though lunie'.vhat irfdireftly, rhat the
French people might find it neceilary to elect
for themselves a Chief. He immediately
mounted the Tribune, and defended himfeli,
in his usual way, with great violence, but, at
least, with equal art. A g'eat deal of tumult
ensued upon this; after which the AfTembly
palled to the Order of the Day.
The following character of tlie King of
France, given by MaUherbes, one ofhisCoun
fel, does both the parties great honor
" The King is a man of a lofty character ;
he has a strong and courageous mind, and he
is fuperios to all attacks. the King were
a Philosopher, or of tlie religion of the anci
ent Romans, where a fort of honor was at
tached to suicide, he might perhaps destroy
bimlelf'; but he is of tire Catholic religion,
which.forbids ielf-deftruftion. He is pious,
and as sincere a believer as nian can be: the
fear of difplealing God will always arrest his
arm.''
The French, after taking the free and im
perial towns ofAix la Chapelle, threw down
the statue of the Emperor Charles V. which
stood before the town-house, and erected the
Tree of Liberty in its place. The French
gtrrifon were under arms the whole time ; all
the inhabitants, however, kept in their hou
ses. This event, together with the addrefles
from Mayence and Frankfort, and the com
motions manilefted in moll of the towns ot
Brabant against tbe new Republicans, prove
that the people are quite recovered fronj the
enthuflafm with which their troublelome guells
at firff inspired them.
General Miranda, after taking pofleflion of
the town of Gueldre, the capital of Prufflan
Cuelderland, levied on the merchants of that
town 300,000 Dutch florins; 133,000 florins
were levied on the town of Meurs, and also
6000 pair of flioes, 4060 pair of boots, and all
the fluffs-and cloaths that could be found iu
the ihops and ware-houses, for the cloathing
of his troops. He took hpftages from both
towns for what could not be paid him inffantly.
A contribution of 100,000 florins has been laid
on the Abbey of Cloftercamp, and two Friars
have been taken as hostages for the payment.
The situation of Paris becomes every day
more critical. The lifts of proscription are
renewed and multiplied. Again they have
recourse to arbitrary imprisonment, as was
gra&ifed previous to the scenes of the 2d Sep
tember. Several Sections are in a state of in
furre&ion ; the conftjtuted authorities with
out power, commerce quite at a stand, and
every good citizen i$ heartily sick of the revo
lution. But the dread of the fcourgesof their
country obliges them to smother their griefs.
The late AcWrefs of the Deputies of the
province of Hainault to the National Conven
tion, contains foch a remarkable pafTage, that
we are induced to copy it literally from the
French Journals. It is as follows:
" Generous Frenchmen, said they, rescind
your Decree of the 15th of December, or you
speak to us as Matters, Sove
reigns, when you yourselves decree the cefla
tion ol'our Taxes and Public Revenues,which
you take into your own hands; and when you
order the management of our National Effects,
â when you pronounce, otherwise than through
ns, the extinction of our Political Societies or
Corporations, when yoo prescribe even the
confifcatien of private Property, which our
former Depots dared not do, when they de
clared us Rebels, and treated us as such."
So much for French Liberty ! !
I can a Sure you that the public opinion is
very much changed in favor of the King since
his appearance at tne Bar of the Convention.
Pamphlets in defence of his conduct are hawk
ed through all the ttreets, whereas, twelve
days ago to have uttered a Word in his favor,
might have been attended with deadly conse
quence s.
Count Lncchefini is gone to Vienna, in
quality of Mimfter from the King of Prutfia.
By an express from Amfterdaro, received
by Saturday's Dutch mail, we learn that the
troops of his Sardinian Majefly have gained a
signal advantage over the French in Savoyâ
that they had taken all their magazines at
Sofpelo; three standards; 50prifoners, and
killed and wounded a considerable number.â
The loss of the Sardinians was very inconfi
dsrable.
Tbe Flanders mail of Friday brought an
account of a riot at Offend, oecafioned by the
inhabitants attempting to cut down the Tree
ef Mberty, which the French fojdiers endea
vored to defend. One citizen was killed in
the affray.
Letters from Mentzofthe 22dult.fay, that
the French there are in perfect Tecuritv; that
the Prtrilians occupy the heighths of Naflau,
but are in great want of provisions and so

THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH.DAY,
Was yesterday celebrated, in this town, with
all those emotions of feftive gratitude, which
arise in the breasts of Freemen, who feel grateful,
that Heaven has thus far, prolonged the life of
a citizen, whose existence is deemed essential to
the welfare of his country.
The lifing fun of this anniversary of his natal
day, was saluted by a difchaige of 9 gnns, from
Liberty Square :
A very numerous companyof citizens dined
at Concert Hall; and after dinner, among others,
gave the following
TOASTS
J. The Day.âMay it ever be marked as a
Festival in the annals of Freedom.
a. The Hero of the DayâAWashinoton

3. The American UnionâMay its duration be
limited only by the boundaries of time.

In the Minutes of Thursday's Proceedings,
it was noticed that 'Mr. Murray moved
to tale the Bill concerning Bai!,Procefs
and Co/}s, ire. into consideration, and
that the Motion was seconded by Mr.
Key. Upon this occajion
Mr. MURRAY suggested the necessity of
giving a preference to this bill reported by him
some days finee. He declared that business pri
or in point of time; and superior in point of
dignity and consequence. The Judicial system
w;is inadequate to the objects of justice or of
coercion. Its defe&s resulted from the difficul
ty and novelty of the cafeâand as no nation on
earth, had in his knowledge, ever produced by
one exertion of wisdom a system complete and
efficient, it was not wonderful that the law in
question had it imperfeiftions. It was ifi' vain
to expe<St a complete theory of thisfortâWifdom
must correfl errors where they fliall appear; and
it will be but by gradual amelioration, that ws
can expect our system to reach any thing near to
pra&ical pcrfefliou He then offered a bill,
which, if the profefiional men would look stea
dily at, might be, if not a complete remedy on
its several points, at least a bottom on which
something good might rife. Bail, whether re
guarded as to the citizen or the revenue, was a
point of high importance, and the appointment
of commissioners of bail loudly called for, as a
measure to relieve the United States system from
an invidious c nip rifon with the fvftcms of the
state. The other ojijeits were before the house

in the bill r M if were onee fleidi
ly attended to he believed there would be no
difficulty on the fubjedt He hoped the refac
tions would not now be taken up. They requir
#d no concurrence of the Senateâa bill did, and
they ought to have time to examine the bill
which they would have if the house would at
tend to the fubje<st.

CONGRESS.
Saturday last the second House of Reprefen
atives of the United States closed its second
fetficjn, and adjourned without day.âln the
early part of the feflion, business moved with
no great celerityâbut towards the close, a
number of very ellential and important acts
were pafledâthe benefit of which, will he ex
perienced bp the Agricultural, Mechanical,
and Commercial Interests of our Country
while the public Revenue will be encreafed
without any additional public burthens.
Two of the great Departments of State
have been scrutinized in the courfeof the ses
sion-âand tho' at this early period in the. exift
enceofthe Government, the best feelings of
the human mind revolt from thp idea of cor
ruption in its administration, or the fmaMeft
deviation from the ftrirt line of rertitude and
honor, on the part of its pubiic functionaries,
yet, it must afford heart-felt fatisfartion to
every lover of his country,, and its glorious
Conflitution, to find on the severest investiga
tion, prosecuted by the firft abilities, that in
the opinion of a very large majority, not a
spot or wrinkle was found to fully the official
conduct of the high and responsible chararters
concerned.âMay the day be far, far distant,
when similar investigations, even tho' insti
tuted by the sacred jealousy of patriotism,
shall terminate in a less favorable result.
Thirty-two Arts were palled during the

4 * After a few days stay at Paris, I puifued
my route to the army, which was then 120 miles
diflartt. On my arrival at General Dnmou
rier's Head-Quarters, I was appointed fall Co
lonel iri the Corps of Artillery. My notunder
ftifrjding the French language has hitherto been
a great disadvantage to meâhowever, I have
made great progress in acquiring it, and hope
to be able to speak it fluently by the Springsâ
France is a glorious country, worthy of the Free
dom it enjoys.âSince I have been in the army,
have been almost in conflant motion. I have
been in two altionsâone at Mons, on the 6sh
November, and the other about a league from
this place, on the 28th. That at Mons was very
fevtfe, having been engaged in a cannonade
a boat 5 hoursâl had four 24 pounders under
my direction, in the open field, and engaged
three redoubts : (This action I think was not
quite.as.severe as that at MonmouthVr-The army
of France being ordered to the chargc, they
rushed on the enemy, and carried every thing
before themâWe have been pursuing them ever
since till within these three or four days past,
that the army has been halted here, for refrtfh
ment and pay : We expect to proceed to Co
logne, which is about 20 or 30 leagues farther,
in a day or twoâwhen there, it is generally be
lieved the campaign will close.âWhether I
(hall p*fg another in France, is uncertainâlt
will depend altogether on my having a proper
command.
The combined enemies of France have been
beaten in every quarter âThe Pruflians, Auf
trians and Sardinians, have fled before the French
army, even in their own territory.âThe Artil
lery of France is certainly superior to any in the
worldâlt is a noble corpsâand I consider it a
great honor to have been placed iii it in the fiTft
instance."
Extratt from Mr. Burke*s Speech in the Houje of
n 'â¢>
Commons, Dec. 29.
" The French, in all those countries into
which they had entered, had put that which
was highest at the bottom, and vice versa.
He took notice of the resolution of France
never to Ily down their arm l ! till they had
given liberty to alt those countries which they
had entered, and until that liberty was se
cured.
He here made a number of severe remarks
on Le Brun's hypocritical letter to the Na
tional Convention, relative to the meeting of
the Britirti Parliament, See.âHe observed,
that thro' the whole of that letter there was
not one word of the King, not one word of
keeping well with the Court of Great-Britain j
but he mentioned the nation of Great Britain
as free and generous- He separated the na
tion from the King and his ministers, and ap
pealed to the nation from the King.
Mr. Burke asked whether the good people
of this ccuntry could believe one word that
such a man fa'd f
He next adverted to Dupont confeffing in
the National Convention, that be was an
Atbeift, and that he sincerely believed that
there *ya* no God. He said, it was nnne
ceflary for him to touch upon this extraordi
nary cpnfeffion, after it had been divinely
handled by a Noble Lord (Lord Lougborough)
W another House.
It had, he said, been stated, that nineteen
aflaffins had come from France. âThese were
seven more than were fufficient to murder
the Royal Family. There were only two
hurdred murderers by trade who had com
mitted all the enormities in France in August
and September laflâbut there were tbou
fands connected with them, and who were
aiding and a/lifting. Some thousand daggers
were befpeke at Birminghan. ; how many of
these were to be sent abroad, and how many
used for home consumption, he could not tell.
Here Mr. Burke astonished the House by
drawing a long dagger, brandifliing it iu bis
band, fcnt! then thuowipgU violently rÂ»n tlÂ»e
floor. There, laid he, is tijc French frater
nity lor you. This is a dagger made exact
ly according to the directions to jtl e
gentlemen at Birmingham. When theFrcncfi
had thrown any nation into coniufton, hÂ«?d
destroyed their government, and plundered
them of their property, and had piuuged a
dagger into their bof'om, thejF fuid they had
frate.nifed that nation. He was extremely
obliged to the King's ministers for tiie pieient
bill, which he trusted would preserve his life
a? well as that of many other ot A>is jnajefty s
fubjedts."
COMMU NICATJOK.
If it is a mark of dtgrneracy in a republic to
pav difttnguifhed refpett to one citizen, lliuiln
oos more by niÂ» virtues than his office, u mutt
bit of confequencc very anftocrattc and aifctmng
in any one citizen to cultivate the virtut-s whicb
naturally infoite that refpedl ; such a citizen is
no other than an usurper of a distinction over
his fellow-citizens. - Rcfpcft is the shadow that
follows virtue, and where the iubftance is there
will be the shadow. It the shadow be anti-re
publican, more so is the fubflance. Nothing
therefore is so anti-republican as eminent ce
publican virtue ; the very potion of aristocracy
lurks in it. The pieces in fevtral Gaieties of
this city aimed at the magistrate of this
country have exhibited m various lorms this ex
cellent mode of reasoning. According to their
theorv we should keep on an exaÂ£fc levelâas vir
tue riiei above equality and ohtains diftio&ion,
so vice, and especially that mean one of offering
outrage to virtue and dignity, finks below the
level. Indeed to fink one is raising another. It
follows therefore that our contempt for the wri
ters of those pieces is anti-republican, Alas
thefc are flrait laced times when the most natu
ral emotions of our minds are eileemed viola
tions of our political duties.
