ADDRESS
TO THE CITIZENS OF
WESTMORELAND. WASHINGTON, FAYETTE AND
ALLEGHANY COUNTIES.
REVENUE LAW.
By JOHN NEVILLE, Inspector of the Revenue,
Survey No. 4, District-PÂ£nnsylvawia.
(conti NU ED.)
THE sale of the western lands is also mentioned by the com
mittee, as a resource for the purpose. This is something
more tubftautial ; and accordingly Congress have by law made
provision for appropriating the proceeds of the sales of those lands,
4S a fund lor finking the debt and freeing our country of its
burden. This resource is wifely destined for the discharge of
the principal. H Congress could honeltly have refrained from
making another provision tor the interelt, it would have been
very bad management to have done 10, and to have exhausted so
good a tund for extinguishing the principal, in the mere pay
ment ot mtereft. But Congress had not this option ; the honor
and credit ot the country, its faiety in time of future need, obliged
them to make provilion tor paying the interest annually in money,
according to their contract. The goverment, and the country
would have been the deriiion of the woild, if they had failed to
dilchargethis duty. And iutficient dependence could not have
been placed upon the produce otthe sales of the weilern lands, to
answer that end, if it had even been deemed expedient to eat
them out with intereii of the debt.
It may be thought, that Congress ought before this to have
passed an aÂ£t for the eftablifhmcm of a land-office. This business
has not been negle&ed ; some examination of the fubje& has been
made, but those who are aware, how many difficulties attend
the regulation of this matter, and how much difficult business
Congress have had on hand besides, will be leady to make allow
ances for the delay ; it is probable 100 that the disturbed ttare of
the frontiers has contributed 10 the suspension ot the land-office.
It may have been thought belt not 10 fell the land till the contro
versy with the Indians was finally fettled. But be this as it may,
the observations which have been made are, I trust, fufficient to
iatisfy you, that this fund could not have rendered an additional
tax unneceifary.
The committee ask, why not open an office for unpurchafed
lands, and give the holders warrants tor their debts ? The an
swer to this is plain : because it would be a violent breach of
faith and contract; bccaufe Congress, having promised to pay
the creditors in money; tooblige them, without their confcnt,
to take wild land, would be little better than not to p3y them at
all; because nations, like individuals are bound by mtefe(i:, as
weil as duty, to be honest, and to perform their engagements ;
because not to do it as tar as circuniftances permit, is we ak and
fooijftx, as weil as wicked ; bccaule the United States may again
be engaged m a war, and in such cafe would ag-am ivave occafiofl
to borrow money, and if they were to treat theis pnfent credi
tors in the manner proposed, they would never be trusted ;
because, in fine, the public bonds, or the evidences of the debt,
are as much the property of the holder, as his hat or his coat, and
to violate that property would be an aÂ£t ot tyranny ana oppression
in the government.
I lie truth is, fellow-citizens, that some additional revenue was
indispensable ; and that Congrels had no option, except between
a duty on diitilled spirits, and a tax on houses, lands, horses, and
Â« attic, and, it the tax now complained of were lo be repealed,
it would only be to make way tor the other.
Aieyou ler.oully of opinion, that it would be better to have a
tax on all your houses, lands and ttock than on the whilkey you
dittili or consume ? The committee ex pre Is an opinion that it
would be. But have they lufticicntly weighed the matter; have
they not rather coufulted their dtfiike to the present tax than ex
prelled your real fenuments in relation to the substitute ?
Remember, that a duty on spirits divides itfelt among all those
who confurne the spirits, whether they are the makers ot it, or
the purchasers troin those who make it ; but that a tax on laud
talis wholly on the proprietors of those lands ; are the proprie
tors ot lands among you prepared to take upon themselves the
who'e weight of the burden, rather than to thare it with other
dalles ot the community ?
Remember alio that a tax which might be laid by Congress on
lands, would be according to some g:neral rule, which would
operate alike in all parts of the State. It would not be pollible
to ihift the burden from one county to another. Can it be the
interest 01 the new fettled counties to fee a tax laid and colleÂ£led
upon luch principles ? think well of these matters, and
whether it be prudent to leek a change of the present duty for a
tax on your houses and lands.
Suffer me to appeal, upon the present occasion to your candor,
ou certainly remember that one ot the objections molt ilrenu
oufly urged againlt the prtfeiu constitution of the United States,
"was, that it gave Cougreis a power to levy dir.Â£l taxes : it was
then laid by the oppol rs ot the government, that the differenc
of cucumftances ot different parti of the union rendered it im
pollible tor them to - xerciie the power without opprellion. A
mongst thole who molt itrongly objected to direct taxes were the
representatives of thele wefterh counties, in the State convcniion ;
and i: was admitted by the friends of the constitution, that there
might be real difficulty in the exercise of that power, and that it
ought to be forborne as long and as much as pollible.
1 his objection extended throughout the United States, Amend
ments have been proposed to take the power from Congrels, tho
H has not been proposed to lelTcn or abolish their power to lay
Â«n excise. Would it have been wile in Congress, when they
'iad a choice, to exercise thus early the very power the poll". Hi on
Â«>l which was mod objected to ? Is it probable that an exercise ot
>r would have been better icliihcd than of the oue whicn has been
cxercifed ?
Congrcis, indeed, when the duty complained ot was laid,
could not have laid a direct tax, if they had defircd it. Dircdt
t'iXet by theconditution ate to be apportioned according to num
bers. Ihe cenliis to afcertairi these numbers was not taken at the
Ume of laying the duty on spirits.
I 1 el low citizensâThe committee indulge themfclves in an in
nifcrimiuate reprobation ofexcifes, but they do not lay what they
mean by the term. It is necessary to annex a meaning to it, and
to attend to the reafonablencls and confequencc* oi thai rcpioDd-
i he usual bonification of an excise, is an internal dutv on con
tnable coÂ«nuoUi4;c>. Ix evciv fucft due - lu its nature odious
ON THE
fUtI.V FFA'.VQ, N HI, :I-ST REE C, BETWEEN iECO.SD AND THIRD STREETS, PHILADELPHIA
and tyrannical ? if it be, then is the filiation of the fanner much
less eligible than I had ever supposed it to be. I will explain my
meaning. Duties on articles of coufumption naturally and gene
rally la.ll upon the. con turners. The idle man who lives on his in
come, the land-holder, the merchant, the lawyer, the mechanic,
in (hoi t every man vho consumes, pays his part of it; they are o!
course divided among the whole community. This is the more
important, b cause excilesare actually the greateit revenues of all
countries we know of, and prevail mod in the freeft governments :
but i! no internal duties on con! am able articles are to be laid, if
so important a branch of revenue is to be taken out of the hands
of government, how can the ch*Tm be filled but at the expenceof
the landed property ? What other fund can furnilK an excess ca
pable of (applying the place of lo confiaerable a resource ? And
how will \he farmer be able to struggle with this increase of bur
den ?
This point ought to be viewed with reference to future as well
as p.ift times; it excises may be proper taxes hereafter, they can
hardly be tyrannical now.
But in truth no good rcafon car. be afligned, why an internal
duty on a coniumable commodity is more improper than an ex
ternal duty on a similar commodity. Ail must depend upon the
regulations under which either is colleÂ£ted; either may be op
pressive or not, according 10 the nature of these regulations ; and
whatever objections can m any time be ju'ftly made on the fubjeft,
ought to be applied to the mode of colic&ion, not to the duty
itfclf.
And if any internal duty 'on articles of consumption is proper,
that on ardent fpints must be admitted to be the most proper* Ic
is not the less a luxurv from being the luxury of all classes. What
article can be imagined that ought to be preferred ?
I lhall now, fellow-citizens, state the leveral objections which
the committee have urged againlt the law, and I ihall lubmit to
your impartial decision a brief aniwer to each.
First objection. â¢' Excise laws are dangerous to liberty, and in
compatible with the temper of a free people."
Awlwer. The manner in which they are dangerous to libertv
ought to have been (hewn. In England, where there is a heredi
tary monarch, and the powrrs and prerogatives of the crown are
immense, the number of officers occafioncd by the great multipli
cation of excise laws, might be regarded as dangerous to liberty,
inasmuch as it might tend'to inci\'afe the influence of the crown,
already too great. But this does in no (hape spply to a govern
ment, at the head of which is an e eftive and responsible magis
trate of four yeaTS duration, with powers incomparably more
limirted, and coupled with a branch of the legislature in the ex
ercise of some of the most important of them; and which go
vernment has the power of appointing officers in only a limitted
number oFcafes. The difficulty of lepealing a dangerous clause
in an excise is greater too in Englaud by reason of an entire houfc
of hereditary nobler.
One great ofrje&ion to the excifalawin England, on the score
of danger to liberty is, the summary jurisdiction granted to
tf|e excise officcr invading the con â  <Â£ of the common law and the
trial by jurv , â¢no SUCH JURISDICTION ).> given by
the a6l in question.
Excise laws exist and are tolerated by the people in the freeft
countries of Europe ; and fhey have long exiftrd and been fub
mittc-d to in teveral of these States : and those among the tore-
Hi oft so; h' . tachment to liberty, and their exertions in our
revntutje- In eonnefticut they have been extended to foreign
articles r i consumption generally.
The above positions so contrary to all experience and faÂ£c, and
so incontinent with the neceflities of focieiy cannot tail to be er-
roneous.
Second objefiio'n. " Excises are odious on account of the
" powers of in (pelting and feaiching houses which are necef
lt farily given to officers to secure the collection ot the duty j be
u ing an invasion of domestic peace and private property."
Answer. The great body of confederate citizens generally
vrw excise laws as neceflary to answer the public exigencies,
without opprefling any particular class of the community, and
acquiesce in them accordingly. Some of the powers attending
fomeof the excise laws of Great-Britain have been complained of
even by sober men. Such is the power of the officer to visit and
search at his discreeion any house or building what
ever of the persons who deal in the excised article. But no such
power exists in the law which is the fubjelt of thiÂ« addrefr.

HOUSE OF R E P R FSE NTATIVE S,
FRIDAY, December 16.
In committee of the whole, on the Poft-Offics Bill.
TV/TR. VVADSVVORTH moved an amendment,
to withdraw the privilege oi Franking from
the members of both houses of Congress.
In fupportof this motion, ic was said, That the
grand fecnrity which the people of the United
States have in their representatives, is, that those
representatives are fubjeift to the lame regulations,
as their constituents : in the article of postage,
this was not the cafe : Congress in this cafe as
sume to themselves a privilege, which they re
fute co the people : they took money from their
constituents, and paid none theinfelves : the
people viewed this privilege with a jealous eye;
and could not be pleased to fee it enjoyed by
Congress, whlllt neither the members of the
Stare aflemblies, nor even the Governors were
indulged in ic : Congress enjoys only chartered
rights ; and all rights not expressly mentioned in
the charter, are of course excluded : the consti
tution is their charter : the Convention, who
framed it, had, no doubt, well considered the
whole fubje<st of privileges, and accurately de
fined all (uch as they vvilhed the legislative body
(hould enjoy diftindt from their conlticuents : in
the enumeration of those privileges, there is
not a (yllable tending to exonerate them from
their (hare of the common burden of postage:
they have no constitutional claim to such an im
munity j and if they adumed it, they would in
crease the burden on their constituents ; the polt
office if unable to maintain itfelf, mult derive
its support from other sources of revenue : alrea
dy, the members of both houses fend and re
ceive, during their feffion,as many letters through
the general pott-office, as all the other inhabit
ants of Philadelphia : those letters, if paid at
the ulual rates, would amount to half the post
age of the United States : the number and bulk
of the franked letters and packets excluded the
newlpapers from the mail, and thus prevented
the circulation of intelligence : if the evil en
creafed (and there was no probability of its be
ing diminished, except by the utter abolition of
the privilege) it would eventually prove the ru
in of the poft-office :âthe example of Britain
shewed to what an enormous height the abuse
of such a privilege may be carried : and though
similar abuses inay not as yet have taken place
here, yet it could hardly be doubted, that many
unnecedary letters were daily Cent by the post,
which never would have been written, if fub
jscffc to postage :âthofe letters are not only unÂ»
productive, but an aiftual expence to the poft
office, as the pofl-mafter receives a certain per
centage on these, as well as upon other letters :
the privilege of franking is moreover unequal in
its operation : while some members use it only
for the purpose of transmitting political infor
mation to their constituents ; others, absent per
haps during the whole session, use it for very
10,490 36
7Â»different purposes : to men in trade it was a con
liderable advantage, amounting probably, in some
instances, to a hundred dollars a year :âitwouid
be better to take away the privilege entirely, and
reduce the general rates of postage one half, or
to allow the members, at the close of each feiiion,
to make a charge for all letters on public bufi
liefs, from their constituents, or to make them
an allowance in gross to defray the expense of
postage :âbetter even, if neceliary, to make an
addition to the compenfatiou which the mem
bers receive for their services, if the present one
be found incompetent to their honorable support.
On the other hand it was observed, that the
privilege of franking was not aflumed by the
members, for their own private accommodation,
but for the benefit of their constituents, to tranf
jnit to them every neceliary information, rel
pedting the operations of the general govern
ment, and to receive from them i'uch informa
tion as they might have to communicate;âpe
titions are frequently enclosed to members ; and
if these were to be fubjetit to the payment of
postage, the privilege of petitioning the houle,
would be in a great measure defiroyed : the di
minution of revenue, which the poit-oiKce might
in some instances fuffer from the privilege of
franking, ought not to be deemed a furficient
reason for abolifliing that privilege ; since it was
allowed, that the object, contemplated in the
establishment, was the general convenience, and
an easy and speedy mode of diflemina.ing public
and private intelligence :ârevenue was but a se
condary consideration ; âalthough the citizens,
who live at the feat of government, and have
daily opportunities of learning from the news
papers what public measures are going forward,
may not be materially affeifted by the abrogation
of the privilege, yet the cafe would be widely
different, with those who live at a diltance, es
pecially when fifcal operations were on foot:â
those who are informed, will make a prey of
those who are ignorant ; and deftrucftive specu
lation will enrich the few, at the expense of
the many :âin a government of opinion (which
is the government of America) much greater re
liance is to be placed on the confidence of the
people, than upon any other circumstance :â
that confidence can only be the result of the ful
left information :âbut if the privilege of frank
ing were taken away, the avenues of informa
tion would be, in a great measure, closed ; for
the members could not undertake, at their own
private expense, to transmit intelligence to eve
ry part of the Union : yet the citizens have a
right to expedl information not only of the aifts
of government, but also the principles, upon
which they were grounded :âThe abuses of the
privilege, that have prevailed in England, do
not prevail here ; and its abolition would give
general difl'atisfaftion, particularly in the more
distant parts of the union, where information
would be fubjeÂ»st to a very high tax, if circulated
through the poft-office, at the ordinary rates of
postage : df those bundles of letters received arid
difpatclied by members of Congress, many (tho'
far from being unnecefTary, as had been laid)
would perhaps never be written, if they were
not to pass free of postage ; and thus that free
communication of sentiment between represen
tative and conflituent, which is so eflential in a
government like this, would be in a great mea
sure cut off; and the poft-office would gain little
or nothing by ir, as those packets of newspapers,
bills, reports, &c. would either be sent by pri
vate hand, or not sent at all : even here an in
equality would prevail, a? the people who live
near the feat ot government, and all along the
main road, could, from the greater frequency of
epportunities, receive such packets with more
ease and regularity, whilst those in more remote
Situations, could seldom or never receive them,
unless by the mail : the expense arifingfrom the
percentage to the poflmafter on the free letters,
is but trifling, as in such cases he receives no more
for a packet of two ounces, than for a single let
ter : and as to the idea of allowing the members
to make a charge for their letters, this would be
no better than receiving with one hand, and pay
ing away with the other: if however it were
found absolutely neceflary to take precautions
against the abuses that were apprehended, this
might be done, by limiting the number or weight
of letters that fliould go free by any one poll,
without entirely preventing the interchange of
sentiments between the representative and his
constituents.
MONDAY, December 26
The bill for carrying into effect a contra*fl be
tween the United States and the state of Pennsyl
vania (relative to the pnrchafe of a traift of land
bordering on Lake Erie) was read a third time

and lubftitute the following:
That all newspapers earned in the mail, and
which il 1a 11 be under cover open at one end, shall
be charged with the payment of one cent for any

contained varioos rellrictions on the privilegeâ
but an adjournment being called for, took place,
without a decisionâand the further confederation
of the amendments was postponed till to-morrow.

GENTLEMEN,
IT gives me great fatisfa<ftion to communicate

that exertions are making under the authority of

SIR,
I HAVE received your Excellency's letter of
yesterday, enclollng a copy of a representation
to you from the inhabitantsof Pittfburg, relative
ly to their apprehensions, in consequence of a late
defeat of the troops under Major-Gen.' St. Clair.
I can, with great propriety, a(I u're your Excel
lency, that it is my earnelt desire that all the ex
posed parts of the frontiers ihould be as effectu
ally protected, at the general expence, as the cafe
may require.
] shall dire<st the Secretary of War to confer
with your Excellency upon this subject, and to
inform you of such ineafures as have been direct
ed, and are in a train of execution.
I am, with due confederation,
Your Excellency's molt obedient servant,
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
His Excellency the Governor of Peniifylvaniu.
Philadelphia, December 28.
Wednesday lad Richurd Henry Lee, Esq. took
his feat in the Senate of the United States.
Two important bills are now before the Senate
of the United Statesâone for the encouragement
of the Bank and other Cod-Fisheriesâthe other
for the eltablifhmeUt of a Mint.
The project of uniting the Delaware and
Schuylkill by a canal, is an undertaking worthy
the enterprizing spirit of the times, and will
doubtless be carried into execution.
The number of paflengers which have arrived
in the port of Philadelphia in one year, with a
view to become settlers in this country* amounts
to twothoufand seven hundred and forty persons.
By an address from Gov. Telfair to the AlTem
bly of Georgia, it appears that the Treaty with
the Creek Nation, made by the United States, is
to be the fubjecft of animadversion in the Legis
lature of that State.â It is rather curious that the
fame Treaty does not meet the approbation of
W. A. Bowles, who is fomenting mifchief among
the southern Indians.
It is molt probable that the Treaty, from this
state of things, is just and right.

In the account of the deftruiftioti of the town
of Port-au-l'i ince, in Hifpaniola, which fad event
took place the 22A ult, it is said that the Mulat
toes set fire to different parts at the fame time
that 32 squares, with all that they contained of
produce, (tores and provisions, &c. were confum
e(l-âThe cannonading laded one hour after
ward, and the mufquetry continued the remain
der of the day, and during the night. Manyper
fons mull consequently have periihed.
Ex.traCi of a letter jrom a gentleman in the country,
to his Jrienr! in this city.
" Melancholy news from the Westward
Are not such repeated ttrokes indications that our
cause in that country is not good ? 1 think so I
fear we are too rath in our operations that way.
No doubt the Indians, dittnrbed on their native
foil, feel all the boilihgs of injured innocence
and were a few of their Chiefs in audience be
fore Congrets, perhaps they might plead their
cause to the confufion of many who think little
of themâtheir rightsâor of what ought to be
said in their favor.
" I hope such measures will be taken, or reso
lutions gone into in consequence of this defeat,
as (hall be confident with the great principles of
j'uftice, as well as national policy Have there
been any measures taken by government to make
peace with these unhappy people ?âlf fo,it would
tend to fatisfy the minds of our fellow-citizens
by making them publicâif not, what has notour
government to answer for > âDoubts on this head
give real distress to every serious friend to their
country."
Public measures are doubrlefs open to public
animadversionâbut our remarks should always
be seasonable, ourcenfures direifled by judgment,
and in all misfortunes tempered with this conil
deration,
" That profp'rous actions always pass for wife."
The business of fending newspapers by the
mail, may with the greatelt l'ecurity be put on a
liberal footing. The interell of Printers is very
little concerned in the matterâbut that of the
public is, and ought to be considered as deeply
involved. If by an ealy feafible plan the trans
portation of newspapers is facilitated, theftreanis
of information will be wide and copious, especi
ally for a seasonâbut as in all other cases where
individuals difFufe their property, and encreafe
their debtors for final) funis, and at a distance,
inevitable loss ensues, so it is in this of Printing ;
and nothing but the greatest facility and certainty
in transporting the papers, will give the buiinefs
of an extensive circulation any degree of liability.-
There is not a government on earth which is so completely in
the hands of the people as that of the United States. By prel'erv
ing and strengthening it, the people secure their own power. For
they have no other means of a&ing as a people, and it is not easy
to conceive of any half as effectual. The state governments reach
to almost every object. The national government seems to be in
the air over men's heads, and barely touches their individual con
cerns. The power of tne latter is so limited, that it is little, and
so divided with the state governments, that it is lcfs than the letter
of the constitution seems to give : It has fewer officers than any
fovercign government in the world. Look round, and fee how
few there are who have more than a common interest to support it.
It is a trust, and a precious one in the people's own hands to keep
it inviolate. It is their own; therefore it deserves their confi
dence, and will reward their care.
