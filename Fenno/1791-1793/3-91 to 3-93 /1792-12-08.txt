formed pnl c,-a:iy plausible argument upon
that ground, after it was efiablifhed, that
the French court and Dutch company
were equaliy anxious for the contract, anil
'itd solicited our approbation of it. For
ftirely, in such an event, we had a right,
and without the fmaileft breach of morality
or deiua 9, to weigh and determine which

It state's, that in 1756, it being known the
French ton. t were diftre.Ted for money, a
Company ot Dutch merchants had offered to
of them the. American debt, of twen
ty-four millions of .ivres,ior the sum of twen
ty, and that their jembatrraffrnents inclined
them to accept of the proposal : That howe-
a ticlav was ocfaftoned, 011 the part of the
French court, by the apprehension it might j
ieilen our credit in Europe, and oe dilagreea
â¢le to ; whereupon he had been con
iulted by the agent of the company, and to
tvhom he liad replied, that he was neither au
thorized to approve or disapprove of the
tr an Taction. Having stated the proposition as
Jbove, he observes further upon it, in its re
Jation to his country, that if there be a dan
ger our public payments may not be punctual,
it might Ik? better that the discontents which
â Would then arile, fiiocid be transferred from
a coui t, ol whose good wijl we have so much
Iveed, to the breasts of a private company.
Rut that it had occurred to him, we might find

court, and efiablifh with them a confidence in
our honor: Thap our credit was good in Hol

to Franco, and pay them the whole debt at
once . Tnis would save them from any lpfs

111 his Jufifrrffin of the otljer parts of the .para

wile, in the ulceration of a part of the sentence

not to it. The paflage in the letter
referred to, reads precifejy a, I have ft:.ted i*
abiiv;. Catnl'us has altered it bv the infec
tion 1 1 tne toilowing words," Ifubnii whether y'
âJT whic. tiie import of that sentence, and
especially wiien standing alone, has been va
ried. It therefore the statement which I
have give ~ is correct, it follows that Ca
tullus has been guilty of misrepresentation.
and that the extract fumifted by,him i 5
Jalfe, aecept i": and mutilated.
V het 1 ir t.e author ot these pieces lias beep
guilty of tli.. breach of official duties, in' tne
publics ion of any thiug reiativg to Mr. jef
terim 5 jetrc-.-, i know not. a variety of
reaions, of but litre importance to the puh
l.c, and which 'tis not neceflary for me to re
count, have created a belief, that thev pro
ceed from Mr. Hamilton. If Co, it will be
difficult for him to remove the imputation.
The perulal of the extract in fS 7, w'.n out
of Office, and the fafe preservation of it fine'e,
will r,ot juftify its publication by the pre'e-it
acting Secretary âf the Trealm'y ; nor does
it authorize a belief, if he is the author, that
the official document in Ins poifefiion, has not
been resorted to since. Will it be contended
that the conduct of the officer at the head of
t.iat department, should be scanned in this in
stance, bv the duties of the station hi held five
or ten years pad ? Or, in other words, that
the office, imposes on him no particular obli
gations, and which he is bound to regard ?
Con fide ring this attack upon Mr. Jefierfon
in the comniencement, as an attack upon
principles; knowing that the conflicting in
terests of parties were at work, and that the
one which was fufpefted, with tow much rea
son, to be attached to monarchy, would en
deavor, as an obstacle in its way, to undermine
not only him, but every other republican cha
racter iu the confidence of their countrymen;
and believing, as well from the duties of his
official station as his known delicacy inobferv
ing them, he would difregaid it, I thought it
in some measure a duty I owed to tliofe prin
ciples of equality which I venerate, to take
up the subjeCt, and place it on its proper
ground. So far, then, as any imputation has
been raised, against a diftinguiihed and patriot
citizen, I have furnilhed the reply, ancj I pre
sume, shewn no f only his innocence of any im
propriety in the allegations suggested, but
likewise the impurity of the motives which
dictated the attack.
It now remains only, in justice to the au
thor of the papers under the of An
Amtriian and Catullus, to fettle the facta whe
ther he has been guilty of misrepresentation,
and the breach of an olhcial duty, in the fn
itance alledged; and I have every poflible
disposition to concur, on my part, in those ar.
ranrements which may be necefi'ary to dispel
every doubt on that AibjeCh The truth may
be ascertained, by a recurrence to the depoijts
in either of t e departments, of State, or the
Treat ury. If Mr. Hamilton is not the au-
thor, and will announce it, I shall consider the
subjeCt as unworthy of further notice : if it
is neither denied nor owned, but the alterca
tion continued without any proof being pro
ducedâfor none has yet beenâl shall like
wise consider it beneatn my attention ; but if

SEPTEMBER 28.
M-Lafource reminded
Hon that ;he order of the day \vj.
the election ol" a Minilter War
J he Aiffrages of leveral Memb'ci:
having fallen on I'oine of the depu
ties of the National Convention, i
debate took place on this vciy im
portant qiieition, Whether Mem
bers of the Convention wei e
Ide not only to places in the Mi.iiT
"7, but alio to other inipouiwu if
fices in the Republic ?
Some were ot opinion that the
MiniJlers ought to be chosen from
among all the Citiz-ns rtitiuuit dil
tinciio.i, wniVe m tiers ii. L /iit ua
the contrary, that this wonUrbe en
dangering tiie Republic ; becaofe,
laid they, intriguers would then in
fallibly find the means ol procuring
votes tor theinfclves or their friends
in such a manner, that they might
afterwards infiiience the Conten
tion, and consequently the opera
tions of the Miniilrjr. ihi ' lalt
idea was explained in a very clear
and faiisfatftory manner by Leeoin
tre Puyraveaux ; and after a long
debate the Convention deci eed, th.it
Miuilters could not be chosen fioox
among the Deputies.
This decree brought on a difcÂ»f
fioii iel'peifting the two Ministers,
Roland and Servan, who both per
filted in giving in their refiguaiion.
The furiner, because he bad been
chosen a Deputy to the National
Convention ; and the fatter because
the itate of his health did not per
init liim to support the fatigues of
office.
A member here bettowed the
highest prailes on the two Ministers,
and reminded the Convention of the
important fei vices they had render
ed to their country, to which they
had facrificed the greater part of
their property. " On these confi
derations I think every good citi
zen must wi(h that Roland and Ser
van would retain that post in which
they have been placed by the con
fidence of the nation. I move, there
i'ore, that the'e citizens may be in
vited in the name of their country
to continue to serve it."
Jean ile Brie (aid, this would be
offering an iiifulr to stlier citizens,
as it would amount to a declaration
that none of t lie in were capable of
filling up places in the Miniitry.
Btizot was of opinion that the
Convention was the difpenfei of the
gratitude of the nation, and that ic
would not disgrace idVlf, as iiad
been pretended, bj. inviting beivan
and Roland not to quit their func-
tions,
The discussion was about to be
terminated, but a member having
u)ovcJ ; that Danton (hculd alio bs-
[Whole No. --7.1
/ /invited to discharge, at least pro
visionally, the duty of Minilter ol
Jultice, that member exprefled his
indignation lhatthe representatives
of a free people (hould debafethem
felves so far as to invite. â¢' It is
probable and eveu certain (con
tinued Damon) that the Minilier of
War cannot yield to your invitation,
as the (Vate 'of his health will not
permit him ; and is it not a real
disgrace toyou to expofeynurfelves
to the mortification of a refufal i â
But as every one here has the right
of expreliing his fentimenfs, 1 (hall
declare mine like a fan of freedom.
People talk to you continually ol
Roland and his -virtuesâl render
him that justice which is due to him,
but 1 think his talents are too much
extolled. If you mean to add refs
your prailes to him, address them
alio to-his wife, for (he also bad a
/hare in the AdminHt ration 1 also
liave been a Minilier, but I aifted
alone, and 1 did eveiy thing alone ;
but if Roland had not had a wife, he
would not have obtained so much
praise. Without doubt, and proofs
of it exilt, he does not pollels that
greatness of character, and that
sublime intrepidity, which are not
intimidated by great dangers. I
will tell you thar, in the lafl mo
ments of the ciifis, he (hewed a
want of firmnefs, and declared in
the Council his intention to quit
Paris." [Thisfpeech was often in
terrupted by loud murmurs.]
Ban ere,in the warmth of the de
bate, improperly applied to Roland
the exprellion of that Athenian,
who being alked, why he voted a
g;iinft Ariltides, replied ? " 1 am
lired of hearing him lliled, The
Just."
Another Member severely cen
sured this application.
Chambon.â" We have been Re
publicans eight days, and yet we
abandon ourselves to all the infatu
ation of slaves. Be on your guard,
1 eit gratitude should hurry you too
far ; excess of giatitnde conducts
always to despotism. Let us not
forget what happened among the
Dutch j one of their fellow-citizens
rendered them great set vices, which
were extolled to the clouds ; they
created b'un Stadtholder ; and this
Stadtholder at length cruflied their
liberty. I move the order of the
day."
Louvt't replied to the reproach
thrown out by Danton against the
Minister of the Home Department,
for having (hewn a want of firinnefs
and courage.â" During the days
of proscription (said he) I waited
upon Roland, for I thought that
those who had endeavored to diretfl
the poignards of aflaflins against
him might at length fee their per
fidious designs crowned with suc
cess. When I saw Roland on that
occasion, he said, â" If lam pro
scribed, I will calmly wait my fate,
Slid i hope that this murder will be
the last."âWas this pusillanimity,
as has been said by Danton ?"
Laluurce.âÂ«â¢ VV itho\ic wailing our
time in enquiring whether the ta
lents ascribed to Roland, were en
tirely his own, or in a great mea
sure those of his wife, 1 am of o
pinion that a public man ought not
to be reproached for having a pru
dent wife, and even for sometimes
following her wife counsels. The
reflection that has been thrown out
by Damon is unwonhy ofa Legisla
tor."
After defending Roland againfl:
all the calumnies that had been
thrown out againfl him, Lafource
moved the previous queltion on all
the motions thatliad been made.
The Convention now palled to
the order of the day.

A rumour is in circulation, but
which we can at present give butas
the report of the day, that the Dqke
of SuderinanLa has declared the
young King of Sweden a baft.vd,
and undertaken to prove his illegi
timacy to the Diet of the kingdom
about to be convoked. The regent
is powerful ; but should the Em
prel3 of Ru(lia prove unfavorable to
his piojec r ts, a civil war mil ft be the
inevitable consequence. It is true
that Rufiia being already so much
en g a g e d in the affairs of Poland and
France, might favour the execution
of so bold and iniquitous a project,
but it is scarcely probable that in
the cafe of such an event, the Duke
would have destroyed Ankarftrom
and his afl'ociates, as men of that
character might have been made ve
ry serviceable in such a caufc.
The conduct of the regent of
Sweden is not unlike the Duke of
Gloncefler, whotofecure the crown
of England, employed the Du'ke of
Buckingham to harangue the citi
zens in Guildhall, touching the le.
giti inacy of Ed ward V.and The Duke
of York. Jt is to be devouily wish
ed, however, that in after ages it
may not be laid of the Duke of Su
dermaniaâ
" This man was noble,
" But with his last attempt he wiped it out
" Deftioy'd his country,andhis name remains
'VTo the ensuing ages abhorr'd."
The rapid decay observable in
the Queen of France, is attributed
to poison, secretly adininiftered by
the Jacobines. The King who lo
ved good eating and drinking as
well as any of his fubjecls, is now
supplied with either in very scanty
portions, instead of his favorite food,
boiled chickens, he mull now be
content wiih a-la-mode beef; and
as to drink, they do not even fur
iiilh him with clean water.

Since the French have raised the
camp of Maulde, where our troops
have destroyed all the works, a
a corps of 10,000 Aullrians have en
camped at Helemme, about half a
league from that place. A number
of troops lately set off" from Tour
nay to polt themselves in the envi
rons of Lille, and that place is block
ed up cloler and cloler. A great
quantity of ammunition and artille
ry has been sent from the Duke of
Saxe-Tel'chen's army ; and it seems
that, notwithstanding the advanced
season of the year, enrerprize will
not be deterred. Lille has been re
inforced with three battalions of
National guards, and has received a
supply of provisions of every kind ;
and every preparation, in fine, is
made for a long refinance. On the
other hand, General JBeaulieu is en
camped with his corps on Mount
d'Aupin, near Valenciennes. On
the 1 }ih a large body of the Hou
lans and Chafleurs advanced under
the walls of that fortrefs, when a
detachment of dragoonsand infant
ry sallied out upon them, a finart
aifiion ensued, in which our troops,
notwithstanding the greatest efforts
of bravery, were obliged to retire
in disorder, with the loss of a good
number killed, besides several ta
ken prisoners. On the 19th of Sept.
from 1200 to 1400 men of the garii
fon of Maubeug made a finart attack
on oar fldvnnccd ports ; at firft
met with a Itrong refinance, but our
troops having received a reinforce

retire to their fortrefs with the loss
of a grear nnmber of men. The

derable."

A report 011 the petition of William Dunbar,

in favor of the prayer of the petition, and pro-
poses that a bill should pass, allowing to the

tim motion was negatived, 24 to Ir.

go daring the late war. A motion to refer this

A memorial of Noah Phelps was read, pray

The petition of E.ilher Johufon was read and
referred to the Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. Murray prei'ented the petition of Wal
ter Smith, lare a junior surgeon in the American
army, praying a settlement and payment of his
account.
Mr. Murray Rated the circumltances on Wfcjch
this application was founded ; but a motion to
refer the petition to a fcle<st committee, was ne
gatived.
Ihe house tool; into consideration the report
of a I*ledt coinmitree on the petition of Moses
*onng. n-c petition anci repuit were read :
the report wa* in favor of the petition. Mr.
\ouhg was appointed Secretary to Mr. Laurens
on his emb ifi'y to Holland. Mr. Laurens, it
appears, had recommended to Mr. Youno- to
take but one naif of his salary, in confederation*
of theembaiTy 'shavingproved inefficient; and,
as an inducement, informed Mr. Young that he
(:/Ir. Laurens) intended to relinquish the whole
of his salary. Mr. Young, from patriotic mo
tives, and influenced by the example of Mr.Lau
rens, accordingly relinquilhed one half of his sa
lary as Secretary uforefaid ; âbut finding after
wards that Mr. Laurens had, on his return to
America, received his full salary and emolu
ment from tne government, as ambaJTador,
Mr. Young, in the petition, prays that he may
be paid tha full amount of the salary he had, on
t.ie aforefaid eofifiderations, relinquilhed.ââ
All the vouchers and documents relating to this
bufineis were read : among others, an account
fettled between the UnitedStatesandMr.Young,
l'he queifcion, therefore, according to the opi
nion given by the gentlemen who Supported the
pehf ;'n 4 was, whether the present government
! ould avail ltfelfofthis settlement made under
t e circumltances already Hated, and thereby
ptedude the petitioner from the full allowance
to wnich he was, by a resolution of the former
Congress, entitled, especially as by the account
t u it appears that Mr. Young made a reser
vation of a further claim.âlt was observed that
t e allegations in the petition were supported by
the most explicit declarations on the part of Mr.
aurem ; and that the petitioner was clearly
an justly entitled to the sum he had relinquilh
ed on a contingency which had not taken place,
out dire&Jy the reverse ; âit was said that it
would belittle short of taking a pettifogging ad
vantage of the petitioner.
In opposition to the report in favour of the
petitioner, it was raid, that the settlement made
the public office appears to have been done
deliberatelyâ and the allowance of the salary of
Â£ -'jo sterling, was made pursuant to certificates
received from Mr.Laurens, as a full salary. It was
Urged, that if the legislature should rip up tranf
.ivilions so long fettled, and do away accounts fi
nally doled with the proper officers, it would
a inctl rhingeroiio precedent inueed. It was
co.ifuntly echoed in thehoufe, that these iettlc
ments were not to bt disturbed; the consequence
it was easy to perccive, would be of the molt
pÂ«- r 4 ilexing nature; there would bÂ£ no end to
the applications which would take place ; ap
p lta
pretentions, it was said, were much more weigh
tyand important than that now under conside
ration. It was further observed, that it does
not appear that Mr. Laurens had deviated from
his agreement with Mr. Young, in fettling his
h count; for though he had received his full sa
lary as ambassador, it plainly appears rhat he
did not receive it merely as a compensation for
iervice.s as such, but hi part as an indemnifi-
m
AYES
'or "urer .crv.cej, and fâ r losses he had
luftamcd, m consequence of being in public em
ployment ; and therefore Mr. Young", on
account of a luppofed viohtiuu of contrj-A on
the part of Mr. Laurens, is not well founded : â
andtfch.es, it was remarked, that Mr. Younir
m the account he has fettled, has no reference m
his note oi reflation, to any fubfequeut claim
on account of any contrast between him and
Mr. Laurens, After a long debate, the cuefti'on
on agreeing to the report of the committee, in
favour of tne petitioner, a 8 above stated, ivas put
and negatived, 27 to 25.
,Â®f r r W T7 Smith moved, that the petition
of Moses Young, with the additional evidence
and documents accompanying the fame, be re
committed to a feleil committee. This, motion
was toft.

A communication was received and read from

In committee of the whole, on the Coasting
bill. Mr. Sedgwick in the chair.âThe bill was
read in paragraphs, by the Chairman.
The committee went thro' the discussion of
the fevera! fe&iona ; they made various amend
ments, which were reported ant! laid on the ta
ble.
Mr. Key, of the committee on the petition of
Woodrop and Joieph Sims, brought in a report,
which was, that the relief prayed for ought to
be granted.
I lie reading of the petition was called for, the
prayer of which is, that they may be released
from the payment of the duties on sundry goods
loft 011 a vo>age from New-York to Philadel
phia.
A motion was made to accept the report of
the committee.
Mr. Goodhue observed, that though he was'
disposed to grant relief in the cafe, yet he saw
no principle oil which it could be doin*;â¢ âhad
tne owners injured a sum fufficient to have co
x-':~ hr.vc â¢ â  -\zd ffcj*
additional loss occalioned by having given bond
for them. He thought that the house ought to
proceed with great caution, as granting relief in
the present cafe would be establishing a precedent
which might be attended with great inconveni
ence and eventual lofg of revenue.
Mr. W, Smith said, that relief had been grant
ed in a former cafe, which perhaps was fmiilar ;
though he did not pcrfe&ly recollc& the cir
cumstances,âand said he wished the law he al
luded to might l)e read. He ftiggefted the pro
priety of receiving the opinion of the Secretary
of the rrcafury, as it was of thegreateft impor
tance that a full investigation of the fubjedfc
ihould take place previous to any decilion.
Mr. Fitzfimons observed that this was an in
dividual cafe; it flood on its own merits; every
member of the House was fully competent to
forming an opinion on it; and he hoped the
House would determine rcfps&ing it for them
feives,
Mr. Fitzfimons then slated the particulars to
shew that this was a cafe of peculiar hardship and
misfortune; and that the lots of the duties to
which the petitioners were exposed, tro&in part
from an excess of official attention on the part
of the Collector of New-York.âAfter some fur
ther remarks by different gentlemen,
The petition and report were referred to a
committee of the whole, for Monday next.
A letter was communicated by the Speaker,
from Mr. Scney, informing the House that by
reason of an appointment in the judiciary in the

and ill every diftrift oi' our country. A u ri
tej- in one of tlie daily papers of this week,
lias given an nncoriiroon turn to his antifede
ralifci. He faysâMr. Adams is a Monarchy
man, Mr. Clinton an Anti. The ca'e is la
mentableâbut one or the other mult beVice
cfident. It leenis as it the drift of the
piece was more to give the people a dreadful
opinion of a geVcrnmeiit w'.irn c rut. he
kept out oi very improper hand , tl. ,Nt; re
commend a favorite candidate K ..t he w indi
up, inconfnleiitly enough, %vitl. ;".ii'ur:â (; us
that the amendments have made Gov. ( ;. ii
a very good fcderaliil â-Such a friend to tie
constitution a: the writer uppears to be, may
ue Utis.'ied with i.ich a lale-mede federalifta*
'Â°v. Clintonâthe fcdcrahjts twill prefer Mr.
Adams.
Shortly to be put 10 the press, a Treatise
clearly deinonlti ating that the advocates for
a government of Kiv.g, Lords a c Commons.
arÂ« ~,>t only the friend*, but the or.ly fricads
to the Conditution of the United States ; and
that every man who ealis himfelf a tcdiratiji,
and yet denies, rhi. portion, is either an iduot
or a hypocriteâ(pjT In an appendix, will Le
a proper comparifbu of the political creeds of
Mr. A. and Gov.C. wherefrom it will appear,
that the fiinple alteration desired by IVL\ A.
from a republican to a morarchcel government,
is much left conÂ£derab|e than t!*e various
amendments infilled on by Gov. C, in relath n
to trhriT Jy jyry, rYe.aoin Oi the \n. .
ltanding armies, &c. &c. which cou'.d uot but
derange and Cisfigure the whole iiru&me i 4
aspect of the l"
'!tem.
Wh'.'e fonie egregious politicians have been
clamouring for a change of meaiures, and pro
pljelving a change of menâit appears rather
more than probable, that they bave calculated
among theni Telvet., without coufnlting the
temper of the peop e, and there tore may ex
pert a double difappointinent-âfor in caies
where re-elections have not taken place, the
ciioice has been of truly federal chara<Rers in
refpetf to new candidates. It may appear to
be absurd to lav that party will clamour with
out a lubjedâbut it is a truth-âThus u emp
ty veiTels make the gieateft found."
A republic is said to be founded on virtue ;
but it we may believe our fault finders, what
ever may be the fouuduiitm, the jnfirjtrvduie of
the American republic conffts of the vilest
materials âAccording to vhefe icimaculate
reformers, nothing can exceed the venality,
avarice and amlitioi: of thole me,; who con
ftitnte the majoiity in the government, and
its administration, through the fuffra.jes ef
the people ; and for aught that appears to the
contrary, wiil enjoy their approbation for
years to come. Eutifit is not patriotic to '
doubt the integrity, ftigmat ze the motives,
and depreciate the abilities of those who pos
sess in an eminent degree, the confidence of
the people, pray what is patriotism J
The enemies of government have pretend
ed that they regard measures ard not men.â
It appears however that one great emjof their
labors was to difpiace the Vice-Prefdentâ
They have said also, arid it was eafer to fay
than for others to believe, that they are fede
ralâtho' they have feribbled againfl every
thing, they are for the couftitution. They
would not mar iiâthey would not break a
twig of the federal tree. Yet, fays stubborn
fac't, they would chiife a man who would have
laid the axe to its root.

If'ESTERN INT ELL IGENCE
RICHMOND, Nov. 26
A gentleman jufl returned from
the fputh western territory, has fa
vored us with the following infor
mation :
_ O" Sunday the 41)1 inft there ar
rived at Knozville eight Indians
from the Cherokee nation ; three of
tl efe were prir.dpai chiefs, viz.
The Standing Turkey, the War
rior's Son of KfhVtlaula, and the
Hanging Maw, from the beloved
town of Ghota. The object of their
Vmrrev was to hold a sulk withGo
-vernor Blount ; to ad'ure him of the
pacific <!ifjwfition of their nation,
and to requeil that they may befuf
iered to iiunt without niolellation.
On Saturday the tenth, thty were
lafely ctindutfed to the bank of the
river, opposite to the town of Coy
â¢ties, 011 their veinrff home, bv Ma
jor George Fmrogood, and a party
of gentlemen.
i lie Btiva party of Indians stole
eight h-orfes from Gamble's flat ion
about 12 miles from KnoxHlle. '
On Friday the ninth, two regi
ments of territorial troops, under
the command of Colonel Landon
Carter and Col. Gilbert Chriltian,
marched from Knoxville, to guard
the iVomie'is, and to build forts and
llations Between the Papo Fold and
the juii(stiou of the Clinch and Te
lle ft e.
To the honour of our weft em bre
thren, let it that of
the 1 wo regiments above-mentioned,
(even companies were entirely cÂ»m
pofed of volunteers, armed aiid
equipped at their own (txpeiicÂ£.
On Saturday the lOth, Gefits*al
Sevier pui fired his route from Knox
ville, escorted by a troop of horfif,
raised in Greene county, and com
manded by captain Jamej Richard
son, to take the command of the
frontier army, now amounting to
from twelve to fifteen hurfdi ed men.
Our informant mentions, that this
troop of horse, though
embodied, were at leaflf *iqual in
inajply and martial appearance, as
well as in their uniform,'hel"fes,and
other equipments, to any corps of
horse he ever law in the regular
continental or European armies.
On Monday the 12th, the hoofe
of lihenezer By rain,on Heaver creek,
(a branch os-Clinch) seven miles
from Knoxvirfc, was attacked in the
morning, about sunrise, by a party
of fifteen Cherokee Indites. Thev
beat in the window with (.heir roros
hawks, and presented two
but before they could observe their
destined vi&ims, Mr.. Byrstni and
Mr. Jefferies, the only two men in
the house, fired at the two Indians
who appeared at the window, when
they both fell, and the Indian party
immediately fled.
The gallant defenders of their
houfhold gods, then went out and
found one of the Indians dead, whoÂ«(
theyfcalped ; they afterwards track
ed the fugitives about two miles, fy
the blood of their woanded compa
nionâhere they found a confidcrt
ble quantity of blood,*fome human
flefh and splinterS of bones j at this
fpoi thej ftippofed the wounded In
dian expired, aud was carried off
by his aftbeiates, as the bloody Â«Â£ck
was no longer vifibje,
Thus the cGol bravery of two re
foluce men not only saved their
own lives, but preserved a number
of women and children, who were
at the time in the haufe, from th#
butchering cruellies of these re
niorfeJefs savages. It deserves to
be noticed, that Mr. Byram is up
wards of sixty years of age.
. Notwithftandingthe contiguity of
these depredations to tho feat of ter
ritorial government, the inhabitants
feeni as unapprehensive of danger
as the citizensof Richmond are, and
it was with difficulty that Governor
Blount, who lives in a retired house,
about a mile froin Knoxville, could
be prevailed on to accept of a
guard, which he limited to fix men.
The gentleman who has obliged
us with the above inre!]ig?nrr, hÂ«s
brought to this city the lcalp of the
Indian killed in the attack on Mr.
Byram's house.
By the custom-house return from
Bermuda Hundred, it appears that
the total amount of the merchan
dise imported and entered there
from the firft of July to the thirti
eth of September la(fr, is 824,592 dol
lais and cents.âAnd the amount
of goods exported duritlg the fame
peiiod, is 526,280 dollars and 04
tents.
Yeflerday morning died, John
Fleming, in cor.sequence of a wound
in the head, which he received from
Kemp, a few evenings iince ;
ihe ablconded, but we
are informed, that diligent featch
is now making afrer him.

Perhaps there no science more entertaining
and u'eful than geography. It reveals the disco
veries of travellersâthe remai kablc cui iofities of
ai! in nature and artâthe fttuaiion ol
provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, & moun
tains in fine, the hiltory, manners, cuftotns, laws,
fotces, revenues, and government of different na
tions.
It is an Old ohfervation, that " there is not a
foil or of Adam, but has some concern
with %'cogi3jjÂ»hy and that a knowledge of this
fcicnce is indlfpcnfable towards the study of his
tory with advantage or fatisfaflion. Indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannot discourse an the
njoft common newspaper topics of the day without
betiaymg Ins ignorance.
So much lor geography generally. With rc
fpc6t to the prcfent plan, let it luffice to remark,
that GuUÂ»rie's Geography lia.s been long acknow
ledged to be the bÂ«ft in the Englilh language ;
however, the account ot America in it has, from
obvious rcafoÃi, been very erroneous and defec
tive. The er.ors of former editions will be cor
:'Cfcled,ond the defects supplied, by gentlemen of
abtbun, who iiave enjaged to fuperiniend this
and io avmi thcmfclves of all the in
orniation that can be procured, to rÂ«nder it the
inÂ«.H complete edition exuut.
The Primer earneftlv folicjts the support of his
k llow-cttizi ns throughout the United Stales : and
fÂ»Â« no dcpout is required, and every fubfcriher will
beat .tuerty to withdraw his name,, if, on trial,
he lliocld, disapprove of the work, he hopes the
ritntls of faience. and of American arts and raa
nufjftures, will cheerfully and eai ly patronize this
ufefnl work, the grritcft and most expensive, pro
