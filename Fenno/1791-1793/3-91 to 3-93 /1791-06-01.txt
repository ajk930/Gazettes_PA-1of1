ANECDOTE.
WHEN King John was shewn where a noble
man, that had rebellioufly borne arms
against hiin, lay very honorably entombed, and
was ndvifed to defacc the monumcnr, he saidâ
" No, no ; but I would all the reft of mine cne
i.iies were as honorably baried."from the DUBLIN CHRONICLK, oj the sth Aran,.
l\lr. Burke's speech on the Minister's proportion to
encrcafe the naval armament.
MR. Burke rose, as he f<iid, to make a few ob
servations upon what he considered the molt
extraordinary event that had palled in that Houle
(ince he had the honor to fit in it. He oblei ved,
that he could not account for the measure when
he considered the talents of the right hon.
gentlemen, which for one he had been ready
often to acknowledge. In tlie part he fliould
take, or in the opposition he fliould give to this
uncommon itep of Minilters, he difclaimcd all
party confederations whatever. If any acrimony
ugaiiiit anyone person ar anytime found its way
into him, he declared that whenever he difcuf
led anv public or constitutional question it was
neutralized and even dulcified. This was exactly
the cafe at present; he said that he had never heard
of such moderation as the right hon. gentleman
had set up â , it was in his opinion a crueltyâit
was telling the Ruffians that they might have
continued the war, and though aggrefled, and ofÂ«
course entitled to revenge themselves 011 the
aggrefl'ors, yet that they mult relinquilh tlie con
quells they fliould make, and be content to be put
on their former footing. Thus the uti poffidetis
was to be held before them.âBut the uncommon
part in what he beheld of Minillers, was the in
cluding Tu key in the balance of Europe. It
had been coafidered an Asiatic country, and
ought so to be held without in any degree strik
ing the eye in its attention to the European ba
lance of power. Had it any Ambaflador at our
Court, at Berlin, or at Copenhagen, &c. ? Did
it pay any regard to us, or consider us ill any
other light than as heretics ? Was not our Am
baflador there treated like a dog ' " For my part
((ays Mr. Burke) my way of reasoning may be
considered as upon the old principle ; but 1 very
much dislike this a?iti-crufade. I am not for fa
voringfuch barbarians, and oppressing Chriflians,
to the detriment of civilization and hindrance
of human refinement."â" Why (said he) are
we to be alarmed at the Ruffians' capture of a
town ?âthe empire of Turkey is not difmember
cd by that. We are in podeifion of Gibraltar
and yet Spain is not difniembered " â In refpe<!t
to confidence, it was not capable of definitionâ
much of it must be left to discretion. He was
ready to allow that " a Minister without any
confidence would be no better than a (lave ; and
if too much confidence were implicitly reposed
5n him," said he " we fliould be slaves ourselves."
He could not fee the fmallelt reason for our
alarms at the aggrandisement of Russia, or fears
for the depression of Turkey. The right hon.
gentleman might call this by the name of Mode
ration : but would it be deemed so by the world ?
Was it not an iufult to every other power ? Was
it neceflary, in order to pi eferve the balance, that
every State or Power fliould continue exactly in
the fame state ? or could that balance be afFeOted
by the loss of Oczakow to the Turks ? It was fine
talking of what we are to do wiih Russia by a
naval armament. "We were to conquer Ame
rica," said Mr. Burke, " and I gave my opinion
what would be the fruits of the attempt." Mr.
Burke concluded a inofl: eloquent speech, by ob
fei ving, that if these interferences are to take
place at any time by the haughty and atTuning
Minillers of any Srate, they ought to be in fa
vor of freedom and the cultivation of Chrijlian
fellowfliip, and not in efpotifing the cause of
Barbarians who have not the fmallelt regard for
lis in return.
Sir Jnmes Murray said a few words after Mr.
Burk upon the fame fide, when the question was
loudly called for, and the gallery ordered to be
cleared. The House now dividedâ

From the GENERAL ADVERTISER,
Mr. BaChe,
THE influence of the prcfentconftitution of the United States
extends not only to the situation, but also to the language of
America. The republican principles of the government, instilled
into the majority of the citizens, have given rife to the employ
ment of the word federal, as a recommendatory epithet. We
have federal beer, federal cakes, federal manufactories, and along
lift of federal etcetera. Pafling through a certain part of th's me
tropolis, I was fttuck with a new application of the word : On a
Schoolmaster's flgn was written, " Readiug, Writing, Arithmetic,
&c. taught upon a federal fvftem." I >vas at firft diverted with
this idea of honest Quit; '>ut began afterwards to consider that
there was more reaf 11 in his use ot the word federal than I was
aware of. Our modern Schools ate called places of education : â
We are, it is true, inftt u&ed there in languages and sciences ; but
whence do we get our other knowledge ? Not in Universities. â
Our religious sentiments are inherited from our parents; our mo
rals are acquired from our companions ; our ideas of government
are the consequences ot early prejudices in favor of the constitution
of our native land,raiher than rational principles adopted by rea
son from a knowledge and of the government of
other countries. But, were thefc made part of the instruction of
our youth in public Seminaries ;* were young persons taught to
* [The ingenious and philanthropic Noah Webster, anticipat
ing the idea of the above writer, some time ago publijhed a Federal Ca
techism for the use oj Schools. J
think for themftlvcs; wÂ»re they rationally mftruaed in the g -
tious principles of equalUblrtr, were they impressed with an ear
ly sense of their religious and social duties, we [hould not then
have much reason to complain of the degeneracy of mankind ; we
(hould have better and more enlightened members of foc.ety-men
fit to be CUIUS of a republic. Such an education would inreality
be upon a FEDERAL SYSTEM.

ITTEN ON LEAVING TH K PLACE OF MY NATIVITY.
HIGH up thr heaven* the Sun in radiance moves,
Gilding thy varied beauties, happy Tlactr,
Whofi charms, by birth and time endear'd, my fpint loves,
And mourning leaves, a distant way to trace.
Now let me check the rising sigh
To mark, with melancholy eye,
Thy feenes which, lingering, from my view retire :
Thy domes, flow-moving from the fight;
Thy Lake, which gleams a fainting light;
Thy dim-difcovcred spire.
Dear scenes of youthful joyâfarewel !
Farewel the Street which evening hail'd her own,
Charm'd with the scattered moonlight o'er it thrown,
Listening, with sweet attention, while the
Rung o'er the echoing fields, of Summer's early bell.
Farew?l the Street, where winter, robed in snow,
Roar'd with wild tempest in the ear of night ;
Where Fritndfhpip, powerful, could his might o'erthrow,
And win Affection's house of calm delight.
Farewel thou venerable Dome,
Where the mild Sabbath call'd ray constant feet.
Still let me think how frequent on thy feat,
Decp-mufing tho't hath found a heavenly home.
For there the souk when bigot rage was raised,
And fiery zeal threw criinfon o'er the face,
Or when the vengeance of the Lord was praised*
And torture (hook the tenements of grace ;
Or priestly wdrmth upraised the rod ;
Or Dullness nodded o'er the word of God ;
Could look with mild complaeenc.y around ;
And aye where inborn worth was found,
Or goodness glow'd upon the face of youth,
Or native innocerty shone,
Or beauty foften'd on the lip of truth,
Or dove-like Purtnef&fix'd her throne ;
Could gaze with fond delight,
Grow better atthe fight,
Grateful would fvell for what was given,
And rife, in glowing rapture, up to heaven.
To the still-winding River's moonlight banks ;
The slowly-rising //;//, which leads along
To where the Grove t rich scene of Quips and Cranks
And side-supporting laughter, becks the jocund throng ;
One pensive, last farewell, now loads my sorrowing song.
Farewel dear Inmates of my foul!
Now let no grief your minds controul ;
Now heave no silent, secret, sigh ;
Or hang in tears th mournful rye ;
Or lift the hands, in angaifh wrung ;
Or wake to speech the flattering tongue.
Is't not enough in pain to part ?
Spare, spare, the agpuizing heart.
Science hails mc to 4 Ker feat ;
Bright Ambition urges on ;
Fame to Glory tempts my feet.
* Seize on knowledge ere 'tis gone.
' Learning opes her varied stores ;
* Age his ft ream o f treasure pours;
* Meek-eyed Piety requires;
Â« Mild Humanity desires ;
Â« Pity points, thy gain, the flues ;
1 Come !' the Voice of Nature cries.
Father of Heaven ! I bow with foul refign'd.
My former joys (hall aid my better part;
All meaner cares be banifn'd from my mind
My toils my Country claims, and God my heart.

TO THK PUBLIC.
OX" the frtUrtcehth of January last the fubferiber presented a
memorial to Congress, dating his intention to publish a
complete and correct octavo edition of the Law% Resolutions, and
Treaties of tke United States, and praying that Curb mcafurc&
might be adopted as would give authenticity to i - id edition.
The memorial was read in the House of Reprefen: stives, and re
ferred to the Secretary of State, On the ieventh of February that
officer, after matwre deliberation made the FoP.owiag report : â
" The Secretary of State, to whom was referred the memorial
of Andrew Brown, printer, of Philadelphia, has had the lame un
der his consideration, and thereupon makes the following
Report,
The Mcmorialift states that he has in contemplation to publiffi
a corrcft edition of the Laws, Treaties, and Refactions of the
United States, and prays, that such meahires may be adopted for
giving a public authentication to his woi k, as may euTurtf its re
ception throughout the United States-
The Secretary of State observes, that there exists, at prcfent, but
a Tingle edition of the laws of the Cnitcd Stares, to wit, the one
printed by Childs and Swaine; that this edition is authentic,, the
proof-Pneets thereof having been carefully collated by sworn
clerks, with the original rolls in his office, and rendered literally
conformable therewith. That the firft volume ol this edition can
now rarely be found, the copies originally printed being inoftly
disposed of.
That it is desirable that copies of the laws fliould be so multi
plied throughout the states, and in such cheap forms, as that every
citizen of the United States may be able to procure them. That
It is important also, that such publications be rendered authentic,
by a collation df the proof-fheets with the original rolls, by sworn
clerks, when they are printed at the feat of government, or in its
neighbourhood, and by a collation of the whole work when print
ed at a distance, and a certified correttion of its typogrophical er
rors annexed to each volume.
That this, however, if done at the public expense, would occa
sion an inconvenient augmentation of the number of clerks, as the
ast of collation requires the presence of three clerk?, one to hold
the roll, a fecortd a printed copy jalready authenticated, and the
third the proof sheet.
That it would be more reasonable that persons of confidence
should be employed, at the expence of the Editor, to be named
and sworn as clerks, for the Tpecial occasion.
That, in this way, he is of opinion that it will be advantageous
to the public to.permit that the Laws, to be printed by the Memo
rialist, be collated with, and corredled by, the original rolls, and
that a certificate thereof, by the Secietary of State, be annexed to
the Edition.
THOMAS JEFFERSON, Secietary of State.
February 5, 1789."
Iq consequence of this report, Congress have adopted the fol
lowing resolveâ
" RESOLVED by the Senate and Hous f. of Represent a
ti ves of the United States of America in Congress aflembled,
That Andrew Brown, or any other printer, be permitted, under
the dire&ion of the Secretary of State, to collate with, and correct
by, the original rolls, the Laws, Resolutions and Treaties of the
United States, to be by him printed. And that a certificate of
their having been so collated and corretted be annexed to the fa?d
Edition. Provided, That such collation and correÂ£tion beat the
expense of the said Andrew Brown, or such other printer, and
that the person or per Tons to be by him or them employed in that
service, be approved by the Secretary of State.

As this Edition of the statutes of the united states is
to. be printed at the feat of gov rnment, and with the approbation
of Congress, and as the proof-(heets shall be collated with the
original rolls and records, by ("worn clerks, in the office of the
Secretary of State, there caii be no doubt but it will meet with a
candid and universal reception.

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those wl.o are acquainted with the town
nnd harbour of New-Haven; tr> those who are not, fufftcc it to fay,
'hat its beautiful situation is no: furpaflcd, if equalled by any; be
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by realon of the flats, this vharf is neccffarily extended to the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the moll extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about Â£-4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile intereil of New-HaÂ»en and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime intereftof all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all daffcs of people, for
the success of this enterprize, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet publiQied in
America) induce the managers to believe the tickets wiJl meet with
a fpcedy falc.
The drawing will positively commence at the Stnte-Koufe, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A 1 ift of the fortunate numbers will be publilhed, and the prizes

nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
for the ufc ot the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.
