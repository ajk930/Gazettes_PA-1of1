A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 69, HIGH-STRF.F.t ?HII. ADELPHIA
[No. 79, of Vol. lII.]
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
The SECRETARY of the TREASURY, ,n obedience to the order of
the Houfeof Reprrfentatwa oj the 19 th injltnt, reflecljully makes
the following
REPORT.
AT the close of the year 1790, there was a confiderab.e tui
plus of revenue beyond the objects of expenditure, which
had required a provision to that period ; which surplus, bv ar,
act of me 1 ath of August in that year, was appropriated to the re
du&ion of the public debt. n
The lUiement (A) herewith submitted will shew, 111 one view,
,11 the sums which according to the eilablifhments heretofore
made, and correfpondmg appropriation., have requ.r d and will
require to be defrayed, from the beginning of the year ,791, to
the end of the year 1792, amounting together to seven millions
and eighty-two thousand, one hundred and ninety .seven dollars,
and seventy-sour cents.
The statement (B) will also frew in one view the nett product
of all the public revenues for the fame period, according to the
Left calculation and estimate which can now be formed ot it, a
mountingto seven millions and twenty-nine thousand seven hun
dred and fifty-five dollars, and twenty-fix rents.
The statement (C) exhibits a summary of the total annual ex
penditure of the United Slates, in conformity to existing eftablilh
ments, amounting to three millions fix hundred and eighty-eight
thoufaud and forty-three dollars, fifty cents.
The statement (B) includes a view of the probable product during
ihe year 1792, ot the eXisting revenues of the United Slates, a
moonting to three millions seven hundred thousand dollars.
From thefeftatements will refuh substantially the information
which is desired by the House of Rcprefentatives, as far as it is
now in the power of the Secretary to give it.
One or two matters however may be proper to be added with
a view to greater accuracy..
There are certain instances, in which the estimates for appro
priations have exceeded, and will exceed the sums actually ex
pended. Hence, the apparent excess ot the expenditure as ex
hibited in the statement (A) beyond the product ok the revenue as
ihewo in the statement (B) will probably not be found real. But
the amount ot these furpluffs or over estimates is not stated, be
cause it is not, and in some cases, cannot now be ascertained, and
it is not likely to he very confidcrable; and becaufe,alfo if it fhouid
do more than counterbalance the excess alluded to, it will be fafeft
to set off the surplus agaiuft those contingent demands which from
time to time occur.
No deduflion has been made from the annual interest, on ac
count of the debt purchdfed. This has proceeded trom a fuppo-
Tition that it will be deemed expedient by the legislature, to appro
priate inviolably the interest of any part of the debt which (hall
at any time be exiinguifhed, towards the extin&iori of the re
mainder. This point will be more particularly fubinitied in a
report on the fubjetfc of the public debt.
All which is humbly fubinitted,
ALEXANDER HAMILTON,
, Secretary ot the Treasury.

ports for the entire period ; yet so many have been received (in-
the principal ports) as to have admitted ot a calculation
with regard to the left, not liable to material error. The pio
â¢ luce for the year 1790, has served as a guide, in refpeÂ£l to ports
Irom which returns have not beeit received.
(B) The sum here Hated, is altogether upon estimate : the tun
which has elapled ftnee the end of the quarter not admitting ol
the proper documents. It exceeds the producc of the fame qua
â  er, for the preceding year, fifty-five thouland seven hundred
seventy-three dollars and pineteen centi? If the ratio of lncreaf
of any preceding quartet during the year J791, had been appned
to this quarter, the fuin would have been considerably greater
But it is believed, that this would not lurnifh a just rule. It:s
understood that the importations for the last quarter of 1790, were
much eucreaftd to avoid the additional duties which were to
tak â¢ place on the firft day of the year 1791. And though the ad
ditional duty on dittilled spirits, might at fiift view lie ex petted
to add to the product for the quarter in question, yet it is ar
lrom certain, that tins was the ettett of it. E- â¢ Quinary e * er "
tions were made to import distilled spirits prior to J u y* w en
the additional duty took, effect, which may be luppoled to have
l-ffened the quantity afterwards-fo as to leave it a question whe
ther this article was more or less produflive in that quarter, t an
in the fame quarter of the former year. Making allowance for
these ciicumftances. it does not appear probable, that the lalt
! quarter of ,7gi, Willi xceed the last quarter of 1790, in lo great
a proportion, as anv of the preceding correfpondmg quarters.
(C) This sum is materially (Wtof the originally estimated pro
duct,but from the returns hitherto received, it does not appear like
ly to be greater. This is owing partly to a decreased distillation of
spirits from ioreign materials, in consequence of a ludden rile in
the price of molatfes, and partlv to the obstacles which have re
tarded the complete execution of the law.
' D) The sum here estimated, cannot, in the natiire of the thing,
be accurate. It includes a compromise of oppofiie considerations.
First, it contemplates an additional sum for the additional duty
on imported spirits, which will be fully operative during the
present year. Secondly, it contemplates the poflibility thatine
disturbances in Hifpaniola may tend to diminifti thelupply of (e
---veral articles which areobje&sof considerable duties, and may
proportionally diminish ihe revenue. Hence about one third ol
the probable increase of the duties on spirits is added to the pro.
ducc of the year 179*1 and the aggregate is taken as the produce
of the year 1792 abatingtwo thirds of lhat increase as an eqvivaÂ»-
Knt for other deficiencus.
(E) The fame disturbances in Hifpaniola may be expetted to
diminish the produtt of the duties on home made spirits, by con
fiderahly reducing the supply of molaftes ; which, added to the
obftaclefc already alluded to (and which it will require yet some
rime completely to furmouni)cannot fail to render the real pro
duÂ£l of these duties, in the eourfe of the prelent year, materially
less than the estimated produd. Accordingly an abatement of
about one-third is made in the present eftimaie.

Jequence of appropriations mace by law ; and a regular ftaiement
and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public

Oft. 2t. Notwithstanding theprefent apparent
public peace and tranquility, it is visible that no
fniall uneasiness exists relative to the very consi
derable emigrations that have taken place these
some weeks pad:. It is a matter of serious con
cern also to lee such quantities of cafli every day
transferred into foreign countries, which ought,
in justice, to remain in the kingdom.âThere is
no doubt of the reality of the preparations mak
ing by the French ex-princes ; and however dis
couraging their profpecfis may seem, they are by
no means dertitute of powerful friends. The
pafl'ages leading to the French frontiers, are as
much thronged by people, night and day, as the
road between Paris and Versailles. The French
inhabitants on the frontier provinces are ex
tremely exasperated against the fugitives, and
have unanimously declared, that upon the firft
authentic news of an invasion, they will imme
diately burn and destroy the buildings and pof
femons of the old nobility, and will give 110 quar
ter to any person whatever, who is found in
arms, and in favor of restoring the old govern
ment. It is certain, that if a civil war does break
out (and as f&r asdepends on the emigrants, that
will certainly be the cafe) it will be one of the
tnott bloody that has ever happened in the an
nals of mankind.
00. 28. Notwnhftanding the very confidera
blenumber of French officers that are reported
to have deferred their ports on the frontiers,
(feme fay 30 or 40 thousand) it is proved that
these accounts are exaggerated. A letter from
the minister of war to the National Membly
ffates the matter as follows. The total number
of officers in the French is from ten to eleven
thousand, from which have deserted not more
than two thousand, exclusive of the body-guards
of the king and princes, which are fomethino
fliort of 1400 ; and perhaps eight or nine hun
dred more from the old reformed corps â  so that
the whole number of deserters is between four
and five thousand ; who have referred to the fe
veral rendezvous of the ex-princes.â It is certain
tha; the number of soldiers that have deserted
to the party of the princes is not near so consi
derable as that of the officers, and confiderine
the obstacles that the German princes have
thrown in the way of recruiting for the French
princes, if does not seem probable that they will
ever be in a condition to invade France with any
profpecl 01 success.

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF RF. PRESEN TA TIVE S,
THURSDAY, January 5, 1791.
The Houje proceeded in the consideration of the
Pofl-Office Bill.
TV/TR. FITZSIMONS' proportion for authorif
>ng the (tages vvhicli transport the mail to
carry palfengersâwas further difcufTed.
Mr. Clark objected to the propositionâhe tho't
it would give rile to a contest between the (late
and general governments, which he conceived
was unneceflary, and had better be avoided.
Mr. Seney also objected to itâhe said, before
such a clause was agreed to, it certainly was in
cumbent on the gentlemen in favor of it, to (hew
that the regulations in the several states which
would be affedted by it, had, or would obflrutfi
the transportation of the mailâexcept this was
made to appear, it ought to be well confidcred
how far the interference with those privileges
would tend to dilturb the tranquility of the go
vernment.
Mr. Livermore said he had no dotibts on this
fubje<slâ the right of Congress to fend the mail
in that way which will jbe nvoft for the public
advantage, cannot be controverted.âLet gentle
fen, said he, consider what would be the conse
quence, if fiinilar monopolies existed in all the
other statesâit would entirely render nugatory
the power of Congress to eftablifli poft-offices
and post-roadsâ The consequences of this areea
fily to be conceivedâlt is said, that the persons
vested with these exclusive privileges, have con
tracked on as ealy terms as the post-master gene
ral could have contracted with any other per
sonsâbut it does not folldw that they will not
extort in futureâit certainly destroys all compe
tition, and leaves ths United States entirely in
the power of these perfong. He hoped that the
House would not hesitate to adopt the proposi
tion.
Mr. Seney replied to Mr. Livermore, in a few
remarks, in which he juftified the states of Ma
jyland and Virginia for granting the monopolies
in quefhon. r
_ Mr. Gerry said he was in favor of the proposi
tionâHe aiferted that the power to eftablifli poft
roads was coeval with that of eftablilhing poft
ofhces; if the former power is not in Congress,
t ey have already proceeded too far in exercising
the latter power It has been faid,.that the states
had a right to grant these monopoliesâto this
l.e conceded, that they had, previous to the a
doprion of the conftnution ; but in consequence
of that event, all fnch laws are null and void of
courfe.âlt is become necefTary for Congress to
carry their power in this refpetl into execution
tor he had been informed from good authority,

Mr. Barnwell said he had no doubt of the cot*
uitutionahty of jhe propoficionâbut he was of
opinion the prefenr was not thÂ«r most eligi
ble time to exercise the power.âStill he was of
opinion that Congress ought now to declare that
it would exercise it at the expiration of the con
tracts which at present exist between particular
states and individuals, and he moved a proviso
to that efFeift.
Mr. Lawrance was in fentimentwithMr.Barn
well, and seconded his motion for adding a pro
viso, as above.
Mr. Clark objeded to the provisoâit was le
gislating on a fubjet'i wliich the House was en
tirely ignorant ofâwe do not know how long
those contracts are to exist ; why should we then
interfere in a business which we ought not to
do any thing about.âWe may fee aside the Jaw,
or the state may abrogate it, but in either cafe,
the proprietors would be entitled to a full in
demnification. bis part, he thought the
House was getting into a mazeâthe bill has long
been under consideration, and we feeni tn make
no progress. I could wish, said he, 'that the
whole bill was buried, and that we might hear
no more of poft-offices and port-roads.
r - Venable controverted the conflitutionali
ty of an interference on the part ps Congress in
> efpeifi ro these monopoliesâHe observed that
the conftiturion was totally silent on the fubjedt
of paflengers, it limply relates to the tranfporta.
tion of leftersâAnd he conceived that the ope
lation of the proposition, would be to create mo
nopolies on the part of the United States.
I It was here contended that the proviso was
not in orderâThe Speaker said it was not in or
derâan appeal was then made to the House,
which voted that the proviso was in orderâand
was then dif'cuffed.]
Mr. Wadfworth (aid he was opposed to both
the clause and the proviso, he conceived there
was no occasion for eitherâThe (late of Con-
necticut has granted exclusive privileges to run
stages in that Hateâbut has referred to ilfelf the
poxvei to annihilate those contracts at pleaftire ;
ai.d whenever the genera] government (hall make
pt ovifion for transporting the mai 1 on those roads,
those exclusive privileges will ceaseâand be did
not know but that this was the cafe in other
flares.
Mr. Livermore said the proviso was the mod:
extraordinary he had ever heard in his lifeâ
we in the fir(t place in efFe<si abrogate certain
laws of particular Hates, and then by a proviso,
confirm those very laws.
Mr. Lawrance contended, that however extra
ordinary the proviso may appear to be, it was
ftridtlv properâContracts are not be violated â
once formed, they are sacred-âthe dates had a
right to form those contraifls, and to grant those
privileges, and therefore the persons enjoying
thole advantages, cannot be deprived of them â
and though the general government has un
doubtedly a right to take the moll eligible me
thods for the transportation of the mail, yet the
rights of these people ought not to be violated.Mr. Gerry opposed the provisoâHe said it not
only recognised the right of the refpe&ive dates
to pass such laws, as the firft pare of the clause
intends to abrogate, not only before, but subse
quent to the adoption of the constitution, which
he conceived involved an absurdityâOn the ge
neral subject, he observed, thatthefe monopolies
were a tax, not only on the citizens of other
Hates, but of every state in the unionâHe con
ceived that no state poflefies any such power as
that of taxing the people of the United States.
Mr. Benfon remarked, thar the proviso was
improper and unneceflaryâShould any conse
quences result from agreeing to the fir ft pare of
the clause, they will arise between the individu
al claiming the privileges and the state which
granted them, and mull be fettled by a judicial
decision.
Mr. Sturges laid he flioukl vote in favor of the
provisoâthough he conceived that Congress had
a right to make such a law, as would in its ope
ration entirely fnpercede these contracts.
Mr. Findley said he was opposed to the provi
ftj., because it was legislating on improper princi
ples, or rather no principles whatever; for we
know nothing about those contrails.
On the question being put, theprovifo andpro
pofition were bnrh disagreed to.

After communicating their refpecftive powers,
and conferring on the neceflity of another Bank,

Extract of a letter from Boflofi, Jan. 18.
" Our Legislature are now in sessionâ but the
indisposition of the Governor prevents him from
submitting his communications, and they do not
seem disposed to carve for themselves. Their
attention will be much occupied by Boston af
fairsâFirft, the Theatreâthe repeal of the law
against which, is wilhed for by near five to one
of the inhabitants. On this fubjedl, Dr. J
has come forward like a manâand at the town
meeting, drowned liis opponents in a flood of
oratory. are, however, many who oppose
the repeal ;âmany of the Clergy have signed the
petition against the Theatreâsome have lince
erased their names. I think their interference
is injudicious, and will much hurt their influ
ence, since the town, at two legal meetings, was
decidedly for the repeal. My conjeiflui es are,
however, that the law will not be repealed.
" The Bridges will also engage legislative at
tention. Allured by the desire of gain, and
prompted, perhaps, by chagrin, the party which
was the rival of the present Bridge, in the fiilt
application, have come forward with a petition
for a new BridgeâBut a few of them engrofled
all the sharesâThis induced some who were dis
appointed, to open a new fubfeription, which
filled up in a few hours. These rival patties
have their refpetftive friends in both Houses.â
The Tontine will be opposedâbut 1 guess will,
in the end, be incorporated.
" The loss of the brave officers and men who
fell in the Western Expedition, is universally la
mented in this townâlt is the theme of every
conversation, from the infantto the aged fire and
matron, On this town, the loss was severeâ
Phelon, Newman, Warren, Balch and Cobb, may
be said to be citizens of it ; their circle of ac
quaintance was very large, and they were highly
refpecfied by all who knew them. Delighted
with the profpedt of an honorable career in a
military life, they seemed to have acquired the
heighth of their wifliesâand to be plucked thus
early, by a foe, unworthy the valour and intre
pidity, which was their bane, is an event which
fills our hearts with sorrowâand hard indeed
mult be our consolation, when it is derived from
the consideration, that killed outright, they did
not fuffer the torturing cruelties of the savages."
(omitted IN OUR. LAST FOR WANT OF ROOM.]
Observations have lately been published to
(hew, that there is a difference of opinion on
the fubjecft of manufactures, between the Se
cretary of State, and the Secretary of theTrea
fury. To prove this, recourse is had to a passage
in Mr. Jefferfon's " Notes on Virginia," in which
he has laid " Jet our work-shops remain in Eu
rope, &c. this work was published several years
ago âand a correspondent remarks, that it may
as well be inferred, that Dr. Franklin was op
posed ro the Constitution of the United States,
because he had been at a remote periodâthe au
thor of a very different scheme of government,
as that the Secretary of btate is opposed to ma
nufactures, in the present eligible ftuation of our
country, because at a less auspicious period, he
said fomethingto that purpose. The Secretary of
State is a great friend and patron to the mechan
ic artsâbut these arts derive their value and im
portance principally from their applicability to
manufactures.

YOU will fee that the new Legislature verify
the character which I anticipated. The
difcuflion of yesterday, 011 the verification of their
powers, dil'played their democratic features, for
every one of the contelled elections were decid
ed in favor of the known friends of that party.
The cafe of the Abbe Fauchet was very llrongâ
and perhaps a principle (a bad principle 1 allow)
was facrificed in his favor. Bot though they
have so much of this tendency, I do not appre
hend that they will trench on the monarchy,fur
ther than by loading the civil lift with more of
the public expences than now belong to it. This
civil lift is a dreadful fubjetft of alarm to the pa
triots, who affecfl to fee in it the utter ruin of
the constitution. Englilhmen will finile when
they are told, that this tremendous civil lift is no
more than 1,250,0001. sterling, out of which his
Majesty has to maintain 1800-Guards, besides to
keep up an immense houfliold.
This morning the scrutiny for a President and
Secretaries is not yet over, but it is believed that
the virtuous writer M. Paftoret, will be the firft
eletfted President. It is a tribute justly due to
his talents and patriotism. The ballot lies be
tween him and M. Garancoulon.
You may easily conceive that the appearance
of the Aflembly on the firft day was truly inter
esting. An entire new set of men, whose faces
were unknown, coming all at once to replace
the other, was a lingular and unprecedented cir
cumstanceâand it was rendered more so by the
accident, that the several men who, but the day
before had been the leading atfiors in deciding
on the fate of the empire, were, in their renew
ed character of simple citizens, placed as centi
nels at the doors of the Aflembly which they had
been accustomed to agitate and influence.âM.
Dander, in particular, who had been the chief
mover of the Aflembly, and the leader in all
questions, stood ns a Corporal of the National
Guard.
Such is the spirit of that Aflembly which is de
parted, and which will be memorable to the lat
eft period of time ! That Aflembly who demo
lilhed the most powerful delpotifm of Europe
who triumphed over the ancient opinions, and
the most inveterate prejudices of menâover the
power of the king, the nobles and the churchâ
over public force, court intrigue, and ministeri
al corruptionâwho preserved an even tenor a
midst the cabal, the calumny, and the rage of
party withinâthe menaces of all the crowns of
Europe from withoutâand who, having fubfti.
tuted a government of freedom, peace and eco
nomy, in the place of despotism, ambition and
waste, finally pronounced on themselves a sen
tence of diflolution, and returned back to the
humble duties of private life.
Even in this honorable condition they arepur
fued by the fame implacable malice that was e
ver adtive against themâand every wall is cover
ed with insipid placards against them. Their
answer is fliort and fatisfatftoryâ" Read the Con
stitutional a<ft, and judge us by our woiks."

It may be ufeful to remark, that the salaries of all the profefloi j

Such Gentlemen as hold Subsc ri ft ion Paters, he will

by the lad day of November next, and as much sooner as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work has been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highed approbation; both as to the execution of the
printing, its correttuefs, and its cheapness compared with Engliih
copies of the fame size and quality.
As this very laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
ts carried on folelv at his own cost, he is led to hope that all those
who wish to possess a large Family Bible, will so far encouragethu
laudaMe undertaking of their couutiyman, as to add their names
to the fubfeription.
