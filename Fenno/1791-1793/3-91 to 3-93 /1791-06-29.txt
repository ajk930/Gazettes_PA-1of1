REPORT
OF THE
SECRETARY OF STATE,
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE
CQD AND WHALE FISHERIES.
No. XIII.
[con T I N UED.J
THE instances which have proved profitable to the owners are
bul few; greater loffesare to be apprehended from the pre
fer!' high prices of all the n-ceffaries and materials. To clear the
expencc of a voyage, each veflel must at lead bring a return of
fifteen thousand guilders, exclusive of oi.e thousand guilders for
insurance, hefnles the yearly decrease of capital, which tray be
calculated on an average, at thirtv 1 houfand guilders for every
vessel completely equipped, makingthe firm of three million eight
hundred and seventy thousand guilders for one hundred anct
twenty-nine vefle's which have been fitted out this prcfent year,
and which must each fetch out of the Tea twenty ions of net goods
to clcar thcmfclves. The profpeft of doing this is very unfavora
ble, as all onr neighbours life greater exrr lions in that trade than
ever ; to which they are encouraged by the aid of their refpeflive
governments, iri particular the British, who allow forty (hillings
(let ling per ton to cach velTel which is employed in the whale
filheiy ; by which means the number of their whaling veflels have,
since the year 1749, (when 'he bounty was granted) inrreafed from
two to one hundred and nine vessels, which in the spring 1775,
failed from England and Scotland, measuring in the whole thirty
three thousand three hundred and eighteen tons, and amounting,
at forty (hillings per ton, to sixty-six thousand fix hundred and
thirty-fix Dounds, equal to seven hundred and thirty-two thousand
nine hundred and ninety-fix guilders, which amounts upon an
average to fix thousand seven hundred and twenty-five guilders
(or each veflfel.
The fifheries in Sweden and Denmark have also received addi
tional strength from the . ncouragements offered by their govern
ments, without which they would have but little inducement to
'hat trade ; so that intiead of Holland 'ormerly exceeding aII the
o'her nations together in the whale filhcrv, the\ at present exceed
the Dutch by one third in the number of vesselsânay, England
alone now fends out nearly as many vessels as Holland.
Another obstacle orefents itfelf with rejard to the whale-bone
trade. Of this article Holland formerly (hipped five-eighth parts
' Great-Britain, of which sale we are now deprived, on account
ol the high duty imposed on all foreign whale-bone imported in
â¢o that kingdom, and which may be coofidered as ar. additional
premium 011 the fifhery ol that nation, amounting commonly to
fifty guilders per one hundred weight. Our exportation of whale
oil is also on the decline Hamhurgh and Bremen receive great
fnpolies, partly from their own fifheries and partly from England
a d Russia, so as to be able to furnifh thegreareft part of Ger many
with that article. France and Spain ate mostly supplied from
England ; and as it has been alwayi computed, that three-fourth*
the product ot our filheries ate exported, the competition of
those and other rival nations will scarcely leave a foreign market
for us: our own provinces and the liver Rhine, will be our
limits.
Another disadvantage not lo pais unnoticed, which is, that
the prices ot the produce of the filherio are confide,ablv reduced â¢
the whale-hone of the latest vovage having already been foid as low
as ninety guilders or less, which gives a loss. Oil may also, in
cafe of a 'ucce'sful season, nil from fluty to forty guilders per
twelve ftekan (fixtv-three gallons); ai.d in that cafe, vessels that
return With one half or two thirds of their cargo, must (ink money
I hefe are the mod material circinndances that impedethe pro
jrc:- 0! our fiffceric;. The efFcft of the premium granted bv the

!<md fleets, having, iince that period, citcreafed one third in

FROM THE (BOSTON) COLUMBIAN CENTINEL.
MR. RUSSELL,
lIIAVE afi'mned for a principle, that the En
gliHi nation, having delegated all iheir col
lective power, have no right in their original
character, to change their form of government,
unless it has become absolutely inadequate to the
purposes for which it was inllituted. The peo
ple themselves, innll from the necessity of the
cafe be the judges of this facfl; but if in forming
this judgment, and acting in purluance of it,
they proceed from passion and not from princi
ple, if they diflolve their compact from an idea,
that " they have a right to do whatever they
choose," and break the bands of society, in the
forms of defpotifin, " because such is their plea
sure, " tliey may indeed go through the opera
tion by the plenitude of their irrefillable power,
but the nation will meet with ample punifliment,
in their own misery, and the leaders who delude
them, in the detestation of their own posterity.
It is nor by adopting the malignity of a political
fatyrill, by converting the sallies of wit into the
maxims of truth or justice, or by magnifying tri>-
vial imperfections into capital crimes, that a na
tion will bejuftified in resorting to its original
flrength, to contend against its delegated power.
It is not a mechanical horror against the name of
a king, or of ariitocracy, nor a pliyfical antipa
thy to the found of on extravagant title, or to
the fight of an innocent ribband, than can au
thorise a people to lay violent hands 'upon the
conftitntion which prorecls their rights, and
gua'-ds their liberties. They must feel an aiftual
deprivation of their equal rights, and fee an ac
tual impossibility for their reftoiation in anv
other manner, before they can have a right t<*
lay their hands on their swords, and appeal to
Heaven. These are not the principles of slave
ry ; they are the tenets of the only genuine li
berty ; which confifls in a mean equally diftanc
from the delpotifm of an individual, as of a mil'
lion. They are fantftioned by our own uniform
example, and will, I trust, never be departed
from by the molt enlightened, and most virtuous
people on the globe. For fixreen years the peo
ple of America endured a continual fufceffion of
every indignity, which the ppide of dominion,
the insolence of power, and the rapacity of ava
rice, could inflict upon them, before they coultl
resolve to renounce an authority, three tlioufand
miles distant from them ; and even then,' they
were so far from thinking they had a right to
do whatever they chose, that by the very art,
which renounced their connection with Great-
Britain, they exposed to the world their own
f ttfFerings, and the various ac'ts of tyranny, which
had compelled them to " acquiesce in the necef
firy which denounced the Separation," and, " ap
pealed to the Supreme Judge of the world for
the rectitude of their intentions." No, Sir, the
venerable character who drew lip this declara*
tion, never could believe that the rights of a na
tion, have 110 other limits, than its powers.â
Since the revolution, the people of the United
States, have again been compelled to form a na
tional government, and in its forma)ion proceed
ed in the fame spirit. The confederation wa>
found totally incompetent for the purposes for
which it was instituted ; not from an abuse of
the delegated powers, in those by whom it was
adtniniftered, but because Scarcely any powers at
all had been given. The inffieciency of that
fylteni had long been fully demonstrated, and
had reduced us to extreme distress. The States,
United but in name, were upon the verge of ge
neral brnkruptcy. Their crcdit funk to the low

[479842eft ebb, was upon I lie point of expiring, and
iheir exhausted treasury, gave perpetually the
Jie to their public faiih so often and so solemnly
pledged. Tlie forcible ties of a common interelt
direc'ted to one great objedt during the war, were
greatly loosened by the accomplishment of tliat
objetft, and the feeds of mutual hostility were
sown, by the partial commercial regulations ol
the relpeiftive states. The revenue laws which
liad been enac r ted in several of the states, were
not able to support their credit, and yet were so
unequal in their operation,.that numerous bodies
of men in more than one of the states appeared
in open rebellion against the mildelt governments
that ever were instituted. Inflead of the glori
ous reward which the people had expected for
their virtuous exertions, internal discord, and
infamy abroad presented themselves in dreary
perfpetftive before them. At that critical peri
od, when the fyltem to be annihilated, was an
empty name, and there was only a government
to be formed, the national constitution was pre
fented to t lie people of America "in their origi
nal charadler," and even then its existence was
to depend upon the allent of nine states, that is
two thirds of the people. Very fortunately it
has at length been freely adopted by all the
members of the union ; but the extreme difficul
ty which impeded the progress of its adoption,
and the various amendments, which in many of
the states were in a manner made the condition
of their assent, exhibit the fulled evidence, what
a more than Herculean talk it is, to unite the opi
nions of a free people upon any system of govern
ment whatever.
Under the fantftion of fucli authority, I ven
ture to a flirt that the people of England have no
right to destroy their government, unlels in its
operation the rights of the people are really op
prefled, and unless they-have attempted in vain
every constitutional mode of obtaining redress.
These principles ought to operate with peculiar
force upon the people of England, becauie in the
uncertain and hazardous event of a revolution,
they have more to lofe,and less to gain, than any
other European nation, and because whatever
they may acquire, mult in all probability be pur
chased at theexpenfe of a civil war. Whenpro
vifion is made for the alteration of a constitu
tion, otlierwife than by the common legislative
power, it may be done comparatively without
difficulty or danger ; but where this power is al
ready delegated, with the other powers of legis
lation, the people cannot use it themselves, ex
cept in their original, individual, unrepresented
character, and they cannot acquire the riglit to
atflin that capacity, until the power which they
have thus conveyed in trust, has been abdicated
by the extreme abufesofits adminiltration.
When Mr. Paine invited the people of En
gland to destroy their present government and
form another constitution, he should have given
them sober reasoning, and not flippant witticisms.
He fliould have explained to thein the nature of
the grievances, by which they are opprefled, and
demonstrated the iinpoflibiliry of reforming the
government in its present organization. He
flyould have pointed out to them some poflible
method for them to act in their original charac
ter, without a total diflolution of civil society
among them ; he lhonld have proved, what great
advantages they would reap as a nation from such
a revolution, without disguising the great dan
gers and formidable difficulties, with which ic
must be attended.
Tlie principal and most dangerous abufts in
the Englifli government, arise less from the de
feats inherent in the constitution, than from the
state offociety ; âtlie universal venality and cor
ruption which pervades all clafles ofmen in that
kingdom, and which a change ojf government
could not reform. 1 fhal! consider this fubjedl
more largely here ftev; but at present with re
fpecfl to tlie expediency of a revolution in En
gland, I mull enquire how the nation can be
brought to act in their original character ? Mr.
Pains, perhaps from the delicacy of his (itua
tion, has said nothing openly upon this very im
portant point. Yet in two different parts of his
work he seems obscurely to hint two methods for
the accomplishment of this object. When he
compares the htuation of the citizens of London,
to that of the inhabitants of Paris, just before
the taking of the Baftile, it seems as if it was
with an intention to recommend a similar infur
redtion for the pnrpofe of dispersing the parlia
ment, and expelling the king, nvhich would
leave the nation without any government at ail,
and compel them at all events to ast in their ori
ginal character. When he advises " Revolutions
by accommodation," he mult probably mean that
a convention (hould be called by atft of parlia
ment to regenerate their constitution.âl cannot
imagine any other method of answering his pur
pose. Mr. Paine seems to think it is as easy for
a nation to change its government, as for a man
to change his coat; but I confefsbolh the modes
of proceeding which he (uggefts, appear to me
to be liable to great objections.
Mcifrs. Childs & Swaine,
TF the following hints refpetfing Toll Bridges
1 and Turnpike Roads, will be of any use, please
to insert them.
Roads and Bridges, especially upon the great
port: road, through the Union, are objects of na
tional moment. Dispatch in a courier, may (up
prefs an insurrection in the bud. Expediting the
baggage or artillery of an army, one day, may
save a seaport of fir ft rate conlequence, or a PÂ°ft>
which is the key of the union. Shortening the dii
tance, and lefieuing the time, which it consumes
to allemble our national representatives, is a ve
ry important object. The speedy promulgation
of their acts and proceedings, lias the happieit
tendency to preserve peace and good ordei , as
well as to prevent the sudden palling of injurious
laws. To commerce, it is of great consequence.
The enterprising merchant makes his {pecula
tions, or saves his insurance, with advantage, and
promptness. Early intelligence, and dispatch,
are of very great use to liim. The gentleman of
fortune, or the invalid, travelling for pleasure,
or health, vific various states and climes, and
scan limn an nature in its varied modes and ha
bits, with ease and fafety. I conceive that Toll
Bridges and Turnpike Roads, are the moll effec
tual and most equitable means of accomplishing
so deiirable a business. The smaller advantages
arising from them would be, impeding the im
portation of foreign convidts, vagabonds and
paupers: detecting highwaymen, hoife thieves,
and other villains. I have heard that in En
gland, if a gentleman is robbed, he gives notice
at the firft turnpike, the alarm is pailed ; and
villains are often detected in this way. They
generally keep tie high roads to great cities;
when they deviate into villages, and bye roads,
every cottager notices the horse, and dress of
theftranger; so will the toll gate man, for he
may get a reward by it. If.attention was paid
to the selection of steady, discreet men, they
might be cloathed with the powers of a consta
ble. Let us suppose that besides the bridges,
there were ten toll-gates, between Paules Hook
and Philadelphia ; and that the whole amount
of the toll, came to one third of a dollar, for
each traveller on horseback, or in a carriage ;
I presume the prodntfi of this money properly
laid out upon the roads, in three year's time,
would save half a day's time and expences to tra
vellers, who then would lose by it ? or rather,
who would not be benefited by it ?
The comparatively litfle state of New Jersey,"
has set a noble example of public spirit; ihe has
no foreign commerce, and of vf
ry prompt, or productive sources of revenue.
She has undertaken three magnificent bridges.
I could wifli them ceded to the union, on the
fame footing as light houses. It would be no
great affair for New-York and Philadelphia, to
advance on loan, the film requisite for their im
mediate completion. The rwo bridges between
Newark and Paules Hook, wi: 1 give access to a
great tracl of fertile country, between it and
Morris-Town, near thirty miles back, to come
to the New-York market, with great ease. Mar
ket people chufe in hot weather to travel in the
night, with their perifiiable commodities; to
cross ferries at all hoursin the night, withhorfes,
carts and waggons, is troublefonie and dange
rous, as well as very expensive. In cold weather,
when the sledding is good, hundreds of sleds
will probably pass these bridges with loads of
fire wood, poultry, meal and other pro villous so
as to reach the banks of the Hudson 111 season in
rhe morning for market. Loads of fuel would
scarcely pay the sxpence of the two ferries. In
a severe feaion, the ordinary water communica
tion which supplies New-York with firing is cut
off, and wood is scarcer for the distance of fortv
miles by land, than it is within twelve miles of
1 aules Hook, on the Jersey fide.
Should either our corporation, or individuals,
form temporary magazines on the Jersey fliore'
to receive the wood when scarce, they would find
their account in it. Seldom a day pafles, but a
boat may rrofs.
So long as Philadelphia continues to be the
feat of government, she would have a great in
flux of company, and money ofcourfe, from the
states east of her, in consequence of good roads
and budges. February and March, are the mofl
leisure months in the year, to men of business
to merchants and tradesmen ; and at this very
leafon, the floating or rotten ice, in my concep
tion, make.s the transportation of a family, f 10 m
New-York to Philadelphia, by land, more" dange
rous than n ,s by sea, to Richmond, in Virginia

FROM THE (CONNECTICUT) FARMER'S JOURNAL,
Messrs. Printers,
I NOW t ran fin it to you for publication, the
Census of Connecticut, taken in 1756, and
1762, by the King's order, which bj being'com
pared with the lad return of the Cenfus,Â°taken
in 1790, may serve to (hew the rapid increase of
population, notwithstanding the vast emigration
from this State to others.
In r 7?6,
111 1762,
Increase in 21 years, 12,788 1,003
By the ]ast return, made in t 790, there appears
to be 232,371 Whites; lo that the difference be
tween the numbers in 1 756, and 1 790, (the term
only of 34 years) appears to be 104,159 Whites,
and 1,981 Blacks: The Blacks in 1 790 amount
j"g t( > 5,568. The difference from 1762 to 1790,
is 91,371 Whites (the increase in 28 years) and
978 Blacks. So that the increase of Blacks in the
last 28 years is not so great by 25 perlons, as it
was iiuhe preceding 6 years.

' I 1 HE strength of the present Minidry does not
so much confiit in its political connection as in
us incorruptible purity. There are no dark do
ings, 110 secret jobsâno bribe worthy servicesâ
ill is open and above board, directed by wisdom,
upheld by truth,and fancftioned by justice. Even
the avowed political enemies of government are
at a loss for any fubjetft of complaint.
I he Princefles of France, when they were the
King s daughters, were fomethinjp, now they are
become the King's Aunts, they are nothing.â
r hey are amiable, they are decent, they are in
nocent, and they are women, and while the pri
vileges and honors of their birth are taken from
them, they are not permitted to employ the liber
ty which is given them in exchange, in running
away.
In Germany, an excellent anil cheap die h3S
been invented by Mr. Vogler, adapted to woolen
and cotton manufactures. It consists limply of
the feeos of ihe red trefoil, a plant very common
in this country, and used to feed horses and cat

different mineral fubttances, and the dies pro
duced are very beautiful, and of a great variety.
Among these are yellows and greens of different

Died lately, at Shirehampton, in his Bift year,
after a long and painful illness, without a ftru<r
gle or a groan, the Rev. Walter Chapman, Doc
tor of Divinity, Mailer of St. John's Hospital,
Bath, Vicar of Bradford, Wilts, and Senior Pre
bendary of Bristol. He held the very valuable
Mastership of St. John's Hospital 54, and Preben
dal Stall in the Cathedral 45 years. He was not
only a contemporary, and Fellow Collegian, but
in habits of the cloi'eft intimacy and friend(hip
wilh the late Dr. Samuel Johnson, Shenftone, and
many other literary characters ; he partook of
their several excellencies, and was t-ijually dif
linguiflied for deep and universal erudition, a
brilliant and piercing genius, and a challe claf

K I N G S T O N, (Jam.) April 16.
Saturday morning, in consequence of a difa
greement of Tome Handing, a rencounter took
place between Robert Ewart and Walter Brett,
Esquires, in the piazza adjoining Edie's coffee
houfe, in which the former received a pirtol ihot
in his body, which almolt instantaneously put a
period to his existence. An inqweft was imme
diately held on the body, and several witnefles
examined, when the verdicfi returned was,
" That Robert Ewart, the deceased, did on the
nineteenth of April, aflault Walter Brett, of the
parish of Kingston, gentleman, with a whip,
which he, the said R. Ewart, then and there had
in his right hand, and did strike the said Walter
Brett several times with such whip : whereupon
the said Walter Brett, in his own defence, drew
a pistol from his pocket, and then and there (hot
the said R. Ewart through the body, by the
means of a ball, which the said W. Brett, in his
own defence, fired from the said Pistol ; by
means of which fliot or wound, the said R. Ew
art came by his death." Mr. Brett immediately
forrendercd himf'clP iu ilic officers orjultice. Oh
the inquest, a loaded pirtol was found in the
pocket of Mr. Ewart.
On Tuesday Mr. Brett was removed by habeas
corpu3, from the goal of this town to Spnnifh-
Town, and entered into recognizances before
the hon. \V r . Jackson, Esq. one of the judges of
the supreme court, himfelf in 40001. and two
Jureties in 20001. each for his appearance at the
ensuing affixes for this county.
Wednef I ly the grand jury found a bill against
IMr. lit ctt, for the murder of Robert Ewart : and
yefterd.iy his trial came on at liie court ho life,
when after a long and patient examination of
evidence, the general tenor of which went to ex
culpate the prisoner, and to involve in inextrica
ble infamy the character of the deceased, a few
arguments were heard from counl'el on both
fides, and the jury, without hesitating, returned
a verdict of not guilty ; to the fatisfadtion of a
crowded audience, who testified their approbati
on by repeated fliouts of applanfe,âThe trial
lasted from eleven o'clock in the forenoon, until
near fix in the evening.
J he advance in the price of raw fngars has, as
it might be expecfted, had considerable effetft on
the 1 etail price of what is refined ; single is now
at fiftten pence per pound, powder-loaf at eigh
teen pence, and doubie refined at twenty-one
pence halfpenny.
There are (aid to be, at this time, upwards of
thirty fail of large ships engaged in the African
(I tve-trade alone, at the port of Havre de Grace,
which trade the merchants there carry 011 with
a very high hand ; notwithllanding our humane
Have bill has actually caused a very considerable
rile in the price of (laves, not only in the Welt-
Indies, hue 011 the coast of Africa likewise.

Philadelphia, June 29.
The PRESIDENT of the United States has been pleased to ap
point Oliver WolcotTj jun. Esq. Comptroller of the Trea
'urvofthe United Siates.
Saturday last arrived here from Charleston, the Hon. Ralph
Izard, Senator, and William Smith, Esq. Representative of
the State of South-Carolina in the Congrels of the United States.
We hear that one thousand fharcs in the Bank of the United
Stales, by the last account from that place, are already fubferibed
by the Citizens of South-Carolina, principally by the Merchants
and others ol Charleston. Between seven and eight thousand dol
lars, part of the specie deposit, were lodged in the Bank of North-
America this week by William Smith, Esq.
A fubfeription for twd thousand four hundred shares in Boston
was filled in four days, and the specie deposit, amounting to sixty
thousand dollars, paid in to-the Maffachufctts Bank.
By a proclamation of the 18th ult. of the Governor of St. Kites,
the provisions mentioned in an ast of parliament prohibiting an
intercourse between the United States of America, and the Ifiands,
are (ufpended until the twentieth of next.

In die English papers, there is a royal procla

forcibly taken away, and compelling to undergo

Clementina Clarke, an infant of the age of fifteen
years
European politics have for some time part been
involved in clouds and thick darkness. Great-
Britain, not long since, incurred an enormous
expence to arin the nationâro negotiateâthat ne
gotiation it isfaidturned out favorably fortheni
but whether the advantages counterbalanced the
colt, has never appeared. They are now arming
again; some letter-manufadturers on this fdrnf
the water, fay this is all king-craft to divert the
people from revolution-making, and to prevent
the contagion of the French leverâthe ostensi
ble object, however, fs to preserve the balance of
power, by preventing Catharine from adding to
her immense dominions the empire of the Turks.
Commercial douceurs have doubtless been ten
dered to the British government by the Porte, to
induce this interference; there is every probabi
lity that they will interfere; whether luccefsful
1y or not, is uncertainâthe profpetft is in favor
of a peace between the Belligerent powers with
out another campaign, 'i here is, however, a
very great opposition in England to a Ruffian
war. Some of those ideas have been called up
which would have operated against the Turks a
century agoâbut at this day, the only oljetf with
nations is to promote their immediate interelt, at
the facrifice of every other confederation.
Our allies of Trance are pursuing the work of
reformationâthe Revolution is a great work;
and tho it has been long in hand, we ought to re
member that its ohjecfts are itnnienfe. Nothing
less than ro regenerate twenty-five millions of
fouls ! âand this regeneration has refpedi not only
to turning this 2J millions from darkness to light,
and to transform them from idolators of the
Church, the Pope, aud the Grand Mcnarqne, that
71
ttiey may become enemies to all threeâbut it also
includes the idea of annihilating all factitious me
rit, and tiiles of honor anil nobility founded 011
f'uch fallacious ideasâto which, by precept, edu
cation and hnbit, the people of France have for
a series of ages been accuftomcd and attachedâ
tills regeneration alii) refpefis the mercantile cha
racter which the French nation is to aflume, and
there is no doubt at all that this great transfor
mation will take placeâbut then they will require
time, except political regeneration is like rl-ec
tÃl cityâwhich indeed fceins to be the cafe.
The Emperor of Germany, by pursuing a dif
ferent line of conduct from that adopted by his
brother Joseph, lias tranqtiilized his dominions for
the prefeut ; but some appearances seem to indi
cate that the embers of infurreciion are but slight
ly covered, and that the firfi. untoward wind that
blows, will puff them into a flame. Whether
Leopold will desert Catharine, is uncertainâsome
accounts wear that complexion ; others fay, he
never will abandon so faithful and powerful an
ally.
The petty states of Germany, who were afFeifl
ed in their property by the French revolution,
and who appeared to be making preparations to
aflert and vindicate their claims, according to
some late French paragraphs, have had their de
mands liquidated, and no apprehensions are en
tertained of their attempting any thing lioftile
to the revolution. An article has however ap
peared in a late paper, purporting that M. de
Conde had aflembled an army of 10,000 men in
the neighbourhood of the frontiersâtime, the
great interpreter, will ascertain the truth of all
reports.
" Who shall decide when Doctors disagree."âBut do they so
essentially differ that their advice cannot fafely be followed ? The
conduÂ£t of mankind in general puts a negative on the qneftion.
At the last extremity, at least, the Doctor must be sent forâand if
we have faith in their prescriptions at the most critical and difficult
moment, surely it is more rational to take their advice, when dis
ease has but just begun its attacks, and when nature is able to co
operate with art and medicine in our favor. Intemperance is said
to destroy more than the sword ; but it may well be queried whe
ther want of information docs not destroy more than either. The
Faculty have long since had my applause awarded them ; as pro
felfional men, their benevolence and philanthropy is abundantly
exemplified. May they not ftlll add to the lustre of their charac
ter, by publishing in those vehicles which insinuate themselves al
most every where, such hints % cautions, admonitions, advice and pre
ftriptions, as the fcafon of the year, and the apparent state of the
public health may require ?âThere is but one obje&ion to this
proposition that I can think ofâand that (hall not be mentioned.
Forthelaft fifty years the world has been amused with the
dreary anticipations of gloomy fpeculatifts, who have been conti
nually predicting the downfall of the credit of Great-Britain
but, judging from thepajl, there is no great reason to conclude that
the experience of the juture will fanclion the dreams of fucb vj_
fionarics. The present Prime Minister (Mr. Pitt) has abfolutelv
checked the accumulation of their national debt: He has funk,
moie than fix millions of the capital during his administration
which is at as great a rate as is compatible with the real, eflential
intcrefts of that people. For let any one soberly rcfleft on the
-ttobable consequences which would result from suddenly paying

precious metals as

mifrhiefs than such an immen

Mr. Pitt are to preserve the refpe&ability, the
of his country âthese are the only solid basis on which the iriduf
try of a country restsâan undifiurbed produÂ£live industry will
work out the political salvation of any country on the face of the
globe.
