THE siege and defence of Orleans, may be a
good lecfture on the military art, but is not
directly to our purpose which at present is only
to relate the- fortunes and catastrophes of the
great a<ftors in those scenes of emulation, which
have been before described. There was in the
party of the Hugonots a gentleman, named Pol
trot, of an active mind and a designing charac
ter. He had lived some years in Spain ; and
having afterwards embraced Calvinism, and re
sided some time at Geneva, he discovered so much
zeal for his new faith, and entered with so much
zeal into all the intrigues of the party, that the
Calvinifts in general considered him, as a per
sonage capable of attempting in their favor the
moll hazardous enterprizes. It is not one of the
leafc evils of a civil war, that ne man's charac
ter is secure against suspicions and imputations
of the mod enormous crimes. It is almott the
nniverfal pratftice for each party to charge the
leaders of the other, with every bafeaftion, eve
ry sinister event, and every high handed wick
edness, without much consideration or enquiry,
â whether there is truth or evidence or even co
lour to support the accusation. The Catholics
pretended that the Admiral and Theodore Beza,
engaged Poltrot to aflaflinate the Duke of Guise,
by proniifes of great rewards, and by persuading
him that he could do nothing more acceptable to
God, than to deliver his people from their most
cruel persecutor. Poltrot yielding to their in
stigations, pretended to have abandoned the
Calvinift party, and threw himfelf into the roy
al army, where having infintiated himfelf into
the house of the Duke of Guise, he watched for
a favorable moment to execute his design. The
24th of February, 1563, the Duke after having
given his orders for an aflanlt which lie intended
to make the next day, at the bridge of Orleans,
returned at right to his quarters about a
leaguediftant from the trenches ; Poltrot, mount
ed on a Spanish horse, very fleet, waited for him,
on his paflage, and feeing him accompanied, only
by a gentleman of the Queen, with whom he was
closely engaged in conversation, he fhor him in
the back, with an arquebufe, loaded with three
balls. The Duke was without arms, the three
balls struck him under the right Ihoulder and
pierced him through the body ; He fell from his
horse for dead. His gentlemen, who marched
before, that they might not interrupt his con
versation, returned, at this accident, and car
ried him to his lodgings where as soon as they had
examined his wound, his life- was despaired of.
The King, the Queen Mother and all the Loids
in the army, at the news of so fatal a disaster,
Jiaftened to the Duke's lodgings ; but all their
cares and remedies were useless ; he died in
three days, with great sentiments fays Davila,
of piety and religion, discovering in his dis
courses agreatnefsof foul and a moderation moll
admirable. This Prince, united with the high
est valour and lingular abilities, a consummate
prudence. As profound in council, as adtive in
execution, he always saw his designs crowned
â with the happiest success. The(e qualities had
procured him the reputation of the firft Captain
of bis age, and his exploits merited the title of
the defender and prote&or of the Catholic re
ligion. He left a name glorious and celebrated
10 posterity, tarnished however to endless ages with
the jttji imputation oj intolerance.
Poltrot had escaped into a neigliboiing sorest ;
but tortured by the remorse of his conscience,
and by the terror of being pursued on all fides,
he wandered all night in the woods, without be
ing able to find the road to Orleans. The next
morning exhausted by fatigue, he was arretted
by some Swiss guards and Jed to the Queen and
the principal officers of the army. He alter
nately accused and acquitted both on the rack
nnd at his execution the Admiral and Theodore
Beza, who published declarations throughout all
Europe, denying in the nioft solemn manner their
knowledge of the design of Poltrot. The court
battened the execution of this monster, before
an opportunity had been given to confront and
examine him, as the Admiral requetted by quar
tering him between four horses. The confe
rence was that the suspicion was fattened, on
these two austere and excellent characters, in
the minds of the Catholic party, though they

ENIGMA.CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SATURDAY, Feb. y.
The B ANK BILL under cons deration
MR. STONE said : If upon questions like
the present he had given pain to members
he regarded, the)' might be aflured the pain was
reciprocal. Let us cherish mutual toleration.
We might conceive that each pursued improper
fyltems from the purest morives. We differ in
our ideas of government and our sense of the
facrednefs of the written compact. We varied
widely in our opinions of the dire&ion of this
government: The gieat lellon of experiment
would /how who is right ; but we are influenced
in our habits of thinking by our local situations,
and perhaps the diftin<ft interests of the States we
represent. He observed, that upon the present
occasion the opinions refpedting the constitution
seem ro be divided by a geographical line, di
viding the continent. Hence it might be infer
red that other considerations mixed with the
question ; and it had been insinuated that it was
warped by the future feat of government. But
other causes may be afligned for the diversity of
(entiment ; the people to the eaftvvard began
earliest in favor of liberty : They pursued free
dom into anarchy ; starting at the precipice of
confufion they are now vibrating far the other
way. He said that all our taxes are paid by the
consumers of manufa<stures ; thofc taxes are all
bounties upon home manufaiftures. The people
to the eastward are the manufacturers of this
country ; it was no wonder that they should en
deavor to strengthen the hands of a government
by which they are so peculiarly benefited.
It is a fadl that the greatest part of the Conti
nental Debt has travelled Eaftwardof the Potow
niackâThis law is to raise the value of the Con
tinental Paper. Here then (fays he) is the
Jtrong impulse of immediate interest in favor of
the BankâHe took notice of the diltin&ion made
by the plan of the bill, between Continental and
State PaperâThe State Paper on account of par
tial payments of interest still remained in the
refpetftive states. But this could not by the
present system be subscribedâso that the South
ern States were deprived of the advantage that
might have been given to the only paper they
have. But (he said) if Gentleman charge us
with defending the feat of government, let
them remember that this betrays consciousness of
ari attack. If they believe that this scheme tends
to break the faith of the union pledged to the
Potowmack, it is no wonder they suppose we op
pose it upon that ground. He would not have
mentioned this fubjetfl, had it not been hinted
at. But let the whole of it come forthâlet gen
tlemen consult their own bosoms ; let the pub
lic decide the truth of his observations. He
hoped he should not be fufpecfted of any biafs
so uniform had been his conduit upon all
questions, turning upon principles fiinilar to the
present, that every member in the house, he be
lieved, had conjectured rightly of the fide he
would take before he had uttered a word upon
the fubjed. When implication firft raised its
head in this house, he started from it asaferpent
which was to Iting and poison the constitution.
He felt in unison with his country. The fears
the opinions, the jealousies of individuals and of
states, had been explained by a gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. Madison). He should only remark,
that all those who opposed the government,
dreaded this dodtrineâthofe who advocated it
declared that it could not be resorted toâand all
combined in opinion that it ought not to be to
lerated. Never did any country more compleat-
Iy unite in any sentiment than America in thisâ
â ' ' hat Congress ought not to exercise, by im
plication, powers not granted by the constitu
tion' And it is not ftrangeâfor the admission
ot this dodlrme destroys the principle of your
government at a blowâit at once bn?aks down
every barrier which the federal constitution had
raised against unlimited legislation. He said that
necenity was the rnoft plaunble pretext for break
ing the spirit of the social compact; but the peo
ple of this country have anticipated that pretext
They have said to the ministers of this coun
ry, " We have given you what we think com
petent powers; but if experience proves them
inadequate, we will enlarge themâbut in the
mean time dare not usurp those which we have
reserved."
It is agreed on all hands that the power to in
corporate the subscribers to a bank is not ex
pressly granted, and although gentleman have
agreed that it is impliedâ that it is an incident
âthat it is a means, for effectuating powers ex
prefsly granted ; yet they are not agreed as to
the particular power to which this is an incident.
They admit that the Iweeping clause in the con
stitution confers no additional power. But it
he understood the gentlemen, several of them
were of opinion that all governments iuftituted
for certain ends draw to them the means of exe
cution as of common right. This dotflrine would
make our's but afhoit constitution. (Here he
read the preamble) and then saidâHere is youi
constitution ! Here is your bill of rights ! Do
these gentlemen require any thing more refpecii
ingthe powers of Congress, than a defenption
of the ends of government ? and if of ight they
can carry these into effetft, will they regard the
means tho they be expressly pointed out But I
would ask if there is any power under heaven
which could not be exercised within the exten
sive limits of this preamble f
The convention might have flopped hereâand
there was no need, according to the dotftrine of
the gentlemen, to point out any of the means for
the ends mentioned in the preamble. That por
tion of the constitution which, by all America,
has been thought so important, according to their
logic, would become a dead letter; but the pre
amble in fair conftrudlion is a solemn compadt,
that the powers granted lhall be made use of to
the ends thereby fpecified.
He then reprobated in pointed terms the lati
tude of the principles premised. He faici the
end of all government is the public goodâand
if the means were left to legiflaiion, all written
compacts were nugatory He observed, that the
sober discretion of the legislature, which in the
opinions of gentlemen ought to be paramount,
was the very thing intended to be curbed and
restrained by our constitution.
He then declared that our form of government
not only pointed out the ends of government,
but fpecified the means of execution. He said
we may make warâthis would draw to it the
power of raising an army and navy, laying taxes,
establishing a judiciary, &c. But the spirit of
the constitution in this refpert had been well ex
plained by Mr. Madison, and he fliould not re
capitulate.
He faida gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr.
Smith) had remarked that all our laws'proceeded
upon the principle of expediencyâthat we were
judges of that expediencyâas soon as we gave it
as our opinion that a thing was expedient, it be
came constitutional. What then, said he, re
mains of your constitution, except its mode or
organization ! We may look into it to refrefh our
memories, refpetfing the times, places and man
ner of cotnpofing the governmentâthat as to
the powers of Congress, were he of that gentle
man's opinion, he would never look into it again.
Gentlemen fee the difficulties of their theories,
and are obliged to confefs, that these incidental
powers are not easily defined. They relt in the
sober discretion of the legislature.
One gentleman (Mr. Ames) has said, no im
plication ought to be made against the law of
natureâagainst rights acquiredâor against pow
ers pre-occupied by the flakes ; that it iseafierto
restrain than to give competent powers of exe
cution. Now there notions are hostile to the
main principle of our government, which is only
a grant of particular portions of power, imply
ing a negative to all others. It has been fliown
that the ends of government will include every
thing. If gentlemen are allowed to range in
their sober discretion for the means, it is plain
they have no limits. By the cabaliftical word
incident, your constitution is turned upfidedown ;
and instead of being a grant of particular powers,
guarded by an implied negative to all others, it is
made to imply all powers. But, strange to tell,
America forgot to guard it by express negative
provisions. Is there any difference in effect be
tween lodging general powers in a government,
and permitting the exercise of them by subtle
conftruiflions ? He said there was a difference
In the one cafe, the people fairly gave up their
liberty, and stood preparedâin the other, they
were unexpectedly tricked out of their confti

the following letter from the king .â¢
" I wifli you, fir, to wait upon me this even

Plots and confpiraces continue to be talked of
in various parts of the kingdom ; but we have
been To much accustomed to filch alarms, that we
riafs less regard to them than formerly. The
ferment among the clergy has been general ; but
they have not been able to commuicate it to the
people, by whom all their attempts to excite di
fturbanres, even where the magistrates have be
trayed or neglected theirduty, have been watch
fd and defeated. The sale of church and crown
lands lias far exceeded expectation ; the aflijr
nats are alieadyin the process of being cancel,
led : the troops of the line in general continue
steady to their duty ; and taxes begin to be re
gularly paid.
LONDON, January 10.
It is very much apprehended that the Grand
Vizir will be obliged, in all cases, to give way to
the Ruffian troops, or run the rifle of havina the
reft of his army entirely destroyed.
Of more than too,ooo men which he had tin
der his command, above 60,000 Asiatics have de
serted, in i'pire of entreaties, remonstrances, and
menaces to induce them to stay.
Out of the 40,000 which remained some time
ago, many were daily deferring. And in thefe
veral marches, sieges, and Ikirmifhes which they
have made and sustained, many more have pe
ri lhed.
It is expected, that the negociations at Schif
tovi, will be interrupted by the Ruffian troops
particularly by the Colfacks, and that it will be
liecellary to name some other town for the meet
ing of the Congress.
It has been lately recommended to fuebgen
tlemen as chufe to travel with fire artns, when
they find themselves attacked by a mounted high
wayman, to shoot rather at the horse which the
highwayman rides than at the man. The rea
sons for this recommendation are said to be the
following: 1 It. They would not be so likely to
miss the mark they aim ai s not one highwayman
in a thousand would be able to keep his feat un
der the exertions that a wounded horse would
make ; and in cafe the horse fliould be killed,the
man would, of course, fall an easy prey. 2d.
Beranfe very few highwaymen ride upon their
own horses, and the killing the horse would be
a check to those jockies and others, who let out
horses for the scandalous purposes of robbing.
?d. Killing the horse would not so much wound
the conscience as killing one of our own species,
who by this means would be sent into hell out
right with the fin he was committing irreversibly
upon him.
On Monday lalt as Thomas Evans, a carrier,
was on the road to Shrewsbury, after being in a
moll: violent rage with one of his horses which
did nor go onto his fatisfaclion, beating the poor
animal, and uttering the mod dreadful oaths, he
suddenly dropped down deadâan awful warning
toprophane swearers, and to those unfeeliggper
fons who use poor worn out animals with wanton
cruelty !
On the police of the Turks, in the severe pn
nifliments inflicted upon those who make use of
falfe weightsand measures, Mr. Howard confirm
ed the account given by many other travellers.
He spoke highly of some part of the moral cha
racter of the Turks, particularly of their grati
tude for favors received, and said, that when he
has been lucky enough to cure a rich Turk of
some disorder, he offered him a purse of 2000 se
quins. This, however, Mr. Howard would not
accept of, and requested only that his patient
would permit him occasionally to fend to his
garden for some grapes and oranges to eat with
his tea at breakfaft. The Turk sent him every
morning a large baiket full of the choicest fruits
his garden produced.
NEW DISCOVERY.
Mr. Watson, plumber in Newcafile, (Bngland)\
has lately finifhed, by Mr. Ker's direction, two
coppers for condensing and preserving the eflen
tial oils of hops, which have been eredled in the
Tyne and Hexham breweries, and given the great
est fatisfacSion to the proprietors, who have most
liberally rewarded Mr. Ker, for the exercise of
his valuable discovery.
The inventor discovered, what is aftonifliing
no one ever observed before him, in the
common way of impregnating worts with the
virtues of the hops, the finer and more aromatic
flavorof these was dissipated in vapor, while the
disagreeable bitter quality alone remained.
In consequence of this observation he devise ,
a method of collecting the vapor, which he foun
to be principally composed of the eflential oil oIthe plant. This oil he returned into the worts
[in their fermenting Hate, and the result exceed
ed his mod sanguine expeditionsâthe liquor ac
quired an infinitely more delicate flavor, and what
is of equal importance, became beyond all coin
parifon less susceptible of passing into the four
state ; while, at the fame time, asone fourth less
hops was requisite in boiling the worts, their
nauseous bitter quality was imparted in apropor
. tionably smaller degree.
National Atfembly, December 27
Fifty eccleliaftical members took the Civic Oath
agreeable to a form prepared : On this occasion
the Abbe Gregoire pronounced adifcourfe to the
Aflembly, which was ordered to be printed.
Dicevtber 28 29
An address from a society at Clermont Ferrard,
informed the Ailembly, that the reports of a coun
ter-revolution, tho so often vague and unfound
ed, are real in regard to the commotions in Au
vergne where plotsagainft the government are
actually forming : This address prelfesthe a (Tern
bly to erecT; a High Court of Treason. It was or
dered to be published.
In the town of Paniiers, another bloody tu
mult has happened âin which many lives were
loft.
The Aflembly decreed that every discovery of a
new invention, in any kind of industry, is the
property of its author.
No new President is yet declared : M. de Mi
rabeau wanted but four votes in the last scrutiny
to get in the chair.
Jan. 4. The usual compliments on the renew
al of the year were paid on Saturday last, by the
President, at the head of a deputation, to the
King, Queen and the Dauphin.
These addrefles anticipate the moment as fact
approaching, which in terminating the labors of
the Aflembly, will invariably fix the public wel
ware : It recognizes the harmony and concord
which exist between the King and the Aflemblyâ
â which they fay rauft destroy the frivolous hopes
ofthofe who are equally the enemies of the King
and the Aflembly.
The answer of the King exprefles his sense of
the attachment of the Aflembly to his personâ-
and recurs to that confidence which now subsists
between him and them, as that, which aloite will
perfect and consolidate the great wortâthe con
flitution of the kingdom.
BOSTO N, March 12
Extra ft of a letter from Marietta f dated Nov. 25,
" Between Fort Pitt and this place, we were
hailed by people on an island, in the utmost dis
tress: They had funk their boat, and were obli
ged to swim to the islandâmen, women and chil
dren. They informed us that two of their chil
dren, a girl of iJ, and a boy of 5 years old, not
being able to reach the ihore, were gone down
the current on part of the wreck ; I immediately
got into a Ikiff we happened to have with us, and
two good men with me, and overtook the wreck
in three quarters of an hour, 8 miles from the
island, and fotind the girl with her little brother
fitting ofi a few boards which fell together in the
â wreck.âThere were in all about 20 people on
the iflandâ(Their boat funk about day-light of
a cold morning)âthey were wet, and chilled al
310ft to deathâthey had been there almost: an
hour, and some of their children were almost
gone. The diftrefled mother would take nonou
rifliinent until they came down to us, and we
were able to make them hear from the wreck,
that all was well. They came on with us to this
place, and;-, continued in our boat to the Miami,
â¢where they were boundâThe parents of the two
children were from New-Jersey, by the name of
Ludlowâthey loft almost all they had, cloathing
money, cattle and horses."
BALTIMORE, March 18
" Ycfterday, being the Anniversary of the im
mortal St. PATRICK, the tutelar St. of Hibernia,
the day was celebrated here in ail unusual style
of taste and splendour. Agreeably to a recent
communication, the Saint made his personal ap
pearance, and honored his sons with his presence
in a procellion through the town. He was dres
sed in his primitive robes, and read, as he palled
along, the Holy Scriptures, with great apparent
devotion ; an example, it is hoped, his children
will follow in their pallage through life. After
the procellion was over, and the company had pai
taken of a repast, suitable to the day and occali
on, (at Mr. Brett's on Fell's-Point) the venera
ble Saint gave them the most interesting advice
for the regulation of their future conduct in the
pilgrimage of life, which appeared to have a ve
ry happy effecftâwhen, giving them his inoft af
fectionate and fervent Benediction, he disap
peared.

LITERATURE.
M. L'Abbe Vella, a very learned profeflor of
the Oriental Languages, in Sicily, has announced
that he saw at Girgentia, a volume of cotton pa
per, written in the Wetlern Moorish character,
that contains a translation into Arabic of seven
teen books of that part of Livy's History which
is wanting. It goes from the 6otli to the 77th.
This lail is not complete, and there are foine
chasms in the others, occasioned by being in some
places worm eaten. The 60th begins at the epoch
when the Consul Aurelius fubduced the rebels of
Sardinia, after a very considerable {laughter ;
and went afterwards into Corlica to punilli
who had bidden defiance to him.
The 61ft book opens with the foundation of
Aix, in Provence, by the Pro-Consul L. Sextius,
ft otn whom that city took the name of Aquse
Sextise
The Abbe has already translated some of this
valuable work, and promises to present the Re
public of Letters with an edition in the Arabian
language on one fide, and the Latin or Italian on
the other.

How much preferable to a (late of inquietude,

with a government, that not only inspires confi
