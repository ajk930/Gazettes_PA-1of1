; attradl the attention of the observing world.â
I Every modeff man, who, feels his incompetency
to filling a public pofl: \*jth honor and advan
tage to his country, and reputation to himfelf,
will flirink an appointment.âBut is it
not true tha* we often fee the places which
ought to be occupied by persons of the firft abi
lities, poflfelfed by men, who have the ad
dress to conceal their incapacity by an invin- j
cible filetice in public ? Such men are loqua- 1
cious when it would be happy for their country
if they were tongue-tiedâand by a pertina
cious adherence to taciturnity, when they ought
to be explicit in giving their reasons for their
votes, effectually deceive their constituents.
If fads did not warrant this statement, it woulc!
be thought impoflible that the people could ever
inipof'ed oti in fucti manner, as to elect for re
presentatives, men who never ajlign any
reason for their opinion on any point of political
discussion whatever.
Let it not be inferred from what is here sug
gested, that the writer considers a talent for
public (peaking, or declamation, as an indis
pensable qualification in a reprelentativc; he
is well informed that some gentlemen who were
members of the House of Representatives of)
toe United States distinguished themselves great
ly in committees by the soundness of their judg
ments, and their universal acquaintance with
books and men, who never made a set speech
in Congress ; and it was generally very easy to
aflign a reason for their conduit on most occasions;
especially on important questions ; but could
the fame be said of every silent voter, it does
not follow that oratory or the power of perfiia
fion is not of the highest importance in a free
public aflemblyâ the circumstance just men
tioned is a proof to the contrary ; for those who
do not speak themselves, are undoubtedly influ
enced in their decisions by the best reasons of
fered on each fubjett refpettively, so far as they
are men of candid and liberal minds.
It is further to be remarked, that the best
and most argumentative speakers, are not the
most talkative.
The Constitution of the United States is an
invaluable treasureâit is worth the labor which
it cost : The firft abilities of this country were
employed in framing it ; and fucli abilities
ought to bo engaged in its lupport, and main
tenance. Men of small powers, or weak intel
lects will never be found competent to the un
dertaking. We have seen wife and good men
differ in their conftruftions of the Constitution
âthis will forever be the cafe in refpedt to all
human compoiitions ; how neceifary then is if.
ts have men of clear, discerning heads, anc!
found heats, to draw the line of reason andjuf-
I tieeâto diftinguifli between such a conftrudtion
; as would make the government a nerveless
trunkâa body without a foulâand one that
vould clothe it with powers subversive of those
very rights it was framed and adopted to de
fend ! The rights of menâall that we hold in
estimation as citizens, fathers, brothersâhus
bandmen, merchants, lawyers, clergymen, phy
sicians, mechanics, artizans, fcamen, labourers,
or men of fortuneâdepend on a wife and ener
getic government; on carrying the powers of
the constitution to such an extent as that the
benefits expe&ed from the social compact, sup
ported by so great an expence, as is incurred,
may be realized ; believe itâthis is not to be
effected by medium, or ordinary abilities; 01
by men who have no opinion of their ownânor
poifefs any funds out of which they can form
one that is candid, and competent to the fubjett.
I fay nothing at p'-efent on political tenetsâ
but the flighted reflection will serve to con
vince every one, that as there are various sen
timents supported at the present time, very op
polite in their natureâand each maintained
with uncommon ardor bv their several advo
cate-, the importance of ele&ing men of liberal
mind-,, superior to party attachments, is great
ly ft lengthened by the consideration.
In private life, we are extremely desirous to
.n-ike the best .election of characters to decide
on matters of referenceâand il unhappily en
gaged in a law suit, it is not the ipfe dixit of a
lawyer, that he will do our business in the bell
manner, which induces us to engage his ser
vicesâit is his reputation in thtr world, and
the experience the people of that world have
had of feis abilities, that lead us to give the
man a preference-
Witnejfes.
Let not the interest of our country be less
dear to us ; not every one that cries libertv,
liberty, is a sincere friend to freedom, or that
is equal to defending the rights of freemen.

walks of literary life, instances are frequent of
thoie who, though they were the boast of their
ichool, appear with no superiority of merit*,
when they arc into the world. To
ridicule, for the mod part, they owe their de

of their cotemporaries, who naturally endeavor
to obfeure that lustre, which burps them with
its blaze. They at fir ft value themlelves on

to distress sensibility, and injurious to mankind
to render worth contemptible, we often observe
persons of character joining in the laugh against
modesty and merit. In the moment of social
enjoyment, we do not give ourselves time to
reflect on the consequence of our mirth ; and
perhaps with kind intentions of promoting con

" Mod Gracious Sovereign,
" VVÂ£, your Majesty's most dutiful
and loyal f'ul>je<fts, the Lords Spiritu
al and Temporal, and Commons of
Great Britain, in Parliament alleni
bled, have taken into our most fei ious
confederation your Majesty's Hoj.il
Proclamation, which lias, by your
Majesty's command, been laid before
us : And we beg leave to teftify to
your Majesty our warm and grateful
sense of this frelh proof of your Ma
jesty's constant folicitnde for thewpl
fare and happiness of your people.
We cannot fee, without indignation,
the attempts which have been made
to weaken, in the minds of your Ma
jesty's fubjetfs, the sentiments ofobe
dience to the laws, and of attachment
to the form of government, civil and
religious, so happily eftabliihed with
in this realm. The advantages which,
under the government of your Ma
jesty and your illustrious ancellors,
have been derived from legal and
yvell regulated Freedom, and the un
exampled bleflings which we atftualjjr
enjoy, afford to your Majesty's sub.
jeds peculjpr motives to reflpcft, with
gratitude on their present situation,
and to beware of those delusive theo
ries which are inconsistent with the
relations and duties of all civil socie
ty. And we deem it, under the pre
sent circumstances, the peculiar duty
of every good citizen to discourage
and counteract every attempt, dire<Jb
and indirect, against public order
and tranquility. We are confident
that the sentiments which we now
express to your Majesty, are the ge
neral sentiments of the Nation : They
rnuft feel, with us, that real liberty
can only exist under the protection
of law, and the authority of efficient
and regular government ; and they
have seen, by happy experience, that
the mixed form of our Legislature
comprehends and provides for the
various intererts of the community,
through all its several descriptions :
and maintains and preserves those
gradations of property and condition,
which furnifh the great incentives to
ufeful induflry, and are equally es
sential to the vigor and exertion of
every part, and to the liability and
welfare of the whole. They there
fore know that the collective strength
and prosperity of the empire, its
wealth, its credit, and its commerce,
as well as the only security for the
persons, the property, and the li ber-!.

support your Majesty in the reluluti

and we are fully petfuaded, that eve

Mr. Williams, a mafon,of the coun
ty of Glamorgan, and a Welsh bard,|
fired with the notole spirit of enter-,
prise, is meditating an expedition to
North America, in search of the co
lony of his countrymen which tailed
thither with Madog ap Owen Gjvy
nedd, a Prince of North Wales, wj lo '
according to oral tradition, landed
on the hanks of the Mifliffipp'Â» ' n , ' ,e

vious to the dilcovery of America by
Columbus. , i
1 he concert of the Kings uandsj
some chance of being einbarrafled, it j
not defeated, by thejealoufy of the
German States. The kings of Hun-;
gary and Prussia have not addrefledj
them in ihe moil conciliating terms,
and some of the Ele<Jtors begin al
ready to fee, that if the kings fliould
triumph over the independence of
France, their own independence mult
be the next facrifice.
The war with France is the cause
of much more apprehension in Ger
many than the Bruflels Gazette would
give reason to believe. The alarm
has been felt even at Ratilbonne,
which several personÂ» of diftintfion
left on the firft news of the declara
tion of war.
So heartily is the French Revoluti
on detested at Rome, that to have
been an enemy to it, is fufficient to
secure a man the reputation of every
virtue, even after his death.
We are sorry to fay, it is but too
evident that the despots of Germany
have a perfect understanding with
the Empress of Ruflia in the attack
which (he makes on the conftiturion
and territories of the republic of Po
land. We undeiftand that the King
of Pruflia, who was the firft Prince
made acquainted confidentially with
the changes intended in the system,
as far back as the year 1788, now a -
bandoiu the republic to its fate, and
so far declares hiinfelf against her,
as to refufe the auxiliary troops fti
pulated by the last treaty, in cafe of
an attack on the ftdeof Russiaâunder
the pretext that that treaty is of an
anterior date to the new constitution
of the 3d of May, 1791.
The situation of the French emi
grants, appears to be as hopeless as
ever. The commanders of the Pruf
lian and Auflrian troops will neither
a<ft nor communicate with them.
They will not even fuffer their troops
to converse with tbcfe collected by
the emigrants. The latter are at
leail as much divided among them
selves, as the Jacobins and their op
ponents at Paris.
General Benedict Arnold (better
known during the American war by
the name of one Arnold) was admit

man, if we mistake not, went over to
the continent two or three years ago,
with a number of American Loyalilis,
to form the settlement of New-Brunf
wick, from which he has lately rc
turned.
General Arnold is about to petition
government for a compenfaiion for
his lofles, or to promote his rank,
and give him atlive employment in
any situation befitting his abilities.
It is said that when the lit. Hon.
Secretary fit (I saw Mr.Thomas Paine's
letter to him, heconfulted Mr. Burke
about anfweripg it, but obtained a fe
â¢vere rebuke from the apostate dates
man. " What the Devil, fays he,
don't you think 1 would answer ren
own letters firft, if 1 could, before I'd
touch your's ?"
When the Secretary's Secretary
obtained the firft paper with Mr.
Paine's letter in it, he called his pa
tron at the bottom of the (lairs.
" Wha wants me ?" cries the Princi
pal. There's Paine's epiflle to voni
HonorâFor the firft time in his life
he did na come when called, but ex
claimed, " The Devil burn the letter
and the author togetherâl would
they had boath been ftrawngled in
their birth." He returned toliisful
]en studies and there remained all the
day.

Tuesday the monthly meeting of
this Club was held at the crown

Lord Fetre was in the chair. After
dinner they commenced their leftivi

of Mr. Fox in particular was drank
with the warmett and mod general
enthufiafin.
Mr. Fox fuid, he could not pafsoyer
the very marked compliment which
they had paid to him without return
ing his grateful thanks. He need
[not tell the company what they all
knew, that of late the queftioii of
, Reform in the representation of the
jpeople had been revived.
However warmly be wished for a
{moderate reform in the fyftemof our

under all the obvious circumltances
of the day, the present was the pro-j
per season for the agitation of the

not withhold from it his zealous fjp

After this, many diftinguiihed cha

HOUSE OF LORDS, June ij.
THE PROROGATION.
At a quarter after three o'clock bis
Majesty arrived at the House of Peers,
and beingfeated on the Throne, with
the usual formalities, the Duke of
Leeds bearing the Sword of State, and
Lord Sydney theCapof Maintenance,
Sir Francis Molyneux was fenc to the
House of Commons, to command their
immediate attendance upon his Mfl
jefty.
The Con?mons being come accord
ingly, their Speaker addrefled his
Majesty to the following purport: I
" That his faithful Commons no
content with having carried into ef
fedt a bill, the principle and tenden
cy of which was highly interesting t(
public credit, and to the profperit}
of ihe Kingdom had also made pro
visions for preventingthe future per
manent increase of the national debt
by having resolved that on ali future
loans means should be found for theii
discharge, which operation it was
the hope of the Commons no neceflity
would ever prevent ; as by such pro
vision his Majesty's loyal fubjedis
would be guarded from tliofe difficul
ties in which they had been involved,
and which could only have been sup
ported by that public spirit and pa
triotic zeal, which pervaded all ranks
of his Majesty's people. Oilier ob
jects had also occupied the attention
of ihe Commons, who had the faris
fatfiion of releasing his Majesty's fub
jec'ts from several of the burthens
under which they had labored. The
Commons had also taken measures
to promote the commerce, the manu
factures and the revenue of the em
pire. He allured his majesty of the
determination of his faithful Com
mons to maintain the happy consti
tution of the country, from which the
people looked for an increase of their
blessings, and for the security and
continuance of those of which they
were actually pofTefled.
" T he Colnmons also trusted that
the giving to Juries the right of de
ciding on all cases of libels, would
be highly advantageous, as it gave
uniformity to the law, and security
to the property, the lives and liber
ties of of his Majesty's fubjeifts. He
declared the sense of the Commons of
the enjoyments arising from the pre
sent form of government, the pre
servation of which they were fully
convinced was determined to be per
fevered in by a great and loyal peo
ple. He concluded by faying beheld
in his hand the National" Debt future
102
Loan Bil., to which his Majesty's
faithful Commons prayed his Royal
Allent."
The ClÂ«rk having taken the Bill
to the Table, it teceived the lloyal
Aifent, in the ul'ual forms.
After which his Majelly was pleas
eel to deliver the following molt gra
cious Speech to both Houses ot Par
liament :
My Lurdt and Gentlemen, â¢
I cannot dole the present felfion of
Parliament without returning you
my particular thanks for the atten
tion and diligence with which you
have applied vourfelves to thf; fSjf
patch of the public business, and ef.
ptcially to the important objec'ts
which 1 recommended to your con
iideratioii.
Gentlemen of the Hon fa of Commons,
The readiness with which you have
granted the neceflary supplies, and
tile frefh proof which you have given
of your constant affection for my per
fou and family, in enabling me to
provide for the eftablilhment of my
foil, the Duke of York, call for my
warmed acknowledgments. 1 have
alio observed, with the utmost fatis
faiftion, the measures which you have
adopted for the diminution of the
public burthens ; while you have, at
the fame time, made additional pro
vision for the redu&ion of tlie present
national debt, and established a per
manent fyftein for preventing the
dangerous accumulation of debt in
| future.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I have feenwith great concern the
commencement of hoftilltiesin differ
ent parts of Europe. In the piefent
situation of affairs, it will be my prin
cipal care to maintain that harmony
and good understanding which sub
sist between me and thefeveral belli
gerent powers, and to pi eferve to my
people the uninierrupted blessings of
peace :âAnd the afiurances which 1
receive from all quarters, t>f a friend
[ly disposition towards this country,
| afford me the pleasing hope of suc
ceeding in these endeavours.
The recent expressions of your uni
form and zealous attachment to the
eftablifbed government and constitu
tion, leave me no room to doubt that
you will, in your several counties,
be adtive and vigilaift to maintain
those sentiments in the minds of my
faithful people ; and I have the hap
pinels of receiving continued and
additional proofs of their just sense
of the numerous and increasing ad
vantages which they now enjoy under
the protection and distinguished fa
vour of providence.
Then the Lord Chancellor, by his
Majesty's command, said,
My Lords and Gentlemen,

CHIN f. SB EMBASSY
The Embassy from this country to China has
the advantage, as every public undertaking should,
of much deliberate and laborious preparation.
Among other circumftanccs, the provision of
interpreters should be noticed. Sir Geo. Staunton
bad heard, that fomeChinefe, brought over by the
French Miftionarics, were, iaft fu miner, in an
Italian convtnt, to which they hud gone from
France. He wont over to Italy liimfelf; tJifco
vered their reiidcnce, and obtained leave of the
Pope to bring them to England. Two of them
are now in his house in Harley-Strcet, and two
more arc daily expelled. They aie engaged, at
prcftnt, in learning Englifh,and qualifying them
selves otheÂ» wife for the office of Interpreters to
the Embassy. Some little Chmefe is also learned
from them.
These men are deeply initiated and interested
in the mysteries of the Church of Rome, and
were, therefore, the more readily parted with by
the Pope that ihcy might serve hi* cau'e in China.
The number of persons accompanying this
embassy will be much greater than was exp**6led.

the veuels dragged their anchors, aid for (cm

lay stranded.
Abont eight o'clock in the morning,' the (hip
Britannia, fully loaded, and patenters on board,
parted her cables and ft ruck on the bar about
200 yards from the snore; at which time a boat
with much difficulty got along-side. Jo ephM.
Woodyear, Esq. who was one of the pafTenge-s,
got in the boat, not with a view to personal
fafety, but for the purpose of making a haz -
ous attempt to carry a rope to the shore, which,
was made fact to a raft that had been previmlv
ccmftrufted; the rope unfortunately broke as
soon as he got to the shore, and although seve
ral attempts were made to get the boat off

The ship sustained the fury of t'ie boisterous

she began to go to pieccs; and then tbe.moft
grievous scene presented itielf to thefpeftatw

Attempts were made by some of the crew to
reach the shore, in which several perifbedâa

others, continued on the wreck till three o'clock,
when he was so exhausted, that he either loft
his hold or quitted the wreckâthe raoft vigo

for his recovery proved ineffectual. Mrs. Moore
and her two children, and three soldiers, with
two women and a child, were pafTenger<;, all of
whom perished, except one soldier, with several
of the crew. There were 32 people on board,
of which only ten survivedâthe bodies of all the
others were found and interred on Friday last.
Captain Woodyear was a gentleman deserv

The ftilp George, of Boston, Silas Daggett,

the 17t!i inft. in 35 days from CadizâBy him
we learn, that the people of Spain having ex
prefied great alarm and uneasiness at being kept
in ignorance of what was doing in France, the
Minister thought it best to allow them the liber
ty of speaking freely on political fubje&s; in
conlequence of which the French Constitution
had become the fubjeftof common conversation
in all the coffee-houfes and places of public re
sort That the King of PrufTia had withdrawn
his troops intended to ast against France, in
order to keep a watchful eye over the condutt
of the Empress ofÃulTia, with regard loPoland:
That M. de la Fayette was carrying all before
himâand that wherever he penetrated into the
Austrian dominions, the people had declared in
favor of the French Constitution.
James Napper Tandy, Esq. has been acquit
ted by a Jury in Dublin, on his indi&ment for

Very honorable notice is taken of the zeal

in a letter from Paris, in forming and difcip!in-f
ing the French armyâthat he may bring it to
such perfection as to be an effefhial barrier a
gainst the inroads of the Auftrians or their al
lies. These inceflant cares are however begin
ning to affect a constitution naturally strong,
and a spirit replete with enthufiafmfor the wel
fare and final eftablifhinent of the rights of man
kind. M. de la Favette eats little, and carries
an example of temperance almost to extrava
gance. Sleepless nights and toilsome days are

Capt. Egar, of the Molly, arrived last Thurf- j
day from Cape-Francois, in 12 days, with 22'
passengers. The disturbances at the Cape have
little appearance of ceafirg. The Commander
in Chief had given great disgust, by lending back
| the troops to Old France, which were sent out
for the defence of the iftands. The Mulattos
are in the full enjoyment of liberty, but will not
adt against the Negroes, who continue as turbu
lent as ever. They made a very desperate at
tack on Fort Dauphin, about 3 or 4 clays prior
to Capt. Egar's departure from the island, but
were repulsed with verv inconf:derable loss on
the part of the garrison, although the (laughter
of the blacks could not have been under four or
five hundred. This fort, which is situate be
tween the Cape and Fort-Crispin, is of such con
sequence, that, had it been taken, the Cape must
have inevitably fallen next. The Negro Camp
is so near the Cape, that the noifeof their firing
is heard every night. All the plantations, ex
cept one or two, are destroyed by the Negroes,
and on these they are conflantly making repeat
ed attempts.
Extratt of a letter from Cape-Francois, July 28.
u One of the government schooners brought
yesterday into our port a Spanish schooner, ta

had on board four guns, 4 pounders; seven t|iou
fand weight of powder, four hundred cutlafies,
and some muskets, which (he was conveying to
the rebel Negroes near the Cape.âThe Captain
was on shore treatingwith them; and the crew,
consisting of 3 men, have been put in prison."
Extrafl of a Utter from Fort-Knox (Vivcennes) dated
JÂ»it }5< >79 2 '
" I am afraid, my friend, that we {hall have
a very ugly job on hand, with this Indian war.
The Indians on this river are peaceable enough
with a great deal of watching and coaxingâ
they come in here very frequently, and appear
to have a great itch for fcalpingand plundering,
and nothing, I imagine, but their concern for
the prisoners we have, restrains them from tak
ing up the hatchet.
" A few days ago, several Chiefs came in
from Opec, a place high up on the Illinois river,
and, in their speech to Major Hamtramck, told
him they were frequently invited and threaten
ed by the Miami Indians to induce them to go
to war against us, but that they had not, nor
did intend to do it. That we must keep a good
heart, for we should have a great many more
to fight this year than we had the lastâwished
us success, and hoped we might give them a
good drubbing. The Major enquired whether
the Britilh made them any presentsâthey re
plied, that the Britifti gave them goods like
stacks of hay, provisions, arms, ammunition,
and every thing but big guns.
u Indeed, every intelligence we have receiv
ed from the Miami villages, corroborate so far
as to convince us that there will be double the
number of Indians in the field this year, there
was the last, and the British continue to supply
them with every thing they want; so that I
think a few of us will be apt to lose our hair."
F.xtraif? oj a Utter from Paris, June 11
The French nation will be free, in spite of
the number of difientions fomented even in
their aflembly, by the enemies to all liberty;
the greatest, and the far greatest part of the na
tion, being (launch to the constitution.
" I have been once to the National Aflem
bly, and was sorry to fee the want of order that
prevailed in the meeting of the representatives
of so formidable and powerful a nation as
France. Though there are many very emi
nent chara<sters among the members, it is easy
to perceive that they are divided into several
interests : some wifti to have entirely a repub
lic, others more power and more confidence in
the supreme executive ; and others (who are
the wisest) wish to preserve the constitution as
received and as eftabliftied : in fa&, some are
too moderate, and some too violent, and the
greatest diffidence exists, and not without rea
son, since the desertion of some men who had
even a great hand in the revolution : But not
zuit/ijldtiding all that, Liberty and the Rights oj Man
will pjevail."

u A number of youhg farmers (fays a cor
respondent) who are about to fettJe some new
land, would wi(h to be informed in a p6int that
immediately concerns them ; and on which, be
fore their removal, they would be glad to take
"opinions of their fellow-citizens j whether
a future Congress will perlevere in the fyftein;
of Britilh politics, and will, after the policy of
that nation, extend the Excise to Cider, Beer,
Candles, and other neceiiary articles in a fami
ly ? This question might, perhaps,with proprie
ty have been addrefied to those who have secret
ly influenced the measures of Congress, and who
are now exerting every nerve to fill the new
legislature with men devoted to avarice, and
who will humbly pursue every measure dictated
by their patrons."
As avarice is the basest pafHon that can dis
grace the character of our species, it is a molt
humiliating refle&ion that our public measures
should in this early period of our existence as a
nation, be controuled by men devoted to its in
fluence.âA correspondent observes on the a
bove paragraph from the u National Gazette"
âthat it conveys the mod audacious imputati
on on the character of the people, who elected
the members of Congrefcâit is little fliort of
faying that the freedom of ele&ion is rather a
curse than a blessingâBut who, enquires our
correspondent, are the men who Iwve made the
members o/Congrefs Hie tools of their avarice
âand who are the men that have thus fold
themselves to the worlhippers of mammon? Let
' their names be expoled that the people may
j know themâtill this is done, such inuendoes
can pass for nothing better than the suggestions
ofabafe mindâThe authors of insinuations
like the foregoing, cannot be considered as
friends of the people, of the union, or of the li
berties of this countryâThey may with pro
priety be ftiled incendiaries, who scatter fire
brands, arrows and death.
| Reason should govern one manâit should go
vern all menâit is opposed by pafTlon, which
'should not govern at all. When the enemies of
government address the pailions of the people,
as they inceflantly do, it is to prevent their be- j
ing governed by reafonâfor the government of j
! reason is fatal to party influence.
Perfect peace and tranquility arefeldom long
enjoyed by any society or communityâthe peo
ple of the United States appear to have the
most favorable profpedts that were ever pre
sented to the sons of men of a long series of en
ci-eafing happincfs-âbut there are men among
us who are determined to blast our hopes,
and to turn our glory into shame and contempt.
These eagle-eyed politicians are so iharp
fighted, that they can fee, as the man did thro'
the telescope, things out of fight. Nay, they
arrogate to themselves the attribute of omnis
cience, and judge not only of actions by their
falfe conceptions of things,but even of the hearts
of those who presume to have an opinion of their
own, different from their's.
It is said, that " the ambition and avarice of
some men are never to be fatisfied."âQue re,
whether those passions in any man or men, were
ever fatisfied ? But unfortunately for the coun
try, it is further said, " a few ambitious and
avaricious men, have been for some time bend
ing the whole power of the United States to
promote their private views of ambition and
wealth/'-âWhat a service would some men,
who are entirely diverted of these infernal pas
sions, render their country, by pointing outwith
their finger of scorn, these men of ambition and
avarice, who 4i ast as if they wished to bring
j the whole wealth and power of the country un
der their feet."âQue re, whether the " men
who have for some time been bending the whole
power of the United States," may not be said
to have it already fufficiently in their power to
put "it under their feet -Quere âWhat fort
of government is that where every law enadted
by the legislature thereof ought not to be obey
ed ?âQuere âWhat is Republicanism ?âWhat
a pity M'Fingal's opinion is not reducible to
pra&ice !
You (hall be vice-roys, it is true,
But we'll be vice-roys over you.
It is said, that " the civil wars of modern
Europe have been distinguished rot only by the
fierce anhnofity, but likewise by the obllinate
perseverance of the contending factions." Tne
lame remark will equally well apply to the civil
wars of every age and every countryâthe rea
son is obviousâpersonal animosities put a
keener edge on the spirit of resentment, and
the desire of revenge, than general quarrels be
tween different states, governments and king
domsâthe parties are likewise more fully ap
prized of the strength and refourcÂ«s of their re
fpciftive opponents âthis circumstance reduces
them to a point of nearer equality, and serves
to prolong the contest. Further, the parties
generally contend for life, farae and fortune ;
the unfortunate principals of either fide, always
falling facrifices to the vengeance of the victors.
It is a circumllance to be noted, that in molt
civil wars, the ostensible motives are similarâ
thus religion was the object in the civil wars of
France, which deluged that country in bloods or
near a century. The Protestant religion on
one fide, the Catholic on the other Aud if
Catharine, Empress of Germany, can excite a
civil war in Poland, the enemies of the revolu
on will probably fay, as well at its friends,
that Liberty is their object.

to what situation will you be reduced, who are

enable the company to underlell and ruin every

Will not the arbitrary and unjultifiable interference
of government in the private occupations of, citi
zens discourage young men trom acquiring the
knowledge of any occupation in which they may
be ruined by a combination of rich men enjoying
the particular patronage and protc&ion of govern
ment?
Nat. Gaz.
1 his fubjeft and ihefe questions merit your fc
rious attention. As yet you have the power in
your own hands, you ought to exert it to support
your rights.
It is the slavish do&rine of some men, " that
government has the whole property of citizens un
der its command, and that every law enacted by
(he legislature ought to be obeyed." No govern
ment on earth can be inveiled with power to vio
late those natural rightsof man, the prote&ion of
which is the sole objeÂ£t of the inftiiution of civil
lociety, thereiore, every attempt made by the le
giflatuie to destroy them, ought to be oppoied by
a free people.
1 he ambition and avarice of some men are ne
ver to be fahsfied. A few luch characters have
been for fon>e time bending the whole power of
the United States to piomote thtir own private
views ol ambition and wealth. Not content with
the honorable name of citizen, they wilh to in
troduce diitin&ion of rank ; not content with en
joying at their cafe every advantage whieh our
country can afford, or their wealth procure, they
desire to interfere in the occupations, and tocui
tail the enjoyments of their lellow-citizens. They
a6l as if they wished to bring the whole wealth
and power of the country under their feet. May
the early oppofniou of the People of America
to the unjufl meafuresof these deluded menâmay
the glorious and blessed light of the French revo
lution, aided by the writingsof the friendly clubs
in England, tend to convince them of their er
rors, and bring them to regard the rights of men
in every occupation, as sacred.

Mr. Fenno,
THE obje&ions to the law pasTed by ihc Lcgif
lature of New-Jeifey lor incorporating the lociety
inftitutcd for the promotion of Manufactures, con
taincd'in the above addrcfs, your readers may rr
j col jell to have seen in a performance signed Clitus,
which was publi(hed in the Gazette of the United
States about the time that the law was enacted.â
That speculation was firft printed in hand-billÂ«,and
circulated in that Stale previous to the pafling of
the law.âLet it be remembered that the establish
ment in New-Jersey is a State buftnefsâthat it is
not a national inftitutionâaud that the citizens of
that State are alone accountable for any confc
quences which may result from it.
It is to be presumed that the Lcgiflature of New-
Jersey knew what they were about when they
parted the ast of incorporation. Their conflitu
ents appear to think that the interefl of the State
has been consultedâand while the essential and
la fling advantage of the people can be more effeftu
aliy promoted by encouraging monied men to
combine their capitals, and come forward in un
dertakings, which, for want of funds, have never
yet flourifhed in this country âthe modcjl decla
mations, and the charitable imputations of no
disappointed partizan, will, I trull, have the least
effeaâunlefs, indeed, the declaimer happens not
to be a citizen of Nf w-Jersey.
