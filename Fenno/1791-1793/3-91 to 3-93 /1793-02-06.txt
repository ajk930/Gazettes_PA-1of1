BF.ING a lover of new fafliions, or rather
having a great dislike ro old faik'Ojpi ihat

fore lhai we are .like to drop ihc old hackney'd

of dirtintlionâfor it is equally Cortlnjon among
feivants as among theif ruaftcs. The word Ci
tizen has been proposed as a fubflitute for Mister;
t with great deference to their wisdoms wh<Â»
a/e making the change, I think this title for ge
neral use is somewhat exceptionable. The
word Citizen, which originated in RoimÂ«
was not formerly understood as conveying the
idea of Equality. The Noble and Patrician in
Rome, wqs not less a Citir.cn than the PieâbejjÂ»n,
though their refpts<ve ranks in focicty ueÂ«e
very different; Jmd between you and me, it hai
been fufpe&ed that oar yoang Nobility, called
Cincinnati, are defnous to intronuce rliis .'niient
title, with the hope that it may hereafter ftrve (0
cover antient orders rr diftm&ions. The tills
Citizen is not a good fubflitute for Miller, be
c a use it cannot be generally prefixed even to the
names oi refpeftable petfons. How fbould we
addr fs a man jutl arrived from England or Ire
land ? He is not a Citizenâand we cannot wjih
any fort of propriety call him Master. Snppofc
the man to be addrefled wjÂ»s just arrived from
Spain or Portugal, the difficulty would not be
removed, 'f he fubjeft of thole kingdoms i* not
a Citizen, nor is he a free man, and to Call him
Â» fl<fcÂ»e, might' poflibly accord with truth, but
aot v ith gohd manners.
If the fuMlitnte for Mister is to be eorfidered
as a mark of afff&ion, perhaps we (ball find tfiat
Brother is more proper than Citizen, for it
may fairly be applied to men oi any countly ;
and this mode of addiefs is already adopted by
the Savages, who are perfeÂ£Uy free. It njuft
howevei be admitted, that by the indifenmitjatt
use of the appellation Brother, we lofethc name
by which we now diilmguifh a near and gene
rally a dear relation. It alio be admitted
that the title Brother cannot well be applied to
more than half of the fpceies.
f . I am ready to declare that I do not admire
flattering titles, nor titles which cannot be in
general ufc without the risque of p'vipg offmcr
or departing fiom truth ; and lor this reason, 1
would submit the propnety of the title
Biped instead of Milter. This titlfc is perfectly
simple ; it fits people of evety country; it is
male or female ; it is not of afiftocratic origin ;
it may eafilv be abbreviated on the face of a
letter ; and while it fully accords with truth, it
can never bear the suspicion of fla'tery. At pie
fent there are cufes in which, tor the fake of
greater refpeft, we vary the common address.
Thus, instead of Sir, we fay Deal Sir. In like
manner, when the new title thaJl be.adoptrd,
instead of Biped J. PÂ« we may fayÂ« Biped Citizen
]. P.âBut as every body knows that J, P. is a
hiped and a Citizen, it inay be quelkionrd wheÂ«
ther either of those appellations, those pleonasms,
those truisms, can be of any use prefixed to his
name on the face of a letter, or in common par*
Certainly they are of no useâand after
we (hall have indulged in a variety of whims, we
may pcflibly discover that the molt proper and
dignified ioim of address is that winch was in
use among .the annents. and is in common uft;

again into the hereditary states, the emperor
has refolvetl not to tax the provinces, nor to

Tbe artillery which fervcd in the siege of

We (hall certainly do credit to the French
Generals, a* we promised, in praising the bra
very of their conduct in the late action before
M in-, wliicli was one of the mod bloody and
well fought battles that modern times can
l'urnilh us an example of. Indeed it is the
only aftlon of consequence wliieh has happen-
Ed during the prcfent war
The French Generals and soldiers have
gained themselves immortal military honors
in this ast ton ; not that the Auftrians* per
haps, deserve it less than their opponents for
both parties fought most bravely ; but the
French were more in numbers, and their ar
tillery, perhaps thefineft in Europe was much
better ordered. A ' ,
What may be the event of this battle it is
impossible to foretell, but we have too much
reft fan to apprehend that the whole country
of Brabant will become a conquest to the
French. It will not however be pnfillani-
moufly delivered up, for we are $;iven to un
derstand, that the Duke de Saxe Tefchen was
determined to dispute every inch of ground
with the French, and accordingly had taken
a strong post at La Halle, two leagues only
from BrulTels, where he intended to make a
nother stand.
Neither Mons nor Tonrnay are places or
any strength, nor were they capable of mak
ing refinance. Both places have been long
iince dismantled of their tortifications.
Mous, which is situated 26 miles S. E. 01
Brufl'eU, was dismantled in the year 174&, af
ter being re (to red by the French at the trea
ty of Aix la-Chapel!e.
Tournay was dismantled of its fortificati
ons in 1745, while it was in potfefiion of the
French, who took it after the famous battle
of Fontfnoy. This city was also restored to
the Aufti ians at the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
The or.lv places of ilrength in the Austrian

saulting a fherifPs officer in the execution of
his duty, and rescuing the (aid Lynam ofClon
tarf, the fec.ond of O&ober ; also, for a rjot
and aifanlt on Denirs Maden.
This trial disclosed a fubjcdl worthy thefe
rious attention of government. It appeared,
in the course of it, that a colony of French
Jacobins have taken up their quarters at
Clontarf, and are laboring, by every art and
industry, to inspire the townsmen with dil'af
fe&ion to the laws and constitution of the
country.
On this occasion, Potain, a Frenchman,aid-,

mob and rescued Lynam out of the hands of
the bailiff, (who had arretted him for debt)
and carried him off in triumph, exclaiming

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF RtPREStNI'ATIVES.
Monday, January 28.
The Eill to author,ix a Loan in the Notes
or Certificate s of&e several Stater which,
on a final Settlement of Account' flail have
a Balance due to them f'out the United
Statesâhaving been read the third timeâ
the Quefien, Ml the Bill pals ? -was
put by tie Speaker :
Mr. Page having moved the previous que
(lion, said, that in consequence of his aver
sion to wade the time of the Houfc, which
he always regarded as precious, he generally
waited for the question, without troubling the
House with his reasons for his vote ; always fa
tisfied, if what occurred to him in support of it
was offered by any other member, who might
be better heard and understood but that ,
when the names of the voters were to be held
up to the public view, and when the vote he
meant to give had been represented, by some
members for whom he had the highest refpe&>
as injurious to public creditors, as retrofpe&ive,
and therefore unconstitutional in its operation,
he thought himfelf bound to endeavour to juf
tify his vote.
If the creditors, Mr. Speaker, who are the
objed of the bill before you, were, by the
amendment, excluded from an application to
their debtor ; or, were the general govern
ment the only body to whom they could look
for payment or common justice, 1 would moll
scrupulously avoid interfering with their claims;
or did the bill extend its influence to all the
creditors of the slates impartially, I might
listen to some obje&ions which have been
made to a discrimination, said to be produced
by the amendment. But, Sir, granting all that
has been objected to have its full force, I only
find, that such creditors of creditor states (for
no others are to be benefited by this bill) as
may not be able to eftablilh their claims found
ed on a speculation, which was grounded on
a supposition that this bill would pass, without
the amendment now proposed, will only be left
where they are; and where, in my opinion,
they ought to be left, that is, to look to their
orignal contradt ; and I do not contribute to
seduce them from their attachment to their state
and from their reliance on its plighted faith.
I wiih net zo fee them deluded into an accept
ance of four per eent. interest from the general,
government of the United States, instead of lix
from their refpe&ive states, which, I believe,
are willing and able to comply with their en
gagements. But, Sir, if I were even an advo
cate for the affumptlon, and for the complicated
funding system, I Ihould vote for the amend
ment, now proposed ; because I think with my j
colleagues, Madison and Giles, and the member
from Maryland, Mercer, that it is not only well
calculated to prevent an improper scramble a
mongst speculators for the supposed 1 enefit of
the bill, but is proper to rel'cue the members of
Congress from temptation as well as irom sus
picion of fpeculatmg on their own laws. I there
fore think, Sir, 1 can honellly and confcienti
ouily vote for the amendment.
Whilst I am up, said Mr. Page, I will take
the liberty of remarking, that those gentlemen
arho ib loudly and warmly replied to the mem
ber from Maryland, and supposed they were
vindicating the honor of the House, in my opi
nion were greatly mistaken : their condu<ft
tended to check free debate and bold inveftiga
tion,and their remarks refpu&ing newspaper
information, might be a dangerous check to
the freedom of the press.
What avails, said he, the declaration of our
conftitution,refpe<fting the freedom, of the press,
if it may be restrained by the condu6t of mem
bers in either House of Congrefa ? And, surely,
it may be restrained by such remarks as have
been so warmly made by members here, mere
ly on a member's stating information in his
place, andrefering to newspapers for further
confirmation ; bold must be t)ie printer, and on
a broad basis of a large fubfeription must he
stand, who can repeat information so leverely
quoted in this House. The honor of the House
can never be vindicated by such expreilions; on
the contrary, they may lead our conftituentsto
suppose, that at least paflions prevail here, and
animosities exist, which ought to have no place
amongst us; and, indeed, such conduct may
tend dire<sMy to produce consequences of a seri
ous nature to members concerned in debate.
(Delate to he continued.)
IVrdnrsdat, January 30.
In committee of the wnoleâon the bill to a
mend the ad to promote the progress of ufeful
arts Mr. Steele in the chair.
The motion offered by Mr. White, the pur
port of which âtw amend the firft fe&ion, by
flriking out what fetats to the Dire&or of ther
Mint, and inserting a clause which provides for
the appointment of an officer to be denominated
the Dirc&or of Patents, âwas further considered.
Mr. Livermore objecting to the form of the
amendment as indirectly providing for a new
eftablilhment,
Mr. White withdrew his motion, and offered
the following, in substance, in lieu of it.
That an office (hall be cltablifhed for the pur
pose of granting patents, vesting in the authors
of ufeful inventions and discoveries the exclusive
right to their inventions an J discoveries. Said
office to be under the dire&ion of an officer to be
denominated
Mr. Livermore Hiid, !.e TlVed this motion be*
taufe it brought the object dire&ly before the
committee. This otytCl, however, be iifiikcd
it founded like a provision for granting
dollars pet annum ; a found which he wji Â»).
ways averse to. He was altogether in favour of
devolving the bofinefs ou feme officer alread â¢
appointedthe Secretary of State he raen:ion
ed as a proper officer to fupei intend this bufincf,"
Mr. Page laid he ffiould not agree to thr J
mendment if hi? thought a fa'ury would be the
consequence. He supposed that provilion R' -h
be made for the officer without recuiriug i 0 j
falaty ; he alluded to fees from she patrntecs
He objected to devolving the bufincl'son the of
(tier of the Mint, or of the Secretary of Su>e
as interfering with the eflentwl duties of those'
officers; and though the gentlemen at prefcot
in those office* are abundantly qualified to exe-
cute the duty, yet it may happen that peif,,ai
may hold those appointment:, at ioine future
time, not qualified for this particular lervkc.
Mr. Murray observed, that the amendment
contemplated, the appointment of vie officer on-
ly, and that to be fixed at the feat of govern
ment. He suggested several confiderotioni io <
favor of inverting the judges of the Diftrift
Courts with the power of granting patents in
the several dates, for the greater accoiuinodj.
tion of the citizens, and the more exteufive en-
couragement of genius.âHe was in iav>r of giv
ing greater facility to the ifluing of patents,
than has hitherto been considered as advifabLe.
Mr. White laid he thought the gentleman'*
idea would not do, as patents might beiffued ia
the different partfc or extremes of .the Union for
the fame invention.
Mr. Murray said that he conceived a remedy
for this inconvenience might eafriy l>e devised.
Mr. Boudinot said, that one great obje&ioa
to the present mode of obtaining patent > was,
the great delay and expence Incurred by thÂ« ap.
plicSUits in being obliged to wait till the officer#
now empowered to decide on applications, could
find leisure, from the special duties of their offi
ces, to attend to them.âWith reiped to devolv
ing the duty on the Judges, he hoptd that would
not be done; as it wonld be found, judging from
the engagements of the Dillri& Judge of Penn
sylvania, that they could not pofÃbly attend to
the business.
Mr. Baldwin obje<fted generally to anv a
mendment which (hould provide for theiuftitu
tion of a new department. His opinion was,
that no officÂ« fliould be created till there was an
absolute necessity for it.âHe entered intoa brief
confidcration of the fubje&, and attempted to
shew that the business might with ease and con
veniency be attended to by some officer already
appointed.
Mr. Williamfon, adverting to the principle!
of the bill, said it was an imitation of the patent
fyftefti of Great Britain ; that the provilionj
were such as would cirtumfcribe the duties of
the deciding officer within very narrow limits;
the fettlemcnt of disputes arising from conteiled
claims, will devolve on referees altogether.â
He was decidedly oppofod to a new
department âexpence to the government would
be the inevitable consequence.
The queftiononMr. White's motion was ne
gatived.
Mr. Murray then moved to strike out lf Di
rector of the Mint," and to insert the name of
the Diftrid Judge in which the party applying
for the patent relides. The reason, he observ
ed, which induced him to make this motion
was, the total diflimilarity between the circum
stances of tlii# country and those of Great Bri
tain, where it is thought efiential to have but
one officer to issue patents. That country is one
entire kingdomâ-ifluing patents is a pieroga
tive bufinefs âLondon is one great mart of ge
nius, enter prize and profit; which makes it a
proper center to attraifl every man who mean#
to profit by his inventions. In this country,
there are fifteen governments, sovereign in
thtf mfelves for ccrtain purposes ; the citizens are
generally situated at a great diftante from the
feat of government; the expence and inconve
niency of coming from the remote parts of the
Union, to take out patents, operate as a great
discouragement to men of genius in low or me
dfittn circumllances.âThe only obje&ion which
had been urgad against the proportion, is that
arising from conflicting patents being issued.â
This difficulty he thought could be obviated; pa
tents are matters of record ; this would afford
the means of detedlion, but if some partial in
conveniencies ftiould aaife, they would be more
than counterbalanced by the facility afforded to
the citizens to obtain what, in this country,
they have an undoubted right toâthe benefits
of their inventions.
Mr. Williamfon offered a few obje&ious to
this motion, the queflion on which being taken,
it was negatived.
On morion of Mr. Sedgwick, " Dire&or ot
the Mint" was ilruck out, and Secretary of Slat*
infer ted. (
Mr. White moved an amendment by way o
proviso, the purport of which is, to preclude t e
inventor of an improvement to a machine fro* l *
using the original invention, or the author o
the original machine from using the improve
ment. This motion, after some oppofit on,was
agreed to.
Mr. Williamfon moved an amendment to the
second feftion, which provides that the requite
oath, or affirmation, may be taken before a jT
Judge of the United States, or of any particular
state, or any person authorized to admim
oath in the place where the applicant relides.-
Agreed to. j
Mr. Williamfon propofetl another amen â¢
ment, which fliould vest a discretionary
in the officer to dispense with the pr 1
of a model wheu he fliould think proper

The folfpujing oh [ovations of that great avd en
lightened patriot and fiatejman, Mr. Pitt, the
present prime Minijler of C seat-Britain, are wor
thy of the attention of every Jriendto the consti
tution of the United States, and the honor and
Jrcedom of this happy country
The peculiar circumftanccs to which the
National prosperity is ascribed by Mr. Pitt
are, the natural industry and energy of the
country ; the improvements made in many
branches of manfa&ure ; the invention and
application of machinery, by which labour has
been abri Iged, and the great degree of credit
which our merchants are enabled to obtain ;
to these he further adds, the exploring and
enterprifmg spirit of Britons, and the con
stant accumulation of capital, which, contin
ually incteafing at compound interest, ads
with a velocity continually accelerated, an' 3,
in times of tranquility, has scarcely any ii
t> its operation.
" Such are the circumstances which," fays
Mr. Pitt, " appear to me to have contributed
molt immediately to our present prosperity ;
but these again are connected with others yet
more important.
" They are obviously and necelTarily con
nected with the duration of peace ; the con
tinuance of which, 011 a secure and perma
nent footing, must ever be the firft objeift of
the foreign policy of this country. They ale
connected (till more with its internal tran
qui ity, arid with the natural effects of a free
but well rejulated government.
" What is it which has produced, in the
last hundred years, so rapid an advance be
yond what can be traced in any other period
in our history ? What but that, during that
time, under the mild and just Government of
the illustrious Princes of the family now on
the Throne, a general calm has prevailed
through the country, beyond what was ever
before experienced ; and we have also enjoy
ed, in greater purity and perfection, the be
nefit of those original principles of our Con
stitution, which were ascertained and efta
blilhed by the memorable events that closed
the century preceding. This is the great
and governing cause, the operations ot which
has given scope and effect to all the other cir
cuinftances.
" It is the Union of Liberty with Law,
which, by raising a barrier equally firm against
encroachments of power, and the violence of
popular commotion, affords to property its
j nft security, produces the exertion of genius
and labour, the extent and solidity of" credit,
the circulation and increase oi a capital
which forms, and upholds the national cha
racter, and let* in motion all the springs which
actuate the mass of the community through
all its various descriptions.
" The laborious industry of the peasantry
and yeomanry of the country ; the Ikill and
ingenuity of the artificer ; the experiments
and improvements of the wealthy proprietor
of land j the bold speculations and fuccefsful
adventures of the opulent merchant and en
terprising manufacturer ; these are all to be
traced to the fame source, and all derive
from hence both their encouragement and
their reward. On this let
us preserve this firft and moll effeutial okjctf,
and every other is in oiir power ! Let us re
memtvr that the love of the constitution,
though it arts as a fort of natural inftinft in
the hearts of Englilhmen, is strengthened by
reason and reflection : that it is a Constitu
tion which we do not merely admire from
traditional reverence, which we do not flat
ter from prejudice or habit, but which we
cheriili and value, because we know that it
praaically secures the tranquility and wel
fare both of individuals and of the public ; and
provides beyond any other frame of govern
ment, for the real and ufeful ends, which
form at once, the cnlv true foundation and
only rational object of all political Societies-
