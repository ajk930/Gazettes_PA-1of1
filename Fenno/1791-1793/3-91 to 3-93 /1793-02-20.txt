for tht GAZETTE of the UNITED STATES,
jyfr. FEMN'-O,
I fend you a few thoughts on the slate of our Ameri
ca* Indiansâif they are calculated to inffrire more
jujt or benevolent Jentiments refpetting them, by
irtfert.ng them in your Gazette, you will oblige
your humble fervanty Lycurgus.
"[VyJ OTWITHSTANDING the Tfngth
' time tftat has elapsed since the di r covej"y
of ttiis Countryâthe number and success of
the emigrants, and the rapid growth and im
provement of the settlements, little or no at
tention has been paid to the melioration of
the state of the natives of the foil.-âWe are
indeed acquainted with the real
state of manners among themâThe remarks
which have hitherto been made upon the fub
jeft are too few and detached, too informal
and extravagant to fatisfy an enquiring mind
âThe accounts which have been published,
have generally been derived from trade- r^a rfcl
travellers whc
and have not had Jeifure or talents for nrcu
rate observation. From the small progress
which the Indians have made in improvement,
an opinion has arisen and is current among a
certain class of citizens, that tiipy are incapa
ble of civilizationâAn idea so injurious to
the feelings of benevolence, so inconsistent
with the powers of the human mind and the
ftrongefl: propenfiti.es of human nature, ar.d
so direc'Hy contrary to the progress of savage
manners in past ages, null be well fuppoi ted
to merit our alfent.
This incapacity of the Indians if any fnch
exists must arise front Ibme imbecility either
of body or mind, but that no such infirmity
can with justice be ascribed to them, the uni
form tefiimony of all who have beeortie ac
quainted with them fufiiciently evinces.
In their persons and complexions like all
other nations they arefubjeftto those minute
variations which climate, njode of living, po-
delicacy of food and the eaie or dif
ficulty of acquiring it contributed to create.
They are generally tolerably well njade, tall
luiy â¢f-'Ntoll) j they
are remarkably active in war and in the choce
âcapable of enduring the greatest hardships
and fafigtjes ant} in an astonishing degree in
sensible of iuclement seasons.âThe women
fuffer very Jittle from the pains of child birth
âthey need no a (Usance but from nature and
their own crtriilitrttidns, and are confined but
a few hours from their usual employments â
They have generally good health without any
precautions topreferve ir, and are strangers
to many rfifeafes which afflidt polished nations.
The powers of their minds are in no refpeft
inferior to the qualities of their bodies J they
discover great sagacity in those things with
which their circumstances re mice them fa
miliar ; they are able to perceive with incre
dible facility the traces of man or bead-*
" on the smoothest grass, on the hardest earthy
and even on the very stones will they difcovqr
the traces of an enemy, and by the shape of
the footfteps and the distance between the
prints distinguish ndt only whether it is a man
or woman who has palled that way, but even
the nation to which they belong."
LIC.
They will cross a trackless fore ft cf im
mense ejtteot without any material deviation
from the .place at which they aifned ; they
will point to the place of the fun though in
tercepted by jclouds, and dire ft their
with furprifidg exaftnefs bv a nice attention
to minute circupittances whichefcape the no
tice. rf more imprtwed people.
The habit si'relying upon their memories
for the knowledge of past tranfaftions, with
the artificial means they use to ftrengt'ien the
principle of association, render them furprif
iflgly retentive.
Their language, correspondent to their
ideas, is narrow and (irapleâmany of their
speakers, how;ever f have arrived at confidcri
able eminence, a greater fluency of words and
grace ofaCtion than could be ex
pelled from a people ignorant? of the arts and
faiences, and all thofij terms to which improv
ed fpciety gives birthâTheir speeches arc ge
nerally bold and nervousâfu l l of striking im-
and fonietimes truly lublime. The qua
lities of the mird ai d body give rank and dis
tinction among them âThe Sachems whopre
fide in their councils and direst the affairs of
the tribe, derive their influence wholly from
the opinion which the nation entertains of
their wifdoin and integrityâTheir leaders in
war also owe their authority to the public es
timation of their courage and condu<stâAs a
further proof of their mental qualifications,
I might mention the proficiency of such of
them as have enjoyed the means of inflec
tionâit has generally been equal to the must
sanguine expectationsâtheir rude attempts
at the arts are curious and discover great in
genuity and inventionâTo these may be ad
ded thair magnanimity, their hospitality, and
their fidelity to their friendsâvirtues in
which they are unparalleled by civilised na
tions.

From the American Daily Advertiser
MR. DUN LAP,
SUNDRY observations, which have ap
peared in Mr. Fenno's paper, deserve no
tice, as they tend to impress our
brethren with an idea, that fa&ion and party
have transfufed them/elves from individuals,
into the northern States themtelves.
The southern members of Cangrefs are ral
!.=~, as having instituted an enquiry into the
State of the public funds, for the purpose of
exhibiting an alHimed integrity over thole of
the north, who have not been, as may be in
ferred from the paiagraph, active in, or in
deed approving of the meafui e.
And the agricultural interell have their at
tention very seriously called, to the favor
(hewn them, "in not being called tn by the col
lector for the fruits oj their labour."
In the fijft paragraph, raillery is reforwd to,
for the purpose of fupprefling or diftqbnte
nancing fin equirv, made fundamental hy the
coaAitution in the following clause : ** No,
money (hall be drawn from the Treasury, but'
in roofequence of appropriations made by
law; and Â® regularftafement and account of
the receipts and expenditures of all public
money, shall be published from time to time."
lfinefs,
And in the second, a gross fraud is inculca
ted for a truth. Both are calculated to nur
ture faftinn and party.
It would be well for the landed and labor
ing people of America to corf-der what this
party is, and whalv it ought to be.
With rcfpeft to what it is
A inonied interest, amazed at the extent
:uid brilliancy of its acquisitions, so wonder,
ful as to excite apprehenfionj as to their fafe
tv, are governed by the following principles .
I ft. To encreafe the public debt by every ar
tifice, for the pnrpoie of enlisting more
troops, armed with money, which is power.
2d. To difrountenance enquiries into public
funds, and economy in their management,
as obftrufting their deligns.
3d. To strengthen their party, by
northern and southern interest, opposed to
f ct'ior, between state?, wnicti have, in
a common interest.
4th. To efleft a silent, tho'fundamental revo-
Inrion, by transferring the national influ
ence over the Legislature, to a monied in-
tereft in the hands of a few individuals.
sth. And finally, to ere ft a monarchy or aris
tocracy, to restrain the deceived majority,
Ihould tliey ever recover their understand
ings.
With refpeft to what it ought to be :
The party ought to coniift of the monied
intereftonly, because their designs and prin
ciples are clearly in opposition to the landed
and labouring interests of all denominations.
These, in order to preserve their liberties
ought;
id. To eeonomifc the public revenues.
2d. To pay the debt as fact as pofiible.
3d. To watch over the public resources, and
apply them in the njoft beneScial mode*
This arrangement of parties is cunningly
elucbd by foftering separate interests between
the States ; by persuading the laboring clafles
that the taxes favor them ; and, by a series
of newfp2per paragraphs and correfponderi
cies, written by speculators, who have mo
ney and leisure for futh performances, and
who had 1 athjr write than work for a liveli
hood.
The monisd ihtereft is a kind of flying
squadron, whole objedt is to divide the great
mafjof the people, by a geographical line,
and ta cajole one division, that they may live
at free quarter on the labor of both.
Hence it would be well for the people to
consider,
jft. Whether an attempt topcrfuade them,
that thejrdo not pay tiixes, is not a dehifion !
Are taxes any thing, except labor ? If the
merchant pays a tax on his coat or mine, mult
not labor ultimately reimburse him? Is not
this deluiion designed to lull the agricultural
and mechanical interests into fecnrity, and to
blunt their enquiries concerning the disposi
tion of the taxes ?
2d. Whether those who pay, or those who
receive, are mod likely to search into the dif
pofitian of public money ? and how far this'
principle will apply, refpedively, to the con
dlift of those members of Congress, who en
courage or embarrass such an enquiry ?
34. Whether fifcal perplexities are not cal
culated to keep them i:i ignorance as to the
disposition of their money? Whether ignor
ance is not a good foil, in which to plant di-f
---potifm ? And whether they have had a plain
and finiple statement of the public funds,
from the e(UbliihÂ»nent of the government to
tfcisday?
For my part, it fecms to me, that all the
landed and labouring classes of citizens, in all
the States, have one common intcreft, and
that nothing but wooden men, will fuflpr
theinfelves to be played off like puppets, by
newspaper paragraphs, for Che emolument of
fellows behind the curtain.
[Whole No. B.]
For the GAZETTE of the UNITED STJTEi
IT is too easily conceded that a [Teat ciamor
is always a proof of fomethiug being wrong.
We have men whose trade it is (a meaner and
blacker tradethan chiinney-fweeping) to make
as mtlch noise as they can aiainft government
âfor what the people's servants doâfor what
they neglelt to doâfor the thoughts of otir
rulers hearts, /which these imps pretend to
know) all, all is wrong. Not a finale good
thing has been done of intended. The fame
men are chosen over and over againâw'.ich
looks something like popular confidence in
their integrity. Generally speaking they are
not richâfar from itâthey mult fink or fwini
with the people they represent. Their pri
vate characters stand too, as well as can be
said of any body of men. Our dealers in
lamp-black, however, goon with their work ;
and it is aflerted by themfelvc?, with no fmaU
joy, that they have at Jaft got the govern
ment to look, when seen from the fonth, at
black as a (hip's bottomâA certaiu Gazette
Jerves as their tar-kettleâlt is trumpeted
twice a week ; who would have thought our
new governmentâour bright-sided conftitnti
on would so fo*n have got into this trinW?
It is time to fink her for a hulk. Again they
cry why does not Corigrefs attend to rhe
voice of the people ? There is great difcori
tent ( They might add, we are hire there is,
for we made it. There is nothing these peo
ple cannot fay, and there is no which
cannot be Hedinto some discredit* Sons 6f
mifchlef take arj example, as follows :
The rage sos innovation is rather a
er than a reformer. The excellent trial by
jury is the better as well as the fafer for, it*?
being ancient. It has'(lowly improved, and
time has made it justly venerable. It Is
scarcely poflible that any new plan could be so
perfect in its firft conftruftion as this mode of
trial. Yet it would lie one of the easiest things
in the world to (hew from theory how d*feÂ£-
tive it is. Our levellers could turn out a set
of ready cut and dry, at a mo
ments warning, to (hew that it is nnconftitri
tiOn?ri,- dangerous atld <\KgfgT-etuTTtTir free
confffVf They mipfht T*eTTow from their Ga
zette ; with r. very /light change of here and
there a word, the old ftorf would do. Twelve
men are de r pots. Lords of our lives and pro
perties. Our imprescriptible and unalienable
rights are alienated, trucked off and put into
their hands as pawn-brokers, to be delivered
back or not as they may think properâWe
must take them, damaged or found, clean or
dirty, as they come from these new made
lords, our fnafters hands. What abfurdfty.
Trufttjueftions of fcienee to ignoranceâmake
folly a cafu ftâa(k them to tell, and with ex
adtnefs, what they dp nor know tliemfelvC?.
What a chance for prejudice, partiality and
corruption. Rrch men will buy 12 men, as
often as they hive octafiorr, and thus oppress
the poor under the color of law. Mens rights
will be usurped, and jnfHce turned into a
mockery. Freemen, will ye bear this ? will
ye bow youf rtecks to this tyrannyâto this
project for nnking lords by the dozenâto
this fair for the fate of conscienceâthis ex
port and import trade of corruption. It was
not so in 1775âThen the people judged by
their committee). Power was Jcepf in the
hands which have a right to hold it. Par ike
people are the f>untain of powerâthe true
sovereigns of* America !
There is not a word of truth in all
flourifh, and yet, if juries were now iiift ef
tablilhed by a law ofGongre-fs, we (bould have
every word trumpetted in our ears by thjÃ
falfe friends of liberty and the people.
Mr. Fenno,
It is obffrved that you have been liberal in your pub>
lie alio* s of remarks tefpefting the mover of the re
folutipns of the flbtfe'of RepresentativesÂ» requir
ing a cUvelopement of the realjlate of the Treasury
âIt is reauejltd, as the only atonement, that you
re-print the endoftd piece faucd Frankitn, and
any other which maxferveio present to the public
v tewy a fair jialement oj the quejlion on both Jides.
THE appeal made to the public by the Se
cretary of the Treasury in his reraoo
ftrance of February the 4th, against the reso
lutions ofCongrefs for information relative
to the (late of the fund?, teems with indicati
ons to attract the public attention.
Though it be overlooked that griat delay
was incurred in prep ring and tranfinitting
this performance to London,whilft thefelTion,
and the investigation were porting rapidly to
an end ;
Though nothing is asked touching this foH
citude and anxiety, to keep up the price ol
Hock and certificates in a foreign country ;
Though the indelicacy ofprinting the paper
in hand-bills, and in circulating it without
the permiflion of Congress, is admitted- to be
no infringement of the Constitution ;
Yet the ijpirit and Bavour of the piece
ought to receive that free inveftigation,wiucb
it solicits by its own example.
A FAEMER.
The palitict of such of our representatives
A FAG SIMILE.*t cotrotenanw tt>e enquiry into tl* state tf
the public resources, have been often branded
with the epithet of antifeclcra). And this ap
pellation hath been liberally |*ftowcd upon
them by the fifcal faction.
It is of importance to the community to
know, to whom this epithet in truth belongs.
The cry it no criterion by which to judge.
Tne perpetrator of a feleny, it usually more
vbcifGr.ius in his exclamations than his pur
faers themselves.
The constitution eaafts, Â« that a regular
(tateineiit and accouut of Iht nctipn and ixpeti
diturts of public *Â«0 shall be puhlilhedlrom
time to time." An account of public monies
and funds rs here explicitly directed by * con
stitutional mandate. Can it be imagined.that
the only individual capable of complying with
k, and actually provided bylaw as the instru
ment for it, is the only individual entitled to
â¢11 absolution from the injunction ?
The Secretary admits that this account
hath never been produced, but aflerts, " that
until the last resolutions, no coll has been made
upen him, which rendered it proper to exhi
bit a general view of the public monies and
funds." He is deaf to the voice of the con
stitution, although in this instance its lungs
*re exerted in the loudest and mofl articulate
tone.
Such accounts were designed as a check,
and do certainly militate powerfully again It
monarchy and ariftocfacy ;
ftrjl. By counteracting corruption, and
money-influence of every kind in the legilla
ture.
Secondly. By producing (economy, leflening
taxes, and diminilhing the number of tax-j,a
therers, whose interest geneially unites them
With administration.
Thirdly. By obviating the acquirement of
exorbitant wealth, from the temporary use of
public money. ' â¢ '
Is the genius of thÂ« constitution monarchi
cal or republican ? Who are most federalâ
thoft who join their voice to the call of the
constitution, or those who are deaf to this
fundamental remonftrante !âLet the impar
tial judge. The apology of the Secretary in
its best view, is an acknowledgement that he
has been guilty of a fupprelfion, in violation
of the constitution.
But it is proper to enquire, whethar this
fupprelfion has been accidental o,r I'yftematiQ ?
âIf the former, a plain, placid, intelligible
statement of the public funds may be expect
ed. But if a system hath been conflicted by
the enquiry, passion, artifice, perplexity, will
be resorted to in its defence.
Let a fcfolift in politics and human nature,
refleCt on the following indications of this let
ter, and doubt if he can, whose image and lu
perfcription it bears.
It feleCte the indiviflual member, who mov
ed for th* enquiry into the state of the Trea
sury, at the objeCt of newfpiper animadyerfi
â¢ii } although the tacit breacli of the constitu
tion by the Setretary, and the rejection of a
propofitfon of like import at the preceding
fellion, Confpiied in stimulating him to do Ms
duty.
It is in theftile of a remonstrance from a
constituent, who " acjuicfces in tie fujficierty oj
motivesbut yet censures the ast itlelf.
It censures the reasons leading to the reso
lutions ] it admits of the fufficiency of the
motives inducing the refolutiens ; it censures
the resolutions as requiring an impracticable
compliance ; it still promises to perform this
impracticability; and having easily effected
it, boasts of a success, which " must obviate
every idea of a balance unaccounted for."
What is this but one tissue of contradiHion ?
It amuses people, by a labored explanation
of an ingenious contrivance, by which two
millions may be turned and turned, until the
result isâo.
It endeavors to change tlie objeCt of enqui
ry, by soliciting the public attention to an
examination of the accuracy of a conjectural
statement:
And it concludes with an injunction upon
the members ofCongrefs to wait upon his of
ficers for information, left their enquiries
(hould turn out to he iiifignificant, especially
iffnujHted upon a " voluntary difdojure" of the
Secretary himfelf.
The motives and ''ffeCts of theft indicati
ons, deserve some portion of the public atten
tion.
What member of Congnefs wilt in future
move for a " Jlatement oj the receipts and expen
ditures of pui/ic money," if be is to be dragged
into a newspaper controversy, and expoled to
the odium and abu Â« of tlw paper feftion, set
on-hy the matter of the pack?
When Cotigrefs itfelf isaccofted in a mÂ«-
jefteria! stile of condef'cention (if the expreffi.
on is allowable) does it not evince a reliance
upon foine hidden influence ? Especially should
Congress {hi ink from its own ast, and surren
der at discretion one of its own members) as
a hostage for their future good behaviour.
Are not contradictions, and uninteresting
transmutations of fifcal entries, indicative of
a design to deceive and mislead ?
Is not the attempt to detach the public eye
from its tme obieft, fulpjcious I The Jure
often decoys a whole flock of pigeons from
their f'afe line of progress, into the net of the
merc'fefs sportsman. And is not an attempt
to avoid public enquiries, by a reference of
individual members tofifcal officers, designed
to continue the p'efent darkness of the pub
"llc mind, as to the knowledge of public funds ?
Fellow citizens, piece these circumstances
together, and extract the result for your
felvts.
Democracy delights in public knowledge
âSimplicity ought to be the garb of her fifcal
arrangementsâwith inviolability (be reveres
and fulfills the constitution, because it is the
will of the peopleâShe is jealous of the inde
pendence of the legislature, collectively and
individuallyâShe abhors artifice, perplexity,
and intrigueâwith alacrity and pcrfpicuity
flie gives an account of her conductâand Jh'e
exhibits public funds in doilari and cent*. for
erery palTenger to view.
A contrary coniiuft cannot be tlie effect of
accident; it is the result of political f/fteijl,
and ignorance itfelf, unblinded by inteÂ»Â»fl,

" IN free governments, where men enjoy the

of fcntimcnt refpe&ing public men and meafurrs

This d'yerfity however, is attrnded with good Or
bad effeftt, according to the principle from
which it If the agent be an honrft and
candid enquirer, it his object be truth and in
formation, he will be ever open to convictionâ
and,, when convinced, will think it no dishonor
to retra& and acknowledge his error. But on
the contrary, if his mind be darkened by preju

party spirit, his opinion, however erroncoufly
formed, no course of reasoning nor of facts can
induce him td forego. He may be refuted, but
will be convinced ; truth mav dazzle him
by its brightness, bu* will nevÂ«r eradiate or cheer.
To attempt conri&ion under such circumftanees,

FLATTERING as it may be to the hu

To enlarge the sphere of social happiness is
worthy the benevoJent design of a Masonic

hundred and sixty geese, fold in the market of
this town ; and the day before Chriflmas, twelve
hundred turkies, and upwards of fix hundred

COMMUNICATIONS.
Mirabeau has told us in the National GuzetU,
what arc theyÂ»rerunners of Monarchy and Aris
tocracy. Condorcet, in a subsequent Gawtte,
has added some after-runners. The latter sup
poses that the pure spirit of that deified faint,
Mirabeau, who, every body knows, hated vice
all his life long, and who died a martyr to it,
as fame tells us, that chaste, sober patriot foul,
from the region appointed for such fort of peo
ple, looks down on the United States with patft
and sorrow to fee the vices they indulge in, and
the dangers that await them. They intimate,
be had rather go backhand take his chance, than
stay and be' a fpeftator. It seems as it these kin
dred spirits were not ignorant of each other's
state, and our Mirabeaus make ufc ot the fpiric
of the departed as their familiar.
Is it, or is it not to be regretted, that as Mi
rabeau has left his principles behind hira, he has
not left his talents. His disciples are as profli
gate, not as wife.
We are told in certain orations, of the magic
of the Funding System. There seems to be a
magic which forneiiines inspires the orators to
condemn it, as giving the holders of the certifi
cates too muchâand at others they condemn it #
as not having given enough ; and they urge the
propriety of giving the balance saved by the pub
lic to the officers. Thus, as sorcery and magic
work on the party, the crow is rometimes white
and sometimes black. Can these conjurers tell
how much the public has saved by givjng too
much to the creditors.
There art certain persons who would
suited by having no laws. There are oihfc*Â»
Who have urgent reasons to carry thcra ftiU fur
ther. They must have dishonest laws. No
wonder then we have a clamor froin aU-the
tribe jwho hunger and thirst to fee iniquity
established by law. They hate monied systems,
and all plans of public credit. Paper bill* aj*4
tender aÂ£ts, having neithei of those corruprm'g
ingredients, money or credit, in them, would
fit their fancy to a hair.
There is a complaint that the difoftt parts of
the Union are not completely informed of the
nature of public measures. If that complaint 1 i
well grounded, it affords a good reason for tKfc
people at a distance being very flow id believtf
evil reports of their governmerft, as they ar*
very liable 10 be deceived, and imposed upon.
It should be remarked, that falfehood otiC-traVeli
the post. The carriers of falfe news do not wait
to make up their mail, nor are they detained if
any poft-office. In proportion as there it a
defect of true information in any part of th*
Union, there is an abundance of that whrch hi
not true. The best remedy for this mrfehief, u
for the people to suspend their judgments on
public measures, rill they can get poiTefled oK
fufficient grounds to form them maturely.
There are certain popularity feekeTs, who go
about to all public meetings like so many ped*
lars. It is a barter tradeâlies against pubtic
officers, and abuse of Congress without meafurt,
are trucked off for party influence and votes.
