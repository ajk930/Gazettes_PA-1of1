FROM DUNLAP's AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER
IN the course of human events, nothing can be more grateful to
the philanthropiil, to the friends of the rights of man, than
the progreflive increase of liberty in the world. To fee the gi
gantic image of despotism prostrate itfelf before the genius of
ileedom ; to know that twenty-four millions of men have escaped
from the hated fiaftile of Slavery, and broken the pha ns with
which they were boundâthat they have aliened, with glorious ef
fect, theii inherent and unalienable rights; that they are reftorr-d
to themselves, to their country. to their rights and to their hber
ty ; âare circumstances which mud pour an overflowing tide of
joy upon the hearts of all the friends of human nature. The eman
cipation of so great a number of our fellow creatures, is a suitable,
and it is a dignified fubjeft of congratulationâthe late gl 01 ious
ievolution in France presents this grand fubjett of joy to the feel
ings of humanity. The regeneration of so great and powerful a
kingdomâthe renovation of its rights, and the exaltation of its
slaves to the high and dignified ehara&cr of citizens, are events so
analagous to the experience of Ihefe United States, that true Ame
ricans cannot hear of them without taking a deep interefl in
their benefits, and bestowing the benevolent wish of 44 Efto per
petua" to the newly risen glory of ranee, and the newly acquir
ed liberty of their citizens ! âThis revolution is on many accounts
unexpected and astonishing ; but its leading reasons may be found
among the causes of all revolutions. For it is not the Prince
alone, fupremc as he k, that forms the genius of an empire, it iv
the gradual change of opinion and evolution of sentiment in the
people; which, though flow in its progress, is generally irreiift
able and permanent in its duration. And it is this change of opi
nion and this evolution of sentiment in the people of France,
that has produced a regeneration of their government. It is not,
however, a matter of wonder that the progress of civil and poli
tical liberty should find enemies in the friends of ariflocracy -nor
that the principles of any fyflem of freedom whatever should
meet with enemies in the courts of kings, arcd the friends of mo
narchial government and hereditary succession. But it is more
truly astonishing, and yet more unaccountable, that the unquesti
onable Rights of Man, and the principles of liberty and free go
vernment ihould find an enemy in the liflofthofe who have rank
ed high as American Patriots.
The late revolution in France has given rife to much political
diffcntion in Europe. Mr. Burke, formerly the friend of liberty,
but now the metamorphosed flatterer of kings, lias led the way.
With all thetu?ious zeal of ariftocratical fanaticifm, he has plead
the c.aufe of the kiÃg of Great-Britain. Mr. Paine, the author
of Common Sense, has, in the bold stile of a F recto an, advoca
ted thecaufeoi the people of England, and of the worldâthe
rights of men, and fully answered Mr. Burke.
It is worthy of remark, that the three principal points for
which Mr. Burke contends, areâthat the nation of England have
no rtght m
lit. To chufe their own governors.
2d. To cashier them for mifconduft.
3d. To frame a government for thcmfclvcs.
_ And he asserts with confidence, that they utterly disclaim those
lights, ani that they will refill the pratlical assertion of them
witti their lives and fortunesâMr. Paine has particularly replied
to and refuted this spurious and heretical doarine.
Pained at the prostration of Mr. Buike's argument, solicitous
for the progress of British principles in America, and with heart
felt anxiety regarding the tottering reputation of hereditary fuc
ceflion, Pubhcola, f-orn the town of Bolton, has blown the
trumpet of aristocracy, and is now echoing the kntiments of Mr
-Burke in America.
I T h e Â°kjeftof Publicola is by no means doubtful. I have
Joughtfor his polar principle, and I think I have not fought in
vain. Could he < ffeft a change of sentiment in the people of these
.States m favor of monarchy and hereditary fucceffinn, his pur
pose wouldl be answered. He knows that this change, if ever
made, must be gradually made; and he also knows, that the
continual diffufiotis of his anftocratical principles are the only
rrlTp Â° purpofr. Americans then ought to
read Publicola with a jealous caution.
Publicola, previous to entering into a consideration of Mr.
Paine s arguments, has given us a (hort character of the pc, form
,Â£ir f , , 8S thou S ht proper to oppose. It may not be
mils for me, m like manner, before I notice any of the arguments
Â»,mh jYÂ° g, / e a , br r' e ' defcri P tio " of work to the fourth
M P , ", darive ' f " r thefc a,e Â»H I have seen. As he has ftiled
.I ft , s WO , ma y h '-'. with equal propriety.be ftiled,
historical, political, miscellaneous, satirical and panegyrical '
It .s an encomium upon the Engl .lb government, it is an h.f
one'ft; "It I." A Col " mema, 7 on government, inferring
queft.onable deduflions f. om queft.onable principles ; in this.e
fpeitroo, ,t ,s miscellaneous, and it is fatrrical in the enquiry
Aether a conftuution, like a deed, must be written on paper
or parchment, or whether it has a larger latitude and may be en
graved on stone, or carved on wood."
However queft.onable any of the deductions of Mr. Paine may
he, Pub icola acknowledges the principles from which he infers
those deductions to beunqueftionable. If his principles be true
and they are admitted to be so, why does Publico'a contest those
very principles under the assumed veil of opposing the inferences
deduced from them, and which only hi; considers questionable ?
And yet, however unaccountable it [is, Publicola is in this verv
predicament.
Mr. Paine, in treating of the Rights of a Nation
To chufe their own governors.
To cashier them for tnifconduft, and
Io frame a government for themselves lays down this prwpofi
tion with refpeft to that right, * That which a whole nation chooses
to do, it has a right todo.' But Publicola, uncandidly abftraftinz
irns position from the reasoning with which it Hands connected n
Mr. Paine's book,fays " that it cannot,in any sense whatever,be ad
mitted as true " Were Ito contemplate the fame position in the
lame abltraded point of view, I would decide on it by affirm
ing, " that the eternal and immutable laws of juflice and of mo
rality are paramount to all human legislation," and that though
the violation of those l-aws is certainly in the power, yet it is
not among ihe Rights of Nations." But the statement which
Publicoia has made of this principle is by no means ingenuous
Does not Mr. Paine qualify this principle by a confined relation
to the fubjeft of which he is treating ?He docsâWas he writing
* treatise on metaphysics, or on the abftraft principles of morality
or was it a treatise on the Rights of Man ? What is the amount
of his argument ? He brings into view, plain, simple, incontro
vertible principles, which Publicola himfelf acknowledgesâ prov
ing uriqucftionabiy and cxclufively, that when a whole nation
Saturday, July 25, 1791-
chooses to have a particular form of government, it has a right to
have it.
J his is undoubtedly his meaningâand the ahftraÂ£led ground
upon which Publicola has thought proper to conGder this propofi
ion, proves iuconteftibly his want of candor, and a perversion of
meaning intentionally designed to destroy the whole force of Mr.
P'lioe's reasoning.
Having, I think, fufficiently shewn, that the manner of the
atemem of this principle, by Publicola, isuncandid and unge
neious, and that he has given it a conftru&itir which it does not
ir will be obvious that the long train of ufeiences which he
draws from tuch hi s own mis-dated, and ihcrefore, falfe pre
mises,will, \\*ith the reasoning from which lie has deduced them,
fall to the ground.
I theiefore shall rake no notice of them, but proceed biiefly to
consider a few of his arguments to prove the existence of a British
eonftuutio-n, It will, however, be proper hore to premise, that
it is now of 110 importance to free and independent America,
whether Great-Britain has or has not a constitutionâor, if they
nave one, whether it be a constitution of principles or a constitu
tion of articles, or whether it be composed of the common law,
01 of the great body of the statute law, or, in ihort, whether it be
an usurpation itfolf. In all these concerns we stand wholly inde
pendent of them. It is fuflficient for us to know that they have a
government competent to the execution of their treaties, without
enquiring what the cflence of that government is, or whether it
has arisen out of the people or over the people. But since Publi
cola, like Mr. Burke, contends against the rights of the people of
England to chule their own governors, to cashier them for mif
condutt, and to frame a government for themselves, and as the
arguments which he uses for this purpose have a correspondent
force against the like rights of the citizens of America, it will be
proper to make a few remarks upon them.
Publicola asserts, " that the common law of England is the con- |
ftnutionof Great-Biitain, and that the constitution of a country
is not the paper or parchment upon which the compact is written,
that it is the system of fundamental rules by which the people
have consented to be governed, which is alwavs iuppofed to be
impressed upon the mind of every individual, and of which the
written or printed copies are nothing more than the evidence."
u That in this sense the British nation have a constitution." Again
â" It is composed of a venerable system of unwritten or cus
tomary laws, handed down from time immemorial, and fan&i
oned by the accumulated experience of ages, and of a body of
statutes enafled by an authority lawfully competent to that pur
pose." And againâ" The constitution of Great-Britain is a con
stitution of principles, not of articles."
Why will not Publicola, on this fubjeft, to the fourcc of
things ? Docs he mean by this definition thai a constitution is a
compafl antecedent to all government, and from which free go
vernment results ? Or docs he mean tHt it is a fvftem of juris
' prudence, ordained by a government after its inrtitution ? This
is a point necefTary to be fettled, for there is a striking difference
bet ween the of constituting a government, and the acts of a
governmenr after it is constituted. If he means that the latter is
the constitution of Great-Britain, he will find no opposition to
the fentunent, but if the lonner, I deny its existence. In this
sense the people of England have no constitutionâand with this
meaning I defy Publicola to produce the evidence that they have
one. How then will his reasoning, on the fubjecfc of a social com
â  Daft, which he pretends now exists, apply to destroy the inherent
rights of the people of England. As it has never yet been made
appear that the government of England originated in the people,
they yet have these rights inherent in themfeWes in their original
chara&erâlf therefore, they have not these rights at this day,
they never had themâbut the uncontroulable rights of sovereignty
residing in the people antecedent to government, they therefore
have these rights. The right of a people to form a government,
and the power of a government after it is formed, are two diftinft
thingsâbut Pnblicoia has artfully confounded them together, so
as to obfeure the generous principles of freedom. Why not, in
this refpeft, preserve the diftinflion between rights and power ?
Liberty is a bold principle, it is an irrefiftable principleâit in
vites enquiry, nor does it leek the fubterfuges of sophistry for
protection. It avows itfclf to the world, and it declares, that all
lawful, alljuft authority, both legislative and executive, origi
nates fiom the people. That the power and sovereignty of the
people are like light in the fun, original and inherent, and unli
mited by any thing human. That in those who are governors,
it is the refleÂ£ted rays ot that light, borrowed, delegated and li
mited by the sovereign power of the psople.
In the sense in which I admit that Great-Britain has a consti
tution, it is certainly a constitution of principles ; and on the
Tame ground, every country under Heaven, has a constitution of
p inciples. But what are these principles ? not the principles of
a government arising out of the people, but of a government aris
ing over the people. Consequently, it is the arbitrary will of go
vernment, and such, unquellionably, is the government of Great-
Britain. Americans know that it is the omnipotence of Parlia
ment. Why, therefore, in the name of Common Sense, IJkou/d
have said Arijlocracy, did not the federal convention of 1787 adopt
such a glorious " Constitution of Principles," instead of a con
stitution of written articles ? And why did not Publicola then
step forward, and like the honcft. Norman mentioned by Mr.
Paine, represent, that " as the Americans had difmifTed or sent
away their King, they would want another," and generously of
fer to be their foveriegn Lord and Master.
Mr. Paine observes, " that a government on the principles on
which constitutional government, arising out of society, are esta
blished, cannot have the right of altering itftlf ; for if it had, it
would be arbitrary." But this, fays Publicola, is not fufficient.
I think it is. But why is it not ? Why, truly, replies Publicola,
" because a nation in forming a social compatt, may delegate the
whole of their collective powers to ordinary legifiator# in perpe
tual succession." In reply to this I contend, that a nation has no
right to form a compact to obligate any but the parties contract
ing, it must therefore ccafe on an infraction of the terms by ei
ther party, and must be void as to all future generations, unless
they revive it for themselves. In compafls we determine and
promise for ourselves onlyâand not for posterity. The jura
sum mi impe r 11, or the rights of sovereignty reside in every ge
neration of men in their original character; and Mr. Paine well
observes, that every generation is equal in rights to the one that
preceded it.âHow, then, has a nation a right to delegate in per
petual ruccejffion ? There is a cruel principle of injullice in the
doctrine of perpetual fucceflion ; it is an enfla'ving principle ; it
is a black ariflocratical do&rine, that absorbs every ray of the fun
of freedom, and swallows up all the rights -of the people to the
end of time. This is the inevitable confequencc of the doctrine
97
~ o
[Whole No. 255.]
of perpetual fucceflion ; it is unjust in theory ; it is tyrannical in
practice ; it is a subversion of the " eternal and immutable laws
)f justice and morality ;" because it is founded on the principle of
A's willing to B. the property of C.âand this I deny that any
nation has a right to do.âFor although a whole nation should be
mad enough to adopt such a form of government, yet as thev
could have no property in posterity, a future generation would
have an undoubted right not meiely to alter, but entirely to abo
lish it ; and for the very reason because 41 the consent of that
posterity would be neceflary before they could be bound by tbofe
laws;" and I maintain further, that the fame people who conftU
tute a government, have a right to change or totally annihilate it,
whenever they choose so to do, even if it should have answered all
the purposes for which it was originally instituted. This is a
principle inseparable from the rights of sovereignty, originally re
sident in the people, and from all authority emanating from them.
Government is nothing else but power, and the power of a free
government is nothing but the delegation of a trufi. It is a mere
authority of agency, which the constituents may resume at plea
lure. But the resumption of this right is one thing, and the ex
pediency o>f it another : and it is hardly to be supposed that a
nation will diflolve the bands of the social compact, unless they
find it expedient so to do. Publicola however, confounds the
right and expediency together, and from this sophistical jumble
of ideas, he bewilders the fubjeft he attempts to explain, and
clearly evinces that the pursuit of truth is not his only object, or
the way to truth must lie throngh the mazy labyrinths of fophiU
try.
I have heard of a man (perhaps Publicola knows him) who pof
fcfled theefteem and confidence of a free, generous, patriotic peo
ple; who partook liberally o{ their bounty, and was raised by
their general voice, to an office of high dignity and trust in their
government ; whose pride it ought to have been, and whose duty
it was to have fupportedthe principles,and to have contributed to
the welfare of that government to the utmoftof his abilities, or to
have rejeftcd the office. The latter, however, he did not do; but
under a fi&itious name, employed his whole force of art, of genius
and erudition in collecting and pouring forth floods of heretical,
ariftocratical dottrines in direst opposition to the free and equal
principle of the very government which he administered.â
Strange iriconfiftency !
Let those who sigh for monarchy and pant after aristocracy,
court the munificence of princes and prop the tottering thrones ot
Kings. Let them weep over the dying image of royaltyâbut let
the independent sonÂ« of America blow the trumpet of freedom,
and proclaim to the world their liberty and happiness. The un-
Ihaken faith of these, is, that all [iower is originally inherent in
the people, and that whatever governments are not founded oil
their authority alone, and instituted by them for their peace, fafety
and happiness, are not free but ufurped,and that they therefore
have and in * contempt* of Kings, Princes, and the whole group
of Ariftocrates, will, exercise the right of establishing and of al
tenng, reforming or abolishing government in such manner or
form as they may think proper for securing the bleflings of free
dom. AGRICOLA.

The impriidence of the crew of a Venetian
ftlip had laiely nearly caused the death of their
Captain. In firing the usual salute, on passing
the walls of the Seraglio, the crew forgot that
the guns were loaded with balls, which not only
alarmed those within the walls, but also damaged
some of the buildings. The Sultan was so exas
perated, that he demanded the head of the Cap
tain, and, but for the interposition of the Dra
goman, who is a great friend to the Venetian
Ambassador, the Captain would have been be
headed. However the matter having been ex
plained, he was pardoned ; but on condition of
remaining under an arrest for some time in thÂ»

BERLIN, April iÂ£.
The Gommandeur Great Cross of the Order of

Royal Navy of England, arrived at Potsdam last
week, and was immediately admitted to a pri

introduced by the British Minifler.
P A R I S, April 28.
M. de la Fayette has at length yielded to the
reiterated solicitations of his fellow-citizens, and
resumed his former station of commander in
chief of the National Guards.
On Monday morning all the battalions appear
ed under arms, and waited on tlieir General to
teftify their joy and their gratitude ; these fen
ments were manifefted in a particular manner,
when M. de la Fayette appeared at the Place de
Greve, clothed in his uniform, and surrounded
by a guard. Men, women, children, old men,
all the croud surrounded him, seemed eager to
embrace, and actually clasped him in their arms !
At halt past one o clock on the fame day, n
grand dcputatiou ol the national guards, without
any didinclion of rank or military regulation as
to coin panics, marched lix a-breaft to wait on his
Majesty. Being arrived at the Tliuilleries, theymounted the great fiaircafe, and travel fed the
apartments till they arrived at his Majelly's ca
binet, in which the Monarch received them.
The General who was at their head, in a (hort
and apposite speech, informed hisMajefty ot the
attachment of the Parisian ariny, who in return
observed, " that the National Guards, who had
done so much for the accompli/hment of the re
solution, had nothing moie to do than togivean
example of obedience to the laws, and the con
ftiiution would then be fixed on a basis that would
render It immortal." The deputation then filed
off", before the King, making the walls of thcPa
lacerefound wirh " Vivt la Natien, ei vive It Ret."
A citizen soldier, on palfing before his Majesty,
exclaimed, " Sire voila vos veritables a:nis!" (be
hold your true friends, Sire!) bis Majeltv imme
diately replied with the rood lively emotion, "1
am convinced of ir."
The Grenadier Company of the battalion of
the Oratory have been discharged, and the Gre

This intrepid citizen has Ilowever experienced
the patronage of the club called the Cordelieres.
â who have objected to the late oath taken by the
National Guards.
This circumstance, and that of the refractory
Clergy being permitted to hire, occupy, and
preach in the Hotel des Theatins, are the mod
undoubted proofs of the liberty now enjoyed
here, as in both these inflances, religious and po
litical fentirnents, however different froui those
of the people, are freely tolerated, and recal to
the memory of the clal'ical (tranger, who vifirs
Paris, those happy days which Rome enjoyed
an amiable and godlike Emperor, when
every citizen " might think what he pleased,
and fay what he thought."
NATIONAL ASSE MBIT, April 29.
Diftiirbances having lately taken place, from
some soldiers having attended one of the socie
ties known by the name of " Friends to the con
Aitution," whicii conduct was opposed by their
officers, the Aflembly palled the following de
creeâ
" The National AlTembly decrees, Thar the
officers, subalterns, and soldiers of all descripti

zens, attend the societies which aflemble peace

May 4. The fuhject of Avignon was once more
refunied, when after a long and warm debate,
upon the qtieftion being p*ir, whether Avignon
and the Comtat {hnnld or should not be annexed
to the French empire, it was determined by a
majonry of 487 to 316, that they Ihould not be
annexed to France.
May $. Two papers, of very great moment,
were this day read in the Aflembly. The firit, a
circular letter from the Emperor to the different
electors, dating; to them the fleps which had
been pursued by him as head of the Empire, in
relation tn the decrees of the National Aflembly,
which have been complained of as injnriojis to
the rights ofrhat part of the Germanic b'>dy in
Lorraineand Alsace. The intention ofthis letter
is stated to be, that the Germanic body may a
dopt the means which appear to them best suited
to obtain redress ofthe grievances complained of.
The other was a letter from M. Montmorin to
the Pope's Nuncio at Paris, Hating, " That his
Majefl v was much surprised at the answer of his
Holiness to the letter from his Majesty, an nounc
ing the recall of M. le Cardinal de Bernis
that his Majefly saw with astonishment, that the
P ;>? appeared to refufe receiving an Ambaflador
of K ance, who had taken, without reftrklion,
the r- h equired of all public officersâthat his
Majeftv . an scarcely believe this to be the inten

neElian b-.tviem the Holy See and the French Moaar
âthat no Ambaflador can be sent to his Holi
rief who has not taken the National Oath and
that if his Holiness pertifted in tliis, tlie dignity
ofthe nation, and that of his Majesty, would not
permit aNuncio from the Pope to remain at Paris."
Tne letter concludes, recommending to his
Holiness to weigh well the consequences which
may result from fnch conduct, and to bear in
mind that, whatever they may be, he will have
provoked them.

Whether.the divilion of Burke and rox, may
produce any fchifin in the party ; whether any
of that noble and opulent Ariltocracy who com
pose it, may participate the alarms and refent
inents of Mr- Burke, may be a matter of much
fpecularion. If conjecture be adrmffible, ir seems
more likely that the Apostle of Despotism will
be left alone. The rational fiends ot Anflo
cracy will regard him as too intemperate and in
difcrcet for a Leader: they will confuler all fear
of convulsions in England as the dread of events
certainly remote, and perhaps visionary, and if
they think the danger real, they must fee the
wretched policy of Mr. Bu'ke, who accelerates
its progress by conferring on its promoters pre
mature importance. And above all, they will
fee that their desertion of Mr. Fox will only be
unfettering his mind; and transferring a great
Leader from a Faction to rhe People.
They dread those difcuifion-s which the indis
cretion of Mr. Burke perpetually provokes. They
are conscious of the feeblenefs to which the 10l
of their Leader would reduce them, and they
must tremble 'at the measure to which Mr. Fox,
unshackled with party, might be impelled at so
critical a moment, by the energy of his own vir
tuous and enlightened mind.
Letters from Stockholm mention, that the Ruf
fian Minister had delivered a declaration to the
King of Sw eden, intimating, that if he allowed

ken on board hk fqnadron a large detachnien
from the arhiv of Prince Repnin, failed to Kilia
nova, where having formed a junction with Ad
miral Suwarrow's fleet, he failed for Conllanti
nople, and taking advantage of the commotion
which prevailed within that city, landed his
troops at Pera, and took the place without refin
ance. At the time of theÃuffian troops entering
Constantinople, the city was on fire in fifty dif
ferent parts.
The Ruffians have gained another vidtorv over

A Paragraph from Georgia has lately made its
appearance in several papers* ; in which the
writer intimates that a treatifeon the cultivation
of the vine would be a very ufefnl addition to
the stock of agricultural information, especially
to the southward.âA cori efpondent who is per
fectly acquainted with the practice as well as
theory of the vine culture, proposes, if fufficient
encouragement is held out by the southern far
mers collectively, to furnifh them with a com
pleat account of the several modes of culture ufcd
in Burgundy and other parts of France, in every
different kind of foil. If such a subscription can
be railed as would prove a reafonablecompenfa
tion for his trouble, he proposes to devote his
whole time and attention ro the fnbjecfi; and his
experience, he conceives, will enable him ro'givf
such accurate and minire information, as would
nvove a fufficient guide to fuch'as choose to un
dertake to cultivate flie native vine ; which, from
the info rmation he has been able to colletft since
his residence in this country, if properly done,
he thinks could not fail of success.

Eur ope an Intelligence has been i eceived to the
26th of May, by the Hope, Capt. Makins, from
Irelandâby which we learn, That a great and
important revolution 1,1 favour of the Rights of
Man, under the auspices of the King, has taken
p.ace in 1 olandâthe condition of the peafantrv
of that country, which was degrading to the
lowed degree, ,5 greatly altered for the better:
.his is conhdered as a prelude to a more perfect
confhtntion â1 he Court of Denmark has repeat
ed its declaration of a determined neutrality
In Brabant and Flanders, the public tranquility

having determined not to annex the Venaiffin to
their empire, the consequence will be, that the

â Sir Sidney Smith is superintending the con
urn ft 1011 of a flotilla for the King of Prussia to
be opposed to that of the Prince de Naflhu. The
answer of the Empress to the English Minister
it is said without reserve, is hoilileâand the
rneafurcs purftied by Great-Britain appear to be
founded on an expecftation of warâSome very
plain advice has recently been given to the Queen
of France, in which it is observed, that "in che
lifhing the illusions of an expiring party, you
will only prolong your own torment; it will be
much better for you to abjure them in an au
thentic and sincere manner." Tbefe obferva
uons, in conjunction with a letter to the National
Allembly, and another to the foreign Ministers
which were lately communicated by the King, if
there is any meaning in words, or honor in the
human heart, will convince the Queen that any
machinations again ft the re volution must iflhe in
total defeat and difappoi ntment. Great con-
Anions continue to prevail in Constantinopleâ
I be Sultan it is said has lately caused a whole
company of Ja.ni(laries, who appeared inclined

The bridges are to be conftru&ed on the principlesof those erect
ed over Charles, Myftick, and Beverly Rivers in the State of Mas
sachusetts, with a draw to admit a free paftage for vcftels with fix
t d standing masts, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as lhall be determined most con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or biocks on
each fide of the entrance of such araiv, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid vefTels in pafling through. Also, one lamp on cach fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to lunnte, during
â he continuance of the lease.
The bridges ate to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as (hall render them perfeaiy substantial and secure in
.he opinion of the commiflioners, and are to be of a fufficient
height to proteÂ£t them aga'.nft the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for carnage way, 20 feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on each fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet.
Do. for ballufti ades, 1 foot each, 2 feet.
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluttrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Boston and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept n constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be surrendered in good order,
agreeably to the a6t.
The following are the terms which the commiflioners are au
thorrfed to offer to contra&ors :
A lcafe of the excJufive privilege of the bridges for a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths ot the pre
sent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an estimate as could pofliMy be obtained, the
attual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last part,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will confequeittly produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per ann. This may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United Slates, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York, and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftru&ion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the western fide of the Hudson, are all important
circumstances, which must necessarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads connected
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places (hail be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and ihecontra&s for erecting them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contra# on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to William Maxwell
Esq. in New-York, fpecifying the shortest period of lease for
which thev will undertake to erett the said bridges,together with
proper security for performing the fame.
