true and genuine Discovery of ANFMAL ELEC
TRICITY and MAGNETISM: calculated to dc
ttel and overthrow alt counterfeit defcriptiovs oj
the fame.
IT is generally admitted, that there is a ple
num, or universal fluid, which occupies all
joace, and that all bodies moving therein, abound
with pores or points of introduction, and imer
ftices to receive and return it ; that this fluid
coiififts of fire, light, air, or f"pirit, which flowing
through one body by the currents which iflue
therefrom to another, as in a magnet, produces
that phosiioinenon we call Animal Magnetism.
Now as it is the nature of all fluids to tend to an
equilibrium, therefore the efforts which bodies
make towards each other produce Animal Elec
tricity. Animal Electricity is no more than the
effect produced between two bodies, one of which
has more motion than the other; aphaenonrenon
proving that the body which has moll motion
communicates it tothe other, until an equilibri
um of motion be eftablilhed between them ; with
inequajity of motion there is Animal Electricity :
with<equality and reciprocity of motion there is
Animal Magnetism. It is the purpose of nature
that Animal Eledtricity should exist only to pro
duce Animal Magnetifin ; the former ends where
the latter begins. The human body may be
therefore compared to an electrical machine, the
arms the conductors, the fingers the pointers.
Hold the fingers of both hands for foine time to
wards the invalid's pericardium, and you will
soon perceive all the effetfls of eletftricity on the
patient : continue the motion till hq is filled with
the eleiftrical fluid, which will flow with great
velocity from your fingers, in proportion as your
mental faculties are engaged ; this yon will soon
kijow by the commoto or crisis he will be put in
to, if his disorder requires either the one or the
other. But if the treatment does not produce
either of these, depend upon it his restoration
will be very fan* bmught about without ihem.
This fcitnce, has-been kept hid and concealed
from the multitude, and great fuuis have been giv
en fomhe knowledge of it : but I can allure the
public,that it is as fairly laid open in the following
little treatise as it possibly can be in a few words.
I have had the happiness of beinginftrutfted in
this wonderful fyflem by a gentleman of the firlt
abilities, and who has treated, many days, more
than an hundred a day, and with great success
in many instances. And I was not taught it un
der any reftriition, and therefore can with free
dom and pleasure communicate to others what I
have received; and 1 doubt not, bnt any person
of even a common capacity, by attending closely
to the rules here laid down, may become as tife
ful an operator as tliofe that have paid large funis
ft>r their knowledge. But let not those be dis
couraged who are but beginners, but let them
persevere and exert themselves in the practice of
it, and they will fee, in many instances, such suc
cess as will doubtless give them spirits to go on,
and encourage them to persist.
If you would w:(h to treat patients with success
observe the following rules or direttions,
Firjf. Be as much cbftraffed as poflible ; put
every other thought and idea out of your mind,
and seek to enter in, and for a time take pofief
fion of the fubjcift, whom you are about to treat.
Secondly. Let your mind be filled with affcfl'ton
and bcnevalonce towards the subject that you are
treating. Let all the energy of your foul be fix
ed on the relief of your patient, and generally
success will follow.
Thirdly. Let there be a constant intention within
you ; keep tip an idea of the complaint that you
wish to remove ; be earneltly desirous to give all
the assistance in your power towards the relief
ofthe fubjecfh Kindness, pity, constant inten
tion, and companion, are great promoters of suc
cess in this matter. Strange as this may seem,
ynu will find it true, and tliofe who have consi
dered the amazing; powers of fvmpathy and anti
pathy will eafilyfee it reasonable.
Fourthly. Exert the strong internal faculty of
volition, or your will, towards thefubje< r t that you
are called to treat ; determine to do good to the
diseased ; and you will find oftentimes a strange
connection with those whom you are treating.â
This is produced by the incorporation of the at

force, and the more conspicuous the effects of the
treatment will be.
If the power of the mental faculties in men
were known, they would be surprized at them
. selves ; but these powers lie hid till they are
proved Ivy sensible operations really to exist. It
has been frequently observed, that when persons
are spoken of they are near, and soon come into
fight, and when you think on absent persons, it is
of ten found they are at the fame time as carneft

AS beauteous Phosphor, in his flaming robe,
Looks thro' night's curtain round the spacious globe,
Sees the pale Moon in weflern skies decline,
And bids the motn in blulhing radiance shins ;
Soon as Aurora breaks the (hades of night,
Sinks down, embofom'd in his native light ;
Thus Franklin (hone; and round life's fields afar,
Pour'd forth the effulgence of the morning star.
He walk'd with nature thro' her mazy road,
And eyed the beauties of the forming God ;
Taught us why lightning its red wings unfurl'd,
And why the thunder rock'd the aitonifh'd world;
Search'd the deep system of ele&ric fire,
And fliew'd it dreaming on the conscious wire;
Till Heaven, admiring, calj'd the sage away,
And mix'd his radiance with celeflial day.
But while, in tears, we mourn the long adieu,
Lo, Adams rises tÂ» the enraptur'd view.
As some fair fountain, in the vernal plain,
Breaks thro' the ground and pours its streams amain ;
Thro' all the vale in foft meander spreads,
Clears the choak'd foil, and wakes the verdant meads ;
So from his feat the exalted patriot stands,
And gives new ardor to reviving lands;
O'er every clime his voice, in thunder hurl'd,
Sounds sacred terror to the admiring world.
Britannia, fearful, hears her funeral song,
And the dire death-watch founding from his tongue.
See, fee Columbus ! from the tottering throne,
A George defccndrng to embrace thy son;
From realm to realm the immortal ftatefraan flies,
And Independence rushes down the ikies.
His pen, his voice his country still (hall guard,
By Heaven inspired, end for the talk prepar'd.
And thou, great WASHINGTON ! immortal sage!
Pride of the world ! thou Phoebus of thine age !
Whose awful name the tyrant dreads to hear,
And startled envy drops the bloody spear ;
Say, can the Mufc confefs the rapt'rous fire,
Nor found thy praises on the tuneful lyre?
Thrice grateful talk! thy God-like deeds to sing !
What flowing numbers fhou'd adorn the firing !
When firft, from Britain's shore, involv'd in blood,
Black war rufii'd vengeful o'er the billowy flood !
When death, behind, difplay'd his horrid head,
And the grim Furies left their iron bed ;
Round these fair climes, where peace, unknown to arms,
And freedom, sacred freedom spread her charms;
Hurl'd their black fhafts, fiom hell's unbounded ftoie,
And desolation crimfon'd all the shore;
The WASHINGTON arose, to grasp the shield,
And flew like lightning to the.gloomy field.
The rnurd'rous crew, aghast, cOnfefs'd the alarm,
Nor dared the vengeance of his wafting arm.
Round every plain unerring fate he fends,
And death turns traitor to pursue his friends.
Peace reigns again : And fee, from smiling skies,
Returning freedom to Columbia flies.
Science comes down to wake her native fires,
And WASHINGTON to Vernon's shades retires.
REPORT
OF THE
SECRETARY OF STATE,
On the fubjeÂ£t of rhe
CODAND WHALE FISHERIES,
[continued.]
THE plan of the English government, fmce the peace, has been
to prohibit all foreign filh in their markets, and they have
given from eighteen to fifty pounds (lerling, on every fifhirig ves
sel complying with certain conditions.- This policy ii said to
have been so far fuccefstul as to have raised the number of lea
men employed in that business in 1786, to fourteen thousand, and
the quantity of fifh taken, to seven hundred and thirty-two thou
sand kentals. The table No. 1, hereto annexed, will present to
the eye, this history more in detail.
The fifheiics of the United States, annihilated during the war ;
their veffcls, utensils, and filherincn tleftroyed ; their markets in
the Mediterranean and Biitifb-America loft, and their produce
dutied in those of France, their competitors enabled by bounties
to meet and under fell them at the few markets remaining open
without any public aid, and indeed, plying aids to the public :
Such werethc hopeless auspices, underwhich this important busi
ness was to be resumed. Yet it was resumed, and. aided by the
mere forcc of natural advantages, they employed, during the years
1786, â7, â8, â g, on an average, five hundred thirtv-nine vessels,
of nineteen thousand one hundred eighty-five tons, three thousand
two hundred cighty-feven seamen, and took two hundred fifty
thousand fix hundred fifty kentals of fifb : (fee No. 2,) and an of
ficial paper, (No. 3) (hews that, in the last of those years, our ex
portation amounted to three hundred feventy-five thousand and
twenty kentals, and thirty thousand four hundred sixty-one bar
rels, dcdu&ion made of three thousand seven hundred one ken
tals, and fix thousand three hundred forty-three barrels of foreign
fifb received and re-exported. (See No. 4.) Still, however, the
ralculatioDi in (No. 5) which accompany the representation, shew,
9
t#t&o
[Whole No. 211.]
that the profits of the sales in the years 1707,-8, were too (mall to
afford â¡ living to the fifherman, and on those of 1789, ihere was
such a loss as to withdraw thirty-thiee vessels, of the town of
Marblehead alone, from the further pursuit of this business : And
the apprehension is, that, without some public aid, those flill re
maining will continue to withdraw t and this whole commerce be
engrofled by a firtgle nation.
This rapid view of the cod-fifhery, enables us to discern under
what policy it has flourifhed or declined in the hands of other na
tions, and to mark the fa&,*that it is too poor a business to be left
to it itfelf, even with the nation the most advantageously fttuated.
It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and
the disadvantages which oppose us in this contest.
Our advantages areâ
1. The neighbourhood of the great fifheries, which permits our
fifhermen to bring home their fifh to be salted by their wives and
Jix'dd ren.
f/1. The shore so near at hand as to enable the vefTels
/so run into port in a storm, and so lefTcn the risk, for which dis
tant nations must pay insurance.
3. The winter fifheries, which, like houftiold manufa&ures,
employ portions of time which would otherwise be useless.
4. The fmallnefs of the vefTels, which the fhoitnefs of the voyage
enables us to employ, and which, consequently, require but a {mail
capital.
5. The cheapness of our vefTels, which do not cost above the
half of the Baltic fir vefTels, computing price and duration.
6. Their excellence as sea boats, which decreases the rifle, and
quickens the returns.
7. Thefuperiority of our mariners in (kill, a&ivity, entcrprize,
fobrietv and order.
8. The cheapness of provisions.
9. The cheapness of casks, which, of itfelf, is said to be equal
to an extra profit of fifteen per cent
These advantages are of such force, that, while experience has
proved that no other nation can make a mercantile profit on the
Newfoundland fifhery, nor can support it without national aid,
we can make a living profit, if vent for our filh can be procured.
Of the diladvantages opposed to us, those which depend on our-
I selves, are, â
Tonnage, and naval duties on the vefTels employed in the fifhery.
Impost duties on fait, on tea, rum, sugar, mo-1 TTf j â¢ t
lafles, hooks, lines and leads, duck, cordage and C fifh'ci 11C
cables, iron, hemp, and twine. ) C 1
Coarse woollens worn by the fifhermen ; and the poll-tax levied
by the State on their persons. The statement, No. 6, shews the
amount ofthefe, exclusive of the State tax. and drawback on the
fifh exported, to be 5.25 dollars per man, or 57.75 dollars per ves
sel of fifty-five tons. When a business is so nearly in equilibrio,
that one can hardly discern whether the profit be fuflicient to con
tinue it, or not, finaller sums than these fuffice to turn the scale
against it. To these disadvantages, add ineffe&ual duties on the
importation of foreign fifh. In juftification of these last, it is ur
ged that the foreign fifh received, is in exchange for the produce
of agriculture. To which it may be anfwercd, that the thing gi
ven, is more merchantable than that received in exchange, and
that agriculture hÂ«s too many markets to be allowed to take away
thofeof the {liberies. It will reft, therefore, with the wisdom of
the legislature, to decide, whether prohibition should not be op
-1 posed to prohibition, and high duty to high duty, on the fifh of
other nations : Whether any, and which of the naval and other
duties, may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fifherman
in the form of a drawback or bounty; and whether the loss of
markets abroad may not, in some degree, be compensated by
creating markets at home ; to which might contribute the consti
tuting fifh a part of the military ration, in flations, not too distant
from navigation, a part of the necessary sea stores of vefTels, and
the encouraging private individuals to let the fifherman share with
the cultivator, in furnifiiing the fuppliesof the table. A habit in
troduced fiom motives of patriotism, would soon be followed,
j from motives of taste : And who will undertake to fix limits to
I this demand, if it can be once excited, with a nation whichdoubles,
and will long continue to double at very short periods ?

ODE TO HENRY.
WHAT bliss the voice of Music gives,
While transport in the bolora live*,
While virtue, borne on every found,
Spreads love and happiness around !
The Soul in purer vision fees
The ills of human Jife retire ;
And Adoration loads the breeze,
With praises that to Heaven aspi r e.
flow few the happy power possess
Thefympathizing heart to blcfs
With pictures of ideal joy,
Which strengthen virtue, not destroy !
7hey are the Muse's favorite Care ;
Perfeaion thro' their fouls she breathes
And crowns them, faireft of the fair,
With Glory's never-fading wreaths.
And He whose song their voice infpirea
With holy Pleasure's warm defiies ;
With power thetrembling lyre to move
lo accents of immortal love ;
Shall, robed in modest merit, shine
H's country's wonder, and its praise ;
While, bending at her moral shrine,
To Truth he consecrates his lays.
Him shall the love of nations hail,
Bom o'er Oppreflion to prevail ;
Virtue's own hand (hall round his tomb
Twine circlets of immortal bloom ;
The Loves eternal incense burn ;
The Muses there the Lyie shall place ;
And Gloiy shall the simple urn
With Henry's name, in transport, grace.

let him make as many motions to the court as
possible, no matter how impertinent, frivolous,
orjndecent; for although rhey may be fruitlefs
and unimportant, and consequently despised by
the decerning few, yet the majority of numbers
among the ordinary audience, will impute his
loquacity and zeal to a redundancy of profound
knowledge and talents, capable of miraculous
improvement.
If tie should be engaged in the fame cause with
an old aud experienced counsellor, let him rife
magnanimously, upon all interlocutory and occa
sional queltions, and without servile consultation
offer and obtrude his sentiments upon the Court
in a harjh, sonorous, authoritative tone of voice, as
if conscious of his innate superiority this will
infallibly magnify or stretch him in the eves and
opinion of the multitude.
It will be a happy circumstance, if he can com

if not sovereign contempt. If they peaceably
fuffer hnn to pass without applicable animadver

When managing a cause in court, by all means
let him browbeat, blackguard, and abuse the oppo

for this will insure the confidence of his employer

By an express which arrived from Venango

from every appearance a stroke was intended on
that settlement, as several parties of unfriendly
Indians had been discovered by scouts that were

V Philadelphia, May 7
It has been said th . (Yip; e-iie independent pow
er in the hands of either the cm, the few, or the
many, has in all ages and countries degenerated
into tvrannyâThis observation is founded on
universal experience : i l;e revolntionifts in the
time of Charles Ift. annihilated the House of
Peers and the Hierarchyâbut did tlvev eltablilh
a free government ? They did not : Mr. Paine
applauds the National Ailembly of Franceâthey
have not yet gone so far as Cromwell and his
party did*âperhaps they never mayâas the
French nation have a predilection for Kings,
at prefent âShould the time however arrive when
they are fully enlightenedâthey will then, to use
a borrowed phrase, fee the nonsense of " this,
that and to'ther, and Kings will be thought as lit
tle of by the French nation, as they are by Mr.
Paine till then the French Revolution, accord
ing to him, is essentially defective : Ac this time
however the approbation of the King to the
nieafures of the National Aflembly is mentioned
by the friends to the Revolution as a molt impor
tant circumltance in its favor.
A correfpondenr observes that there are some
persons in the world of so peculiar acaftof mind
that nothing meets with their approbation which
has not received their particular fiat as an es
sential requisite to its exiltence. The system
of the bank of the United States is however
almost an exception to the above observation ;
natives and foreigners have awarded it their
approbationâthe former on account of its im
mediate and obvious advantage*, and for the
wisdom andforefiglu discovered in its organiza
tionâ wifely confideriiig that Should a foreign
direction obtain, and acquire a preponerating
influence, the time may arrive, when the def
trudtionof the bank of this country, and a total
derangement of its finances might be compcnfa
ted by the douceurs of a foreign power. Fo
reigners among other reasons, because it reserves
to the citizens of this government the exclusive
direction ; for while the capital is tinder the con
troulof persons the molt fully competent to judge
of characters, they maybe more fully allured that
nothing will be done to counteract the general
interest of the concerned.
The Bank of the United States mayjuflly
be considered as a propofuion made to the mo
nied interest, foreign and domeltic and in
faift, appears to both in a very favourable
point of lightâthe latrer, from every informa
tion, are making great pi eparations to fubferibe,
and the terms are so advantageousÂ»that no equal
object of Speculation is perhaps presented in
any quarter of the globe to the former.
A late writer fays, that the only folk! founda
tion for Liberty, is Virtue: When virtue is gone,
liberty loon follows ; but this mult refer to pub
lic virtue, for it is notorious, that some of the
molt renow ned modern champions of liberty, are
ilrangers to personal virtueâls thefentiment then
without foundation ? I trow notâfor tho no de
pendence can be rationally placed on the patri
otic profeffions of a vicious character, yet their
being obliged to aflame thefeinblanceof honesty
to carry their points, is an indirect confirmation
of the principle.
" The foundation of all social virtue is a belief
of the exigence and government ot a Deityâa
regard to the Deity cannot be maintained with
out foine public exercises of religion.âSocial
worship is thereforeneceflary to thehappinefs of
society, and to the easy adminiltration of govern
mentâand in this view worthy the attention of
every legislature, while in a higher view it de
serves the regard of every individual."
Patriotil'm, like Pieligion, often enjoins duties
which are paramount to every other considera
tionâ and tho the felfifh part of mankind dero
gate from the merit of every action performed
by their contemporaries, by imputiug tlie mo
tives to inferior confederationsâyet a confcions
J iteirriry will furnilh a reward for every public
fpiiited exertion, of which envy and cetiftire
cannot deprive the votaries of virtue and bene
volence.

w hicli have been raised in New-Jersey lor the

Ridicule titles, honors and diftiudtions among
mankind, and you will always be in the majority.
Embrace the firft favorable opportunity to tra
duce the government under whicliyouliveâthe
more free it is, the more you may abuse it with
impunity and success.
Always reserve your opinion till you know
which is the strongest fide.
By observing tlie foregoing, some have ac
quired popularity, honors and riches, without
potfeHing any principles of morality or honelty.
Extrall of a litter from Baftsw, April 16.
Several arrivals from England, bring us the
ttateof politics and war in Europe, by which it
appears they continue to act over and over the
fame mad scenes which for many ages have dis
graced human nature ; When we refletft how in
competent they are to govern themselves, how
fliould our hearts expand with gratitude to hea
ven for feperating us from them.
Some citizens of the United States when con-
templating the errors or supposed mifcitings of
our o"wn government are apt to depreciate its
value ; let such persons turn their thoughts now
and then to Britain, and other nations of Europe,
and observe the fliocking facrifices of blood and
treasure and faith and honor and religion, and
every thing that is. called goodâand they will
prize independence. Mr. G , who came home
in the last ship that arrivedâinforms me, that
the British and other nations appear now to be
fully sensible of the growing greatness of the
United States : I trust they will have cause to rife
in their ideas of us.
The tour of the Prefidentof the United States
to the southward at this time is a good plan.â
We have heard frequently of unealinefs and op.
positions in respect to some of the revenue laws,
if any thing of the kind really exists among our
fonthern brethren, feeing him in their country
will have a very conciliating effedt, and do more
athoufand arguments from even an Ames
or a Gerry.

some acquaintance with both the countries, that
the common people in America have much more
general and ufeful knowlege, than they have in
any part of Great-Britain, and consequently are
not so violently led away and inflamed with no
velty and curiolity. You can hardly have an

municated itfclf to the powder on boa.d ; the explofum was so
fevcre as to shake most of the houses in the town.
Thelofs, occasioned by this alarming event, must be great,
as the (hip was large and nearly new ; besides, there were goods
to a considerable amount, and a large sum of money on boardâall
which (except part of the money, which has finte been found) was
deflroyed. Wc are informect that this accident proceeded from
the (lewar'd's falling to fle< p and leaving a candle burning in the

Extrath fiom the utifwer to Mr. Bu rke, by Mr. Paine.
" Government, fays Mr. Burke, is a contrivance of human wisdom
Admitting that, government is a contrivance of human wijlom, it
must.necessarily follow, that hereditary fucceflion, ;iixl hereditary
rights (as they are called) can make no part of it, because it is im
poflible to make wisdom hereditary; and on the other hand, that
cannot be a wife contrivance, which in itsdperation may commit
the government of a nation to the wisdom of an idi t. The
ground which Mr. Burke now takes'is lata! to every part of his
cause. The argument changes from hered-itary rights to heredi
tary wisdom , and the question is, Who is the wisest man? He
must now (hew that every one in the line of hereditary fucceflion
was a Solomon, or his title is not good to be a king.âWhat a
stroke has Mr. Burke now made ! To use a sailor's phrase, he has
swabbed the deck, and scarcely left a name legible in the lift of kiti^s;
and he has mowed down and thinned the HouGe of Peers, with a
scythe as formidable as Death and Time. \_Alas y the poor house of
Peers /]
" The opinions of men with respect to government, are chang
ing fact: in all countries. Tiierevolutions of America and France
have thrown a beam of light over the world, which reaches into
man. The enormous expences of governments, have provoked,
people to think, by making them feel : and when once the veil
begins to rend, it admits not of repair. Ignorance of a peculiar
nature, once dispelled, and it is impoflible to re-establish it. It
is not originally a thing of itfelf, but is only the absence of know
ledge ; and tho man may be kept ignorant, he cannot be made ig.
norant. The mind, in discovering truth, a&s in the fame man
ner as it a6U through the eye in discovering obje&s ; when once
any object has been seen, it is impoflible to put the mind back to
the fame condition it was in before it saw it. Those who talk'of
a counter revolution in France, (hew how little thev understand
of man. There does not cxift in the compass of language, an
arrangement of words to express so much as the means of affedf
inga counter revolution. The means must be an obliteration of
knowledge ; and it has never yeÂ» been discovered how to make
man utiknow his knowledge, or unthink his thoughts.
The following paragraph more than hints that Mr. Burke is pensioned.
Mr. Burke is laboring in vain to Hop the progress ot know
ledge ; and if comes with the worfr grace from him, as there is
a certain tranfaftion known in the city, which him fuf
pe&ed of being a pensioner in a fictitious name. This may ac
count for some ft range doftiines he has advanced in his book,
which, tho he points it at the Revolution Society, is elTcttually
dircÂ£led againil the whole nat:on.

A lease of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the pre
sent rates of ferriage.
accurate an estimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
actual receipts of the ferrieÂ® for a medium of five years last past,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will consequently produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per arm. This may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftruftion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the western fide of the Hudson, are all important
circumstances, which must neceflarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads conne&ed
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places shall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and thecontrafls for eieÂ£ling them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately uridcrtaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contra# on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to William Max w ell,
Esq. in N T ew-York, fpecifying the shortest period of lease for
which they will undertake to erect the said bridges, together with
proper security for performing the fame.
