" Whether rhey have means fuffici

on refpeifting Mar/hal Luckner,which

that 30,000 of the National Guard of

M. Choudieu thought there was no

which the enemy would run by pe

The circumitances which have
reached us refpeifting the lurrender
of the town of Longwy, add infinite
ly to the advantage of this firft luc
cefs, fmce it leaves none of those re
grets which are commonly insepara
ble from vitfrory. The befiegeis, as
one may fay, fuffered 110 lo!s, and
there were only a few of the laborers
wounded.
His Excellency Count Clairfayt
having on the 2rft, advanced with
his army Longwy, eretfed
some batteries, which the besieged
endeavored to destroy by keeping np
a violent fire during the whole of
next night, buc their guns having
been badly pointed, our batteries
wei e opened at the break of day, and
a great number of bombs were thrown
into the town, which set fire to it in
feyeral places, but the besieged fountl
means to extinguish the flames.
The night followingrecommenced
their fire, ltill without e(fe<st, while
ours did considerable execution. In
the mean time his Excellency Count
Clairfayt sent a trumpet to fuinmon
the Commandant to Surrender ; but
this being refufed, the army began
to make neaer approaches, upon

The ali'ertion, that the new {yflem

untrue, that it is scarcely iieceflary

corrupt court formed, and corrupt

therefore, it has not overthrown peace,

was ho: ror not to be exceeded. Yet even thi*

fol/jw-CifucM Â»j the Sen4ie> and
$f lie Htm/i (jj Rcprejcntatives,
fT il-Jfeaw Â«f the n,
with which I meet you on the present occasion,
thatiu felicitating you on a continuance of the
Batjenal prosperity, generally, I am not able to
add to it information that tlie Indian hostilities,
which have, for some time pall, diftrefl'ed our
jorch-weftern frontier, have terminated.
â  Yon wilJ, I am persuaded, learn with no Icl?
(oncern than I communicate it,- that reiterated
endeavours, toward? effe&ing a pacification,
have hitherto illued only in new and outrageous
proofs of perlevering hoftilityon the part of the
tribes with whom we are in contest. An ear
ned dÂ»fire to procure tranquility to the fron
tierâto flop the further efrufion of bloodâto
arrest the progress of expenseâto forward the
prevalent wi(h of the nation, for peace, has led
to ftremjous efforts, through various channels,
to accomplilh these defirablc purposes : in
making which efforts, I consulted lei's my own
anticipations of the event, or the fcrupies whiuh
&me confederations were calculated to inspire,
than the wish to find the o-bjeft attainable; or
if not attainable, to ascertain uncauivocally
that l'Â«ch is the- cafe.
' A detart-ofthe rileafures which bare been ptir
fued, and of their conlequences, which will be
aid before you, while it will confirm to you the
fant of success, thus far, wiH, X trull, evince
-hat means as pro'per and as efficacious as could
iave been devife'd,have been employed.âThe if
Cue of some of them,indeed,is Hill depending; but
a favorable one,though not to be despaired of,is
notprojnifed by any thing that has yet hap
pened.
In the course of the attempts which have been
*iade, some valuable citizcns have (alien vifiims
to their zeal For the public service.âA fanthon
commonly refpeÂ£Ud even among savages, has been
found, in this inftan'ce, inefficient to proteÂ£t from
maflacre the emissaries of peace :â It will, I p le _
fume, be duly considered whether the occasion
does not call for an exercise of liberality towards
the families ol tile deceased.
It nvjft add to your concern, to be informed,
that besides the continuation of boftile appearan
ces among the tribes north of (he Ohio,fame threat
mng symptoms have of late been, revived among
iome of those south of it.
A part of tb<â  C l '" roJcV&ir know Hy Â»VjÂ» <-Â» t .
of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the
r<iiineffec river, have long he'cu in the
â¦ommitting depredations on the neighbouring fet
ilements.
It was hoped that the treaty of H-.lfton made
with the Cherokee nation in July, 1791, w< uld
liave prevented a repetition of depredations.
â But the event has not answered this hope.â
The Chickamagas, aided by some banditti oi ano
ther tribe, in their vicinity, have recently per
pctrat. d wanton, and unprovoked hostilities upon
the citizens of the United States in that quauer.
The inlormation which has been received on this
hibjeft will be laid before you.â Hitherto defen
sive precautions only have been Aricily enjoined,
and observed.
It is nor understood that any breach of treaty.
or 3 Kgreflion whatfocver, on the part of the Uni
t' d States, or tht Â»i ns, is even allcdged as a
pretext tor the Ipirtt of hoftiluy in this quarter.
1 have reason to believe that every pra&icable
exertion has been made (puifuant to the provision
by low tor that purpofej to be prepared for the al
ternative of a profeeution of the war, in the event
a f*|iure cf pacific overtures. A large propor
tion of (he troops authorized to be raised, have
een recruited, though the number is (till incom-
Pete ; And paifli'have been taken to discipline,
2nd put them in condition for the particular kind
of lervice to be performed.âA delay of opera
t'Ons (hefides being dictated by the measures
'en were pursuing towards a pacific termina
tion of the w,>r) has been 111 itfelf deemed prefer
a!'<e to immatuie efforts. A statement, from the
proper department, with regard to the number of
troops railed, and some other points which have
been fuggefied, will afford more precise informa
t "on, as a guide to the legislative consultations ;
2nd among other things will enable Congress lo
J u ge vvJitther additional ftimulous to the
recruiting service may Â»ot be advifeable.
In looking forward to the future expense of
t. e operations, may be found inevitable,
derive confoiation from the information I re
â¢eive, that the product of the revenues for the
present year is likely to fupercede the receflity
â¢ additional tmrtliens on the community, for
* 1C ler y:ce of the ensuing year. This, howe-
* 1 ' *11 be better ascertained in the course of
on ; â-iind it is proper to add, that the
nation ailuded to, proceeds upon the fup
on of no material extenlion of the spirit of
< ity.
/ cannot dismiss the fuhjedl of Indian affairs,
v, tnout again recommending to your consider
ation the expediency of more adequate provi
â on lor giving energy to the laws throughout
Â°ur interior frontier; and for restraining the
c Â°miniiT)onof outrages upon the Indians; with
out which, all pacific plans mult prove nugato-
0 enable by competent rewards, the em-
P o.Vment of qualified and trusty persons to re
-1 c them as agents, would also contri
ute to the preiervation of peace and goo<
neighbourhood.
If in addition to these expedient?, an eligible
P an could be devised for promoting civilizatioi
'<*uions the friendly tribes, aud for carrying oi
- tr.-.ae Wiia then}, upon % foale eÂ«ual to their
wants, and under regulations calculated to pro I
teet them from imposition and extortion, it<
I influence in cementing their intereih with our"
could not cut be contkferable.
Tile prosperous Jtatc of our revenue has been
intimated.â This would be still mere the cafe
were it not for the impediments which in torn.'
places continue to embarrass the collection Â«t
the duties on spirits diftiiied within the â -United
states.âl'heie impediments have letfeneri, and
are lehening in local extent; âand as applied
to Hue community at large, the contentment
with the law appears to be progieflive.
But fymptotns of increased opposition having
-lately manifefted thenlfelvej in certain quar
ters ; 1 judged a t'pecial inteipofityjn* on my
part proper and advilable, and under this im
.pre.'lK>n, have iflued a Proclamation, warning
â¢againlt all unlawful combiratioiis and proceed"
mgs, liinng ebjir ul.ject or tiding tiÂ» ob
itruft the opet ation of the law in queflion, and
announcing that all lawful -Ways and r.-.eans
would be ftriftly put in execution tor bringing
to justice the infractors thereof and letufinr
obedience thereto. "I
Mealures have also been taken for the prose
cution of offenders : and Congress may be al
lured, that nothing within conftiiutional and
legal limits, which may depend on me, lhall be
wanting to aflert and maintain the just autho
rity of the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I shall
count entirely upon the full co-operation of the
other departments of the government, and upon
the zealous support of all good citizens. !
I cannot forbear to bring again into the view\
of the legislature the fubjeft of a revision of the i
Judiciary system. A representation from the i
judges of the lupreme court, which will be laid I
befoie you, points out some of the inconveni
euces that are experienced. In the course of
the execution of the laws, considerations arise
out of the It nature of that system, which, in
some cases, tend to relax their cfiicacv. As
connected with this l'ubjert, pvnviÂ£onÂ» to faci-
Mate tlie taking"us bail upon proVeffes cut of
the courts of the- United States, and a supple
mentary definition of offences against the con
stitution and laws of the Union, and of the pu
nilliment for luch offences, will, it is presumed,
be found worthy of particular attention.
Observations on the value of peace with other
nations, are unnecefTary. It \voa)d be wife,
however, by timely piovifions, to guard again ft
those a*fts of our own c itizens, which might tend
to disturb it, and to put ourselves in a condition
to give that fat,station to foreign nations,
which we may Sometimes have occasion to re
quire from them.âl particularly recommend
to your consideration the means of preventing
tho% aggresSions by our citizens on the territo
ry of other nations, and other iufra&ions of the
law of nations, which, furnishing juit Subject of
complaint, might endanger our peace with
themâAnd, in general, the maintenance of a,
friendly intercourse with foreign powers, will
be presented to your attention by the expira
tion of the Jaw for that purpoSe, which takes
place, if not renewed, at the close of the pjeSent
ieJfion. I
In elocution of the authority given by the
legiilature, measures have been taken for en
gaging some artists from abroad to aid in the es
tablishment oi our mint ; othen have been em
ployed at home.âProvision has been made of
the requiiite buildings, and theie are now put
ting into proper condition for the purposes of
the eftablifhment.âTheie has al/o been a small
beginning in the coinage of half difmes ; the
want of small coins in circulation calling the
fit ft attention to them.
The regulation of foreign coins, incorrefpon
dency with the principles of our national coin
age, as being eilential to their due operation,
arid to order in our money-concerns, will, I
doubt not, be resumed and compleated.
It is represented that some provifioris in the
law, which eftablilhes the Post Office, opej ate,
in experiment againit the trahfmlllion of news
papers to distant parts of the country.
Should tins tipondue enquiry, be found to be
the fa<st, a full con Vision of the importance of
facilitating th,e circulation of political intelli
gence and information, will, I doubt not, lead
to the application of a remedy.
The adoption of a constitution for the Hate
of Kentucky has been notified to me.-âThe
legislature wi'lfhare with me in the fatisfaftion
which arises from an event interesting to the
happiness of the part of the nation, to which it
relates, and conducive to the general order.
It is pioper likewiie to inform you, that since
my laijt communication on the fubjeÂ£t, and 111 fur
ther execution of thea#s feveraliy making pro
vision for the public debt, and for the reduÂ£tiou
thereof, three new loans have been effected, each
for three millions of florins ; one at Antwerp, at
the annual intercft of four and one half per cent,
with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all
charges, and the other two at Amsterdam, at the
annual intercft of four per cent, with an allowance
of five and one half per cent, in one cafe, and of
five per cer-t in the other, in lieu of all charges.
The rates of these loans, and the circumllances
under which they have bern made, are confirma
'tions of the high state of our credit abroad.â
Among the obje&s to which these funds have been
directed to be applied, the paymsnt of the debts
due to certain foreign officers, according to the
provision made during the last fcfiion, has been
embraced.
Gentlemen oj the House of Representatives,
I entertain a iirong hope that the Ifate of the
national finances is now fuffictcotly n>atured to
enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual
arrangement tor the regular redemption and dis
charge of the public debt, according to the right
which has been refeived to the government.â
No measure can be more dtfirable, whether view
ed with an eye to its intrinsic importauce, or to
he general sentiment and with of the nation.â
Provision is likewise requisite for the leimburfe
ment of the loan which has betfn made of the Bank
>f the United States, pursuant to the eleventh fee
ton of the act by which it is incorporated. In

JOHN MOTT.A DUBLIN ANECDOTE.
A FEW years ago, a woman who
rented a snug house in Dublin,
alarmed the neighbourhood wiih ;i
strange llory of a gholt, drelled as a
female in black robes, that opened
the curtains of her bed, lurrounded
by an illumination like lightning, and
with a countenance labouring under
fume heavy burthen, beckoned the
woman to follow her. f lie person
haunted, called in two relations to
sleep with her the next night ; but
they were also equally frightened
with, grojs.ru and an uncommon nolfe,
and left the house next day.
The occupier of the house flill per
filled, that (lie was not only haunted,
but threatened by the ghost ; and to
this (he made the ntoft foleinu oaths
as well ;is imprecations, and accord
in.'ij 10' k lodgings in a neighbou
ing fti eet.
The Itory having abroad, linn
lreds were daily drawn by curiofits
into the ft reel where the hannied
house wag : and it becoming the tub
jert (ifconverfation everywhere, Mr,
Nolnn so well known for hispoe'ic.il
and political abilities, took up a (port
ing; bet, that he would fnffer himfclf
to he locked up in the house one whole
night, without the company of any
human being. About nine o'clock
he went, and was flint up ; but for
the fake-cf defence agninfi any iu>
proper practices, he took with him a
dog and a cafe of loaded piltols, and
was not released till fx o'clock next
morning, when he was found by his
companions fad asleep.
The following elegant ftanzss will
belt (hew the fit nation of his mind
durirg the time of his vigils, Suffice
it to fay, he saw no ghost, though he
heard a great deal of noise, and loud
ly threatened to /hoot the si.st one
who fliould approach hiin, whether
of this world or of ihe other. This
discreet gholl defifled, and the people
got rid of their fears in that neigh
bourhood.

Beftdes the maps in the Britipi editions, this
work' will contain maps Â»f as many of the Unit d States
as can be readih procured, executed by the bej\ engrav
ers in the United States.
111. The price of each number will he a quar

vance required.
IV. The work will be put to press as soon as
700 copies are fubferihed lor.
V. Sublet iters who disapprove of the work, on
the publication of the three fuft numheis, aieto
be at liberty to return them, and fhail have their
money repaid.
VI. The fubferibers' names (hail be prefixed as
patrons of (he undertaking.
Perhaps there is no science more entertaining
and ufeful than geogtaph\. It reveals the disco
veries of travellersâthe remarkable < tiriofitits ti\
all countries, in nature and artâthe situation ot
provinre.% cmcs, towns, villages, rivers, & moun
tainsâin fine, the hiftnry, manners, euftoÃps ] #V vs,
forces,' revent#ts, and government of d fTeicnt n>-
lions
If is an old observation, that 44 there is not a
son or daughter of Adam, but has fume concern
with geography and that a knowledge of this
science is indispensable towards the study of his
tory with advantage or fatisfaclion, Indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannpi difcoui fe on the
mrtft common ncwfp iper topics of the day without
betraying his ignorance.
So much for peography generally. With re
fuel to the present plan, let it fufTice to remark,
that Guthrie's Geography has been long acknow
ledged to be the heft in the English language :
however, the account of America in it ha , from
hvious reasons, bet n very erroneous and defec
tive. The errors of foi mer editions will be cor.
refttd. and the delefts supplied, by gentlemen of
abilities who have engaged to fupenn'end this
undertaking, and to avail themselves of all the in
format'on that can be procured, to render il the
most complete edition extant.
The Printer earnestly foltcits the support of his
fellow-citizen* throughout the United States: and
as no depofk is required, and every subscriber will
l>c at liberty to withdraw his name, if, on trial,
he should disapprove of the work, he hopes the
friends of science. and of American arts and ma.
nufa&urev, will cheerfully and earlv patronize this
ufefnl work, 'he greatest and most expensive, pro
bably, ever yet attempted in America, in the typo
g I ne, the Encyclopaedia excepted.
