FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FEN NO,
IN T every age peculiar follies have prevailed, and theprefcntfecms
to he distinguished for a propeniity to gaming and speculation.
We possess a country which holds out the most alluring motive:.)
to the ex- rtions of the industrious, and enjoy, at the fame time
the greatest degree of political freedom, both ip the piinciples
and administration of our government. But this is not fufficient
to content usâimpatient to acquire riches, too many of our citi
zens fnffer themselves to be influenced by an avaricious fpint, the
fruitful parent of the various paper bubbles, every day exhibited
to the admiration and astonishment of the public. Here is ample
scope, it mud be confefled, for the reprehension of the moraiift;
and hence we find the difcontcntcd declaiming on the degeneracy
of the times, and prognolticaiing the tuin of this young and rising
empire. But, Sir, tho' individuals may fall into these predomi
nant follies, and many innocent persons be thereb) ruined, yet, I
am persuaded, they will soon operate their own cure; and the
time is approximating when a fpcciilator or JlvindUr will be (bun
ned, as a dangerous and difhonelt character.
The affairs of New-York and Philadelphia, bring to my mind
the uproar which the failure of For dy re, the banker, caused in
London, about twenty years ago : Fotlijr qucm faciunt alicna pcricula
cautumâas a warning to others, I (ball beg leave to present to
your readers a few anecdotical notices of this gentleman ; it may
serve as an example to display the ill consequences of gafning and
fpeculution, and prevent some of out plain and industrious friends
from treading on such dangerous ground.
Mr. For dy c e was born of a very refpr&able family in Scot
land; he had several brothers, who distinguished themselves as
gÂ»eat and good men in their refpeÂ£live profefGons Being endow
ed with good natural parts, he was a most promising youth, and
aflifted in his education by Do&or Blackwell, a gendeman
well known for his writings in the republic of letters. He was
bred a hosier at Aberdeen; but this being too confined a scene
for the extent of his abilities, he soon quitted it, and repaired to
London, as the great mart for genius, where he soon obtained em
ployment in the capacity of an out-door cleik to MefTrs. B. & Co.
bankers. Here he displayed a great facility in figures, and an un
common attention to that business, in which he afterwards became
so eminent and confplcuous. H s employers being convinced of
Mr. For dyce's talents and abilities, and judging he would be a
very ufeful partner, and manage the most laborious part of their
business, admitted him upon the firm qf the house, threugh the
interest and recommendation of a friend. Scarce had he been
thus eftabliftied, before he began to speculate in the Alley for
very considerable sums, and was judged in the beginning to be
vei y fuccefsfu!, particularly at the time of-'he signing the prelimi
naries of the peace in of which he gained intelligence be
fore the generality of the Bulls and Bears at Jonathan's Coffee-
House.
This success wa<? fatal to Mr. Forhyceâfor it induced hiin
not only to speculate for Jlill larger sums in the Alley, but in many
other purfutts, particularly in hops. The capricious goddess dill
favored him, and he feemcd so infatuated with her kindness, as to
think she was entirely at his command. Ke purchased a large
estate, with a most elegant villa, at koehampton, where he aimed
at furpafiing commiflaries & nabobs,in grandeur and magnificence.
He supported a chapel for hirofcU and family, adjoining to his
mansion ; his ambition was now unbounded, he loarcd far beyoqd
the line of mere mercantile splendor, and nothing less than nobi
lity seemed equal to his wishes. The next tcft-monial he gave of
his desire of exaltation, was his being a candidate Tor a certain
Borough ; upon which occasion, though he was not retained, he
spent near 14,000 fieri. and to secure hisfutuieejection, ere&ed
an hospital, and eftabliihed other charities there, in order to ren
der himfelf the popular candidate upon the firft vacancy. Fail
in this attempt to obtain a feat in Parliament, he fought for ho
nours in another channel, and paid his addrefles to a lauy of qua
lity, who, dazzled by his pomp and apparent fortune, consented
10 the marriage; and Lady M was now frequently intro
duced to the public in the papers, her portrait displayed at the
exhibition, and her picture in every print-fnop. He made a hand
some settlement upon her Ladyship, and is favd to have purchased
fonre estates in Scotland, to give him weight and dignity in his
native country.
But the fatal period now approached when all his tinsel glories
vaniflied. The affair of Faulkland Island, which occasioned
Stocks greatly to flu&uate, gave the most sensible shock to his
finances; and to make up his Jpccult.tivt dijfercnct.s, he was com
pelled to employ a very considerable sum ot '.he Company's Stock.
This step alarmed the partners, and they remonftrated'to him upon
the impropriety of his conduct. Mr. Fordyci treated th re
monflrance of his partners with.the most mortifying contempt,
threatening to difiolve the partnership, if they attempted to re
strain his operations, and leave them to manage a bufinffs to
which they were altogether unequal; and to convince them thar
he had power to put his threats in execution, produced bank notes
;o a great amount, which had been borrowed for a few hours to
answer his purpose. Equally (buck with the piaufibility of his
discourse, and the sum, they were ea&ly reconciled. But Mr.
v ordyce's ijl fortune now pursued H*m as rapidly and invarra,
blv as his good genius had before accompanied him ; he found
himfelf iucapable of fulfilling engagements, so very confiderabk
on all hands, that he resolved upon a retreat, after having em
ployed every method his imagination could suggest to oifcovei
some new rcfource. The immediate consequence of his absenting
himfelf from business, was a stoppage of payment at the house,
Â«ind an advertifemenr succeeded, intimating that the other part
ners were not privy to Mr. Fordyce's proceedings: however,
the whole Company became bankrupts ; the fatal infiutnee of
which afFe&ed a great number of other considerable houses in
volved with them. Such were the effects of gaming in 'Change-
Alley, and such may be the effetts of similar proceedings among
Qlirfrlvcs,
Many unfufpe&ing industrious people were entirely ruined by
this unlucky event. A merchant in the city put an end to his ex
igence with a pistol, on hearing the news ; a confidrrable silver-
had recourse to a knife; a lady, finding herfelf undone,
followed the example ; and a gentleman near Bloomfbury Square
became melancholy.
The following Anecdote is worth notice The dav before
Mr. Fctrdycb flopped payment, he called on a Banker, who
was a Quaker, of whom he deft re a the loan of 20,000 âOn
being refufed, and going away dtfiatisfied, the laiier callcd him
back, and said, 41 Harkee, friend, 7W-dice h2ve hint many, but
I promiie thee, Four-dicc fbail never rutn me."

With a V iew to render every fpeciej of gaming as detcftable as
poflihle, I would makeafew remaikson the unhappy faie of ano
ther eminent character. The lale D.iftor Dodd was univerfaliv
Tdmirtd and < fleemed, as a polite scholar, an elepant wiifr. and
-m energetic graceful prcac'ner. Charity and brotherly lore, when
recommended with the charms of his path.nc language, warmed
every bnaft; hi 3 hearers hung about him with admiration and
rapture! But, what a falling off! when we contemplate the fine
nun engaged at the card-table, and rattling the dice-box ! â'l was
gaming multiplied his wantsâ'iwasgaming led him toforgery, in
order to supply them, and forgery led him to the igneminitJm tree!
Religion saw it, and wept, and cried aloud 10 (nilul mortals, " Jet
him thatJi*nd:th t take heed, lejl he jail."
It was not inexperience, or tlie want of knowledge, that in
volved this celebrated Divine in the snares and infatuations of
gaming. I nave heard him prear.h against it like an Angelâbut
nreaching and a&ing are two different things. What pen can
delcrihe the effeffs of this odious vice better than his, in that ad
mired Novel, entitled, the " SijlersCaptain Thomas hid met
with a great loss at a gaming table; he grew frantic, and dcftrÂ«,r
ed himselfâhow elegantly doth Dodo refteft on this oCcafcoji {
" Rut do thÂ«u, if gaming is thy ruling and favourite paflion, Q rea
der ! not yet depart hence, till thou haft well conftdered, and di
ligently meditated on the whole tranfa&ion. Behold here a man
strong in youth, buoyant in health, and blefTcd with piofufe plenry
of this world's good ; behold him in an inltant, by his own hÂ«Â»nd,
cut off from the sons of men, and blotted from the book of life !
On" fatal caff hath done it ! Beware, and even now flop ihy hand :
thy all. thy present and eternal *//, think and tremble, depends on
those base dies ! This cafl perhaps drives the ball through th'v
diftracled brain, plunges thee in iirecoverable perdition, and
leaves a forlnm. diftrelfed and undone family, to ttrugglewuh
want and "frli&ion ; to languish in sorrow, in penuty and con
tempt. What is the pleasure that can counterbalance the/e ? â
Be wife and reflectârefrain and be happy."

FROM THE NORFOLK AND PORTSMOUTH CHRONICLE,
FtBLISHED A 1 NORFOLK (viRCINtA.)
IT has been stated as a fafl, and proved on the .floor of Con*refs,
by Mr. Sedgwick and Mr. Bou Jinot, and confirmed by a ma
jority of ihe member-, that discrimination was imprd&irable, be
cause the grcateft part of the public debt was in fi&iiious certifi
cates, and a revffjon of the fc?eral fpccicsof paper that conilituted
the public debt could not be adniitti d.
It was alio brought forward as Ihe moffc powerful and perfoafive
arguments agatpft difcrimmation, htcaule the loldier* had bffiii
fullv paid by the bounties they received at titpe pt their jhi
liftments.
This, however, waÂ« poor confirmation for the men who had
loaned-their money , nd rendert-d fupplics,and rijceiveo certificates
of ineonfiderable vaiue, forced on" ib< m by the* public, and de
preciated by,their aÂ£h, and compelled to part with their evidences
of the debt at one-sixth of t{Â»eir nominal value, tor a fuLfillencc
occasioned by a diminution of their flock and other property.
But ?s these gentlemen are unacquainted with military opera
tions, I beg leave to inform them, that contracts in time of war
are estimated according to the magnitude and hazard of the en
terpriseâand from twenty to forty dollars per month was given
by merchants for Tailors, according to the risque of the voy age.
And when a soldier inliftcd in the Continental army, he receiv
ed a premium from individuals for the risque of being killed, or
perilling in a sugar houfc in New-York., and apromile from his
courttrv, of fix dollars and two-thirds, as his momhly wages, if he
proved vi&orious.
If the public cid not owe the monthly wages, the certificates
ought not to have been ifiued; and if the oid Congress rffj-ed
twenty millions of dollars wuhout confederation, the new govern
ment ought to have corre&ed the error, and not compelled their
constituents to pay the full sum, with interest, in gold or (ilver,
because they had been purchasers of these demands at is. 6d. m
the pound.
This kind'-of public faith and national honor, being a new reli
gion, and Mr. Hamilton the grand herefiarch, it will be laid open
and fairly explained in an address to the people of the United
Slates, at their next ele&ion.

FROM THE COLUMBIAN CEXTINEL.
MR. RUSSELL,
Ton are defied to publish the following account of
the//os of the ship Columbia, of Exeter, late com
manded by Capt, Isaac Chauncey.
THE snip left Liverpool on the 18th of De
cember last for this port, laden with about
one thousand hhds. of fait, four hundred crares
of earthen ware, and about thirty bales of dry
goods. She made the land of Cape-Cod on the
loth infl. and took her departure from the Race
Point, about 12 o'clock : The wind being to the
southward, and thick weather, it wasjudged belt
to keep the south ftiore 011 board, and 011 the
weather clearing up they found themselves close
ill with Duxbury beach, the ship then hauled to
the wind to the northward, but the wind (hifting
to the N. E. (he could not lay clear of the Brant
Rock ; they then hove about intending for Ply
mouth, and would have gained that port, but
when palling a ledge of rocks, called High Pine
Ledge, it died away calm, and a high sea setting
diredtly on the reef, obliged them to come toan
anchor about 3 o'clock, P. M. on the outside iit
J fathoms of water, but in a quarter of an hour
afterwards the <hip (Iruck on the reef ; they then
got a spring 011 their cable, and cafling the fliip's
head off, cut away the cable and got under fail ;
deepning their water, they came too again m
SEN EX,8 fathoms ; but the wind hauling more to the
eastward, and the sea rising, the ship dragged
her anchor and again (truck on the ledge ; short
ly after the fVern gave away, and the i'alt empti
ed itfelf into the lea ; they then cut the belt
bower cable, and their main and mizen malts, in
order to getting on shore on the beach and fav.
ing their lives, but night coming on, and after
they had beat over the reef, the tide of flood set
ting in, they could not effect it. Their situation
was truly deplorable. The vefi'el, by the vio
lence of the sea was so rent asunder in many
places, it was dangerous to pass : one of the lea
men in endeavouring to get forward was entan
gled in the wreck, and was nearly cut in halves.
The captain, two paflengers, a feamanandthe
cabin boy were forward ; in that fituariovi they
remained until about 8 o'clock A. M. when the
seaman proposed to the captain to get ast for the
{hip went on the beach Hern firft, and attempt
gaining the (bore ; but the captain replied, that
" he was unable ro attempt it," and gave his
papers to the cabin boy : He then resigned him
felf to his f3te : The feamai. and the boy left
him, and jumped into the sea, and had the good
fortune to reach the shore. Wet an and fatigu
ed they crawled up among the bullies, w.here
they would have perifbed but for the exertions
of the two Mr. BurgelTes, who early in ihemorn
ing found them. The remains of the wieck
were spread on the beach for 4 miles in length,
and perhaps the molt di final that was ever seen
on this coalt. The following is the lift of the
unhappy crew that perished in the wreck, and
whose remains were found on the fucceediug
Monday, and decently buried at Duxbury meet
ing house, except the captain, two palfengers
and one of the seamen, who were buried at
Marsh field.
Isaac Chauncey, captain. Charles Roberts,
mate. Joseph Heldridge, Philip Heldridge, bro
thers, paflengers of Birmingham. George Dun
nells. John Sidney. Charles Hicks. Daniel
Buffit. Charles Humphreys. Timothy Harris.
James Floyd. Harris. James Weaun. Au
gustus Jenney; a negro.
John Charles Martin, seaman, and Jacob Tuck
er, cabin boy, were Paved^
Much credit is due to the people in favin-g the
things out of the wreck; a laudable spirit of
emulation appeared in them to preferveihe pro
perty.
Their humanity to the little remnant saved,
does honor to them as men and as christians,
and will no doubt be returned to thein double
fold, by that being, who, the father of compafli
on hjmfelf, admires the imitation of this exalted
attribute in his offspring :âNor were the liv
ing alone the objects of their kind solicitude,
No ! they became interested iti depositing with
reverence and refpetft the remains of the unfor
tunate crew with a sympathy which none but
the virtuous podefs, and none but the good will
imitate, they paid the last fad offices to'departed
nature.âLike the Samaritan they bound up the
wounds of the unfortunate living, and like the
founder of their religion, they wept at the tomb
of their deceased friendsâfor friends they es
teemed them.

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THURSDAY, March 8.
Debate ou the resolution reported by ast left commit
teeâThat the Secretary of the Treasury be direct
ed to report hit opinion to the Heufe, on the bell
mide of rai ftng ihtsfi additional supplies which the
public service may require for the current year
TWTII. SEDGWICK (aid that when the law was
-L J- palled, confirming the department of the
trealury, and making it the duty of the secreta
ry to report to the legislature, plans for the in,,
nagement and improvement of the revenue â¢ he
had fondly indulged the hope, that a great prin
ciple _ in the administration of the government
had been so far fettled, that it would not have
been called in cjueftion at so early a period.
Th.s principle he then and still nnderftood to
be, that a great officer fhonld, by appointment
for that purpose and an adequate salary, be re
ipoiiiible to the community, to produce to the
consideration of the national legislature, s uc h
lylttniatic arrangements in the intricate bufmefs
O; finance, as should give the highest afliirance
n (Vn lf P T C Â° ' ,ÃbhC credit > with the least
polTible burden to the citizensof America. Thar
if this great principle remained still to be de
termined, he ardently wilhed that we might pro
fit by the experience of other nations, and by
ou; ovn that he knew of no nation that fuffer-
Ed under the weight of a public debr, but had
found it indispensable to its welfare, to appoint
some officer, whole duty it (hould be to superin
tend this important branch of bufiuefs ; and that
without such appointment, it was impossible for
hiin to conceive that an orderly administration
of the finances could be effected. It was not long
since, that all America had attempted to provide
for the public exigencies, by the indigeited
schemes of legislating financiers. The effects
are remembered by nilâthe revenue was incom
parably less productive, and yet the people infi
nitely more burdened than at present. These
tacfls would render any other arguments fuper
fluous, with those who believed that experience
was the belt guide to well founded political con
clusions. But on the oilier hand, if gentlemen
were disposed to calculate 011 the data afforded
by imagination, and to build systems on argu
ments a priori, not only unfan<ftioned by expe
riment, but in opposition to all experience ; we
might render the debts we owed, which had
been juflly ftiled the price of liberty, and for
which therefore we were under the highest obli
gation to provide, an intolerable burden. For
he would run the venture to pronounce, that the
nieafures which-would reftilt from such a desul
tory mode of procedure, would create grievous
exa<fliojis on our conftkuents, disappoint the ex
petftations of government, and prove inadequate
to the support of public credit.
By these observations, he did not mean to de
rogate from" the responsibility of the character
of the House colleiftively, or of any individual
member of it. There might be many who had
fufficient talents ably to pi efide in ' the manage
ment of our finances, provided their minds were
confined to the contemplation of that fubje<ft a
lone. But it Should fee remembered that while
separated in the recess of the legifl.itnre, the avo
cations of profeffions, or other business, left to
moll: of the members but li ttle leisure for the in
vefligation of political questions. That while in
session, they were obliged to pay attention to e
very fubjeift of legiflaiion .committed to the na
tional government. That considering the limit
ted faculties of the human mind, he'did think
gentlemen (hould feel themselves wounded in
reputation, by the supposition that they were not
colledively, minutely acquainted with every
branch of feience, a knowledge of which might
be involved in the fubjecfts of our legislation.
Without such aii extent of information and fci
ence, a.man might be an excellent legislator.
Otherwise the business of popular legislation "muff
altogether cease, or be very badly managed. It
would not produce the fmalleit uneasiness in his
mind, to have it, oniverfally known, that he pre
tended not to the deep knowledge of jurispru
dence of the Attorney-Generalâ the acquaintance
of the Secretary of State with the political inter
efls and relations of the communityâ or the pro
found knowledge of the Secretary of the Trea
fury, of the intricate fubjedis of finance. Yet
he felt Tome degree of confidence in the ability
.W'hich he pofTefl'ed, of judging of the expediencv
of adopting such measures as those officers should
recommend. " >
He observed that the House, ever since the
organization of the executive departments, had
conduced as if convinced of the justness of this
reafoniHg, by their frequent references to the
heads of those departments. That particulaily
when it had been suggested that the judicial fyf
tem required amendment, the fubjetf had been
refered to the consideration of the Artorney-
General. That when the commerce ofthe coun
try came under deliberation, it was refered to
the Secretary of State. That these fubjetfts com
prehended the molt important and dearest inter
ests ofthe pfeople. That he heartily concurred
in thole references, and would take the liberty
to add, that they had the support of the Â»entle
men who were now so strenuous in oppofnion to
the present motion. That if the House was i hen
right, those would not be wrong who were in fa
vor of this question.
He observed that gentlemen in the two cases
which in argument they had fupported,had'given
very opposite opinions of the collective character
of themembers of the House ; when they were
confideringthem solely devifmg the ways and
means neceflary to supply the deficiency of the
revenue, they gave them all the qualities of pro
found financiers. But when they were to confi
tlle re PÂ°> ts of the Secretary they became at
once transformed into resistless dupes, incapable
ot manly investigation and quietly failing down
the llream of ministerial influence. Did o-entle
men feel, he aflced, in the latter in fiance the
w.int oi that independence of /pirit which is ne
ceflary to enable them to investigate and decide
for themselves ? If so they would want much of
that greatness of character which would enable
them in the former cafe to afor the public be
nefir. r
H e observed that it appeared by what gentle
men had fa id during the course of rtie debate
that members were not to be abfolutelv rellritf.

implied neither project nor appropriation. Thi
gentleman had given in. detail :he several nro
ceedings which ought to take place to obtau on
one hand the benefit of the knowledge of theSe
ci etary, and to maintain on the other the inde
pendency of the House. Thus according t0 hi ,'
plan was the business to be pursued. TheHoj -
was in the firft place to call on the Secretary for
a Irate of fads ; it was then to resolve itfelf into
a committee of the whole to form opinions these
opinions were then to be referred to the Secre
tary, for him to report, refpeding them a fyf
rematic arrangement. Let this scheme.so far as
it is intelligible,be examined. Fir (I the Houfeis
co obrain from the Secretary a Itate of iVt;
The House had been left to conjetfure to what
fubjeifts those fads were to relaieâwe already
knew the deficiency to be provided forâthefub
jeds of revenueâfucli as were pre-occupied, and
-Inch as dill remained untouchedâwe also knew
how far those which had been occupied were
productive. These fads were already known ;
we must not receive any opinions or argument*',
jive deductions refpetfting them ; this would go
in deftrudion of the independence and parity of
the House, and some gentlemen feetned to sup
pose to the subversion of liberty. The facts
whatever they might be were to be referred to a
committee of the whole, who as financiers were
to form opinions refpeding them âand those
opinions were to be sent to the Secretary for a
systematic arrangement, and this systematic ar
rangement was to be made without
any opinion. How this was to be 1 done tiie gen
tlemen had not been pleased to declare ; we on
ly know that no opinions were tobe recommend
ed to the adoption of the House. This was the
dreadful enemy to our independence and free
dom that, was to be avoided with the utmolt cau
tion. He himfelf had hitherto supposed that a
systematic arrangement for ihe execution of a
complicated and intricate fubjed could not lie
made without fuggefiing many opinions. That
he helieved this lingular and as yet inexplicable
scheme of forming systematic a rrangements with
out opinions would be as cut ions as it would be
new in pradice.
He (aid no gentleman could doubt but tliat the
plans of the mini Iter would find their way into
the House, if regularly introduced as they bad
hitherto been ; the officer whoever he might bt,
would be responsible at lead in reputation to
America and to the world, which alone would
form the strongest motives to industry jind integ
rity, in the various plans he (hould recommend.
That it appeared to him that gentlemen who so
ftrennoufly opposed the present motion, would,
if they fliould succeed in their wilhes, destroy
mod of the benefits intended by the iuftitution
of the office of Secretary of the 1 realury, and
wholly screen the officer from every species of
responsibility.
Mr. Goodhue supported the referenceâhe ge
nerally remarked that in his opinion the mo.t
eligible mode to be adopted for raising the fop
plies on the present occasion would be by way of
loan. He then entered into a confederation o
the various obje<fts which ought to be wihin the
knowledge of every man who pretends to manage
the finances of a country âhere lie iaid that he
did not think it any derogation from the c. a
rarter of anv member of the House to fuppoie
that they were less competent to a thorough in
veltigarion of fifcal arrangements than an in' l
vidual who had made the fubjedt the par tit" a
object of his study and attention ; the mischiev
ous consequences of committing these nirange
ments to numbers had been Severely ielt in 0111

presentatives shall be apportioned among thefe

the states, will yield the number and allotment
of representatives of the bill.

that the number of representatives shall not ex
ceed one for every 30,000, which leftrktion is,
by the context and by fair and - obvious construc
tion, to be applied to the feparateand refpedtive
nuntbers of the state? ; and the bill has allotted
to eight of the states more than one for 30,000.

the editor has added Miss More's Â£ flaysâMrs. Chapone's letters
on the government of the temper âand Swift's letter to a young
lady newly married. These have confideiably enhanced its value,
and he doubts not, the ladies on this fide of the Atlantic will be as
generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their ad
vantage as those in England and Ireland have been.

THE SEAT of the late Dodtor Leivij Johtiftiti,
deceased, in Perth-Ambby, containing TWO HUNbRED
ACRES of LAND.
This place is bounded southerly for near a mile on the river
Raritan, w here it empties into the bav about 18 miles Irom Sandy-
Hook, and affords two mod agreeable situations for Gentlemens'
Seats. There are now on it, two brick houses, with gardens, and
a good colleftifm of fruit trees of the best kinds. The land is very
fertile, and a great part of it very good meadow ; and from its situ
ation on the river, has t,he advantage of fifli of different kinds, in
their seasons, particularly of oyftcrs and chicken clams, which may
be picked in great plenty on the fhts before the doors. It is a
delightful, healthy Situation, capable of genteel and tally improve
ments; and as Perth-Amboy is one of the best sea-ports in the
States, and within 18 miles of the fca, the prolpeft ot its
increasing in value from that circumstance, is by no means incon
fidcrable.
There will alio be told, other Lots, within the bounds of the
city, and about Five Hundred Acres of Land on the oppofile fide
â of the river Raritanâpart of which is improved by a farm on
. which there is a framed d welling-houfe and barn, with an orchard
of grafted apple trees, and will contain about one hundred and
fifty acres ; the remainder will be fold in convenient lots, well
wooded and timbered, and very convenient for supplying 'New-
York and other markets with fire-wood, timber for ship build
ing, and other uses, the transportation by water being easy and
hfe- The conditions will be made known at the day of sale
aud the lequifite conveyances made by '
JAMES PARKER and) _ .
BOWES REED, \ Trultees tothe said Estate.

ELEVEN ACRES of LAND, adjoining the above, the pro
perty of the Proprietors of Ealt New- Jersey, wheieon the pro

hardly to be equalled ; it affords a grand profpeft of Raritan
Bay, and of ihe Bay formed by the waters of Raritan and Hud
son's rivers, where ihey disembogue into the sea to the tadâand
a moftdel.ghtf.il one of the serpentine courleof the Raritanrivcr
for several miles, through a rich tract of meadow to the Weft'
The great quantity of (lone neatly dressed, and brick, the remains
of the hou(e lately burned, will be nearly Efficient for a new
biwlding; and a large stone cistern, and well of excellent water
with a very convenient stable and coach-house, will greatly lessen
the expence of putting the place in order for the residence of a
gentleman.âThere are tew situations so eligible, particularlv in
the Tummcr season-when the cool sea breezes, and thr elevated
situations, render them places of pleaf.ng retreat, from the confine
ment and fu try air of the fouihern states and neighbouring cities.

off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The oiher
part, bounded by the said street on the east, and by the river cm

anon and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of ihe moll
beautiful and deferable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a

veral years pad, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, bcfidcs
supporting through the fumraer season twenty to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper fealous,
with great plenty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frefh watet
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both of whicn
may aflord a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well 3s a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his tabic. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is indofed and dividqi
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar pofls.
and rails of ch- fnut and white cedar. The purchaser may have
the improved square separately, or the whole together, as may
befl suit him. There is an inexhaustible quantity of good build
ing flone on the river shore. The puichafe money, if well secured,
and the intercft punctually paid, will not be fieniandtd foi maayr
