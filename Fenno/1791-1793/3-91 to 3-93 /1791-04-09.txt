" A renown, acquired by error, is a phantom of
glory, that is driven away by the firjl rays of truth
and reason."
SO ftronga paflion, as the love of fame, when
flowing in a direction, which virtue does
not di<state, and which discretion does not con
trol, nuift become <i fruitful source of anxiety,
delusion and mifchief. To whatever age or coun
try we turn our attention, we find that no small
share of the vices and mileries, with which focie
ty is difgracedor tormented, owe their origin to
a triifdireified ambition. And yet without the
forcible impulses of this paflxon, men would fink
into infignificance and depravity ; the elevated
purfuics of life would be suspended ; and hard
ly a glinipfe of science or virtue would shine over
the face of the earth. As the propensity, of
which I am speaking, exists more or less in every
human being, and as it cannot be extinguilhed
without eradicating the germe, from which
springs an immense variety of ufeful and noble
productions, we should nourilh it with care, and
shape its windings with vigilance and skill. From
a negletft of a proper cultivation, the sprouts take
an ill course, are choaked with weeds, and bear
a fruit that is useless and deformed. Remarks,
like these, however common and familiar they
may be, can often be repeated with some degree
of utility ; because the most obvious truths are
generally the most interesting ; and it is rather
to awaken the attention, than to afford instruc
tion, that eflays, similar to this, are put into cir
culation. If any perfonfhould complain that the
sentiments offered to his perusal are trite or dull,
he lhould be told that this is of itfelf a reason
why they deserve his inspection and regard.â
Those maxims, which carry with them the sanc
tion of ages, acquire a solidity and value which
are apt to be overlooked, merely because they
cease to be new and flriking. I: is not the no.
veliy of ideas, so much as their intrinsic propri
ety, that gives them a claim to be embraced and
carried into practice. Under this imprelfion, I
have veniured to introduce this speculation, j
tho at the fame time I do not believe the i eader
will confefs he collects one new idea from it. i
Perhaps no circumltance has contributed so es
sentially to the final prosperity of the United
States, as the just fentimentsour leadingcharac
ters have entertained on the score of reputation.
The ambition of our nioft distinguished men has,
in most inttances, been well-direifted: It has co
operated with the suitable means to promote the
public prosperity. There -are some exceptions ;
but the art and management, requifue to preferre
a character made of falfe materials, prove that it
is too difficult a task to meet with general success.
Moll of those men who have come forward into
public view, through any other medium than
that of virtue and talents, have been sent back
to the (hades of obfeurity, from which no new
stratagem can give them an elevation.
It will be natural to ask, how it has happened
that the affairs of the United States have been so
generally managed by defervjng characters, while
111 other countries promotion has flowed from fa
vor and intrigue, or foine cause extrinsic from the
merit of the candidates ? The remark in my
motto, furnifhes a Satisfactory Solution to the
qucftion. In this country the information of the
people is competent to invefligate the preten
lions of those who Solicit public honors. There
probably never was, nor will be, a race of en
lightened men so depraved as to prefer ignorant
and vicious magistrates to those of knowledge
and probity When a person becomes conspicu
ous he exposes hintfelf to a Scrutiny ; and if he
reside among a knowing people, his qualifications
at e truly estimated, and his destiny properly fix
ed ; but if he take a station w here ignorance
and ft 11 pidity chara<fterife the inhabitants, how
are bis qualities to be diflinguifhed ? The glare
of external pomp, the influence of connections,
pretexts of patriotifni, and many other adventi
tious causes, may palm him upon the world as an
extraordinary man, one who deserves to be
eiteemed and promoted. In such a fitnation,
how can his pretentions be Scrutinized and weigh
ed ! If the people are too ignorant and debaled
to perform such a talk, they must quietly Submit
to the caprice and oppreflion of those who govern
them. There can be little inducement for pub
lic mentobe at the pains of acquiring knowledge,

or cultivating virtuous qualities, where the bulk
of the inhabitants are too uninformed to efliinate
the value of such attainments. Nothing can se
cure to a community the blefiings of a wife and
virtuous adininiftration of affairs, but such a de
gree ofinformationdiffeminated amongall grades
of people, as can fairly examine, and rightly cal
culate the relative qualifications of those, who
seek fame and promotion.
The natural indolence of the human mind is
routed into virtuous exertions, in proportion as
motives of responsibility are heightened by the
circumfpecftion and wisdom of a discerning com
munity. But where such attributes do not pre
vail, it is easy to conje<fture that the love of cafe
and pleasure will prevent public officers from
maturing their talents and virtues, since they
have no occasion to go through so irksome a trial.
Men, in purfuic of fame, will acquire it in that
mode which fubjetfs them to the feweft efforts
of undemanding; and where falfliood or igno
rance will attain the object there can be no (ti
mulus to severe application. A celebrated wri
ter asks, " Where is the philosopher, that to
premote his own reputation, would not willing
ly deceive the whole human race. An ingenious
falfliood will pals current among a servile, illi
terate people, and for a while seem fair to im
mortalizethenameofitsinventorbut addsthe
writer above quoted, " such aonedeceives him
felf; truth alone can have a durable fuccefe."
Error can assume no disguise that will not soon
er or later be detected ; and the air-built hopes
of fallacious projectors vanilh at the approach
of reason and science. These reflections (hew
the importance of eftablilhing the means of edu
cation in all parts of the country. Such an ex
pedient will try the characters of men, and those
who have risen into diftindtion, by impressing
falfe or exaggerated opinions of their talents,
will have their career checked. Those gilded
bubbles,which dazzle an ignorant multitude,will
appear vain and ridiculous when the light of
truth beams over society. The world has been
too longamufed whh an idea that the pageantry
of courts, and the mysteries of religion were ef
fcntial to the proper government of mankind.
It is no doubt true, that the fanftions of religi
on, and the dignified Rations of public men,con
tribute to produce subordination and virtue in
society ; but these may be founded on a rational
balls, and are something different from fuperlti
tion or despotism. A blind attachment and love
to an object that does not deserve admiration,
does not seem, by the conllitution of nature, to
be the best method to draw people to their duty.
Let truth and reason have a fair chance, and
men will be obedient to law without being slaves,
and attentive to religion, without being bigots.
CONGRESS.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES
SATURDAY, Feb. 7.
The BANK BILL under consideration,
MR. GERRY,
SAID he should principally confine himfelf to
the objections of the gentleman firft up from
Virginia, (Mr. Madison) not from a difrefpe<ft to
the observations of other gentlemen in the oppo
sition, but because he considered their arguments
as grafts on the original stock of those urged by
the gentleman alluded to, and if the trunk fell,
its appendages must fall also.
The ohje<fls of t he bill, he said, were to render
the fifcal adminillratioH fuccefsfulâto give facil
ity to loans 011 sudden emergencies, and to bene
fit trade and industry in generalâand that these
were obje<fts of high importance had not been
deniedâneither had it been aflerted that they
ought not if pollible to be attained.
It is objected however that the mode proposed
by the bill is uncon/litutional, and the bill itfelf
defcÃive.
The mode proposed is a national bankâto es
tablish which, he thought Cowgrefs were as com
petent as either house were to adjourn from day
to day.
809
[Whole No. 20^.]
It is said that Congress have no power relating
to this subject, except what is contained in the
clauses for laying and collecting taxes, iinpofts,
excises, &c.âfor borrowing moneyâand for
making all laws r.eceflary and proper for carry
ing these powers into effectâand that these do
not authorise the eflablifhment of a national
bank.
To ascertain this, the gentleman from Virginia
proposes a candid interpretation of the conllitu
tion, which we lhall agree to, and he offers to af
nft us with his rules of interpretation for his
good intentions in doing which, we give him full
creditâbut as he acknowledges that he has been
long decided againll the authority of Congress to
eftablilh a bank, and is theiefore prejudiced a
gainst the measureâas his rules being made for
the occasion, are the result of his interpretation,
and not his interpretation of the rulesâas they
are not fandtionedby law exposition, or approved
by experienced judges of the law, they cannot
be considered as a criterion for regulatino- the
judgment of the houseâbut may, if adumted,
prove an ignis fatuus, that may lead to deftruc-
tion
We wilh not however, by eftablifliing our own
rules of interpretation, to enjoy the privilege
which is denied to thegentlemanâbut will meet
him on fair ground by applying rules which have
the fandiion mentionedâand as the learned
Judge Blackstone has laid down such, it is pre
lumed the gentleman from Virginia will not con
tend for a preference, or refufe to be tried by
this standard.
The Judge observes, " That the faireft and
molt rational method to interpret the will of the
legislator, is by exploring his intentions at the
time when the law was made, by signs the moil
natural and probableâand these signs are either
the words, the context, the fubjedt matter, the
effetft and consequences, or the spirit and reason
of the law." With refpedt to words, the Judge
observes, that " they are generally understood
in their usual and inoft ordinary fignification, not
so much regarding the grammar as their general
and popular use."
The gentlemen on different fides of the ques
tion do not disagree with refpetfl to the meaning
of the terms taxes, dutia, impojls, excises, ire. or
of borrowing money, but of the word itecejfary :
And the question is, what is the genera] and po
pular meaning of this term ? Perhaps the ans
wer to the question will be truly this, that in a
general and popular one, the word does not ad
mit of a definite meaning, but that this varies, ac
cording to the fubjetl and circumjlances. With
refpe<ft to the fubjetft for instanceâis the peo
ple speaking of a garrison besieged by a superior
force, and without provisions, or a profpedl of
relief, should fay it was under the neceflity of sur
rendering, they would mean a physical neceflity,
for troops cannot subsist long without provisions,
âbut if speaking of a debtor the people should
fay, he was frighted by his creditor, and then
reduced to the neceflity of paying his debts, they
would mean a legal, which is very different from
a physical neceflityâfor altho the debtor by re
fufing payment might be confined, he would be
allowed subsistence, and the neceflity he was un
der to pay his debts would not extend beyond
his confinement. Again ,if it should be said that
a client is under the neceflity of giving to his law
yer more than legal fees, the general popular
meaningof neceflity would in this instance be very
different from that in the otherâthe neceflity
would neither be physical or legal, but artificial,
or if I may be allowed the expreflion, a long robe
neceflity.
The meaning of the word " ncccffary," varies
also according to circuniftancesâfor altho Con
greft have power to levy and collect taxes, duties,
&c. to borrow money, and to determine the time,
quantum, mode and every regulation necessary
and proper for supplying the treasury, yet the
people would apply a different meaning to the
word necessary, under different circumstances :
For instance, without a fufficiency of precious
metals for a medium, laws creating an artificial
medium would be generally thought necessary
for carrying into effetfi the power to levy and
collecfr taxesâbut if there was a fufficiency of
such inetals, those laws would not generally be
thought necessary. Again, if specie was scarce,
and the credit of the government low, collateral
measures would be by the people thought necef
lary, for obtaining public loansâout not so, if
tit&othe cafe was reversed. Or if part of the States
ihould be invaded and overrun by ail enemy, it
would be thought necedary to levy on the reft
heavy taxes, and collect them in a short period,
and to take flock, grain and other articles from
the citizens without their consent, for common
defence ; but in a time of peace and fafety such
measures would be supposed unnecef'ary. In
itances may be multiplied in other refpetts ; but
it is conceived thr-t these are fufticient to fliew
that the popular and general meaning of the
word " neceflary" varies according to the fubjedt
and circuinftances.
The second rule of interpretation relates to the
context, and the Judge conceives that " if words
are (till dubious, we may establish their meaning
by the context; thus the preamble is often called
in to help the conftruc r tion of an act of parlia
ment." The constitution in the prefenc cafe is
the great law of the people, who are themselves
the sovereign legislature; and the preamble is in
tliefe wordsâ" We, the people of the United
States, in order to form a more perfecfl union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, pro
vide for the common defence, promote the gene
ral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and estab
lish this Constitution for the United States of Ame-
rica."
These are the great objeds for which the con
stitution was established, and in administering it,
we fliould always keep them in view. And here
it is remarkable, that altho' " common defence
and genera] welfare" are held up in the pream
ble amongst the primary objetfis of attention,
they are again mentioned in the Bth fetfion of
the firft article, whereby we are enjoined in le
vying taxes, duties, &c. particularly to regard
" the common defence and general welfare;"
indeed common sense di<slates the measure; for
the security of jour property, families, and liber
tyâof every thing dear to us, depends on our
ability to defend them. The means, therefore,
for attaining this object, we ought not to omit a
year, month, or even a day, if we could avoid it,
and we are never provided for defence unless
prepared for sudden emergencies. Should go
vernment be surprized in this cafe, it would be as
dishonorable as for a general to be surprized in a
state of warfare, and the event to the community
may be much more fatal. If provision then for
sudden emergencies is indifpenfible, it must be
evident that it will depend in a great measure on
the ability of government to command at all
times, for this purpose, a fufficient sum of money,
which is justly denominated the sinews of war ;
and how is this to be efFe<sied âby cmifions of
bills of credit ?âDuring the revolution, bills of
credit, it must be acknowledged, have done won
ders ; they have, in confliifi with the banks, trea
sury and public cred.it of Great-Britain, risen su
perior to them all, and have lince died a natural
death. We have honored them with a funeral
pile ; we now bid peace to their manes, and de
voutly hope that bills of credit will forever be
extinrfi in the United States. Are we to depend
then on taxes for commanding money in cases of
urgent neceflity ? These, as has been fliewn by
other gentlemen, will be too flow in their opera
tions, unlels, indeed, we should levy a tax for
drawing into, and locking up in the treasury,
three or four millions of dollarsâa law which
would be universally considered as unneceflary
and improper.
By loans, and loans only, can provision be made
for sudden emergencies : But if loans fliould be
made previoujly to an emergency, the people
would be unnecessarily burthened by the inter
est: thereof and molt of the other evils would en
sue that would arise from previous taxes ; and if
they were to be made at an emergency, without
previous arrangements, of whom are we to bor
row ? of individuals ?âThefe cannot be depend
ed on, as has been fully proved by our own ex
perience at the commencement of the revolu
tion.âAre we to apply to the hank already ef
tablilhed in the States for loans ? These can 110
more be depended on than individuals; for stock
holders having not more attachment to govern
ment: than other citizens, would in cases of pub
lic danger attend to the preservation of their
property by other means than loaning it to go
vernment. And moreover the united capitals of
all the banks existing in the union, would be in
efficient for government, for they do not amount
to a million and an half of dollars, and only a
part of this could in any cafe be reasonably ex
peified on loan.
Are we to apply to foreign banks or individu
als ? These, as has been ihewn, are too remote ;
and if not, we have not been able, without the
assistance of an ally to obtain foreign loans dur
ing the war, and perhaps the (fewer in whose as
sistance we may rely, would be hortile to us.â
Such dependance then as has been stated would
neceflarily leave us in a deplorable stateâand it
mult be evident that a previous arrangement to
aid loans in cases of sudden emergency, is neces
sary and proper in the general and popular use
of the term, inasmuch as any other measure that
Cotigrefs can adopt would be inadequate to the
purpose of common defenceâand what previous
arrangement can we make so proper as that ot a
NATIONAL BANK ? If gentlemen in the op
poficion know of any, let them produce it, and
let the merits of it be inveftigatedâfor il is un
reasonable to propose a rejection of this plan,
without producing a better. The plan proposed
by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is now
thefubjeft of difcuflion, does honor, like all his
other measures, both to his head and heart ; it
will be mutually beneficial to the llockholders
and to government, and consequently so to the
people. The rs by this plan will be
deeply intereUed in supporting government ; be
cause three quarters of their capital confiding of
funded certificates depend on theexiftence ofrhe
government, which therefore is the prop of their
capital, the main pillar that supports the bank :
Again, the credit of government, which is imma
terial to the other banks, is ellential to the na
tional bank, for the annual intereflof three quar
ters of its capital, which molt form a great (hare
of its profits, will depend altogether on the cre
dit ofgovernment, and produce, on the part of
the llockholders, the strongest attachment to it.
On the other hand, it will be for the interest of
government to support the bank, as well on ac
count of the benefits which the public will gener
ally derive from the institution, and the profits
arising from the shares of government in the
flock which will be hereafter noticed, as of the
supplies of money which it will be for the interest
of the bankto furnilh in cases of urgent necessity.
Whenever theft exifl Congress may lay a tax for
supplying the treasury, and anticipate it with
certainty, by means of the national bank. It be
ing then our duty to provide for the common de
fence in cases of emergency, the provision must
evidently be made by taxes, loans, or by arrange
ments for obtaining the latter on the earliefl no
ticeâand previous taxes and loans being oppres
sive, improper and unneceflary, the arrangements
for aiding loans become indifpenfable,and a bank,
of consequence, neceflary and constitutional.

\ ANNAPOLIS, March 31.
Early on Friday morning last, this city was
honored by the arrival of the Presi dent, at
tended by Major Jackson.
Intelligence having been received of his
intended embarkation at Rock Hall, he had been
anxiously expetfted on Thursday eveningâbut
the Governor, and several other gentlemen, who
had failed to meet him, were compelled to return
without tidings. The veflel, which contained
the chief treasure of America, did not enter the
river Severn until ten o'clock, in a dark tem
peftaous night. She struck on a bar, or point,
within about a mile of the city ; and although
Ihe made a signal of distress, it was impofiible,

men and timber were American, permitted him to display on
the bridge, the American flag. The noveltv of these circum

to oppose the pafling and repaying of the peopleâthisoccafioned
a J raca *i a Â°d the Mayor, at the head of the main-guard, endea

had fired, and killed several of the rioters. Mr. Cox was taken

By the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA,
A Proclamation.
Vy'HEREAS by a Proclamation bearing date the 24th day of
}/ c J anuar y of this present year, and in pursuance of certain
acts of the states of Maryland and Virginia, and of the Congress of
the United States therein mentioned, certain lines of experiment
were directed to be run in the neighbourhood of Georgetown in
Maryland, for the purpose of determining the location of a part
of the territory of ten miles square for the permanent feat of the
Government of thÂ« United States, and a certain part was directed
to be located within the said lines of experiment on both fides of
the Patowmac, and above the limit of the Eastern branch prescrib
ed by the said ast of Congress.
And Congress by an amendatory ast, passed on the 3d day of
this present month of March, have given further authority to the
Prcfident of the United States, " to make any part of the territory
below the said limit, and above the mouth of Hunting Creek, a
part of the said diftrift, so as to include a convenient part of the
Eastern branch, and of the lands lying on the lower fide thereof,
and also the town of Alexandria."
NOW THEREFORE, for the purpose of amending and com
pleting the location of the whole of the said territory of ten miles
square, in conformity with the said amendatory ast of Congress,
I do hereby declare and make known that the whole of the said'
territory (hall be located and included within the four lines follow
ing, that is to fayâ
Beginning at Jones's point, being the upper Cape of Hunting
Creek, in Virginia, and at an angle, in the outset, of 45 degrees
weft of the north, and running in a direst line ten miles for the
firft: line: then beginning-again at the fame Jones's point, and
mnning another direst line, at a right angle with the firft, across
the Parowmac, ten miles for the second line : then from the termi
nations of the said firft and second lines, running two other direst
lines, of ten miles each, the one crossing the Eastern branch afore
faid, and the other the Pjtowmac, and meeting each other in a
point.
And I do accordingly direst the Commiflioners named under
the authority of the said fir ft mentioned ast of Congress, to pro
ceed forthwith to have the said four lines run, and by proper metes
and bounds defined and limited, and thereof to make due report
under their hands and seals; and the territory so to be located,
defined, and limited, shall be the whole territory accepted by the
said aÂ£ts of Congress as the diftrift for the permanent feat of the
Government of the United States.
IN TESTIMONY whereof I have caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed to these presents, and signed the
fame with my hand. Done at Georgetown aforefaid, the
30th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1791, and of
the Independence of the United States the fifteenth.
BY THE PRESIDENT,
THOMAS JEFFERSON
$3" THE above location will include about four thousand five
hundred acres of land. The proprietors in the diftrift give up
their lands, on the condition of receiving, after the town is laid off,
one-half of the lots so laid off; and the President Iras the sale of
the other half, for the use of the publicâwhich will, it is said,
produce the sum of three, hundred thousand pounds.â
The spot for the public buildings is not yet fixed.
Philadelphia, April <?.
Accounts from Pittsburgh mention various depredations and
murders committed by the Indians ; 13 persons on the Alleghany
a few miles from that place have recently been butchered, and a
number carried into captivity ; this last attack, has struck a dread
and caused a general alarmâand the people aie abandoning their
farms and retreating to a place of fafety. Similar accounts are
received from Mufkingumâwhere the inhabitants arc now all
garrisoned waiting with anxiety succours from governmentâthis
we are happy to learn, they will fpeedly receive ; the recruiting
service is prosecuting with vigor and success, in this and the Eastern
Statesâand every poflible exertion is making in the war depart
ment to expedite the requisite preparations.
Monday last being the anniversary of their Institution, the Hi
bernian Society dined at Byrne's tavern, in Front-Street. They
were honored with the presence of the Governor of Pennsylvania,
the Vice-President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of War, the Attorney General of the United States, and
the officers of the other national societies. The entertainment
W3s splendid, and a number of patriotic toasts concluded the fef
tivity of the day.
We are frequently presented with an article from foreign pa
pers, under the title of '-'The state of politics during the lad
week," when the articles refer frequently to countries $00 miles
distant from the place of publication !
The TurkiAi garrison of Ifmael, which was butchered by the
Ruffians in storming that place, was at firft said to consist of 12000
men : This number is multiplied by two in a more recent account,
and out of 24000, 5000 only, it is said, escaped the carnageâ
Thus the red thunderbolts oj war are hurid,
And mad ambition desolates the world.
All the Barbary powers are arming to aflifl the Turks ageinft
Russiaâand in older to do this, have made a genera] peacc wah
other powers.

GEORGE WASHINGTON
England, Pruflia and Holland are now interpofing(heirmedia
torial influence to bring about a peace between Catherine an d
the Porte : How far they will succeed, appears verv uncertain :
The propositions made to the Emprefsgo so far as to suggest a r*-
linqnilhment of her conquests ; fluftied however with ifiÂ« great
success of her arms, she reje&s the mediation ; and this appears
to have been expected, for the several powers are making the most
vigorous preparations to enforce their propositions.
It is nearly two years since the foreign news-mongers began to
uinufe lis with accounts of plots, counter-revolutions, and mailj
cres, in f raneeâand their inventions are not yet exhausted : The
latest details under the London head, in fotnc of the papers, slate,
Thatihe consternation of the citizens of Paris, has for fomc days
been incxprcflible ; but on what account they do not know."â
1 his appears curious indeed, when it is confideied as chara&er
lftic of the Frenchâ
T' enjoy the prefenty and to leave to-morrow f
To find an antidote for its own sorrow.
Seasonable Remarks from a late London Paper.
1 THIS morning upwards of five hundred people paid for
feats in the galleries at Guildhall, in expe&ation of hearing their
tickets drawn, and to their infinite surprize not one of them is
twenty thousand pounds richer than he was.
" Only think, three twenty thoufatids !" fays one.âSomebody
must have them, and why not I as soon as another ; well, I shall
certainly get one of the little ten thousand four pounders, and that
will be some comfort at least ! -Hush ! God bless my foul, that's
mv number, it only Â»vants two figures of it blank
Thank God it is not mine."
The space below was occupied by dreamers of dreams and
seers of visions, ftrift observers of times and seasons : here flood
a poor fellow without a shirt, which he had pawned the day be
fore, to avail himfelf of early and cheap insurance, poring over a
long lift of the different ages of his starving children, having loft
his money, losing his time, in expectation of a miracle being
wrought to redeem both ! There fat a wretched woman, her na
ked shoulders wrapped in a miserable red cloak, anxiously iiften
ing for a number which fho had dreamt of and of which (he in
tenaed to continue d reaming so long as her scanty houfhold lhould
furnifh the means of insurance !
Another class of beings were drawing their own chances from
the pockets of such as the mania of the moment had not robbed,
of all before ; in the midst of these ingenious fpeftatois, a country
squire, in a marketable foi 'm 9 who had come to town on purpose to
hear his ticket drawn a twenty thousand, and who was Douching
away with the Hobfon's-choice comfort of a four pound prize,
had his pockets reduced to the ltandard of his head, for, havirig
loft his time, it was thought he needed no inftruraent to reckon it
bv, and having a four pound prize, it was imagined, that sum out
of his pocket could be no loss to him.
Those who have got prizes, afFefct to despise their infignifirancy;
those who have blanks, pretend that they never expected any
other; and such as have yet to wait the event of their purchases,
will teli you, though you ftiould meet them in the hall every
day during the drawing, that they are totally indifferent about the
matter.

Mr. Has well,
Th>following is a copy of a letter from Adonijah Crare, while in goal at
New York, to his relations in Rupert, as appears from its contents :
It came to ha nd by accident; I havefh'wn it to a number oj the prin
cipal characters in thir toivn y who wijh to have it infrted in your
gazette, as it may be of consequence in expoftng the villainy of that
club y and making the people cautious in their connexions with tlicm.
Friends and Relations,
" THIS is to inform you that Francis and I are well, and live
together very comfortably. I hope you are all well. I have not
heard from you since we received a letter from Lemuel; brought
by Old Head to us. Old Head and the Green p****g are good,
and give us what money we want; and stand ready to advance
300 dollars for our benefit, if requeftedâfor they are able and
willing: they have 3000 dollars, 111 cash, on hand. Thev have
repeatedlv promised that we should not want for 1000 dollars.
Mr. Spring is honorably discharged, and exerts himfelf for us.
Old Morris is out, and jud<*e no more.âThree evidences are heie,
two ot them you know. Desire Mr. Hafey to attend court, and
fail not. We fliall have our trial by the sth of Jan. desire the evi
dences to not delay the time one day. It is already the opinion
of the people that we (hall get clcai upon trial : and if our evi
dences come as I expect, I am sure of whipping tliem properly.
Our friends encreafe fact : attorneys grow mad in our behalf;
and our past ill-usage echoes through the city. Mr. Willard is in
danger of his life from the prisoners, because he is an evidence a
gdinft us ; and he has to keep in a room by himfelf to keep from
being killed : Many a time he hasbeen kicked down stairs.
I hope that Lemuel will take care of that Scott matter : make
yourselves as comfortable as poflible : I hope to visit you before
long, but God only knows when : but I verily expect to be
cleared. This from your friend, ADONIJAH CRANE.
