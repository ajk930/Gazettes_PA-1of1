A SAMPLE ORATION,
Very suitable to be -worn in the pocket, and delivered
at Quarter Races, County Meetings, or volunteer
Stats Conventions, as occafmn may require.
Men, Brethren, & Countrymen !
IT is the purs unbiased flame of liberty, which,
while ir consumes, (fill inspires ine thisday to
address you. As to property, I have none ; thank
heaven, I diverted myfelf of all yellow dirt, all
filthy lucre, in those blest days when I was a Com
mittee-man, and watched night and day, in pub
lic houses, for the public good,âProperty, gen
tlemen, is like " the accursed thing," touch it
but lightly, and let it pass. It is the mother of
aristocracyâthat lusty yonng (trumpet on whom
the wicked well-born are determined to beget
not even a moderate sized, a limitted brat, but a
thumping great absolute Monarchy.
The virtuous Romans had agrarian laws ; bur
our feltifh peafant-foul'd farmeis will not divide
their farms; nay, nor will they even divide the
annual produce of them, with those patriotic
preachers and apojtles, who take no heed for to
morrow. A N innarian law would be a rich blef
fmgâOh how it would gladden the hearts, and
gild wi:li pleasure the faces, of the true disciples.
to serve once more on Committees, whose bufi
jiefs it ihould be, at leafl once in three years, to
inspect the chests and coffers of the overgrown
parse-proud man, or the paltry muckworm, who
toiled with the dirty view of " laying up pelf
against a rainy day," and divide their ungodly
spoil amongtt the pure lovers of liberty.
A Numaria'n Jaw is not nil object to be despair
ed of. in order to gain the landholders, it is on
ly neceilary to convince them, that it is their in
tcreft to pare commerce ro the quickâto keep,
as it were, " its nose close to the grindstone"â
That the landed interest is one thing, and the
nionied is another, is very plainâYou cannot,
gentlemen, carry land enough in the largest port
manteau, to pay yotir travelling expences;âa
nionied man will do precisely the reverseâhe
will carry caflt enougli in a linall pair of faddle
l>ags to buy a large farm, and thus lord it over
us. Was there ever a patriotic land-holder that
(peculated anil grew rich, by land jobbing, by
loans of money, or loans of cattle, at an high in
terelt ?âYou all fay no, with a truth most incon
trovertible.
I have heard it reported that there is one Stare
Ji) the Union of no mem size, that would not fuf
fer land to be touched by that harpy the law. If
this is true, it is a glorious example, a noble po
licy. A new-made landed man laughs his mo
Jiied dupe creditor in the face, with virtuous
scorn. There is one evil that has been little a -
tended to. There is a kind of natural at iltocraey
anfing from the powers of the mindâNature has
given to some men enormous wealth in this way,
and when (lie adds to it that fpzciotis kind of in
tegrity which will not facrifice petty private
claims; or property for the public good, this arif
tocracy then comes to be of a very dangerous
It is a government of influence that does
not even require moneyâView the American
Court, and tremble. The head of the fyitem,
and a.ll rhe coadjutors, ought ipeedily to be oftra

appendage, the specious Court Printer, whose

T
X lIO' blooms no more the rose upon my cheek,
Tho' loft the hazel lustre of mine eye,
Yet does that eye my foft affection speak,
And gaze on thee, as 011 a cloudfeft iky;
For pure thou art, and full ot harmony ;
Bright as in heaven flhines the morning star,
So beams thy beauteous foul upon thy face,
And (hews no malice, or-no mental war
Moves in thy mind, to break thy blifsful peace.
But oh my Anna, with thy wonted grace,
Continue still my pensive foul to chear,
Watch o'er my spirit with thy tender care,
So (hail thy power bid the rose appear,
And light mine eye, and charrn away despair.

A PROPOSAL was made in the Natiiyial As
sembly of France, on Tuel'day lad, that the
Primary AHemblies lhould meet in two years to
declare their aflent to, or diflent from, the New

" The nation has the imprelcriptible right of
reviewing the Conltitution when it pleases ; but
the National AHembly declares, that its interelt
dire(Ss the exercise of thiÂ» right to be suspended
during thirty years "
The alleiublies of revision are not included in

In the lalt ministerial note which pafled be

The Minister of the Eledtor of Hanover has

the important business now agitating, and con
form to every thing which the welfare of the
Constitution, the dignity of the Germanic body,
and the duties of a ltate of the Empire may be
construed to require. The notification, however,
dictates more difcuflion and deliberation than has
hitherto been entered into on a business of so
much importance.

petlive Sovereigns to make known the follow
ing :
" That notwithstanding the glaring force
and violence which both preceded and succeeded
the a<sls ofconfent drawn from the King of France
to the decrees of the National Aflembly, yet they
had withheld their opinions as to the free will
of his Christian Majesty in the consent above
mentioned, but that the attempt made by that
Monarch to obtain his freedom was an undoubt
ed proof that both his religion, and his will, had
been violently forced, and that the formal ar
resting of the King, Queen, Dauphin, and Ma
dame Elizabeth, occasions grounded anxiety as
to the further views of the opposing party.
" That the before-named Sovereigns can no
longer forbear exprefling their feelings, and
declaring the resolutions which they have been
induced to take in the present fuuation of af
fairs, and which the honor of their Crowns, the
ties of friendfhip, and the earnest wilh for the
good orderand peaee of Europe, require ofthem,
and they have charged the undersigned Minilters
to declare in their names,
" lit. That they look upon the canfe of the
King of France as their own ; that they require
that that Prince and his family be immediately
set at liberty, and free to go where they please,
and to restore to his Majesty that sacred honor
and fubmiflion due from a people to their Sove
reign by all the laws of nature and civil Society.
" 2dly, That the Sovereigns will unite to op
pose and revenge any further attempts against
the security of the persons, or the honor of the
Kin gÂ» Queen, and any of the Royal Family.
" sdly, That they will not acknowledge any
Other conftituiior. as legal in France but what
has the unequivocal approbation of the King
given when he is at full liberty to ad; as he
pleases.
" And that if no such legal constitution is fet
tled, they will jointly use every means to put an
end to that spirit of anarchy and confnfion so
contrary to the regularity and good order which
it is the duty of all governments to cherilh and
support."
[Signed by the different Miniilers.
Sept. 7. The number of troops Jn Luxemburg
does not exceed 4,000. lu proportion as order

interior parts of France, the Aultrian troops,
partly to prevent desertion, and partly for less
expensive accommodation, have been withdrawn
from the French frontiers.
An attempt to effect a counter revolution, by
foreign force, mult now be the dreain of another
fu miner.
Cardinal de Lomenis, or, to speak more pro
perly, the Bifliop of Sens, is chosen one of the
members of the new French Legiflatore.
Thefufpicion that the King of Sweden intends
some hostility towards France, increases every
day in Paris, by the addition of some new cir

reported to have promised joining the German
Princes with 16,000 Swedes.
Sept. 8. The French National Aflembly has at
length fiuiftied its labours ill forming a Constitu

out having taken notice of the exiled Princes, or
of the governor to the Dauphin. 11l refpeft to
the former fubjedl, they have shewn evident fear
of doing any thing which may tend to widen the
breach.
We have the belt authority to believe that the
French King will not attempt to alter one tittle
of the new constitution about to be presented to
him.

An answer has been received here fronj the

being one of the fundamental bafesof the French
Conrtitution, their re-eftabliftmienr, underwhat
foeyer pretext, and in what form soever, is pro

11. Citizens of the fame estate or profeffion
undertakers, those who keep shops, workmen'
journeymen of whatsoever trade, cannot, whilst
they are together, aflume the titles of president
secretary, or syndic, nor keep regilters, pass de
liberations, or form regulations refpeCling their
pretended common inteiells.
111. All adiiiiniftrative and municipal bodies
are forbid to receive any address or petition un
der the denomination of a profeliloi) ; or to re
turn any answer to it. They are likewise en
joined to declare null and void all deliberations

deliberations, and enter into a mutual compatft,
to refufe in concert or to afford only at a certain

or their laborâsuch deliberations and compacts,
whether accompanied by an oath, or not, are de

August 2J
The question on the admiflibility of the princes
ofthe blood royal to the political rights of citi
zens, was taken into consideration. Meflrs. Gu
illaume, Voydel, and Roberfpierre, contended
that these rights should be obtained for the prin
ces, and that no difference fliould exist between
them and the multitude. Others affirmed, with
M. de Sillery, thac to deprive the princes ofthefe
rights would be to degrade them.
M. Goupil was ofa different opinion, and said,
that this exclusion would not prevent them from
being ufeful to the (late ; it would not, for ex
ample, deprive M. d'Orleans of the advantage of
again appearing at the head of our fleets. At
ihefe words an alarming noise took place, toge
ther with loud applauses, which formed a lingu
lar contrafl to the silence of M. d'Orleans and his
friends
Messrs. Barnave and Muguet endeavoured to
shew the absurdity of putting on a level with o
ther citizens, those men whom the nation had

decreed, 1 hat the princes should enjoy the rights
of atftive citizens.
With refpedt td their eligibility to places to

On a report made by a member of the commit

King's Comiuiffioner, adminiltrator of the extra

It was decreed, That the members ofthe King's
family fliould hereafter be called only by their

M. Duport moved, that the Constitutional Ai r t,
after being once again read over, fliould* be pre
sented to the King, and that no power on earth
fliould be capable of making any change in it.
After a warm debate it was decreed, on the
motion of M. Camus, that the Constitutional A&
lhall not be presented to the King till after being
read over, and a declaration by the Aflembly that
there is nothing more to add to it.
Notice was given, that two of the departments
had already nominated their deputies to the ap
proaching Legislature. A Member proposed that
every Legislator, on his arrival at Paris, should
his name to be inscribed in the archives ol
the National Ad'embly, " that when we fliould
have finifhed our labours," said he, " we may
know if our fucceflors have aflembled in fuflicien'

This proposal was adopted.Â£ D"E N T O N, October 7 .

This town was on Wednesday 1 ast viiirecl by
an unhappy conflagration, which has destroyed
its molt flonrilhin? part. The fire broke out at
noon, in the lioufe of Philip Roche, a tavern
keeper, on the county wharf. The loft of that
lioufe being filled with fodder, the flames fudden
]y made their appearance through its roof, and
aimoft instantly reached the contiguous housesâ
the wind blew from the north ealt. The (tores
of Mellis. Kennedy, Gerock, and Lawrence were
alinoft at once in a bl.ize, and had they been
blown up, all further damage would have been
prevented.
The fire soon reached across Craven and Front
ltreeis, to the old coffee lioufe, Mr. Donnells and
Mr. Thomlinfon's ft ores. Nine hoi.fes on the
eail fide ot Craven sh eet, and seven on the water
fide of Front ft r eet, were reduced to allies. The
jiorth-weft corner of Craven and Front Itreet,
commonly called Ogden's corner, was next at
tacked, and every hotife in both directions was
burnt down as far as the corner of middle itreet
011 one fide, and Mellis. Manning and Byrne's
ffore on the other were deitroyed. The two lalt
buildings were blown up.
Sixty-three houses were destroyed, as well as
an immense quantity of goods. Thelofs sustain
ed 011 the occasion amounts to upwards of one
hundred thousand pounds.
Philip Roche and his wife were last evening
committed to gaol ; many refiJetfableinhabitants
having evinced their appreheniions that tliefe
people (wbqfe house it isfuppofed was intention
ally set on fire) would again attempt to burn the
town.

And (up perhaps in Paradise.
Revolutions in government arc always attended with hazard,
and should never be attempted without a mauiteft pro f peft of
making that good, which was bad beforeâbut the miferv of the
business is, that the remonstrances of the people are frldom attend
ed to by rulers, till their patience being cxhauftcd, there appears
to be no other alternative left but that of obeying the impulses of
resentment and pafiion, which too often overpower the voice of
leafon and judgment.
In thecaufeof Liberty, it has been fa id, it is impious to becalm;
but is there any fubjeft that demands the sober, cool deliberation
of man, more than this ?
A just estimation of the precious bleflings of freedom is the re
sult of difpaflionate reasoning. How to fccure ctte&ually the in
valuable pofftflion, has employed the wit, wisdom and study of
the wifefl and belt men in all agesâand yet, alas, how many dif
ferent ideas diftraft the world!-It will be found, when all the
subtleties of logic and metaphysics areexhaufted,
11 * l is from experience that we reason best."

The annual reviews of the militia (that bul
wark of freedom) in Connecticut, Maflachitfetts,
and New-Hampi.iire, have recently taken place.
A correspondent observes, that it is of the ut
inolt importance to the influence and refpedtabi
lity of every particular State in the Union, that
its militia ihould be well disciplined, as well as
duly equipped. On the general perfualion of the
truth of this Suggeltion, and its consequent im
provement, will in a great measure depend that
equipoifeof Strength i'o neceilary to the tranquil
lity of the Union.
All enlightened people Will ever be attentive
to those nieafures on which the preservation of a
free government depends. Perhaps the interpo
sition of the general go/ernment is not more ne
ceilary in any business rtian in that of eltabliSbing
a uniform plan for the regulation of the militiaâ
lor without this interference, it is very evident
that the disparity in the relative power of the Se
veral States, already very apparent, will conti
nue to encreafe. This disparity may in time pro
duce jealousies, and injustice.

J The Althok.
CHARITY
13th Chap. \JI Corinthian!, verjijud.
THO' I enraptured wake the unrivall'd lyre,
Warm'd with the Muse's or a seraph's fire,
In various tongues fublimeft wonders tell,
Describe the joys of heaven, the woes of heÂ»lâ
Tho' I the lofty heights of faience gain,
And ait's and nature's myftcrics explainâ
Tho' fkill'd profoundly in prophetic lore,
With piercing ken futurity exploreâ
Tho' I have faith fufticient to ft flam
And hurl the ponderous mountains to the mam-
Devoid of Charity, 1 shall be found,
Vain as a fliadow, empty as a found.
Were I poffettVd of affluent India's store,
And unreferv'd dispense it to ths poor
Tho' I resign my body to the flame,
To gain a martyr's or a hero's nameâ
WhUe felfilh motives aftuatemy foul,
And every nobler sentiment controul,
Void of benevolence, I Hill remain
As nothing empty, as a shadow vain.
Celestial Charity, fuprcmely kind,
Illumes, expands, and animates the mind,
To noble and difintcrefted deeds,
Allures to holincfs, to glory leads,
Disdains each felfifh and contraded plan,
And feeksthe general happinels of manâ
Unenvied views the splendors of the great,
And honors merit in the humbleli stateâ
On human frailties cafls a pitying eye,
And heaves with woe the fympatnetic sigh
Weighs variant tenents with an equal scaleââ 
Exulting, fees, o'er error, truth pievail â
With pristine beauty reinftamps the foul,
I'eivades each paflion, and fublimcs the whole ;
Dispels each vile afFesiou from the breast,
And opes the regions of eternal reft
To efvery nation, and to every feft
Who fear Jehovah, and his name refpett.
Calm lefignation on her votaries waits,
To smooth the rugged paths of adverse fates ;
And patience mild, dispensing as fhc goes,
Her lenient balm, amid a world of woes;
And brilliant faith, each dreary scene that cheers,
And opes the feats of heaven's perennial years ;
Hence {"uffcring merit lifts a hopeful eye,
And views those happier scenes beyond the sky,
Where equity, enthroned, forever reigns;
Where endless pleasures triumph o'er the plains ;
Where friendlhip, love, and joy united meet,
And injured virtue finds a blest retreat.
Hail peerless virtue, lovelieftof the trainâ
Fair Charity!â extend thy mild domain
O'er everv land, till war and discord cease,
And every nation join in leagues of peaceâ
Till fin and error irom their (eats are hurl'd,
And pure religion luminates the world.
When art, when science, and prophetic loreâ
When various languages are known no moreâ
When final ruin o'er the world extendsâ
W T hen faith in vision. hope in glory endsâ
This godlike virtue Charity divine,
Thro' vast eternity shall brighter fiiineâ
Awake to praises the celestial choirs,
Aitune their lays, and animate their lyres.
Holy Bible.âRoyal Quarto.
MR. THOMAS, of Worceder, MafTachufetts, mod refpeft
fully informs the public, that he has this day completed the
Old and New Testaments of his Royal Quario Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE. The Apocrypha and Index, See. will be fin idl
ed with all the dispatch the nature of the work will adrair.
Such Gentlemen as hold Subscription Papers, he begs will
return them to him at Worcejlcr, or to him and Company at Bojlon,
by the lad day of November next, and as much sooner as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work has been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highcil approbation; both as to the execution of the
printing, its corre&nefs, and its cheapness compared with Englifti
copies of the fame size and quality.
As this very laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
is carried on solely at his own cod, he is led to hope that all those
who wish to poflefs a large Family Bible, will so far encourage this
laudable undertaking of their countryman, 2s to add their names
to the fubfÂ«ription.

AT this important cri(is,the ideas that fill the mind, are preg
nant with events of the greatest magnitudeâto strengthen and
complete the union of the Statesâto extend and pro eft their
commerce âto explore and arrange the national funis âto reftoreand
establish the public creditâwill require i\\c energies of the patriots
and sages of our countryâHence the propriety of encreafivg the m
diums of knowledge and information.
AMERICA, fiorn this period begins her national existenceâ
" the world is all before he r"âthe wifd.om and ;01l vâ
the mifrry and profpentv of the empires,Jlates y and kingdoms, which
have had.their day Upon the great theatre of time, and arc now no
more, fugged the mod important mementos âthese, with the rapid
series of events, in which our country lias been involv d, have
taught the enlightened citizens of the United States, that freedom
and government, liberty and laws, are inseparable.
This convi&ion led to the adoption of the new constitution;
for however various the sentiments, refpeÂ£hng the merits of this
system, all good men are agreed in the necefli y of an efficientfe
deral government.
A paper, therefore, established upon national, independent, and
impartial principlesâwhich shall take up the premif;d ai tides, upon
a competent plan, it is prefurAed, will be highly intereftmg,
and meet with public approbation and patronage.
Tiie Editor of this publication is determined to leave no avenue
of information unexplored :â He solicits the afliftance of pcrfons
of leifureand abilitiesâwhich, united with his own assiduity, he
flatters himfelf will render the Gazette of the United States not un
worthy general encouragement and is, with due refped, the
public's humble servant,
April 15, 1789,
(t. f.)
THE plan and execution of the Gazette of the United
States, have received the approbation of a tribunal, from which
there is no appeal.
The fubfenptions, which are encreafing, have long finee exceed
ed the expectations of the publisherâa punctual compliance with
the terms would compensate his labours, and animate his future
exertions.
The Government that an enlightened and free people adopt, is
a sacred considerationâit knows no party âand its prolperity is
founded 011 the public good.
While the people are just r .o themselves, the administration of
their affairs wiil be committed to men of integrity and competent
abilities ; and it will be the duty of patriotism to impress the pub
lic mind with favorable sentiments of the meaiuies ol govern-
ment,
Our country continuing enlightened and free, the period can
not be anticipated when a publication on the plan of this Gazette
fball involve a dereliÂ£tion of those principles with which the li
berties and happiness of the United States are conne&ed.
With refpeft to the circulation of this paper, the Editor regrets
the recent difcppointments which have unavoidably taken placcâ
he has always been fully inipreffed with the importance ot punc
tuality. and cannot charge himfelf with a fiigle initance ot ic
miffnefs.
It is very generally supposed that Congress, at the ensuing
feflion, will take measures to ensure the circulation of news-
PAPERSin the United States; and particularly their tranfnr.'lion
from the Scat ol Government to all parts of the Union. Juilice,
policy and patriotism, plead irrefiftably in favor of some ciiettual
provifiera's being made. The following pertinent and judicious
obfervatiows on this fubjeft, lately appeared in an address to the
public from the Editor of the Gazette of Maine. They
are substituted in preference to any thing which the editor of this
paper might further suggest, more particularly as coming from a
remote quarter of the Union.
Perhaps there is no country, in any part of the world, the in
habitants of which are, for may be) supplied with public News
papers at a cheaper rate than those of America. The Farmer 2nd
the Merchant, the Laborer and the Mechanic, may, by the means
of a public Paper, when he retires from the business and fatigues
of the day, take a view of the situation, the circumitances and the
various revolutions of the several countries of the civilized world â
And it mud be a pleasing.circumstance, that this is the privilege*
emphatically the privilege of an American.
44 Let it tnerefore be remembered, that by virtue of this privi
lrge, the body of the people constantly obtain and prefeive such a
degree of knowledge as (Tiall be competent to the prevention of
any attempt that may be made by cunn:ng and defigmng men to
,sap the foundation of our mod iuvaluable conflitution. But, let
the circulation of these Vehicles of Public Information becircurrf
fcribed, and the people will at once become uninformed of public
tranfa&ions, and the more enlightened Jew will engross the privi
leges, immunities and prerogatives, which in the nature and fi'.nels
of things, are the indefeafible right of the whole body ot the
people.
u It is piefumed no American will need a ftimnlus of this na
ture to furnifh himfelf with public information. The cheap rate
at which it is offered, the love and glory of our country, will at
all times promote such a mode of conduct, as shall forever bar tie
attempts of tyranny, ignorance and fuperilition."
