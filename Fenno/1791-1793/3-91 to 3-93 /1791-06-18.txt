A DISCOURSE OF STEPHEN BOETIUS,
Concerning voluntary Servitude : Or the Anti-One.
(Continuedfrom No. 12 of this Gazette.J
LOOK at the Venetians, an handful of people,
living so freely that the nieaneft among
them would not be a King; and all so born and
educated, that tlicy know 110 other ambition than
that of taking the molt pains, and having the
greatest care to maintain their liberty : thus
taught and formed, in and from the cradle,they
would not accept all rhe other felicities of the
whole earth, in exchange for the final left point
of their freedom. Let him who has seen these
personages go from thence to the territories of
him whom we call the Grand Seignor, and fee
there people who could not be born but to fcrve
him, and who to maintain him abandon their
own lives. Would a man who has seen both these
forts of people think that they both had the fame
natural qualities; or rather would he not think
that coming out of a city of men he had entered
into a park of be alls ? Lycurgus, the Legillator
of Sparta,, having brought up two puppies from
the fame litter, brothers suckled with the fame
milk, fattened one in rhe kitchen, and used the
other to run about the forefts at rhe found of the
trumpet and the hunting hornâwishing to show
the people of Lacedemon that men are such as
their education makes them, placed his two dogs
in the market-place, and between them a soup
and an hareâone of them ran to the dish, and
the other after his game : nevertlielel's, said Ly
curgus, they are brothers. And he, with his
laws and his policy, educated so well the Lace
monians, that every one of them would have
rather fnffered a thousand deaths than recognize
any other mailer than the law and the King.
I take a pleasure in reflecting on a faying of
the favorites of Xerxes the great King of Persia,
touching the Spartans. When Xerxes made his
preparations of a great army to conquer Greece,
lie lent his Ambafladors through the Greek cities
to demand earth and water âthis was the custo
mary summons of the Persians to cities to surren
derâbut he sent not to Sparta nor to Athens ;
because that of those which Darius his father had
sent to these cities to make a similar demand,
the Spartans and Athenians had thrown fonie in
to the ditches, and others they had compelled to
leap into wells, faying to them, that they might
there take boldly both of earth and warerto car
ry to their Prince. These people could not bear
that by the smallest word their liberty Jhould be
attempted. For this condudt, however, the Spar
tans knew that they had incurred the resentment
of the gods theinfelves, especially of Talthibius,
the god of Ambafladors. They 1 efolved to fend
to Xerxes to appease them, two of their cirizens,
to present themselves to him, that he might do
with them as he pleased, and revenge himfelf on
them for the two Ambafladors which the Spar
tans had killed for his father. Two Spartans,
one named Sperthes and the other Bulis, offered
themlelves voluntarily to go and make this repa
ration. They went, and on their way arrived
at the palace of a Persian, who was named Hy
darnes, who was Lieutenant of rhe King in all
the cities of Alia which are on the coaftÂ°of the
sea. He received them very honorably, and af
ter several observations, following one anoiher,
he asked them why they refufed the friendlhip
of the King? " Believe me, Spartans, (fays he)
the King knows how to honor those who are
worchy : consider, if you belonged to him, and
he were to know you, there is neither of you
who would not be the commander of some city
of Greece."â" In this, Hydarnes, (said the La
cedemonians) you are not capable of advifinrr
us ; because, although you ktiow the nature of
the good which you promise us, having had ex
peiience of it, yet you know nothing of that
which we enjoy. You have experienced the fa
vour of your King, but you know nothing of li
berty, what is its relish and howfvveet it is : but
if yon had tailed it, you would advise us to de
fend it, not only with the lance and the sword,
bur with teeth and nails." The Spartan alone
said w hat ought to have been saidâBut certainly
both the Persian and Spartan spoke according as
they had b?en educated ; for it was impofiible
that the Persian {hould regret liberty, having ne
ver had itâor that the Lacedemonian should en
dure fubjctTUon, having tailed freedom.

ODE,
TO B JRT HA.
ITH every changement of the vaiying mind
New feelings animate the mortal frame;
And new sensations of the body, claim
A foul to equal sympathy inclined.
See Malice on the face imprint
A dimpled smile, the down-drawn lip that fir aim,
Halt bend the brow, and place the eye asquint,
And (brink, with expectation, all the veins.
See pale Consumption o'er the Cage's foul
Spread idiot weakness, infantine distress,
Raise with falfe hope, with faithlefs joy controul,
With fancied, groundless agony depress.
While with invigorating health we tread,
And Youth, with dewy fingers, binds
Her Crown of roses round the head,-
Borne on the winged winds,
Imagination strays.
Wherever Nature's hand her charms displaysâ
â Be it to fee cc the rich-hair'd Youth of Morn"
Impearl the fragrance-breathing tkorn ;
To fee the milt wind {lowly o'er tie hill;
Or hear, from unseen bank, loud burst the gurgling rill;
Or Zephyr rustle fweetthe woodsamong
Whose thickets swell with mclod* and song;
To hear the voice of Industry resound;
The ploughman whistling o'er the loamy ridge;
The ihepherd's tinkling bell that talks around;
And hoofs loud rattling o'er the village bridge ;
Or torrents foaming down the mountain's breast ; â
There doth imagination love to reft.
But when the fallow hand of Sicknels spreads
Wan desolation o'er the human face,
No mote imagination loves to trace
The sportive beauties of the laughing meads.
But the drear cavern, and the darksome dell,
The wild faint-gleaming with the meteor's light,
The distant watch-tower's hollow-founding bell,
And tempests brooding o'er the inclement night;
Blue, sulphur-breathing, flames, from church-yard paths that rife,
Dim,*fhadowy forms, that dance before the fight,
The quick-departing flalh, that wraps the skies,
And horror's scream, the melancholy foul delight.
When deep disease hangs heavy on the mind,
Such sympathetic grief the body feels,
That he but half restores. who only heals
The woe with which the anguifh'd spirit
For health must give new vigor to the frame
Ere fofr Contentment can the bosom claim.
So, if the hand of agony distress
The fuffering body with diftraÂ£ling pain,
No earthly medicine can so well sustain,
No costly cordial can so truly bless,
As the calm foul, to providence refign'dâ
The steady sunshine of the immortal mind.
O then, my Birth a ! from the scenes
Where gloomy Contemplation loves to dwell,
From musing Melancholy's cell,
Your wounded spirit call,
To where eternal love the foul serenes,
And Heaven's own finger's 44 dress the dreary ball."
Read and reflect, refleÂ£l and read;
Make it your conftantftudy and employ.
The grand, affe&ing, solemn, truths to heed,
Which wake, of pious hearts, the moral joy.
These as you study, torn from dreary views.
New bliss shall animate your foul,
New strength your body brace;
With sweet delight the fancy trace
The lighter paths of moral dues,
And fee contentment light the mental pole.
By foft degrees, the scenes which former days
On your imagination pictured fair,
Shall rife, bedeck'd with joy-reviving rays,
And from your bosom chafe the monster Care.
Then Happiness, with powerful arm,
Shall wrest his poignard from Disease,
And from the features that were born to please,
Scatter, of felon Sickness, far the fallow charm :
Again shall bid health lparkle from your fye;
In every step bid laughing pleasure dance ;
Young Love the dimpling cheek with smiles cnhance ;
And Youth, in glory bursting from the iky,
W r ith Beauty's rich, inimitable grace,
Throw her celestial roses o'er your face.

FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS MAGAZINE.
Some account of the Cotton and Wool-Card Ma
nufactories, in the Co??imonwealth oj Majfa
ckufetls.
THÂ£ various manufactories of this Common
wealth, fini/h upwards of 10,000 dozen pair
of cotton ami wool cards yearly ; two thirds of
tliefe are exported to the several States ; they a
verage at the price of five dollars and an half
per dozen, and produce 53,000 dollars. Four
fifths of the whole, are made in the town of Bos
ton. One house alone produces 6000 dozen per
annum : This gives employment to at lealt 1600
women and children, who ltick them : If to
them, we add the great number of persons, who
are busied in manufacturing 30,000 flieep ikins ;
those who make 8 millions of tacks ; others en-,
gaged in the wood work ; and the hands em
ployed in cutting wire, and completing the
cards, this manufacture may be allowed to fur
nifh the principal means of fubfiftencc to 2,500
people.
About Ijo calks of wire at ajl. per caik, are
imported annually, which is all that depends on
a foreign source. There is a hope, that even
this trivial import will shortly cease, as some in
genious mechanics have in contemplation a work
of this kind.
The importation of racks, which at the com
mencement of these works, was common, is now
nearly abolished. The tack-fmiihs, within 20
miles of the capita), furnifh fufficient for home
corifiimption, and export ag r eat quantity abroad.
The manufactory of Mr. Giles Richards, and
company, is reputed thelargell in the Common
wealth. Their improvements in cutting wire,
have excited the attention of judicious Europe
ans ; and models of two of their principal ma
chii es, were lately purchased by ail English gen
'leman for nearly 1001. ilerling.
These gentlemen are daily profiting by r.e,w
and happy inventions, which diminifli the toil of
labour, expedite work, and leflen the price of
cards. The prefect year they have completed
machines for cutting of boards, which form both
the concave and convex parts, to great pe' fet rti
on, at a very few strokes. A lath is also invent
ed for turning the handles either oval or fiat, or
round with great ease and facility. At present
the works are in such perfection, that 8 men can
turn out 50 dozen per day ; and Ihould they lau
dably progress. in various improvements for two
or three years to come, as they have done for
the fame period pad, their manufactory may
justly challenge the known world, to equal rheiti
in goodness or dispatch in their work. His Ex
cellency the President of the United States was
pleased to honor the company with a visit ; and
exprefled himfelf highly fatisfied with their in
genuity.âTo his belt wishes for their prosperity,
we can but add our ownâ-apd doubt not, buC
they will be finally patronized by an intelligent
community, as meriting public encouragement,
fuperadded to private emolument. Z. Y.
FROM THE HAMI'SHIRt CHRONICLE.
MR. PRINTER,
Pis ast to inftrt the following, if you think it merits
,a place,in your paper.
TO THE PROMPTER.
Sir,
I HAVE waited a considerable time, hopingyou
or fotne of your correspondents would take
notice of an evil,very common ; but as none have
touched upon it as yet, I beg leave to lay the
matter before you, ana with your opinion upon
it.âThere are many farmers within the small
circle of my acquaintance, who raise barely grain
fufficient to bread their families from year to
year ; yet these men will run to the merchant
and retailer, and because they can be trusted un
til fall, and then pay in grain, they will rake up
twice as much gauze, cambrick, lace, &c. and
three times as inuch rum as they want. When
fall comes (and it will come once a year) a great;
part of their grain must go to pay up the mer
chant's and retailer's bills ; and by March or
April they are rambling about to buy bread for
their families, and very often go to traders they
have dealt with, and must give twenty-five or
thirty per cent, higher than what they fold for,
and mull pay the money too. Now, Mr. Promp
ter, 1 want to know whether these tnen work it
right ; or whether, as Dr. Franklin fays, they do
not pay very dear for their whittle ? J. K.From the Pouchkeepsii (Stateol New-York) Journal
Mr. POWER,
I Jtni you a copy of a letter I have lately received from one of my cor
refbondrnts abroadâ Ijyouwill give it a place in yonr paper, you
aill oblige A Coftomer.
" Dear SI R,
" T HAVE just now received vour's of the 10th irftant. I
X thank, you for your remarks on the work you have lately
read. It appears to answer in your mind the recommendations
I gave of it in a former letter. Nothing gives me more pleasure
in my time of life, than to he imparting the little fruits of my
knowledge and experience to the generation that is coming after
mc, Tho' I have but a few moments leifurc, I shall endeavor, tho'
imperfectly, to comply with your requcft, and K iveyou mv thoughts
on the writings of Mr. Adams, the Vice- President, on which you
tell me vou are about to enter.
As you arc on a course of political studies, which I hope may
hereafter render you a wife, a ufefui, and above all, an honest pa
triot, I would have you always bear it in mind, that you cannot
imbibe too deep an acquaintance, nor cultivate too an at
tachment to the general and local constitutions of the United
States.
The Federalijl, tho' written in haste, and on the spur of the oc
afion, is, as I have observed to vou before, one of the best pub
lications on the former. It is full of correfl method, found sense,
â¢and luminous principles of liberty from beginning to end ; and I
â¢have no doubt but the commentary will be coeval in point of time
â¢with the text. But the writings of Mr. Adams, mull be read
with forte grains of allowance. There is a great deal of learning,
and a great number of ufeful and wife principles of government
brought into view ; but it appears to me that he is attached to
ariftocratical and monarchical principles. My belief is founded
on an attentive examination of his writings. This great malter
of politics is frequently, and pretty direflly, inculcating a scep
ticism as to the goodness of republican governments, and a be
lief of the utility of hereditary monarchy, in terms which cannot
but excite in the breast of those who are attached to the one, and
who despise the other, a painful regret, and a lively indignatmn.
I wish to make a firm stand agair.ft such pernicious tenets. They
are a'sdirefily in the face of our institutions and manneis, as they
are repugnant to our feelings and happiness. Betides, it is against
moral fitnefs, no less than political duty, lo be conftar.tly infu
fing distrust and diffidence asto the constitution of our country. â
An unshaken confidence, 'a reverential attachment to our esta
blished f>Hems, ought rather to be the leflon of the schools.
In vol. 1. letter 20, of his Defence of the American Conjlitutions,
he observes, " The Americans have not made their firft magis
trate hereditary, nor their senators : here they differ from the
Englilh constitution, and with great propriety : Land is so equal
ly divided among the people, that they would not endure an he
reditary King and Nobility ;or at lead, if created, they would
be entirely subservient to the Commons, in whom nineteen twen
tieths of the property would refide.âln future ages, if the States
become great nations, rich, powerful, and luxurious, their own
feelings and good sense will dictate to them what to do ; they
Trray make transitions to a nearer refemblancc of the British con
stitution, by a frefh convention, without the smallest interrup
tion to liberty. But they will never become neceflary until great
quantities of property get into few hands."
Here Mr. Adams speaks of hereditary monarchy and aristocra
cy as not advifeable in this country as yetâwe are not quite ripe
for them, because of the too great equality of property. Here
after the natural progress of things will render them neccffary,
and they may exist without the fmalleji interruption to liberty.
If this change should be thought proper, Mr. Adams informs
us, we have an Aristocracy already formed for our purpose, by
the kind hand of nature. âIn letter 25 of the fame vol. he ob
serves, " There are sources of inequality in every society, and in
MafTachufets as well as in others.âl. Inequality of Wealth. 2.
Of birth. 3. of merits. And, 4. All these advantages of birth,
fortune, and fame united. These sources of inequality can never
be altered by any people, because they arc founded in the consti
tution ot nature. This natural ariflocracy among mankind, is a
body of men which contains the greatest colle&ion of virtues and
abilities in a free government."
Fame and fortune may be, and frequently are hereditary ; but
this is the firft time I ever heard a grave philosopher pronounce
virtue and abilities to be so.
In the 3d volume of his Defence-, and which costains a very in
genious and ufeful criticism on Mr. Ncedham's Theory of a Common
wealth, he observes (letter 6.) that, " We have adopted in Ame
rica one idea of Needham's, in making a fucccflion in our Senate
and Governors. It is still, however, problematical, whether this
succession will be the grand preservative against corruption, or
the grand inlet to it. There is room to hope, and groundsto fear.
The experiment is made, and it will have fair play. If corrup
tion breaks in, a remedy mull be provided ; and what that re
medy mull be, is well known to every man that thinks."â" In
â¢what manner annual elections of Governors and Senators will
opeiatein America, remains to be ascertained. It should al
ways be remarked, that this is not the firft experiment that ever
was made in the world, of elections tÂ© great offices ol State : How
they have hitherto operated in every great nation, and what has
been their end, is very well known. Mankind have univerfaliy
discovered that chance was preferable to a corrupt choice, and
have trusted Providence rather than themfclves. Thank Heaven !
Americans understand calling conventions ; and \ f the time should
come, as it is very pofjible it may, when hereditary descent (hall be
come a less evil.than annual fraud and violence, such a conven
tion may still prevent the firft magistrate fiom becoming absolute
as well as hereditary."â 44 Th s hazardous experiment we have
tried ; and if ele&ions are soberly made, it may answer wellâif
not, the people must again have reeourie to conventions, and find
a remedy."
The prevailing bent of Mr. Adams, in favor of hereditary go
vernment, seems to have acquired new force, as he proceeded in
his writings. In his ift vol. we have observed, he speaks of it
as a thing defirableonly at some future period, and not suited to
our present condition. Here he declares himfelf much more
emphatically in its savorâconsiders ele&ive governments as of
hazardous experiment, and of doubtful issue ; and in a strain of
exultation and devotion thanks Heaven that Americans can assume
with ease an hereditary monarchy.
Mr. Adams has lately obliged the public with a number of
periodical pieces, entitled, Dijcourfes on DaviU, and which, like
all his other writings, discover cxtenfive learning and superior
capacity, and are calculated like his former volumes, to point
out the neceflity of a balanced government. These difcouxfes,
however, arc constantly interrupted with his remarks on the na
tural love for iamily, and diftinflions, and property, and rank,
and that aristocracy and monarchy have their foundation in the
original constitution of our nature. In No. 12 he observes, " But
it (hall be left to the contemplation of our state physicians tÂ® dis
cover the caufcs and the remedy o: that fever whereoj our power is
sick. One queltion {hall be refpe&fuiiy insinuated; whethercqtial
Jaws, the result only of balanced government, can ever be ob
tained and preserved, without some signs or other of dijlinflion
and degree."âln No. after many arguments on the inextin
guifhablc passion for titles and diftinflions, he breaks out into
the following apoftrophe;âAmericans! rejoice that from expe
rience you have learned wisdom ; and instead of whimsical and
fantaftic projeÂ£b, you have adopted afromi/ing eJfajkMivards a well
ordered government."
Mr Adams has now begun, a discourse on Stephen Boetiui,
which will probably be the fame thing a: a second edition o. his
commentary on Needham. r
It would be easy for me to proceed with quotations of a
import ; but I trull I have already fufficently proved the truth
of m V assertion, and the justness of my belief in Ine beginning oi
this letter, thai Mr. Adams was attached to monarchical and
ariftocratiral principles. In faying this, T ave no c ire, I
had the power, to derogate f.nm the general repuia-ion ol his
works : I only wish that the falfr doctrines they contain may be
feparatcd from the salutary councils with which they are al led.
His writings have profoundedlv developed, and placed in all Â«s
variety ol altitude to the world, one excellent tru.h, long e re
known, recognized, and adopted by his countrymen in their po
litical fvftcms, and that is, the ncceflity of a div;fior, of the le
gidative, executive, and judiciary powers, and a partition of the
former into three independent parts, in order lo coiitroul the
fpiiit of rival (hip inherent in the mind of man. But his writings
have also inculcated, chetifhed, and propagated one abominable
ktrtfy, and that is, that hereditary monarchy and ariltocracy art
compatible with permanent freedom, and probably elfential to a
wife, happv, and perfectly balanced conflitution.
It is well worth observing, that Mr. Adams has undergone,
fincc his rcfidence in Europe, a very great change in his political
principles. In 1776, while he was a member of Congress, he
wrote a letter to Mr. Wythe, of Virginia, and which has been
recently published. In that letter he fays, " There is no good
government but what is republican âthat the only vamable part
of the Britilh constitution is soâthat the legislature ftiould be di
vided into two branches, a Â°d the executive should have a nega
tive on both ; but that the executive, as well as both branches of
the legislative, ought to be annually cle&ive, there not being in
the whole circle of the sciences a maxim more infallible than this,
Where annual eleflions end, there tyranny begins. Thcfe great men,
in this refpeft, should be once a year,
Like bibbles on the sea of matter borne,
They the* break, and to that sea return.
This will .each them the great political virtues of humility, pa
tience, and moderation, without which every man in power be
comes a ravenous beast of prey."
Mr. Adams ought to (hew us whether human nature has alter
ed since the year 1776 ; and what there is at this day, more tnan
there was at that day, to prevent a man who holds his feat by he
reditary right, 'Or (as .Mr. Burke fays the King of England hold?
his crown) in contemptoj the people, and who is not rejponfibleJot
his conduct, from becoming a ravenous beast of prey : Whereas,
the great leading maxim in all his writing is, that mankind arc
just as imperfect now as fo'merlyâin America as in Europeâin
this century as in ten centuies ago. But it is the fate of Mr.
Adams, in many places, t") be as inconsistent with himfelf, as
some of his doctrines are inconsistent with the genius of his coun
try.
The English government is that perfeÂ£l model to which al! his
observations are dire6ted.â" It is (fays he) the mofl stupendous
fabric of human invention, both for the adjustment of the balance.
and the prevention of its vibrations."-âBut the furious wars be
tween the two Rosesâthe constant tyranny of the Tudorsâthe
con (taut tyranny and convulsions under the Stuartsâthe two re
bellions against the house of Hanover, are rather bad precedents
in favor of hereditary fuccefiion. At present there is not indeed
the avowed oppreflion of former times. But the constitutional
tyranny (if I may so express mvfelf) of the hereditary part, has
changed its colour, not its nature âIt has laid aside its fierce vis
age, and aflfumed the livery of Venus and the Graces. Henry
the 8 h was a despot, with the iron rod of prerogativc--George
the 3d is a despot also, with the courtly sceptre of corruption.
I finceiely believe the Englifa administration to be as much under
the influence of corruption, as that of any government in Europe.
The House of Commons, chosen once in seven years, is a mere
mockery of rcptefentation. The English nation would have, if
justice was done them, their Commons fairly chosen by upwaids
ol 400,000 elcftorsâand yet a ninth part of the English repre
sentation is chosen by 364 votes, and a majority of the represent
ation bv 5723 ele&ors, inoft of whom have no property. The
House of Commons, thus wrctchedly constituted, has not been
able (as we might well fuppofc) to preserve its equipoise in the
system, and has submitted itfelf implic illy to the corrupt influence
of the hereditary department. Nothing but the independence of
their judicial, and the pride and honor of their judges, preserves
the remains of their liberties. The Roman civilians and judges
in like manner preserved their integrity and good frnfe long af
ter Tiberius, Nero, and Domitian, had infected their government
with the most accursed of all tyrannies. Mr. Hume, some years
ago, predi&ed (and he predi&ed right) that the tide of power in
England was running to the monarchical fide, and that absolute
monarchy was the true euthanasia ot the British constitution.â
This government, however, is held up to us as a model of wis
dom and imitation.
14 May 21, 1791
Mr. Adams has devoted the labor of years to point out the evils
to which free governments are incident, and to warn mankind a
gainll them. I thank, him for his learned labors. But Iwifhhe
would also warn us against the dangers of the opposite coast, to
which he is (leering our political veflel; aad together with his
commentaries on Machiavel, Needham, and Stephen Boetiusâ
would also give us his commentaries on the ieign of Tiberius, as
delineated by the mafteriy hand of Tacitus.
His writings have certainly the tendency (whatever may be his
intention) to make people weary of republican government, and
to sigh for the monarchy of England. To inculcate the dottrine,
that men are not fit to chufe their own rulersâthat frequent elec
tions are dangerousâthat diftin&ions, not of virtue and talents,
but of birth and fortune, are eflential to the order of government
âthat riches and family lhould be the titles to preferment, and
poverty the objeÂ£l of oontcmpt. Such dottrines I deem hereiies
in American politics. I am, dear fir,
Mr. RUSSELL,
THE late revolution in France, has opened
an extensive field of (peculation to the phi
losopher and to the politician. An event so af
tonifliing and unexpected in its nature, and so
important in its consequences, naturally arret

world. The friends of liberty and of man, have

the cords with which for centuries he had been

have been but one sentiment, and that, a senti

10 many millions of their fellow-creatures, they

tenfure upon almofl all their tranlaotions â¢ ThÂ«
other, the production of Mr. I'ain E) containing
a defence of the Afiembly, and approving every
thing they have done with applause as umlif.
tinguifhing as is the censure of Mr. Burke
We are told, that the copy from which an edi
tion of this work was reprinted at Philadelphia,
was furnished by the Secretary of State, and was
accompanied by a letter from which the follow
iilg extract has been pubiiihed in molt of our
newspapers. " lam extremely pleased to find (
" that it is to be reprinted here, and rhatfotne
" thing is at length to be publicly said, against
" the political hernfies which have sprung up a
" mong us. 1 have 110 doubt our citizens will
" rnlly a fecorid time round the standard of
" Common Seuft."
I confefs, fir, I am somewhat at a loft to de
termine, what this very refpeftable gentleman
means by political herefics. Does he consider this
pamphlet of Mr. Paine's as the canonical book
of poetical scripture ? As containing the true
doctrine of popular infallibility, from which it
would be heretical to depart in one single point.
The cxpreflions indeed imply more ; they feenj
like the Arabian prophet to call upon all true
believers in the J flam of democracy, to draw
their swords, and in the fervour of their devo
tion to compel all their countrymen to cry out,
" There is but one Goddels of Liberty, and
Common Sense is her prophet."
I have always understood, fir, that the citi
zens of these Stares, were poflefled of a full and
entire freedom of opinion upon all fubjedts civil
as well as religious ; they have not yet eflabliih
ed any infallible criterion of orthodoxy, either
in church or state : Their principles in theory
and their habits in pracftice, are equally aÂ»eife
to that slavery of the mind, which adopts with
out examination any sentiment tTiat has the fane,
tion of a venerable name. Ie Nullius in verba ju
rare ma?iflri" is their favorite inaxim ; and the
only political tenet, which they would lligma
tize with the name of heresy, would be that
which should attempt to impose an opinion up
on their uuderftandings, upon the lingle prin
ciple of authority.
I believe also, fir, that the citizens of America
are not at present disposed ro rally round the
standard of any man. In the full pofieffipn and
enjoyment of all the freedom, for which they
have gone through so arduous a conftitft, they
will roc for the poor purpbfe of extinguilhing a
few supposed political heresies, return to the
horrors of a civil contest, from which they could
reap no possible benefit, and which would pro
bably terminate in the loss of that liberty, for
which they have b=en so liberal of their trea
fnre and of their blood.
If however, Mr. Paine is to be adopted as the
holy father of our political faith, and this pam
phlet is to be considered as his Papal bull of in
fallible virtue, let us at lead examine what it
contains. Before we determine to join the
standard let us inquire what are the articles of
war, to which our General requires our fubmif
fion.âlt is the glorious charaCleriltic of truth,
at once to invite and bid defiance to investiga
tion. If any opinions which have sprung up
among us, have really led lis ailray from the
(tnndard of truth, let us return to it, ar the call
of Mr. Paine, or of any other man, who can
lliew us our errors. But fir, if upon examina
tion, even this teflament of orthodoxy, shall be
found to contain many fpurions texts, falle in
their principles and delusive in their inferences,
we in ay be permitted, notwithstanding our re
verence for the author, at lead to expunge the
apocryphal docftitne, and to confine our faith
to the genuine tenets of real political inspiration.
âIt is my intention to submit to the public a
few observations which have occurred to nie up
on the peruf.il of this pamphlet, which has so
clear and valid a title to the public attention.-â
But I must here observe, that I wish to avoid
every appearance of difrefpert, either to thÂ»
real parejit of this production, or to the gen
tleman who has flood its sponsor in this country.
Both tliefe gentlemen are entitled to the grati
tude of their countrymen ; the latter still re ']"
ders them important services, in a very digni
fied ftarion. He is a friend to free inquiry tip
on every fnbjedl, and he will not be displeased
to fee the sentiments which he has made his own,
by a public adoption, cauvafled with as much
freedom as is confident with the reverence due
to his character.
PU3LICOLAFROM THE CONNECTICUT COURANT
MefTrs. Hudson & Goodwin,
IT may not be improper to inform the public, that many of the
extra&s in the late papers refpe&ing Indian affairs, are m.ifre
prefentations. Capt. Armstrong who is reported to have been
attacked in coming up the Ohio, was, at the time fpecified, in
Philadelphia. Fort Pitt was not destroyed the 10th of May, al
though an express arrived at Philadelphia by the 20th of April
with the intelligence. The (lory of Mr. Stewart Wilkins has very
little foundation, and indeed very few of the reports circulated
have any, and such as have grounds are much exaggerated. Thai
the Indians are disposed 10 commit depredations and distress the
inhabitants of the frontiers, is beyond doubt; and that the dignity
of the Union requires a force to be f<*nt to protest and defend the
frontiers, and to teach the savages that the United States have power
as well as mercy, is equally plain; but that such frightful depre
dations are committing, is not trueâthe reports are calculated to
terrify, and circulated to prevent emigration to that country âthey
tend to impede the wifhesof government in giving protc&ion to
that part of the Union, and to discourage the yÂ®ung and enterpriz
ing from entering into the service of their country, and exploring
the most beautiful as well as fertile part of the United S atcs,
where not only a rational curiofjty will be gratifi d, but a know
ledge acquired which will richly compensate them in the future
prolpe&s of life.

IN order to promote the commerce of flour to

Some Account of STEPHEN BOETIUS.
STEPHEN BOETIUS lived in the reign of
Charles IX King of Franceâhe was one of
the King's Counsellors in the Court of the Pai lia
ment of Bourdeaux, and the cotemporary and
friend of Montague. 15ei ween ! hefe two characters
i'uch an intimacy and confidence fubfifled, that, as
Montague himfelf fays, " There are but few such
to be read of; âand further, there never was a
better citizen, more affectionate to the quiet of
his country, nor more an enemy to the troubles
and seditions of his time.
His discourse concerning voluntary servitude
was publiflied fooii after the mafl'acre of Paris,
and the (laughter of the Pioteftams throughout
inoft of the provinces of France, although wrote
several years before. If any thing could have
whetted the author's llile with keener darts
again ft tyranny, to what a heigh :h of indigna
tion would that deferable and execrable scene
have raised the virtuous spirit of this yonii<r
man ? But as the fame causes must ever produce
the fame effects, he knew the nature of tyranny
to be such. that there is nothing so monstrous
and wicked hut what ic is capable of perpetrat
ing; and perhaps might not have been surprised
at so prodigious an event, but might have looked
npon it as a very natural confluence from those
principles npon whit h tyranny is founded.â

Accounts from Genoa, of Feb. 18, mention the
appointment of Mr. Ravara, as Consul to the

In the National Assembly of France, nothing
has occurred more deserving ot notice than a
letter from the friends of the conflitution at
Marseilles, dated the 15th of March.
To the number of 2000 they offer them Helves
:o march to the frontiers, and by their valour
repel the invaders of the Liberties of Franceâ
Not unappofitely they allude to the following
anecdote
" The Phocians, our ancestors, fay ihey, in
landing upon these cas a bar of iron into
the water, swearing never to returntodefpotifm
and their couutry, until that bar fliould swim
out. It is still in ourGulph, and WE again swear
never to return to slavery, until it floats upon the

PROVIDENCE, June 9.
At the annual town-meeting held here on
Monday last, a petition was presented, praying
rhat a fufficient number of Schoolmasters be ap
pointed to inftruft all the children in town, and
rhat their salaries be paid out of the town-trea
sury. The petition was read, and the consi
deration thereof referred to the adjournment on
Monday nextâand the school committee were
requested to report at that meeting, rules and
regulations for the government of'fuch schools,
&c. From the alnioft unanimous approbation this
important measure received from all quarters,
we anticipate, with the greatefl pleasure and fa

veafonably expected to result from an eflablifh
;nent which, will do honor to the townâbe of
infinite service to the rising generation, andmuft

We cannot close this article without faying, what

have inrerefted themselves warmly in its favor.

MIDDLETO VVN, June n.
Yesterday morning arrived in this city, the
Hon. Mr. Jefferfon, Secretary of State, and the
Hon. Mr. Madison, Reprefenrative in Congress
from the State of Virginia. We are told they
are from Lake George, &c. on their route to the
southward.
We are informed that the Directors of the
Bank of Maryland have, since the receipt of their
Second Payment, commenced discounting at For
ty-five days fight.âlt is with pleafute we remark
that this Bank, although in its infancy, seems to
p defs the fulleft confidence of the public.â Its
paper is received here in preference to specie,
and is rapidly gaining the countenance and pro
tection of the trading people to the Southward
and Westward. We also learn, that it is re
ceived in the Bank of Non h-America as specie,
and that the Secretary of the Treafnry of the
United States, has directed the Collectors of the
Revenue to receive its paper in all payments, to
exchange specie for it, and to make the Bank of
Maryland the place of deposit for all the public
monies collected in this state.
The plan on which the Bank of Maryland is
formed, and founded, hath met with the appro
bation of some of the firft Statesmen and Mer
chants in Europe and America ; and while it re
flets high credit on its public-spirited founders
and liberal patrons, it mud afford great fatisfac

fee it thus early in pofTeffion of the confidence of
so sagacious a Minister as the Secretary of our

The Pittsburgh paper of June 4, ftysâ"Wei
hear from the town of Wafluiigton, that a man'
arrived there on Monday lalt, and brought the
following intelligence, viz. That some (pies who
were out from a Itation on Short Creek, had ccine
in and informed that they had discovered some
Indiansâimmediately a party of 27 men, under
the command of Lieut. Bulkirk, crolied the river,
and soon came upon the trail, and Lieut, Buf
kirk, with three of his men, being a little ad
vanced before the relt, were fired on, by which
Lieut. Buikirk was killed, and the three men
wounded. The Indians immediately run, and
were fired 011 by the refl of the men, who pur
sued them about two miles. It is supposed some
of the Indians were wounded, as blood was dis
covered where they were fired upon. This par
ty con filled of 14, and this affair happened on
Sunday afternoon lad." .v
The foregoing is all the account of Indian de
predations brought by rhe mail from Piitfburgh
this weekâwe doubt not that many recent ac-
counts, I
wii 1 turn out to be either*
premature or greatly exaggerated. A very for
midable force is now on the march to protest
the frontiers, and bring the Savages to reason,!
or punifbment.
The present war in India will probably be fcru*
tinizedâthis is said in a lace London paperâbut
threats, of various complexions, for several years'
past, which appear to strike at the Miniller, have
only to fix him more flrongly as Premier.
Â£Is it an argument in favor or against a piiblil
cation that the author should be prosecuted ? *
Something has been said about a prosecu
tion of the author of" the pamphlet emitWci
" Rights of Man." Should that take place, if
the principles of the author are right and jult â
except all sense of freedom is extirid: in the Eng
lilh nationâa jury will never be found who will
convidt the writer ; and if the principles (hould
receive fnch a fan<ftion,it will not be long before
the people of England would adopt the language
of Mr. Paine, and fay, that " German Eletftors
make German Kings"âand then in the words of,
scripture. fay, "To your tent*, O Israel " A
The ifiue of a prosecution, (hould one tnkel
place, would be an index to the public opinion]
of that pamphlet in England. J
All that is (did in 40 of the latefl English newspapers, down to
17th of April, refpe&ing a prosecution of the author of the
" Rights ot Man," is contained in the following aiticle:
If the Attorney General should find it necelTary to make in
quiry of Mr. Paine refpetting his laie publication, it is not im
orobable but that the Secretaiy of the Conllitutional Sociery? Â»r> a y
be involved in the legal converzatiane. Columb. Centinel.
So imprefled is the Whig Club of Ireland with
the importance of dilleininating the principles
contained in Mr. Paine's pamphlet, through iliac
kingdom, that they have taken meafuresto have
ir printed and fold at the lowest rate, and alfb
detailed in their newspapers. This at least does
honor to their liberality, as Burke has always
heretofore been in high repute with his country-

The bridges are to be conftru&ed on the principlesof those erefl
ed over Charles, Myftick, and JJtvrrly Rivera in the Statq of Mas
sachusetts, with a draw to admit a free passage for vefieU with fix
ed standing mads, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as shall be determined most con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks on
ach fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficieni
to aid vessels in pafljng through. Also, one lamp on each fide, of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during
tfee rontinuance of the lease.

The bridges aie to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as shall render them perfc&ly substantial and secure in
the opinion of the commissioners, and are to be of a futficicnt
height to proteÂ£fc them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from sto 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for carnage way, 20 feet.
Do. far foot walks, nilcd off on ejch fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet.
Do. for balluflrades, 1 foot each, 2 feet.
Do. for hand-tails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, g* feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluftrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Boston and Charleltown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept in constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be surrendered in good order,
agreeably to the adt.
The following are the term? which the comrpiflTiojiers are au
thorised to offer to contra&ors ;
A lease of the cxelufive privilege of the bridges for 0 period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equak to three-fourths of the pre
sent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an eflimate as cpuld polftHly be obtained, the
actual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last past,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will consequently produce an
immediate income of gpo pounds pttr arm. Thij may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can lie calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftru&ion of these bridges will give 10 travel
ling, the cafy communication thereby offered with the Hate of
New-York, on the weÃern fide of the Hadfon, are all important
circumstances, which must necessarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads conneftcd
with the budges, and have a lottery now on loot for that purpose.
As soon as the places lhall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the contrafls for erefling them are executed
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contract on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their trrms sealed
within three months from this date, to William Maxwell
I?' u n , ':XÂ°rk; Specifying the IWteft period ot lease for
which they will undertake to erect the said bridges, together with
proper fecurUy for performing the fame.
