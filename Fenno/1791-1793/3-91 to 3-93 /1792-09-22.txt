PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION,
An ELEGANT EDITION of the
SACRED SCRIPTURES
Of the OLD and NEW TESTAMENTS, with the
Apoc r y pha,
0n a very Urge and beanlijul vew Type, and/uperjtnf
to., j.â
Paper,
THE great importance of the JHoly Scriptures,
interesting to every individual; the divine excel
lence of its do&rines and precepts, and the beauty
and fublimitv of its paflages, have so long made it
a capital objedl of attention, as to preclude occa
sion or opportunity for eulog'iim.
The piety or enterprise of individuals has pre
sented this invaluable book to the public in a va
riety ot forms ; in some editions it has been highly
embellilhed with superb engravings, which have
greatly enhanced its price ; in others it has been
accompanied with voluminous commentaries,
which neceflarily encreafed the Cue; while a va
riety of plain cheap copies have generally diftuffd
the knowledge of the ScripuiÂ»e, and, made the
ourchafe easy to every class.
Without wishing in the smallest degree to lessen
ihÂ«_ nu-iita PÂ» whether pJaitt
or ornamented, which the public aie already in
polfcflion of, it is pertinent to remark, that very
many readers of taste and judgment have expreflcd
a wish tor a Family Bible unencumbered with ad
ditions. There Hill appears room ior another
edition on a beautiful new type, superior in fise
and elegance to any bible that has yet been printed
in the English language, and which, leaving the
adventitious circumstances of ornament or com
ment, may exhibit the Oraclcs oj God in their na
tive limplicity.
SPECIMEN OF THE TYPE.

for the work of the size of the above Specimen.
11. The work will be comprised in twenty
numbers, nuking two elegant volumes in Folio ;
to be lurnifhed to fubfetibers at one cfollar each

punctuality, no patt of the work will be delivered
unless paid tor.
111. The full number, containing sixty folio
pages, elegantly printed, will be furnifbed on the

(CONTIN'I ED.)
it FARMER" seems dtfpofed to alarm j
J. the hatters and tanneis with luggeftionsj
that their saw materials may be cugroiled Â«nd
made objifls offpeculation, but the third lec
tion Â»(' tiie New-Jei fey law forbids the company
to deal or trade in any raw materials but iuc 1
as are fit and necessary for the articles it manu
factures, ami such as shaH be really raid truly
obtained therefor. It is known that they have
determined upon thoie branches which :equiie
water spinning machinery (a cale peculiarly hap
py as there are not two hundred water ipmcles
in the United States) and the imports oi the
goods they propose to make are ten times as
great as their whole capital ltock, much oi
which they/vill invest in buildings, lots, imple
ments, machinery, working carriages and cat-
tie. It is plain that bark, lime, and hides for
the tanners could not be supplied to thefn from
any distance, and they could notengrofs either.
In refpeft to wool and our country iurs, the
fame remarks apply to them, an J it they were
tixpurchafe foreign furs they would no doubt do
it abroad : But they do not appear to have in
vie\V any thing but the spinning and cotton dy
ing and calico printing business, and are appro
priating their funds extensively to those branches.
44 The Farmer" declares the grants ot pri
vileges, even such as t.;ey aie, to be uncoiifti
tutional. Surely, then, there is no danger from
them, as fiey mult be void and of no e;fe&. It
he will examine the civil lift of New-Jer.ey, he
will find no reason to apprehend, from the gen-
tlemcn wba compose it, the enforcing of un-
constitutional laws.
The origin and design of the New-Jersey ma
nufacturing society has been frequently miiun-
dcrftood and misrepresented. In the year 179 1 >
several months after the government had been
transferred from New-York, the Secretary of
the Treasury formed the plan. It was repre-
fented, that one of the great objections to ma-
nufa&ures in the United States was the want
of money ; and although there was manifeftly a
greater abundance of a<stive capital in 179 1 than
for years before, yet thee was no profpeft ot
an early application of a sum equal to a moiety
of a capital of any one of the firft fifty manufac
turers and traders in Great-Britain, France,
Holland, Germany, or Flanders, by any indivi-
dual. An union of many individuals was the
only mode that could be adopted ; and as there
was supposed to be Tome rifque,it was certainly
a prudent method, as each would take care not
to subscribe so largely as to hurt hiinfelf, if* a
failure Hiould take place. Tiie subscribers, to
avoid rifquing more than their fnbfcriptions,
were, of course, to apply for an incorporation,
and it was not all probable the furn would
have been fubfcribedwithout one. The several
banks in Philadelphia, New-York, Boston, Bal-
timore, Providence, 6cc. had beÂ«m mado
the fame way, and the inland navigation com
panies and turnpike road companies in the Ca
rolinas, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New-
York, &c. have been composed in like manner.
Moreover, as it was manifeft, that active capi-
tal was flowing into and arising in the United
States very rapidly, there was a sincere and fe
jious apprehenlion that evils would arise from
it, particularly a profufe eoii!um,>tion, unless
objeCts to employ it were provided, and it ap
peared therefore a reasonable belief that the
want of capital, after One well-deviled and fuc
ce sful plan, would ceale to be among the ob
je&ions to manufactures. It isearneltly wilhed,
that the body of the /hip owners in the United
States may not furnilh an initance of an overap
plication of capital, in one of the old mode-,
which, as it is a talh business, must be accom
panied with an actual excels of money. The
recent banks, canals, and road-, de
monstrate, that without new objects,large sums
of money must have laid unemployed. With
the iinpreffions above stated the plan of the ma
nufacturing company was adopted, and it would
be happy for Pennsylvania If her "Farmer"
would promote the eftubiilhinent of such an im
ftitution on that great interior canal, the river
Sufquehannah, under the auspices of the State
Legislature. The yeomanry would find, that
the capital and industry of the manufacturing
citizens would be wifely directed to the spot,'
where their cattle, grain, wood, hemp, flax,
wool,Bc iron, would be demanded by confuraers,
without encountering the costly charge, and,
in some instances, the insupportable exjence,
of transportation to a sea-port. Several of
these institutions would give a front to Ameri
can manufactures which is ncceffary in their
competition with foreign commodities. But to
return to the New-Jersey manufactory : It ap
peared prudent to take a position in that State
for the purpose of interesting N;w-York and
Philadelphia, and as New-Jersey has verv little
foreign commerce, it was prefunied that both
her legislature and her citizens would promote
so valuable a branch of internal trade. The
latter have accordingly fubferibed handsomely,
and the State, knowing that thele new enter
prizes are attended with great expences at the
commencement, with risque, and sometimes
with tof-., authorised the company to rai r e by
lottery 103, odd dollars, as an indemnification.
Their real estate was exempted from State tax
es for ten years, and their stock, or personal
property, altogether. These taxes, however,
as before oblerved, will be very small under the
State laws, and they will be so remote, that the
manufacturers in other parts of the Union can
not be "eniible of their efieCts.
" The Farmer's" suggestion that the com
pany will be enabled, by the temporary advan
tage of a lottery, to undersell, is not even plau
libie ; for we know that merchants and manu
facturers d> not use their occasional advantages
for the absurd purpose of undeiTelling their
neighbours for a short time, but to encreafe
" their own fubi. aiicc and (lock : And it t'wy

delight in the most virulent abuse on a govern

America, to the honor, dignity and happmefs ot
the country. And all who affect too much!

PARIS, July 18.
Speech made the 14th of July, at

the column of liberty, on the ruins
of the Battile :
" On the ruins of the cavern of
despotism, the column of Liberty e

tyrants to dettroy our. labors, as it
was for citizens to overturn the
Baltile. It is due to the Representa

tionâwe fee atnopg thein i hree, who,
with us, dared 011 this ground, the
cannon of despotism : they swore with
us a mortal hatred to the enemies of
the people ; they ha.ie kept their
oath. Since tyranny ft iII dares to
raise its hideous head, let us swear
together to give it a death wound.
All Kings conspire to ruin the French
nation. Let us then swear to detkroy
the conspiring Kings. Jt is time to
reap the fruit of our work, and tofee

the funthine of law and equality."
Where the Ballile stood there was

ABSTRACT 0/ EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE.
T he French papers mention fre
quent desertions from the Autlrian
army.âThey fay further, that a great
mutiny hps broken out among the
soldiery of that army; and that it
requires one half to keep the otherj
in fubjeiftion. A report at Vienna
dates, that the Autlrian Minilter at
Constantinople had been arretted.â
A grant of the liberty of the press,
under very moderate retlri<ftions has
been made at Stockholm, the capital:
of Swedenâthe abettors of the King's
atlaUination it is thought will be par
doned. The States of Holland have
determined not to take, openly, an
acftivepart in thedifpuies with France
âbut the withes of the Stadtholderian
party are in favor of the Pruliian
arms.âThe Dutch patriots are much
caressed by the Prince of late, being
appointed by him to places of emolu
ment. A camp is now formed at
Soitlons in France. The manifeftoof
the Duke of Brunfwick does not ap
pear to have produced the etFeifl wifli
ed for by every friend to the liber
ties of France, a cordial union among
all parties for the common defence
of the country âon the contrary it ap
pears that they are as eager in revil
ing and calumniating each other, as
if they had no common enemy âIt is
however expetfled that order will arise
out of confution ; one account fays
that the Jacobin club can reckon only
45 or 46 members of the National
Aflembiy on whom they can depend.
A confirmed majority on either tide
will prpbably produce a concert of
measures, which appears at present to
be much wanted.
The King of Prussia has published
a long manifelto, Hating the reasons
which have induced hiin to take up
arn>3 against Franceâthese reasons
are fubflatitially the fame with those
contained in the manifelto ot the
Duke of Brunfwickâit is however
couched in more elegant and explicit
terms, than the latter ; or else that
of the Duke has not had jiillice done
it in the tranilation.âTheanniverfa
ry of ihe French Revolution has been
celebrated with great eclat in Ire
land and Scotland âamong thenume
rous patriotic toasts given 011 this oc
caftpn, the name of Washington,
the father of his country and the

A vefTel from arrived here,

were arming in all their pons.
It has been proposed in the Jacobin Club, that
a Diclaturate of 21, should fupercede both King
and Aliembly,chufe nunifters, appoint generals,
and conduct tne war..
It is determined, that the slates of Holland

The King notified the Afleuibjy that the
Elector of Cologne, and the Duke of Wirtern
berg, were preparing hostilities against France.
âThe important queition respeCting the DE
POSING of the KING, was to be agitated on
the 9th of August.
The fourth anniversary of French Freedom
was celebrated at Paris with great solemnity
and magnificence, and without any unfortunate
accident happening throughout the day. The
procelLon to the Champ de Confederation was
very regular and extremely grand. The King
arrived on the ground about noon. He was at
tended by the Ex-Miniiters and a large body of
National Guards, and was received with accla-
I mations the people. The following oath
was then read aloud, the King, the National
All'embly, the Deputies of the Departments,
and all the Minilters, Officers, &c. {landing un
covered, with their hands raised to Heaven :
â¢* we swear to be faithful to the Nation, the
Law, and the Kingâto maintain with all our
power the Conllitution decreed by the National
Affemnly and accepted by the King; to protect
the individual and preserve his property accord
ing to i.iv, : m let that there be a free circula
tion of grain throughout the kingdom; to en
force, with all our power, the collection of the
public revenues, and to remain united to every
Frenchman by the bands of brotherly love."

The King, the Legislature, and the people,
then pronounced aloud, u I swear it." The
acclamations which followed were long and re
iterated.
The Ruffians, in consequence of the warm re
ception they met with from the Poles atZallaw,
on the 17th June, have made no further progress
into the kingdom on that quarter. Had l'ome
of.the Polish general officers done their duty ef
fe<stuaily, the advantages over the Ruliiwis
would lsave been greater. The King has there
fore ordered, that Prince Michael Lubomirlki,
and General Czariki, who each commanded a
brigade, lhould be tried by a court martial.
From the motions of the Ruffians, Warsaw,
the capital of Poland, seems to be their object.
The lÂ£ing therefore, in consequence of the dan
ger which threatens that place, instead of join
ing as was his intention, the army of the Prince
Poniitowlki, his nephew, in Yolhynia, is now
anxious only for that in Lithuania. He has in
cohfequence ovdeied a csnip to be formed be-
Vistula, near Warlaw, to cover that
1 city.âThe English papers fay, the King of the
French has four chances to run ; he will either
be carried off by the Jacobins to Bourdeaux, by
' the Feuillants to Lyons, by Luckner orFayette
to either army, or by the HuJans to the German
dominions,âUnder the fiifl stone of the Pillar
of Liberty to be erected 011 the ruins of the Baf
tile, a box was 1 placed containing the declara
tion of the Rights of Manâthe King's picture,
and that of the lirft President of the constituent
uremblyâand of the members of the conftitut
|ed powers, some bell-metal money, and some
laffignats.âBy the latest accounts the Emperor
and Empress of Germany were arrived at
! Frankfort preparatory to the
I which was to take place the 14th July.
Acoounfs from India to the 22d March, fay,
that General Meadows had entirely -recovered
of his wounds.âLieutenant George Douglas, of
the 75th regiment in India, was calhiered for
killing Lieutenant James Burch in a duel.â
Twerity-tive Priests, the Englilh papers lay,
have been hung by the populace in France.
The Glafs-W'orks erected a few
yeais lince at Watervlier, well of Al
bany, in the state of New-Yoik, hav
ing been repaired,are now furnifhed
wiih materials for carrying 011 the

The ingenious John Churchman
lias failed from Baltimore for London.
Upon a late occasion it was found
that the Federal interest in the state
of Rhode-lfland, was in a ratio of 500
to one, compared with the Anti-Fede
ralâ One ps the federal candidates
for reprefentntive in Congress, of
that (late, having had fifteen hundred
votes where his competitor had but
thi'ee ! Mr. Bourn, the other candi-
a member ofthe present federal
house of representatives, it is said,
had no competitor whatever.
It is the custom in fonie of the
Southern States for the cariditates for
appointments publicly to folicic the
fuffrages of the elet'iors. A correl
pondent has observed with pleasure,
that in the inltances which have fal
len under his cognizance, there does
not appear to be a dereliction of any
principles on the part of the candi
dates, in thole addiefles, which are
eilential to the support of a free firm
efficient government ; or of thol'c
measures which Congress haveadopt
ed, in carrying the constitution of
the United States into effect.-"-This
is not only honorary to the judgment
of the candidates,but highly so to the
good fen re of the people.
Those w!io lay that an excise does
not dtmin'ijh the confuuiptioii of fpi
-1 ituous. liquors, may as well affirm
thai the lels money tlieic is to pur
chase, the greater the quantity that
will be bought. But i iie number of
Hills has encreafedâ this is owing to
various causes ; the number of peo
ple has encreafedâthe impoitation
and confequem consumption offoreign
Ipints has Icllenedâthe manufacture
of gin and other spirits in the coun
try, owing to the encouragement held
out in the excise law, is become an
objetft of great attentionâand there
is reason to luppofe, that in conl'e
quence of thi< encouragement, the qua
lity of the liquors diltilled in the
United States, will continually im
prove, till iu a fliort time the exports
of spirits, already considerable, will
become a source of immenl/: profit to
the country.
" It gives us great pleasure (fays a Boflon
paper) to tind that the patriotic Jcjfc'fon has
become the objedt of censure, as it will have a
happy tendency to open the eyes of the people,
to iee the itiides of certain men in power, who
are wiftiing to turn every ltaunch republican
out of office, who has discerning to ken their
arbitrary meafiires, and honesty fufficient to
reveal them."
From fevcral symptoms it appears that the
old republican spirit of America is returning in
full force upon thoje parts* of the United States
where it had been rather obfeured for some time
past by the arts of ariftocratical sophistry. How
the u Gazette of the United States" will be af
fected by this change, a short time will deter
mine. Some think the Printer will be served
much in the fame manner as the fox served his
and verminâhe is said to have funk him
felf gradually into a pool of water, with a
wisp of Itraw in his role, the vermin all the
while crawling up as the fox immersed his car
case, till at length Revnard gave them the
dodge, and left them to fhift for themselves !

Jn t'aec Sonnets âBy a Lady.
SONNET I.
DESPAI 11.
ADIEU those fancy'd visionary joys,
When fortune fmil'J, and every bliss was
mine;
Alas! how chang'd the scene ! The flatt'ring voice
Of friends, salutes no snore with founds divine,
And thou, sweet hope~-but cruel nymph adieu,
Who once delufn ehad my heart brtray'd ;
Those pleasing trails which happier fancy drew,
By thy neglect eras'd, capricious maid.
I trace the step that thou hadft trod before,
Those (hades where once wiih thee I us'd to
stray ;
But now, alas ! thy taper guides no more,
Nor leads as once my sorrow darken'd day.
A!) ! then I quit thy treacherous form, tho' fair,
And, fad alternative ! I meet Despair !
SONNET 11.
THE INVOCATION
VTO loveliest fugitive again I woo,
IN \nd welcome to my heart thy Toothing lay
Thy devious step its wonted path renew,
And chear the lonely wanderer in her way
Why leave me thus, in fruitlefs sighs to momn ?
Why let thv vot'rv thus late vigils keep ?
Why when I languifti wilt thou not return ?
Come, gentle Hope, nor leave me e'er to weep.
Rife, generous, like the matin fun ariseâ
Regard my bark, in distant ocean toft,
To the rough Corsair a resistless prizeâ
Be thou my pilot, or the vettet's loft.
With thee though angry clouds the skies deform,
We'll ride at anchor fafe from every ftorni.
SONNET in
PRAYER TO PATIENCE.
WHILE in the fable dress of grief arrav'd,
With heart-felt sighs, I ruin's trophv form
Yet keepâOh ! keep me, gentle, meek ey'd maid
Superior to the black impending storm,
Though mark'd alone for every woe severeââ¢
Almighty fate! thy fovcreign will he done ;
But teach me due fubmiflion while I heai,
Those ills I strive, but vainly strive to shun.
Divert the mind from every wild furpri/eâ
Let si ber and difpaflion'd reason reign,
Or Fancy, with her magic forms arise,
To moderate and calm the f< nfe of pain.
But chief, O Goddess ! be mv humble prayer,
1 he weight of future sorrows to prevent ;
Throw o'er those poignant pangs that bring de
* fpair,
That fav'rite dress, thy mantle of content.
