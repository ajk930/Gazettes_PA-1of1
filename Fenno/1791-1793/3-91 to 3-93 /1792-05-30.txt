per annum, free from charges, and redeemable at the
pleasure or the United Sta.tes.
Thus, do ve lee realized (lays a correspondent) much earlier
than was supposed, by a direct loan, in our own countiy, a re-,
du&ion of one per cent, in the rate of government interest ,;
and we fee also a striking illustration ot the utility ot the insti
tution from which the loan proceeded. This money has been
borrowed an anticipation of the extra duties laid during the
last feflion of Congiefs, for the purpose ot carrying into execu

In last Wednesday's Gazette, a new publication, entitled,
The Foresters, an American Tale/' was mentioned The
1 towing extract from the work will ihew toe author s
nner:â
ult remains only that I give you some account-ot Mr.
Lewis. The adventures in his family have been very
I formerly told vou tlrit he feed lawyers to plead the cauie ol
the fere Iters.* These subtile pra&itioners loon found that the
fame arguments which they were obliged toufe in favor ot the
forefters, would apply with equal propriety to the cale ot Mi-
Lewis's own family. He had long been a widower, and the
family was governed by a fuccelkon of kept miitreiles, who
minded only their pleasures and the enriching ot their own re
lations and dependants. The tenants were abuled, the iriu.n
fion haufe was dirty and out of repair, and though the rents
were paid into the hands of the steward, yet much opprelhoii
and embezzlement, and little economy, were the constant to
pics of complaint. . ,
iC After the alteration, produced by the afliftance of Lewis s
lawyers ?n the sorest, they began to think it was high time to
do something of the fame kind at hoftie. The only peaceable
remedy which they could imagine, was to persuade Mr. Lewis
to marrv a reputable woman, who would be agreeable to the
family. "After much argument he was at length brought to fee
the neceflity of the cafe; and to prevent a lawsuit, with which
they threatened him, he consented to take the wises which tney
recommended. She is a lady of good sense and polite manners,
and treats him with the greatest deference and propriety. She
has had the mansion thoroughly repaired, the floors and win
dows cleaned, and the walls v/hitewafhed, and is not afiaid to
let hec inmost apartments be visited by the lun and air. lic
building is now commodious, wholesome, and pleasant, and tne
dirty dog kennel,t which llcod near the door, is demolnhed.
" It is fufpefted by foine that Lewis still has a hankering
after his old connexions, but he profeffes love tohis new wile
in the strongest terms imaginable. His caft-otl mistress has
had the audacitv to inult the newly married lady, and tell hei
that (he has no'bufinefs to occupy her apartments; th atall
Mr. Lewis's profefllons are insincere, and that flu lull polleile;
his heart. If these ladies should go to pulling caps, Mr. Lewis
will be in a critical situation, as indeed every man is when
two women are contending for him. It is said that iome o
the neighbouring gentlemen, who prefer concubinage to matri
mony, have taken the part of the late mistress, and iniift on
her restoration to bed and board ; but how this matter will
terminate can be decided only by futurity.
" He has also been very unfortunate in some of his diltant
plantations and factories. His black cattle liave caught the
horn difteinper ; some of his farm houses have been burnt, and
it is thought that several years will intervene before his affairs
will he set to rights.

Price One Quarter of a Dollar.
THE ACTS Qf this feflion, agreeably to the plan of this edi
tion of the laws of the United States, will be considered as the
first part of the second volume; so that the a6ts of each
Congress (the duration of which is limited by the conlluution to
the term of two years) will bs compiifed in Â«ne volume.
To the aÂ£ts of this feflion vill i>e annexed the ratifications of
the amendments to the Confttutiori ; the confederation between
the United States and the Delaware nation of Indians ; the tieaty
between the United States and the Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa,

: These, will those in the firld volume of the laws
are all the existing treaties.
A copious index will accompany the second volumeâwhen
completed, at the end of the next (eflion ot Congrcfs.
u As it is desirable that copies of the laws should be so multi
plied throughout the States, and in such cheap forms, as that every*
citizen of the United States ruay be able to procure them," it has
been thought advifeable, in this addition, 10 omit the fignature9
of the President of the United States, the Prelident of the Senate,
and the Speaker of the Houf; of Representatives. Their signa
tures would have increased tile lize of the volume, and consequent
