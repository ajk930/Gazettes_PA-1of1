PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING PY SUBSCRIPT IO
An ELEGANT EDITION of the
SACRED SCRIPTURES
Of ihe OLD and NEW TESTAMENTS, with ihc
Apocry phA,
On a very large and beantiful new Type, and [uperÃnt
Paba
THE great importance of the Holy Scriptures,
interfiling to every individual ; the divine excel
lence of its dottrinesand precepts, and the beauty
and fublimitv of its pafTages, have so long made it
a capital object of attention, as to preclude occa
sion or opportunity for eulogiurn.
The piety or enterprize of individuals has pre
sented this invaluable book to the public in a va
riety of forms ; in fotne editions it has been highly
cmbellifned with superb engravings, which have
greatly enhanced its price ; in others it hgs been
accompanied with voluminous commentaries,
which necefTarily encreafed the size; while a va
riety of plain cheap copies have generally diffufed
the knowledge of the Scripture, and made the
purchase easy to every class.
Without wishing in the fmallcft degree to leflen
the merits of the various editions, whether plain
6r ornamented, which the public aie already in
pofleflion of, it is pertinent to remark, that very
many readers of taste and judgment have exprefled
a wish for a Family Bible unencumbered with ad
ditions. There still appears room for another
edition on a beautiful new type, superior in size
and elegance to any bible that has yet been printed
in the Englilh language, and which, leaving the
adventitious circumftarices ot 01 nament or com
ment, may exhibit thc Oracles oj Cod in their na
tive limplicity.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES
MUCH declamation has been indulged against
certain charters, who are charged with
advocating the pernicious doctrine that u pub
lic debt} are public blcjfings," and with being friends
to a perpetuation of the public debt of tlie coun
try. Ampng these characters, if the Secretary
of the Treasury has not been named, he has
been pretty plainly alluded to. It is proper to
examine what foundation there is for those
charges.
Tiiat pfficer, it is very qertain explicitly
maintained, that the funding of the existing
debt of the United States would render it a
national blessing.âAnd a man has only to tra
vel through the United States, with his eves
open, and to oblervc the ii; v igoratlon of indus
try in Â©very branch, to be co iv'nced, that the
portion was well founded., â wlether right
or wrotK, it is quite a d.ierent thing from
maintaining, as a general proposition, that a
public debt is a public blefTji â¢ â .and
temporary ci 'uinft mces might render that ad
van u.;>e,nn, at one time, which at another
might be urtfuL
It is known, that prior to the revolution, a
great part of tie circulation of the country was
carried on by paper money ; that in confe
quencc of the events of the revolution, that re
fonrce was, in a great measure, destroyed, by
being discredited, and that the fame events had
d-ftroyed a large proportion of the monjed and
mercantile capital of the country, and of per
sonal property generally. It was natural to
think, that the chasm created by these circum
ltauces requiied to be supplied ; and a just the-
Saturday, September 15. 1792.
orv was fuffiqent to demonstrate, that a funded
debt would ar.twer the end.
To infer, that it would have such an efFect
was no more to maintain the general doctrine of
44 public debts being public benefitsthan the fay
ing, that paper emiifions, by the authority of
government, were ufeful in the early periods of
the country, was the maintaining, that they
would be ufeful in all the future stages of its
progress.
But to put the matter out of all doubt, and
to fliew how deÂ£titute of caftdor the insinuations
against the Secretary of the Treasury, on this
head, have been, I have extracted, and ilia.ll
insert here some paffaees from three of his re
ports to the Ho life of Representatives; by which
it will be seen, that his conduct as well as his;
language have been in uniform opposition to
the dodtrine charged upon him. The length
of these reports, it is probable have prevented
many well disposed persons from being acquaint
ed with their contents ; the prelum ption of
which emboldens the calumniators of public
chara&ers and measures to make airertions, of
the faliehood of which, the mere perusal of of-:
ficial documents would convict them.
Extract from a report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on the fubjeft of a provision for the
public debt, presented the 14th of Jan. 1790.
ii Persuaded as the Secretary is y that the proper
funding of the present debt, will render it a national
bleffng ; yet he is so far from acceding to the portion,
in the latitude in which it is sometimes laid down, that
â¢' public debts are public benefits," a position inviting
to prodigality, and liable*to a dangerous abuse, â
that he ardently wishes to fee it incorporated, as a
fundamental maxim, in the lyilein of public crcdit
of the United States, that the creation of debt (houid
always be accompanied with the means of extin
guishment. This he regatds as the true ferret for
rendering public ciedit immortal.âAnd he pre-
Jnm.es that it ts difficult to conceive actuation, in which
there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At leafl
he feels an unfeigned solicitude, that this may be at
tempted by the United States, and that they may com
mence their meaj'ures for the eflablipiment of credit,
with the observance of it."
Extract fiorn a leport of the Secretary of the Trea
sury on Manufa6lures, presented the sth of De
cember, 1791.
After using several arguments to illustrate the
operation of a funded debt as capita!, the Secretary
concludcs thus : " There are refpedable indivi
duals ', who,front a just aversion to an accumulation
of public debt, are unwilling to concede to it any kind of
utility. wKo can djcern no good to alleviate the ill with
which they Juppofe it pregnant ; who cannot be pcrfua
ded y that it ought in any fenje to be viewed as an en
creafe of capital, lejl it jhou/d be inferred, that the more
debt the more capita!, the greater the burthens the great
er theblrffings of the community).
44 But it inter efts the public councils to eflimate eve
ry objetl as it truly is, to appreciate how Jar the good
in any measure is compenjated by the ill, or tile ill by
I the good, either of them is f Idom unmixed.
'* A'either will it folow, that an accumulation
of debt is desirable, because a certain degree of it
operates as capital. There may be a plethora in the
political, as in the natural body ; there may be a Hate
of tilings in which any such artificial capital is un
neceflary. The debt too may befwelled to such a size,
as that the greatejl part oj it may cease to be ufejul as
a capital, Jerving only to pamper the dissipation oj idle
and uijjolute individuals ; as that the Ju/ns required to
pay the interejl upon ii may become oppreJJive y and be
yond the means which a government can employ, con
fidently with its tranquility to raise them ; as that the
rejources oj taxation, to face the debt, may have been
Jlrained too far to admit oj extensions adequate to ex
igencies , which regard the public fafety.
44 IV here this critical point is, cannot be pronounced;
but it is impossible to believe, that there is not such a
point.
" Andas the viefffiiudei of nations beget a perpetual
tendency to the accumulation oj debt, there ought to be
in every government a perpetual, anxious and un
ceafingettoit to reduce that, which at any time
exiits, as fact as (hall be pra&icable, confidently
with integrity and good faith."
Extra# from a report of the Secretary of the Trea
sury, relat ve to additional lupplies for carrying
on the Indian War, presented the i6ch of March.

" Ihe result of mature refleflion is, in the mind of
the Secretary, a jiiong conviction, that the lafl of the
three expedients, which have been mentioned [that was
the raising ot the sum required by taxis] is to be
preferred to cither of the other two.
" Nothing can moie ivttreft the national credit and
profperit)â , than a conflant and fflematic attention to
buibaml 4i.1l ihe means previously polTeflVd tor ex
tinguishing the prclVntdcbt, andio avoid, as much
as pofliblr, the incurring of any new debt.
" Necefjity alone therejorc can jufify the application
of'any of the public property, other than the annual re
venues, to the current fetvice, or the temporary and
casual exigencies oj the country- or the contracting of
an additional debt, by loans, to provide for those exi-
gencies.
" Great emergencies indeed might exifi\ in which
loans "would be indjpenfable. But the occasions which
will jujlijy them mvft be truly of that description.
44 Ihe prejent is not offucha nature ; the sum to he
provided is net oj magnitude enough to furnifk the plea
of nccf/ity.
" faxes are never welcome to a. community ; they
seldom fail to excite tineafy fenfitiom more or less ex
tenfive âHence a too frovg propensity, in the govern
ment of nations, to anticipate and mortgage therefour
ccs oj poferity, rather t/.an encounter the inconvenien
ces of a prejent increase of taxes.
121
" But this policy, when not di&atcd by *ery
peculiar circumstances, is of the worit kindâits
obvious tendency is, by enhancing the permanent bur
thens of the people, to produce Ufiing dijlrefs, arid ?ts
natural ijjue is in national bankruptcy.
4k Ji will be happy, if the councils of this coun
try, fanftioned by the voice of an enlightened
community, ihall be able to purlue a diticrent
COU' fe."
liere is example added to precept âin pur
suit of a doctrine, the oppolite of that which
is charged upon himâthe Secretary did not
scruple to hazard the popularity of his adminis
tration with a class of citizens, who, as a class,
have been among the firmed: friends of the go
vernment, and the warmest approvers of the
measures, which have restored public credit.
âThe circumstance indeed has been a weapon
dexterously wielded against him by his enemies,
who in consequence of the increase of duties
proposed have represented him as the oppreflor
of trade. A certain description of men are for
getting out of debt; yet are against all taxes
for railing money to pay it off. They are a
mongst the foremoft for carrying on war, and
yet will have neither leans nor taxes.âThey
are alike opposed to what creates debt, and to
what avoids it.
In the iirft cafe, their meaning is not difficult
to be divinedâin the last it would puzzle any
man not dndued with the gift of second light
to find it outâunless it be to quarrel with and
ptitl down every man who will not content to
walk in their leading firings ; or to throw all
thiugs into confufion. FACT.

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
June 18
The President announced thefollow
ingLetter from M. La ; Kayette to
the National Aflfemblyi
Entrenched Camp of Maubeuge, Juttc
16, 1792, 4th Year of Liberty.
" Gentlemen,
" A T the moment, too long delay
-fx. Ed perhaps, at which 1 am go
ing to call your attention to great
public interests, and point out among
our dangers the conducft of a minis
try which my correspondence has long
since accused, I am informed that un
masked by its divisions, it has funk
under its own intrigues; for, un
doubtedly, it is not by facrificing three
colleagues, from their own infignifi
cance the mere creatures of his power,
that the leafl excufeable, the most
noted of these minilters, will have
cemented in the King's council his
equivocal and scandalous exifience.
" It is not enough, however, that
this branch of the government should
be delivered from a baneful influence.
1 lie public weal is in danger : the fate
of France depends chiefly on her re
presentatives ; of them the nation
expetfts her salvation. Bur, when she
gave herfelf a conllitution, she pre
Icribed to them the only course by
which they call save her.
" Persuaded, gentlemen, that the
Rights of Man are the law of every
constituting allembly, a constitution
once formed becomes the law of the
legislators appointed under it, it is to
yourfeives that 1 am bound to de
nounce the too powerful efforts now
making to carry you beyond the rule
which you have protnifed to follow.
"Nothing Ilia 1 1 hinder me from
exercising this right of a freeman,
from fulfilling this duty of a citizen ;
neither their momentary errors of
opinion ; for what are opinions when
they deviate from principles ? nor my
refpedt for the represent atives of the
people; for 1 reipetft Hill more the
people themselves, of whom the con
flitution is the will fnpreme ; nor the
favor you have conltantly fliewn to
me; for that 1 wish to prelerve as I
obtained ir, by an inflexible love of
liberty.
" y-unr circumstances are difficult ;
France isnienaced from without, and
agitated-within. While foreign courts
snnonnci the intolerable proje<ft of
attacking our national fpvereignty,
and thus declare thenifelves- the ene
niies of France, internal foes, intoxi
cated with fanaticifiu and prule, en
[Whole No. 555.}
tertain chimerical hopes, and fatigue
us still more with their nifoit'nt ii>a
lignity.
" VOll ought, gentlemen, to fup
pret's tliein, and you cannot have the
power to do so, without being yotir
ft'lves confticutional and juit.
" You defii e to be so without doubt,
but cart your eyes 011 what partes in
your own body, and all around you.
" Can you dillemble that a faction,
and, to avoid vague denominations,
that the Jacobine faction has occa
sioned ail the difoiders. It is thac
faction to which 1 loudly impute them.
Organized like a separate empire in
its metropolis and its affiliations,
blindly directed by certain ambitious
chiefs, this forms a diHinct corpora
yon in the mid (I of the French peo
ple, whose power it ul'tirps by subju
gating their reprefentati and their
mandatories.
" It is there that, in public He
tings, love of ihe laws is denominated
ariflocracy, and their infraction pa
triotism. There the aflaflins of De
filles receive triumphsâthe crimes of
Jourdan find panegyristsâthere slfo
the recital of the allaflination ihac
stained the city of Metz, excited in
ternal acclamations of y>y.
" Can it be believed that they will
escape reproaches by flickering them
selves under an Aultrian manifello,
in which these fet'taries are named ?
Are they become sacred because Leo
pold has pronounced their name?
And because we have tofight with fo
reigners, who presume to meddle in
our quarrels, are we released from
the duty of delivering our country
from domeltic tyranny ?
" What import to this duty either
the project of foreigners, or their
connivance with counter 1 evolution
ills, or their influence on the luke
warm friends of liberty ? It is I who
denounce this left ; I who, without
speaking of my pad life, can answer
to tliofe who feign suspicions of me ;
" approach in this critical moment,
in which every man's character will
fool) be known, and let us fee which
of us, tnofl inflexible in his principles,
most firm in his refillance, will bell
brave the obltacles and the dangers
which traitors wish to hide from their
country, and which true citizens know
how to calculate and encounter for
her fake."
" And how (h6uld I longer delay
td fulfil this duly, when every, dajr
weakens the conilituted authorities,
and l'ubititutes the spirit of a party
for the will of the people ; when the
audacity of agitators imposes (Hencp
on peaceable citizens, and supplants
ufefol men ; when devotion ta a fe&
is made thÂ£ substitute of *11 public
and private virtues, what in 'a free
country ought to be the aufteve and
only rowans of arriving at the firlt
fundtions of government ?
" It is after'having opposed to all
obstacles and all snares the courage*
otfs and persevering patriotifin of an
army, facrificed perhaps to combini*-
tionfc againftits leader, that I can now
oppose to this faction, the correfpon
fpence of a miniflry, the worthy pro
duction of its clubâa correspondence
of whic,h all the calculations are falfe,
the promises vain, the information
fraudulent or frivolous, the councils
perfidious or contradictory ; where,
after having prelled me to advance
without precaution, and to attack
without means, tliey began to tell
me that refiftauce would soon be im
polfible, yrheu my indignation repel
led the dastardly aflertion.
" What l'Cmarkable conformity of
language, gentlemen, between those
[factious men who avow their aristo
cratic spirit, and those who usurp the
name of patriots. Both wish to sub
vert our laws, rejoice in disorders,
rife up'againft the authorities con
ferred by the people, detest the Na- 1tional Guard, preach indiscipline to
the army, and sow sometimes diltruft,
sometimes discouragement.
"As for me, gentlemen,who espous
ed the American cause, at the very
moment when its ambafladors declar
ed to me that it was loft* ; who thence
forward devoted myfelf to a pei fe
vering defence of liberty, and the f'o
vereignty of the people ; who, on the
nth of July, 1789, 011 presenting to
my country a declaration of rights,
dared to tell herâFor a nation to be
free, it ir fufficient that Jhe wills it; 1
come now, full of confidence in the
justice of our cause, of contempt for
the cowards who defer: it, and of in
dignation against the traitors who
would fully it ; 1 come to declare that
the French nation, if she is not the
inoft vile in the universe, may and
ought to refirt the conspiracy of kings
formed against her.
" It is not, undoubtedly, in the
midst of my brave army, that timid
fenliments are permitted ; patriotism,
energy, discipline, patience, mutual
confidence, all the civil and military
virtues I have found in it. In it the
principles of liberty and equality are
cherished, the laws respected, pro
perty sacred ; in it neither calumnies
nor factions are known ; and when 1
recollect that France has several mil
lions capable of becoming such sol
diers, I ask myfelf to what pitch of
debasement would an imtnenfe peo
ple be reduced (till stronger in their
natural resources than in the defences
of art, opposing to a monstrous con
federation the advantage of combi
nations directed to a single object, for
the base idea of facrificing their/fove
reignty, of covenanting for their li
berty, of fubniitting their declaration
of rights to negociation, to appear
one of the possibilities of the ifl'ue
that is rapidly advancing upon us.
" But in order that we, soldiers of
liberty, may fight with efficacy, or
die with profit to our cause, it is ne
cessary that the number of the de
fenders of our country be speedily
proportioned to that of their adver
saries ; that (tores of all forts be mul
tiplied, and facilitate all our motions :
that the comfort of the troops, their
equipage, -their pay, the provisions
for their health, be no longer exposed
to fatal delays, or pretended Pavings,
which always tnrn out the direct re
â verfe of their objedt.
_ " Above all, it is neceflary that the
citizens rallied around the confuta
tion be allured that the rights which
it guarantees will be refpecfted with
a religious fidelity, that shall drive
its enemies, concealed or public, to
despair. .
" Reje<fl not this wifli t it is that
of the sincere wish of the friends of
your legitimate authority. Afl'ured
that no unjust consequence can flow
from a pure principle, that no ty
rannical measures can serve a cause
which owes its force and its glory to
the sacred bails of liberty and equa
lity, wake criminal justice relume its
constitutional courle ; make civil e
qnality, and religious liberty, enjoy
the entire application of their true
principles.
" Let the royal power be untouch
ed, for it is guaranteed by the confli
tution ; let it be independent, for its
independence is one of the springs
of our liberty ; let the king be rever
ed, for he is inverted with the natio
nal majesty j let him have the power
of chufing a ministry that wears not
the chains of a faction ; and if there
be conspirators, let them peri/h by
the sword of the law.

Now appeared at the bar, amidst
the acclamations of the members and
the fpe&ators.
He demanded that the AfTembly
mould judge ngoroufly between him
and his persecutors. The depart
ment, conscious of its own unpopula
rity, aâd envious of the confidence
which the people reposed in the mu
nicipality, had always atuleavored to
mor ti f y the magistrates of the people.
It had continually opprefl'ed and u-
122
furped their powers, and had ever
been ambitious to be the creatures of
the Court, rather than the servants
of the Nation.
Hatred and vengeance were com
panions in every paragraph of tne
'late Arret : it was filled with calum
ny and untruth ; it has accused him
of negligence, and libelled the inha
bitants of the Fauxbonrg St.
as a set of men fufpeÂ«Sed of robbery !
Of what had this department to
complain ? Had a single person fall
en by the hands of ihe people What
did it lament ! That a martial law
had not been proclaimed ? That a
croud of citizens had not perilhed ?
That a civil war had not taken place ?
As to the confirmation of their sen
tence by the King, M. Petion said,
110 one need be altonifhed at it, for
the department had supported the ex
ecutive power, and the executive
power in its turn, now supported the

department tie I'Ardeche, from which it appear
ed, that M. duSaillant, and a Count de Combet,
were agents to the French Princes, and that
their bufmefs was to create infurre&ions in the
Southern Provinces. The Catholics were to
rife against the Protestants; the Royalists, who
are for the old monarchy, against the Patriots ;
and in (hort, the whole of the Southern Provinc
es was to become an immense burying ground.
The letters of the king's brothers, directed to
M. du Saillant, left no room to doubt the exis
tence of this conspiracy, which is now entirely
laid open. The generals and commanders are
named. Theirditferent tasks are allotted them,
and the routs they were to take delineated.
The Princes inform the confederates, that one
of them is immediately to set out for Spain,and
from thence to advance to take the command
of the army of the south, with a view to restore
the old monarchy,and alio the priests and nobles.
A decree was parted to fell all the episcopal

July 2t.
The order of the day called the attention of
the AfTembly to the discussion of the denuncia
tion,againft M. la Fayette.
M. Lacource, after a violent declamation a
gainst the condu<sV of that General, concluded
with demanding that he should be put in a state
of accusation.
His speech was demanded to be printed.
The Affeinbly upon deliberating, refufed to
comply with the requeil. A scene of noise and
tumult followed.
M. Tournay gave his opinion for the accusa
tion of M. la Fayette, whom he regarded as a
traitor, or at least a conspirator who wilhed to
domineer between the people and their enemies.
It was demanded that the discussion Ihould
be closed.
M. M. Fauchet, Baziere, and Chabot, oppos
ed the demand.
The debate became tumultuous; the spec
tators took part by applauding and and
by encouraging or reviling the speakers, as they
favored or disapproved of their opinions.
The tumult encreafed. The President com
plained that there was a (peculator, who hided
behind him, and demanded that he fhcruld be ar
rested. The tribunes instantly were all in con
lufion. The I'refident put 011 his hat, and or
der was (lowly reflored.
M. Briifot demanded the prorogation of the
discussion.
M. Fauchet demanded the adjournment till
M. I-uckner ihould have given an explanation
on what had been alledged, that M. la Fayette
had proposed to him to march their two armies
to Paris.
M. Gaudet read forne information to this
pyrpofe, which he had gathered in the conver
sion with M. Luckner, whom he affirmed to
have said, " I do not deny that it was proposed
to me in the name of la Fayette, by M. Bureau
de Puzy, who had been thrice President of th{
Conftitueut Aflemblv ; I replied to M. Bureau,
that M. la Fayette was master of his conduct
and might do as he ehofe, but that if he march
cd to Paris, I should march after him, and coun
teraft his designs by force ; M. Bureau replied,
But the life of the King is in danger."
M. Gaudet depolited the note containing this
information on the Bureau, and signed it.
The President announced, that some citizen"
alarmed for the fafetv of the Aflembly, demand
ed to be admitted, and likewise that a croud
were advancing to the Tluiilleries.
M. Petion appeared, and said, that he saw no
thing in the neighbourhood of the Assembly to
occasion alarm, and that those cit-en
wilhed to enter the Thuilleries, had' promln
to remain quietly at the gates
The adjournment was pronounced till t

\ M. Lacroit obferve'd, that the Affemblr
:not terminated their diftnffion of the acJati'n
which had yesterday been made against M
Fayette, and demanded that Messrs, Luckner
and La Fayette ftiould be bound to make posi

ROVIDENCE, Sept. 1
O Wednesday last the Bridge in the centre
of this town was finifhed. The completion of
w kof so much elegance and public utility
.v lought worthy of public notice, and was
ict ingly celebrated on the day following.
Tac artered military companies, under the
com nd of Cols. Tillinghaft and Whipple, pa
rades n the Bridge a little before noon. At
twelv'i o'clock fifteen cannon were discharged
upon t .e Br dge, which was adorned with an
tqu#lÂ» umber of flags, and several manual firings
"ere . lib performed. The military companies
then e .corted his Excellency the Governor, and
1 large number of reipeftable citizens, with
the inafter-bu lder and mechanics of the Bridge,
to I'cderal-Hill, where, having partaken of a
â¢ old collation, the discharge of cannon echoed!
tÂ» toasts :
lis Bridge is built on the model of that
which connects Boston and Charlelton. Though
much inferior to that in length, it is inferior to
none in ftrengthard beauty. It is 120 feet
long, having a draw 22 feet. It is 56 feet wide,
vith chinese fence at the Jides, and palifadqed 8
feet from each fide. It is lighted by 6 lamps,
which were confti u<sted by Major Burrill, of

NEWPORT, (R. I.) Sept. 3.
On Friday morning last, this town fultained
a very heavy loss by the death of Mr. Daniel
Rogers, in the 40th year of his age.
As a merchant and man of business, enter
prise, industry and pun&uality marked his con
duct ; in his temper and disposition he was hu
mane and benevolent, and in his manners affa
ble and polite; as a hulband, father, brother,
friend and mailer, few perhaps excelled him :
itfrfe virtues soon gained him general esteem,
and induced the freemen of the town, in April
last, to call him forth for one of their represen
tatives to the General Aflembly, and at their
lite choice to re-eJect him to fit in the
Goober session.
The anxiety and concern for his recovery,
apparent on every countenance, during a long
a-'d fe\ ere illness, demopftrated the fen'ibilitv
o nis fellow-citizens, and the part they (hared
ii his lufferings ; as did the great number of
si! ranks and denominations, paying the lafi
tibute to his memory, by their attendance at
hs funeral, on yesterday evening, a i-'cover how
fucerely they lament his untimely exit.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
TO ARISTIDES.
THOUGH thcie would be no great hazard of
mistake in inferring the writer of the paper
under the signature of Arijlides from " the appro
priate and prominent features" which chara&erife
theftyleof that paper; yet I forbear to imitate
the example which has been set, with too little de
corum, by naming or defciibing the supposed
author. The similitude of ilyle,or any other cir
cumstance merely probable, is too flight a founda
tion for so improper a procedure.
Peculiar circumltances which it is not neceflary '
10 explain, uniting with the conjrfture which is '
indulged refpecling the real Anjlidcs, lead to a
change of the original party to the charges. The
difculFion will be taken up and pursued hy one r
who is willing to be responsible for the allegations
he shall make, and who consequently will not re
fufe to be known,"on proper terms, to the officer
concerned. It is however not meant to invite en
quiry on that head. It is mod advisable that none
should be made. For any public purpose, none
will be vequifite. For any personal one, none
will be proper. What shall be said, will merely
to public conduit, and will be supported by
proof and argument.
Why then, it may he asked, the intimation of a
willingness to be known, if required ? The an.
Iwer is, merely to put an end to the epithets
" cowardlv afTaflin," 11 finking in the dark," and
other tropes and figures of a similar nature. Some
rhetoric rr.av be spoiled, but the elucidation of
truth will be promoted.
It occurs at once to an observant reader, that
Arijiides partes over in total silence, the leadiug ar
ticle of charge brought by the American against
Mr. Jefferfon ânamely, That be is the injlitutor
and patron of a certain Gazette ptlblifhed tn this
city, the object and tendency of which ate to vilify
and depreciate the government of the United
States, to misrepresent and traducethe administra
tion of it, except in the (ingle department of which
that gentleman is the head ; implicating in the
most virulent censure the majorities of both houses
of Congress, the heads both of the treaitriy and
war departments, and sparing not even the Chief
Magiflrate himfelf; that in the iupport ot this paper,
thus hostile to the government, in the administra
tion of which he holds so important a trull, he has
not scrupled to apply the money of that very go
vernment; departing by this conduct from the
rules of official piopriety and obligation, and from
the duty of a and patriotic citizen.
This is the leading and main charge which has
been brought by the American againll Mr.Jefferfon,
which he supports in several ways.
lft. By dirett proof of an official connexion
between the Secretary of State and the Editor of
the National Gazetteâcoeval with, or rather an
tecedent to the jirjl efidblijhment of that paper.
2d. Bv the fuggeftiori of his being opposed to
the present govei nment of the United Statrs, while
it was under the consideration of the people.
3d. By the suggestion ot his being opposed to
the principal mealures which have been adopted
in the courfc of its adminiflration, particularly
those relating to the finances.
! The objeÂ£t of the above recapitulation is to (hew
1 the true original ttate of the question; in order
that it may be clearly seen ho%v entirel) Arijiides,
in his defencc, loses fight of the principal point,
and contents himfelf with an indirect endeavor to
involve it in uncertainty, by disputing or denying
some positions which form only the collateral evi-
dencc.
It will now remain to fee how the charges of
the American have been and can be supported.
As to the connexion between the Secretary of
State and the Editor of the National Gazette, nei
-1 her of the following fa&s can or will be disputed.
I f any of them should be denied, it will be proved
beyond the pofiibility of doubt.
Ift. That the Editor of the National Gazette is
a Cletk in the department of State for foreign lan
guages, and as such, receives a salary of two hun
dred and fifty dollars a year.
2d. That he became so antecedent to the eflab
lifhment of his Gazette, having actually received
his fa! arv from the 17th August, 1791, and not
having publifhcd the fir ft number of his paper rÂ«ll
the 31ft of O&ober following.
3d. That at the time he became so, there was
another ch.ara&er, a Clerk in the fame depart
ment, who undcrftood the French language; and
that the Editor of the National Gazette is a trans
lator of that language only.
4th. That the appointment was not made under
any Ipecial provision, marking out a particular
Clerk (hip of the kind, its duties, or its emolu
ments ; but under a general authority to appoint
Clerks, and allow them salaries, not exceeding the
average of 500 dollars to each.
sth. That the Editor of the National Gazette,
immediately preceding the eftablilhment of thar
papei, was the fuperintendant or conductor of a
paper belonging to Childs & Swaine, printed at
New-York.
These are the facts : The conclusion is irrefifta
ble. The ferret intentions of men being in the
repofitorics of their owrt breasts, it rarely happens,
and is therefore not to be expe&ed, that direst and
pofiiive proof of them can be adduced.
Presumptive fa&sand circumstances must afford
the evidence ; and when these are fufificiently
strong they ought to decide.
We find the head of a department taking the
Ed itov of a Gazette into his employment,as a clerk,
w:ih a stated (aiaryânot for any special purpose,
which could not have been accompltfhed other
wile ; for he had, at the time, in his department,
a clctk Who was capable of performing the very
service required, and could without difficulty
have procured others fnnilarly qualified ; nor from
any particular neceflity arising from a too limited
allowance, or any other cause ; for he had it in
his power to allow an adequate compcnfation to
a character who might have been regularly attach
ed to the department.
The verv exiitence of such a connexion, then,
is alone a fufficient foundation for believing, that
thedefign of ihe arrangement was to secure an in
fluence over the paper, the Editor of which was so
employed. But the circumflances which attend
, t the nature of it beyond a doubt. That
which has beenjuft mentioned, namely,there hav
j ing been prcvioufly a clerk in the department qua
lified to render the service, is a weighty one. The
coming of a new pi inter, from another State to in
123
ftitute a Jiew paperâhis having bfcen appointed?
clerk in the department prior to his removal t
this cityâhis having been compenfaied before 1:
was even present, to latisly the appearance of ren
dering service ; these circumftanccs give a pon.
and energy to the language of the tranfadion whia
render if unequivocal.âThere perhaps never w.
a more flimfy covering for the pensioning of
printer. Some ostensible ground for giving him
the public money was necessary to be contrive.lâ
the cleikfhip of foreign languages was deemed,
plausible pretextâBut no man acquainted with I
human nature, or with the ordinary wiles O'
political intrigue, can be deceived by it.
The medium of negociation between the Secre
[ i-ary of State and Mr. Freneau, in order to the in
. dilution of his paper, is known, and documents
i are poflVflcd which ascertain the person ; but thev
arc. at piofent withheld, fÂ»om considerations of a
particular nature.âThese are the more readily
yielded to ; because the taÂ£ts, which have been
stated, render it unnecessary to exiiibit them.â
Those fa&s prove to the fatisfaefcion of every im
partial mind, that Mr. JefYerfon is the Institu
tor and Patron of the National Gazette.
As to the complexion and tendency of that Ga
zette, a reference to itfelf is fuflicient. No man
who loves the government, or is a friend to the
public tranquillity, but must reprobate it as an in
cendiary and pernicious publication, and condemn
the auspices under which it is supported.
In another paper, the charges which have occa
sioned so much umbrage to Ariflxd.cs, will be more
corre&ly stated and enforced. The preciie terms
|of the advice which was given by Mr. Jefferfon to
Congress, refpefting the transfer of the French
debt to a Company of Hollanders, will be recited.
This chara&eriftic trait in the political princi
ples of that gentleman, will be submitted to the
honest feelings not only of the great body of the
yeomanry, to whom such affe&ed appeals are so
often made,but to honest men of whatsoever clafsor
condition. CAT ITLUS.l T LUS.

ABSTRACT cf EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE,
Marshal Luckner was in Paris tlie 17th July
âthe public mind was greatly agitated in ac
counting for the motives of his heing there.â
T ie late apparent reconciliation of parties in
the National AlTembly turns out a temporary
oufinefs, as violent debates {till take place, and
tactions still diftraft the public councils.âM.
Luckner left Paris about the 20th Julyâhe in
much dilTatisfied with the decree which inter
dicts petitions from Generals of the armies.â
The decree, which declares the country to 1Â«
in danger, has been published with great cere
mony in all parts of the cityâand books were
opened in which great numbers of citizens en
rolled their names.â-The Ailenibly have de
creed that the army lhall be reinforced, jo as to
make it confjft of 452, qoo men.âM. Dufaillant
the rebel ariilocrat and several of his friends
and followers have been cut to pieces, the per*
Tons legally authorized not being able to prevent
their being maifacred; the forts of Banner Sc Jaies
are. reduced to afhes.âOll M. Dufaillant were
found papers which disclose an immense plot a
gainst the Conftituticn ; by far the most exten
sive of any attempted against it. M. Dufaillant
in these papers is named Generalifftmo of the
South, in which the counter-revolution was to
commenceâcopies of these papers were read
in the AlTembly, by which it appeared that M.
Dufaillant and a Count de Combet were agents
to the French Princes, that the Catholics were
to rife against the Protestants, the Royalists who
are for the old monarchy againlt the Patriots*
&:c.âThe Cure de Bannes was facrificed by
M. Dufaillant and his troops. âLong and loud
debates ensued on reading these papers, and it
was decreed that fifty-feven persons were guilty

Church-Wardens and Vestry-men. This lays the
Managers under the necessity oi further adjourning
the drawing of the Lottery, until the fifteenth day
of O&ober next, that they may have time to trans
mit these tickets to the parts of the state where they
aie applied for, and leceive the returns. As there
are but few tickets besides these remaining on

pious objett of this Lotteiy, or to take a chance
for the prizes therein, are rcquefted to (upply them

appointed to dispose of them, are defned to return
those to the Managers which then remain unfold,
to answer the applications of some gentlemen in
