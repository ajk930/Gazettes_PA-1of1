Mr. FeNKO,

Such an anticn: man while living, among
friends and old inhabitants of the country, is
conlidertd as a perfefl pjragon and prodigy of
his own sex. And wheo the invincible Death,
who comes to all, (Viall at length beset him,
there is more than anxiety with farviving tela

to endow it with freth laurelsâand place it fe.
cuie and sale, on the ilever-rufting files of gra
titude and fame!
The idea of detestation from fuccecding gene
rations, is dreadful in the extreme. And on the
othci hand, what is more amiable than to be
prailed and beloved, while their are men and
letters in the world. Next to the Godhead it
ielf, is the reputation and condition of a good
man âthe next in dignity, and next in vaiuc.â
He indted is deftrving of, and as surely obtains

CONGRESS.
HOUSE. OF REPKF.SENrATIVES.
Monday, January 28.
The Bill to authorize a Loan in the Notes
or Certificates of the fever a! States which,
on a final Settlement of Accounts Jhall have
a Balance due to them frout the United
Statesâhaving been read the third timeâ
the Shtejlion, (hall the Bill pass ? tuas
put by tie Speaker:
(continued.)
Mr. Madlfon remarked, that an amendment
now incorporated in the bill haÂ« changed its prin
ciple altogetherâit was contemplated by the o
riginal bill to provide for debts incurred only
for the support of the war; but by this amend
ment, debtsare to befubferibed to the loan which
were created subsequent to the period in which
those debts originated that have been hitherto
called debts of the United States.
Another amendment has been added, which
postpones the fubfeription to a period l'o diilast
as to anticipate the proper business of a subse
quent legislature, which will be more compe
tent to decide upon it than this house is
The gentleman who brought forward this
motion, afiigned as a reason, that by this poft
poneraent the Senate would have a controul over
the business, which they would not have with
out palling the bill, and with this amendment.
Mr. Madilon reprobated the idea of controuling
the deliberations of a subsequent legilUture. He
said the ground of the bill was changed. The
poftponenjent of the fubferiptions renders it en
tirely unnecessary for the present Congress to
decide upon it; âhe was in favour therefore of
postponing itâand of the previous question.
Mr. Gerry said he did not exped this opposition
to the bill, at this stage of the business; especially
from gentlemen who had advocated the very
principle on which thi bill is founded, viz. a
provifiou tor the balances which ihall be found
due on a final settlement of the accounts.
The motion for the previous rueftion is foun
ded on the remonstrance of the State of Virgi
rtaf âa state which justly has the reputation of
hieing wife in her councils and decisions; but on
the present occasion s single and alone in her con
duit in regard to this business. No other state
has come forward with fucha remonfiranceâa
remonstrance against the aÂ£t and doings of the
the branches of the national legislature. He
concluded therefore, that in this instance at least,
that state is inan error; especially as the grounds
of her complaints have been obviated. He then
adverted to the general provisions of the bill, and
Clewed that they were perfectly confonint to
the existing provisions made by former acts of
the government the balances which
(hall appear to be due to the several Hates. He
alluded next to the several provisos and amend
ments of the bill which had bee i ingraftsd in it,
to accommodate it to the wisheS oi those who,
notwithstanding, appeared to be as much oppos
ed to it as ever. He was really surprised and
confounded at the conduit of gentlemen in the
opposition. He notictd briefly i..e justice of the
claims of the creditors, and concluded by ob
fcrving, that there were already fuSkient diffi
culties to emburrafs the operations of this go
vernment; and he conceived that the oppofit.on
to meafurcs calculated to doing justice in this
particular cai'c, were calculated ta increase those
difficulties and embarrafi'ments.
Mr. Amen reprobated the idea of putting the
previous qucftion; after a difcuflion of three
weeks, it is now proposed to prevent a decision
of the fnbjeft; he con fide red this as a very un
fair and uhjuftifiable mode of procedureâsuch
Â»n one as the gentlemen in oppouticm to the bill
on more mature reflection would not themfelvei
juftify. He then noticed the scope of the argu
ments offered in support of the previous quefti
-011, and urged a variety of confederations to (hew
that the present was the moll lavourable time to
decide the question. He deprecated the coiife
qnences of a postponement, it would be e'onfi
dered as a denial of justice on the part of the
present legiilature, and as placing the creditors
in the mod uncertain lituation as to their luture
fate; in (hort he conceived it was such an evasi
on ot' justice i* might pst the country in a
Same.
Mr. Giles replied to Mr. Ames ; he coucciV
ed the consequence* would be dire&lv re
verse from thole he had anticipated; bethought
thole who v'ere to be benefited, who were com
paratively but a l'raall number, woukl not put
the country in a flame; the danger was that
those whe would faffer by the burthens which
would result fro.r. the meafure.wooldbe thrown
into a flame. He then entered into a general
conlideration of the fubjeii, and urged avariety
of reasons againf* the bill, and in favour of put
ting the previous question. Mr. Giles enlarged
on the impropi Hty of precipitating the business
the present ftilion.
f Mr. lÂ»age hadcaliedfor the reading of the pro
ceedings of the lcgiflature of the ltate of Virgi
nia relative to the funding fvllem, particularly
the aflYimption of die Hate debti. 1 hefe pro
ceeding! were accordingly read.
[Whole No. 596.]
Mr. White said he hadlkft feffomvottdaguinfr
the bill for affnminy the state debts, but he
should vote for the bril now under confidatatiottj
in this he thought! fie wm jrfrfr&lj canliflent,
that t ere was a radical difference between thte
two ; the former wis* proposition for afTumirg
all the debts of *11 the IlÂ»tei, the fame wh 1. it
had been orijrfoially propcrfed at New-York, and
which he had uniformly opposed. The present
is only for afluniing to the amount of the halaW
ces which may be due to creditor Hates; this he
always approved. He said he had heard but one
mrgument agninft the propriety of coming to an
immediate decision which appeared to have any
weightâthat was the unequal and imperfedt re
presentation j this, he said, was a circumstance
which he felt as fenlibly as any member of the
house, and if the proportion was to impose bur
dens oq the people, or to change an eltabliihcd
system.he Oiould hesitate before he agreed to its
but neither of those was the present cafe âno
additional funis were to be raised by the bill, and
no change ntade in the mode of payment of the
balances without the approbation ol the slates to
which (hey may be. due.
Having thus obviated this objection, he said,
he would give the reasons which induced him
to believe the matter ought now to be decided j
he observed, that perhaps it might have been
well had the bafinels not been brought forward,
con fide ring the oppofitioir which had taken place j
hedidnot,however,cenfure the gentleman who
introduced it, that gentleman had, as well a*
hinifelf, been acquainted with the proceeding#
refpe&ing the assumption fiom the commence*
meat. And he declared he did not expeit, when
the refolutiom were laid Â»n the table, that an
objection would be made to them; and it was
probable as little apprehenfiaa was entertained
by the mover ef the resolutions; but he thought
the manner in which the bill had been op
posed, asd in which it had been fuppor.ed re
quired an immediate deCilion. It had been
made the criterion of the public faith of the go
vernment , and of the lidelity ofitsofficers. Those
who were in iavour of the biil alledged as one
reason in fuppor: of it, that when the balances
were known, the dubtor Hates would not agree
to make provision for those balances agreeably
to the existing law. He believed that this fujÂ«
gellion was unfounded i he did not believe it was
pollible that any man, wlxom the confidence of
his fellow citizens ihould place on this fluor,
would everYefufe to carry that law into effect.
He conlidered it as one of the pillars of the con
flitutionâA folcmn compact; between the Unit
ed States and individual ftatcs; and he believed|
if ever this government (Hould be guilty of so
grofsa breach of farth in a matter of importance
fufficient toattraii thegeneral notice of theciti
iens, that there was an end to the government
itfelt:. It was a government foundedon opinion.
And when the opinion of the people tealed to
support it the government must fall. On the
other hand, the bill had not been opposed oil its
merits. No gentleman hadat.empted to point
out the individual or the difcriptioa of men wl.*
would be injured by die operation of the bill ;
they had opposed it wholly on collateral circum
stances; they had luppofed that if the ilates who
had debts due totheir citizens Ihould have their
balances discharged byaffuming those debts, that
they would oppoJc the payment of the balance*
to dates Â«4iicli have no creditors. It had like
wise been alledged, -hat thj Commiflionos for
fettling accounts might conduit themfelres iÂ«
such a manner as to render a legislative inter
position necessary to fcrrelt the mesfurei conse
quential of the settlement. He had 110 appre
hension of such conduit on the part of the Com
iniffioners, and could not legislate on a liippoii
tioh that they would eondud thcmfelve* in a
manner so very improper, but if they did, he
could not fee that the change in the payment of
the balances could have any effcit, if the legisla
ture could interfere where ftatcs were concerned,
they might do the fame in the cafe of individu
als; but at jealousies had taken place in the
minds of the members, and at both fides ol thf
house seemed to consider the palling thi> bill aÂ»
giving a greater foice and liability to the adt
for fettling the accounts betw en the U. Statet,
and individual ftatet, it was a strong reason with
him to gire his assent to it. It had been said the
palling the bill by so fhiall a majority would 0.-
cafion discontent and uneasiness among the peo
ple. This might be the cafe, but the lame rta
fon is equally applicable to a rejection of the bill
by a ftnall majority. Hut who are molt likely
to be diflktisfied ! Thole who by a rejection of
the bill would feel themlelves injured, at least
difapptinted in their expectations of advantage 1
or those Who, notwithstanding itt palfage, would
lie left in their present eondition i he believed
the former, so that at far as that argument had
any weight it was in favour of the bill.
Mr. Murray was in favor of the previousquef*
tionâhe tho't the present stage of the bufineC#
vfat the moll proper to call tor that question)
it would he f*i<i, have been justly exceptional
blc had the question been called previous to de
bate ; but now itwai ftriaiy proper) adverting
to the merit* of the bill; he objected to it at an
i.ifrÂ»aion of the funding fyUemâthat fyOem
provides for funding the balance! in favor of the
States, not the individual creiitoruâOn ti*principle he conftdered the bill a* eftablnWg R
dangerous precedent, and as affording a P rtt f xt
for future mfradions and mutilations of that
system. .
Mr. Murray adverting to certain observations
which had been thrown out refpeaing the: un
easiness which was said to exist in fnmc of the
states, informed the house, that with refpeft to
the flat* he had the honor to represent the
greatefl apparent Satisfaction with the measures
of the general government prevailed. It I* true,
said he,my conllituents feel the pressure of taxes
in common with the reft of their fellow citizens,
but they discover no disposition to complainâ
they consider the public burthens as the price ot
their liberties and independence; and undtr
this idea, submit to them with the utmost cheer
fulnefs, at the fame time confiding in the wildom
and justice of the government, that their im
positions will bÂ« regulated according to theex.
igencies of the nation, and that no unneceflary
taxes will ever be laid. '
He tho't it necessary to fay thus much, as he
conceived too high colouring had been given to
some representations which the fancy of mem
bers had brought forward in their zealous op
polition to the bill.
THURSDAY, FIB*ITAÂ»T 7.
A mefTage from the Senate, by Mr. Otis tlieir
Secretary, informed the House that they have

Mr. Mercer renewed the motion for limiting
the bill to four years from tho 3d day of March,
and moved the ayes and noes.
Mr. Mercer supported the motion by some re
marks on the impropriety of the present Con
gress anticipating the proper business of their
successors; on the dangerous precedent which
would be established by empowering the su
preme executive to continue hisfalary in oppo
sition to the opinion of the legislature. He con
sidered the bill without this clause as unconsti
tutional.

TRIAL OF THE KING.
NATIONAL CONVENTION.
December ix. . ..
The fitting commenced bv rending the Ast
of accusation ngainli Louis XVI. -which was
presented by Barbaroux, in the name of the
Commiflion of twenty-on?. It contained an
enumeration of the principal charges made
against the unfortunate Monarch ; and each
charge was followed by a lift of the pieces on
which the proofs are to be founded. When
it was read, several new charges were pro
pofM by several of the members, and Some
which appeared to have little weight, or to be
ill founded, were expunged.
The Convention wero much surprised tÂ»
hear Marat become i* some mealure the vo
luntary defeuder of Louis XVI. by requefhng
that all those charges alluding to crimes comÂ»
mitted before his acceptance of the Con dim*
tion, should be omited in the ast of accusa
tion. He spoke also of the aninefly which
followed that acceptance, but the Conventioi
paid no attention to his observations.
The Convention decreed that the ast of=(*â¢
Cufation should serve as the ground of those
questions which were to be put to Louis
XVI. and that after each question the Preii
dent should fay to him What have you tÂ»
answer ? The President was authorised alft
to propose such questions as might ariie from
the King's answers, and to make him fit dowÂ»
at the bar.
Barrere the President announced to tnÂ»
Convention that Louis XVI* wasat the door,
and requested the Representatives of tiie Peo
ple to afTume a dignity worthy of the gran
deur of their functions. He reminded them,
that they formed a tribunal 011 which the eyes
of Europe were fixed, and whole Sentence
would be judged by posterity. He forbade
them to shew any signs either of approbation
or disapprobation, and desired them to re
member that coolness and fi'ent dignity wi
which they received the King after his return
from Varennes. ,
At half past two Santerre informed tn=
Convention that Louis was arrived, and was
waiting the orders of the Assembly.
The President gave the order to mtrod 11c
him. The mod profound silence reigne
in the Hall. Louis appeared at the bar, a
tended by two Municipal Officers.

â pi'efident. " Louis ! the French nation
acÂ«ufes you.âThe National Aflembly decreed
the 3d of Decemberthat you (hould be tried by
them; and on the 6th, that you Ihould be
brought to the bar, to hear the accui'ation
readÂ°and to give your answers."
The Prefideut then read the articles of the
one by one, calling upon Louis tÂ« answer
tach of them separately.
Accusation. Louis, the French people ac
cuse yau of haying plotted and formed a mul
titude of coiifpiracies tto eftablifli tyranny in
destroying Liberty. On the 10th of June,
1789, you made an attack on the (bvereignty
of the nation, by fufpendiog their represen
tatives, and by expelling them with violence
from the of thfcir meetings.
Answer. There existed then no law.
Acc. On the 23d you surrounded the re
prefc-ntatives of the people with troops; you
presented a Declaration ordering them to
cease their meetings and separate.
The fame answer as to the preceding asti
cle. â 
Acc. You ordered an army to march a
gainst the citizens of Paris to shed their blood,
and you did not dismiss that army till the rs
volution had been effected.
Anf. I had at that time a right to order
troops to march according to mv will ; it ne
ver was my intention to cauic the effufion of
blood.
Acc. Yon fuffered the National Cockade
to be trampled under foot before vonr eves,
and the white cockade to be worn. You con
stantly rejected the conltitution.
An'f. As to the decrees, 1 made the obser
vations I then thought I ought to make ; as
to the cockade, the ia<3: is lalfe.
Acc- You took an oath at the Federation
of the 14th of July, which you did not keep :
you fednced Mirabeau to cause an infurrefti
-011 in the departments.
Anf. Ido not reiliember all that puffed at
.hat time, but I know that the whole was pri
or to the acceptance of the conftitutiop.
Acc. You dilii ibuted money to the Faux
bourg St. Ant nine, that the people might fa
vor your escape.
Anf. This accusation is absurd. I ever
took a pleasure in giving money to the people.
Tlie-e was nothing in my conduct that had
the appeal ance of a plot for acounter-revolu
tion.
Acc. Was it not in consequence of the
fame project that you feigned an indilpofition
to facilitate vour retreat to St. Cloud.
An(j No. '
Acc. You swore to maintain the conftitn
fio-,; and on the 2ift of June you attempted
to elcap? with a falfe pafiport, and ordered
your ainifteis to sign no ast of the jegiilature.
A-.f. Idoi' it -emember what pafl'ed at
that tiint ; hut for my Journey to Varennes,
I refer to t'ie answers I'.nade tb the deputies
of the coiiil.tiient affamtyy, who accompanied
me on uajf return.
Acc. You oaiercedwirti La Fayette ; yrru
hired writer of Journal", and ipent consider.
able funis of money to overthrow the confli
tution.
Anf. I recollcft writing one letter to Fay
ette, but have no knowledge of the Fell.
Acc. You favored the rebellion at Aries.
Anf. The ministers did all that, and the
afieinbly proposed ministers to me 1 knew no
thing of.
Ace. You made no attempt to ftifle the
plots of cou-.iter-revolutior, which were ma
nifefted in several parts of the Republic.
Anf. 1 was not apgrifed of thei'e things, I
was informed of nothing; beside*, t would
require time for me to answer all these ques
tions,
Acc. Yon paid your body guards
at Coblentz, and you sent considerable fuuis to
Rochefort and to your brothers.
Anf. J, ceased giving them any thing as
soon as they palled the Rhine.
Acc. You refuled your fan&ion to a de"
cree for forming a camp near Paris ; you or
dered them to be flopped in their march ; the
arrny was not completeâyou ordered no re
cruiting.
An(.Â° I presented at the time the state
ments to the afTembly ; if they were mistaken
it is not my fault.
Acc. You threw confuficn and disorder
in the army.
Anf. I cannot anftver this accusation.
Acc. Wby did you defer so long to inform
the legislative body that fifty thousand Prussi
ans were marching against France ?
Anf. My diplomatic correfpoudence was.
carried on by the ministers, therefore it is
not my fault.
Acc. You fufFered our navy to go to ruin ;
all the oGicers emigrated; there is scarcely
one left for the service.
Anf. I did not feud away thole officers.
Acc. The state was torn by the factions
â¢f the fanatic priests; you shewed yourleif
openly their protector, ard manifested a de
sign ol recovering your former power.
An . I cannot answer that, having no
knowledge of it.
Acc. The legislative aflembly pafled a de
cree against the factious priefts,you suspended
its execution.
Anl. I had a right so to do.
Acc. There were in Paris clandeftir.e as
sociations to operate a counter revolution,
paid by the civlift.
Anf. I have no knowledge of these faA?;
tne project of a counter"-re volution never en
tered my head.
Acc. Who were the members of the con
stituent aftembly you endeavored to corrupt ?
Anf. I never endeavored to corrupt any.
Acc. On the loth of August, you palled in
review the Swift; troops, at 5 o'clock in the
morning, and on that day they fired on the
people.
Ani. The constituted authorities were
"fembled at the callle ; I had demanded a de
putatton to procefcdwith me to the- legiflai.ive
aflembly : when I law that they did not ctu.e,
I repaired thither withall my family. â 
Acc. Why, some days before the 10th of Au
gust, did you order all the polls of the Swiss
guards at the Thutllenes to be doubled ?
Anf. Thecaftle was thieatened ; as I was one
of the conllnuent authorities, 1 had a rignt to
defend mylclf.
The Prtfident thenafked Louis if he had any
thing further to fay.
Louis. I beg the Aflemblj to give me commu
nication of theafctof accusation : I should desire
to,examine it minutely : I should also wiih to
have a counsel.
Marat (hewed h'm all the papers, one after
another; among the papas signed by bis own
hand, he acknowledged but a very few.
The President asked him why he caused a
hole to be made in the wall of hi,s apartment,
and to be covered over with an iron.door.
He anfwercd, that he had no knowledge of
th's.
The President told him, that the Aflctnbly
permitted him 10 retire.
Louis, on retiring, Lid, I have df fired to have
a tounfel,
The Aflcmbly then decreed, that the defireof
Louis 10 have a counfei (hould be granted.
LONDON, December 13.
This besng the firft day of the meeting of
Parliament, his Maje'lty went to the House of
Lords, and being seated on the throne, deliver
ed the "followed most gi'acious speech :
My Lords and Gentlemen^
# HAVING judged it nece(Tary to embody a
part of the militia of this kingdom, I have in
pursuance of the provisions of the law, called
you together within the time limitted for that
purpose, and it is, on every account, a great
fatisfa&ion to me to jneet you in Parliament
at this conjuncture.
I ihould have been happy if I could have
announced to you the fecurc and undifturbeff
continuance of all the bleflings which my fub
je&s have derived from a state of tranquility ;
but events have recently occurred which re
quire our united vigilance and exertion in
order to.preserve the advantages which we
have hitherto enjoyed.
The fediticus pradices which had been in
a great measure checked by your firm and
explicit declaration in,the last fefiion, and by
the general concurrence of my people in the
fame sentiments, have of late been more open
ly renewed, and with increased a&iyity. A
spirit of tumult and disorder, (the natural
consequences of such practices) has Ihewn it
felf in acts of riot and infurreftion, which re
quired the i;iterpofition of a military force in
lupport of the Civil MagistrateâThe industry
employed to exqite discontents on various
pretexts and in different parts oft he kingdom,
has appeared to proceed from a design to at
tempt thetJeftruftion of our happy constituti
on, and the lubveriion of all oftt'er and govern
ment ; and this design has evidently been
pursued iti connexion and concert with pcr
fons in foreign countries.
I have carefully observed a drift-neutrality
in the present war 011 the continent, and have
uniformly abstained from any interference
with refpeft to the internal affairs of France;
but it is impossible for me to fee, without the
most serious uneasiness, the strong and increas
ing indications which have appeared there of
an intention to excite difturfjanees in other
countries, to disregard the rights of neutral
nations, and to pursue views of conquest and
aggrandizement, as well as to adopt towards
my allies the States-General (who have ob
fetved the fame neutrality with myfelf) mea
fu**es which are neither conformable to the
law of nations, nor to the positive ftipuljltions
of existing treaties. Under all these circum
stances I have felt it my indifpenfible duty to
hAve recourse to those means of prevention
and internal defence with which I amentruft
ed by law; and I have also thought it right to
take steps for making some augmentation of
my naval and mTitary force, being persuaded
that these exertions are neceflary in tjie pre
fer t-ftate of affairs, and are best calculated
both to maintain internal tranquility, and to
render a firm and temperate ..condu& effec
tual for preserving the blessings of peace.
Nothing will be neglected on jr.y part that
can contribute to that important object, con
fidently with the fecurtty of my kingdoms,
and with the faithful performance ofenj>a(*e
ments which we are bound equally by interest
and honor to fulfil.
Gentlemen oj the Houjr of Commons y
I have ordered the eitimates for the ensuing
vear to be laid before you ; and I have no
doubt that you will be ready to make a due
provision for the several branches of the pub
lic service.
You will certainly join with me in lament-
ing any necelfiry for extraordinary expences,
which may for a timeprevent tlieapplrcation,
of additional sums those winch are aU
ready annually appropriated to the redu<fri<n
of the public d bt, or retard the relief which
my fubjefts might have derived f om a fur
ther diminution of taxes : but I am confident
you will feel that those great end 1 ! will ulti
mately be belt promoted by such exertions as
are neceflaryfor our prei'ent and future lalety
and tranquility ; and it is a great i onfolation
-tome to reflect, that you will find an pie re
sources for defraying the expetice
of vigorous preparations, from the excess ol
the actual revenue beyond the ordinary ex
penditure.
My Lordi and Gevt/cnen,
I have great oleafure in acquainting you,
that the brilliant fnccefics of the British arms
in India, under the able conduct of the Mar
quis Cornwall!*, have led to the termination
of tie war, by an advantageous and honor
able peace, the terms of which are peculiarly
fatisfaftory to me, from their tendency to
fecura the future tranquility of the Britilh
dominions in that part of the world.
Your attention will now naturally be di
295-
rested to filch measures for the-futnre govern**
merit ufthofe valuable poffelftons, as fliall ap
pear, from experience and full consideration,
iiioft likely to provide for their internal pt of
perity, and to Jbcure the important advanta
ges which may be derived from thence to the
commerce and revenue of this country.
I am persuaded it be the object of yonr
immediate <?onfideration, to adopt (rich me a
fures as may be necdlTary, uiyricr the present
circumstances, for enforcing obedience to the
laws, and for reprefling every attempt to dii
turb the peace and tranquility of these king
doms.
You will be sensible how much depends on
the result of your deliberations, $nd your uni
form conduct: is the best pledge, that nothing
will be wanting on your part which can con
tribute tb the pre fen t fec&rity and permanent
advantage of the country.
I retain a deep and unalterable fer.fe of the
repeated proofs which'l have received of your
cordial and affe&ionate attachment to me;
I place an entire reliance on the contin
uance of these 'entiments, as well as on your
firm determination tb defend'and maintain
that constitution which has so long protected
tke liberties and promoted the happiness of
every class of my fubje&s.
In endeavoring to preserve and transmit to
posterity the inestimable bleijings which, un
der the favor of Providence, you have your,
selves experienced, you may be allured of my
zealous and cordial co-operation ; and our
joint efforts will, I doubt not, he rendered
compleatiy effectual, by the decided support
of a free and loyal people.

GENTLE READER !
The Excise Law has had this great effect
on this Stateâour fruit was f nmerly consi
dered as very Jitt'e worth, but now it bid?
lair to be an article of value and considerable
exportâand more distilleries have been esta
blished this twoyears past, than perhaps, with
out this a<ft of encouragement, would have
been for twenty years.
To avail ourselves of the great
of our former population, and fertility of foil,
and that rank we sustain in the union* no
thing is wanting but industry, a reverence of
the Laws, and appointing those chara&ers tÂ»
rcprefent us in the great Council of tho, Na
tion who, unmindful of fact.on, intrijue ants
felf profit, endeavor, Headily to advance oii*
great and joint agricultural, manuMurinj
aÂ«id commercial inteicfts. .
COMMUNICATIONS.
Thojc who aninadveit on the corrupt influence im
bibed into the government from the spirit oj /pecu
lation m the members, are often called upon to give
names and fads in Jupporf of their charges. The
true and fatisj'aSory anfwsr is, that the*public it
fujjicicntly acquainted zviih niar.y Homes and facts
which need not {herefore be mentioned ; feccndly, that
names and hâ¬ts cannot be called Jor whiljl the
â vfmit* to an authentic d)fclÂ»Jiure thereoj are ftii.it
up againjl injpeflion. Let "the fubfenption ami
transfer books ps the fund?, and the fubfcripiioa
and dilcour.t books ojthe Bank be la'd open and
names snd faÂ£!s will then bc-givch as fully and dear
ly as may he defired-.âQuere y whether the /aid book.t
ought to be locked up again fl a knowledge oj the tranf
atiions of pnfons in puhiic charader \ so that the
people cannot judge oj the function or particular
views oj those entrujled with their interejls t
To those who will not pay attention to the
tranfa<st:ons of government there will be an
appearance of mystery in them. Those who
pay attention with prejudiced and suspicious
minds wili find no left mystery. A man who
pulls a milled tap over bis eyes may well cry
out, I am in the dark ; for the proverb truly
fays, none are so blind as those who will Dot
fee. These remarks apply to those who en
deavor to alarm the jealousies and fears of
the people on the plea that our government is
wrap'd up in darkness and mystery. This
charge on examination will do honor to the
confritution ; for all our money tranfatfions
are by that constitution and by the laws made
in conformity with its spirit, as public and as
carefully checked as it is possible.
ingly it appears, that every dollar received
or expended is brought to account. If it were
as easy to fatisfy jealousy by proof, as it is to
awaken it by groundless hints and half smo
thered whispers, the result of the enquiries
made by the House of Representatives of the
United States, would cqnfirm the confidence
01 the people in the administration of their
national affairs, by ftiewing how (olid a con
stitutional ground it stands on. Every tVanÂ£
the Treasury is publiftied, and the
people mavj jf they will take the pains, by
reading, fee for them-elves the refutation of
the numberless suspicions which have been
whimpered against the government of our
country.
The enemies of government eomplairrof hard
nfage, bccaule their noisy censures of the conftt
tution and adminiftrauon of our country ate im
puted to fclfifh motives. Dmibtlefs there are
many who ast sincerely aud from principleâ,
but a mistaken one, however. But the piople
are called to judge at every ele&ion, whether
the greater part of the furious holders lorlh against
Congress are not candidates for appointments.â
They arcâand he tnuft be blind indeed who
does not fee that the blusterers have made all the
racket merely to draw the attention of the vot
ers. Those who hate levees and the glare of
courts, the me<k fouls who cry equalityâwho
fay that power corrupts the poffeflors, and turns
them into enemies of liberty, behold them in
confiftcntly intriguing, coaxing and lying, to
get an ele&ion. Pure foulsâ-trying to get into
place to lose at once their innocence and attaeh
ment to liberty, not contented with equality,
they would get power which would spoil them.
If sowing discord, jealousy and fruition, arc to
be the luccefsful means of getting into office,
there never will come a year when our political
field will oot bear a great crop.
