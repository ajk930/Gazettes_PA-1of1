fSOM THE COLUMBIAN MIRROR.
Me(T. Smith & Price,
From the diversity of fent'ment which
has lately taken place among citizens in
general, owing to the debates in Congress it.
f|>e&iÂ»g the inefficacv of" regular disciplined
troops, when employed against Indiansâl
cannot, as a citizen, refrain from giving my
.miion aifo ; which is, that militia is by r,o
' i.i'-ails a proper force to be caiijWvcd in <v
tarit regions and against such an enemy- IVli
litia, when acting even in defence of every
thing that is dear to man, and an enemy -at
their doois, have ever been found inadequate
to the obtaining any thing decisive. In fonie
few instances they may have repelled an infe
rior body of their enemy, but they have never
conquered in one out of fifty. It is impoffib'e
that such a class of soldiers, taken suddenly
from the ease and comforts of private life,
can be equal to regulars, who are inured to
every species of fatigue, cold hunger, thirst,
and the thousand other disagreeable circum
stances that occur in long marches and diflant
campaigns.
In a paper which I lately perilled, it is there
asked, who fought the battles of New-jersey,
North-Carolina, Cowpens, South-Carofir.a,
and Georgia ? I will answer, not militia.
Was the battle of Princeton fought by militia?
We't the Hefiians taken at Trenton by mili
tia ? Was the battle of Monmouth fought by
militia? Was the battle of Kutaw fought by
jnilitia*-Was the ftormingof Stony-Pointex
ecuted by militia? Did Genocal Morgan de
feat Tarleton by militia ? Was Col. Lee's
surprise of Paules Hook, and the many brilli
ant actions of that excellent officer in the two
Carolinas, performed by militia ? Did Col.
Samuel Smith defend Mud- Island Fort against
the whole Brit fh fleet in the Delaware, with
militia ? Were the HelEans defeated on Ked
Bank by militia? Was Chamblee, Fort St.
John, Montreal, Src. taken by militia ? Were
those who stormed Quebec militia ? Were
those men who marched through the Indian
country under General Sullivan, militia ? NO
Did they fight .at the battle of Guilford
Court-Hnu'e ? A littleâbut what was the
caufeofit? Small parties of regulars, under
non-conimillioned officers, were drawn up in
their rear with fixed bayonets, which were to
be made use of against them if they offered to
retreat without orders ; thus being in as
much danger from our own ai my as that of
the British, they were of some useâDid they
fight at the battle of Camden, when General
Gates was defeated ? I fay noâthree thou
sand of them ran away, whilst the Maryland
line, the Jersey regiment, and Arniftror.g's
legion, in all not above eleven or twelve
hundred, fought Corawallis's army for twen
ty minutes, hand to hand, until they were
surrounded (owing to the dallardly conduct of
the militia) and even then they charged thro'
their enemy, and the greater part made their
escape. Thus did a handful of regularsâthus
ran three thousand miiitiaâand thus was the
brave Gen. Gates defeated.
Let us now take a view of Indian affairs.
In the year 1793, Gen. Harmer, that real dis
ciplinarian and competent officer, ina r (hed
on an expedition against the Miami Indians.
He had with him part of his own regiment,
which was the lft, and regular they were in
[Whole No. 595."
deed. Ido not know the exa& nÂ«mber of
militia, but am certain they were near two
thirds of his army. lie p-ot to their town*-,
which he totally deft roved, together with all
their crop of corn, &c. On his march the
militia behaved in the 1110 ft unfoldier*like
manner ; firing night and day round his camp,
notwithstanding the niofl pointed orders to
the contrary. One day he dete&ed a militia
man in this breach of general orders : he had
him immediately punished j hut was under
the necessity of loading his artillery, and hav
ing his regulars drawn up in order, that the
punishment might be inflicted undisturbed by
the militia, who threatened very hard on the
occasion ; in fliort, every day he was disturb
ed by their turbulent and difordcrly behavio^.
On his inarch back to Fort Waihingfcon, he
was solicited by the commanding officer of
the militia, for permission to attack a body
of Indians which appeared in his rear, and
that he would engage to retreive their cha
racter, which had fuffered Co materially in the
mind of the Generalâfor he.tnonght, that
though they could not he made to march with
regularity and silence in an enemy's country,
yet itill they could fifth t that enemy if they
appeared. But if a soldier cannot be made to
obfervt orders and pay re "pert to them, I an\
sure he cannot foe inatlgTetigftT, wUtiUl UIIUV
is the more dif agreeable parr of military duty.
Htiwever, to proceed. The General think
ing it nece/Tary to give a check to the Indi
an.';, left they fhoukl harrafs his rear, complied
with the militia officer l 4 requcft, at the fame
time detached'eventy or eighty of the regu
lars to Aipport them, under Major WyHis.
In a fliort time they fell in with a "finall patty
of the Indians, which, I suppose, was Tent for
ward by their main body as a -bait. The few
Indians ran, and nearly t*ie whole of the mili
tia after them, contrary to the most earnest
entreaties of their officer. The regulars dis
played their little column -and formed, flood
the bi unt of neatly the whole force of the
enemy, until they were cut in pieces, except
a few under Capt. Armstrong, who charged
through them and made ffie r retreat âbut
not till they had laid eighty-odd warriors dead
011 the field. The militia who pursued the
few flying Indians, loft fight of their prey in a
fliort time ; but the firing of the party engag

a fufficient tlimulcsfor them to encreaie their
distance : a few got back to the army, and re
ported to the General, that all the reft were
destroyed, whllft a more considerable number
never stopped until they had gained the Ken
tucky ftiore ; and r. Iso reported, that their ab
sent friends were also cut to pieces. This
was called Harmar's defeat, though at tie
fame time he did not lose a single paik-horfe,
nor a man more than was facrificed by the
gallant behaviour ojthof;javaritc Indian jighttr*.
1 fliall now beg leave to touch a little -on
the conduct of those iniinrii/es who accompa
nied the army of Gen. St. ClairâWhen they
firft joined, they wee in number about 4Â°Â°S
but owing to desertion, there were not, on
the day oflwttle, more than 300. Through
out the whole march, after their jnnftion, they
kept the camp in a constant alaim by tbeirir
regular condue>, and firing round the pickets
and out posts, often in the dead hour of the
n'ght. Gen. St. Clair threatened and remon
strated with them, informing them how dan
gerous it was, inafinnch as it favored the ap
proach of an enemy ; for it would be impnl
fible to devise whether it was the pickets fir
ing at the Indians, or the inilitia fhoot'mg
bears.
Thiswas not the only part of their conduct
that, in my opinion, tended to the defeat of
the army. A few days bofore the acftion a
whole company, at least 63 or 70 of them,de
ferted ; the firft regiment was detnehed in
pursuit of them, as well as to prevent their
plundering the provision which was on the
road, and expected to arrive in a short time.
There was I believe a third reason for throw
ing this regiment in the rear, which was t<>
deter others of the militia from this difgrace
ful retrogade.
A third reason why I think they were in
ftruinental in the defeat of t! army is as fol
lows : When the tropns on the evening pre
ceding the fatal 4th of November, 1791, halt
ed and encamped, the militia, who wiflict! to
be separate from the regulars, were advanced
one quarter ofÂ» mile over a small river that
ran along the front of the encampment : the
pickets of the army were ported at about the
fame distance in the rear, with the proper
camp and flank guards, stationed in fuel) a,
manner, as to prevent a surprise or sudden at
tack iii its then position. After dark, it ap
pears a tew guns were fired at foir.e distance
over the river where the militia was posted j
but it was as much to be presumed, that they
were firing at the stars as at the enemy; how
ever, the Adjutant-General was sent over the
river with orders to their commander, that
at about an honr before day he fliould divide
t'ne men into Several parties of about 20 or 30
each, with an officer at their head, and move
011 in different directions towards the Indian
villages. But alas! they were still militia;
no attention was paid to these orders. DayÂ»light appeared, they were attacked, ran in
confulion, made not the least refillai.ee, and
tlÂ»eir commander, the brave Oldham, was
ilain in attempting to raily them.
A few moments before the flight of the mi
litia, the troops were difmifTed from their
posts (where they had been (landing under
arms at least two hours) for the purpofa of
cooking their vi&nals ; when the firft thing
that announced the approach of the enemy,
was the militia plunging through the nver Â»
I'moft a quarter of an inch thick ot ice, and
the Indians, with horrid yells, at their heels.
The army was surrounded in a few minutes,
and a dreadful and deadly fire commenced ;
the soldiers stoOd to their tackle, charged,
drove the enemy, returned to their line and
charged again when ordered { and, as thÂ£ gen
tleman from North-Carolina fays, 4 they
fought like regulars, stood ttke regular, and,
poor fellows, they died like regulars." But
had the militia acted as regulars, by obeying
orders, and firing on the enemy as they ad
vanced, and given time for the army to dis
play into an ofFenfive position, instead ot a de
ienfive one, they would have advanced on their
enemy like regulars, fought like regulars, and
eonqnered like regulars.
1 hope, from these statements of fa&s, that
every unprejudiced person will allow, that
the militia was the principal cause -of Har
mer's rubb, and St. Clair's defeat.âDwelt as
I have so long upon the defeat of regular ar
mies, it is almost time to fay something of mi
litia vi&ories.
A late one of which has been brought tor
ward to support the argument, that militia
is the only species of troops proper to fight In
dians. An officer with upwards of ioo militia
been to Fort Jefferfon, with a quantity
of provifions,&c. for theufe ot that garrifori ;
on his return he encamped at Fort St. Clair,
having under his escort 200 horses ; about
the dawn of day, on the 6th of last November,
4ie was attacked by a pjfty of Indians, his
men flew to a Urge flockade (which was built
for the, purpose ps securing horses) in the mean
â t4m& r -the Â«ncmy cavgbt and carried off all
theiF borfes and plundered their camp ; how
ever the officer colle&ed 4Â° Â°r 50 of his men,
and engaged part of the enemy, but it was too
late, the Indians had gained their point by car
rying off their hooty, with the loss of only two
men. Thus fifty militia out of 100 foughi,
killed two Indians, loft 200 borfes, and all
their camp- A brilliant affair indeed !âBut
a most enormous price to pay for the car cases
of two savages.âSuch victories as these, con
tinued for a (hort time, would exhaust the
mines of Mexico or Peru.
I fliall make a few more observations be
fore I conclude, concerning this strange Idea
which prevails in the minds of fomc refpeft
ing regulars and militia. The member of
Congrels from North-Carolina, revert? to
what the militia of his country had done dur
ing the late war. He lays, they fought from
a love of their country, that they were men
of bravery, men of principle, fee. &C. And
alks, will such men enlist in a regular army?
1 wjil iuftrec. that if iiieb men
fift m *We regular army, when the liberties of
their country were at stake, it is not to be ex
pected that they will now enlist andjmarch 6 or
700 miles to fight Indians. If there is an art,
or a peculiar method to be pra&iled in fight
ing in a woody country, cannot a person un
der fubordinatlnn, and acquainted with all the
duties of a soldier, be taught it as well as a
militia man who is under none, and not ac
quainted with any fort of military duty, who
knows nothing more than {hooting a rifle,
and who will only make use of it against an
enemy when he thinks proper J Indeed, I
think amulket ball, fired' at an Indian behind
a tree, would do as much execution that
of a rifle.
A regular, well organized and disciplined
army, is the only one we can export fuccels
from. Sucli that, by order, can in an inftqnt
be thrown into any position, that can be divi
ded into a number of parties, march in dif
ferent directions, though in presence of an
enemy, and return to their line only by the
beat of a drum or found of a trumpet. Will
militia do this ? Did tlieyeverdo it ? No, not
<U the drums and trumpets in the victorious
French army, would ever rally or Hop a rout
ed militia. When I hear of the alhes of tnofe
heroes, who gallantly fell at their poll the fa.
tal 4th of November, raked up to lie put in
competition with a corrupt, infective militia,
it makes me' shudder. I will allow militia to
have supported one post well, that is, the old
adage,
Those who Jight and run azvav,
" H ill live to Jight another day."
And farther I will allow them,
u That'when a Jight becomes a chafe,
" They win the fight who coin the race."

MONDAY, January ai.
Sketch of the l)ef>ate on the hill authorizing a
loan of the balances due on a finalfettlement
of accounts from the United States to indivi
dual States.
Mr. GILES moved, that the proviso in the
second fedlion of the bill fliouid he flruck out,
refpc&ing the aflent of the individual dates to
tte new loan, as it does not agree with the idea
precisely, coiitained in the rsiolutior.s on which
the bill wa6 founded; and adverting to the pro
vilion contained in the funding law refpe&ing
these balances, hÂ« observed, that the bill now re
ported interfered with the disposition of the
balances, whereas that law ha* veiled the dispo
sal of them exclusively in the several dates.
A CIT.
Mr. Fitzfimons said, that there was a varia
tion in the proviso in the bill, from that in the
sriginal resolutions, which had accidentally tak
en place; he said, that the variation was cer
tainly not in order, and he therefore moved, that
the proviso in the bill (hould be amended so us to
conform to the resolutions.
Mr. Sedgwick remarked, that the gentleman
lad speaking was undoubtedly right in refpecft
to the order, but he did not draw the
fame condulion : The proviso in the bill may
vary from that in the resolutions; but if it more
completely comports with the ideas of a majori
ty of the committee, he saw no good reason for
not adopting it. He added some observations on
the remarks of Mr. Giles, which he conildered
as making it a queflion, whether the govern
ment ihould literally comply with its engage
ments 01* notâthis, he hoped, would never be
made a subject of debate in the legislature of the
United States.
Mr. Fitzfimons said, he hoped the amend
ment which he l'uggefted, would take place.
Mr. Clark observed, that he thought the bill
was altogether wrong; he moved therefore, that
it Ihould be re-committed. Mr. Clark entered
into a general confide ation of the fubjedt, but
spoke unusually low.
Mr. Lawrence was in favour of the committee's
rising; he cited an instance in point, which oc
curred the last session.âA feletfk committee on
the census had exceeded the limits of the princi
ples agreed to in the committee of the whole,
the bill they reported was accordingly re-com
mitted; the houTe Would not then consent to
altering the bilj lb the House, as it would sanc
tion a deviation stain eftaMilhed principles.
. Murray was opposed to the committee's
rilinghe law no occaiion for it; the variation
is merely verbal, and can be easily corrected.
The question tor the committee's riling was
put, and agreed to. They accordingly rose and
reported progress. On motion, the committee of
the whole was discharged. The bill was then re
committed to the felefi committee, which re
ported it. The requisite alteration beiwr
made, the bill, as amended, was reported to
the House, twice read and referred to a com
Â» mittee of the whole.'
Mr. Steele ajjt'ii in the chair.âTJ.c co.T.t*!,
tee proceeded in the difcuflian of tile btil.
Mr. Mercer, after Hating that variom
friendly remarks were made on the govcrunirct
and on particular members,in confequenie cfrtt
former assumption; and informing thccaauniu
tee that there was a large sum of the paper :r.
ney of a particular Hate in this toxvn, which
was felling at lot. in tl>e pound, observed tin;
this bill would probably appreciate the value 0 f
that paper perhaps to ios. in the pound. In or
der, therefore, to give the fulleft information to
the people of the United States, and to prevent
those at 7 or 800 miles distance from being de
frauded, he moved an ajrtndmenr, the objed of
which was to prevent tcrtificatu which h*ve
been transferred within 6 certain period from
being fuhferibed to the â¢
Mr. Fltifimons said, Â« he had brought for
ward the resolutions -ibn -which the bill wu
founded ; he thought it incumbent on him to
notice the observations advanced by the gentle
man in fnpport of his motion He remarked
that with rcfpe<& to the general fcntiment of the
people, perhaps he knew as little about it as 9-
thers; but this he knew, that if unfavourable
impressions had not been made, it was not be
eaufe attempts had been wanting for that pur
pose, on the part of individuals within these
wallsâWith refpeft to himfelf he felt no solici
tude; but if any member of this House knew of
any fads of the kind alluded to by the gentle
man, let the person who knows of such things
boldly come forward and charge openly the
guilty, with relpcfl to the present motion, he
would have ho obje&ion to it, provided it did
not interfere with the general provisions of the
bill.
Mr. Bourn said, he ihould be in favour of the
motion, provided it was pra&itable; but he
did not fee how it could be carried into execu*
tion.
Mr. Williamfon supported the motiorl. He
said it met hi* approbation so far as it would cdn
duce to prote&ing the original holders of the
f.ate debts from such speculations as they fuffer
ed by, at the time of the former assumption.
Mr. Sedgwick remarked on the rapid rife of
the value of the paper, in consequence of the for
mer assumption, and said, that considering what
human nature was conftitu'ed of, the fpeculajtU
ctytt alluded to, and which he had lamented
a$ much as any man whatever, were to have
been expc&ed. He then adverted particularly
to the remarks of Mr. Mercer, in which he had
said he had his ftifpicioris even of the members
of the House. Mr. Sedgwick said, the earsuf
members had been often assailed by insinuations
and suspicions of the base condu<st of individuals
in this House, as speculating iji their own tr.ea
fujes. if, said Mr. Sedgwick, there is so base
and infamous a character within these walls; if
there is one member of this House who has been
guilty of this abominable condu<ft, of plundering
his constituents of their property, in the manner
represented, let his pame be mentioned, let the
man be pointed out. From the pare he had taken
in this business from the beginning, and frnm
the iuggeftions which hrad been he
had some rtafort so suppose it might be be intend
ed to implicate him in the charge. He could not
help feeling himfelf called upon to notice such
indilcnniinateinffmiations, fych attempts to af
fix a lligma on particular charaftersâmenwhofe
reputation is theft dearest poffeflion. Mr. Sedg
wick then offered several obje&ions to the mo
tion ; he remarked that its tendency would be
to keep open the door of/peculation.
Mr. Mercer replied to Mr. Sedgwick; he
observed, that his remarks weredirÂ«&ad to hu
man natnre at large; he considered it as a point
not to he controverted that temptation, in pro
portion to its extsnfive and flattering profpedts,
would always have an influence ; for himfelf,
he could neveryrilh to have his own horour and
integrity put. to the test, He fubferibed to the
sentiments of Mr. Sedgwick refpe&ing the sa
cred nature of reputation, and repeated the lines
from Shakespeareâ'" He that robs me of hiy
good name, &c.
Mr. White said hÂ« disapproved of the princi
ple on which the amendment was brought for
ward. He believed the aspersions on the mem
bers of Congress, were totally unfoundedâHe
did not doubt but [peculations had been carri
ed on to a very great extent, during the depend
ence of the funding system; but this could not
be avoided; men would venture according to
their opinion of the final event of the meafare â â
and priccs would consequently fluctuate. When
the proposition for difcriminatiou was brought
forward, the price of paper fell; when it was
reje&ed, the price rose again. It was probably
the fame with regard to the slate debts, in the
various (tages of the business; bnt surely nofuf
picion of improper conduct could fall on those
who voted uniformly either for or against the
measure. Indeed the above has generally fallen
on those who opposed the aflumption in the ex
tent firft proposed, and voted for it as finally
modified. These were but five in number; they
were easily known ; three yet retain their feats,
two are of fame ft ate with the gentleman 1
who offefed the amendment, and are not now
members of the House; that he was of the
number, and he was confident that no man ap
plying the charge of speculation to himfelf or
to any one of those whÂ» voted with him, would
believe there was the ftiadow. of truth in it; but
he would attend to the difeuffion ; and however
be might difiike the reason afugned for offering
the amendment, if he found any good likely to
arise from it, would give it his vote.
Mr. Mercer's remarks brqught up several
other members, who severally, adverffhg to the
circumflances attending the patting the funding
a&, shewed that tho* they had voted for the sys
tem, that they were i.ot influenced byperfonal
considerations. '
The motion of Mr. Mercer was repeated y
modified and altered, and then further debate .
Mr. Barnwell said, he disapproved of the mo
tion ; it appeared to be a very extraordinary. measure indeed; the oftenfibk motive is to pre
vent Speculation, but it will have diredlly the
contrary effeift. The way, in his opinion, to pre
sent speculation, was to appreciate the value of
the certificates in the hands of the holders; but
what will be the effect of this measure ? it will
- lessen the value of the paper immediately, by
preventing the pofleffor from transferring thÂ«
property âThis he considered as a retrofpe&ive
measure, and that the government had no rig t
ta abridge the right of ttansferring; it is a qua
lity of the property, and cannot be taken away
l>y any subsequent law. He considered the mea
sure as countera&ing the principles of the bill
altogether, the of which is to give a
â Value to the paper i#the hands of the owners.
-In every view 'of (tic proportion he was opr
j>ofed to it j and cho' It appears designed to I)<>
uefit the distant creditors, yet he felt fa fulljr
â¢yerfuadecl that it woiljd operate to the disadvan
tage of his constituents, that he ihould under e
.very modification vote against it.
Mr. Madison replied to Mr. Barnwell; hp
â¢observed, that the gentleman argued from pro
per principles, if they had bien applied to a dif
ferent cafe. The present proposition of provid
ing for these balances is a voluntary buiinefs,
which this government is under no obligation to
engage in ; but having engaged in it, the mea
sures it may adopt on the occasion, have no ne.
eeffary reference to, or connection with the ge
neral regulations under which the paper now ex
istsâthe government- may make just what ar
rangements it thinks proper. The provision
now contemplated, he remarked, was however
to be juftified on itsown merits; the uses and the
confluences rcfulting from it, were designed to
be salutary; and with refpeiSl to persons remote
from the feat of government, who are equally
entitled to prote&iori in every sense with those
who reside there, they .would evidently be bene
refited by the regulatitÂ®
Mr. Murray oppofod the motion, as being
bofttttrto the jmblir Â£uth, involving eojinfrac
tion of that feith,. so far at least: as
of the certificates have bfcen enhanccdin confo
quence of what has already been done.
Several other members fpok< on the oCcasion,
the motion wag at length negatived by the com
mittee.

The EiU to authorise a L.oan in th: Notes
or Certificates of the fever al States which,
on a final Settlement of AccountsJhaU have
a Balance, due to them from the United
Statesâhaving been read the third timeâ*
the Que/Hon, {hall the 'Bill pass ? was
put by tie Speaker :
Mr. Hartley.âl have attended to the debates
en this bill, and considered the fubje&âand am
fully convinced that the bill ftiould pass.
By the atft for fettling (he accounts between
the United States and individual states, the ba
lances were aHumed to be paid to the creditor
states.
The bill under consideration gives the alter
native'to jhall be/Â©mtd-e cre
ditor) either to receive the balance berfelf and
pay it to Her citizens, or fuifer them to fund
their certificates with the general government.
I believe it will Be found, on experience, most
convenient to the creditor, and least expensive
to the people, for the creditors, to fubferibe to a
loan with the general government. This, how
ever, will reft in a great measure upon the in
dividual states. Two taxes will be more, expen
sive to collect than one ; and if money is to go
through two hands, iaftead of one, in general it
is attended with a double charge.
It is said, that the bill will,offer a new field
for âIt is polfible that to a certain
degree, there may be weight in the observation ;
but after the experience we have had, the hold
ers of certificates will not be eufily imposed up
onâand it the certificates of the individual
states would be equalized, I am led to believe,
that it would be ol'l'ervice to the community.
They mijjht, in a confiderabie degree, a<Sl as
a medium in commerce, and in the transfer of
property : but whilst they remain at different
values, they will be mere objects of specula
tion. - 4-
I regret exceedingly the great inequality of
Fortune, which has arisen among citizens, by
the speculations in our paper; but in a great
and mighty revolution, fofne partial evils mud
be expe<sfced, to obtain a general good. We are
bound to pay our debts.
I do not think that a large national debt is a
blefling, but it is of high importance that the
government which is in debt (hould so dispose
of it, as to do as little injury as possible, and if
the fame is practicable, produce a partial good.
In Penafylvania our affairs appear to be in

Yet I imagine if it is pubhfhed, and the reasonÂ«

If wcpafs die ad thisfeffion, we shall save
the hext Congress from much trouble and per
plexity. We adt now upon principleâwithout
knowing how the balances will operate. If the
creditor and debtor dates were known, jt would
be found exceedingly difficult to reconcile the

Remember the Representative billâthe go

account of the various interests.
Much has been said about the interelled mo

COMMUNICATIONS.
A writer in the National Gazette is of opi
nion, that the people should riot tleft men to
office who maintain principles inconsistent with
the nature of tbe government. He fays, it would
be absurd to trufl the fox with oar poultry, or
the wolf with our lambs. The fentimcnt is cer
tainly in ft. We take it for certain, that the
writer intended to express his idea of the ex
treme unfitness of cnttufting an high federal ofÂ«
sice to an antifederaliil of such implaeable pas
sions as Gov* C â¢
The National Gazette has an aiticle from a
ctoriefpondent, which fuppÂ»>fes the people of
Coone&icut to be inclined towards monarchy.
The writej Ims not given his reaions in support
of the opinion. - But in such a moment, us con
cern, it is fit to consider the danger of the cafe.
Lord (hip?, it is agreed, arc the forerunners of
monarchy. Now Conne&icut is divtded into
Lordships. Those who have no: fcen the state,
will.he surprised to hear, that Â»t is full (if Lords
of Manors. The rights of these Lords to their
Manors, and over them, are of the Aristocratic
genus. For eacfvof these Lords luppofes him
felf fnlly juftifted in driving the people out of his
po(lc(soQs. keeps all the good things to
bimTcU and his family fcnd and'fco! a
foul J. 5 fuffcred to ride his horfc or gather hi*
crops agamft his will. Theft: exclusive lordly
pr.vilejes a.e truly (hocking* to thofc who ab
hor lurh lordships, 'nil whojullly desire to have
ihem Ih a red m common.
The extreme ignorance Â«>f the people in that
State, has piobatoly prepared them for this de
graded lit ion. For men iruly enlightened
as to the ir right to eujoy the earth in coinmon,
would !onÂ£ ago have abolifh<a th?i proud*arif
tocraty. They howiver in that Stale do rÂ»oc
know what ii is to be born again mo a new po
litical world. They tven dunk the. federal
coirftuuuonÂ»the belter for being djvided into
three branches. They difttuifc and defptfe as
fcypocrrtrs and knaves the iufp ifgif 'qfoimers of
ouf\ corrupt fend abominable government,, whn
would reform <js into a Hate of nature. Ac
cordingly they i/icline to chul'e men into offecc
under the Coiiftiiutioti, who wowlcj not deikiuy
it by treachcry and lies. They keep tÂ»j> schools,
and so much the woiftâfo* their chjldten are
taught ihe old-fafhioned and damnable hereftea
which inculcate orderâtefpift lor rulerÂ®âthe
rights and duties of manâto reverence the reli
gion of their fathers, to follow virtue thein
fcK-es, and to refpell those who do so. Thus
oven in youth opinion Tivets her chains oil the
mind ; and nothing is to be hoped for from
Cooncfticutâbut as they have Lords already,
and such general ignorance that our initiu&ion
ts thrown away upon them, we mnil leave them
to {heir evil and perv,erfc ways. If .however
they (hould run mad, and set up a K,ing, it will

reflly on the river, will be fold, with the im
provements, which are, a two-story framed
dwclling-hbufe, neatly finished, a kitchen, office,
brick smoke-house and dairy, two-story framed
bam, a well of excellent water, and aa ice
houte, a yard and garden, neatly railed and
highly improved, with a number of other ne
ceflarv improvements ; the whole of the land
enclofcd with posts and rails, ten or fifteen acres
laid down, with different kinds of grass. Its
contiguity to those three towns mud render it Â»*>
obj-& worthy the attention of any person who
wifbes to invest money in a property that mult
enhancc in value, in proportion 10 the rapid in
crease of the Federal City, Alexandria and
George-Town. This property lies nearly in a
central situation to each place. The Potowmsck
at this spot has a fine deep Ibore and harbour,
capable of receiving veflels of any burden. It
may not be improper to observe, that men of
judgment think a profitable and convenient
Ferry might be creeled here to the Citv of
Washington and the Maryland Chores leading to
Baltimore aod Philadelphia.â Also to fell, 215
acres of Wood-Land, about three miles distant,
which will futt well to supply the above in
wood and timber. The title may be seen to the
above property, which is indisputable, and terms
known by application to the fubferiber, living
on the premises.
RAN away on the 25th instant, a likely Ne
gro Man called Laac, about twenty-three
years oid, five feet fix or eight inches high, a
well made fellow, fond of talking, has a large
mouth, and shows his teeth very much when
talking ; had on when he went away, a brown
linen shirt, a (hort white kersey over jacket with
a very high collar and plain breast, with buttons
which appear to have been very gay ; a pair of
white kersey bretches, a pair of while knit yarn
(lockings, a pair of (hoes'with firings in them,
and a coarfc hat ; all the above clothes are al
most new. Said Negro was fprmeily the pro
perty of Mr. William Thomas, late of Kent
County, near GeorgeÂ« Town Cross Roads, dt j
ceafcd, and has for Several yean been emploved;
in that neighbourhood, and principally by a Mr,
Maxwell, and lately by MeilYs. John and James
Carmack, as a waggoner, which business he is
well acquainted with, and is what he prefers;
and has been engaged drivings waggon from
said Cross-Roads to Duck-Creck, &c. until
August last. I expect he will make his way [or
the neighbourhoods ot Georgt-Town, Duck-
Creek, Dover or Wilmington. The above re
waid will be paid if delivered to me in this
place, or Thirty Dollars if fecQtcd in any goal,
so that I get him again. He is an aitiul Icliow,
and when taken, will make his escape, unlets
