NATIONAL CONVENTION,
LETTER
From Thomas Paine to thi People
of France,
" Paris, Sept. 2J, 1792.
" First year of the KepUblic.
" FELLOW CITIZENS !
I RECEIVE will) affectionate gra
titude the honor which the late
national aflembly has conferred up
on me, by adopting ine a citizen of
France ; and the additional honor
of being elected by my fellow-citi
zens a member of the national con
tention. Happily imprefied as 1 am,
by those testimonies of respect fliewn
towards me as an individual, I ieel
iny felicity increased by feeing the
Kr(iV(*c rr'
patrioiifm by spots of earth, and li
mited ciiizenfhip to the foil, like
vegetation.
" Had those honors been confer
red in an hour of national tranqui
lity, they would have afforded no
other means of {hewing mv affecti
on, than to have accepted and en
joyed them ; but they come accom
panied with cii ctimflances that give
me the honorable opportunity of
commencing my citizenship in the
itormy hour of difficulties. 1 come
not to enjoy repose. Convinced
that the caofe oÂ£ France is the eaufe
of all mankind, and that as liberty
cannot be purchased by a wish, I
gladly lhare with you' the dangers
and honors neceflary to success.
" I am well aware, that the mo
ment of any great change, such as
â T-at acc,jr:*.;-!i flicd on lT.c i-o-h of"
August, u unavoidably the'noinent
of terror and cunfufion. The mind
highly agitated by hope, suspicion
and apprebenfion, continues with
out relt till the change be accom
plilhed. But let us now look calm
ly and confidentially forward, and
success is certain. It is no longer
the paltry cause of kings,-or of this,
or of that individual, that calls
France and her armies into a<ffion.
It is the cause of all. It is the esta
blishment of a new era, that shall
blot despotism from the earth, and
fix, on the lasting principles of peace
and citizcnfhip, the gre?t republic
of man.
" It has been my fate to have
borne a /herein the commencement
and complete eflablifliment of one
revolution, (I mean the revolution
of America). Tlie success and e
vents of that revolution are encou
raging to us. The prolperity and
h;ippinefs that have since flowed to
that country, have amply rewarded
her for all the hardlhips (he endur
ed, and for all the dangeis flic en
countered.
" The principles on which that
revolution began, have extended
ihemiejves to Europe ; and an over
ruling Providence is regenerating
the old woi M by (he principles of
the new. The difiance of America
i roil) all the other parts of the globe,
did not admit of her carrying of
those principles beyond her own li
tnation. It is to the peculiar honor
of France, that (lie now railes the
standard of liberty for all nations ;
Â»i d in fighting her own battles, con
tends for the rights of :â¢ ] 1 mankind.
" 1 lie fame spirit of foititude
infilled I'uccel's to America,will
inftii e it to t ranee j for it is impof
fiblc to conquer a nation determi ned

ttanoes that now unite them(elves

of thu earth know nothing of, and
can form no calculation upon. The)'

cuituuu'd to make war upon each
January 2, 1795.
other ; and rhey know from fyftetn
and practice, how to calculate the
probable success of despot agaiiift
despot ; and here their knowledge
and their experience end.
" But in a contell like the pre
sent, a new and boundless variety ot
circumstances arise, that derange all
such culiomary calculations. When
a whole nlktion ails as an army, the
despot knows not the extent of the
power against which he contends.
New armies rife againit him with
tlie neceflity of the moment. It is
then that the difficulties of an inva
ding enemy mulriply, as in the for
mer cafe they diminiflied ; and he
finds them at their heighth when he
expected them to end.
" The only war that has any fi
inilarity of circumstances with the
present, is the late revolution-war
is in France, it was a war of the
whole nation. There it was that
the enemy, by beginning to con
quer, put himfclfin a condition of
being conquered. His firft victories
prepared him for defeat. He ad
vanced (ill he could not retreat,and
found himfelf in the midst of a na
tion of armies.
" Were it now to be' proposed to
the Aullrians and Prulliails to escort
them iuto the middle of France,and
there them te'make the inoft
of such actuation, they would fee
too much into the dangers of it to
accept the offer ; and the fame dan
gers would attend them, could they
arrive there by any other means.
Where then is the military policy
of their attempting 10 obtaiir, by
fort'*;, that which they would refufe
by choice; But to reason with oci
pots,is throwing reafoii away. The
best of arguments is a vigorous pre
paration.
" Man is ever a stranger to the
ways by which Providence regulates
the order of things. The interfe
rence of foreign despots may serve
to introduce into their own enilaved
countries the principles they come
to oppose. Liberty and equality are
bleflings too great to be che inhe
ritance of France alone. It is* ho
nour to her tobe rhef.r!t chanijUon ;
and (Tie may now fay to her enemies,
with a mighty voice, " O ! 'ye A uf
trians ! ye Prulfians ! ye who now
turn your bayonets againlt us ; it is
for you j it is for all Eutope; it is
for all mankind, and not for France
alone, that flie raises the Itandard
of liberty and equality !"
" The public caule has hitherto
fufFered from the contradictions
contained in the conflitution of the
former condiment aflembly. Those
contradictions have served to divide
the opinionsof individuals at home,
and to obfeure the great principles
ot the revolution in other countries.
But when those contradictions fliall
be removed, and the conflitution be
niadeconformable to the declaration
of rights; when the bagatelles of
monarchy, royalty, regency and he
reditary fucceflion, lhall be exposed,
with all their absurdities, a new ray
of light will be thrown over the
world, and the revolution will de
live new strength by being univer
sally underflood.
" The scene that now opens it
felf to France, extends far beyond
thÂ« boundaries of her own domini
ons. Every nation is becoming her
colleague, and every court is become
her enemy It is now the cause of
all nations against the cause ot all
courts. The terrors that despotism
felt, clandeflinely begot a confede
ration of despots ; and their at
tack upon France fe produced by
their fea:s at home.
" In entering on this great scene,
greater than any nation lias yet
beeu called to a<s in, let us fay to
245
tin jcvtarcvf nind, be calm. Let
us puuifh by iuftructing, rather than
by revenge. Let us begin the new
sraby a greatness of friendfhip,and
hail the approach of union and suc
cess. Your Fellow-Citizen,
" THOMAS PAINE."

Letter from General Montefquiou.
' I AM hitherto informed, by the public
prints of rne decree which pronounces
my difjliflian ; I have officially received that
Mfhich suspends its effert.
I refpeft, as I ought, the decrees of the peo
ple's repreientyfives. Thsy ought to rcjeft
the Cervices of'thofe who were suspected, the
moment they put fufficient confidence in my
accusers, to regard their assertions is pi oofs.
If truthcouid lmeiven heaid, the national
Convention fhoiild haye known that all which
was told tliem was a collection of impofit'.ons ;
they ihould have known that I had never pe-'
tioned nor adhered to any petition ; that the
statement presented by me tu the legislative
aliombfy, cf the Kii sos Sardinia's forces, is
perfectly exact ; that it is the executive coun
cil which had forbid the attack of Savoy; and
that it was my prefllng feprcfentntion, the re
peated communication of my plan, and my
proinife of success, which determined the exe
cutive council to give me the liberty to ast ;
it fhonld have known that the fables repeated
by fevcral journalifh,on the infalubritv of the
ca. Ps I had chosen, were so many li.*s } it
flujlrf have known, in fliort, that the most
honor; blc confidence of my army, is a re
ward ior all my trouble.
I have the happiness to do a service to my
country and to mankind, in introducing the
ft uidard of liberty among a good people, who
appeal- to me worthy ot this great benefit.
No facrifiee has poisoned this happiness. The
satellites of despotism have every where fled
before an army of citizens.
Sav: y is as much French as the eighty three
dep o , tnients, and its attachment to the nati
on has already reflected honor 011 the general
who firft planted the tree of liberty on a
foreign Bastille.
My race is run, and I can no longer hope to
oe ultrful.
A general who has been once beset by sus
picion, on whom the national convention lias
once imprinted the seal of public miltrnft,can
110 longer act with a receilary spirit of free
dom, with that inward and communicated
len time r,t oi'intentions,always pure and loyal.
Those whose intrigues have once followed me,
can ngver forgive my having conquered Sa
voy, 011 the day they denoune'ed me as a trai
tor. Every one of my operations would be
croiTed ; every trap set by the enemy would
be denounced as a treason : secrecy, the foul
of success, would always hide some fu petted
intention.
I.therefore demand, Mr. PreGdent, and I
demand it prefiing!v,from a love for my coun
try, from attachment and gratitude to an ar
my to whom I am much indebted, that ano
ther general be named in my place : Nothing
can deface the decree of the 23d of Septem
ber, and it is necHfary that the citizen who
commands a French army, should be not only
purej' but free from suspicion.
I solicit only one favor, that I may be per
mitted to return home, there to enjoy my
rights of a citizen, and to prove, by the ob
fcuriiy of my lite, that if ever I had an am-
it was that of serving my country.

A debate followed on tSe fuhjedl of general
Montefquiou's letcer, in which it was propos

difcflion, it was adjourned till thecommiflion

A petition was then presented from the sec

collecting an armed fbrce round the conven

A debate followed, in whicji it was hinted
that the members were afraid of their situa

The petition was sent to the committee to
report on it in three days.

J
O&riber is,DECLARATION
of the DUKE of BitUNSWICIC.
[Read to the French National Convention by
M. HRJSSOT.]
WHEN their Majeftics, the Emperor and
the King of PrufiVa, in confiding to me the
command of t'ie armies which thele two allied
Sovereigns have caUsed to uiai ch into Fiance,
made me the organ of their intention , let
forth in the two declarations oi the 25th and
27th of July 1792, their Majeities were far
from conceiving the pofTibility of thole scenes
of horror, which preceded and brought on tbe
imprifonmentof their Majeftics, the King and
Oueen of France, and the Royal Family.-â
[This gave rile to some murmurs.]
[M. Briflot here obJerved, that the only
anlwef he should make to this manifefto, was
that Gener-d Duinoui ier had it printed and
distributed in his army; the good eifefts of
â which were found in the increased courage
imd provoked indignation of the soldiers. He
proceeded in the reading of it.]
Such attrocious a&s, of which nations in
the least degree civilized have not yet (hewn
an example, were nevertheless not the ex
treme bounds, which the audacity of certain
Â£i6tious men, who had contrived to render
the people of Paris the blind initruments of
their will, had set to their guilty ambition.
The fupprellion of all the King's function*,
which had been reserved to him by that very
conditution, which has been so long cried up
as the vow of the whole nation, was the lad
crime of the National Aflfembly, which has
brought upon France the two dreadful scour
ges of war and anarchy. [FÂ»efh murmurs.]
BriiTot.âl request silence, if it be only
through pity.]
To perpetuate these evils, there remained
but one step to be taken, which could be dic
tated only by that mad spirit, the fatal fore
runner of the fall of empires, whicfi has seized
upon those men who didinguifh themselves by
the title of deputies of the nation, chufen to
confirm its lights and happiness, upon the
mod fnbftaiitial basis. The fir ft decree which
they p.afied in their AflTembly, was the aboli
tion of royalty in France ; and the senseless
acclamation of a small number of individuals,
of whom even several were strangers, claimed
the right of overthrowing the judgment of
fourteen generations, who have filled the
fourteen centuries of the exidence of the
"French monarchy.
This proceeding at which the enemies of
France alone should rejoice, if they fuppoftd
that it could have a lading effect, is in direct op
position to the firm resolution, which their Ma.
jedies the Emperor and the King of Pruflia have
Â£aken, and from which those two allied Sover
eigns will never depart, to restore to his Mod
Chridian Majedy his liberty, fafety, and royal
dignity, or to wreak a judand ftgnal vengeance
on those who shall date any longerto violate or
infringe upon them.
For these reasons, the undersigned declares to
the French nation in general, and to each parti
cular individual, that their Majcdics, the Empe
ror and the Xing of Pruflia, invariably attached
10 the principle of not medling in the interior
government of France, (a pealoj laughter) perfid
nevertheless to require that his Mod Chridian
Majedy, together wuti all the royal family,fhall
be immediately fei at libeity, by those who pre
sume to keep them imprisoned. Their Majef
lies also infid, that the royal dignity in France
ihall be, without delay, re-tdablilhed in the per
son of Louis XVI. and his fucceflors : (another
and louder burjl oj laughter) And furtherâthat this
royal dignity (hall be secured from any such af
front in future.
If the French nation has not entirely lod fight
of its true intereds, and if, free in its resolutions,
it is desirous of putting a dop quickly to ail tnc
calamities of a war, which exposes so many pro
vinces to all the evils attendant upon the march
of an army, it will not delay an indant to de
clare its opinion in favor of the peremptory de
mands which I make in the name rheir Ma
jedics the Emperor and the King of Pi uflia ; and
which, in cafe of a refufal, will inevitably draw
down upon this kingdom, hitherto Co flourifh
ing, new and more terrible disasters.
The part which the French nation may
take, in con'eauence of this declaration, will
either extinguifli or perpetuate the fatal ef
fects of calamitous war, by removing, in the
fuppreflion of royalty, the means of re edab
lifting and keeping up the ancient connexion
between France and the powers of Europe ;
or may open the way, by negociation, to the
restoration of peace, order and tranquility,
which those who call themselves the deposita
ries of the national will, are the mod interfil
ed to render as prompt as it is neccflary to
the kingdom. (Signed)

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WEDNESDAY, December 2s.
A bill providing for a reimhurfement,Â»fra }c*n
made of the Bank of the United States, was ta
ken into consideration. Mr. Steele moved that
the firft feAion be (truck out; this occasioned a
debate.
Mr. Steele said he made the motion, not that
he was opposed to the general object of the
bill, but on a persuasion of the bad policy oi
borrowing. He remarked, that with refpe&to
an individual it had been considered that he
was generally in the road to ruin, in proportion
to the facility with which he could borrow, and
the fame remark would probably apply to pubr
lie bodies. He had an aversion to the whole
fyllem of borrowing; he had therefore made
the motion in order to try the principle, how
far we were to proceed, and ia hope# that a
more full difcufiion of the would pro-
duce an abandoning of such a fyflem.
Mr. Madison enquired whether any informa
tion had been received ifÂ» consequence of the re
solution passed or\,Monday, directing the Secre
tary of theTreafury to report the date of the fo
reign loans.
The Speaker said, he supposed the time had
not admitted of any return from the Secretary.
Mr. Madison then said, he should bfc to
be informed what were the difadvamages whj*.h
would accrue from defering the bufiuefs a few
days. If it should appear that any lot's would oc
cur, or the credit of the government fuffer, he
should mod heartily agree to proceed in the
bill; but as it did not appear that this wis the
cafe, and much important information was want
ing, he hoped that no precipitation would take
place. .
Mr. Sedgwick replied to Mr. Madison; he
adverted to an exiding date of fa&s, in relation
to a sum of money now laying tifelefs, but ap
propriated for a fpccial purposeâhe observed,
that one objedt of the bill was for the govern
ment to avail itfelf of this sum, by making a
a loan at a less rate of intered than a now
paid to the Bank of the United States.â
The design, said Mr. Sedgwick, is not the
gentleman from North Carolina has said, to eÂ»-
crease the debts of the United States, bu&to di
minish those debts, and this has been the cafe in
refpeii to every loan that has been made since
the exidence of the present government.
Mr. Madison observed, that he had heard no
thing to induce him to suppose that any rtecefli
ty exided for a loan for the purpose of y the. hillâ
*It is dated that there is a sum of money laying
useless : he knew, he said, of no motives df deli
cacy or propriety which should prevent tfie ap
plication of this money to paying the loan made
of the Bank of the United States. If anV iuch
reasons existed, he was ignorant of thenl, and
therefore Ihouldbe glad of further information :
he supposed he was not alone in this refpeA ;
many of the members, he believed, were equal
ly in the dark with himfelf.
Mr. Baldwin, after adverting to the several
aAs authorising loans, inferred from their amount
their appropriations, and the surplus of thole
loans now on hand, that there was no neceflity
for a new loan to discharge the loan made of
the Bank of the United States.
Mr. Gerry gave an account of the several
loans, the obje&s to' which they are appropria
ted, and from this statement ftiewed that there
was no such surplus as the gentleman stated, to
be-applied to the present object without inter
fering with appropriations already made Mr.
Gerry observed, that the design of the bill was,
not to increase the debts of the United States,
it is simply to provide for diminilhlng'lhfe inte
rest now paid on a debt due from the govern
ment âThat this will be the operation of the
proposed loan was demonstrable; and (in this
principle the bill is moll extremely eligible.
Mr. Williamfon said he hadjnard one
substitute hinted at, for the fe&ion propfcfed to
be struck out ; and he fliould not vote for strik
ing out, for that. He fliewed that the felling of
the (lock in the Bank, belonging to the United
States, would have a most inauspicious effeAâ
It would fall into the hands of foreigners; he
could have wiftied rather that the United States
owned the whole of the ilock. He doubted
whether the government could, in juftijre and
found policy such a sale of flock as to- af
fe& the value of the property, as fubfcijiptions
from individuals arose in part from the govern
ment being interefled; it would operate some
thing like an ex poll fa&o law. He - added 1
some remarks, to Ihew that <no hnmediatb neces
sity exilled for a new loanâhe thought we
could do without one at present.
Mr. Madison replied to Mr. Williamfonâhe
remarked that this was the firft time |ie had
ever heard it intimated, that the property of the
United States, in the Bank, was unalienable â
with refpe'dl to the money appropriated, and
now laying useless, he was of opinion that it
ought immediately to be applied to the original
purpose, i.e. to pay our debt tp France. lie tho't
that now was the time to discharge our obliga
tions to that country ; and To far was he from
confulering the present poilure of affairs as a
reason tor withholding payment âhe could ra
ther wilh that the fumdue was wafted to them
on the wiÂ»gs of the wind. He added, that if
he was arguing from miflaken principles,, he
Vihed to be set right. But the reason for
| -withholding payment from our generous allies
-2 46-
ic did not thijik fufficient: the ittfori fuggeft
â d was that the United States, by paying the i
money at the present time, might be liable to
~y it again, in cale of change in the govern
ment of France. ..
Mr. Giles denied the necessity and the policy
of making a loan of two million of dollars, to
provide for the payment of an inftalmen
100,000 dollars to the Bank of the U btates
He {hewed by an induction of particulars, that
it was at lead extremely problematical whether
there would be any saving by a loan at J per
cent, when the charges and douceurs were taken
into the account. At least, said he, it wi re
quire a considerable time to elapse before the
profits talked of will begm to accruc. On the
whole, considering the imperfect ttateof the in
formation in possession of the House, receding
the loans already made, their amount and appli
cation,-he thought tfie business Ihould be post
poned : he therefore proposed a resolution, re
quiring from the Secretary of the Treasury, a
more particular statement of fads, refpeSmg all
foreign loans, than was required by the reiolu
tian of Monday. .
Mr. Findley obfervedâfrom the various sur
mises which had been made in the House, he
feared there was a general want of information,
in refped to the whole business; and therefore
was in favor of the bill's laying over till the re
quifite information was obtained. For his part,
he never would vote for the clause till this in
formation was received; and if the bill is not
postponed, he ihould vote for ftrikmg out the
feition. . ,
Mr. Boudinot remarked, that as the United
States need the sum now to be proviued for, and
were paying an interest at 6 per cent, the only
question was, whether we (hall borrow a sum
at S percent, to pay it off, and thereby make a
saving of 20,000 dollars annually, er continue
to pay the 6 per cent. He remarked, that the
only objeaion which had been mentioned, was
that which had been offered by the fefitfcmSn
from Virginia, that little or no saving would be
made, owing to the douceur, charges, &c.â
Mr. Boudinot said, that it must be understood,
that 5 per cent, includes the charges.
Mr. Fitzfimons observed, that the gentleman
who had brought forward the motion, had (aid
he did it to try the principle, whether we were I
to go on with the pernicious practice of loans.-â
Mr. Fitzfimons said he did not think that this
would try the principle. None of the loans
mad? by the present government have added to
the debt of the United States; they were all
made to discharge other loans, and have been
so applied to the great benefit of the Country â
and this is the objed of the loan nlw proposed
to be made.âMr Fitzfimons stated sundry par
ticulars, to shew that a loan at 5 per cent, would
in the present cafe be an annual saving to the
United States of 16,000 dollars per annum;
even calculating on the douceur, stated by the
gentleman from Virginia, which is the highest
that has ever been mentioned.âMr. Fitzfimons
added I'ome obserVations refpe&ing the neceility
of making immediate provision, as the<biftal
ment became due next week.
Mr. Madison adverted to the different grounds
on which the bill had been advocated; and now
the support was narrowed down to the firnple
idea of the exigency of making immediate pro
vision for the mflalment. He hoped, therefore,
that the bill would not be precipitated, but lay
on the table for further consideration.
Mr. Dayton opposed the bill's laying on the
table.
Mr. Steele offered sundry reasons to induce a
postponement. â¢
Mr. Venable observed, that according to the
statement which had been mentioned of the dou
ceur on foreign loans, the United States in the
firft iÂ»ftance would encreafe their debt by bor
rowing at- 5 percent, to pay off loans on-which
, 6 per cent, was now paid : it would require a
number of years to elapse before they would be
gin to realize any advantage; so that at this mo
ment the debt of the United States were in fad
encreafed by the loans already madeâand it
would take four years to place the country in
exaitly the fame ilate in which it now is, in re
lation to the loan of the Bank of the United
States, in cafe a foreign loan at 5 per cent, is
now made to pay the bank.
Some observations were made in opposition
to Mr. Venable, in which it was asserted that
the advantage of the proposed loan would be
gin immediately to accrue to the United States.
Mr. Steele's motion was at length determined
in the negative by ayes and noes, which are

MONDAY, Dec. 31,
Mr. B. Bourn presented the petition of the

Mr. Thatcher presented the petition of Isaiah
Thomas, Printer, of Worcester, in MafTachu
fetts, praying that the article of Printing Types
imported from Europe, may be exempted front
duty ; and that bonds given by the petitioned
for the duty on a large quantity of Types im
ported by him, may be cancelled. Read and
referred to the Secretary of the Treasury.
A bill to amend an aÂ«sl entitled, an a& for e
ftabling a mint, and regu'ating the coins of the
United States, so far as refpe&s the coinage of
copper ; reported by, Mr. Williamfon,read
twice, and referred to a committee of thef
whole for to-morrow.
The bill to ascertain the fees deman 'al)le on
cases of admiralty proceedings in the courts of
the UnitetlStates, &c. was brought in engrav
ed, read the third time, the blanks filled up. Qn
the queltion, Shall the bill pass ?
Mr. said the bill appeared to him
to be efientially defective ; one leg was cut
away, and it limped very badly on the other; he
wished therefore it (hould not pass. He wished
that the judiciary fyflem (hould be generally a
mended ; this uas the desire of his constituents,
who, under the regulations now existing were
exposed to innumerable difficulties; and with
relpe& to seizures, they had almost ceased, ow
ing to the perplexities thrown in the way, by
the regulations of the courts of the U. States.
Mr. W. Smith acknowledged that the bill
was not so good an one as he could have wished
â-he remarked that he could not conceive how
any thing could limp on one leg. But its mutl?
lated state, said he, may be attributed to the
gentleman who now opposes its passage. Mr.
Smith said, the gentleman had not, in his opini
on, give any fufficient reason against its pac-
ing. He further remarked, that it originated oft
a petition from upwards of 60 refpe&able mer
chants of the city of Charleston, who complain
ed of the enormous fees they were fubje& to in
that state. Their petition has been thought just
and reasonable. The hill will afford them re
lief, without doing injury to any other parts of
the union. He hoped, therefore, that the bill
might pass, as a temporary relief, until a gene
ral revision of the judiciary fvftem, (hall tal;e
place. No further observations being
the bill was passed.
The report of a feledl committee on the pe

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
SESSIOf) OF SATURDAY OCTOBER 20.
The Secretary read the following
Letter from the Commissioners to the Army
of the Centre,
At the Camp of Vaudoncourt, Odt, 18,
at ten o'clock in the evening, the
First year of the French Republic.
Citizens,
THF.divifion of the army commanded
by General Kellerman, arrived yesterday
at the Camp of Vaudoncourt: General
Valence, who commands the other divi
fioW, advanced through the sorest of Mau
l gienne, and puihed his van-guard a$ far
as Pillon, which he found occupied by
; the enemy. He was obliged to bring up
his cannon against this poit, and then he
soon got master of it.
The Duke of Brunfwick and General
Kalkreuth sent in that day a Trumpeter
with an Aid de Camp, to demand a per
sonal conference with General Kellerman;
they tefHfied a desire to accommodate
matters, but General Kellerman adhering
(tri&ly to the intentions of the national
convention, answered that he could en
ter into no conference whatever, as long
as the Prufiian army ftiould be on the ter
ritory of the French republic ; that the
re-surrender of Longwy was a prelimina
ry without which hg could enter into no
engagements. The Duke of Brunfwick
offered to evacuate Longwy and to give
the place up on the 26. Kellerman judg
ing that he wanted four days mote to ar
rive with his army before that place on
account of the roadS being broke so much
insisted on having the place evacuated the
22d of this month.
After this conference, General Valence
was charged with the regulation of the
articles of capitulation. We fend in
closed an authenticated copy thereof, ?nd
you will judge yourfelf of the advanta
ges of this event. On the 22d at teu
o'clock in the morning the enemy will
â¢ have quitted the territory of the Repub
lic. General Kellerman will march up
.-his whole army in battle array, and our
commilfioners will thank them for their
courage and perfeverence. We beg our
'fellow citizens to partake of the joy
which such an event hascaufed us.
See here then this contest of despotism
against liberty soon determined ; and
happy are we to have been the witnefles
thereof, and to be charged to give you
tbefe incerefting details.

The commissioners of the national
convention,
Further accounts by the late arrival at this port
-'from Dunkirk stateâThat Verdun and Longwy
were evacuated pursuant to articles of capitula-
tion by the Austrian and Pruflian arnvtcs, and
immediately taken pofleflion of by the French
forcesâfeveral other places were also abandoned
by the invading armies, and others taken by the
French after a faint resistanceâso that the enemy
were entirely driven out of FianceâNot only
so, but.the French armies had penetrated into
the Geiman Territories, had taken Spires,
Worms, Mayence and other placesâSpires and
Worms Jhad been laid under conti ibutions ;
from the latter a million of ltvres had been ex-
actedâ The siege of Lisle was raised, after hav

and swear thev will never again acknowledge a
king, or submit to any maftcr whateverâThe
people of Fvance are exceedingly elated with
their fuccefTesâ and consider their lofles by the
devastations and lieges of the enemy as nothing,
when contrasted with ;he favorable turn tn their
affairs, and the profpeft of a speedy and perma
nent < ffabliftiment of their Liberties under the
aufpiccs of a Free Republi^ âThe papers we
have fceo are to the 23d Oft. printed at Parisâ
thev contain no accounts of the prefcnt fituaiion
of M. lahFavett*, nor of the ci-devant King and
Queen ol France.âln Verdun a considerable
number of letters and papers were intercepted,
throwing great light on the hitherto secret ma
nceu\ res of the emigrants, and the other enemies
of the revolutionâM. Potion, in a speech to the
Convention, inform* them of a protest of the
ci-devant King against all the a6U and proceed
ings of the National Assembly, which he had
signedâa Hedging that he had not been in a state
of freedom to approve or not to approve those
aÂ£>s and proceedingsâThis protest had been
â¢. sent to several of the courts, particularly thai of
liruiTclU.â G neral Paoli is goiÂ«g on an expedi
tion against Sardinia.
By accounts published of the votes for
Vice President of the United States, it ap
pears, that exclusive of Kentuckyâthe num
bers are for Mr. Adams 77 âMr. Clinton 50
âMr. Burr I ; difference fev. Mr. Adams 26.
It is an old remark, li to preserve peace be
prepared for war"âbut modern patriots
preach a contrary do&rine ; so in politics,
they fay the way to preserve the u rights of
is to throw down every barrier of law
and justice that defends them.
Tiiofe who are fmcere in inculcating thi
ufefnlnefs of public lchools, as a means of dit
fufi'ng knowledge and preferring liberty, win
not stop at that point. They will feel the
fame ardor to promote a free ftftify into pub
lic measure", and a xhcap and icrt&in fciiculii
tion of new/papers. It will be in vain that the
people are, by education, enabled to judge of
their rulers,-if they watch not over their do
ings, or be not Jeafonably and fully informetl
thereof.
As we government, it teems, has gained ho
less than Onr million by granting a chaiter
worth no more than five million, would it not
be well to take a hint from the plan of the
bank, for difpofmg of the wclrcrn lands when
ever peace and a completion of n\\ privatefaUi
in that countfy will permit such a mealure to
be adopted. The territory (which is as much
the property of the public now, as the privi
lege veiled in the bank was prior to the char
ter) might be divided into 25,000 lots or
shares, and a grant be made of 20,000-, free
of all quit-rents and taxes, to an incorporated
company of such generous fubferibers as will
agree that the public may retain the remain
ing J,OOO. The better to ensure success to
the plan, by evincing the faith of those who
adopt it in its profitablenefs, it should be un
derstood that all members of the government
be free both in law and decency, to take the
lead in liberal fnbfcriptions for their private
emolument. It will be further expedient,
and tend to keep up a proper understanding
between the company and the government*
and to facilitate seasonable aids, benefits and
encouragements to the former, if members of
the government be not only interested as fub
feribers, but a suitable number be alwavs in
commiflron to manage and dircd. the affairs of
the company.
Onr fcrrbbiers caution the people to beware
of the writers who recommend order and obe
dience to the law. The writers who cry out
knave and rogue, they fay, are the people's
friends, and are to be confided in. What is
the amount of this ?âA scribbler who finds
any passion up, and falls in with it, is very
clever. Wherever there is a local prejudice,
he is very sincere, and shews himfelf a man <;f
truth by cowting it and making the moll of
it to obftru<st the law, and to discredit and
â¼ilify the servants of the public. But the
man that advises others to be calm, to for
bear violence against the excise law, to think
more favorably of government and of human
nature than our mobbocrats fay they deserve,
is held up as a fly seducer of the republican
virtue of our country. The way to cheat
our people, is not to oppose prejudice and
paflion. The ambitious man who would de*
ftroy liberty, must run with the multitude,
and run them out of breath. Liberty must
have no resting placeâit must have no (bel
ter. Thus exhausted and defeneelefs, it be
comes an easy prey, and this is what our
anarchy-men seem to be laboring to accom
plish. We have a fret government; yet that
will not please them. The next experiment
seems to be either to have none at all, or one
that is not free.

By advices from Cologne, dated the

the French General Cuftine, to pulh on
to Mayenee, Daimtladt, and Frankfort,
even to penetrate into the Hessian territo

Letters from Manheim positively ft ate
that an at my of from 25 to 30,000 Ruf
fians will be before Landau, by the com

that the firft column, conhfting of 6000
men, has already reached Bohemia.â
These troops will unquestionably be join
ed by the body of 25,000 Hungarians,
which is expedttd to reach the borders of
the Rhine within the above period.
By the above advices it appears that
the Princes of the Empire aie to furnilh
double contingencies, and that the King
of Pruflia has ordeied the levy of fredi
troops. In this cafe General Dumourier
has formed a very falfe opinion of the
sentiments of this monarch, whom, with
the whole of his army, he has sent back
- to Pruflia.
The disorder in the queen's feet is riot

The governors of the bank of England

At a meeting, called by tlie Lord
Mayor of Dublin, at the Exchange there,
on the loth inft. a proposal was made by
his lordftu'p, that some public means
