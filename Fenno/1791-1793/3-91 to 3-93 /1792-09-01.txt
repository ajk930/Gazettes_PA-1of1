FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
REPRESENTATIVES in CONGRESS.
THAT liberty depends on government for
its existence and preservation, is a senti
ment recognized by the Constitution of the
United States, by all our State constitution"-,
and by the National Allembly of France on fe
veral occasions ; this is as true in politxs as t
anv principle in the economy of nature ; it is
true in a more extensive sense than some t'leo
rifts appear ready to allowâfor while it is af
â¢erted that government depends on opinion, It
seems to be affuined by certain writers, that if
the public opinion was hoftiie to any form of go
vernment whatever, still liberty might be pre
served : Whereas civil liberty becomes extinct
t'ie moment that government is diflolvedâfur
in a state of natu^l',Ji r en â _th tilone is the supreme
dilator j and life freedoai and property are
held entirely at fuiferance.âLiberty then rot
only depends on government, but the perfec
tion of freedom is in proportion to the Jlrcngth
and permanency of government : A weak go
vernment is always fluctuating, its measures
are perpetually changingâconfidence is let a
floatâuncertainty fuccecd industry grows
d : 'cou-agcd, property recedes from an active
fp'iera ; distrust, indolence and a long train of
vices public and private succeed, and complete
the public disgrace, and the public m ferv. This
i-njtan exaggerated rep-efentation, it is a
tranfeript from real life ; we are but just ef
caoed from a fitnation which more t'>an juftifies
t'ie defciiption. Government founded on just
Ujid e ]ual principles is an exemplification of rc
pub'icanifmâ'uch a government every wife
people, favorably fitirjted, will adoptâand of
w'nic I, so long as they retain a virtuous and
confiltent character, nothing but superior ex
ternal force can dep ive them. The above re
marks are not offered as being new ; thev are
felf-evident principles, which cannot be con
troverted, they are written in the book of ex
perience ; every age, and every nation has
lorne teftnnonv to their immutability: But
what have these ob r ervation- to do with the bu
rners of electing Representatives in Congress ?
Much every way. They however have special
reference to sentiments which a.e advanced bv
foms person?, to e'feft sinister purposes at this
critical and important juncture. It is an old re
mark that mankind are prone to change ; this
propensity gives rife to inuumerable projects in
every puiTuit object and profeflionâfor an un
certain good always flatters more than positive
enjoyment. In every free country there are
always to be found men who are, or pretend to
be, dillatisfied with t'eexifting state of things J
hut were itnot for this mutability of disposition,
vhich such persons know how to avail them
elves of, the people, when happy, would remain
so, and forever fruftrate the machination* of
the enemies of their peace and freedom. At
t sis time various artifices are used to deceive
and div di the peopleâattempts have been
made to depreciate in their estimation, their
own governmentâand it is made a criterion of
patriotic worth and abilities, to condemn the
majority of those men whom the people have
e.efted in the si ft and second Congress, as a
â¢;roup of the vilest inifcreaiits that ever fold or
betrayed a country. Let not the free electors
be dece ved, "by their fr u ts ye (hall know
them"â" ;f thou dost well (halt thou not be ac
cents*!,." fai;l Satan to Job. That the general
government has done well, all our senses teftify
â >ur country is renovatedâ" Liberty has been
:hi ited round the globe"âTie has here found a
retting plact J but iftheavem.e to public fa
vo* is n\ :â  â  t.ie -urns of that glorious fabric, the
new conft.tution, and a fubverfionof those mea
sures which it ha '"anftioned ; liberty, difgnft
ed With a fickle age, will <juit t'<e ea rh for
ever. T,e re r a!t of wrhat ha? been said i<-, that
to aa honest mind, and an enl ghtenod under
standing,we ftould -e -juire, as indiipenfable qna
-1 ncations, principles of government consistent
with the pre ervat'nn of f-eedom, which will
tnOolye a decided attachment to the conftitu
ao.i oi tae United States. C.

No. IV,
" The FARMER"speaks of the state of tMnge
in France with as little accuracy, as he lhews
in regaid to Holland. He convevs the idea of
that kingdom being under raifcra'jl; cultivation
in refpedt to grain. Mr. Necke., however
allures uÂ«, t at they have not, fur fifty yeurs
past, imported more than one or'two bushel* i/l
the hundred of their consumption, and that 'hey
annually consume above i03,"j00,00j of lui/hel's
ot grain. This is confirmed by a French writ.*?
of eminence, who fays that Fr; nee p . di ces
three and a hali tJines the qusrtit of grailt
which was exported fume years ago fro.,. i_n
glanu, Poland, Dantzic, and the Nurt: , HoUandy
Sicily, Bai bary, ard the 'Archipelago. When
it is remembered that large quantities of grain
werS coniumed in France by their iinmenfe ar
my, their navy, the manufa&urers, and the cul*
tivators of the vine, and that there was a con
iidernbli? exportation to their colonie -, it will
appear, that farming in France cannot be on
so despicable a footing as he would have uÂ« to
believe. He ailerts further, in the 17th page,
that not only farming, but maiiufaflu:es alio,
were in a ruined state, in conlequence of* t: ft
measures of Lewis XIV. and of his Minifler
Lo/ieit. Here again, " The Farme*" is in a
great error ; fur, though it is well known tl at
the Fiench conlume an uncommon proportion
oi their own manufactures, and they hays <,wÂ»and one half times the people to supply at home
which t ie Britilh have, yet is was declared b;.
Mr. Necker,in 1784, that they constantly ship ;
surplus of manufafturc-., amounting to ont
hundred and fifty millions of livres in value pet
annum. These great eftablifhinents of niuiiu
faftures, founded much.more than thofc of En
gland or Holland 011 native produftibns,' are the
work of Ljeri, whom " The Farmer" holds
in so little eltimation. Had tie Miniiier adopt
ed the leading idea in the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury, that munujafhtref are prin
cipally 10 be de/itedand piomotcd, on account of the de
mand they occafimi Jor the yioduce of the tuitli
France, which respects his memory, would nave
hadreafon to blefs.h s name. All (olbert's er
rors aroTe from too strong a perception ot hail
the truth.
The principal causes of those evils which ex
isted in France before the late revolution were,
'the despotism, the extravagance, and the am
bition of their government, the inordinate di)-
tin&ions of mJn, contempt of the trading and
manufacturing citizen, local imposts and other
commercial errors, the inimeiife wealth of a
clergv, who could afford annual contributions
to the government, from their poflelltons, of
above i 0,000,000 of livres, religious perlUu
tions, a standing army of 212,000 men, ftlie
great expence of the marine, and, above all, a
system of taxation and revenue, through the
meani of the Farmers-General, extortionate,
anddeftruftive of the landed interest andlabori
oas poor.
Britain, which has tried the fyftein of direct
ing the internal induft-r? and flock of her citi
zens, by a<!ts of the legislature, in the most par
ticular detail, has carried manufactures to a
greater height than any ptv" nation, and has
a; much freedom in her go 'i i merit as fbe had
twenty or forty years ago. The evils of her
prcfent flatc are not of a natftre to
produced by the regulation of manufactures. â
Their public debt has been created, by their
efforts to fettle tfeeprefent family on the throne,
by wars on the continent of Europe, by the de
sire of naval superiority, arid, lafllv,
of the whole by a seven years war \yltli the
United State-, to maintain the fupre'Â«*acy of
their Parliament. But could they discharge
their public debt, eflablilh, on an equal footing,
all chriflian churches, and obtain an equal re
presentation in Parliament, few evils could be
inanifefted to have arisen from the interference
of their legislature with the business and flock
of their citizens.
" The Farmer," tells us, that Americans
are to be taught the leilon of freedom by the
French nation, and to be saved from ruin by
following their example. The people of the
United States, it is presumed, will dispute with
all other nations the honor of setting an illustri
ous example in the field of liberty, civil and re
ligious. In the theory and practice of free go
vernment, they surely are the firlt great mas
ters. Witness, Favctte, and Rochambcdu, and Hi.
Ton (Lauzun) and F)u Forfait, and A J oai//es 1 and the
lamented Gouiion, firfl the pupils of America,
and then the diftinguilhed champions of French
and European liberty. Witness, a truth, of
which no man can doubt, that every citizen of
France, who is not an aristocrat, would rejoice
to fee his country firmly and peaceably fettled
under such a government as that which we
enjoy.
So much for the errors of the leiTaris, which
u The Farmer" has extracted froiif his obser
vations on foreign countries. The . fubjeft of
another paper will be, the mistakes he has made ,
in regard to affairs at home.
ON REPRESENTATIojtI.
Extract from the Herald of Vprmont.
TT were a consummation devoutly to be
J. wished, that the true principle l ; of repre
sentation might be fairly difculfed in public, in
stead of the intereft<; and feelings of individuals.
It is very easy to discern the drift'of pretend
edly patriotic declaimers. Their views are
not public, but personal. X remember, when
the Judges of the County Courts were firft to be
appointed in this State, a certain would-be
Judge, in one of the counties, wasjafked, Who
â¢would be appointed Judges ?âhe rfadilv nomi
nated/our (there were to be five atjfhat time)
he could not name a man qualified for the fifth.
Being alked, If he would not himfelf accept the
appointment? he freely consentedâhut the
people did not approve the nomination. This
fame man would, 110 doubt, have thought, that
many of those who were nominated, were fit for
GovernorsâGeneralsâany thing, which did not
interfere with his present ambition."
EXTRACT.
" \J OTHING ought to be more weighed
i\ than the nature oi" books recommended
by public authority, So recommended, they
soon form tie character of the age. Uncertain
indeed is the efficacy, limited indeed is the ex
tent of a vi/tuous institution. But if educa
tion takes in vict as any part of its fvftem, there
is no doubt but that it will opc ite with abun
dant energy, and to an extent indefinite. Tie
magistrate, who in favor of freedom thinks
hiiAfelf obliged to fuffer all forts of publications
is under a ftrifter duty than any other, well to
conllder what fort of writers he (hall authorize
and (hall recommend by the strongest of all sanc
tions, that is, by the public honors and rewards.
He ought to be cautious how lie recommends
authors of mixed or ambiguous morality. He
ought to be fearful of putting into the hands of

DUNKIRK, June 16
The little army which was encamp
ed in this neighbourhood, confining
of jooo men, composed nearly of an
etjual number of regular troops and
national guards, under the command
of .Gen. Carl, and General Mouronen
feeond, marched this morning on the
Triad towards Lisle, attended by a
train of artillery, for the declared
pUrpose of joining the Grand Army
under the command of Gen'rls Luclt-
r and La Fayette
/ [ he Citizens of Dunkirk had been
previously fuminoned, and ordered
ro furnifh all their horses for the use
Gen
of the artillery and baggage waggons,
with alacrity was accordingly
done : Ample rellitution however
will be made by the Nation, to every
individual who fultains any lols or
damage by the accommodation.
Much cannot be said in favor of
lie discipline of the Troops, or their
military afpetff ; but they declare
that their deficiencies in these re
fpecfts (hall be made up by personal
valor.
It was apprehended, that the army
of Dunkirk was destined for the cap
ture ofOHend ; but (uch an attempt
*ou 1 d have only proved the want of
ifi formation, or a frivolous gasconade,
as half a dozen men, with a single
cannon, would obtain the surrender
of that town : all the military stores
and other properly lately there, be
longing to the Auflrian government,
having been removed, and the place
consigned to whatever military force
might chufe to attack it. No opposi
tion-, therefore, would be attempted,
farther than (hutting the gates, and
openin g them again,wii h a surrender
of the keys,on their beingdenianded.
The port is now free to traders of
every nation, and the property of
ihe merchants and individuals is and
will be held sacred. The fact is, ilie
French do not think that place worth
taking, which the Auftrians do not
think worth defending.
The maritime commerce of each
country will meet with equal protec

of war are Rationed off Ollend, and
other (hips of force are cruising in

The particulars of the siege of Seringapatam,

Of all games that of ruling is the most be
witching ; the lookers on are not the lealt in
terdict'.âthey feel all the palftons of thole who
play % t he hand, belides a burning impatience to
take their places. Accordingly experience aÂ£id
our knowledge of men, will convince us that
power is the real object of all parties, and li*
berty the pretence of all uniucceisful ones -
America in the infancy of its government dis
plays the monster, party, arrived to its lull
growth. Many who hear of a party combined
for the purpose of seizing the power of govern
ment, feein furpriled at the tact. Thole who
turn to other countries and to human nature
for light, would be more furpriled if it were
not so ; the style of a cei tain Gazette affords
the molt undoubted evidence. Happily for the
cause of good order, this fattion labors to little
purpose ; the state of things is against then:â
lfcill however, they ft:ck to their work J with
them, a good law was paffcd to effedt ionie bad
end. Public faith is kept to produce a corrupt
influence : Manufactures are favored by pro
tecting duties to promote the schemes of op
preflion, and of the Southern interest ; the Foit-
Office is made auxiliary to the circulation Â©f
the newspapers, for the fake of flopping infor
mation, and keeping the people ip ignorance.
There is 110 land taxâbut tlie landholders are
ruined by a government that does not touch
them with its little finger. The bank, it is
true, is favorable to trade, to manufactures
and to the collection of the revenueâand mo
ney is become more plenty ; but all this, is a
wicked plot to raile up a moiued influence, and
to promote lpeculation. Nothing can be more
provoking to a party, than the luccefs of the
measures of a government which they wish to
govern ; while things go well, the old lervants
of the people will do. In such a bad cafe, bad
motives mull be afligned by the party, for good
aCtions, and imaginary dangers must be hitched
on to prosperous events. In time, some lucky
public misfortune or blunder may happen, and
then those who always prophecy evil, may exult
and cry, we told you so.
