" Patrum interim animos, certamen regni, ac cupido verfibat."
two armies met in Burgundyâbut the Piinces, being in-
X ferior, evaded an engagement.
The Queen Mother, in 1570, had too much penetration not to
unravel the manoeuvres of the Marftials de Cofle and Damville.
She informed the King of them, and pcrfuaded him to listen to
pronofitions of accommodation. She perceived that the paflions
and the perfidy of these grandees, might throw the (late into the
greatest dangers, if the war was continued. She was still more de
termined by the news which (he received from Germany, where
the Prince Cafimir began to raise troops in favor of the Hugonots.
The finances were exhausted to such a degree, that they knew not
where to find funds to pay the Swiss and Italian troops, to whom
they owed large arrears. In short, they wished for peace; and
were weary of a war which held all men's minds in perpetual
alarms, which reduced a great part of the people to beggary, and
which cost the date so many men, and so much money. The
King held, with the Queen Mother, the Duke of Anjou, and the
Cardinal of Lorraine, councils, in which they rcfolved to return
to the projett, already so many times formed and abandoned to
grant peace to the Hugonotsâto deliver the kingdom from joreign troops,
and finally to employ artifice, and take advantage of favorable conjunc
tures âto take off the chiefs of the party, which they thought would yield
oj itjef infallibly, as soon ai it fhouldfee itfelf deprived of the support
of its leaders. It was thus, that the court would have substituted
craft instead of force, to execute a design, which the obstinacy of
the Hugonots, or the want of fidelity in those who commanded
armies, had always defeated whenrccourfe had been only to arms,
With such dark and horrid views were overtures of peace made,
and conditions concluded. The Princes and Admiral, still diffi
dent and diftruftful, retire to Rochellc. The Kiug
gain their confidence. To this end, he proposes to give his filter
Marguerite in marriage, to the Prince of Navarre, and to make
war in Flanders upon the Spaniards. The marriage is resolved on,
and all the Chiefs ot rhe Hugonots come to Court. The Queen of
Navarre is poifoncd. After her death the marriage is celebrated,
dur : ng the fealts of which, Admiral Coligni is wounded by an af
faflin. The King takes the resolution that, as in extreme cases it is
imprudence to do things by halves, the Hugonots should be exter
minated. The night between the 23d and the 24th of August,
1572, a Sunday called Saint Bartholomew's Day, the Admiral is
maflacred, and almost all the other Calvinifts are cut in picces in
Paris, and in several other cities of the kingdom.
Such, in nations where there is not a fixed and known consti
tution, or where there is a constitution, without an effe&ua! ba
lance, arc the tragical effe&s of emulation, jealousies and rivalries
deftruftion to all the leadersâpoverty, beggary and ruin to the
followers. France, after a century of such horrors, found no re
medy against them but in absolute monarchy : noi did anv nation
ever find any remedy against the miseries of such rivalries among
the gentlemen, but in despotism, monarchy, or a balanced consti
tution. It is not necelTary to fay, that every despotism and mo
narchy that ever has existed among men, arose out of such emula
tions among the principal men ; but it may be aflerted with con
fidence, that this cause alone is fufficient to account for the rife
progress and establishment of every despotism and monarchy in
the four quarters of the globe.
It is not intended at this time to pursue any further this inflic
tive though melancholy history, nor to make any comparisons, in
detail, between the state of France in 1791, and the condition it
was in two or three centuries ago. But if there are now differen
ces of opinion in religion, morals, government and philosophy
if there are parties and leaders of partiesâif there are emulations
if there are rivalries and rivalsâis there any better provision made
by the constitution to balance them now than formerly ? If there
is not, what is the reason ? who is the cause ? All the thunders of
heaven, although a Paratonnere had never been invented, would
not in a thousand vears have destroyed so many lives, nor otca
fionrd so much desolation among mankind, as the majority of a
legislature in one uncontrouled aflembly may produce in a single
Saint Bartholomew's Day. Saint Bartholomew's Davs arc the na
tural, neceflary and unavoidable effect and consequence of diversi
ties in opinion, the spirit of party, unchecked passions, emulation
and rivalry, where there is not a power always ready aud inclined
to throw weights into the lightest scale, to preserve or restore the
equilibrium.
With a view of vindicating republics, commonwealths and free
States, from unmerited reproaches, we have detailed these anec
dotes from the history of France. With equal propriety we
might have resorted to the history of England, which is full of
contefls and diffeniions of the fame fort. There is a morsel of
that history, the life and attions of the prote&or Somerset, so re
markably apposite, that it would be worth while to relate itâfor
the prcfent however it mull be waved. It is too faftiionable with
writers to impute such contentions to republican governments, as
if they were peculiar to them ; whereas nothing is further from
reality. Republican writers themselves have been as often guilty
of this mistake, in whom it is an indiscretion, as monarchical
"writers, in whom it may be thought policy ; in both however it
isanerror. W? shall mention only two, Machiavel and deLolme.
In Machiavel's history of Florence, lib. 3, we read " It is given
| from above that in all republics, there should be fatal families,
, are born for the ruin of them ; to the end that in human
affairs nothing should be perpetual or quiet."
indeed this were acknowledged to be the will of heaven, as
chiavel seems to afTert, why should we entertain resentments
against such families ? They are but inflruments, and they cannot
ut answer their end. If they are commiflioned from above to
4l e angels, why should we oppose or resist them ! As to
the end" there are other caufcs enough, which will forever pre
vent perpetuity or tranquility, in any great degree in human af
'airs* Animal life is a chemical process ; and is carried on by
unceasing motion. Our bodies and minds, like the heavens the

trary they are rent to be blessings - and they are blessings, until bv
T.T'r u "â¢ tt ' lgn Â° ratlCe and im P r "dence, in refuting to ef
tabliffi such inftituttons as will make them aUays blessings, we
â  urn t hem into cutfes. There are evils it is true which attend them
ts well as all other human blessings, even government, liberty, vir
tue and relig-.on. It is the province of philosophy and policy to
increase the good and lcffcn the evil that attends them as much as
poHiole. But it is not surely the way, either to encreafe the good
or ltiien the evil which accompanies such families, to represent
chem to the people as machines, as rods, as scourges, as blind and
mechanical instruments in the hands of divine vengeance, un
mixed with benevolence. Nor has it any good tendency or el
a to endeavor . to render them unpopular ; to make them ob
jects of hatred, malice, jeaioufy, envy or revenge, to the common
people. The way ol wisdom to happiness is to make mankind
more friendly to each other. The existence of such men or fami
lies is not their fault. They created not themselves. We, the
Plebeians, find them the workmanfliip of God and i.ature like
ourselves. The constitution of nature and the course of provi
dence has produced them as well as us : and they and we must live
ogether; it depends upon ourselves indeed whether it {hall be in
peace, love and friendlhip, or in war and hatred. Nor are they
reasonably the objetts of censure or averfiou. of resentment, envy
or hatred, for the gifts of fortune, any more than for those of na
ture. Conspicuous birth is no more in a man's power to avoid,
than to obtain. Hereditary riches are no more a reproach than
they are a merit. A paternal estate is neither a virtue Â»ior i fault.
He must nevertheless be a novice in this world who does not know
that these gifts ot fortune, are advantages in society and life, which
confer influence, popularity and power. The diftin&ion that is
made between the gifts of nature and those of fortune appears to
be not well founded. It is fortune which confers beauty and
strength, which aie called qualities of nature as much as birth
and hereditary wealth, which are called accidents of fortune :
and on the other hand it is nature which confers these favors, as
really as stature and agility.

[Continued from our last.]
IF a man has power over me, and aperfon con
vinces me that he is my adversary, his power
immediately becomes an object of fear : Fear
speedily becomes hatred, and I am incited to de
flroy the power, which so disturbs me. The
power of a good government is naturally an ob
ject of love and admiration. Every man confid
ing in the benevolent disposition of his rulers,
considers their power as his ownâand we consi
der our own power with great complacency and
regard. But when a state legillature palles a cen
sure upon Congress, how does it operate upon
men's opinions ? The citizen may fay, this As
sembly has power over my life and property â
it decides on other laws wifely, and without be
ing disobeyedâwhy fliould it be less competent
to decide on this law, which it has called a bad
one, than upon other occasions : Those who make
bad laws, and attempt to subvert liberty, are cer
tainly very bad men, and very unfit to hold the
reins of authority any longer.
What sentiments will succeed thefeimpreffions ?
Those who nnderftand human nature will fay,
this man will fear and hate the government, and
as soon as he thinks he has malecontents enough
on his fide to support him, he will despise and
disobey it. But what if this appeal to his passions
fliould be made at the moment when a law, in
dispensably neceflary to the union, but highly
obnoxious to the fears and prejudices of the peo
ple, is going into operation ! If the gunpowder
fliould not happen to take fire, we are not to
thank those for our escape who throw firebrands.
What renders this pratfiice of States remon
strating against the laws of the union peculiarly
delicate is, the nature of our confederationâone
government over many governments : What can
keep them from interfering, bnt their mutually
(hunning one another's walks. But if they will
take up in one house the bufinefsof another, and
decide it in opposition to Congress, one of two
things will take placeâeither the censure will
have no effect, and be disregarded, which by
abating the dignity and refpetftability of the
censuring body, is an injury to the cause of good
government, and brings it into contempt : Or if
it has any effect, it must be to the prejudice of
the body censuredâmaking it appear ignorant
or ill-intentior.edâdeftroying men's confidence
in it, and of course abating the influence of the
laws : This effei-T: is perniciousâbut it is infinite
ly worse in violent party times ; for when a state
ranges itfelf on the fide of one party, and fulmi
nates censures against the other, the dignity of a
great body-politic gives the contest the afpecft of
a national quarrel. In this ltate of things, the
address of a few bad men, and the violence of
many weak ones, may push it to the decision of
thefword, which usually arbitrates between an
gry societies. Let the candid and discerning
lovers of peace and good order weigh this ten
dency of our affairs. Every free man has his
weight with our elective government; leave him

TUESDAY, Feb. 8.
The BANK BILL under confdtration,
MR. MADISON
OBSERVED, that the present is a question
which ought to be conducted with modera
tion and candorâand therefore there is no oc
casion to have recourse to those tragic represen
tations, which have been adducedâ warmth and
passion fliould be excluded from the discussion of
a fubjeft, which ought to depend on the cool dic
tates of reason for its decision.
Adverting to the observation of Mr. Smith,
(S. C.) " that it would be a deplorable thing for
the Senate of the United States to have fallen on
a decision which violates the conflitut ion," he
enquired, What does the reasoning of the gen
tleman tend to ihew but this, that from refpett
tothe Senate, this house ought to fanftion their
decisions ? And from hence it will follow, that
the President of the United States ought, out of
refpecft to both, to fanifiion their joint proceed
ings ; but he could, he said, remind the gentle
man, of his holding different sentiments 011 ano
ther occasion.
Mr. Maaifon then enlarged on the exa<ft bal
lance or equipoise contemplated by the conftitu
tion,to be observed and maintained between the
several branches of governmentâand shewed,
that except this idea was preserved, the advanta
ges of different independent branches would be
loft, and their separate deliberations and deter
minations were intirely useless.
In describing a corporation he observed, that
the powers proposed to be given, are such, as do
not exist antecedent to the existence of the cor
poration ; these powers are very extensive in
their nature, and to which a principle of perpe
tuity maybe annexed.
He waved a reply to Mr. Vining's observations
on the common law, [in which that gentleman
had been lengthy and minute, in order to inva
lidate Mr. Madison's objection to the power pro
posed to be given to the Bank, toinake rules ancl
regulations, not contrary to law.] Mr. Madil'on
said the question would involve a very lengthy
discussionâand other objects more intimately
connected with the fubject,remained to be confi-
dered
The power of granting Charters, he observed,
is a great and important power, and ought not
to be exercised, without we find ourselves ex
pressly authorised to grant them : Here he dila
ted on the great and extensive influence that in
corporated societies had on public affairs in Eu
rope : They are a powerful machine, which have
always been found competent to effecfi objects on
principles, in a great measure independent of
the people.
He argued against the influence of the prece
dent to be established by the billâfor tho it has
been said that the charter is to be granted only
for a term of years, yet he contended, that grant
ing the powers on any principle, is granting them
in psrpetuum âand afluining this right on the part
of the government involves the afliimption of
every power whatever,
Noticing the arguments in favor of the bill,
he said, it had been observed, that " govern
ment neceflarily pofl'efles every power,"âHow
ever true this idea may be in theory, he denied
that it applied to the government of the United
States.
Here he read the reftritfive clause in the Con
stitutionâand then observed that he saw 110 pass
over this limit.
The preamble to the Conftiturion, said lie, lias
produced a new mine of power ; but this is thefirft instance he had heard of, in which the pream
ble has b#en adduced tor futlia purpose. In Ins
opinion the preamble only Itates tue objects ol
the confederation, and the fubfequeut clauses de.
.;;.-nate the exprefj powers by which tliofe objects
are'to be obtaine.i and a mean i-> proposed thro
which to acquire t})ofe ihat may be lound Itiil re
quiiuo, more fully to effect the purposes of the
confederation.
It is faiJ, " there is a field of legislation yet
urn :plored," âHe had often heard this language
but he confefled lie did not underltand it.âls
fhcre, laid he, a fmgie blade of grafsâls there
â any property in exiltence in the United States,
which is not fulijeit to legislation, either of the
particular States, or of the United States ? He
contended that the exercise of this power 011 the
part of the United States, involves, to all intents
and purposes, every power which an individual
Hate may exercise. On this principle he denied
the l ight of Congress to make use of a Bank to
facilitate the collection oi taxes. He did not,
however admit the idea,that the inftitutioii would
conduce to that objec r t : The bank notes are to
be equal to gold and silver, and consequently
will be as diiHcult to obtain as the specie. By
jneans of the objetfis of trade on which gold and
silver are employed, there will be an influx of
those articlesâhut paper being fubltituted, will
fill those channels, which would otherwise be oc
cupied by the precious metalsâThis, experience
lhews is the uniform effedt of such a fubltitution.
The right of Congress to regulate trade, is ad
duced as an argument in favor of this ofcreating
a corporation âbut what has this bill to do with
trade ? Would any plain man suppose that this
bill had any thing to do with trade ?
Hp noticed the observation refpecfung the uti
lity of Banks to aid the government with loans
.âHe denied the necessity of the institution to aid
the government in this refpecftâGreat Britain,
he observed, did not depend on such institutions
âlhe borrows from various sources.
" Banks it is said, are to pay the in
terest of the public debt," âthen they ought to
be established in the places where that inteieft
is paidâbut can any man fay, that the bank notes
will circulate at par in Georgia. From the ex
example of Scotland we know that they cannot
be made equal to specie, remote from the place,
where ihey can be immediately converted into
coinâthey mutt depreciate in cafe of a demand
for specieâami if there is no moral certainty
that the intei elb can be paid by these bank bills,
â will the government be juflified in depriving it
felf of the power of ettablifliing banks in differ
ent parts of the union ?
We reason (laid he) and often with advantage
xVom Britifti models, but in the present instance
there is a great dissimilarity of circumstances.
The bank notes of Great-Britain do not circulate
â universally ; to make the circumttances parallel,
it ought to have been afl'umedasa fac f t that banks
are elVablifhed in various parts of Great-Britain,
at which the interest of the national debt is paid
âbut the faift is, it is only paid in one place.
The clause of the conititution which has been
so often recurred to, and which empowers Con
gress to dispose of its property, he fuppoled re
ferred only to the property lefc at the conclusion
of the war, and has no reference to the monied
property of the United States.
The clause which empowers Congress to pass
all laws necessary, &c. has been brought forward
repeatedly by the advocates of the bill ; he no
ticed the several conllruiTtionsof this clause which
had been offered ; the conclusion which he drew
from the commentary of the gentleman from
Maflachufetts, Mr. Gerry, was that Congress may
do what they pleaseâand recurring to the opin
ion of that gentleman in 1787 ; he said the pow
ers of the constitution were then dark, inexpli
cable and dangerousâbut now, perhaps as the
result of experience they are clear and luminous !
The conftructions'of the constitution, he avert
ed, which have been maintained on this occasion
go to the subversion of every power whatever in
the several Statesâbut we are told for our com
fort that the judges will recftify our mistakes ;
how are the judges to determine in the cafe ;
are they to be guided in their deciiions by the
rules of expediency ?
It has been alked that if those minute powers
of the constitution were thought to be neceflary,
is it fuppofable that the great and important pow
er on the table was not intended to be given ?
Mr. Madison interpreted this circumstance in a
quite different way, viz. il" it was thought lie
ceflary to fpecify in rhe constitution, those mi
jiure powers, it would follow that more impor
tant powers would nave been â  explicitly granted
had they been contemplated.
Tlie Western Territory business he observed,
was a cafe J'ui generis, and therefore cannot be
cited with propriety : Well Point, so often men
tionetl he laid, was purchased by the United
States pursuant to lawâand the consent of the
Stare of New York is fuppo'ed, if it has not been
exp efsly gi anted ; but on any occasion does it
follow that one violation of the coujftitution is to
be juftified by another ?
The permanent residence bill, conceived
Was entirely irrelative to the fabjecl ; but lie
conceived it might be jultified on truly conlh
tutional principles. .
The act veiling in the Piefident of the Lnited
States ilie power of removability has been quo
ted ; he recapitulated in a few words his ica
lons for being in favor of that bill.
The bank of North-America, he said, he had
opposed, as he conlidered the institution as a vio
lation of the confederation. The State of Mas
sachusetts he recollected voted with him on that
occasion. The bank of North America was how
ever the child of necelfityâas soon as tlie war
was over, it ceased to operate as to continental
purposes. But, asked he, are precedents in war,
tojultify violations of private and Stare rights,
in a time of peace ? and did the United States
pass laws to punifti the counterfeiting the noles
of that bank ! They did nor, being convinced of
the invalidity of any such lawâthe bank there
fore took flielter under the authority of the State.
The energetic adniiniltratioii of this govern
ment is said co be connected withthisinlhtution.
Mr. Madison here stated the principles on which
he conceived this government ought to be ad
ministeredâand added, other gentlemen may
have had other ideas on the fubjetft, and may
have consented to the ratification of the conflitu
tioh on different principles and expectationsâ
but he considered the enlightened opinion and
affection of the people, the only solid basis tor
the support of this government.
Mr. Madison then stated his objections to the
several parts of the bill : '( he firft article he ob
jected to, was the durationâA period of twenty
years, he observed, was to this ccuiury as a per
iod of a century in thehiftoryof other countries
âthere was no calculating for the events which
might take place : He urged the ill-policy of
granting so long a term, from the experience of
the government in refpecft to some treaties, which
tho found inconvenient, could not now be altered.
The different claffesof the public creditors, he
observed, were not all put on an equal footing
by thii bill ; but in the bill for the disposal of
the Western Territory, this had been thought
eflential : The holders of 6 per cent, securities,
will derive undue advantagesâCreditors at adif
tance, and the holders of 3 per cent, securities,
ought to be consideredâas the public good is most
elfentially promoted by an equal attention to the
interest of all.
I admit, said he, that the government ought
to consider itfelf as the trustee of the public on
this occasion, and therefore should avail itfelf of
the best disposition of the public property.
In this view of the fubjedi, he objected to the
bill, as the public, he thought, ought to derive
greater advantages from the inftirution than
those proposed. In cafe of a universal circula
tion of the notes of the proposed bank, the pro
fits will be so great that the government ought
to receive a very considerable sum for granting
the charter.
There are other defects in the bill, which ren
der it proper and necell'ary in my opinion, that
it Ihould undergo a revision and amendment be
fore it passes into a law : The power vested by
the bill in the executive to borrow of the bank,
he thought was objecftionableâand the right to
establish subordinate banks, he said, ought not
to be delegated to any fee of men under heaven.
The public opinion has been mentioned : If
the appeal to the public opinion is suggested
with sincerity, we ought to let our constituents
have an opportunity to form an opinion 011 the
fubjedi.
He concluded by faying, he ftiould move for the
previous question.
The previous question, " Shall the main ques
tion now b: put," being determined in the affir-
mauve,
Mr. Gerry rose to reply to Mr. Madisonâbut
the house discovering an impatience to have the
main question put âafter a few remarks, he wa
ved any further observations.

Motion of Mr. Burke in the Hoafe of Commons, Feb-

" That in consideration of the long period of
time elapsed in the trial of Warren Hastings,
Esq. it is now neceflary for the obtaining of
speedy judgment, to carry up 110 further charges
except l'uch as relate to bribes, pensions, and pre
sents."
Mr. Fox seconded the motion.
Several amendments being moved and ne S 3 '
tived, Mr. Burke's motion was put and carries
without a division.
After Mr. Burke's original motion was putaiia
carried, the following were also carried :
Resolved, That a Meflage befent to the Lords,
to acquaint their Lordlhips that this House i*
ready to proceed upon the impeachment of War

now depending before the Lords in parliament
and to requelt that their Lordships will appoint
a convenient day for the further hearing of the
fame. ~

Me flags.HOUSE OF LORDS, Feb. 16
Yesterday Mr. Burke, attended by Mr. Pitt,
Jklr. Fox, and a great number of Members, pre
sented at the bar the following mellage.
" My Lords,
" I am ordered by the Commons to acquaint
vonr Lordfliips, that the House of Commons is
ready to proceed upon the impeachment of War
ren Mailings, Esq. late Governer General of
Bengal, now depending before your Lordfliips,
whenever your Lordfliips will appoint a conve
nient day for hearing of the fame."
Lord Grenville some (iiort time after rose, and
having observed, the very great importance of
the meflage which had been brought from the
commons, atul which in his opinion required
their Lordfliips moll serious consideration : 111
order that the House might profit by the experi
ence and wisdom of their ancestors, Lord Gren
ville moved,
" That a committee be appointed to fearcli for
Precedents relative to the Hate of the Impeach
ment of Warren Haltings, Esq. brought up by
the Commons, and proceeded upon in the ]ast
Seflion of Parliament, and to report their opin
ion to the House."
The fame was, upon the question put, agreed
to, several Lords present were named, and all
the Lords who have been present this Session
were ordered to be upon the said Committee.
There was a wicked time, in the history of
this country, when a inan might lose his heart
in the crofting of a street. The good-natured dif
fidence of the preferit day relieves him from that
danger, unless he can fix his eyes to a pair of
legs, or fall in love with a curtain. As to eyes,
teeth, and other ingredients of beauty, he has no
more to apprehend from them, than if we were
a nation of Spaniards ; anditisfaid, " what the
eye don't fee, the heart will seldom feel."
The mode of attack, both in war and in love
is fubjetft to alterations and improvements. The
ladies who formerly conquered by the eyes, now
hide them behind a curtain, and present their
irrefiftable beauty of short petticoats and neat an
cles. This tranlition from one extreme to ano
ther, we cannot approveâMedio tutiffimus !
The damages occasioned by the fire at the Al
bion mills are estimated at 200,0001. independ
ently of any delay in business, &c. The infu
rancesmade at the several offices are dated as not
exceeding half that amount !
FRANKFORT, Feb. i>-
A few of the Turkifti provinces in the poflef
fion oftheÃulfian troops, will furnifli them with
the means of adding conquest to conquest, till the
Empress, like a female Colofl'us, letting one foot
on Asia, and the other in Europe, and grasping
the isles in her hand, will aflame the daring pre
rogative of giving law to the world.
These things ought not to be.
NEW-LONDON, April i.
ExtraÃ of a letter from a foreign corrsfpondent, to
the Editors of this paper, dated Jan. 21, 1791.
[Concluded from our lalt.]
" The good crops in the United States, and
in Europe, will make provisions so cheap, that
many of your farmers, I prefunie, will feel the
neceflity of cultivating a greater quantity of flax
and hemp this year. Providence seems to call
â upon you, with a loud voice, to encourage and
promote manufactures. And perhaps this voice
will be even louder a few years hence than it is
at present. The political revolution in France
will probably bring on a revolution in the agri
tulture of that country. The dnke of Orleans
has begun the English mode of farming, on one
of his own eflates, with English farmers. The
abolition of the Corvee, and of every other part
of the feudal system, will remove that load of
disgrace which has hung so heavily on the French
fanners, and will inspire them with new life
and vigor. They will plant a much greater
quantity of land, and improve their land like
the English, and probably supply themselves en
tirely with wheat ; except when their crops may
fail, as in England, through unfavorable seasons.
Where then will your planters find markets for
their wheat, unless they can find them at home,
111 your manufatfluring and trading towns ? I
wi(h to fee the farmer well rewarded for his in
dustry and ingenuity. Nothing will effect this
10 much as a great increase in the population,
confiding of these who are not employed 111 agri
culture. The manufadtut es of your own coun
try will require a great quantity of raw materi
als, iuch as wool, flax, hemp, silk, cotton, hops
and barley for breweries, hides and bark to tan
them ; iron, lead, copper, &c. Thus the farmer
will have opportunity to vary his crops, and to
ra 'ii thrive best 011 his foil, aud what
Wl << ra t Â® le g reate st profit.
Manufactures more than double and treble
1 e v aJue of raw materials. Some of thein aug
f'lj' t '? e ' r va ' ue 20, some 50, and some an 100
" rt. So much do the goods you manufacture
8 to the wealth of your country. Moreover,
1 e wea hh will not only be great, but general,
without making many individuals too rich and
luxurious ; and therefore is the molt valuable
kind of wealth. Besides, they who carry on ma
nufactures run little or no l illv of being ruined,
except by their own imprudence. Whereas,
merchants mult venture much more, and some
of them may be ruined in spite of all their pru
dence and attention, while others are known to
acquire great wealth, and thereby promote lu
xury and dissipation, thebaneof morals, and the
ruin of empires.
I am pleased with the rapid increase of ma
nufactures in the United States, from moral as
well as political considerations , they afford relief
to a number of poor industrious people, who
ought not to fuffer for want, while they are wil
ling to work;âthey train up children in the habit
of industry, and thereby Secure them from the
vices ot idleness ;âand they have a tendency
toi reclaim lome who have contracted an idle ha
bit, and yielded to the temptations of vice, and
will leave them without excuse if they continue
therein, or run to extremes. In this connection
1 may obfeive the folitaiy confinement of cri
minals, and the hard labour to which they are
kept, by the new method lately adopted, will at
once promote manufactures, and thereby make
them ufeful members of society while they are
confined, and bring them into the habit of in
dultry, and give them time lor serious reflection,
and at the fame time put it out of the pjwer of
all to corrupt, or be corrupted by one another."
