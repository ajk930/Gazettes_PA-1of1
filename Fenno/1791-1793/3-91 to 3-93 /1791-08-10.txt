PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 69, HIGH STREET, BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD STREETS, PHII.ADEI.PHIA
[No. 30, of Vol. lII.]
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FENNO,
A" Friend to Justice" has thought proper to
come forward in your Gazette of the 30th
ulc. in a publication which it is well for hini is
not very long. The ignorance and pivfumpiion
which it displays, had otherwise precluded it ad
mission into your paper.
He appears to think that the people of Ame
rica will " read and judge" for tlitmfelves. in
this he is right. As one of the people, 1 read and
judge for myfelf; and I ihall make 110 ft ruple to
declare, that when I read this author's piece, 1
judged it to be the produtftion of some petty fcrib
bier (fiich as he characterizes Publicola's oppo
nents, of which, for aught I know, he may be out'
who comes forward in ilie papers " merely io
bring himfelf into notice." Let the good people
of America pay no attention therefore to a per
formance written with fncli contemptible views.
The author's vanity is fufiiciently gratified by
feeing his piece in print; and his end in writing
it is accoinplillied. He did not write from prin
ciple, as an honest man and patriot would do,
nor did he care how he bewildered his count) v
men, by his rash and afle: lions 0:1 10
important a fubjedt. U
The " Friend to to fay, that
the Vice-President is not the author of the pieces
fubferibed " Publicola." This may be true ; but
1 believe the " Friend to Justice" knows no more
whether the Vice-President wrote them, than the
people of Greenland doânotwirhltanding om
author has the " best authority" for what he
fays. The dignity of truth has often been vio
lated, by those who had the " best authority"
for doing i:.
â  Our bold author -mill also venture to assert, thai
" there is not a sentiment in the writings of Pub-
licola which can juftify the charges of aristo
cracy made against him, or in ihe smallest de
gree infringe the liberties of the people." This
aflertion ueed only be pointed out, that lis falfe
liood may be exposed and reprobated. The writ
ing' of " Publicola" are " ariftoci atical" in the
"â highest degree, and would be extremely dniige
rous, did not " the good sense of the people of
this country enable them to judge" and discern
their pernicious tendency. Very likciy the
" Friend to Justice" may have only funply erreJ
here ; for I do not believe that he knows what
the term " aristocracy" meatH.
" Publicola" is likely to meet.with his deserts ;
nor can the feeble " Friend to Jultice" rescue
him from the â¢' stings" which evil acftions leave
behind them.
Let me amicably part with the " Friend to
Justice," and advise him never more to take up
iiis pen, until he underflands his fubjc<stânever
â wantonly to write for his own arauftment, but al
ways to write on the fide of truth, and with a
view to benefit his country. By pursuing this
condnrt, he will gain the approbation of the
publicâhe will gain what is infinitely more de
licious an enjoyment, the approbation of his own
heartâand, inltead of the flriifiures, he will gain
the approbation of A Friend'to Truth.

MR. HOWELL,
A WRI I'ER in one of the New-York papers,
under tlie signature of PHILODEMOS, who
has undertaken to aufwcr some of the fentimenis
advanced by Mr. Adams, in his " Dtfcnce of the
Im. rican Cohji'Uutions," in his jd number, intro
duces a quotation from the xxxi letter of the firft
volume with tliefe wordsâ" The main drift of
'' Mr. Adams's book, is to ihew us the utility
" and necelfity of different orders of men, and
" an equilibrium of powers and privileges."
Sooti after follows another to the fame effect
from the Bth page of the preface. With certain
. eftri<llions, no perlon, who ever attentively
ead ihe writings of that gentleman, could pre
sume to dispute the truth of this aflertion. â Ihe
rxpieff: m " orders of men," as applied by Mr.
Adams to this country, i presume was never in
tended to convey the idea of a superior race of
iiiei>, or dill ; 4 t species of beings ; neither can
it mean an i. vech ary order. There undoubt
edly a-e in America, as in every other country
under Heaver , different dalles, ranks, degrees
or arde< s of men, and things ; yet there is no
physical ne effity, that any of them Ihould be
h editary Oi .â¢ instance alone has ever been
aflfo ded by this country of an hereditary order
of i en. This difHniftion now no longer exists.
âIt is rsboliftied, without leaving a single exam
ple ro pi ove that it ever had a being. Mr. A
dams evidently inculcates " the utility and ne
" celii v of different orders of men, and an e
" quilibrium of powers and privileges," in op
pofrion to tiie sentiments of Mr. Turgot, in his
ler f er to Dr. Price, where he observes that " he
" is nor fatisfied with the Constitutions which
" have hitherto been formed for the different
" Stares of America. By most of them, the cuf
" roms of England are imitated without any
" particular motive. Instead of colledling all
" authority into one centre, that of the nation,
" they have eflablifhed different bodies ; a bo
dy of Repi efenratives, a Council, and a. Go
" vernor ; because there is in England, a House
" of Commons, a House of Lords, and a King.
" They endeavour to balance these different
" powers, as if this equilibrium, which, in En
" be a necellary check to the enor
" fluence of Royalty, could be of any
" ufein' Republicks, founded upon the eqnali
" ty of all rhe citizens, and as it establishing
" different orders of men, was not a source of
" divisions and disputes."
Had the people of America, in coniplaifance
ro this opinion, at orice determined utterly to a
bolish the forms of governtment, which then ex
iited, colleifted all authority into one centre, A
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ; their motives and
principles might have been much more conform
able to those of Mr. Turgot, but how much less
advantageous to themselves, every one will de
cide, as shall prove belt adapted to their inter
efls. Happy for that gentleman, it pleased GOD
to take him from this world, before he had an
npportunity of experiencing the pernicious con
fcqoences of his fyftein upon his own country.
But what is the fignification of different orders
of men, as used by Mr. Turgot ! It evidently
means no more, than separate bodies, or diflinct
blanches of government. âAnd in no other sense
is it used by Mr. Adams, when applied to this
country
Our National Government consists of those
" three orders, and an effectual balance between
them," which are considered indispensable in
every American Conllitution. Our national Se
nate, appointed by the State Legislatures, is a
diflindl order from the Honfe ofÃeprefer.tatives,
appointed, or chosen by the people. The Se
nate may befaid to represent, lleprefentatives of
the people ; the House are the immediate Re
prefentaiives. The President of the United
States is a dilUnct order front the Senate, equal
ly with the King of England from the Houle of
Lords. These orders differ eflemially in one ve
ry important point, that of hereditary descent.
â but surely there is nor a single advantage,
power, or privilege, of any kind, withheld from
either order in our government, merely because
they cannot descend.

on of their terms, the orders are extinil. When
a new election takes place, the ordcts revive,
though, perhaps, not in rhe fame persons with
which they expired. To render it (till more e
vident that Mr. Adatns had no idea of a diflinCt
order of men, as such ; I shall take the liberty to
use his own words in the firft volume of his De
fence, letter xxiii.
" In every country we have found a variety
" of orders, with very great diflincftions. In
" America, there are different orders of offices,
" but none ofmen ; out of office, all men are of
the fame species, and of one blood, there is
" neither a greater, nor a lefler nobilityâWhy
" then accnfed of establishing different orders
" of men ?" From this paflage, it is evident,
that an order of nobility, nor any kind of here*
ditary diftimtion was ever intended. Words
of inheritance, are by no means neceilary quali
fications in the character of an order or office ;
on the contrary, the mnjl worthy, fliould he terms
of conveyance, and election the method of invef
titnre, or induction. A sentiment, or expression,
was scarcely ever committed to paper, that did
not contain some word, admitting different nulli
fications, and variety of conftrudtions ; âperhaps
no example will better illullrate this truth, than
the wordâORDER.
It is worthy of obfervatiÂ»n, that a majority of
the writers in newspapers tlioughout the
nent, addsefs themselves to the readers of
newspapers, rather than readers of books { sup
posing that the generality of people will impli
citly confide in their aflertion's, without consult
ing originals âThis method is undoubtedly fa
vorable to their produ&ions ; for to inen-of
reading, and real information, both the writings
and their authors are equal objects of pity and
commiseration. The whole system of these writ
ers, appears limilar to that of a merchant, at
tempting to dispose of adulterated liquors, by
giving them a luperior recommendation to thole
which are pure 1 wifha more salutary sys
tem to be heard in oppofition.âlrs brevity will
probably be the best recommendation. If health
of body, and tranquility of mind be objetfts wor
thy of confederation ; my advice, as a Fhyfician
and Divine, would be this :âNever attempt to
allay thirst at an impure stream, when the wa
ters of the fountain are so much more pleafanr,
wholefomeand palatable, and so easily obtained.
âIf this prescription does not answer the pur
pose for which it is intended, well may we ex

[Inverted by M. Roland, Profejfor of Natural Philosophy at the Univer-
Jtty of PariÂ«.]
LET there be made a double bellows, the middle board being
common to both. In the centre of each external board, or
back, pierce a round holt for the inlertion of a valve. The extre
mity or point of this double bellows must be cemented into a cop
per box, including two valves, which communicate with the irv
fide of the bellows. The cover of this copper box, which screws
on with an intei mediate piece of leather, is shaped like a funnel,
to the pipe of which is joined a flexible tube, made of spiral wire
covered with a gummed taffaty, with an ivory pipe at the end, to
be infeited into the nostril. If you rather choose to introduce it
into the mouth, the ivory pipe may be flattened a little. Each of
theie (our valves consists of a copper neck, closed at one end by a
piece of gummy taffaty, larger than the bore of the neck, and
hinged by a strong silken thread, wound round the neck, so that
the valve opens when you blow into the tube. These valves fit
into other copper tubes fixed into the bellows; but so disposed,
that the two external, and the two internal valves may open, the
one inward, the other outward, so as to work alternately. The
two valves within the box commun cate with the bellows through
one common tube. Having fixed the ivory pipe of the flexible
tube in thenofiril of the fubjeft, you gently open the bellows, by
which operation the bad air in the lungs will be drawn out into
one half of the bellows, and the other filled with atmospheric air.
You then dose the bellows, the atmospheric air will thus be for
cer] into the lungs, and that air, which was drawn out of the
will tfcape. By thus continuing the operation, you will oblii;Â®
he lungs to perform the a6t of inspiration arid expiration, and
;radually induce the organ to refumc its function, if the fubjeft be
ot absolutely dead. The opetator mull be very careful not to
rocced with too much preclpiiation. If vou choose to anpl*
ilogifticaied aii mflcad of atmospheric, it is <afy to perform
i communication with one of the external valves, from a bladder,
iecuted by a coek, containing that air.

0\ Monday next the petition of a number of rcfpeftablc in
habitants, preferred to the lait 'I own-Meeting, will be
cblcufT-d, and the report ot your School Committee heard.
An object of such importance demands attention. Patriotism
and charily nuift awake the attention of the rich and the poor.
Let all riflcÂ£lon ihe great and-maoiftft advantages, to be de
rived from aii adoption of the ineafure proposed by the petition.
Lit the pariotifm of all induce them zcaloufly to forward an at
tempt to feeurc'our political felicity. by giving to the riling ge
neration the means of acquiring a knowledge of ihe nature of
civil libcity. and of the meafuies to be adopted to perpetuate
the enjoymeftt of it.
A system, giving to all equal opportunity for the acquisition
of knowledge, would tend more toward eftab'.ifhing in practice
the theoretical rights of men, than all our Constitutions or Bills
ot Rights. The savage is interior to the citizen in proportion to
their advantages in point of education.
The fame cause, in civilized life, works the famr difference.
The son of the rich man, enjoying all poflible afliftances from
inftruttors und books, is more powerful in mental acquisitions
than the son of the poor man, from whom the hand of penury,
and the coldness of charity have withheld the means of per
fecting his powers.
Had the latter poflfffed equal advantages he had, perhaps,
demonstrated to the world, that not birth and rank, but educa
tion and merit, produce in society the only rational inequality.
All other inequalities should, if poflibie, be remedied; but
never can be remedied, while children, at the firft dawn of rea
son, and through their whole lives, fee such diftin&ions as now
prevail in point of education, The unhappy being, who finds
his inftrii&ion neglc&ed and discouraged by the world, must
surely think, that nothing ufeful could be expe&ed from him, or
that inftru&ion had no power over the faculties of his foul.
Is he in fafcfc a genius of thefirft rank ?âHe will then either waste
his powers m indolenceâor, from the irrcfiflible efforts of his
genius to activity, will become great in vice, and fall abhorred
by the virtuous, a miserable example of the depravity of man
On the present system of education, the mental powers of
nbout a third part only of its citizens arc ever known to society.
arc not even tried. I rom this third part alone can the
r-(.#ple choose their magiftratcs, or fill up the proleflions of the
libera! arts.
In cafe a plan could be devised, by which the whole rising ge
neration might be placed nearly on a level in the means of ac
quiring knowledge, they would proceed equably, till by the
operation of an emulative ambition thenaturul and rational ine
quality should be produced.
Here every genius would be triedâevery faculty exercifcd â
every talent exertedâthe mod brilliant and ufeful discoveredâ
and the body of men best qualified for the discharge of important
duties fclc&ed, not from a third part only, but from the tvhole.
Upon a plan of this fort, the superior mind, which on the pre
sent system is loft to the world, would come forward to his
station, which might otherwise be occupied by his natural inferior
To d iffufe a general knowledge of the moll ufeful learningâ
to place in such a situation the native diamond, olt enciufted with
ignorance, that the fplcndour of its rays may add lustre to out
day, i.l the object of the plan to be preferred on Monday by your
School.Committee. By this plan a general system is proposed to
be carried into effect, at the expence and under the direction of
the town, by which all the children of the inhabitants will re
ceive inftruÂ£tiou in the fame fckools. This is not to be merely a
I'tee School, to which those whose pride will permit them to ac
knowledge their poverty may fend their children, foinetimes to.
be taught, and oftener to be abused. This is to be instituted on
the broad b?'.is of republican principles. Here all the young
fre en (hall for once be equal; they will here all be inftru&ed,
arc' alike inftru&ed, at the town's expence.âHere, placed at one
fourm ,the children of thehumbleand of the high shall make trial
of their genius ; and at the termination of their exertions, the
f- holar shall be compensated by the value of his acquisitions, and
the appJaule of hisiownfmen.
This is no v fionar) fchemc ; it is pot the offspring of a heated
imagination, or an itch for novelty. It is framed byourwifeft
citizen , as an improvement on a plan long ago adopted, and fuc
et fsfully adhered to, in other places, celebrated for their love of
freedom and good government.
Sec its effe&s in the town of Boston : I am credibly informed,
that ai: lead fix out of eight of their principal llatefmep, magis
trates, lawyers and divines, owe the loundation of their eminence
to schools of this kind. Without the aid of these, their parents,
perhaps from poverty, had given them no education, or from
ignorance of their talents had negleÂ£ted to cherish them.
From the latter cause, frequently arises a most deplorable
left of genius : But give the parent an opportunity to discover,
without expense, the abilities of his child, and if the experiment
lucceeds agreeable to his wifnes, he will use every exertion to
forward his education, and thus from accident at firft, and a cer
tain parental pride or tenderness afterwards, his country maybe
benefited by a sage philosopher, or a wife politician.
My indulgent fellow-citizens will paidon the liberty I have
taken, while I only add, that it is my earnest request, and in
which I am joined by a very great number of more ancient and
influential chara&ers than myfelf, that every free male inhabitant,
heads of families in a more especial manner, would lay aside other
concerns, and attend on the Town-Meeting next Monday, in the
afternoon, to consider and decide on the important measure of
cftablifhing Tmvr-School's Tme Shade of Busby.

is well kndwn, that those whose hearts are tainted with them, are

to Mr. Paine's rights of Man. The author, in his last number,
has in the most unequivocalterms declared that the Vice President
had no concern whatever in the publication. His adverfarics,
therefore, ought to be covered with confufion, and the public
fiiould resent the injury done to a faithful old servant. Notwith

THE black and white cockades will not tak: ; it
seems that thole which appeared onTuefday last
at the Theatre were only put on for an experi-
ment
Some citizens in the gallery of the Provincial-
Aflembly moved to fend back to Bourdeaux, the
firft cargo of Negroes which (hould enter info
this port from thence : A number of othermotions
were made, which appeared dilated by despair.
The President represented in the pame of the
Aflembly, that t(fe Colony alone had a right to
express the people's sense of the measure. He
informed them, that notice had been fenc to all
the parilhes of the decree of the ijth of May.
Some members moved addrefles to the National
Aflembly, but nothing was deliberated upon.
An Address of the Merchants of Bordeaux,
to the Chambers of Commerce and Merchants of
the French Colonies, on the fubjed; of the decree
of the National Aflembly refpedting the Negroes
and Mulattoes, born o'f free parents, has been
received.âlt is couched in patriotic terms, and
breathes a truly conciliatory spirit.â and recom
mends an acquiescence in the Decree, as " a law
juit ill its principles, beneficent in its dispositions,
and irrevocable as the conflitution of the tmptre.
The Provincial Aflembly of the north has de
creed, that addrefl'es (hould be sent to the Na
tional Aflembly, to the directory of the depart
ment of Gironde (of which Bordeaux is the ca
pital) andall the chambers of comwerxe in France.
All those addrefles will tend
ecution of the decree of the 15th of May, would
prove hurtful to the security and prosperity of
St. Domingo. _
The white and black cockades have difappearen,
j but the greatest part of the citizens have laid by
the national cockade.
The free peeple of colour are quiet. The or
der of the Board of Police, against diftorbers or
the public peace, has eased the minds of tbÂ° e
who were the molt alarmed, and the greate
circutnfpeiflion has taken with them the place o
their former terror.

RICHMOND, July 29.
Extract of a letter from a gentleman near the mouth
of the French Broad, on the banks of the Hudson,
dated Treaty Ground, June 16, I 791.
" Presuming you may wish to know how Go
vernor Blount proceeds in the Treaty with the
Cherokees, I take this opportunity to inform
you that as yet no Cherokees have appeared, but
there is now every reason to believe that the
fulled representation ever known of that nation
will be in by the 20th, and that a good treaty
will be formed. The Governor has had much
difficulty in securing a treaty, for he certainly
has been opposed by more designing land job
bers, speculators and abandoned miscreants,
who live among the Cherokees, than ever before
fell to the lot of man."
Philadelphia, August io.
A proposition to enter into a non dijliltation
agreement in order to counteract the excise, hav
ing been made to the di(Hllers in Providence by
some of the distillers in New-York, âa writer in
a Providence paper, suggests the following que
ries on the occasion :âWhether luch a measure
has not a tendency to tarnish and diflionor the
riling credit of our country, in counteracting
one of the belt, 1110(1 productive and moll popu
lar sources of its revenue, agreed upon and eita
blifhed by Congress, after the molt careful and
deliberate con(idevatÂ»oii,at two different feflions ?
Is this the most eligible mode of effecting what
is said to be desired ? Will Congress, the legisla
tive body of a free and enlightened people be
driven, by an agreement of this kind, to abandon
the interest of their condiments collectively con
fklered ? If any thing is wrong, in the fyftern,
Congress will undoubtedly be willing to hear
and redress every well founded complaint : But
before a measure which has the appearance offo
i>nch temper, as a non-dillillation agreement, is
adopted, fotne more feafable mode of taxation
should be pointed out.
The trailfacfiions of the general government
refpeifting the Indians, are and have been found
ed' in jnfticc and humanityâbut the machina
tions of unprincipled land jobbers are the off
fpring of fraud, treachery, and insatiable ava
rice. The treaties that were formed under the
old confederation, had for their object the secu
rity of the frontiers, and calming aad securing
the Indiaus in their nnceded pofle/fions ; but the
feeble arm of government was not fufficient to
restrain the rapacity of land speculators, hence
the yellow savages have too often found the trea
ties a feeble barrier to the murders and depreda
tions of the whits savages. But it is to be hoped
that government will in future enforce the laws,
and carry their benevolent plans, and the stipu
lations of their treaties, into prom; t execution
by the strong arm of power. '
The late Revolution in Poland in favor of the
liberties of that country, may justly be consi
dered as another instance of rhe -.idvanrage deri
ved to mankind from the independence of the
United States , and'the reference in the King's
speech to the new Conftirudon of this Republic,
is a truly honorable testimony to the wisdom and
patriotism of the illuilrious Convention which
fiamed it.
A free press is essential to the prelervation o? liberty; hut a li
eentious press almost destroys the utility of printing:âfor tho a
free government will not attempt to fupprefsthe fulled and freeft
difcuflion of public me a fares, yet a general circulation of lies and
misrepresentations will foonrr or later destroy all confidence in
the vehicles of public intelligence. The unbounded licence as
sumed by the French Printers and Editors of Paris, in canvafling
public characters, mull greatly confufc and perplex the public
mind. Arijlocrats and Democrats, are equally the objects of the
most virulent satire and abuseâand the allegations are as positively
denied as they are advanced ; so that like opposing bodies in ex
act contact, both charges and denials fall to the ground. The Na
tional Assembly appears unmoved amidflthis clashing of opinions,
and (leadily pursues its great object, the compleat organization of
the government.
POLITICAL SKETCH.
THE benign influences of the general govern
ment are strikingly apparent in the patriotic (late
of frfiw-Jei feyâ the limits prefcri'bed on this oc
casion will not admit of descending to particu
larsâfufHcient for the purpose of enforcing the
truth of the observation, is that general tranqui
lity of the state which has been produced by the
equalizing operation of the laws of the union.
When New-Jersey loft her excellent Livingfton,
(he repaired the breach by her Paterfonâa gen
tleman whose election was equally honorable to
liimfelf, and to his electorsâMay the future elec
tions of our country be conducted with equal una
nimity, moderation and wisdom. The evil-eyed
demon of jealousy does not appear to have influ
enced on this occasionâand the merit of an np
right federal legislator, did not prove a difquali
fication to serve the state in the highest of its of
fices. New-Jersey, as the connecting lint be
tween Philadelphia and New-York, with a lau
dable spirit of enterprize, is now engaged in plans
to facilitate the communication from each to the
otherâand such is the ardor with which these
plans are prosecuted, that in a period not very
remote, we may expect to fee her enjoying ini
menfe advantages as the rewards of her exertions,
from her bridges and improved roads ; âwhile
the general benefits derived to the community at
large will excite surprize, and enkindle a lauda
ble emulation in her neighbouts.
111 adverting to the lunation of affairs in the
state of New-York, a cluster of ideas rush on the
mind. Tho'placed in the focus of the late war,
the intrepidity and patriotism of the whigs of
that state, rose superior to an opposition, formi
dable both on account of internal and external
enemies. How aftonithingly has she emerged
from the effedts of war and desolation !âhercir
cumftances as a government, are the wonder and
admiration of her sister Itates, and of the world !
and if /he is just to herfelf, and will repose a de
cent and manly confidence in the wisdom and ad
vice of her best informed citizens, her abundant
resources will be applied to plans of such public
utility, as will be prodn&ive of advantages that
cannot be calculatedâbut on the other hand,
should a contracted, heavy policy prevail, which
shrinks from an immediate expence, that will be
almost infinitely reimbursed, the wings of her
fame and prosperity will be clipped, ar.d still
keep her in the rear of her enterprizing rival,
the state of Pennsylvania.*
The natural advantages of this state are so
great, that a comparatively small expenceto im
prove them, would place her in a most eligible
lituation. Her recent accession of territory, and
increase of population, while they extend the
fpbere of her trade and commerce, enhance her
importance greatly in the political scale of the
union.
The state of Connedlicut exhibits perhaps the
mod perfeifl model of a republican government,
of any community that can be mentionedâand
this is probably the cafe more from precedent
and usage, than any other circujmftances. In the
late revolution she bore a eonfpicuous part; and
in proportion to her population, furnifhed per
haps the greatest number of diftingoifhed offi
cers of any state in the unionâwhile her troops
were of the best and bravest veterans in the ar
mies of the continent.
Her literary character is second to none in the
datesâand for uniting the ufefitl with the pleas
ing in fugitive speculations, ftie takes the lead,
and fees an example to?.!! the reft : These specu
lations are republilhed tliro' the union, and re
ceived with universal approbation. An incredi
ble number of newspapers is printed and circu
lated thro this stateâthey are read by all the
citizensâthey understand and are tenacious of
their rights, because they are enlightenedâand
rhey are enlightened, because the rays of learn
ing illumine every part of their countryâthe
ueans are accessible to all, without diftinttion.â
Connecticut is making great progress in com
merce, agriculture, and the ufeful arts âand is
continually strengthening her claim to that ce
lebrity which (he has acquired as a manufactur
ing state. [To be coutinu:d.~\
* While the state of Pennsylvania has appropriated upwards of
25,000!. currency, for the laudable purpose ot promoting theinter
conrfe and navigation in the interior part of the State.âThe Le
giflatureof New-York, it is said, has appropriated only one thou
sand pounds for a similar purpose.
SPECULATION.
WHAT magic this among the people,
That swells a maypole to a ileeplc ?
Touih'd by the wand of Speculation,
A frenzy iuns thro all the nation ;
For foou or late, so truth advises,
Things muff aflume their proper sizesâ
And furc as death all mortals trips,
Thousands will rue their faith in SCRIPS.
REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF LONGEVITY IN A HORSE.
DlEDâLaft week at the Pennsylvania Hospital, the old horse
called Braddock ; supposed to be about 41 or 42 years of age.
There is no reason to question his being one of the horses em
ployed on the expedition of General Braddock in the year 1755.
He was blind with age, and his teeth being fairlv worn down
with use, he was scarcely able to eat hay the iaft year of his life.

jJtsouRDITIES.
THAT the children of those, who by a fortu
itous concurrence of circutnftances, or by indus
try and the practice of the severer virtues of
economy, temperance and sobriety, have acquir
ed a fortune, fhotild be educated to the practice
of similar virtues, or any virtue whatever, in or
der to preserve what their fathers have acquired
for them.
That discipline should be thought neceflary to
form the body or mind to a&ivity, health and
virtueâwhen other animals, which it must be
acknowledged, are less manageable than the hu
man species, are trained to ufefulnefs, without
restraint, bit pr bridle.
That vicious indulgences, idleness, profane
nefs, lying, baseness and cruelty, flioakl be con
sidered as indicative of an education that will
lead to infamy, to depredations on society, to ig
nominy and a premature death.
T'liat the art of speaking is better than the art
of boxingâand that to inculcate the principles
of justice, clemency, and sensibility on the minds
of children, will probably make them better riiem
bers of society than the arts of petty peculation ;
a (harnelefs contempt of the miseries of the un
happy, and a savage delight in doing mifchief.
That learning, virtue, honor and fame, are
the refultof discipline, study and diligenceâthat
the hill of science is steep and difficult to ascend
âand that a total relaxation of all rule and or
der in society, whether on the larger or smaller
scale, is pregnant with disgrace, difappointmenr
confulion and ruin. IRONICUS.

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven; to those who are not,fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful fuuation is not fu'rpaffed, if equalled by any ; be
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be fa id
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the lound
but by reason of the flats, this wharf is nei.effarily extended to the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when complrat
cd, will be the mod extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3-4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the Spates will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all clafles of people, for
thefuccefsol this enterptize, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there more
