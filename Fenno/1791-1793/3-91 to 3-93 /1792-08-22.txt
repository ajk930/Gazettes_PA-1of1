â *.0M THE AMERICAN V'JSEU.'-f.
REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION,
Concerning the public delis.
(CONTINUED.)
IT will not lie questioned, that there i*> in
every walk of life or bulinefs a greater pro
portion of money, than was obfervabie two
years ago. Public works and buildings of eve
ry kind, and of species and values unknown
among us till the present time, aie undertaking
every where. Private buildings, of equal va
riety. and comparative value, are springing up.
The >rice of lands is advanced. The raw ma
terials,though raifeu in much greater abundance,
lell for larger prices. To what cause so pow
erful, so adequate, can these things be ascribed,
as to the sales of part and the re-animation of
the whole, of a public debt, ten times larger
than the amount of all the specie ordinarily cir
culating in the country ?
The relief of some of the States from their
burdens, has been another beneficial consequence
of the funding of the debt. It is but a few
years since one of the mod frugal, vigorous, and
productive counties in Pennsylvania rose against
the collectors of the taxes. The appreciation
and fa!e of the immense mass of federal securi
ties, owned by that State, has enabled her to
discharge all her obligations, though flie has
abolilhed her general land tax, and discontinued
her excise, both of which Ihe has collected for
forty years.
!>ome anxiety has been created by the fliare
of our debt, which foreigners have obtained.
But this was a powerful means of bringing the
whole into its pre fen t beneficial aw ion, by ele
vating its actual to its nominal value. It is
not at all probable, that it will be drawn from
the country. It has been observed, in the inoft
tranquil and prosperous state of Europe, that a
great proportion of che families of those foreign
ers, who have made large inveflments in the
United States, either in the times of the pro
vinces, or since the revolution, have become
inhabitants of this country, even when in its
rudest infant Hate. At this serious moment,
when almost everv transatlantic country feel;
or apprehends disorders, our chances are in
finitely increased. The United States, advan
ced in the means cffubfiftence, of comfprt, and
01 twiv picfe/it to them aa object of
greater chfire in a tranquil liberty, which they
are flruggling to obtain, a teeming agriculture,
and a prosperous commerce, both fortign am!
internal. Conformably with these refle&ions,
we may affirm, that no great object in our af
fairs has failed to attract the notice of the fo
reigners, who have engaged in our funds. The
internal navigation of South-Carolina, North-
Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Penn!y*vania,
New-Jersey and New-York, are among the wit
nelfes of this truth. The banks, both national
and State, the turnpike roads, and toll bridges,
the sales of city estates, of cultivated farms,
and particularly of unimproved lands, com
merce, Ihip-building, manufactures, confirm
the fact. Let us continue to exhibit an honest
spirit in our laws and conlÃtutions, an efficient
execution of them, and due abflinence from un
neceflary wars, and there cannot exist a doubt,
that we shall draw much more copiously from
the population, the arts, and the funds of Eu
rope, than they will draw from those of the
United States.
There exists in tliÂ« United States one de
scription of private difSculties .and incumbran
ces, which must engage the lolicitude of every
feeling mind, which, by an examination into
the detail and interior of our afEiirs, lias been
led to observe them. The cases alluded to are
those of the citizens of two or three of the
States, who are burdened with heavy debts or
claims, which originated before the revolution.
Whatever they may lie finally adjudged to pay,
the sum may be so great, and due from so many
perion-, as to give it the resemblance of a pub
lic debt : and as in one of those States it has
already occasioned some facrifices of their prin
cipal landed estates, very far below their va
lue, so t will probably operate in the others,
unless some extensive means, abundantly ade
quate to the occasion, cap be brought to ope
rate, before or at least at the time of execut
ing the judgments of courts, ivbich may be ob-
Gained. No resource, competent to the pur
pose, appears at all likely to prcfent itfeif, un
less it be the funded debt or stock of the United
States and of the several State*. The method
by which tiiis de'eription of property can be
rendered mod immediately and effectually fub
(ervient to the iiiterefting purpose of prevent
ing the deftruflion of many families, would
'eeiri to be the fixture of it at a stable unfluctu
ating rate, adequate to its proper value, under
the exiftine circumstances of the United States.
It is manifeft, that infucb aftate of the.market,
the dealers in the debt and others, would fell!
out, and would not buy in again, and that they
would seek objects for their money in the trade,
the manufactures, the buildings, and the lands,
of the country, which might promise them more ;
advantage. A tenth part of die value of the
piibfic debt', applied to the lands of the United
States; tiropid raise them every where to tlieir'
real fp, that the debtor, \rlio mijrht be
uider the neceflity to fell an eftatej could dif-
$ioo
[Whole No. 546.]
pose of his property-not only withoutruinous
f aci ifice, but probably to uncommon advat>tage.
Ihe propriety ol lands and buildings which
might be under this probability of lale, would
fullain no rifqueor injury in felling their eftatcs
for the public ltock.
It may be alledged, that the holders of the
debt will not go into fcferies so remote to make
investments : but there are facts, which appear
to warrant zdifferent opinion. The ot"
New-England have been brought into Pennfvl
vania, for ir.vellmcnt in lands of several kiiid;
âthe money of Pennsylvania and Delaware
has been invested in mills and lands in Virginia
âthe greater pa tof the iron-works of Mary
land (the most coftlv estates in our country)
were bought and worked by the capitals of re
lldents in Great-Britain before the revolution.
The fame fact existed in one great instance in
New-Jersey The greatelt cedar swamp, on
the waters of the Delaware, that supplies the
Philadelphia market, is owned in New England;
and people and vessels from that quarter, are
annually sent to perform thebufmefs of it. The
American public creditors, citizens oi the uni
ted Netherlands, have recently purchased eight
hundred rratts ofland in spartnfPeiinfylvania,
further from Philadelphia than the banks oi"
James's River, York, or Rappahanock. In
short, if the history of this country were ex
amined, as it regards this Jubjeft, it would de
monstrate, that the landed property of it lias
been conftantiy animated by the application of
the monies of di.tant capitalifls.
LONDON, May 30,
HOUSE OF COMMONS.
Monday Mat 21.
RIOTS AT BIRMINGHAM.
SIR ROBERT LAWLEY presented
a petition from certain Difient
eis, 1 ruftees of the new meeting;
lioufe which had been burnt at Bit
mingham, praying for compcnfation
of damages received, &c.
The Speaker cbferved, that as the
limited lime for receiving private pe
ti-tions was expired, and :is, this vat
of that nature, it could not be receiv
ed.
The petition was withdrawn.
Mr. Wh i tbr e a D, jun. rose to m ake
his promised motion refpetfting the
Birmingham riots. He laid, tl.aton
this occasion he confidercd hiuifelf
not only as the advocate for the fuf
fering Diflcnters at Birmingham, but
for the Diflenters in general, and al
io for all the people of Great-Britain,
whose heft and dearest rights were
ftrnck at in the outrageous violation
of the laws, 111 the unhappy affair at
Birmingham â laws which were or
dained equally for the protection of
every fubjert in the kingdom, be his
religious tenets what they may. He
aliened, that the unhappy difference
between the Diflenters and the High
Church party at Birmingham had its
rife in religious and not in political
concerns. He was very diffufe 111 sup
port of this polition, reciting cir
cumftaiices, and quoting various au
thorities in proof of this allertion.
He then, much in detail, recited the
origin, rife, and progress of the ri
ots ; the immediate and ostensible
instigation of which was a hand-bill,
of the molt inflammatory and scanda
lous natine, which had been circu
lated a lliort time previous to the
commencement of the riots ; and
which the magifirates had taken 110
steps about until the morning of (he
14th of July, in the afternoon of
which the riots began ; âon this day
they offered a re ward for the pub
lisher of the hand-bill. Ihe condudt
of thele gentlemen (the magistrates)
during the time ofthe riots, was, he
laid, peculiarly > eprehenfible ; they
ac'ted with fupincnefs, if not worse ;
and in fume inffances they had, inÂ»
stead of 1 e'lraii.ing, absolutely encou
raged the rioters to ac r ts of outrage.
They might, if so inclined, have
crufhedthe mifchief in the bud, bnc
110 steps wete taken ; they even re
lufed the aftiflance of an officer with
his recruiting party, then in town,
who offered with it to quell the riois.
Their exertions wereconfined to pub
lishing advertlf'ements and hand-bills,With vefpeift to the trials of the riot
ers, lie disapproved of the conduct oi
government in them. The witnefles
of the fufferers were permit be
intimidated by the populace, and
therebv prevented from giving pi o
per evidence : some were acqWfed,
though guilty 011 the clearclt evi
dence, and every partiality /hewn
the culprits. The pardon granted to
the rioter Hands, he-compared to that
granted some years ago, for iimilar
reasons, to rhe notorious Macqun k ;
and whenjulUce was fiifferecl to take
its coui fe, and verdicts found for the
fufferers, the damages allowed were
far from being fufficient. Viewing
matters in this light, and which he
hoped the hoofe would fee and feel
with him, he found himfelf obliged,
for the honor of the Church and State
of England, to attempt to explore and
redreia those grievances ; he there
fore would move, " That an humble
" address be presented to his majef
" ty, praying that he will order to
" be laid before the Houle, an ac
count of the information received
" by his ministers concerning the
l< conduct of the magistrates of \Var
" wick and Worcestershire, relative
" to the riots in Birmingham in J uly
" I 791, and what had been the con
Â« duct of his majelty's ministers in
" consequence thereof, &c."
The motion was seconded by Mr.
Grey.
Sir Robert La wlev said, that he
had received a requiiition, signed by
niany respectable persons among his
conllituents (ot Warwickshire) that
he Ihould, if the charatflers of the
Birmingham magistrates were at
tacked in (he couife of the debate
expecfted this evening', take an op
portunity of vindicating them, and
to express their grateful sense of the
proper conducft of those gentlemen
on the occasion alluded to. His own
opinion on the fubjetft was, that the
Hon. Gentleman was stirring up the
embers of a dying flame.
Mr. Secretary Dundas said, that
to the elaborate declamations of the
Hon. Gentleman, and to his garbled
statement of occurrences, he Ihould
oppose a plain narrative of fa<3s ;
and the Houle, he doubted not, would
come to a proper decifionon the fub
jert. Whatever might have been the
remote causes of the animosities in
queltion, he would not now consider ;
the effecfts were visible ; the operati
on of a mob he thought the word po
litical evil. The latter causes of dif
fention between the J)iflenters and
Church Party at Birmingham were,
he said, more of a political than of a
religious nature ; these had been ex
cited and favored by the perpetual
circulation of inflammatory and fedi
tious writings ; these had prejudiced
the minds of one party againll the o
ther ; and the immediate causes of
the flame breaking out, were, ill,the
notice of the intended celebration of
the French Revolution ; and, adly,
the appearance of the fcandalons and
inflammatory hand-bill. He then de
tailed the steps taken by gentlemen
in the business from the fir 11 account
received, to the execution of the cri
minals The fii ft accounts received
by government were on the Saturday
morning following the commence
ment of the riots, and instantly orders
were iflued from the Secretary of
State's and the War Office, for the
nearest troops to Birmingham to
inarch to that place. These were at
Nottingham, and so expeditioufly
were the orders conveyed and exe
cuted, that the troops were in Bir
mingham on the evening of the fame
day of which the accounts were fii ft
received. Soon after their arrival,
the tumults were quelled. Respect
ing the legal part of the tranfadtions,
Mr. Chamberiayne, Solicitor of the
Treasury, Mr. Justice Bond, and a
Barrister to afllft them, were immedi
ately sent to make the necefl'ary en
quiries j the result of which was,
that 13 persons appeared to them to
deserve to be rigorously and capitally
prosecuted, which they were ; five of
whom were sentenced to die, and of
which number one was pardoned, on
the mod politive proofs of perfect in
nocence. He concluded by exprefl
ing his hostility to the motion.
Mr. VVyndihm was of opinion,
that notwithfbanding what he had
heard, there was something dark and
mysterious in several parts of the bu
finefs, which seemed to caH for an
earnest enquiry.
Mr. Jenkinso'n, in a flioit speech,
defended the condudt of government
in the entire tranfadtion > bethought
they had a<fted with integrity and vi
gor.
After fonie further conterfation
the queltion was put, and the Koufe
dividedâAyes 46 âNoes 189.
fYlajority 143 againlt Mr. Whit
bread's motion. AdjoUruid.
The Proclamation offendsâgiofsly
offends alt thofi? seditious peifons,
who, with such industrious zfcsi are
endeavoring to sow the feed*- K)f dif
comenc in the minds of the people
and therefore it is natural they Ihould
express their disapprobation of it.
But those who love their country and
admire the conltitution under which
it has so long flourifhed, confiderthis
Proclamation at a mod heceffary inea
fure
| ( is called by the hirelings of the
editious party, " an unheard of fpe
â¢ies of Inquifitien," and it certainly
is to them an Inquisition that they
have a righc to dreadâfor neither
their words nor their adions can ho
neltly stand the left of enquiry.
Had Ministry ifl'ued an order that
was to operate contrary to law, there
might indeed be just reason to com
plain ; but whew the Proclamation
enjoins no morethan the conlHtution
warrants âthe statutes ena&-âand
the peace of the public requires, he
tnuft be an incendiary whose views
are thwarted, that dares to find fault
with it.
Will any man pretend to fay, that
there are not a (et of people hired
for the purpose of biafling the minds
of the lower class of people, and put
them out of humor with our confti
tution, that they insinuate themselves
into ale-houi'es, taverns and debating
focieties,in order by pamphlets,hand
bills, or oral persuasives to lead the
minds of the populace from their loy
alty and obedience ? It therefore is
become the duty of Ministers to check
this spirit offedition in the beginning
âto nip the treason in its bud, and
bring all such daring incendiaries to
that punishment which the lawânot
the proclamation, provided.âThe
proclamation is but declaratory, of
rhe law, and the law is a legitimate
ofFspring of the Constitution.
Yesterday the gentleman who has
undertaken to raise the Royal George,
brought up one of the stern gallery
windows.
The Earl of Wycombe is shortly to
be married to Miss Hunt, of Seymour

BASSETERRE, (St. Chris.) July 19
CAPTURE OF SERI\GAPATAM
A veflel bound from England to
Dominica, fell in with a Ihip dispatch
ed by Lord Cornwallis from the East-
Indies, with the glorious news of the
defeat of Tippoo, and the surrender
of his capital. The Capt- of the In
diaman hailed the above veflel, and
desired her commander to come on
board, which he did, and found there
Lord Cornwallis's Aid-de-Camp, who
wrotea short letter to '-<overnor Orde,
and enclosed him the Madras fjazette
with the particulars. A gentleman
whose veracity may be depended on,
has arrived here from Dominica :

He saw the Gazette, which mentions,
" That Lord CorliWallis pushed on
the siege with the greatest vigor -
The alacrity of the army .in general,
and the alertnels with which the ap
proaches were carried on by Gen.
Meadows, was such, that uotwith
landing every inch of ground was
bravely ana vigorously defended by
Tippod| who commanded in person

the Sultan and garrison were confined
to the citadel, from whence he offer

minions, and upwards of three milli

the treaty wa3 signed, the Sultan with
his two sons one of n years old and
the other 7, marched through the
British army, which was drawn up to

Extratt of a litter from the Commandant

lon. to the Confut of France, in Bojlon,
dated the l\th of July, 1792.
" As we are absolutely in want of
frefh pi ovifions, 1 wilh you would be
so kind as to endeavor to persuade
the Americans to bring us live oxen,
(beep, poultry, See. They will surely
find a market for them, more el'peci
ally with the frigates which have the
calh.
" I cannot conceive what has pre
vented the Americans from bringing
us boards this year. They would
have fold them, for we are absolutely
in want of them."
If the information is well founded,
that a French squadron, bound to this

conclude that tranquility is complete

BRUTUS (a writer in Mr. Freneau's Nation*
Ga/.eiie) inquires, after comparing (he sup
porters of government to the hireling writers in tin
Englift* papers who are paid Jot their aoufe>" when,
Â«' arc we to look for the advantages which the
44 people have gained by the conilituiiou of the
Â« United States ? Is it, he asks, to the profpeous
4 Â» situation of our mechanics and manufacturers,
t* who on account of severe duties on fait, tea,
and other"neceiranes of life have been un
der the necefliry at raiting their work in oider
Â«Â« to support their families ? Is it the mercham
44 whole business is liable to be deranged, and-his
" calculations fruftrated by the opinion ot a fccre
" tary of the treaUrry ? Is it to our commerce
41 more than ever embai railed with vexatious rc
tl gulaiions ? Or i* it to the great body of yco
" manry prevented from felung the produce of
" their farms to foreigners, and having an exciL
" man planted in every quarter of the country,
" like in overseer on a Negro plantation, to pre
vent the firmer from making use of the produce
ti of his own labour." All the laws reipeCtingl
these subjeCts, it seems are exceedingly obnoxious
to the writers in the National Gazette, are abomina
bly bad, ought to be annihilated, and all who had
any concern in their enaction forever excluded font
Con*ref'; then as these genilerrien tell us aimoit in
every National Gazette, we Ihould under the new \
adminijl ration of affairs, enjoy a return of true re- i
publican days,the good days previons to the adop
tion of the conftiiution ; days and times which I
am persuaded, a vast majority ot the people of the
United States, most heartily deprecate. That the
la w for the encouragement of manufactures has de
fers ; that the law for regulating trade and lav
ing duties has defcCts ; that the law providing tor
the payment of the public debt has defeats ; that
the excise law has defeCts, will not be denied by
the warmest advocate for the government : but
can it be doubted that when these defcCls come to
be known, experienced and pointed out, they
will not be remedied. Why do not these reform
ers, who have never yet, through the organ of the
National Gazette, found occasion to praifea Jingle
wteafure of government, why do they not go to work
like honorable men and point out their defcCts.
Why instead of laying their finger upon them one !
by one, and suggesting fome'.hing better in their
stead do they deal always in general declamation
and indijeriminate censure, a mode of writing which
ha* never yet either injlruaed or enlightened man
kind ; a mode of writing which eifeCtually dif
fualifies from judging, and yet Brutus and his
party, requires that the people should pas's sentence.
But what is the veal filuation of things, for that is
a tefl within the knowledge and comprehtnfion of
mechanics, manufacturers, farmetsand merchants,
all of whom it seems are called upon to unite un
der the banners of Br utu s, to pull to pieces the
government and the laws. Are our artizans and
manufacturers, as Brutus implicates declining in
their business and ? No. We alien
that they never were in this country in a more
thriving or growing condition, or at any former
period could they contemplate such promising
prof ieÂ£ls for themselves and posterity. If the ca
lamities in the Weft-Indies have raised the pricc
Â°ffugar that is not to be a fori bed *o government,
and if they pay a little dearer than formerly for
some other articles, that is more than overbalan
ced by a greater plenty of money, introduced by
the operations of government, by the duties it has
laid ojn imported articles of their refpeCtivc trades,
and the spring which it has given to every effort ot
industry. Ought any order of citizens to enjoy
advantages and not contribute to the support ol
government ? Is trade iujuted, or have the laws
of trade or revenue contracted or abridged it ? as
Brutus further implicates. DireCtly the reverse.
The laws of trade, and for the collection of the re
venue, which includes the banks, have extended,
invigorated and improved evcrv thing refpe&ing,
and dependant on navigation. Witness the amount
of our exports; witness the amount of the tonnage oj
American vejfels employed in our coalting and fo
reign trade,which (hews inconteftibly the irtmenfe
fupcriorit vof the present over the pafl. Bur, con
tinues. B'r utus, the regulations of commerce pre
vents the fanner from felling his produce to fo
reigners ; that is, Congress having laid a higher
tonnage on foreign than American vessels, procures
thereby for the latter a preference in the way of
freight. Tf this be a crime in government, to prefer
our own vejfels* who except such as Brutus would
wish to lee it punijhed. Why is it forgotten by
Brutus, that a great pail cf the wealth of the
Dutch, that much of the wealth of the Eng'.ilh has
been accumulated by freights ; and that the envy!
of the Englifti at feeing the Dutch enjoy almost
exclusively this profitable branch of commerce, pro
duced the celebrated navigation ad, under which
our vefTels groan in England, and for which oui
extra tonnage on their vefTels forms no equivalent
reftriCtion. According to Brut us also, the ex
cise prevents the farmer from making ule of his
own labour. Alk the manufacturers of stills,
whether that branch of business has diminished <j
they will tell us that it has increased since the ex
cise law; a sure and certain proof that its opera
tion has opened to the farmer a more extensive de
mand for the produce of his labour. From these
distinCt and independent faCts, it is evident that
general and individual wealth has greatly increased ;
it is evident also, that the augmentation of money,
the facilities to trade, the uniformity of regulati
ons, pervadingthe United States, and ihe eftabliih
ment of manufactures, ail proceeding from the go
vernment, have raised the United States from a
chaos of contradictory laws and regulations, from
a bankruptcy of credit and character, io-a ft*t>on
which her enemns behold with envy, and hit
friends with admiration, and yet Brutus alks.
where are we to look for the advantages gained by
its adoption. Let us pity such men, wlio amidil
such feenr&xan liA_d.iÂ£fuÂ»Â«*eiÂ»*rtJ.

the end. It is too oilen verified to ef,aue obser
vation, that men a-e ceded to public offices,
whom prudent persons would not emrult wÂ»tfi
the management of their individual concernsâfor ,
proof ot this, ler us turn our .attention to
country from. whence the principal part of cur
civil and political inilitutions are derived.-â S'Jy,
do we tneic btl.old men of principle, men of pro

a general opinion in. that country, that every man

fpendthrifts and debauchees, are generally necefii

themselves in their choice ot representatives,they
cannot cxpeCt that their reprefentatires will be
faithful to their infercfts. 44 A good tree will not
bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit." Let every eleCtor there
fore commune with his own heart when about to
give his fuffrageâlet him ferioully enquire whe
ther he would entrult the characters that may be
proposed to his cheice, with the management of
any private business of importance? If he would
not, Jet him withhold his vote from such charac
ters. The want of honest principles is an open-,
door, thro' which every species of fraud and mil
managetnent will enter. It is possible to find a
fufficient number of honest and capable men in,
every community, to appoint as the organs of the
nationâand when that is the cafe, and elcCtions
are free, the people themselves are to blame for
the nufchief consequent on giving thejr fufFrages

Mils Reeves had on Wedncfday evening been
â¡n a short visit to a relation in Coombs's Alley,
which Hie left about eight o'clock, to go home,
alone, and without any thing uncommon having
Â«>ccurred : from that time Hie was not seen Â©j
heard of until early on Thursday morning, when
her body was discovered lying on the mud with
the face down, in the dock near Warder's wharf.
On examining, it was found that the most bru
tal violence had been committed on her person,
and a large wound on the left fide of her mouth,
'and bruises on other parts, that ./lie mult
have fuffered much from the molt fharneful
abuse ; leveral of her teeth were loose. âIt ap
peared, from marks of her feet in the mud, that
ihe had moved several steps from the place where
(he was firft thrown, where her comb and a rib
band were found.
Nothing has yet appeared to detect the vil
lainous perpetrators of this infernal deed, but a
bor declared that he saw two men in a batteau
very early in the morning at the particularfpot
where the body was found, who made off upon
his- approach, and went on board afliallop down
the river.
Miss Reeves was about 17 years old, and ap
prenticed to amantua-maker; and when it is
considered that Ihe bore a very good character,
and was remarkable for her amiable deport
,men't and pleaiing manners, the loss to society
I must be the greater, and excite in the brealts of
(every friend to humanity a detcftation of the
diabolical actor of this horrid tragedy.
Her remains were decently interred on Fri
day afternoon, in St. Peter's Church-yard, at
