SATURDAY, Feb. 5.
The BANK BILL under conji deration.
[Conclusion of Mr. Boitdinot's Speech.~\
BUT even these loans, arising from this paper
medium, with which the market was glutted
were altogether infufficient; and by one change
of circumltances every hope was precluded of
being any ways fuccefsful in procuring money
from that sourceâThe circumstances of indivi
duals too, in this country, are such, when com
pared with the wants of. a nation, as render the
source too vague and uncertain to rely upon, and
it would be a most improvident execution of the
powers granted for the express purpose of the
common defence and general welfare. Private
banks were almost as inadequate to the objetty
and for reasons already given, were neither to
be depended on, for will or capital, as to the
supply for the principal wants of government.
They are generally eftabliihed for commercial
purposes, and on capitals not always fufficient
for them. If they ftiould be prevailed upon at
any time to attempt to supply the demands of a
nation at war, it must be from a general combi-.
nation of their whole flocks, to the dpftrudtion
of the original designs of their several inftiru
tions. This ought not to be expeded, for as far
as it goes to the depreflion of the mercantile in
terests, so far it is injurious to the governmentâ
besides a dependance upon such a combination
! would be impolitic, both from its slowness and
I uncertaintyâThe votes of a few individuals af
fected by local, felfilh, or adverse politics, might
endanger the whole peopleâSuch a dependance
ought not to be attributed to the wife framersof
the constitution, neither does the language war
rant it. But foreign loans have been inentione4
as a proper source for this purpole. The impru
dence of placing the common defence of a na
tion, on the will of thole who have no interpft
in its welfare, is a good answer to this obferya
tion. Would it be prudent to trust a foreigner,
perhaps a rival, if not an enemy, with your sup
ply of what has emphatically been called the
linews of war ? Would it not expose us to exor
bitant demands, 'and often a refufal ? Many ad
ventitious circumltancesâof a warâincreasing
demands from other quarters âscarcity of
and difficulty of communication, as well as the
intrigues of Courts, all loudly oppole the mea
sure, as contrary to the spirit and meaning of a
provision for the common defence and general
welfare. The only resort then, he conceived,
was by a timely provision to secure institutions
at home, from which loans might be obtained at
all times, on moderate terms, and to such amount
as the necefllty of the Hate might require : But
gentlemen fay, that the constitution does not
exprefsty warrant the establishment of such a
corporation. If by expressly, express are
meant, it is agreed that there are no express
words ; and this is the cafe with most of the
powers exercised by Congress ; for if thedo&rine
of neceflary implication is rejedled, be did not
fee what the fupreine legislature of the union
could do in that chara&er. If this power is not
clearly given in the constitution by neceflary im
plication, then is a neceflary end proposed and
directed, while the common and usual neceflary
means to attain that end are refufed, as at
least not granted.
Mr. Boudinot was firtnlyof opinion, that a na
tional bank was the neceflary means, withoat
whichthe end could not be obtained. Theory
proved it so in his opinion, and the experience
of the union in a day of distress, had fully con
firmed the theory. The struggles of the friends
of freedom during the Jlate tonteft, had nearly
been rendered abortivje for want of this aid.â
That danger which was then so hardly avoided,
became a solemn memento to this house, to pro
vide against a similar cafe of neceflityâThis was
the time to do it with advantage, being in such
profound peace. He had not heard any argument by which it was proved that either indivi
duals, private banks, or foreigners, could with
fafety and propriety be depended on as the effi
cient and neceH'ary means for so important apur
pofe. Although money was at present plenty in
Europe, and might be borrowed on ealy terms,
it might not be so to -morrow, in cafe a war should
break out, and our'neceffities become prefling.â
He again enumerated the harmless qualities with
which it was propoftd to veil the bank corpora
tion, by the bill on the. table, for the important
purposes of the common defence and general
weltare". Gentleman had not yet pointed out
any danger to the community, neither did
lie think it wap 'poflible that any could ever be
mentioned equal tothofeof fufFering the govern
ment to depefid upon individuals orprivate banks
for loans, in a day of diftrefi.
But it wai said that this bill gave the corpora-
Jon a right to hold real property in a state,
which Cengrefs had no powers to do. The terms
of the bill are misapprehendedâthis is a right,
which has already been shewn attaches to the ci
tizens individually, or in their aflociated capa
city ; the bill therefore does no more than to
â velt a number with an artificial single capacity,
â under a fictitious name, and by that name to hold
lands, make byc-lavos, See. &c.âall which they
might have done before as citizens in a collec
tive capacity.âSo far from giving a new power,
their original individual rights are limited for
the public fafety as to the amount of their itock
and the duration of their exifteuce.
Mr. Boudinot then proceeded to cite numerous
instances of powers exercifedby Congress during
tlie last two years, deduced under the conftiui
tion by necelfary implication, to (hew the utter
impolfibility ofcarryingany one provision of that
authority into execution for the benefit of the
people, without this reasonable latitude of con
itru<Sion. He alio adverted to some indances of
the like condud: under the former confederation.
It had been urged that rhe newsCongrefs had no
rights or powers but what had been veiled injand
given to them by the individual States, and there
fore they could not accept a cession from Great-
Britain by the treaty of peace of the lands ex
tending to the lake of the woods, because not
before included in any individual State. Every
member was soon convinced of the abfurdjty of
this argument, and by a necessary implication,
eftablilhed the power of the confederated legis
lature. During the war the commander in chief
gave a paflport to a Briti/h officer to tranfinit
cloailiing to the Britifli prisoners at Lancaster.
He accordingly conveyed a very large quantity
of British goods into Pennsylvania for that pur
pose, which being direcftly against an exprel'slaw
of that State, they were seized and condemned
by the proper Magistrate. On a complaint to
the legislature of the State, they referred the
fame to their judicial officers, upon whose report
(that Congress being veiled with the power of
declaring war, the right of giving fafe palfports
to an enemy wasneceflarily implied, which there
fore was duly exercised by their commander in
chief, tho no express power was given to him
for that purpose) the legislature declared their
law directing the condemnation of tfie goods
â¢void ab initio and the judgment of condemnation
had no effect.
This was also the rule that governed this House
with regard to the removability of officers by the
Presidentâand the authority given to a council
to legislate for the weflern territory. In fine he
concltlded, that it was universally understood
that whenever a general power was given, espe
cially to a supreme legislature, every neceflary
means to carry it into execution were neceflarily
included.âThis was the common sense of man
kind, without which it would require a multi
tude of volumes to contain the original powers
of an encreafing government, that mull necef.
farily be changing its relative situation every year
<6f two.
If power was given to raise an army, the mak
ing provision for all the neceflary supplies and
incident charges were included.âlf a navy was
to be formed, the manning and supplying the
Warlike fibres are necellarily underltood.âlf a
power is given to borrow money, a right to mort
gage or pledge the public property to feeure the
re-payment, is underflood to be veiled in the
borrower. Take up the present statute book,
and every page will afford evidence of this doc
trine.-âExamine the law with regard to crimes
and punishments ; under the power of eftablifh
ing*courts, we have implied the power of punifh
ingthe dealing and falfifying the records, and
afceriained the punishment of perjury, bi ibery,
and extortion. Under the power of regulating
trade we have accepted ceflions of real estate, and
built light-houses, piers, &c.âAll this is under
thedocflrine of neceflary implication for the pub
lic good ; and in cases not so flrong as the pre
sent, and on the exercise of which no gentlemen
thought proper to dart this objection.
This conftrucftion appears so natural and ne
ceflary, that the good sense of every gentleman
on the floor, has hitherto led him to proceed on
this principle ever finee we began to legislate :
What principle of the conllitution does it destroy ?
It gives nothing that can affect the rights of any
(late or citizen. Indeed it has been said, that it
is exerciling a high atft of power : He thought it
had been shewn to be rather of the inferior kind
âbut allow the polition, and who so proper as the
legislature of the whole union, to exercise such a
power for the general welfare. It has also been
said, that this power is a mere conveniency for
the purpose of fifcal tranfaclions, bat not neces
sary to attain the ends proposed in the conftitu
tiou. This is denied, and at bell is mere matter
of opinion, and mull be left to the discretion of
the legislature to determine.
Mr. Boudinot laid, he lliould now conclude
what he had to f?y, had not an honorable gentle
man (Mr. Jackson) brought forward the obferva
tious of the author <*f the Federalist, 2 vol. pa. 72
73 and 74, to Ihew a different contemporaneous
exposition of the constitution, and charged the
auchor, who he alledged was said to be also the
author of the present plan before the houfe,with
a change of fentitnent-âAs this gentleman is not
here to speak for himfelf, he ought to have the
next best chance, by having what he then wrote,
candidly attended to, especially as gentlemen al
low him to be good authority.âMr. Boudinot
read only part of the 73d page referred to by
Mr. Jackson, in these words : " Had the conven
' tion attempted a positive enumeration of the
' powers necellary and proper for carrying their
' other powers into effect, the attempt would
' have involved a compleat digest of laws on eve
' ry fubjeft to which the constitution relates :
' accommodated too not only to the existing state
' of things, but to all the polfible ch9nges which
' futurity may produce ; for in every new appli
' ca;ion of a general power, the particular powers,
e which are the means of attaining the general
' power, must always neceflarily vary with that
' object, and be often properly varied whilst the
' object remains the fame.' How these senti
ments can be said to be a different contemporane
ous exposition must be left to the house to deter
mine. Mr. Boudinot then begged the indulgence
of the house to hear the fame gentleman when
arguing expressly on that part of the constitution
now under consideration ; and then read pages
144,5 and 6 of the ift. vol. of the Federalift,which
were too long to be inserted. He declared that
in his opinion it was impracticable to put toge
ther language in the fame length, that could
more forcibly and pointedly elucidate and prove
Ihe construction contended for in support of the
bill on the table. There remained yet but two
objettions, to wich Mr. Boudinot would detain
the house any longer. 1
The gentleman from Geoigia (Mr. Jackson)
had charged the measure with eftabliihing the
commercial interests, to the great injury of the
agricultural. If this was true, he never would
agree to it, for heconfidered the agricultural in
terests of America, as its great and sure depend
ance. Mr. Boudinot confefled that so far from
feeing these measures in this point of light, he
could not bring his mind to comprehend how the
commercial interests of a country could be pro
moted without greatly advancing the interests of
agriculture.âWill the farmer have any tempta
tion to labor, if the surplus of what he raises, be
yond his domellic consumption, is to perish in his
barn, for want of a marketâCan a market be ob
tained without the merchantâlf commerce flou
rifhes the merchants increase, and of course the
demand for the produce of the land ; but if the
merchantile interests fail, there is none to export
the surplus produced by agriculture. If the far
mer lhould undertake to export his own produce,
he could not give his whole attention to his as
fairs ; or if the merchant Jhould attempt to raise
the grain he wanted, he could not carry on his
merchandize. The one interest depends on the
other ; a separation destroys both.
But the incapacity of the bank to extend its in
fluence to the extremes of the union, has been
argued, from the gentleman never having seen a
uoteofthe present Bank of North-America in
Georgia ; he therefore concludes, that bank has
never been of any service to her agricultural in
terests. Mr. Boudinot (aid, that he drew very
different conclusions from this fartâhe supposed
that by means of the bank, the traders with Geor
gia had been enabled to fend her the precious me
tals, while the bank paper had answered their
purposes nearer home, where they circulated with
undoubted credit. He inltanced a cafe, of a Phi
ladelphia merchant, who was poflefled of Â£100
in gold, and Â£iooin credit at the bank ; the mer
chant wanted Â£100 worth of rice of a Georgia
planter, and the like value in flour of a Pennfyl
vania farmer.âWhen he purchased the one of
the Georgian, he could fafelypay him the whole
in gold, while he found the Pennfylvanian would
as readily receive the bank paper for his flour :
But had there been no bank, he could have pur
chased but Â£;o worth of each, and the Georgian
and Pennfylvanian both have gone without a mar
ket for. the residue. In short the whole union
may be likened to the body and limbs ; you can
not aid or comfort one, but the other nntft be
likewise benefited.
786
He said it was however difficult, and imprafti.
cable, to (hew that every measure adopted by the
government, (hould have an effe<sl perfectly equal
over so extensive a government as that ot'the
United States, it was fufficientif, upon the whole
the measures of government taken all together
produced the desired equality.
The lad objection was, that by adopting, tin's
bill weexpofed the measure to be considered and
defeated by the judiciary of the United StaiÂ«,
who might adjudge it to be contrary to the con
lliuition and therefore void, and not lend their
aid to carry it into execution. This, he alledg
ed, gave hi in no uneasiness. He was so far from
controverting this right in the judiciary, that it
was his boaltand his confidence. It led him, he
said, to greater decision on all fubjefts of a con
stitutional nature, when he reflected that if from
inattention, want of precision, or any other de
fect, he Ihould do wrong, that there was a pow
er in the government which could conllitutional
ly prevent the operation of such wrong meafur<
from afFeifting his constituents.âHe was legisla
ting for a nation and for thousands unborn, and
it was the glory of the constitution that there wai
a remedy even for the failures of che supreme le
giflature itfelf.
Upon the whole then, he said, that on taking
the power in question in every point of view and
giving the constitution the fulleft consideration,
under the advantage of having the objciiions
placed in the strongest pointof light by thegreat

Extrail of a letter from Paris, Nov. 2J.
| IWO celebrated Mechanics (Messrs. Per-
A riers) obtained permiflion in 1777, to con
ftrutfl, at their own expence, some fire pumps,
that were to raise and distribute the Seine water
into all the streets of the capital. A co.nfidera
ble sum of money was wanting to form such an
ettablifhment, and Mefl". Perrier's riches consist
ed, at that time, only in calculations ; but con
vinced that their enterprise would prove extreme
ly lucrative, they inspired some of the inhabitants
of Paris with their confidence, and several of the
citizens entered into a society with them, under
the name of Perrier's water company. The fun
damental base of this society was the creation of
1200 fliares of 1200 livres Â£50 (telling each : the
number of these (hares soon encreafed to 400, and
it was at the time, unluckily for the public Trea
sury, that stock-jobbing was very aÂ»Sive about this
eftablilhment. Pompous advertisements, and al
luring proposals, were swarming in every coffee
houfe, and posted up at the Exchange, ana at
the corner of every public street. The cupidity
of speculators was so enticed by such flattering
advantages, that the fliares rose, from their ori
ginal price of T2OO to 4000 livres. This sucCess,
however, was likely to produce a total fall, for
in order to support such marvellous promises,
success must have been certain to the enterprise ;
the public, however absolutely refufed to let the
water into their houses. Every body appeared
alarmed at the expence. The company then, in
order to conciliate once more the favor of the
public, joined to it a Fire-Office for infurnnce,
but the inhabitants of the capital exprefled as lit
tle desire to preserve themselves from fire, as they
did to buy waterâthe stock-jobbers then chang
ed their manoeuvres.âThey were bold and fuc
cefsful enough to add the credit of government
to that of the company, and the money of the
public Treasury to precarious and difcreditecl
(hares. In vain did M. de Mirabeau (the Elder)
publish a severe pamphlet against the enterprise,
and stock-jobbing ; upwards of twenty millions
of livres for the four thousand fliares, which ori
ginally were worth only four millions eight hun
dred thousand livres, and are at present Â°f no
real value. -Not content with this only, Men.
Per riers had influence enough to obtain from the
late Parliament of Paris a sentence, concerted
between them and the company's directors, by
which the said Perriers, were declared creditors
on Government for about two millions of livrtt-
M. de Batz, in the name of the committee of Li
quidations, reported the whole of this infamous
tranfacftion to the Natiorvil Aflembly on Monday
last, and filled the house with aflonifhment an
indignation. He concluded his report with the e
remarkable expreflions : . ,
" It is time the National Aflembly fliould begin
to impress the minds of individuals with a pio
found refpedt for the public weal, and for tie
painful fruits of the people's labor. A line o
demarcation ought certainly to be traced between
the errors of a vicious adminiftxation, and t iefinnnefs of a severe regimen, without which the
payment of the public debt and the re-eltabliih
meiit of the Finances would prove but imagi
nary."
" The National Aflembly decreed " ipfi fafio,
the three following articles."
ift. The Prefidentfliall be requeued to denounce
to his Majesty the Arret concerted between Rlcfl.
Perriers and the directors of the water company,
in order that the interettsof the nation, and of
the public Treasury may not be the fufferers
" 2d. The King lhall be entreated to order,
that all sums belonging to the said company ftiall
be returned, without delay, to the public Trea
furv."
" 3d. The National Aflembly reserve to theiii
felves the power to prosecute the authors, abet
tors, and adherents of all the manoeurves by
which have been extracted from the public Trea
sury the sums mentioned in the report of the
committee of liquidation."
December 31
On Thursday fe'night, during the storm, the
lightning was attracted by ar. iron-bar, which
was fixed as a supporter to the chimney of the
house of Sir James Marriott, judge of the admi
ralty, in Doctors-Commons ; the chimney was
thrown down, and broke through the roof into
the attic story ; which much alarmed the family
as Sir. James lay in a room immediately under
neath ; but fortunately no person was hurt.

INTELLIGENCE FROM FRANCE.
By advices from Paris, of so late a date as the
27th ult. we have the following interesting intel
ligence :
M, de Rochambeau, who, on the alarm spread
of the expecfted invasion of Franqe, from the
north, had been dispatched by the National As
sembly to command the patriotic army, and watch
the motions of the lmperialifts, has issued the fol
lowing inftrurtions to the general officers serving
under him.
" Let the tnoft sacred refped: be paid to all the
decrees fancflioned by the King. As every mili
tary man owes ablolute submission to the Law,
and the King, do not allow the smallest aspersion
to be thrown on their injun<ftions ; re-establish
discipline throughout the whole army ; wait
with refpeftful silence for the military constitu
tion. Every officer who does not think it his du
ty to art in conformity to these inftrudlions, is
liereby at liberty to retire."
The officers of the garrison of Lisle, have at
the playhouse, and other places of public resort,
publicly avowed their contempt for the National
Aflembly, and have gone fofar as to ridicule their
operations ; which seems to indicate, that M. de
Rochambeau will have much employment on his
Lands, as the danger to the revolutioniflrs offuch
a formidable fortrefs being in the interest of the
nobility, &c. is very obvious.
What the Aflembly may have to apprehend
from the discordant and threatning commotions
which prevail to the south of France, may be col
lected from the following articles of intelligence.
A letter froin Aries, in Provence, brings the
dreadful news of thie murder of twenty two per
sons by the mob of that city, and what renders
the crime still more heinous, the rabble were by
no means provoked to it ; whereas at Perpignan
and Aix the aristocratic party went to extreme
lengths, and, in a manner, invited the enraged
multitude to lay violent hands on them.
The magistrates of Lyons are busy in examin
ing the circumstances that attended the conspira
cy lately discovered in that city; every day con
firms its existence, and unveils the molt atroci
ous intentions.
M. Voidel, in the name of the committee of
enquiry, read, on the 23d. in the National Afleni
bly, a letter from the Administrators of the de
partment of the Var ; by which it appears that
some young men conspiring againlt the revoluti
on have allembLed, at Nice ; that they are buy
ing hoi'fes and military furniture ; and that can
non and other warlike Itores arrive daily from
Italy. The letter adds, that the views of the
enemy seem directed against Antibes and Entra
vaux ; and that some of their parties had advan
ced within fight of Antibes ; but finding it well
supplied with artillery, and defended by three
hundred national guards, they had not dared to
hazard an attack. Greater fears are entertained
for Entravaux, where the enemies of the revolu
tion have many partizans. It was decreed, that
the King should be supplicated tofend afudicient
garrison thither.
On the 10th, at Geneva, the people were so
certain of a counter-revolution being attempted,
that fifty louis d'ors were laid to four, that the
king would not be in Paris on the 13th, and in
Savoy it was looked on as a physical certainty.
FRANCE,
VARIOUS circumstances give us reason to be
lieve that a counter-revolution lias been
in agitation, and even planned by the friends
of defpotifin in that kingdom, affiited by such
of the arillocraiic party as were obliged to
fly from the vengeance of their injured country,
and to seek an ignominious Ihelter in foreign
courts. M. de Calonne's publication, On the pre
sent and future flatc of France, evidently announ
ces the existence of such a scheme ; and the au
thor urges the neceflity, and enforces the execu
tion of it, in the ftrongeftand mod preifing man
ner. Count d'Artois, who, for fonie time palt,
has been a voluntary exile at the court of Turin,
is looked up to as the head of this project ; and
great hopes have been entertained that the dif
trefles of the people in France, the natural con
sequence of the changes which have taken place,
would have irritated their minds against their
new rulers, and disposed them to receive favor
ably any proposal made for re-eftabliftiing the an
cient form of the constitution. A sense, how
ever, of their former wretched condition, when
under the despotic sway of petty tyrants, who
abusing the confidence of a good monarch, op
posed his fubjecfls to gratify their private ambi
tion, or to enable them to indulge in ihameful
pleasures ; a thorough convi&ion of the scan
dalous abuses committed, for many years past,
in every department of the State, and a remem
brance of the cruelties exercised against those
whaventured to complain, or to expose the fla
grant villainies of unprincipled minifl/ers ; ltrike
too forcibly on their minds not to make them
tenapious of the liberty they have acquired, >and
which must be permanent, as long as they con
tinue unanimous and firm in that federation which
they have solemnly sworn to maintain. The
miseries of the lower clafles of the people in
France, which have been painted in such gloomy
colours by some, and exaggerated by others,
seem to be in a great degree ideal, and are un
doubtedly not half so bad as they have been re
presented. The ready circulation of the affignats,
which is about to take place, will remedy the
deficiency of specie, *occasioned by the imm'enfe
funis that have been carried from the country by
aristocratic fugitives; commerce will consequent
ly revive, and agriculture be promoted ; while
all ranks, enlivened by the pleasing profpedt of
peace, harmony aÂ«td concord, being restored,
will unite their utmost efforts to preserve these
invaluable blessings. When we fee the eager
ness with which the church property (b'tens na
tionaux) is purchaled, some of it being fold at
more than double its valuation, we mult be con
vinced that true patriotism is too deeply rooted
in the bosoms of the French to be easily extin
gui/hed ; and they consider 110 facrifice too great,
provided they can extricate their country from
the deplorable fituatipn into which it has been
plunged for ages, and transmit freedom and hap
piness to their posterity. The liberty
in France is, therefore, likely to be established
on a solid and lasting foundation, which neither
court intrigues nor despotic' fury, aided by dis
appointed ambition, c!m destroy. But the li
berty, or rather licentioufnefsof the brabant
ers has vanished, " like the baseless fabric of a
vision,". and scarcely "lefta trace behind." De
luded by infatuated demagogues, who had nei
ther abilities nor courage fufficient to carry on an
enterprise which required constancy, persever
ance, coolness and resolution ; and inftigated'to
rebellion by the inflammatory harangues of fa
natical priefls, ever ready to sow sedition, and
who, to encourage their weak followers, walk
ed before them with their religious ir.fignia, as
if inufty relics could have performed miracles,
they have lhared the fate of the frog in the fa
ble, which perished by endeavoring to swell her
pigmy figure to the gigantic size of the ox.

PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION', A
COLLECTION of STATE PAPERS,
INTENDED AS MATERIALS FOR
AN HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OP
AMERICA.
IN this collection will be contained the Char t ens 0 f the
leveial dates which now compose the Union the Recor
of the United Co lonies of New-Engiand ;âRoyal Infiruc'
tions to Colon ia l Gov rr nor s ; âExtr acts from Pl blic
Records ; âand other authentic Documents tending to elucidar,.
our History. " c
The design of this compilation was intimated to Congress and
honored with their approbation.âOn the 20th July, 1778 ' t |â lr
committee, to whom his memorial was referred, reported it a
their " Opinion, that Mr. Hazard's undertaking is laudable and
deserves the-public patronage and encouragement, as being p ro .
duchve of public utility;" Whereupon they " Resolved That
it be recommended to the Governors, Presidents, and Executive
Powers of the several states in the union, to aflift Mr. Hazard nd
give facility to his labors ; and that for this purpose h â  be ad'nnt
ted to an infpeaion of public records, and befui nithed without
expence with copies of such papers as he may judge will conduce
to the valuable end he hath in view.
He was, of consequence, admitted to the infpeftion and use both
of public records, and the collcftions made by individuals from
whence this compilation (much the largest he has ever met' wi-h
onthefubjeft, and, he flatters himfelf, the largest ever made in
America) was formed. It has since met the approbation of many
eminent characters.and even in its manufcrip! state, has facilitated
the fettlcment of fame important controversies.
The compiler cannot suppress the following letter from tlie honor
able the Secretary of State, to whose infpeaion part ofihe com
pilation was submitted, as it contains so flattering and refLcfta
ble a teflimony in favor of the importance of the work.

SIR,
I return you the two volumes of Records, with thanks for the opportu

a multiplication of copies as fiall place them be) ond the reach of accident;
this being the tendency of your undertaking, be ajfured there is iwoneuiht
wijhes it a more complete success than, SIR
