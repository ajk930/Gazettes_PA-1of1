NAVAL ARCHITECTURE,
T \V ETMOt'TH; March I.
LAST Wednesday arrived in this harbour
his Mnjefty's cutter the Trial, commanded
hy Lieut. Malboii. She is-built on an entire new
coull l uOlion, with three Aiding keels, which are
iiiclofed in a cafe or well ; one forward, one
midship, and the other abaft ; they are worked
â¢with the greatest facility, and are not of theleall
inconvenience to the crew when maneuvering
the veflel. She has been universally approved
and admired by all our inoft experienced pro
felfional gentlemen in this place, as well as by
our ingenious ship-builder, Mr. Stephens, and
other mechanics. Her length is 66 feet, breadth
21, her hold f feet only, which, in justice to the
veflel, ought to have been nine at least, and
measures 120 tons. Has a perfeifl flat bottom, on
ly draws 6 feet water, whereas all others of her
tonnage on the old conftruiftion draw 14 ; so that
by such an easy draft of water, lhecan go with
I'afety intoalmolt any harbour or creek whatever.
She fails incomparably fait, either before or up
on a wind ; and though her timbers and planks
seem to be of an immoderate degree of thick
ness (for wh*t reason 1 cannot tell, but which
mull impede her failing) yet no veflel she has
ever been iii/ Company with, of equal size (even
though copper-bottomed, which she is not) has
been able, upon many trials, to beat her in fail
ing, and yet her fails seem too final].
Her hold is divided into several compartments,
all water-tight, and To contrived, that should
even a plank or two dare at sea in different parts
<?f the vellel, (he may afterwards be navigated
with the greatest security to/any part oil" the
â world ; a method hitherto never thought of, be
fore this ingenious i.Hirer contrived it, and which
may be the means of saving thousands of valua
ble lives, and large quantities <>f merchandize
befdes, if ihe (ImoUi be drove on fhoie in a gal<
of wind, fht; dors not become a wreck ; for hei
keels will all naturally be drove tip into thei
cases, and the (hip being then flat bottomed, fix
canWr easily beoverfet, and all the crew may bi
laveÂ® with perfiec't security, by her being abli
to gÂ®))to fuclVvfhallow water.â Ihe crew of thi
IndSaman might all have been saved
had Ihe been thus conftrucfted. These are blef
sings, too obvious to mankind, not to fill ever;
feeling heart with pleasure, and no conunen
need be made on the great good that may be ex
pecfted.
The putch, who arc efteemeda very sagacious
commercial peo >le, liave already adopted this
plan of (liip-building, which at once shews the
utility and advanrage of this wonderful inven
tion.
These discoveries Â«lfo demonstrate plainly,
Jlow far behind hand the art of Ihip-buildiug has
been till this favorable epoch ; and from the in
genuity and mechanical powers of this gentle
man, the art is allonilhingiy improved already,
ami will probably be carried to Itill greater per
fection.
The world is indebted for tliefe noble disco
veries to Johu Schank, ifcj. of Barton houl'e,
Daw lilh, a Captain in the Rojj'al Navy, who hatl
the command of the King's iliips of war'on the
great Lukes of America, in the last war and
accompanied the late ingenious Sir C. Douglafs,
when lie failed to the North Seas, by order ot
Government, to make Iblervations on the Trail-
Ac of Venus.
Itii worthy of remark, that Captain Schank,
with the greatelt liberality and public spirit, has
given up eveiy emolument to his country and
mankind in general, which otlierwife he might
have secured to hintfelf, and which he highly
deserves in (lie greatest degree.
Great merit is due to Lord C. and the prefer)
Lords of the Admiralty, who, getting the beitei
ofall fornrer old prejudices, ordered this vefle
to be conftrntfted. A

LAURA and MARY.
"XTTHY drops the pearly tear fiom Laura's eye?
V V That eye which used the love-lorn mind to cheer ;
Why heaves that boson thus the far-fetch'd sigh ?
What grief afflitts the maid to friendlhip dear I
Fsrm'd with the pow;r the coldest heart to warm,
With innate beauty gbwiftg iri thy breast ;
What from thy boson can contentment charm,
Or break, with momentary woe thy reft ?
Can she whose prefenÂ«Â» never fails to give
New life, new joy, on whom (he deigns to smile [
Thus like a turtle solitary live.
And all admirers of their hopes beguile ? n
" Alas my Mary ! nonght can e'er avail,
1 o sooth the gathered lumuhs of my foul ;
Or, wakening comfort for a girl so frail,
To calm my sorrows, or my griefs control.
Not all the pleasures that this world affords,
Can give one moment to my foul of peace;
Nor all the flattering emptiness of words,
Make glad this conscience with its wonted cafe.
Short are the joys triumphant beauty gives,
With hurried steps full quick they flit away ;
E'en while the triumph in the bosom lives,
We droop with night, and sicken wi.h the day.
But O my Mary ! nought can e'er reprieve
My foul from sorrow, or my bosom che?r ;
Or bless the heart, that fluttering to deceive,
Has ftretch'd my Edward on a watery bier.
Pleased wvth the tho'ts of conquest, and of fame,
I fpurn'd the youth, forgetful of his lave,
Whose crimson blushes spoke the burning flameâ
Hard was my heartânor sighs, nor tears, could move.
At length, dejcfled with my base disdain,
And worn with sorrow, anil corroding care,
He plunged, at midnight, in the billowy main,
And left these fields, and left this vernal air.
*Twasthen I found, nor pride, nor wealth, nor praise,
Could pour one beam of comfort on my mind ;
Twas then I wifh'd, that with an answering grace,
I'd heard his vows, and never been unkind.
Full many an eve I've dew'd the earth
With stern Repentance' biiter-dropping tear ;
7 >an V 3 4ay I've fled Â»he house of mirth*
And brooded o'er the memory of my dear.
Thus, thus, my Mary ! torn from every joy,
And pierced with Conscience' terrifying dart,
In tears, and sighs, my moments I employ,
Nor iears, nor sighs, can ease my broken heart."
Here as (he paused, a sudden thunder shook
The groves around ; the darken'd forefts roar ;
The trees that mantled o'er the winding brook,
Scared at the found, forfook the waved-wafh'd fliore.
Terrific lightning blazing round their heads
In one large (heet the wide-ftretch'd sorest veil'd ;
And new-form'd thunder shook again the meads,
And chafed the lightnings that their forms affail'd.
At once a voice, stern as the winter's roar,
1 hat chill'd their vitals, and that froze their blood ;
Bade the loud grumbling thunder vex no more
The trembling sorest, and the frighten'd flood.
At or.ce a deeper slash o'erfpread the sky ;
A louder peal convulsed the trembling ground ;
The lightnings vanifh'd from the pain-fed eye ;
wavered with a distant found.
Sucfden a form, with which the angelic host,
Nor Raphael's felf in majesty c*uld vie,
Chafed'the dark thunders from the quaking coast,
And oped the purpling regions on their eye.
Then, with a look that pierced thro' Laur a's heart,
And crop'd the withering roses of her cheekâ
11 Thou wretch" he cried, " no comfort I impart;
No joys for thee the fwift-wing'd minutes seek.
He who, with tears, thy favors once implored
Another holds by Hymen's sacred band ;
No more to wander from the nymph adored,
No moie to quit, tor vile disdain, the land.
Content shall bless him in the works of peace,
Fame shall his footftcps in the war attend ;
Rend from a Cefir's brow the withering wreaths
To deck the worthier temples of my friend.
His wife, sweet partner of his every joy,
Adorn'd with all the virtues of the fair,
Shall bless his life in love without alloy,
Love tree from forrowand perplexing care.
Â» In all her looks is sentiment exprefs'd ;
J In every action dignity and grace ;
'iO \ foim'd from every age new praise.to wrestââ¢
1 And scatter bluGieso'er a Portia's face.
She, tinged with health's inimitable dye,
Shall pass the fpringand summer of her life ;
Rife', with a nation's bleflings, to the Iky,
Hei only Epitaphâ 44 This was a Wife."
But thou, (hall (icken with the coming ere;
Drop, unlainented, to the narrow grave ;
No grateful memory to thy kindred leave ;
No hand aflift thee, none (hall wish to save."

Again trefh thunders rock'd the trembling ground {
The vision vanifh'd from her eager eyes,

Published in the Connecticut Courant.
THAT there are many School Mailers in the
country, training up youth in the way ihey
rtiould go, i make no doubrâand hope they will
excuse me if" I complain of fonie others of their
profeifion of quiie a different charaiXerâand
that for these two things.
ill. " In the exercise of government, too
much credulity in admitting the information of
one boy againlt another : Children take a certain
delight in feeing their fellows brought to pu
nishment, which it not so commonly observed
in their riper years : heÂ«ce you will fee a boy
ladling a tree or a port, to get the imaginary
pleasure of being the fcourger of some person :
hence, likewise, they will be fare to fill the mnf
ter's ears with information againlt their mates,
of every thing they suppose will incur his re
lentment, and bring llripes upon them. And
sometimes falfe informations, back'd with falfe
witnefles, will bring punilhmenc, makinga mas
ter rhe instrument of revenge or diver lion to
his scholars. A quotation on this fubjecl from a
letter of a gentleman of veracity, will, I hope,
be excused both by him and the public.
" When 1 was 6 or 7 years old, 1 was in a ve
ry large school, under the tuition of a gentle
man remarkable for his severity ; I was very
finall of my age, and my nerves were strung in
fuel? a manner as that I cut capers with much ac
tivity and nimblenefs, when a Hick four fecc
long cling'd round my little limbs. This was
great diversion to the larger boys, and therefore
they contriv'd to have the affair brought about
once or twice every day. I was daily accused
of playing in school, calling names, or fonie
other fault which I was altogether innocent of.
Ihe accusation would be supported by two or
three large boys, and the reft that knew it to be
falfe, dare not open their mouths. Hence 1 was
whip'd, for a fault 1 never conimutccl, till
I was fore'd to own it, and then whip'd for lv
ing. This was the cafe for so long a course of
time, that I have since wonder'd that my mas
ter, who never saw any thing in me but obedi
ence, with his own eyes, did not suspend his
credulity, and determine, that the diversion of
my accusers, in feeing me cut capers, was the
end of their accusations, But whether he did,
or did not, the practice was continued till I
found there was 110 more beuefir in obedience,
manners or studyâmy fate mult be the fame. So
true to the school was I, that I never mentioned
any thing of my treatment to my parents ; and
my mailer was much carefs'd at our house, as
being a valuable, faithful preceptor. Where ic
would have ended 1 know not (since my discou
ragements produced actual faults, and the ex
ercise of the long Hick was repeated feveraj
times in a day) had not I once had niy little,
raw-bon'd back and ribs smartly .checker'd be
cause 1 was bloody from a great boy's having
run a b'roomtlick into my ear before school be
gan. I was forced then to go into the hands of
a physician, to have the wound heal'd, but seve
ral disadvantages, the consequence of that acci
dent, remain to this day; and yet the malter
was a gentleman offenfe and oflearning, which
shews the danger of credulity, as to complaints
against children under our care. With such a
warning before me, one would have thought
that I thould have avoided it, when acting in
character of school mailer; but 1 confefs, that
1 believe that a droll, half witted, comical, lub
berly boy, who was once my scholar, has been
punilhed upou falfe information given for the
diversion of the school. And indeed we are all
too apt to forget that little children, from their
want of language to convey their ideas, as well
as from the awe they have from the presence of
their mailer, are under an incapacity properly to
defend themselves."
2d. I would complain of a too common disre
gard of the advice implied in my motto, which
is, in short, " to endear theinfelves to their
scholars, and make both school and study de
lightful. (N. B.) If any one lhould fay Ido not
construe right, I will not dispute the matter, as
I am not very expert in translating.) To inspire
the little mortals with a servile fear and awe,
feeins to be the grand point in view with many ;
and I would have authority supported, but easi
ness of excess, and indications of kindness to
wards his pupili is quite as neceflary."âl willagtr on, for the coucl niton of the j:

its powerful influence ; they are at present Co

â with the petit bonnet by day, but they fall
gracefully over the Ihoulders from the dress cap
by night. The reason given by the ladies for
their fondnefs for this article of dress, is by no
means a bad one; it gives them, they fay, an
excellent pretence for shunning all those whom
they do not wish to speak to, and a charming
opportunity of being particular, where they de

her neutrality, that the revenue drawn from
them to the State amounts annually to three mil

Philadelphia, May 28.
By the brig Caledouia, Capt. Hunter, from
Dublin, to New-York, accounts are received from
Ireland to the 7th, and from London to the 3d
of April
The Aflembly at Warsaw, Poland, have de
:lared, in a note to the Bricifh Minister, Mr.
Hailesâthat the Republic would never give up,
on-any condition, the smallest part of its posses
sionsâparticularly Dantzic and Thome. This
resolution was made in consequence of informa
tion received from the Poli/h Minister at Vienna,
reipeiTtiiig certain propositions from the Court of
Berlin. .
Some accounts received by the late arrival at
New-York from Dublin, fay that the profpeft of
a war with Ruflia, has enhanced the price of
linens in Ireland
In (forming Hmael, the Ruffians loft 70oo*men;
in this number were three Major-Generals, one
Brigadier, fix Colonels, forty Lieutenant-Colonels
and Majors, and from 2 to 300 other coinmiflion
ed officers. The life of one fellow-creature, in
the estimation of humanity, is worjJi more than
all the"glory and triumph con^oeft.
By the votes of the two hoYles of Parliament,
it appears that the Britifli government is deter
mined to interpose its power for bringing about
a peace between Rufiia and the Porte. The
armed neutrality, during the last war, affords
the precedent for the warlike preparations now
making in England. How far Catharine willre

Extract of a letter to a Suiedi/h gentleman in this ci-
ty, dated Stockholm, 25th of Nov. 1790,
" Colonel Hceftlko is the only traitor who loft
his head, three other Finland Colonels and Lieu
tenant Colonels were brought out with him to
the place of execution, but obtained the King's
pardon."
On this occasion, a person well acquainted with
the affairs of Sweden, makes the following' re
marks :âThe confutation of Sweden lias lntlch
more regard to personal liberty in some very ca
pital circumstances than the British, or that of
any Monarchy in Europe: Accordingly, the
court before whom the rebellious officers were
tried, proceeded with extraordinary caution,
and did not condemn nlore than a few arch-trai
tors afcer a trial that lalled foine months, and
was laid before the public in a minute detail.
The King, who with heroic fortitude, has " the
milk of human nature" in his veins, would, after
nil, permit only one facrifice to the national se
curity. This lenity might be fatal to hiin and
to Sweden if both were not guarded by a patri
otic and loyal people.
That the people of England should haveacon
ftirution " written on their hearts," is thought
by fonie a novel and unfounded idea. But it
may be asked, should this country ever be so far
cursed as that innovators, in their rage for
change, should annihilate the/orraof theprefent
excellent balanced constitution' of the United
States, would it not be found that the peop]e of
tbii country have the principles of a free constitu
tion written on their hearts? Would they not re
cur to those principles which are immutable, and
indelibly iinprefled on our natures ? They would
âand after ftiffering for a season demagogal ty
ranny, their sober feufes would bring them back
to a government founded on reason, equality and
juflice. Previous to adoptingour present confti
turion, which is nothing more than a definite
and express arrangement of acknowledged prin
ciples, we were in the difgraceful (ituaiiou that
some appear defirons of feeing us again reduced
to âBut it is to be hoped, that the present per
manent position of the federal government, and
the proipetSl of continued tranquility in these
States, are a death-warrant to the hopes of sedi
tion and anarch v.
What are eqr/al rights? This is a term fre
quently made use of, but it is fufpedted with very
different meanings. The constitution of the
United States holds out the belt commentary
upon themâthat has opened the door to genius
and patriotism wherever discoveredâevery citi
zen is eligible to the honor of serving the pub
lic, wbofe merits entitle him to the diltinclionâ
every man is by that constitution fecuied in the
polieffion of his acquisitions, whether of fcientific
or pecuniary property, and consequently secured
in all the advantages and privileges conne&ed
with them. Were this not the cafe, the springs
of industry would be broken, and every fiimnlus
to enrerprize destroyed. Equal rights then ftridt
ly mean, security of property, person and life.
Byrht Betsy, Capt. Howland, arrived in the fror\
the Isle of France, accounts are received which it i; said Aate, that!
the English aimy in India under the command of Gen. Meadows!
has been defe?trd by the forces of Tippo Saib, and that the
General was among th * slain.
The British April Packet, is arrived at Halifax.
It has already been mentioned, that Capt. Jofiah, in the Brig
Brothers, performed the voyage to Canton and back again to this
port, without losing a man by sickness : We are since informed,
that no fpiritous liquors were used on board his fhip~the constant
drink of the (hip's company being Spruce Beer. The follow
ing pertinent remark has been made on the occasion : Twenty
years ago it was considered as Utopian to think of navigating a
velfel without a daily allowance of rum to Tailors, as it now is, to
propose the cultivation of Rice or Sugar without Slaves.
We hear that the ship MafTachufctts, Job Prince, Esq. Com
mander, has been fold in India for Sixty Five Thouiand Dollars :
1 his ship was upwards of 800 tons burthen. The ship Hercules,
upwards of 600 tons, hÂ«is also been fold in that country. Thefc
vefTels were built in MafTachufetts, the former, composed of Ame
rican materials altogether.
Stocks have risen lately a little in New-York.
The Tammany Society, No. I, of New-York, are forming an
extensive Mnfeum in that cityâa considerable collection is already
madeâtheir plan is general, and will have a friendly afpefl on
the naturaland political history of our country 4
We hear that the French 74 at Newport, has on board one of
the regiments lately sent from France, to restore peace in Marti
niqueâand is on her return home : It is rumoured that the peo
ple at Martinique would not fuffer the soldiers to land.
From the eastern papers it appears that a flight shock of an
earthquake was felt on the evening of the 16th inft. in many of
the sea ports extending from the State of New-York to Boston.
Agreeable to the intimation in our last, we learn by a Charles
ton paper, that The President of the United States continued his
tour to the southward, by setting our for Savannah on Monday the
9th inft. He was ef.'orted out. of the city by the Cincinnati, and a
number of other refpeÂ£lable characters.
The Won. Roger Shsrman is ele&ed Senator of the United
Stales for the State of Conne&icut, in tht room of Dr. Johnson,
resigned.
The highest prize in the New-York Lottery was drawn by Capt.
Steddifokd, ofthe late continental army, and Mr. John Utts,
both of New-York.
A correspondent obfcrves, it is a little surprising that no refuta
tion of the innuendo againfl the genuineness of the letter, said to
befrom Lord Mansfield, has appeared since Saturday last : If
the letter is genuine it can be eanly made to appear.
Of the French foreign miniifers it appears from information
communicated to the National AfTembly by M, Montmorin, min
iiler of foreign affairsâ that two only have refufed to take the ci
vic oath, viz. Cardinal de liernis and M. Bombelle, minifler at
Venice, whose places are to be filled by new appointments.
The minister likewilc infoimed the afTembly that the accounts
from the frontiers do not contain iiihgli fact or an alarm-

ONE MORE HINT TO REVIEWERS.
PUNCTUAL, you fee, without the touch upon
My {houlder blade, of .gentle Ba lif's hand,
To your afliftance, here comes honest John,
While sage Inftruttionby his fide doth stand
" Tis a plain, homespun, truth, I know,"
That all mankind are caught by (how ;
That many, who to wit, and sense,
Can have but very small pretcnce,
By caution, and by constant care,
Upon their fellows so impose,
That wisdom Jcems to fill their air,
And science wrinkle up their nose.
On you, my dear Reviewers, let me press
This great, important, and eternal law-
Let naught cntice you error to confefs,
Or own your jndgement can admit a flaw.
But if a Bookoi such a kind appears
That your own ignorance you can't but feel,
Say, that your Readers have both eyes and ears,
And you wij nothing from their pleaiure fleal.
Then, with the liberality of Heaven,
Let copious cxtrafts from the Work be given.

ExtraCl from an Addrcfs to Mr. Burke, in a Lou-
YOU attempt to ridicule the decree of the Na
tional AfTembly, which ordains that the Be
nefices of the Gallican Church (hall hereafter be
Eledive. This however was the uniform prac
tice of the early ages, and is indeed fandtioned
by the authority of the Canons :âeven we, ft:ll
retain the idle ceremony of a Conge d'El'trt, in
the nomination of our vacant Bifhopricksâa
pra&ice that unquestionably may be traced to
this very source.
Pre determined to avow your discontent to the
moll laudable and unexceptionable institutions,
you think by allowing an honorable couipenfa
tion out of the coffers of the State, for the labors
ofthe Clergy, that the new Government of France
has made " a degrading Pensionary Eftablifh
rnent, to which 110 man of liberal ideas will de
(line his children." What a libel upon Religion !
It appears then, that you look upon the I rieji
hood as a mercenary profeflion, to which 110 pru
dent father will apprcut.ce his son, without the
certainty of correspondent emoluments! A refer
ence to Ecclefiaflical History would however in
form you, that the Church never had such able
defenders, nor Chriflianity such celebrated sup
porters, as when the zeal of their common fer
â vants flowed from their voluntary attachment,
and nor their (tipendary labours !
If 1 did not know, Sir, that your condutfl for
some years pad had precluded every idea of
friendfhip, I fhotild have wondered that you had
Dot confulred some person in pofleflion of your
confidence, before your late publication had seen
the light Had you communicated your Manu
script to the learned Author of BellenDenus,
I am sure that, imitating the honed reply of Gil
BLAStntheARCHF!SHOPofGRANADA,he would
have (hook the classical curls of his collegiate wig,
and shrewdly prophecied " that this last Homily
would undo your reputation !
MDE CALONNE, in his celebrated Work,
. (published in England) on the Revolu
tion in France, gives the following melancholy
pitture : ~
" Whatever opinions men may have embraced,
or to whatever party they may be deveted, there
is one point in which the whole world is unhap
pily forced to be unanimous: That the Hate of
France, at the prefenr moment, is infinitely de
plorable, and such as no ingenuous mind can
view without horror. In vain do we attempt to
turn away our eyes from this fpetftacle, and to
fafcinate our imaginations by splendid promises.
The whole power of oratory, the vain found of
emphatic expieffions, avail not to efface the
frightful image of what we fee with our eyes, nor
to extingui<h sentiments which in our hearts we
approve. The King, held in captivity by his
fubje&s, the kingdom abandoned to pillage, the
public power destroyed, justice dumb ana trem
bling, the molt atrocious crimes unpunished, and,
to crown the levies of abominations, innocence
punilhed with juridical formality," &c. &c.

The bridges are to be conftruftcd on the principles of those erect
ed over Charles, Myftick, and Beverly Rivers in the State of MÂ»f
fachufetts, with a draw to admit a free paflTage for velfels with fix
"d (landing mafU, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as shall be determined most con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks oa
each fide of the entrance of such draw, as (hall be judged fufficient:
to aid vessels in parting through. Also, one lamp on each lide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during
the continuance of the lease.
The bridges arc to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, zs fliall render them perfectly substantial and ferure id
the opinion of the commiflTioners, and are to be of a futfkicnt
height to protest them aga'.nft the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to io feet. They
are robe 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for carnage way, eo feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on each fide, 4 feet each, 8
Do. for balluftrades, 1 foot each, Â« feet.
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6incheseach, 1 foot.âTotal, 3! feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong ballultrades,
after the manner of thÂ« bridge between Boston and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept *n constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be furrendcred in good order,
agreeably to the adt.
The following are the terms which the commiflioncrs are au
thor i fed to offer to contraÂ£lors :
A lease of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a per-od not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the pro
sent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an estimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
actual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last part,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will confrquently produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per aim. This may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. ThÂ«
advancing population of the United S'ates, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftruftion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the cafy communiration thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the weflern fide of the Hudson, are >11 important
circumstances, which must necefTarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiffionos are moreover au
thorized bv law to raise four ihoufand pounds to be applied to
wards making caufewavs and laying out proper oar's conne&eA
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purp>feÂ»
As soon as the places shall be determined on where the budge*
are to be fixed, and ihe conrra&s for eiettinj; them aie ex cuted,
the roads and caufewavs will be immediately undertaken*
Such persons therefore as mav be inclined tocontratt on the
principles, will be pica fed to fend in their terms sealed,
within three mon'hs from this date, to William Maxwell,
Esq. in New-York, fpecifying the fhoru-ft period ol lease for
which thev will undertake to erett the said bridges,together with
proper security for performing the fame.
