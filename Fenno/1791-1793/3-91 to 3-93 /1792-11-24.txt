IV was my intention to have closed with
-I my lad paper, the difcufiion of Mr. Tc:fer
fon's conduct in the particulars which have
been suggested ; but the lingular complexion
of the last of a series of papers ori
ginating tn the American Daily Advertiser,
obliges me to resume it.
As it bold aflertion were capable of impos
ing any thing for truth, an attempt is made
in the paper alluded to, to impress the follow
ing opinions, id. That the extract which was
given of Mr. Jefferfon's letter on the ''Ã¼bjeft
of a proportion for the transfer of the French
debt, is " falfe," " deceptive," and " muti
lated." Thefearethe epithets in different
pauages applied to it. 2d, That Mr. feffer
fon was the mere vehicle, or to use the pre
cise terms, " only the vehicle of communica
tion to Congress." 3d, That he Â« dilcounte
nimced" the proportion. 4th, That, the "on
ly' proposition which he made to Congress
was to borrow the money in HoJfand to dis
charge the debt.
To give colour to these aflertions, I am
called upon to produce the entire paragraph
y It,;c extract has been made, and it
is suggested, that the whole was deposited in
the quarter, from whence the extract is be
lieved to been taken.
I pledge my veracity that this suggestion is
unfounded ; as is anotherâthat the informa
tion *ljjch has been communicated by me is
derived from the opportunities of official situ
ation. I affirm unequivocally, that I obtain
ed through different channels a full knowledge
of the tranfaaior, i â¡ February, 1787 âbeing
in 110 public station whateverâthat I ther>
saw the extract, which has been publilhed,
and which was at that time taken from the
original letter, and has been since preserved,
in the mod: authentic formâThat I then al
so received information equally authentic of
the general substance of the letter, as relating
to the matter in queiliou, and of all other per
ticulars concerning it, which have heretofore
been ftatea, and which have been prefetved,
in a manner, that admits no doubt of their ac
curacy or genuineness.
For this, I again appeal to the letter itfelf,
on the flies of the department of state, where
aborts, as far as I am informed, its entire con
tents are tfepofited, and which I entertain no
doubt will conliim not only the truth of the
extract which has been but thejuftnefs
of the representation of the contents of the
letter in all other sefpefts.
Canfidsring th? extraftas genuine, which un
doubtedly it is, it speaks for itfelfâand une
quivocally falfifies the fugreftion that Mr.
Jefterfor) was " only the vtkidt" of communi
cation to Congrefsâlt impsgfc without the
pofllbility of evalion, advice toWGde to thepro
pofition which was made to the Dutca Com
pany, on the dilhonorable ground of there be
ing danger, that the public payments would
nor be punctual, and of its being in that cafe ex
pedient to traiiijer the d'ftontevti, which would
arise from the want of punftualitv, from the
court of France, to the breajls of a irivate compa
nyâlt therefore clearly maizes hi'm more than
the mere vehicle of communicationâthe pa
tron and adviser of the rneafure upon the con
dition which has been Hated It as clearlv
refutes the aftoni/liing aflerti.w, that he "dif-
the proportion j whatever
fubterfuge may be brought to colour itâAnd
it equally deftrovs the other allegation, that
the only proposition which Mr. Jeiferfon made
to Congress, was to borrow the money in Hol
land to discharge the debt.
It has been admitted, that there was ano
ther proportion, in the fame letter, of that
import; but it is denied under the appeal
which has been made, that it in any manner
derogates from the advice contained in the
extract.âlt is underitood to have been offer
ed as an alternative ; in cafe the proportion
of the Dutch Company {hould not be approved
âAs another mods? which might be adopted t(#
effect the payment to France.
It wiJJ be remarked by an attentive read

" Everyman is born with no (mall propen

naturally a delight in indolence ; consequent
ly every man ir. for having the *noncy, wives
or daughters of others; would fubj.-ct them

what only pleased himfelf. We may fee that

as irupoiSble as that two preachers, or two

" Mankind, in the present state, 'cannot
subsist, nnlefs an infinity of ufeful mcnÂ«liave

if you are in want of a pair ot' /hoes, youmuft
find some other hand than a fcijeant at law or
a judge advocate, to make them for yotiÂ»
Thus inequality is, at the fame time, both
the most natural and the mod chimerical
thing in the ivorid.
" Men beingexceffive in every thing where
they can bs so; this inequality has been carri

standing maxiqi, that a citizen is not allowed
to quit the country where he happened to be
born : the import of such a law is visibly this :
the country is fa bad nod ill governed, tint we forbid
anjptrfoni whatever to go out, left every body should
have itâA good government will ast more
wifely â¢ it will create in its fubjefts a delight
to remain ; in foreigners, a desire of cominr

BOIfSF OF RF.PFF.SENTAI7VFS.
Man Jay, September 19.
The henfe went . â¢ a committee of the
whole, Mr. LawraC in the chair, on the
Prtainent's
On that r 1 i t \. 1. '<* relates to the reduction ot
the publi dÂ«bf, T"v.r. VitMimons offered a refo
lunon ro the to tawing purport : â
Refold ;1, - the opinion of this committee,
that for the reduction of so much of
â the r-.t-r'.ij debt as the United Suites have a npht
o redeem, ought to he adopted. And that the
iccretafy the treasury be directed to report a
plan for that purpose.
Mr. Madifoil wiihed for information before
he couldagreeto the.motion just made. Theexact
fiate of our finances he conceived neceflary to
be well known before measures were taken for
the reJu&ion of the debt. The house of repre
fentati- es had already unequivocally expressed
their general sentiments 011 the fubjedV, in their
anfwerto t&e President's speech; but it was not
time, he conceived, for the adoption of mea
sures with a view to realize what appeared the
general wish, until the information on which
those measures were to be grounded, was re
tived
Mr. Fitzfimons argued, that the motion, if
adopted, would call forth the information neces
sary to ground a final measure upon. The re
commendation from the President >vas strong,
and the anfwerof the house as pofitiv<;; no de
ference of opinion, he therefore supposed, could
cxift as to the propriety of reducing the debt.
The United States had paid a valuable, consi
deration for the right of reducing it, and the
firft opportunity of making use of that right, he
conceived the best.
Mr. Williamfon was of opinion, that infor
mation would come in of course. The Presi
dent, .he fuggeflcd, 110 doubt was acquainted
with the firuation of the revenue when he re â¢
commended the reduction oi the debt at the
present time. He fliould be in favour of the mo
tion. He declared it as his opinion, that our
public debt was our moll dangerous enemy ; he
wished it could be reduced twice as fa ft ; the ir
redeemable quality of part of it he much dis
liked.
Mr. Madison again expreffcd it as his opini
on, that information ftiould form the basis of
any provision for the redu&ion of the debt. If
the motion was carried, information no doubt
could be obtained before the final adoption of
any measure ; but he insisted on the necessity of
making that information the groundwork of any
proceeding on so important a fubjevSt
Mr. Mercer, No question, he conceived, was
of more importance than that involved in the
motion before the house. He wiftied for time
to make up his mind on i . It involved one ques
tion which had occafisned very warm debate in
the house, and which was decided but by a small
majorityâhe alluded to the reference madÂ«
la'.l fellion to the secretary of the treasury.
He conceived it improper to commit to any
man, what he was bound himfelf to do. He con
ceived the power of the house to originate plans
of finance, to lay new burthens on the people
entrusted to them by their conftituei}ts, as in
communicable.
As to the main objeA of the motion, he ra
ther doubted the propriety of adopting, at pre
sent, a permanent system for the redu&ion of
the public debt.
The noufe, he said, ftcod in a very delicate
fituatlonâa fuller representation will shortly
succeed the prel'ent. He saw a propriety in
making a temporary provision to redeem, in or
der to lecure the right of reducing - in future.
He hoped the house would consent to a delay of
a day or two, when members would be better
prepare d.
Mr. Smith, S. C. conceived, that, as the mo
tion had been made alid seconded, some decision
raufl be obtained on it, or that the committee
must rife, He saw no good realon for leaving it
to afiture house, to adopt a permanent plan of
reduction. If it was now thought too early a
period to accomplilh l'o dt-firnbte an obje<sl, it
would be a good reason for deferring it; but if
it was full time, meafuresfor that purpose (honld
be adopted, they should go forward. Iftlie gen
tleman required further time to make up his
mind, the committee might rife and fit again in
a day or two.
He next made some reply to the objedionsof
the gentleman last up, to that part of the mo
tion which contemplated a reference to the se
cretary of the treasury. The ultimate decision,
he remarked, in no one point, was relinquished
by such a reference. If such a reference was un
conllitutional, he observed, much business had
been conduced in the house in an unconflitu
tioiial manner, by repeated references to the
Jttacis of departments. The reference of btffinefs
to feled committees would be unconstitution
al, he laid, on the fame ground.
Turning oil ihe main questionâthe house,
he conceived, were in poffefijon of informatiin
already, that wculd warrant a beginning in the
work of reducing the public debt. From the re
port of the trulrees of the finking fund, lead in
the morning, it appeared, that they had funds
remaining in tbeir hands.
' house rad pledged themselves in their an
swer to the PrcfiJcrit's addrefj, to proceed on
the ti' if-; now to refer the bufinrfi to a future
Congr.rl . would appear like great relnftance to
j'O i T 'tot\e meaiure, and wo p. id argue great un
ite*(!. i: â !i. Ihe f\ flem to he adopted for the
purpw'e contem; could not, he conceived,
b. attempted, in the firA uiftance, info Urge a
body , s a committee of the whole house. He
hopt. the pueftion rn the motion would obtain
a decide :it the present time; but if thegentle
n.an perfiiled in refuelling a delay, he wilhed
the committee to rife and alk leave to lit aÂ°ain.
Mr. Sedgwick coareived, the house duf not
need any more information than they were in
pofTciTxdn of, to fee 'the propriety of adopting
immediate ineafuresfor the redu&ion of the debt.
The United States, it was evident, he said,
are paying more than the market interest upon
their debtâit fells above par, and, considering
the rate at which loans can he obtained in Eu
rope 011 the credit of the United States, that
mode of reducing the deb' was, he said, incon
trovcrtibly eligible. It would be economical for
an individual, in similar circumstances, to cffe&
a reduction, and the cafe waÂ» the fame, the U
nited States being in the place of that individual.
It was agreed to in the house, he f.iid, and re
echoed out of doors, that a public debt was a
public evil; it was the duty, therefore, of the
representative* of the people, to use all the
means in their power, whenever opportunity
offjred, to reduce it.
He made some observations on the propriety
of referring the business to the secretary for in
formation and his opinion, and concluded by de
claring, that, viewing the main question as he
firfl dated, he could not fee any neceflity in de
ferring a question on the motion.
Mr. Mercer expressed some surprise at the
disinclination some gentlemen appeared to {hew
to a full difcufiion on so important a lubje&. He
again obfe&ed to a reference. That mode of
conducing business in the house, he said, had
p-iven very general diffatisfa&ion. The mode
was adopted by a small majorityâthe hcufe had
received, since its aaoption, an acceflion of new
memkersâbeiides, since, every member had mix
ed with his conftituentSj and opinions might
consequently have varied since that tin I .Â®. For
his part, he said, he,ftiould pay great and im
plicit regard t<Â» the opinion of his constituents.
He again adverted to the nature c>f the trust
reposed in the house by the conftitmion, in ori
ginating money hills, See. and dwelt on the
true import of the word originate, which he
conceived could not be explained away, so as to
warrant a reference. Besides, he argued, is not
a body fetched from millions of the people,
more adequate to the talk of originating., than
a single man.
He hoped, that refpeft to the frefident's re
commendation would never make the house in
attentive to the great interests of the people.
The President's address had not been so long
before the house, as that a Ihort delay fnould ar
gue difrefpeiffc.
But the President, in his address, did not, he
said, recommend a reference to the secretary.
He was willing to give a decision on the firft
part of the motionâthough he would pi sfer a
delay of a day or two; if this, however, was
not granted, he fhouU call, he said, for adivi
fion of the queirion,
He again adverted to the propriety < f taking
advantage of the redeemable quality of our deb.t
as soon as poflible; observing that the next term
of payment of interest came round with the new
year.
Mr. Fkzumons observed that he was in the
minority on the question adverted to by the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mercer) â
that he had not since altered his opinion upon
that fubji A, but eonfidered tke present reference
as very different from the former, and entirely
within the letter and spirit of the a <51 for eftab
lifliing the treasury department. He did not
believe it would be n ceffary to impose addition
al burdens, to effeA a reduction Â©f the debt.
He believed that the existing finances, aflifted
by a foreign loan, would enable the United
States to accomplish the objed;.
As to the reports from the treasury or other
officers, âthey will Hand 011 their own merits.
If they are bad, they will be rejected.
Mr. Mkdifo'e drew a diftin&ion between the
deliberative functions of the house and the mi
nifterul functions of the Executive Powers. The
deliberative functions, he conceived, Ihould be
firftexercilcd before the miniflerial began tÂ«a&.
It should be decided by the house, in the firft in
stance, he conceived, whether the debt should
be reduced by iniponng new taxes, or by varying
the burdens, or by new loans. The fundamen
tal principles of any nieafure he was of opinion,
should be decided in the house, perhaps even be
fore * reference to a felecÃ: committee. He did
not pretend to determine whether the motion
now before the house might not involve a refer
ence of a ministerial nature merely. But he well
knew, he said, that the aÂ«sl eltablifliing the Trea
sury depaitment had beep so construed as to
give it a greater latitude than was contempla
ted when the lawpatted,muchagainft the opinion
of a great portion of the people. In the infancy
of our government, that latitude, perhaps might
be neccffary; but he saw no ncceiftty for it at
present. w
Mr. Fage eppofed a division of the question
as precluding debate. He wished the motion a
mended, by striking out the last part.
Mr. Findley was against a reference to the Se
cretary of the Treasury of a matter, which, he
conceived, was made the exclusive business of the
house by the constitution.
Mr. Mercer expressed himfclf in favour of
striking out the lafl part of the motion.
Mr. Hiilhoufe waÂ» of a different opinion. HÂ«
conflituents, he conceived, expected their busi
ness to be done in the bell manner pofTible, and
that he Ihould not rely on his own information
only, but endeavour to avail himfelf of the in
formation of others, He said he Ihould consider
himfelf unequal to the talk of taking a (hare in
legislating for the Union if he was to depend 011
his own information alone. He expeifted to de
rive information from every lource. It was the
intention of meeting in Congreli to <olleÂ£t in
foi mation from every quarter.
He ftiould defpile any one, he iaid, he
Ihould defpile himfelf if he thought his judg
ment could be ire properly influencedby aHyplan
reported by any of the heads of department. If
any fyfttrm, originating \Â»ith the head of a de
partment appeared the bed that could be devised
it fht-uld meet the sppiobation of the house ; but
if any amendment was thought of, it was the
duty of tt e houle Â£0 adopt or reject it according
to its merits.
202
He considered reports In the light of informa
tion, and dwelt on the necessity of receiving in
formation, from every quarter. He was against
ftnking out.
Mr. Find ley was in favour of ft risking out.
He was a friend to information, he said, but the
reports from heads of departments lie did not
consider in the light of information merely. It
was information, and plans built on that, and
those plans supported by arguments.
Though a law, he said, had made it the pro
vince of the Secretary of the Treasury to repprt
tl ofe plans ; âthe conflitution had not enjoined
the house to refer; and he hoped the house, be
ing the masters of their own proceedings, would
originate such measures themselves.
The house had aright to, and, he conceived
ftiould call for what information was wanted to
enable them to digest their own plans.
Mr. Murray observed, that the debate on the
propriety of referring to the Secretary of the
Treasury the business contemplated in the mo
tion, had produced but few new arguments ; it
was a repetition of what was said when the fub
jcA was before the house at another time.
One new idea, however, he observed, had fal
len from the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Ma
dilon) viz. his diftin&ion between deliberative
and ministerial fun&ions. This diflin&ion, he
conceived, is qualified by the nature of things.
It i- qualified in this instance, by the law
which establishes the Treasury department, That
law makes it the duty of the Secretary, to'digeft
and report plans to ameliorate our finances,with
out any call from the house. True the business
of the house is to deliberate ;but by references,
naither is the power of the house to deliberate
infringed, nor does it give the Secretary a right
legislatively to deliberate, but to deliberate mi
nisterially; and it was important, he conceived,
in a government framed like ours that such offi
cers (hould have the power to deliberate in that
manner. The result of their deliberations was
not obligatory on the house, âno further than it
was warranted by wifdem.
He was averse to striking out âwas willing
to allow further time for confederation. He
should like to fee, for his own part, a statement
of the revenue.
He again expressed it as his firm opinion, that
a report from the head of a department could no
further influence the house, than by the weight
of ths wisdom it contained.
Whenevtr ministerial influence, he observed,
was felt in the house, othenvife than by weight
of wisdom, it would but little matter, he concei
ved, whether Secretaries had it in their power to
report plans or not. Reports, he conceived,
would never have an improper influence, as long
as the legislature preserved their character for
wisdom and integrity.
The information to be derived from the head
of a department, could never, he suggested, be
\obtained in a more proper manner, than by mak
ing it the foundation of deliberation. Suppoling
the house should undertake to originate without
this previous step, and a difficulty should occur
for want of information ; it would be he concei
ved, derogatory to the dignity of the house to
appiy then to the Secretary for afliftante, and
more dangerous to proceed in error or ig-
Jiorance.
He rather wished for a fliort delay ; âbut if
the question was urged, he lhould certainly vote,
he said, against ftrikingout.
Mr. Madison saw some difficulty in drawing
the exa<sl line between fubjeibof legillative and
miniftei ial deliberations; but llill I'uch a line
tnoft certainly existed. Gentlemen v;ho ar
gued the propriety of calling t>n the Secreta
ry for information, plans and proportion*, in
volved the propriety of permitting that oHicer
in the shape of a plan or measure to propose a
new tax, and lay whether it should be a dired:
or indirect one. Yet, if it wns proposed directly
to give this power to the Secretary, few mem
bers, ke believed, would agree to it. He was in
favour of striking out.
Mr. Gerry said, that while the law eftablifli
injj thÂ£ Trtafury department was under conside
ration, he had opposed that part of the bill which
gave the Secrtiiiy power propoue to the liouie
a tax and a plan to carry it into execution. He
conceived such a powei; contrary to the princi
ples of the constitution. This power i* however,
involved in that part of the law which autho
rizes him to propose, without being called on,
plans for the lupport of credit, for the redu&ion
of the publie debt,&c. The Secretary, neverthe-
knowing probably, that that power, grant
ed him by the law, was looked upon with & jea
lous eye by many members of the house, has ne
ver exercificd it.
He, however, was not averse to referring the
obje& of the motion to the Secretary. lie law
an impofiibility, if taken up in a committee of
the whole, in rendering the intended measure
an uniform part of the gntat financial whole.
The clashing of varioas opinions would prevent
it.
If the influence of the Secretary was formi
dable he conceived, it would be much more
dangerous if exerted againfl a ft:le& committee,
than in the whole house.
He hoped the last part of the resolution would
not be struck out.
On motion Â»-be committee rofr, repprted pro
grcfs and aiked leave to fit again.
House adjourned.
Sketch of the Observations ivh'ub ivere made on
MR. Murray'S Motion,
That a Committee be appointed to bring in a
Bilifupplementary to the Militia Law
pafled the last feflion.
Mr. Liveririore rose to enquire, what parti
cular part of the law, was the objed of the re
solution?
Mr. Murray explained; he informed the house
that it had special reference to the clause which
refpe&s arming the militia. He said, the injunc
tions of the law, in this particular, imposed c
qual burthens, on Ihoulders infinitely difpropor
tioned as to their capacity i,o sustain them : it
duties en the major part of the mfiin.
ci such a nature, as renders the iaw totall? un*
practicable. A man not worth one fartlunp, iâ
iubjc&ed to the fame expence with one who msy
be worth ten thouiknd pounds a year: the ine
quality, evident in the operation of such a requi
fitioii, is a plaring infiance of injustice, and calls
Â«idly for legislative interposition and relief.
adverted* to the paiticular lituation of the
Oate of Maryland, to !'ic\v the imprÂ»6ticÂ»bilitT
of carrying the law into exception in that part
of the Ur.ini!.
Mr. Will:, mfon si e.>cl'Â»r 1 an alteration in the
rtfotution. Ii Would be better, in his opinion,
to have it read, a bill to amend the militia law.
He moved for this alteration.âMr. WJlliamfon
ohferved, that he thought the law fufeptiblc of
ftveral amendments; but with refp-c; to the ob
jection of the gentleman from Maryland, he said
it npplied with equal force to many other partÂ»
of the law, particularly with regard to the gen
eral performance of militia duty.
Mr. Livermore stated fonie obje&ioni to the
indefitenefs of the resolution.
Mr. Greenup ohferved, that he had fecondcd
the motion of the gentleman from Maryland,
because he thought many parts of the law might
be amended in fucli manner, as to make it more
applicable to ths circumlUnces of the state of
Kentucky; which, from its peculiar situation,
could not derive those advantages from the law,
which other parts of the Union might; the want
of which were l'enfibly felt. He preferred adopt
ing the words to amend, in lieu of ' fupplemeil
lary.'
Mr. Hillhoufe objeÂ«sled to the motion: he
thought that competent relief, in the cafe com
plained of, might be obtained from tke state le
gislature. He added, that the law had fcarcÂ»ly
got into operation; some of the Rates have made
provision to carry it into execution; others are
about doing the fame: and he doubted the poli
cy, exceedingly, of taking any lltps in the bufi
ncls, before any experience of the law hail been
had.
Mr. Fitzfimons offered some remarks of a si-
milar nature.
Mr. Mercer supported the Motion. He or.
ged a variety of reasons, to (hew the importance
of taking immediate measures to amend and Â»
meliorate the law: if thii is not don*, faidhe,
it will fan&ion the idea, already entertained by
many of the refpe&afcle citizens of the Union,
that there is a disinclination, on the part of ma
ny members of the legislature, to provide for an
ufFedtive militiaâthat a neceflity may be indu*
ced for a (landing army. He adverted to the
injufticc of the requisition, which enjoins, that
a man who is not worth twenty (hillings, ftiould
incur an expence of twenty pounds, fti equip
ping himfelf as a militia man.
Mr. Murray's motion, for a committee, was
negatived; fourteen members, only, rising in
the affirmative.
IVednefday, November 21.
The petition of John Sinclair
others was read, praying a settlement M
their accounts for public servicesâLaid
on the table.
Mr. Lee moved for the order of the
day on the fubjeÂ£t of loft certificates.â
This motion was w ayed, to take into con-
the report of the Committee of
the whole on the Prefidcntfs speech. The
several relolutions agreed to by the com
mittee were read,-; but the house being
thin their consideration was deferred.
Mr. Murray called for the resolution which
he laid on the table yesterday, " that a com
mittee be appointed to repeal that clause of
the militia Jaw which relates to the arming
the milita t: is being read,
Mr. Murray said he ilill bad hopes, though
hir. iirft motion the day before had failed.â
The present motion was to repeal the clause
which he hoped to prove obnoxiou^âas it
â¢was more limited than the former oneâand
as he did not mean by this to Â£o into a general
revilion of the whole law, out confine the re
pca> and fnbftitute to the arming claufe,he ima*
gined many gentlemen Would frpport his in
tentions, who yesterday were averse to open
ing the whole law to revision. The clause in
question was obnoxious to his constituents âa
late and most intimate knowledge of his dif
tr"usl had enabled him with great confidence
to fay so ; and he had reason to believe that
unlets an alteration in the law took place, no
a6t of the legislature of Maryland would give
it the desired operatien in fhat llatc. The
clause was difagrceable to his constituents,
becanfe it was oppreflive in principle, and im
practicable in its operation. It was a princi
p'e of political justice which no occasion couid
dispense with, that prote&ion and taxation
should be commensurate* That wherever a
ta'x was levy'd for the protection of fodct},
its apportionment among individuals should
be as exa<stly as polTibls porrefpondent with
tlfe property of each individual. There is Â«*
much justice in this, that he did notJnppo.e it
would be controverted. The opprcilion t. at
will be felt in the operation of this clau.e,
flows from the violation of that princip c.
The obligation to arm in a particular man
ner, as it vill produce a uniform expence on
men of unequal property, m ill prove a tax
that will ast unjustly, becai.fe unequallyâ
m~n will not pay agreeably so their propei ty.
To illustrate this iseafy, and the plaineftmode
of the truth. By the law, he who s
past his forty-fifth vear, is exempt from mi
litia duty. It mull: often happen that men
of large fortune will thus contribute nothins
toward- thi species of ftfotrftion, v.mle the
man of very fmali fortune will be obl-.ged to
futnifli largelyto if, if the father of a family
capable and of age to hear anus, lor tne
fake of harmonv ai d a ready clifpriitwn to fall
into a patriotic impul'e, he much doubted
whether his constituents povM have mur
mured much at the violation ot the principal
%
â¢#bat tlie impracticability of this clause obliges
them to leek relief through their repre.'enta
tives- Tl|C ' t!ie diftri<ft be came from,
he much feared couki not be executed. Each
mjlitia-niaq is to tome into the field with a
jnulket, or firelock, a bayonet,, cartoucli-box,
and Otfcer equipment";. Thcle, he verily be
lieved, could not be had. If the citizens, even
tboi'e who would think lightly of the burthen,
could not procure thole accoutrements, the
law must be violated. Congress, he hoped,
would uot force his well inclined fellow citi
zens to violate the lawâbut if the law could
âot polfibly be executed because impraaica
b e the legislature would be answerable for
the'indignities it brought upon itfelf, t>) thus
nrefcribms unneccffary hardftiips. .It was
then to Ihield Copgrefs and the dignity of ie
gillation from the lharne of imposing impollible
obligations, as well as to redress the citizen,
that he wilhed the claule altered.âSeveral
modes presented thernfelvesâThe most obvi
ous is, the furnilhing of the arms at the pub
iic expenceâand another is, the furnilliing
of the arnrs to fuclr as might in the opinion of
certain officers be too poor conveniently to
find tliem. Congress might leave it with ei
ther the officers of the militia, or with tne
deputy marffials. The disposition once felt
to relieve, would prelentlydefignate its mode
of accolnpliffiing redrels. Fines too would
prove a perpetually accumulating fund,which
could in a few years either be applied to the
further purchase of arms, and further exone
ration of the poorer class, who might rot fall
within the idea of the most rigid poverty âor,
to a reimburleir.ent of the public for the arms
firft purchased. At all events, it could do no
liarin to hear what a committee could report
en this fuhjeflâand when the house reflected
that this was the wifli of a populous diftria,
and he verily believed ,of the whole state of
Maryland, he did not doubt of at least.a sober
regard to f'uch claims. A matter of great
importance it certainly was, that as far is
confident with the good of the whole, the
interests and wiflies of a part (hould be at
tended toâin this cafe, his constituents ar
gued from impartial views or local motives,
but from the fundamental principles of pro
perty & taxation,equally applicable to allwho
thought thernfelves aggrieved. He was con
vinced the clause in question was as imprac
ticable as it was oppreflive, and he hoped to
have a committee appointed. He felt, that
whatever might be the event, he had dis
charged the dutj he owed his fellow citizens,
and obeyed his own opinions.
Mr. Williamfon strongly reprobated the
idea of making the arming of the militia
a public expence, as involving a most un
equal and oppreflive species of taxation,
tfpecially as it is conceded that more
than one hnlf of the militia are already
armed.
Mr. Kittera said he was opposed to the
nwioa; by a calculation which he offered,
he said the expence of arming the militia
Â« the public charge would amount to 42
millions i.f dollars, rating the expence at
Â£.10 per man, according to the estimate
of a gentleman from Maryland.âHe re
probated the idea of making any alterati -
on in thelaw bfcfoie any experience of its
effects had taken place.
Mr. Mercer supported the estimate he
had made of the individual experice ; and
if it amounted said he, as the gentleman
from Pennsylvania has said, to 42 millions
of dollars, was the expence leflened by its
being imposed in the most unequal aui
oppreflive manner ? He said he never had
any idea of the goveinments incurring
fucli an expenge~he had no conception
of the policy of a militia amounting to
750,000 men- he never wished to fee a
militia which should exceed thirty thou
sand ; the plan of armirg such an immense
niafa of militia .was, in his opinion, the
molt gbfurd idea that could be imagined,
and Stnoiwted to a relinquifhmeuc of all
hope of an cffkient'militia.
Mr. Page was opposed to the motion,
It objected panitulai-ly to Mr. Mercer's
idea of arming so small a part of t|\e mi
litia, andpointed outthe
would naturally take place in consequence
of different principles being adopted in
refpedi to the arming the militia. He
remarked that the difficulties which had
presented themselves in the former difcuf
iion of this butinefs 110'vv occurred in full
01ce , and would involve the house in all
ptiplexities which had he; ttofore at
tended the buiinefs.
Mr. Dayton made a few remarks on the
motionâne was opposed to itâand reprobated
in strong terms any plan of'arming tie mili
tia. >vhicli fiionkl give either t\ estate or ge
neral government a right to dispossess them
tr.e'ir arms on' any oecafion.

Henry Miller, John Wilkins, jun. Robert
Coleman, Thomas Bull, Cornelius Coxe, Ro
bert Johnfton, John Boyd, David Stewart,
George Latimer, Hugh Lloyd, James Morris,
and Robert Hare, are duly elected and chosen

the United States, to serve at the election in
that behalf to be held, at Harrifburgb, in the
county of Dauphin, on the firfl Wednesday of
December next, agreeably to the ast of Con
gress, and the ast of the General Alfembly of
this commonwealth, in such cafe made and
provided.
By ths latest accouHts from Georgia, re
ceived from Mr. Seagrove, Agent for Indian
affairs in the southern department, it appears
that the Chiefs of the Creek nation are not
unfriendly to any part of the United Statesâ
On the contrary, Mr. Seagrove fays he has
reason to tiiink it is the wifli of nine tenths
of that nation to be in ft rift friend fliip with
11 's. And all danger of an interruption of the
harmony, arises from the reiblefs and vicious
disposition of feme of the white people among
us.

COMMU NICATIONS,
The accusation against the Vice-President
shews a ilifpofuioi; to make him appear un
worthy of the office he now holds, as well as
of the confidence and refpeft of His fellow
citizens which he has long held; âIt is no
small compliment paid him by his enemies,
that they can find nothing against lii;n but his
opinions. . His life is unbleutiihed; Ms cou
dodt manly and Gncerc âhe has not, lixe most
popularity seekers, hid himftlf from his coun
trymen-n-A cunning ambitious man ir.lteaa
of broaching nnoopularlenumriits won! J have
locked them up in his own bufoin, and have
kept them tlieie till policy would give thein
vent, and that would not lie till the people
were'difjpofed to receive them. Mr. Adams
may not have afled with policy by turning
author But believing his fentiir.ents well
founded.and very important to his country,
he has not heiitated to avow them. Admit
(ftey aiv Â»Â»ongâand Iris adversaries trouble
themfclves tefs to prove that they are wroiijr
than that they are unpopular, still it is plain
that he believes thc-m rightâfor it is not to
be supposed he would raifc a clamour against
himfeif if he did not believe them.âHis con
duct is therefore ihat of a patriot; let them
fay in welcome, >a mift'aken patriot. The
men who condemn his errors ought to do jus
tice to his virtue and sincerity.âExamples of
liich manly firmnels and zealous preference of
what lie deems truth to popularity will not be
very frequent âEven-the befi. men will clitife
to enjov their own opinions in peace and qoi
etnels, and they will rarely cxpofe tl emfelves
to perfuafioa by exposing them âIt ought to
be remembered, that his bock fias been
lilhed these eight years; bis ientiments did
not prevent his being appointed Vice-trefi
fident on the firft ele<slion. It wa# then ard
is still well known that he is a tho
s ough and zcaloufly attached to our
present linppy constitution. In his writing!
quoted by his adversaries, he calls it our only
hope and the ail- of our fafety. It is not fay-
:ucn that a man who has devoted l*s
â jJ.', to
talents and a great pa
.! and fucceis to the
common
country, and wl.o, hi* very enemies fay, has
scorned to deceive it>; nHe?(t itclerves it; con-
fideiice.
While certain clamourers accuse Congress
ot having created a monied influence, a>.d in
orde rto make t'nat Influence the tnoic exttrn
fÂ»ve and mischievous have incorpt rated a na;
tional Bank, the Governor of ?>lallachufetts
goes so far as to recommend to the Legisla
ture of that State to become interested in a
Bank instituted by Law at Bolton ; He* thinks
it would be for the advantage of tie citizens.
The United States actually enjoy one fifth of
the profit of the National Bank. Our fault
finders are requested to compare the opinion
of the Governor of Mairachuletts with
charges against Congress.
Wanted, a set of second hand grievances
and complaints again ft men and measures.â
It is supposed that they have become worn
and thunib'd over during the late elections,
but they will do for every day use ; half price
will be given for them at the Office in
Street. Quete, whether is is not as proper
to save grievances as rags ? They will do a
second time in another lhape. N. B. Their
being a little foul will l>e no objection.
Some persons make a fnfs about republican
principles ; It is admitted that none are
more excelient or more ti ue ; yet are the
men who give as a toast the republican inter,
eft in the United States, meaning the antile
deral iritereft, really republican! Turn this
cant into plain Englilh, and what does it a
mountto? Draw a small party clofeiy toge
ther, and by art, induflry, and lies, obftruft
the laws of the peopie. Is he a republican
who would have drawn the sword to put the
state of New-York out of the union? Yet, the
man who was so violent that his party Ihrunk
from his flandard, when he was willing and
ready to erect it against the people of the
United States, and their free constitution, is
now held up as the pure republican, the man
of the people âActions speak louder than
words.

The decree which enjoins, that

Several hundreds of French priefls

are reduced to that degree of pover

French and Belles letters at fix sous

often lejore th. head, the latter can
not in point ol 'urth claim avy great

I hat the legs have been always
of the utmost importance and utili
ty to the head, conducting it to and
from all places of business, profit
and pleasure, and were the fir ft
why raised it to its present exalted
flat ion.
That ill armies the legs have been
occasionally found a grand fpecific

by running a'cociy with the head to a

example, where the legs by the won
derful andalmoft unprecedented pow
ers of their Jwiftnifs, laved little (hort
of fotir thtufaud ntagnaaim'.ns j>ee

That in many particular classes of
life, the legs actually and bona fid:
support the head altogether, as in
couriers, chairtmn, running- footmen,
danciHg-majlers, corii-cuttsrs, pe/iny
ftflmen, and ripe-dancers.
That in eonlequence of these, and
many other similar benefits of which
they are to the bead. They con
ceive ihey ought no longer to fub

That it is an hardship, an injus

obliged to wade through muck and
dirt, fupporjing the while weight of the
head, who often fits up in lazy state,
curled, bedizened, and bepowdered.
That the legs are intitled to some
nobler capacity, some more eleva

That having nerves as well as the
head (the pretended feat of intelli
gence') their opinions ought not on

Speech to both Houses of the LegiJ
lature of Massachusetts, Nov. 8.
'â¢ T SHALL begle.ive to submit to
your attention the propriety
of the Commonwealth becoming in
teretted in the UNION BANK. I
do this, because if advantages are to
be derived from institutions of this
nature, a participation of them, bv
the State, will he for the intercfl. of
all the citizens : And becauTe, as it
is of great importance to the com
munity to have a proper regulation
oi the artificial medium current
within it, the public faiety will be
better guarded, by having the Bank
more under the eye of the Legisla
tive Power. Should you not have
time to attend to this at pi e
fent, you will judge, whether it is
expedient to appoint a committee to
consider it in the recefi.
" Gentiemf.k,
"I am urged,by a sense of duty,
to coiymunicate to you my mind up
on a trail fa&ion, which 1 cannot
but c'onfider as ?.n open in ft ipon
the Laws and tlie Government of
the Commonwealth.
11l the year one thoufnnd seven
hundred and fjf*ty, the Legiflatuie
of ihi.j t) en province of jViafiachu
fetts-Bav, pafled an act, intitled,
"/hi r'.:t to prevent Stage-Plays,
and other Theatrical Entertain
ments." The acft was temporary,
and only for four years. Perhaps
the iniprobability of obtaining the
Royal A lie lit lo a permanent prohi
bition of luch entertainments, was
the reason which induced the Legis
lature to condu(st the business in
this manner. The aift was contin
ued from time to time, by fubfe
qtient acts ; and oil the lecond day
of July, in the year 178s, Â» was >
an ACt of the Legiflatuie of the
Commonwealth, continued in force
until tilt? year 1797
The preamble of the A<ft is in
these words, " For preventing and
avoiding many great mifchiefs,
wlijch ai ife from public Stage- Plays,
Interludes, and other Theatrical
Entertainments ; which not only
occalion great and unneceflary ex
pences, and discourage industry and
frugality ; but likewise tend gene
taliy to increase immorality, impie
ty, and a contempt of religion."
Whether the apprehension of the
evils which might flow from Thea
trical Exhibitions, so fully exprefled
in the preamble of that ast, are well
founded or not, may be a proper
fubjedl of legislative disquisition on
a motion for the continuance or the
repeal of the law ; but the atft is
now a law of the Commonwealth ;
the piinciples upon which it is pre
dicated, have been recognized by,
and derive support from the consi
deration of several Legislatures ;
and surely it-ought to claim the ref
peÂ«fi aud obedience of all persons
who live or happen to be, within
the Commonwealth. Yet a number
of aliens and foreigners, have late
ly entered she State, and in the me
tropolis of the Government, under
advertisements insulting to the ha
bits and education of the citizens,
have been pleased to invite tfcera to,
and to exhibit before fucli ax at
tended, Stage-Plays, Interludes, and
Theatrical Entertainments, under the
stile and appellation of " Moral
Lectures."âThis fact is so notori
ous, that it is in vain to attempt a
concealment of its coming to our
knowledge."
To the Public.
THE fubfcribc begs leave to acquaint fhc pub
lie in general, and his cuftomeis in particu
lar, that he has entered into partnerftitp with
Mr. HENRY KAMMERER, and that thp Print

Perhaps there is no science more entertaining
and ufeful than geography- It reveals the difco
verics of travellers âthe remarkable cunofities of
all countries, in nature and artâthe fnuaiion of
provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, &. moun
tainsâin fine,the hiftoi y, manners, customs, laws,
forces, revenues, and government of different na-
:ions.
It is an old observation, that " there is not a
son or daughter of Adam, but has feme concern
with geography and that a knowledge of this
science is indifpcnfable towards the study of his
tory with advantage or fatijfaftion. Indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannot discourse on the
most common newspaper topics of the day without
betraying his ignorance.
So much for geography generally. With re
fpeft to the present plan, let it fuffice to lemark,
that Guthrie's Geography has been long acknow
ledged to be the bell in the English language :
however, the account of .America in it has, from
obvious reasons, been very erroneous and defec
tive. The errors of former editions will be cor
rected. and the defeÂ£U fuppiied, by gentlemen of
abilities, who have engaged to fupenntend this
undertaking, and to avail themlelves of all the in
formation that can be procured, to render it the
mod complete edition extant.
The Printer earnestly solicits the support of his
fellow-citizens throughout the United States : and
as no deposit is required, and every iubferiber will
be at liber:y to withdraw hi.i name, if, on trial,
he fnould disapprove of the work, he hopes the
friends of science, and of Arneiican arts and rra
nuf?6lures, will cheerfully and early patronize this
ufefnl work, thegreateit and mod expensive, pro

THE great importance of the Holy Scriptures,

a capital object of attention, as to preclude occa

Without withing in the smallest degree to lefft n'
