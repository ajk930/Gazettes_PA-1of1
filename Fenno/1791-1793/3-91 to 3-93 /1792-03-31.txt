GEORGE WASHINGTON,
President cf the United States.
Saturday, March 51, 1792.
(ci RCU L AR.)
Boston (Mejjuchufetts) Fcbiuury 28, 1792,
SIR,
WE have had the honor to be appointed a Committee, by the
Officers the Malfachufetts line of the late Army, to at
end to and pro (ecu te their memorial 10 the Congress of the United
States, on the of compensation tor the lofles fuftamed by
ihem and the soldiers who served daring the war, in consequence
of the lingular manner tn which their services have been acknow
ledged and requited by the United States.
By a letter b-aring date June 1, 179s yoti were informed of
the measures adopted in pursuing that object, and that a memorial
was prefentrd to Congress on the fuhjeft ot our complaint.
Finding that no reltef has been afforded, or as far as our infor
mation extends, contemplated, and convinccd that there is a just
debt as vet undischarged on the part of Govei nment, our determi
nation is to icpeat our application, and reallert our claim, until
we obtain consideration and relief; or until it shall be declared by
'he voice of the United States in Congress, that our claims are vi
sionary and without foundation; and that a hard-earned bona fide
drbt can be honorably and iuftly cancelled by certificates receiv
ed in the firft instance bv a kind of compulsion, alienated in most
cases from neceflity, unsupported by funds,and palling in exchange
lor only a (ixth or an eighth ot their nominal value.
To the pursuit of this measure we are urged by a convi&ion
â¢hat our request is founded on the immutable principles of realon,
equity and justice, by a sense of duty to ourfclves, and more espe
cially to those faithful companions of the war, who served under
our command ; whole difperled and embarrassed circumstances
preclude them fiom application, and in whose behalf we arc bound
to appear by every princi pie of dffeft on and gratitude.
Should it be obieded that the claim has lain dormant and may
have fuffered diminution, we would observe, that if America had
been conquered by Britain, neither lite, liberty, or retribution,
would probably have been ihe lot of many of the present appli
cants. To have preferred the application in any ot the years of
public embarralTment which succeeded the peace, when the go
vernment and finances of the coun'ry wanted energy and even ex
istence, would have comported neither with the iuterefts nor cha
racter of the army. The records of the old government contain
ample and frequent acknowledgment* that the services have been
faithfully performed on one part, together with an nnivtrfai dis
position to remunera'e them. And the public inability is the true
and only source to which the failure on the part of government
can be attributed. urn. r
The prefrnt government was iuftitnted for the ettablithment of
iuftice among other great objcss. To this end they potfefs the
power and ability. And as we have every confidence in the libe
rality and justice of the existing admimftration, we solicit their
final decision on the merits of our cause.
To facilitate the object of our w'.fhes, we have judged it expe
dient to depute an Agent to Congress, to attend to and exolain
the nature of our application. On the twentieth day of March
next, he will be in Philadelphia for that purpose ; and this com
munication. which we beg you to take theearlteft opportunity to
make known to the Officers belonging to ) our S'.ate, is m *?e to
acquaint you with our determination, that, it you should think 11
expedient to adopt correspondent measures, our attempt may re
ceive the aid of vour advice and afliftance.
To form a Convention of Officers from all the States, in order
to consult and agree on a joint application, has been a favorite ob
with many ; but taking every confidcration into view, we
have preferred the mode now adopted, and we hope it will meet
with your approbation.
General Wi l li am Hull, the person whom we have choten
for our Agent, will give his constant attendance in Philadelphia
during .he present feflion of Congress ; and we beg to rccommend
him to your attention and afliftance.
With fcntimcnts ot rcfpefl, we ire,
Sir,
Your most obedient Servants,

FROM THE WASHINGTON SPY,
Publithed at Elieabrth-Town, Maryland.
A WRITER in the Winchester paper, speak
ing of Col. Darke, thus concludesâ" From
authority, we learn, that through his means the
remains of our little army were saved from fall
ing a prey to the ravages ofthe wildeinefsâand,
through his means, were those on the brink ot
famine in Fort-Jefterfon, made to taste the bread
of comfort.âAmericans, conscious of the servic
es he had rendered their country, in every town
âin every villageâjoy beamed on the counte
nances of boih old and young, when they beheld
him fafe : how different was their conduci, not
many weeks ago, when one in a moie exalted
station travelled the fame road, and from the
fame placeânought but hidings and murmurings
were then heard does not this plainly evince,
that even back woods-men arc yet capable of dif
tinguilhing, and discovering, that "there is some- |
thing rotten in the Hate ot Denmark."
A correspondent thinks the very reverseâthat
those sagacious gentlemen, who behaved in that
lidiculous manner, to the commander in chief,
are not capable of distinguishing between mo
dell and silent, though unfortunate merit, and
that ofthe bombaltic egotill.' By a number of
publications froin that quarter, one would be in
duced 10 believe, that, though Gen. St. Clair 101 l
the day, in the late engagement, Col. Darke won
it; or that he secured the retreatâ when the

as well as his fortune, has, in addition to many
other liberal donations to charitable and public

" Under a deep impreflion of the generous in -

as a mark of the eUeem of our family for that

holds in the college, the books on their arrival
are to be placed in his office, and there to remain
for his particular use, as well as that of the col

whereas the-constitution considers it as, belong
ing to the respective itatesâthat the states alone
aie to fay of what description of persons ihe mi
ina fliail confilt, and who dial) be exempted from
militia dutyâCongress have only power to or
ganize them, when thus designated. He there
fore moved that the fecftion should be amended,
by ttriking out the clause which he considered
qs involving the principle he was opposed to.
11. -jeney observed, that the consequence of
me gentleman's motion would be, to render the
powei of Congress in organizing, arming, and dif
ciplining the militia, entirely nugatory.
Mr. Barnwell enlarged on the ideas fuggefled
by Mr. Seney. Â°Â°
Mr. Livermore made some general remarks on
f e terms u(ed 111 the constitution, to designate
the power ofCongrefc in refpec<t to the militia-
He contended that they were the molt vague and
indefinite that could pofiibly have been adopted.
He agreed fubltantially with Mr. Sturges. It is
the militia, laid Jhe, of the several Itates that
ongrefs have power to organize, and provide a
inode of difciphne forâlt is not a militia to be
ormed, or created, it already existsâHe there
to,- thought it heft to leave it to the refpetfive
Itates to tnake their own militia laws.
Mr. Barnwell observed, that the consequence
of the gentleman s proposition, would be a total
want ot uniformity in the militia, and a clashing
from different milit.a fyflems. That it was in
vain to expeJt an effective militia, except Con
g.e s should exercise the powers lb expressly de
legated in refpeift to this business.
Mr Boudinoc observed, that from the experi
e""Co;frf las had in th e preceding feflions
of the d,ftcuk.es attending this bufineft, he was
ii y o opinion that a plan of conciliation alone
would ever procure a patTage through the
lature for a m.litia bill-He adverted to the pow
ers of Congress in this business, and to those re
ierved to the Ratesâto the latter, he said was
- expressly reserved the power of appointing the
officers, and it they refufe ,0 do it" there fs 1
power 111 Congress to compel them. He there

Congress fliall pass, must be very fin,pie in ks
ble. a " d ' efer C Â° aS few ob as poffi!
Mr. Hillhoufe controverted the sentiments ad
vanced by Mr. BoudinotâHe said the natural
in.eience was that Congress poflblles no power
Â« all >n the cafe ; for if what that gerXnan
advances is true, no provision that Congress can
[In,. ? . lllaC , Con g lefs virtue of the powers

the militia, to fay what descriptions, ages & c
the nulitia ihall consist of-to form them' into
cotnpan.es, Corps regiments, &e.-and tha t wl,eÂ°
this is done, the states are to appoint the officers
for previous to Inch an organization, the states
cannot exercise the power of appointing the of
ficers. He hoped therefore thatUe would
not be agreed to-but that the committee would
proceed ... the business agreeable to the express
powers of the conftuution, and when they came
to the feOt.on making the exemptions, he hoped
they would make thein on a very liberal f-a'eâ
that the militia Ihould confiit of fuel, persons as
would be capable of rendering service.
Mr. Wadfworth opposed the motionâHe ob
feryed that the bufmeli had been managed in
fuel, manner, as to pare the bill â ow under con
Iteration, down to such an inadequate, defective
fyfteui, that he did not feel much interested in
its fateâft,ll he hoped the motion would no
prevail, for he considered it as better than no
provision at all He said that the militia of the
everal states ex,ft at the present moment more
by general con fen t of the persons forming thein
111 the feyeral states, than in confequence of any
laws of the particular states The people in f e
â veial states already avow the fentiinent, thatthev
think that Congress alone has the power to form
the ir.iliua. "
Mr. Sedgwick enlarged on the ideas of Mr.
Wadfwortliâ lie further remarked that the a
mendment proposed would operate extremely
unequalâand would defeat the public expecta
tions of an efficient military defence, fu'ch an one
as was confident with a free government.
Mr. St urges supported his motion âHe was sur
prized to liear gentlemen express their apprelien
fions that we should have no militia at all Ad
verting to the confutation, he explained what
he considered the meaning of organizing, &c.
it limply relates to forming, arming and arrang
ing in a particular way, those materials which
are furnifhed by the militia laws of the several
ftatesâln reply to the objections derived frorn
the inattention and aversion of the states, tofuch
requilitions as Congress may make, he said it
was not to be supposed that the states would be
so inattentive to the means of their own preser
vation, as to neglecft their duty in this refpetf.
, Mr. Niles supported the motion.
Mr. Murray observed, that in no particular
point of view was the people to be considered as
united for general purposes, more than in that
of the general defence. The militia contem
plated in the constitution, certainly does not
mean an existing militia ; for many of the states
have no militia nor militia lawsâand therefore
the clause mull refpecft a militia to be formed or
createdâHe enlarged on the neceflity and wis
dom of the pro"ifionâThe appointment of the
officers, he considered as being properly left in
the power of the states.
The motion was negatived.

WE were arvifed upon t-e commencement of the present

t.-iou d be equally divided.upon a bill which had palfed tneHeul'e
ot Reprefenta: v j, he would vote tor tne biU. This deter mma
t- >n was thought wife and just, becÂ«<ufe upon the permanent icale
of the government it would be eqnal, one while favorable to one
r'erelt, and a'-.o?her to tv. - ->ther. And the peculiarity of his

THE editor of this publication hopes, from the eltabl:(hed re

it will be found a more complete system tor the indtuCtion ot the
female world, than p rhaps any other extant.
A volume, under the present title, was lately published in Eng
land and Ireland, and had a molt rapid sale, having been uuich- ied
bv almost every lÂ§dy of taste in thoie kingdoms. To this voiumc
the editor has added Mils More's ElTavsâMrs. Chapone's letters
on the government of ihe temper âand Swift's letter to a young
lady newly married. These h*ve coofidei ably enhanced us value,
and he doubts not, the ladies on this fide of the Ailantic will be as
generous 'n their encouragement of a work intended tor their ad*
vantage as those in England and Ireland have been.
