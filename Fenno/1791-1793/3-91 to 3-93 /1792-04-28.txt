APTROVED APRIL THE FOURTEENTH, 1792.
FROM THE COLUMBIAN HERALD,
Printed in Charleston (S. C.)
AFTER a neglect of upwards of four years, the scheme for
cutting a canal between the Santee and Cooper Rivers,
has been lately resumed; as this scheme will in its confeqHen
ces prove extremely important to the citizens of this slate, I
trust a few reflections on this head will not be thought either
idle or useless.
This fubjeft, on confideratior, natnrally divides it r elf into
two branches. Utility to the public in general, and to the
proprietors in particular.
To be convinced of it? utility to the public, we have only
to infpeft: the map of theCarolinas and the adjacent countries.
The produce of the lands (both in North and South-Careiina)
bordering on Saluda, Enoree, Tyger, Pacolet and Broad Ri
vers, together with those on the Wateree, and the dbTerent
branches on the Catawba, and all the other lcfler rivers and
creeks which have a communication with the Santee, must ne
cefl'arily come to market by this canal; for M ere the boats to
go round by Bull's Bay, (letting aside its dangers, though a
place almost equal to the Sylla and Charibdis of the ancients)
they must add upwards of fourteen days to their journey.â
And is it conceivable that they would refufe to avoid ail this,
when they might do it for the price of a trifling toll on each
boat that pafied through the canal? I fay trifling, for though
25 per cent, is an immense sum to receive as interest, it will
be a very small one when divided into the very large number
of boats which must inevitably pass through it; it will not a
mount to the hundredth part of the sum loft, during the four
teen days delay, by the wages of the hands, the interest of the
amount of the cargo, and the various other lofies they would
sustain
The confluence of the easiness of tranfportingucrops tq
market, would be an amazing increase of population and fetr
tleraents in the back country of this itate, and of N. Cafolia*.
Articles of produce, provifious, tobacco, ikins, &c. &c. wouM
be at almaft one half their (M'efent price; and Charle&gn, from
one of the dearest, would speedily become one of the theapeft
place; upon the continent of America.
If we look forwards a few years, to the time whoa the po
population of the country (which I have already 4hewn this
canal will coatribute not a little to haflen) will be greater, we
mav reasonably hope far a communication with the we/lern
country, by means of the Cherokee or fame other of thaje nu
numerous large rivers which form a junvtion with the Ohio;
that fucli a communication would render Charleston the fu ft
city ia the United States, is too-clear to a4mit of a doubt.â
We may therefore expe& ? that every citizen'of Carol::.!
GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Prejxdent oj the United States.would wifli well to. and afllfl all in hi? power to carry fueh ?n
undertaking into execution; this I think is requiring no gre:;t
exertion of patriotism or love of our country, provided it will
not be materially prejudicial to his interefl; it becomes, there
fore, every citizen's duty to fubferibe to this scheme; and
whether it will be prejudicial or advantagcou", to o*.rn a share
or shares in this company, ihall now be the objetft of my en
quiry.
To contend that to receive 25 per cent on money, is advan
tageous, would be to the highest degree ridiculous and abl'urd :
the only question is, whether the cutting of this canal is prac
ticable at a reasonable expence ? Colonel Senf y one of the molt
fkilful engineers, perhaps in America, has estimated the ex
pence at 1. which together with the debts of the com
pany amounts in the whole to about 60,0001. this is generally
thought a very high estimation, and perhaps the expence will
prove still lower than is generally thought. In the time of
Charles the 2d, it was in contemplation to join the rivers
Forth and Clyde, in Scotland, by a canal 35 miles long, 4 feet
deep, and 24 wide, and the expence was calculated at 75,000!.
Supposing the ground of the present canal to be similar to the
ground in that, the expense of the prelent, upon the fame cal
culation, would be but 42,85/1. But the ground through which
the present canal will be cut is much more favorable to the
intention, than the ground through which the Seottifti canal
palled. In that cafe too, it was necefTary to carry the canal
over large rivers, by means of aqueduct bridges, built at a ve
ry great expence, and which frequently flood in need of re
pairs. From the great descents too in different parts of it,
numerous locks were requiiite â * here from the nature of the
ground, no aqueduct bridges will be necefTary, and the equali
ty of the country, will render many locks necdlefs.
But allowing the expense to be 60,0001. the number of boats
which will use this canal, will easily pay 25 per cent on this
sum. The company have divided their stock into a thousand
lhares, each share will therefore amount to 601. the interest of
which will amount to 151. This.share, therefore, when the
canal is compleated, will be worth to an Englifti money-hold
er 3031. the interest in England being 5 per cent; to a Dutch
man it will be worth still more, the interest in Holland being
less : but allowing a holder to receive the interest for whicty
the bank discount, 6 per cent, a share in the intended canal
will be worth 2501. â20 fliillings in 6 per cents, fells at present
for 24s ; fliaresin the canal company, at 2501. will be equally
profitable to the buyer, as if he were to buy il. in 6 per cents,
for 20 shillings, which he can immediately fell for 24 shillings.
The above calculations suppose the canal to be finifhed ;
hut as it will be some time before it will be in a situation to
take toll, something must be deducted on that account; it is
calculated that the canal will be near fix years in preparing,
allowing ten pounds for the interest of the different iol. per
annum payment*, the whole amount of a share will be 701. It
is, however, most probable that the canal will be finifhed in
less time than fix years, consequently the interest will be less ;
but whether it is a less or a greater time, the value of shares
will rife very high the firft three months after the fubfeription
is full. It is a well known fact: to a number of persons in
town, that there are agents here who are dirc&ed to buy up
shares for employers in the northern states; a very little de
lay, therefore, may prevent those who would wifhit, from lie
coming fubferibers. A fubfeription of this kind in Philadel
phia was filled up in one hour.
To the profits arising from the canal, Tome thing is to be ad
ded for the increase of the value of the lands which the com
pany will own on both fides of the canal, and for the ferry they
arc to establish over Santee river, oppoiite the canal; which
will be the most profitable ferry in the state.
Upon the whole, I am of opinion that every peiTon who tho
roughly considers this fiibject, will think that it is such an one
as every good citizen will promote, both in regard to the in
terest of this country and his own.
FROM THE COLUMBIAN CENT/NFL
Mr. Printer,
IN the Congreflional debate, on the Mint Bill, I took notice
that the qbjeftion of some members to having the head of
the President for the time being, struck on the coin of the
United States, originated in the fear, that at some future pe
riod a person resembling a Nero, a Caligula, or a Hj-.lioga
bulus, might sustain that important oifice. This objection
like many others which proceeded from the fame source, to
me appears weak and deceptive. The choice of a First Ma
gistrate of the United States, originates in THE PEOPLEâ
and the man whom they chufe, let him be whom he may, is
deserving every honor that a free people can confer, notwith
standing certain visionaries may think proper to style him a
Nero, or what they please.
Indeed, Mr. Printer, the people are not much indebted to
those members for the opinion they form of their judgment!
Or, do they in the plenitude of their wisdom and discretion,
suppose that they are guardians of the good sense of the com
munity. and every object of the people's choice must firft re
ceive their approbation ?âlt feenm so, or whv do they liifpeft
that t'ie people of America will elett a Caligula for their
President >âMy opinion is, that rulers exceed the bounds of
their duty, when they attempt to call in question the propriety
of the choice of the peopleâand if it could even be fnppofed
that they would ever unite to chufe a person refemblin" a
Neroâthat person ought to be honoured and refpefted. Â°

ANECDOTE of THE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA.
WHEN the late Mr. Peyton had finifhed the fix pictures
representing the definition of the Turkish- fleet (in which
Mortimer painted the figures) he gave directions to have them
engraved and requefttd the Empress would permit him the
honour of infcnbing the prints to herâat the fame time Ihe
would communicate to her Ambafiador I.er commands relative
to the language in whic!, the dedication should be written as
He did not: know whether (he would have it in Ruffian or
French. Her reply was memorable :â" Let the dedication

for UfcÂ», being aflced how he liked his situationâreplied very
we.l, and JJjmight h.mfelf in a much better condition than his
Governor Huntington; who was continually trem
bling from fear of being turned out of office ; while he was per
fectly Happy in an established provision for life.
On the bill declaring the eijfent of Congreft, to cer-
MR. GILES moved to ftrlke out theflrft clause,
and made sundry remarks on the unequal
operation of a law of Maryland which should
fubjeft the veflels of other States to a tax solely
for the benefit of the port of Baltimore. It is
designed by this bill to raifeafund to be applied
for the removal of a natural obftrutfion in ihe
navigation of that port âand hence he considered
it as a perpetual tax on the citizensof other States
âin this view he obje<sled to it, as a partial im
positionâit was mnch complained of, he said, by
the neighboring ports ; he hoped therefore the
clause would be struck out.
Mr. Seney supported the clause ; lie observed
that tho the port of Baltimore would be benefit
ed in the firft instance, yet it was by no means a
partial business, the accommodation and fafety
to shipping refuJting from "it had an important
reference to the commerce of the union ; it con
tributes to the fecuritv of navigation both foreign
and âand the importance of the trade
of ttyat place was fufficiently obvious from the
amokint of the revenue collected there ; the fa
lutaj-y effects of the regulations which have been
adopted and fan&ioned by Congress, he conceiv
ed were fufficient reason for continuing those
regulations.
Mr. Goodhue and Mr. Gerry offered a few re
marks in opposition to the regulation, and said
the provision might be extended with equal pro
priety to various other parts of the unionâit
ought not therefore to be taken up except on
general principles.
Mr. Murray defended the regulation of the
bill on general principlesâhe considered it in the
light of a turnpike roadâwhich though it may
fubjecft the ciiizens to a tax, they are abundantly
compensated by the benefits relulting from the
accommodation thereby provided ; the tonnage
paid is a finall duty, applied expressly to this ob
jecl, and cannot reasonably be considered as an
oppressive or partial taxâand it is paid by those
who are immediately benefitedâand is in every
sense reciprocal.
REFLECTOR.
Mi". Miles laid he had seconded the motion for
(Inking out, on a miftnken apprehensionâhe had
supposed the money to be colletfed was to go in
to the public Treafary, but the remarks of the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Murray) had
undeceived him and he thought his comparison
to a turnpike road was in point ; he then en
larged on this idea, and said he could not conceive
what injury would result from extending the
principle to any part of the union where similar
obftrudtions exist:.
Mr. Sterrett supported the he gave a
Ihort hiltory of the business, and then enlarged
on the general policy of the measure ; it had
been objed-ed to by one gentleman on cofiftitu
tional groundâthis was an obje<3ion which he
had not expetfted, but he conceived it totally un
founded, as no partial preference was contended
for, but merely the continuance of a regulation
which had been fanAioned by the general go
vernment, and was clearly within the spirit and
letter of the clause which has reference to the
commerce and navigation of the States ; it is a
regulation of a general nature, that tends ta ihe
advancement of the trade of the union as well

bill to confer similar benefits on all other sea-port
places laboring under natural impediments in
their harbors.

principles, and said he should advocate a law
which has for its object similar regulations in
refpecft to any other place laboring under the
like difficulties.

who with republican freedom canvasses their mealures, in conver

that they have done this. The man who would let down the

Hie ft iedd.Â» of the people, are the friends of the government
which the people have eiUblifhed âmuch greater credit it due to
thole cxertiuiu by which the ticw constitution was obtained than
many a.e disposed to allow ; and with refpeft 10 the administra

who fecm d.fpofed to derogate from its mcriis, that 111 addition
to innumerable forefeen difficulties anting from the chaotic fuua
tion in which our affairs wcie found at its commencementâthe
majority has been perpetually opposed by a pat ty, who wmle i,ey

Iclves by the wisdom of any plans which they have offered as l Â« :>.

Public exigencies prellingâ
Public debt's a public blefling !
But fecure> there nothing woifc is;
Public debts are public curses.'
To get in debt is undoubtedly one of the " Rights of Man"â
it is not a new do&rine that never to pay is anotheiâhence the rail
ing against the funding system.
It is a poor compliment on the judgment of the people, and a
republican government, to find fault with the decisions of the
majority.
It is a republican sentiment that the people are the obligees,
when public irufts are faithfully executed.âli is a monarchical
trail in politics, when public officers are obliged to coofider their
own interest and that of the people as aiftintf.
