REFLECTIONS
ON THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE
distilleries of the united states,
HERETOFORE EMI'tOYED ON
FOREIGN MATERIALS.
IT has been a fubjeft of frequent apprehcnfion, to attentive ob
servers on the internal industry of bur country, that the Diflil
leries wouid one day be deprived of their neceUary supply o\ fo
reign materials; the obvious poflibility of various events suggested
thcfc fears. A contingency, as unhappy as it was unexpected, has
at length happened, whicK menaces a long interruption, perhaps a
total privation, of that large part ot those supplies which has been
drawn from Hifpaniola ; and the late difordcrs in Martinico have
confpiied to heighten the evil.
In consequence of these events, the ordinary operation of above
one hundred Distilleries will be fufpeuded, and the subsistence of
those numerous families that are dependent on them may for a
time be cut off. The ravages already committed in the Weft-
Indies must occasion a defalcation of produce, which will require
several years of industry to restore, alter tranquillity shall be efta
b 1 vfhed. To supply our demand for the raw material from any
other source, is impra&icable ; and if it were poflible to procure
from the iflauds of other nations di/lillcd spirits equal to our con
sumption, yet the importation would be exceflively expensive, as
well as impolitic. Little more than eight millions of gallons are
annually made in those islands; and the demand for the expelled
Spanish war advanced the price of rum in Jamaica 50- per centâ
What then would be the effect of a new and certain demand for
feverll millions of gallons ?
But if it were pra&icable to procure the distilled spirits from
abroad upon moderate terms, what would be the fate of the Ame
rica*) Distillers, their workmen and dependents ?âWould not
their capitals become unproductive, and their distilleries fink, into
ruin ?âlt is to be feared, too, that the navigation interest conned
cd with this branch of industry, will teel a share of thefc unfortu
nate events.
To avoid evils so great and extensive, must be the wish and en
deavor of every good citizen : if, however, they cannot be altoge
ther avoided, prudence perhaps may mitigate them :âit is thought
that a mitigation of them miy be found in the application of our Diflil
lers to the manufacture of Grain Spirits.
The harvests of Europe are fa id to have been abundant ; those
of the United States are known to be so ; and a redu&ion of the
prices of grain seems to be a neceflary consequence : the present
time, therefore, is the proper one to commence this buftnefs.â
The transportation of grain coastwise to the Distilleries, and of
the distilled spirits to the consumers, on all the navigable waters
of the United States, will give employment to those velTels which
may neceirarily relinquish the Frcnch Weft-India trade.
It will not escape the. observation of those who meditate the
eftabliftiment ot Breweries, that the present is a favorable moment
for proceeding in that most beneficial branch. It is well known
that brewing, and the distillation of spirits from grain, are two
very profitable manufactures in Great-Britain ; altho the Brewers
and Distillers there pay 50 per cent higher for grain, than the or
dinary price of the fame article in this country. Holland also
brews extensively, and in distillation from grain exceeds Great-
JBritain ; vet fhc imports more gr;tin than (he manufactures, and
more fuel than her Breweries and Distilleries consume.
The difference of eleven cents per gallon (about 40 per cent, on j
the value of the article) in favor ot spirits dmilled frorr\ native ma
terials, when compared with imported spirits, gives an advantage 1
to the home manufacture, which will be duly animated by every !
judicious calculator :âthere can be no doubt that this advantage
will be always preserved, and probably increased, by the laws of
the United States.*
The strongest inducement to reasonable men, for the employ
ment of their capital and talents in any undertaking, is the hope
of permanent profit founded on fair calculation : this calculation
she distillers are bed able to makeâto them, therefore, the ideas
herein suggested are submitted, with due respeCt, by
Salem, Nov. 19, 1791. A CITIZEN.
* Ambng. other inducements the National Government would have to
*dopt this policy, it is demonjlrable, that the encouragement to the cuhure
of grain that would be derived from the use of it in diflillation would
prove the mofl effe&uaJ security againfl a scarcity of. bread.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
ON POLITICAL CANDOR
CANDOR is an amiable virtueâit exifls in ve
ry well ordered minds only. It means con
descension to the opinions of others ; it implies
that we make proper allowances for the motives,
and give due weight to the reasons of those on
whom we pass our judgment. This virtue has
been ftjrangely confounded with sincerityâso that
when we fay a mill wants candor, he gets angry,
and underltamls by it that he is called a liar.
Whereas the faying of him that he is nncandid,
implies that he does not allow their jnlt weight
to the reasons and motives which govern another.
This fault he may commit in the sincerity of his
heart, and indeed in every controversy each is in
a degree obliged to fix this charge upon the
other.
Of all difimfiions, those which concern politics
are the most difficult to manage wit hour offending
against candor, and yet they are the very cases in
which it is molt amiable and ufeful to prat-life it.
Men love their own opinionsâthey finceiely be
lieve them to betrue, and that the errorof their
opponents will be very pernicious. Every spa' k
of their love for the truth, for the good of other
men, and of felf love, concenters in the contro
versy, till their zeal flames out, sometimes in an
ger, fonietimes in enthusiasmâAccordingly we
NOT E
find ujeri more zealous about the affairs of the
public than their own. You will find a man cool
and condescending in affairs that concern h'imfelf,
He ii ready to make facrifices, and is forward to
make them, to convince you that he is capable-os
acting a manly part. Wt that man into public
life, you will fee him (tubborn. He not only con
tends for intereils that c .ill, bur he will not give
up the possible chance of advantage. He works
the fineft thietUl of his fancy into the Itrongeft
rtulFs. HU theories, \Vlil 'h 110 other man would
father, become truths and duties.
Why then should men in public life judge of
one another by their opinions? â 'Tis a Itandard
which would keep theih ever at variance. Pri
vate worth and good sense are the proper objedts
of mutual esteem. After every debate, the zea
lous partizans on both fides, as foot! as they have
had time to cool, will find that they have rated
their own opinions too hioh, and those of their
adverfarics too low. As focn as they begin to
grow warm, theyflionld therefore begin to make
fui. ii allowances as they would wifli to have made
for ihemfelves.

_ Mr. Madison observed, that the idea of dimi
nishing the fractional parts appears to be the only
reaion For the alteration proposed by the Senate.
The aggregate of these fractions only has been
taken into consideration ; bur, said he, if the
fractions of any particular states will be aug
mented by the amendment, which would be the
cafe, he conceived that the argument amounted
to no good rcafon for agreeing to itâand this
he said, would evidently be the fact.
Mr. Williamfon was opposed to a concurrence
he observed, in general, that the operation of the
amendment was to diminifli the fractions to the
Eaflward, and encreafe those to the Southward
The southern Hates, he said, had fuffered so m uch
under the harrow of speculation, that he hoped
liomeafures would be adopted to leflen the means
of informations to the people of those states, by
denying them that proportion in the reprefenta-
T n rÂ° wll ' ch the y aie entitledâHe regretted
that some of the southern states were not fully
represented at this time in the Senateâhe tho't
it probable that a different decision in that cafe
would have taken place.
Mr. White observed that the amendment would
operate generally against the larger states.
Mr. Sedgwick differed from those opposed to
t e amendment ; in his statements refpecfting the
fractional parts to be produced by ;,,oooâhe
saul they were fewer on the whole than would
result from any other number between 30 and 40

this saul he, figures would demonstrate. Hence

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, December 12, 1791.
Debate on the amendments proposed by the Senate to
the Reprsfentation Bill.
' I "*HE firft amendment was to encreafe the ratio
to 33 thousandâwhich being read,
Mr. Gerry observed that the bill had paflcd
both the committee of the whole, and the house,
by a large majority. The principle, as he was
informed, on which Ine amendment had taken
place in the Senate, was to reduce the fractions
which would result from the ratio proposed by
the houseâbut he said this difficulty had been
fully considered in the house. The representa
tion. every body knows, is now unequalâand it
must be submitted to for two years longerâand
now it is proposed, at that period, to deprive the
people of that representation to which they are
entitled by the Constitution !
He thought that it was extraordinarj'that after
the ratio prbpofed in the bill had been agreed to
by the house, by so large a majority, a proposi
tion to alter it Should Save been agitated and
carried in the Senate. Till some better reason
than he had heard assigned should be offered, he
should be agahift concurring with the Senate
he moved therefore that the house disagree to
the amendment Qf the Senate. The motion
was seconded by Mr. White.
Mr. Livermore was In favor of agreeing to the
amendmentâhe enlarged on the inequality in
the representation the great fractional num
bers which would from, the ratio of 30,000.
He was fully of opinion that the public business
could be full as well transacted' by ioj members,
the number which Wotiltl be produced by a ratig
of 33,000, as by 112 o-r-113, the number arifini*' ;
from the ratio of 30,000.
Mr. Benfon said there was one idea which, if
[ it had been considered in time, might have been
adopted, and would perhaps have given very ge
neral fatisfa<stion, and that is, that the represent
atives of the United States shall amount to a cer
tain number, accordingto the whole number of the
people, fay one to 50,000 âthis would have given a
surplus number which might have been assigned
to those states that have the largest fractional
numbers. He had formerly, he said, voted for
30,000, but as the principle of equality was more
particularly attended to in the amendment, he
Ihould now vote for the ratio proposed by the
Senate. He observed, some states are ftationai y,
the encreafed representation of the larger states,
when once eftablilhed, never will be receded
fromâthis ought to be taken into serious confe
deration.
270
cife of their office whetn'.iey p ;l ,Ted it a, 1â¢ â¢
mod undoubtedly a right Po to do ' " ad
He read several calculations to shew thar i-t
aggregate of the fractions would be' reduced un!
w.uds of 90 thousand, by a ratio of 33 tiiouf.,,,,*Â»
and that the fractions in every ltat e ; except one'
would be dimimfhed also by it-He advened t '
the circumstance of the southern states deriving
Po great an advantage from the reprePeutativef
they are entitled to by reason of their po(/ effi J
flavesi ; and though he would not do any t hi n Â£
which would interfere with the Constitution
j that point, he Paid every dictate of jnftke and
J equality was oppoPed to giving an unneceflary
and undue advantage to the southern Hates
this matter. "
Mr. h'indley Paid he had expetfted tobearf ome
thing new 011 the fubjec't, to induce an ulte,-.
tion in the opinion of the house, but had heird
nothing. Fractions, said he, were fully consi
dered before, both 111 the house and in the com
mittee. This he considered as one of the lctltr
matters pertaining! to the fubjert. He Paid the
bed; way would have been to have Pettled the ra
tio without knowing the numbers of the peo-ilt
m the several ftatesâtho that could not be done
as the numbers are known, yet he said he had
made it the rule of his conduct in voting The
principle being eftabiiihed, there will be no room
tor combinations, nor any ground for complaints
and reproaches refpecfting either southern or nor
thern mterefls. He was for adheringto the prin
ciple as that contemplated in the Constitutionâ
and this he conceived the house had done- and
he hoped they would nor depart from it; and as
to fractions, in competition with that principle'
he considered them of very little confequer.ee J
He c.id not deny but a smaller number of repre
sentatives would be competent to doing the pub
lic business ; but diPpatch of public business, and
a republican representation of the people, he con
ceived were diftinei thingsâhe therefore should
have been in favor of a laiger representation.
. He controverted the right of the Senate to de
cide for the house in regard to this questionâit
was not, he said, a question of right and 'privi
legeâit appertains principally to the representa
tive bod}'.
then considered the quertion as it refpedted
the Senateâand he thought that a large repre
sentation was neceflary as a barrier to the influ
ence of that bodyânor do I, said he,'think this
as an unreasonable jealousy, when the constitu
tion ot human nature is considered. Theconfti
tution ot the United States is express on the.fub-'
ject, and now is the time when the people ought
to enjoy the ad vantages of the representation of 1
one to thirty thoofand.
Another consideration to induce a large repre
sentation, he deduced from the accumulation of'
money capitals in the United States, which, said
lie, have been encreafed beyond all parallel the,
influence of these capitals will find its way into,
thtf house. He hoped no alteration would be
made in the determination of the majority 0/ the
members.
4 W 1 ". Goodhue said, the difference between the
result of the two ratios was so small, that he did
not couceive it would constitute a Sufficient rea
son for disagreeing to the amendment ; he stat
ed that the difference between the Southern and
Nothern states, 011 the ratio of 30.000, was be
yond all reason in favor of the Southern states ;
whereas the difference on that of 33*000 was very
small indeed, in favor of the Northern statesâ
which evidently demonstrated that the principle
of equality was involved in agreeing to the a
mendment of the Senate.
Mr. Hillhoufe stated various particulars to shew
the inequality of the representation by 30,000,
particularly as it refpetts the smaller ftatesâHÂ©
said lie rejoiced that the Senate had given their
opinion on the fubjeA, they had a right to do it
they are the representatives of the people,and
on this question are probably more impartial
judges than this House.
Mr. Gerry still supported his motion for a dis
agreementâhe stated a cafe to ftiew that in the
oidinary course of population, a state atthenexc
enumeration, which now contains 330,000, will
then have a much larger fraction, by a ratio of
33000, than any now contemplated.
_ He fuppofecl the Senate had a differentintereft
111 tins business from that of the HouseâThe larg
er states not being represented in the Senate,and
the representation of those states which are fta-
tionary, or nearly s O , being fullâis the reafou
of this proposed amendment.
Mr. Ames observed, that he thought the on
ly question was to consider whether the bill, as
.ent from this House, was a proper oneâfor as
to a fmnller oj- larger representation, he confi
c.ered all debate 011 that precluded, as the only
ciitierence was between ioj and 115.
He then entered into a consideration of the bill
as it refpetfts equality âhe allerted that the bill
Was nor only iniprop:'Â«- as unequal, but was alio
uncou fticutionalâl o shew the inequality of the
bill, he observed tha: Virginia, with 6;o,ooo in
habitants, would have as many members as fix
of the smaller dates, whose s>gpvega,e numbers
-%: Vexceeded those of Virginia upward* of 70,000 â
This inequality, lie laid, amounted 10 a direct
violation of the Conltitution, which expressly
declares that representation and taxation Ihall
be according to numbersâHe amplified this
idea by (hewing how ic would operate, ifltricftly
adhered to in the afleftiuent of taxes.
Mr. Williamfon'ftill contended,that thededuc
tion from the bill was two members from th.-
Eaitern and four from the Southern (tates, which
plainly {hewed that the amendment was in favor
ofthe Eastern statesâand added, that it the
Southern states had been represented in the Se
nate, the bill would not have been lent back.
Mr. Niles suggested an amendment to the a
â¢mendment of the Senate, which was to itrike
out one after the word Delaware, and to insert
two This, he observed, lie wns influenced to
move, from the consideration of the manifeft in
equality of the representation of that Hate, com
pared with that of other states, particularly Vir
giniaâfje had 110 doubt, from the jultice of the
House, that if the amendment he pi opofed was
not directly contrary to the Conltitution,it would
be aoreed to. âHe then adverted to the Consti
tution, and read the passage refpeiftmg repre
sentation and taxation, which are to be apporti
oned according to numbersâHe observed that
there were evidently wanting to compleat the
sentence, tliefe words, as nearly as may be, âwith
this explanation addeid, he went on to shew that
the principle of equality would be more itriiftly
adhered to, by admitting his amendment, than
by rejetfting icâfor if Delaware contains 58,000
inhabitants, 28,000 were certainly nearer to
33,000, than 33,000 were to 58,000. He recited
other paflages of the Conttitution, to shew that
his idea was compatible with it.
Mr. Benfon again suggested his proposition, of
apportioning the reprefer.tation according to the
whole populationâHe was in favor of a large
reprefentaiion. The principle advanced by the
gentleman from (Mr. Findley) he
faidwas undoubtedly just, that a large represen
tation was neceflary in a free government, for
information and fecuricyâthis principle is not
to bedifputed.âAnd with respect to the danger
from corruption, he said, undoubtedly patronage
and influence would creep inâbut lie conceived
that danger of a more fefio-js nature was to be
appreheiuled from another quarterâgentlemen
had mentioned the funding systemâin queltions
of that kind, where one part of the Union tho't
themselves the only fufferersâthe liberties of
this country would be but a secondary consider
ation.âFor in a republican government, the ma
jority must rule, and the minority mult l'ubmitâ
except they are oppressed, and then they have
an undoubted right to refill. -
â¢Mr. Giles defended the billâhe observed that
the apparent inequality in the representation of
the smaller states, was rendered equal by their
representation in the Ser.ateâHe enlarged on
the idea of adhering to the ameiulnieiit propof
ed to the Constitution. The inequality spoken
of, he said, was in fart in favor of the (mailer
statesâHe adverted to the reltive spirit in ftfttitf
of the HatesârSome of the meafuresof CongresS,
h<f laid, were so disliked, that the people in those
states wished fhemfelves separated from the go
vernment. The people of the Mate from which
he came, were so imprefled with the idea ot the
ratio being fettled agreeable to the bill, that he
really feared the discontents of ihe people there
would be increased to an alarming degree, thould
the amendment of the Senate be agreed to.

There is the highest probability that the reports relating to the
capture ol Fort-Jtfferfon are unfounded.
It is mod probable that General Scott, with the Kentucky mili
tia, may repair to the said poll, and bring off the wounded left
there ; and as it appears too far advanced to be supported, the gar
rison may probably be withdrawn.
The public may be alTured, theTe are some grounds whereon to
estimate the enemy who encountered General St. Clair's army, at
about three thousand Warriors. It is said, that upwards of eleven
hundred Warriors, of the Ottawas and Chippawas, who inhabi,
the waters of Lakes Superior, Michegan, and Huron, came to the
affiftauce of the Miami Indians. This number, combined wth
the Miami Indians the Powtewattimas, Wyandots, Delaware?,
and upper Wabafh Indians, would fully amount to the number
above mentioned.
It is said, that the Miami Indians, at the head of whom are the
remnants of the Shawanefe, after the deftruftion of their mwnsbv
General Harmar, in Oaober, 1790, fern meA'ages to the mod dis
tant nations of Indians, as well to the southward as to the west
ward for affiflance. Although it does not appear they received
any afliftaoce from the southward, as all those powerful tribes,
amounting to about fifteen thousand Warriors, are at peace, and
have treaties with the United StateÂ»; yet, the hcntile Indians were
but too fuccefsful in their negotiations westward.
It is further said, that lome of the nation of the Sacs would have
been in the aaion, had not their distance prevented. This nation
ar<i very numerous, and inhabit the country uoon the upper parts
of and moft'y to the westward thereof.
It lfWo said, that neither the famous Mohawk Chte., Captain
lofeph Brant, or any of the Six Nations, joined the Miami In
dians. Caot. Brant was at Niagara the beginning of November,
several hundred m.lcs from the place of iftion.

REVENUE LAW.
By JOHN NEVILLE, Inspector of the Revenue,
Survey No. 4, District Pennsylvania.
Friends and Fellow-Ltnzeni ojthe Counties oj IVcJlmoreUnd,
Wi'jhingloii) Fayette and Alleghany,
XT is with p<ir*cular regret I perceive, that my acceptance of
J. the office I now hold under the United States, has not the ap
probation of a conhderable proportion of you. It is with ItilJ
more regiet I find that a very important law of the federal go
vernment is an obj'dl ot dislike and opposition with the fame per
sons, who difapprovc the part I have taken towards its execution.
It, in so great a public concern, I permit my (elf to mingle any
p rfonal confederations, you will, I hope, attribute it to no other
motive than my sincere anxiety to pielcrve your esteem. If any
part of my condutt in lile has afForded you proof of my being
afctuatcd by patriotism and public spirit, you will do me ihe jul
tice to believe, that, in accepting the office which displeases you,
I yielded to my convictions of the utility and necellity of the law,
and to a fcnle ot duty. It any part of you have ever had evidence
of my regard to their particular interest aud welfare that part will,
I trull, believe me, when I allure them, that the fame regard for
their intereli, that an unfeigned solicitude for their welfare, has
no small Ihare in dictating the observations which I (hall submit
in this their confide ration, and which I exhoit them,
as they tender the good of their country, and their own particular
good, to weigh with coolness and seriousness.
Felloiv-Citizens,
The law is a clear exercise of a constitu
tional power, delegated by the people o* the United States
to their reprefentatms in Concrefs. 11 is a powei grant
ed, not by implication, but by express words. The Bih
fe&ion of the full article of the federal conflitution fays, "The
Congress Ihall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts
and excises." The right, indeed, is not called in'qucftion, but
objections have been made to the exercise of it. In patting the
law, therefore, there was no usurpation of power, no in
vasion of the rights of the Slates or or the citizens'; nothing
more than the exercise of a discretion, constitutionally and clear
ly vested in the representatives of the UNION. Since the pafl
sing of the ast no State legislature has intimated a disapprobation
of it. 'Tis true that one branch of the legislature of Pennsylvania,
during the readings of the bill in Cong rets, exprelled their dislike
of it ; but the other branch alio freely chosen by the people dis
agreed to the r< solutions. It would not be unbecoming in us,
as citizens ot this Slate, to remember that our afTembly once enact
ed an excise law, authorising the forcible entry of dwelling
houses even in the night, and that there exiftcd at the time of the
late difcuflious in our legislature, an equal excise on home made
spirits, which being no higher on the Ilrongeft rum and brandy
than on our grain and fruit liquors, must be confefled to have
been much Ids favorable to agriculture than the prcfent law.
I flatter myfclf, I should not be one of the firft to recommend
to my fellow citizens an acquiefance in any attacks upon their
rights, a fubmillion to any alfumption of unconstitutional power
on the part ot their government, or an implicit deference to the
opinion of rulers. But, wheu a law has been enacted by the le
gislature of a countiy, after long, repeated, and mature delibera
tion; when its conflitntionaliiy is not even pretended to be
drawn into qucftion, when its expediency only is d'.fputed, it
appears to me that there are fomc reafonablc preemptions in fa
vor of the propriety of the law, which ought to have great Weight
with piudenl and good citizens.
It is a natural prcfumption for inflance, that the representatives
of the people of the United States must be better acquainted with
what will promote the best interest and greatest convenience of
the whole, than the inhabitants of any small portion of the union ;
and it is evident that the laws of the union ought to be accommo
dated to that rule, and cannot in every mltance operate alike up
on the wishes, and interefls, real or supposed, of every part.
Some laws will best suit fomc parts, other laws will best suit
ether parts of the great family ; and in the course of things the |
advantages and di fad vantages will be equalized as neaily as the
imperfection of human affairs will permit ; each part finding its
particular happiness in the order and piofperity of the whole.
This observation applies as well to the laws of a particular State,
as tothofeof the United States. Jt is, generally [peaking, im
ppffible, that any law can aftcCt all the parts of a community ex
:*Â£tly alike ; and it will be highly Satisfactory, if the operation of
all the laws should be so happily devised, astodrawthe public
revenues with equality from the whole of the people.
It, then, Congress, the members ot which body come from
every parrof the union, are likely to be better acquainted than
you are, with the interest and convenience of the whole, is it
not more probable that they have judged and aÂ£t uprightly, than
that those among you who condemn what they have done, are
right in the judgment which they pronounce upon it ?
ocs u lerve to confirm this probability, that no combi
nations like those which have been formed among you have ap
peared in any other part of the United States ? If the law were,
upon the whole, really an opprtlfive and tyrannical a6t, would
not an opposition to it before this have resounded from every
pait of the continent ? Are the citizens ot the reft of-the union
iefs watchful ot their rights,lcfsjealousof their liberty,than you are?
I will not, however, attempt to conceal from you, that there
has been a degree of diffatisfaCtion in some other quarters. Mil
conceptions have taken place eliewhere as well as among you.
But I will affirm, that it no where else wears a serious afpedt ;
' in p ro portion as the law is explained and understood, its
jufticeand policy are admitted, that the principal part of those,
upon whom it immediately operates, in the greatest part of the
Limed States, are convinced of the neccflity and propriety of
the tax ; at moftonly desiring some alterations in the details ; and
t at the great body of the people of the United States concur in
tle opinion. This information I derive from unquestionable au
thority, and I pledge myfelf to you for the truth of it. It may
oetru.v laid too, mankind have confidcred diltilled fpu
nts.sftt objects of taxation, for we know not of any country,
K. 1 13s not laid internal and import duties on them.
1 ut Â£ cnera l prcfumption and fuggefttons ot this kind are not
he only lights you have to guide you. There are well known
lacts and circumstances which afford you a better rule of judging
ou .ave only to exercise your own understandings impartially,
to think for yomfelvcs firmly and cooly, and you will cafily dis
cover the path of your interest and duty.

He is happy to inform the public, that the work has been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highest approbation; both as to the execution of the
punting, its correftnefs, and 11s cheapness compared with Englilb
copies of the fame size and quality.
As this very laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
is coined on folcly at his own roft, he is led to hope that all thole
who wilh :o poITciS a large family Bible, will fa far encourage this
lauda Â«,Ie undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
