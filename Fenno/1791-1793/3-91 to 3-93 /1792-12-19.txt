PROCELDINCS OF THE JACOBIN CLUBâ
MLe Moine, who was com
. miifioned at the last lilting to
present the plan of a circular letter,
to be traniinitted to all the allociated
societies, in order to make theni
-acquainted with the reason of the
ablolute suspension of the correl
pondence of the societies, commu
nicated the following address, which
it was immediately agreed {hould
be printed, and sent to the allocia
led societies :
" >The Motlier Society has been
obliged to interrupt its coi refpon
deuce since tlie jotli of Augult, not
because it considered that day as
butting an end to plots and intrigues,
but because many of its members
were honored with the public con
fidence, and admitted to places in
the provilionary adminiltrations,
juries, &c. The society, however,
become a lirtle more numerous, is
desirous of renewing an atftive cor
respondence with its brethren in
the departments, pei fuaded that the
present circumstances require more
than ever the molt fraternal com
munication between patriotic foci-
cues.
Since the 10th of August the con
spirators haveexpiated their ciitnes;
the public fpiric has prevailed ; and
the sovereign people recoveiing
their rights, have at length tri
umphed ovet villains leagued toge
ther again'ft their happiness and li
berty. The inhabitants of Paris,
however, have been sensible of the
lieceffity of continuing on their
of keeping flridt watch
over the agents and supporters
Â«>f the con (piracy of that traitor,
Louis the iaji ! Let us never cease to
dread, friends and brethren, that
new intrigues may fncceed to thole
already tendered abortive. The
"hits, the niufe, and tht fretencf oj
machinations ftitl breathe*! Defpo'ifm
growjs in darkness. Let us Hand
up ready to give i': a deadly blow,
under whatever form it may appear.
" The grand interests of the peer
pie are going to be difcuHed in the
National Convention. Let us not
lole a Tingle moment to
and let it hear the national wifti,
which ought alone to di'rtlt its ac
tions. Let us above all prevent, by
firm meafurcs, the danger of feeing
these new Legislators Oppolo, with
impunity, tlieir interests, or private
withes, to the sovereign will of the
nation. Let inviolability in future
be attached to nothlngbut the law ;
let all the municipal magifttates fee
pntiifhinent placed by the fide of
criroe%. Hetnjmber how final! is
the 11 timber of thofeLegiflators who
have refilled corruption.âvc-y *evÂ»
indeed can be found in each Legis
lature. Let us be inspired then
with the spirit of the electoral body
of Paris. They alone can save us
from all kinds of despotism, and
from dangers and convulsions too
much prolonged, &c.
" The decrees of that body ex
press, ' That a scrutiny shall be
made of the National Convention,
for the purpose of expelling from
its bosom such fufpetfted members at
may, in their noniination, have es
caped the sagacity of the Primary
Afl'eniblies.
" That all Deputies chosen to the
National Convention, who may have
attacked, or fliall attack, the fi>ver
eignty of the people, shall be de
clared incapable of fitting.
" That all constitutional decrees,
pafled by the National Aflenibly,
shall be lancftioned or revised by the

' That the form of government
/hall be republican.'
" These, friends and brethren,
are the important objetfs which the
electors, the community, and the
prirrtaiy afletnblles of Paris, iVtvite
you to discuss fully, in order that
you may strengthen and support the
National Convention *Â»ith your

The Minifler for Foreign Affairs
informed the Convention, that
the King of Pruflia proposed condi
tions of Peace to the northern and
central Generals ; but the Council
answered, that the Nation would
not listen to his propositions as long
as his ariny was in the country.
M. Equality (the late M. Orleans)
confirmed this intelligence.
The Minister at War communi
cated tothe Convention a letter from
General Moreton. " A strong de
tachmeiH appeared on the 27th be
fore St. Amand. After a vigorous
defence of three hours, the enemy
retired, leaving behind them 40

NATIONAL CONVENTION,
October I .
A tetter from the Minjfter for Foreign
Affairs, to the National Convention.
" Citizen Prefidenr, 1 announced
to the National Convention that o
\ei tures for a negotiation had been
made in tliff name of the King of
Prutfia to Gen. Dumourier. I men
'ioned n
e fame rime the decilit n
ol ing Executive Fovcr, which, or
deied the Generals not io listen to
the piopofals until tiie armies of
defpoti had fir ft evacuated the land
of liberty. J'he propuf.ili of the
King ot I'niilia were however re
markable, as they contained a pre
cise acknowldgement of [he nation
al authority, and of the quality of
representative of the nation in ex
ternal relations which had been at
tached formal!} to the political ex
igence of the conUitntiotial King.
Another acknowledgment, no leis
remarkable, was, that the ancient
order of things, destroyed by the
will of the nation lince 1789, was
contrary to the happiuefs of the
people.
" Such an unexpected acknow
ledge-cut ,fpo<tt a neocfly made,with
out any previous negotiation,might
incline us 10 think [hat tlie enemies
armies are in the greatelt dillreTs.
There are, however, other motives
equally prefling, which make thetn
think of peace, a kind of truce was
agreed upon, Gen. Dumourier took
advantage of it, to collecl, and pro
perly dilpofe, (he different bodies
which weie to be joined to his ar
my. He made in quietness, and
with silence, all those movements
which were necedary to give him
a fupei iority, by his situation, and
t<J confine the enemy in theirs.
While he was thus preparing for
his military plans, frequent coin nu>-
nications, that could not but be ad
vantageous to liberty,were establish
ed between the two armies. Gen.
Dumoaiier embraced this opportu
nity of exchanging prifonets of war.
The cartel agreed upon with the
Prufiian Generals was formed ac
cording to the laws decreed by ihe
National Assembly. The emigrant
prisoners were not included in it,
and the Duke of Brunfwick did not
even persist in a remonftrance,which
he had made in their favor.
" A conference on this occasion
look place between the Duke of
Brunfwick, Count de Luchefioi, mS
nilter of the King of Pt-uffia, and
Lieut. Col. Adj. Gen. Thouvenot,
who was charged with conducting
the exchange of pril'oners. In this
conference, the Duke of Brunfwick
exprefled hinifelf almost in the fol
lowing terms :â
" Our nations are nor formed to
be enemies : might not Pome mean*
he deviled for accommodating mat
ters in an amicable manner ? We
are in your country, it is desolated
by the inevitable misfortunes of
war ; we know that we have no
right to prevent a nation from giv
ing itfelf laws, and from tracing
out its internal government âWe do
*iot wifti itâwe are only interested
for the fate of the Kinp. Afliiie
us, that a place will be afligned to
him, in the new order of things,
under any denomination whatever,
a nd his Majesty, the King of Prussia,
w ill return to bis own itatcs, and
|, e coine your ally."
" The moderation of lan
guage, from a man who signed the
nianifeftoes already publiflied, and
to which the contempt of
nation has done ample
appear surprising. .i'-f
it I I /' Â» ' r 1 "
" Lieut. Col. Thouvenot replied,
' that the will of the French, re
public would not yield to any fo
reign influence, and that the repre
sentatives of the nation, to whom
the valuable deposit of its honor and
gloiy was particularly entrufled,
would continually persist in main
taining decrees which had been
fan Aliened by general opinion."
" The Duke of Brunlwick ter

that he would uallium 10 General

received it with indignation, in
which we (hare, and which int.il al
so be excited in the National Con
vention, and in all France.
<f It was immediately announced
that the truce was broken, and let

answer frOtn the King Proffia s
aid-du-camp, dating, ttt.<t the in
tentions of the King and of 11-c
Duke of Bi un(wick had been niif
linderilood ; that a new conference
was demanded ; and that tlie royal
and Imperial armies would not be
the firft to break the truce. Gen.
Duuiourier refufed to confeiu to
any new conference, or any delay
in the operations of the campaign
unlels the memorial of the Duke of
Brunfwick fliould be fir ft annulled.
Such is the atftua! state of things !
What palled during that circum
stance, will Ihew the French nation
in that refpedtable point of view
which belongs to it. All our pro
ceedings have been marked with
candor and firnniefs. We have a
bandoned llratagem and weaknels
to our enemies, and all Europe mult
perceive in our condbdt, a people,
who set a just value on peace, but
\vho are not afraid of war.

After reading the above detail,
M. Brillot then read the memori
al of the Duke of Brunfwick, which
runs in a similar strain with his two
former manifeltoes. The reading
of it was frequently interrupted
with murmurs, and when thai part
was read, which infills on the Ime
lioration of Louis XVI. to the Roy
al Dignity, the Afl'embly built into
a fit of laughter.â M. Briflot re
fuelled the lilence of pity.

" Saint Menehould, Sept. 30, at
nine in the evening, &c. &c.
" In our last letter we gave you
an account of onr arrival at the ar
my of Gen. Dumourier, and of the
effect produced on it by a notificati
on of the wife decrees which you
have already pitied. We now an
nounce to you that we have jult re
ceived intelligence, that the King
of Prussia has raised the camp which
he had about a league from us ;
from the position in which it was,
General Dumourier forefaw, that
the enemy could not long keep their
itation in the mid 11 of the desert
plains of Chaiupaigue, and without
having any communication through
which they could receive convoys
but towards Grand Pre.
" Some days ago General Dumou
rier dispatched Gen. Buernonville
with a body of I 3,000 men, to inter
cept this communication, and that
general, diltinguifhed for his acti
vity, zeal and ability, succeeded in
getting podellion of several consi
derable convoys. He likewise took
more than 100 prisoners, who ar
rived fuccelfively in the course of
the day. All accounts agree in cer
tifying the extremediftrefs to which
the army of the enemy is reduced ;
and General Dumourier formed a
very juit idea of their situation,
when he informed you that they
could not remain long in it.
" It can scarcely be believed that
experienced generals should have
penetrated intothe defarts of Cham â¢
paigne, had they not entertained a
vain hope that they should be fe
cotided in their operations by a cri
minal correspondence with themal
litems ; but the inemornble day
: dP'tttC 1 o;h has proved, that the
French, while they combat for li
berty,will pei ifli rather than con
sent to any capitulation. The ge
neral, daily informed of details
Which proved their diilrefs, proper
ly judged that by preserving their
situation, they would deftrny theef
feft of any movements which they
might attempt. This anny, f<Â» for
midable, is reduced one half by its
lick, whom they were obliged to
fend away to Grand Pre. his well
known that there is a general hof
pttal in than town, in which there
is more than 8000. Had General
Dumourier abandoned his position,
and advanced towards Chalons o;
Khelms, they would infallibly have
taken advantage of his movement,
not to attack us, but to pass through
the defile, and to eltablilli canton
ments for the purpose ofpaffing the
winter in one of the moil -fertile
countries. His constant pei Sever
ance lu.s obliged them, 1a It night,
to make a movement entirely 011->
traiy to that which he expected.
" Vhcy have quitted their per?-,'
and the communication between
Chalonsand Saint Menehoiib is now
1 e-e(tabli(hed, which gives the
French army 15 hours for the arri
val of convoys and provisions. Ar
dour and fat isfadtion prevail among
our troops, and our (ituation was
never so advantageous as at present.
The firft movement which the ene
my made indicates that they wifti
to retire through the difiles of
Grand Pre, the only pallnge which
remains to them.
" We shall not enter intoaiiy de
tails of the future plans of Gen.
Dumourier, but we think it our du
ty to inform you, that the utmolt
confidence ought to be reposed itv
him ; that the people of Paris need
be in 110 uneafinefe, and that we
hope in our next to give you ftili
more fatisfatftory intelligence. Peo
ple ought not, however, to exult in
that success which the fate of war
may reverie ; but we are able at
present to give hopes, which result
from the certain distress of our ene
my, and the diseases by which they
are weakened ; from the excellent
condition of our troops, and from
the ardor which they shew to com
bat those tyrants, who wifli to itn
pofe laws upen them, as well as from
the confidence which they have in
their General.
LEBRUN."
" P. S. It wasby mistake that we da
ted our last on the 30th ; the true
date was the 29th, at seven in the
morning. This moment we have
received a letter from General Beurr
nonville, announcing that lince yes*
terday he has ra ken 200 prisoners,
24 waggons loaded with doaths for
the troops, 800 liorfes, and five Emi
grants of the King's household. By
a second note we are informed that
he has killed 27 huflai s with a Prus
sian Commander. The National
Convention will learn these details
with fatisfatftion."
A copy of the letter from General
Dumourier to the King of Pruflia
was then read. In this letter the
General informed his Prussian Ma
jesty, that the manifeftos of tfie
Duke of Brunfwick had been treat
ed with sovereign contempt by the
whole French nation, and that it
was not by threats that a free peo
ple could be conquered. Hfi then
represented to him tb# ath'ttiltages
which would result to both nations
by an alliance of which they were
both worthy, and reqneftecl him in
the name of his own gfory and in
terest, and in tliofe of his ai my to
abandon the caule of the
Emigrants.
Tlie reading of this letter was
frequently interrupted by applau
fcs.
The Minirter for Foreign Affairs
tranfinitted to the Convention a lilt
of those amball'adors and Envoys
who had taken the new oath. The
ambaflador at the court of Denmark
had not only refilled to take it, hut
had written 10 Louis Stanislaus Xa

ders but from him, whom he conli
dered as the only lawful King of
F ranee.
We learn by an arrival at New-
Bedford, that the siege of Thion
ville was railed bv the Anftrians.â
That the Duke of Brunfwick had
for foine time been stationary at
Chalons, in Chainpaigne ; that it
was the public femiment at Dun
kirk, that General Fayette, in his
flight, had betrayed the cause he
had engaged to iupport ; and that

FROM THE MAIL.
Mr. Claypoole,
AN extract from a Georgia paper
appeared in yours and the leveral
papers i:i this city, refpeding a
Capt. Hickinan and a Mr. Skinner,
iaid to be of Boston :â In jultice to
several refpeiftable persons of their
profeHion, by tbe name ot .'skinner,
who fail from Bolton, and the citi
zens in general, it ought to be
known, that neither Capt. Hickman
nor Mr. Skinner are Americans, ndr
was the latter ever 3 months in Bos
ton. These persons being said to
be of Boston, has excited some un
happy prejudices againit the ves
sels from that place 111 the Weil-In
dies
Perhaps by giving 'his u place in
the several papers where the orhei
has been inserted, vv ill have a hap
py tendency to remove it, and pre
sent any future incouveniencies an
ling therefrom.

'TMOSE wiio reason against federal measures
A and principles may be met on fair ground
â The federal cause cannot fulfer by fair dif
cuilion. Being ued to defeat on this field,
and the people being well fettled in their refo-
Jution to maintain their own, which is the fe
deral eaufc, tiie enemies of government have
resorted to art and cunniug to obtain what
the solemn decUion of America has denied
them.âTiiey could not prevent the adoption
of the constitution ; they have therefore put.
inpraftice every artifice to mar it in the ad
ministration.âHe is a novice in the history of
parties who does not know that by doing so,
they a (ft according to the laws of their na
ture.
It is probable that a few well-wifliers to or
der and the constitution have co-operated
with men of a different ftanip in some of their
late manoeuvres.âTo such men, it is proper
to address lome reflections, to induce them
well to consider the pernicious nature of" the
schemes which they have been drawn in to fa
vor, and kmay be hoped they will not fail to
renounce them.
The papers for more than a year past have
been ftuffjd with infmuations againil the go
vernment and its nieafures ; every thing has
fceen doue to alarm the fears and jealousies of
the people. Direct charges would not doâ
they might be disprovedâbut dark hints are
given, men in oxfice are blown upon by a lide
windâ-prejudices are hunted up and heated
all the greatfyftems of Cj.igrets. The
excise, the funding system, the bank, the ex.
ceilive rare for {peculation are inide to fur
iiiili fubjefts of complaint or alarm.
This mil's of invective against the govern-
cannot have escaped tne notice of every
readerâand t'l2 influence of the newjpaoers
public opinion is too con-iderable and di
to fivTir us to believe that these incen
diary writings h.;ve bsea w noHy without ef-
I.

Mole woo have been deceived in iy be unde
ceive;!.
The writer, against govsrnment'have l*cÂ»
accufrdof the ninft fcditious antifcderaiiiin
-t ney complain heavily of this charge, aâd in
turn accule their aecufcrs of aj.r.iij" at mo
narchy ami arirtocracy; they dareÂ°not find
fault with the constitutionâthe people would
not liftifn to mifchief makers who fiionjd '-e
so impudent. It is neceli'ary to alarm the
people for the fafc-ty of the constitution, and
to persuade them that ill defi-rns are harbored
by its bc-ft friendsâthofe who introduced it
and who ifoxv' administer it. Accordingly
they have played upon the multitude, cau
tioning thera au.ainit the arts of the aristocrat'
and the monarchy men. But who are tbev i
They tell us, they are the high flying fede
raliftsâthe supporters of the corrupt monied
systems of Conor-Is. Now who are thole sup
porters of the measures of Congress. The
The President, the Governor of Pennfylvariia
and the great body of the people. The pub
lic has fern the Preiident's speech ; his lan
guage agrees with that used by the supporters
of the measures of Congress; he cxprefs'v
tells them that he will do every thing ip his
power to support thole measuresâin parti
cular the excite which the iucendiaries have
pretended no free people could or ought to
endure. The governor expressly ascribes the
happy fitnalion of Pennsylvania to the opera
tion of the national government, and fpfcnks
of the confidence placed in thÂ«t government
as well merited. Indeed, the Lcgiflature in
stead of being employed to raise taxes on the
citizens of the State, are chiefly concerned to
apply discreetly the surplus revenue wliiph
they draw from the Treasury of the National
government. The people of this State may
well be supporters of the federal caule as well
as of the government- The body of the peo
ple are in peace and (we have it on the high
est authority in our country) appear to be di(-
posed to support the laws of Congress It is
a poor trick to mention the ill designs of the
supporters of these laws when it thus appears
that the President and the body of the people
are included in this description. It foliows
clearly from a flight view of the conduct and
writings of the lall year that there is a partv
âit is to be hoped, not a large one, opptjfed
to the laws of the union aad to the sense of the
peopleâwho have tried by blackening the
government to make it change handsâriap
pily for our country they have tried in vain.

NO more let barbarous Memphis boast
Base rear'd by flavilh handsâ
A nation on the Atlantic coait
(Fetter'd no more in foreign bands)
A nobler Pyramid displays
Than Egypt's marble e'er could raise.
Columbia's sons, to extend a proof
Of their bold deeds to future years,
Disdain to uie such vulgar {tuff;
But, soaring to the itarry spheres,
Materials seek in Jove's blue sky
T' endure when I:rafs and marble die.
Arriv'd among the lhining host,
Fearless, the proud invaders spoil
From countless gems, in asther loft,
Some stars, to crown their mighty toil :
To heaven a pyramid they rear,
And point the fabric with a star.
Old waftful time ! though still you gain
Dominion o'er the brazen tower,
On this your teeth lhall gnaw in vain,
Finding its strength beyond their power â
While kindred stars in heaven lhall glow,
This Pyramid will shine below !

" YOl/R memorialills being informed,
that a chaplain is hired by the aflembly to at
tend the houle during the lefiion, and paid out
of the public trealury, they believe it right
for Â« iem to express their uneasiness at the
continuance of such a practice ; as well trom
conscientious scruples, as a beliei that it is
inconilftent with the spirit and intention of
the present constitution : they are however
far from wifh ; ng to discourage any from rhe
exercise of religious duties ; but being fully
persuaded that such a&s of devotion would
be as acceptable in the fight of the great ob
je& of adoration and worfliip, were they per
formed at the proper cxpence of thole who
may believe ir necefiary to hnve the alfiftiince
of a chaplain ; so they conceive no inconven
ience whatever can result from its becoming
a private instead of a public expeiiCe."

Saturday last the House of Representatives

A correlpondent observes, that Ihould the

the choice of Senators, they would so far an
nihilate their integrality as a branch in the

probable the state will continue unreprefent

In laurel'd majeftv serene,
Puie source of ev'ry boon, in ev'ry age a Queen !
But hark ! the rending prayer of pain /
What female flirieks aflault the car !
And whelm the poet's sacred ft rain,
And start the agonizing teai !
Where angel beauty* prostrate lies,
And godlike genius droops his head,
This by the foul-iefs Traitor dies,
That bv delpotic Faction bl< d !
On thee, mild Power, they madly call,
And all thy great endow ments claim,
Yet on thy mangled graces fall,
Apostate* to thy woiOup'd name !
Say, Nymph benign, wh?t ruffian race
Thy pure uublemifh'd glories ftain'd,
Deform'd thy hrav'n illumin'd face,
And ev'iy vcftal charm prophan'd !
To the vile rabble's rage rcfign'd
The lustre ot ihy poliHi'd miud !
Can Gallia's impious sons defame
The viitues of ihy fainted name,
And heap th' aflafliu's deeds on thee!
While to the sway of crimes alone,
High-seated on a recking thione,
They raise the liccns'd hand, and bend th' un-
Uallow'd knee.
Ah ! fee the fam'd difcov'rer \ bows
That head, by dcathlels myrtles crown'd.
And clasps those daring hands tn vain,
Which the world's circle widely bound.
And trae'd th' immeasurable main,
"thro' realms of parching heat, and worlds ol
withring fnowsi-
On the far ocean's defart shore,
His great advent"tons fell;
Vet mouiu thatfivagc deed no more,
No more that fateful flory tell,
e savage scenes on Gallia's patriot close,
In the warm bosom of repose,
His wile, his children, circling round !
By those, at whose behelfc he trae'd
The hostile plain, the foodlefs wafle,
While ev'ry outrag'd virtue flies,
h'd in his life's rich ft ream, the gallant Sailor
lies :
Pierc'd by ingratitude, to eaith he
bow'd,
While the mad clamours of the thankless
crowd
â  aim'd the fad tribute of each weeping wound
Amid the horrors of that morn
How was thy form degraded seen !
With all thy modi ft veftmenis torn,
How chang'd thy love-inspiring inein !
Around t hat brow 's m <jest c height
ev'ry milt that dames the night,
And midst those locks oi fl Â«wing gold,
An azure wreath of serpents roll'd,
And Irom that lip's ethereal balm,
And on that bread, with bounty warm,
Fell the red drops of treafui'd health,
W r hich from their rubi'd fountainsflow'd
In gems, whose blushing lultre glow'd
Rich with a Nation's vital wealth.
Theu to the criir.c-devoted coast
Thy tutelary power WdS loft :
In the rafli Defpot'a iranficnt hour,
Ok has thy guardian form appeared;
But midfl mad an arch's deaf'ning roar,
Ne'er can thy seraph strain be heard.
