THE PORTRAITâan extract
â¢' âHE returned from the fatigues of his br.'-
linefs at ten in the morning. His feelings call
ed loudly for the poisonous draught ; but the
well was dryâand no water could be had but
from a distant spring. He dispatched a servant
express with the pitcher. The bottle of rum
was on the table in readinessâthe weather was
hot, and his third was excefiive the moments
were anxiously courted, and rolled on more te
diously than they do when chided by an anxious
lover waiting for the mistress of all his affecti
ons.âHe took up a Gazette to cheat the delayâ
but the time was prolonged, for the servant had
broken the pitcher in his return from the spring,
and was afraid to provoke his mailer with the
disappointment ; lie therefore ran to buy ano
ther, but the fliop was ihut.
Charles walked the room in an agony ; but
contemplating on a fragment he had been read
ing in the Gazette, entitled the progress and ef
fects of drunkenness. It had made a deep im
pression on his inind, and held a mirror before
his eyes which gave him pain. His piclure, tak
en about three years before, was hanging in the
room. He viewed his image in the large glass,
and then turned and viewed the picture with
aftoniftunent. He counted the number of years
since he had been thrown on the canvass with
all the vigor and fprightlinefs of healthy man
hood ; and soon recollecting that none of his
neighbours, excepting two, who were intemperate
fats, had gone down the bill of life so fwiftly as
he had done. He was thus thrown by accident,
into a light, where he conld no longer conceal

Cliarlei was a man of finnnefs. He was ah

foul an enemy, or lo die nobly in the attempt.
Jnfpired with this noble resolution, lie no longer
waited for the return of the unfortunate pitcher,
but called for nib hoi fe, and went to his business,
nor did he ever inquire into the cause ot theler

EXTRACTS
" THERE is nothing more difguttfu! com
roonly to the judicious, than noisy controversy ;
and especially t hen the parties contending make
victory, and not truth their mair\ objert. When
a paper war ofiliis nature breaks out, luch wea
pons are used as are both mean and dilhonorable.
The auxiliaries of the combatants are burlelque,
and personal invec'tive ; which, .inllead of aid
ing, always injxire their caule. Fei lons who con
tend under the influence of fucli a temper, are
wont to all'ert things which are borh falle and
ridiculous in the view of their readers ; and like
two men engaged in atftual fight, every blow
they strike detra(ffs froiri their honor. The
greatest advantage that can accrue to readers of
lucli kind of writings, is lo them a more
striking idea of human depravity. And I be
lieve we :nay fafely fay, thac it is impoHible to
ascertain the merits of a cause, from writers of
this stamp. We may always llrongly fufpetft
that person to bcin the wrong, who, wiili all the
airs of dogmatism, proclaims his innocence and
cries down his antagonist ; and especially when
he has nothing but his bare ipfe dixit, to prove
his aflertions. Thac cause which requires scur
rility for its support, is a despicable caule indeed ,
to use it in a good cause, is execrable."
THE habit cfchewing tobacco, taking fnufF,
or finoking a pipe or fegars, {may be clalled a
mongst the inoft dirty, disagreeable habits that
a man can be fubjetfled to. However 101 l a man
may be to the sense of it himfelf, yet the use of
tobacco renders him very offenfive, and disagree
able to all them with whom he happens to be
near, and who are so fortunate as not to life the
nauseous weed. It inufl be peculiarly disagree
able to the ladies ; and they never fail to raise
the muscles of their face in disgust, when they
are near enough to take the breath of a smoker.
I have fat with pity, and overborne with coin

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF R E PRESENTJTIVES,
SATURDAY, March 24, 17911
MR. PAGE, in fupporc of Mr. Key's motion
to amend the bill (from the Senate) for
eflablifliing a mint, by striking out the words,
" representation of the head of the President ot
the United States for the time being, with an
infeription expreifing the initial or firlt letter ot
his christian or firlt name, and his fur-name at
length, the succession of the Presidency numeri
cally," and inferring an emblematical figure of
Libertyâsaid that it had been a priÂ»<stice in 1110
narchies, to exhibit the figures or heads of their
kings upon their coins, either to hand down in
the ignorant ages in which this practice was in
troduced, a kind of chronological account of
their kings, or to shew to whom the coin belong
edâWe have all read, added he, that the Jews
paid tribute to the Romans, by means of a coin
on which was the head of their CelarâNow as
we have no occalion for this aid to liiltory, nor
any pretence to call the money of the United
States the money of our Presidents, there can be
no fort of necelfity for adopting the idea of the
Senate. I second the motion, therefore, for the
amendment proposed ; and the more readily,
because I am certain it will be more agreeable to
the citizens of the United States, to fee the head
of Liberty on their coin, than the heads of Pre
sidentsâ However well pleased they might be
with the head of the great man now their Presi
dent, they may have no great reason tobepleaf
ed wi h fonie of his fucceflorsâas to him, they
have his buffs, his pictures are every whereâ
historians are daily celebrating his fame, and
Congrels has voted him a monumentâA further
compliment they need not pay him, especially
when it may be said, that no republic has paid
such a compliment to their chief ruagiftrareâ
and when indeed it would be viewed by the
world as a stamp of royalty on our coins â would
wound the feelings of many friends, and gratify
our enemies.
Mr. Williamfon seconded the motion also, and
affirmed that the Romans did not put the heads
of their consuls on their moneyâthat Jylius
Cefar wished to have his on the Roman coin, but
only ventured to cause the figure of an elephant
to be imprefled thereon, that by a pun 011 the
Carthaginian name of that animal, which found
ed like the name of Cefar, he might be said to
be on the coin. He thought the amendment
confident with republican principles, and there
fore approved of it.
Mr. Livermore ridiculed with an uncommon
degree of humor, the idea that it coqlcl be of any
consequence to the United States whether the
head of liberty were on their coins or not â the
President was a very good emblem of libertyâ
but what an emblematical figure might be, he
could not tellâA ghost had been said to be in
the shape of tlie found of a drum, and so might
liberty for aught he knewâbut how the Presi
dents head being on our coins could afFeJt the
liberty of the people, was incomprehensible to
him He hoped therefore that the amendment
would be rejected.
Mr. Smith of South-Carolina agreed with Mr.
Livei more in opinionâadding that the President
representing the people of the United States,
might with great propriety represent them 011
their coins. He denied that republics did not
place the images of their chief magistrates on
their coinsâand said he was surprised that a
member who so much admired the French and
their nesv conilitution, should be si averse to a
pi a.lice I hey have eftablifhcdâthe head of their
438
king is by their conftirutioli put upon their mo
ney -Behdes, it was It range that for a'circum
itance so trivial we should lose time indeVatinÂ®
and riJk the loss of an important bill.
The motion for striking slut was carried.
March 26.
The bill having been retm ned from the Se
nate, and the amendment proposed by tlieHoul'e
ili I agreed toâit was moved that the House fliould
recede tVom their amendment.
Mr. Livermure ftipported the motionâ-He laid
he did not conceive it poflible that any friend to
the President of the United States, the chief ma
gistrate, that great and good man, would have
refuted to pay every tribure of respect which
was justly due to himâwe have now a favorable
opportunity of complimenting him without any
shadow of flattery, and without any expenseâ
But instead of this, what is proposed ?âAn em
blematical figure of liberty^âBut what is this li
.berty which some appear to be so fond of !âHe
had no idea of Tuch liberty as appears to pollels
the minds of some gentlemenâit is little better
than the liberty of lavages, a relinquillnveiit of
all law that contradidts sr thwarts their passions
or desiresâHis idea of liberty was that which a
rose from law and jnltice, which secured every
man in his proper and social rightsâSome gen
tlemen may think a bear broke loose from .his
chain a fit emblem of libertyâothers may de
vise & different emblem, but Jie could not con
ceive that any of them would be applicable to
the situation of the United States, which jnftly
boasted of being always free.âlf any idea of an
emblem is necellary, he thought it might be ap
plied to the head of the President of the United
States. The present occasion affords the belt-op
portunity of doing honor to the man vÂ»e loveâ
instead of which we offer him an affrontâHe
could not reconcile this conducft to propriety or
confiftencyâfor while it is propofod to railea
monument to the memory ofthe Prefident,.which
will cost 50,000 guineasâa proposition to honor
him in a more efFe<ftnal manner, and in a way
which will be fatisfaÂ«ftory to the people, without
any expense, and with perfect security to their
liberties, is objevSed toâHe hoped the House
would recede.
Mr. Mercer replied to Mr. Livermore witli
some degree of afperityâl!e obfei ved that there
was a rule in the British House of Comtiions, iliac
the name of the king fiionld never be mentioned
in any debateâhe thought foine such rule migli:
be introduced with advantage into this Houle.â
In the course of his remarks, to fliew that the
circumstance of having theHrefident's head Itanip
ed on the coin could noc be justly considered as
doing him an honor, he said that persons of no
better character than a Nero, a Caligula or an
Heliogabulus, may ewjoy it as well as a Trajan,
&c.
Mr. Senev animadverted with severity on the
remarks offered by Mr. Livermore, and on the
conduit of the Senate ; particularly in returning
the bill with a negative to the amendment of the
House, within a period that left them no time to
deliberate on the reafotis which might have in
fluenced the House.
Mr. Giles opposed the morion for receding
He adverted to the ideas which are connected
with the business in European countries ;i"
President's head will not designate the govern
ment said he, there is to be but one head, but
does not our government coniift of three parts .
Is there any other head proposed to be oil the
coin but the President's ? He said this circniu
(lance was of a piece with the firfl a A of the Se
nateâ it had a near affinity to titles, that dai ling
child of the Senate, which lias been put to nui.e
âwith an intention that it (hall be announce
at foine future period in due form.
Mr. Senfon said he supposed he should be ex
tremely disorderly were he to mention the mo
tives which influenced the Senate in their di cu
fiorisâhe knew not what they were, nor Â«as n
of importance that he fhould âHe then oblervet
that plain pieces of metal will not answer or
money, some impression is neceflary to guai >i
gainst counterfeitsâHe fiid the Senate have < e
terinined what the device {lull beâbut the iou
bv their amendment, have left the mattei entire
ly to the judgment of the artifl, who may
such an emblem as suits his fancy. Mi. Â° ,
ridiculed the idea of the people s being
by their Presidentsâand much less by his iÂ»' a S
on their coin. . , . f
Mr. Page replied that he was sorry to find t M
some gentlemen endeavored to ridicule re l>"
can cautionsâhe thought that both in< -
and inconsistent with their fitualions, as weir
highly impoliticâHe confefl'ed that as o'g
the people were sensible of the blessings o 1
ty, and liad their eyes open to watch end
uients, they would not be enftaved , 111 1
fliould ever ftiut them, or become inalte "" ,
iheir interests and the true princip es o .
government, they, like other nations,
lose their liberties âthat it was the t uty
members of that House to kee|> the eyes; o
constituents open, and to watch o*er t â¢
tiesâit was therefore unbecoming atreit with levity, aivi to ridicule any feiMiii-iits which had th.it
tendencyâFor his part, he thought ic the peculiar duty of the
representatives of a free people, to put the'ii upon their guard a
gamil.any thing which could po'.libly endanger their libecues â
that with this view he warned his conftitucms of the d mger, nt
merely of imitating the flattery, and almost idolatrous practice of
monarchies, with relpect to the honor paid to their kings by im
prelling their images and names on their coins, but he wilhed to
add as few incentives as poflible to competitors tor the President's
placeâHe warned his country againlfc the cabals the corruption and
animosities which might be excited by th e intrigues of ambitious
.men. animated with the hopes of handing their names down to
the Jatclfc ages on the medals of their country. âBut this indi(cri
minate honor is unworthy of the President's acceptance ; a Nero,
a Caligula an Hcliogabulus it has been observed (by Mr. Meroei)
may enjoy it as well as a Trajanâto apply it to the preienc chief
niagiftrate alone would be less exceptionable ; but this would be
highly improper, for if he should pass an ast for this purpose it
might blast his reputation. lam of opinion that the Senate knw
his delicacy would not permit him to pass such an oneâtliev have
therefore extended the compliment to ail his lucceflois. We are
under obligations to the great man now our Pi'efidentâ but a lover
of liberty and friend to the rights of man, would be cautious
how he (hewed his sense of that obligation. As a triend to the
Prelident. I am unwilling to offer him a compliment, which if
accepted might damn his reputation-âWere I in his place, I
would cut off my hand rather than it should figu the ast as it now
HandsâWere I his greaieft enemy, I should wilh him to pass it
as it was palled by the Senate. Sir, lam as much his friend as
the member from New-Hampdiire, and hdve lhewn at proper
times and places that I was so. lam too lenfible of the honor
our Pieftdent has acquired, to suppose that an unbecoming com
pliment can in any degrcÂ» contribute to its increaseâ I hope,
therefore, the amendment will not be recedcd from which the
House has made.
A few remarks were made by fevf ral other gentlemen, and then
the queflion for receding being put, it was negatived.

Philadelphia, May 16.
By the Birmingham Packet, Captain Simmons > from Bristol,
European accounts are received to the 10th March. In addition
to the articles under the foreign head, the following abltraft is
gn en:â
Great exertions are making in Scotland and England to effedl
he abolition of the slave-trade ; a great number of petitions were
o be presented to Parliament on the fubje6tâ twenty were pre
ifnted the 5' h March. It is not ex peeled that Mr. H tilings' trial
will be finiftied during the orefent fefiion. March 6, the dele
gates from the provincial diflenters met in London, and deter
mined not to renew their petition to Parliament for the repeal of
the test and corporation a6ls. The prelent complicated Hate of
European politics, and the continued apprchenhon of innovations
in her own government, arefaid to have occasioned the derange
ment in the intellects of the Queen of Portugalâif this is fail, we
are furniihed with a second female viÂ£liin to the Frcnch revolu
tion. Conspiracies are forming in the Ruffian empire, which
threaten a revolution in that countryâthis fcory sprang up imme
diately on the death of Potcmkin, and has been circulating ever
since! French aflignats now lose 70 per cent, and it is expos
ed they will soon be at 100. 11 The monthly deficit has been for
a long time taiher more than 30 millions of livresâThe extraor
dinary bank has furnifhed the treasury with nearly two thouf.iud
millions livres since the revolution, or eighty millions sterling"â
A limilar (lory to this has been told for more than 18 months
part! and vet the revolution progressesâTime alone tells the
rruch. The Popery Bill palled the Irilh House of Lords una
nimouflvââ¢ on which oceafion, mapy fentiincnts fell from mem
bers which did honor to their heads and hearts. James Mapper
Tandy, a leading character in I>iblin, having challenged a mem
ber of Parliament, the Solicitor-General, an order was ilTued for
taking him into custodyâhe was accordingly apprehended, but
made his escape. James Mapper Tandy is about fixtv years of
a _ . J- â  , ,
The South of France is in a state of efFervefcence-â an article
under the Pans head fays, if the Spaniards lhould enter France,
they would be received with open arms.âN. B. All forts of
newspapers are printed in Paris.
Paris itfelf is reprcfcnted as in a state of cotfifufionâno day
pitting without some riot. Foreign powers arc drawing their
armies towards the frontiers of Franceâthis circumstance, with
mhpis, lead to a belief that â¢* war is inevitable." By a manifefto
of the ex-princes and nobles of France, which has been published,
the Courts of Russia, Turin, Madrid, Vienna and Berlin, are to
guarantee certain parts of the French Couftiiutionâfo that at
any rate the people are to be benefited by the revolution.
DoÂ£tor Willis, it is said, is sent for to attend the Queen of Por
tugalâ his fee to be 20,c001, whether his prcfcripiions arc fuc
ccfsful wr uot.
The Georgia Gazette, received by the last veflel, contains the
charge of the Hon. James Iredell to the Grand Jury of the Cir
cuit Court of that State, published at the request of the Juryâ
who, in their address to the Judge, fay-â u We recommend to
Congress a total repeal of the excise laws, conceiving them op
preflive and dangerous in a free country, and the word mode of
taxation that can be devised by an) government."
We have frequently observed, that fubfequcnt accounts from
the frontiers contradict those of a prior date. A letter from
Major M'Culiy, dated at Pmfburgh the sth inil. fays, that the In
dians have been troublesome on that and on the frontier ol Virgi
nia, but have not done so much damage as has been represented in
the Putfburg Gazette of 281b ApiiUâthat Gazette fays,that many
of Capt. Paul's men aÂ»e not armed. The Major fays, this is a
mifreprefgntation. When Capt. Paul marched out, he had 72
good rifles 111 his company, fix only ot his mer. weie without
nfies ; and that at present there is not a man in the corps unarm
ed, and but 31 mujkcts in ail. The lbldiers are kej>t continually
icouting, and the fpiea always out.
Yefterdav the honorable Junes Iredell and Nathaniel Pen
dleton, Elqrs. gave judgment in the Circuit Court, in the in
teresting cafe wherein Samuel Brail sforcl and others were
p'aintiffs, and James Spalding defendant. One of the plaintiffs
(Mr. Brailsford) was a real British fubjeet, being a native of
Great-Britain, and having resided there from 1767 to 1784,
and the other plaintiffs were citizens of South-Carolina, whole
property (with an express exception of their debts) was confis
cated in that state. The judges gave their opinions, with
their reasons at large, and the substance of their opinions was,
that, as Mr. Brailsford's debts were only sequestered by a
law of the state, upon which no further proceedings had taken
place, the* treaty of peace, as confirmed by the constitution of
the United States mult have the effe<st of an express repeal of
that part of the act of a.Tembly which had created an impedi
ment to his recovery ; and*that there was no bar in refpedt to
the recouery of the other plaintiffs, inasmuch as, under the act
of aflembly of this state afib&ing them, their debts were not
confjfcated, because their debts had not been confifcated In the
iiate of South-Carolina, the ast of alfembly of this state mak
ing citizens of other states liable to the fame measure cf for
feiture (and no other) in this state, as in their own. They
therefore gave judgment for the plaintiffs.
South-Carolina accounts, a-, late as the third of May, men
tion many additional instances of distress, from the floods of
rain that fell in that state the beginning of April. It is re
markable that this happened about the fame time with those
heavy rains in the Weft-Indies, which did so much damage in
the i.lands of Nevis, St. Eullatius, &rc. Many particulars of
devaluation, from the extraordinary swell of the rivers, are
enumerated in the Carolina prints, of which we ihall only men
tion the following:âThe Congaree was raised to such a height
a ; to overflow an eminence on the banks of that river, which
had been used by the Indians, from time immemorial, for a
burying place. The rapidity of the current dillodged the ske
letons from their place of interment, carrying off a great part
of the foil, and leaving disclosed to view, a variety of curious
urns, rude images of birds and beasts, wampum, bows and
arrows, stone battle-axes, Bcc. &c. affording a quantity of cu
riolities of this kind, not unworthy the notice of the philol'o
pher.âlt is probable a similar swell in the Congaree river has
not happened for many ages since ; had this eminence been
fubjeft to an overflow, the aborigines of the country would
never have clrofcn it for a burying ground. Nat. Gaz.
The intended bridge over Rock-Creek, opposite the Federal
City in Virginia, is now begun, under the immediate dire&ion
of Mr. Harbaugh.
Yesterday tiie.Legiflature oP the State of New-Jcrfey met at
Trenton, for the dispatch of bublic business.
Tlie affairs of Hifpaniola still wear a gloomy afpeftâdiffcntion
among the %vhites strengthens the temerity of the insurgents ; and
so little head has lately been made against them, that very serious
apprehensions are entertained respecting the fate ot the whole of
the French poffeflions there.
On Friday last the Governor of this Hate laid the corner stone
of the President's House in Ninth-street. The following inscrip
tion is on the itone :
At a commencement held in the University of Pcnnfylvania on
the 1 ith inft. the following young gentlemen were admitted to
the degree of Batchelor of Arts, viz. Benjamin Chanipneys, Jona
than Holmes, and Samuel Moore, of New-Jeifey ; Eboiezer

medicine, and defended their theories againll the objc&ions of
the Medical Faculty in publ c on the day of commencement.
S.*VAfCNAH, May 3.
Monday lafl a letter i/as received at the Coffce-houfe, from
tie convention of Pilots aiiembled at Marcus-Hook, dated
Mi/ 12th, dire-fled to the Gentlemen, Merchants of Philadel
phia, enclo.lng a copy of tbren resolutions they have agreed to.
T:ie fubftmce of these resolutions, as well as we can rccol
l *c c t, i; as fjllo vs :âTaat velfels drawing 12 feet and under
ftiall piy 7-,. 6.1. for every half fjot, veffeis drawing upwards
of 12 f.*et, 12;. 6.1. per half Velfels not registered in
the United States, 235. That the pilot who has brought up
a veifel, .'hall be entitled to carry her down, unless the owner
can oier a fuficient reason to the Wardens why he Ihould not.
That yelTels of less than 5) tons refuting to take a pilot, lhall
pay half pilotage, to go to the fund for the support of widows
and children of pilot . If a pilot of the firft order be taken to
sea, through stress of weather, he lhall be allowed yi. 10s. per
month until brought back t > Philadelphia j a pilot of the se
cond rank, 5!. per month; and one of the third, 41. If a pilot
b? taken away intentionally and inaliciouflv, the Captain shall
forfeit and pay sdl. and the owners 3031. âthat they lhall be
allowed 20s. a day for the use of their boat, Ihould itbe wanted
by their employers ; and 15s. a day when detained for them
selves.
A refpe&able meeting of Merchants took up these refolu
t ions, and resolved, unanimously, that no further notice should
be taken of them.
Indeed, if a combination of the kind, entered into without
warning, Ihould be produ<stive of success, they might be 4o fre
quent as to prove of great detriment to the interests of com
merce, and merchants would be obliged to state, as a condi
tion to the dispatch of their velfels, not only wind and weather,
but Pilots permitting. Gctt. Adv.
Weft-India prints abound with circumstantial accounts of
the disasters that have happened in several of the Windward
J (lands, in conlequence of the floods of rain that more or less
fell in those parts, from the beginning till near the middle of
April. The town of BalTeterre, in St. Kitts, has fuft'ered le
verely by the torrents of water, which rushed down from the
mountains, and carried almost every thing before them. Nevis
has luffered lightly ; but at St. Euftatius the effects of this de
luge of rain were tremendous; where the whole loss is esti
mated at near 33,000 joes, besides several lives; amongst
which, unfortunately, was not included that of a baker, who
immediately after this devastation of nature, advanced three
stivers upon the price of each loaf.
This corner stone was laid
on the ioth day of May, 1792.
The State of Pennsylvania out oi debt
Thomas Mifflin, Governor.
It was intimated by some writer that the public debt in
creased like the muftlrodm under the hand of night, by the in
strumentality of the speculators. In answer to this it was
said, who that can read, will believe that the speculators
made their own certificates, or increased the sums of them? It
is a fact well known, that in some of the northern dates, such
tranfa&ions were frequently pra&ifed, and we know many
were imposed 011 with the altered certificates, and I would
thank lome of your readers who can give information, to let it
be known whether they could, in all cases, be detected when
they were offered for funding? Nat. Gaz.
All experience shews that the cryagainft men in power pro
ceeds from a pure love of the public. The complainers have
no desire to take the places of the bad men they are writing
at. Not being ambitious of power, having 110 cabals or in
trigues, they attempt to raise diflurbance merely for the fake
of peace and tranquilityâthey write against men and mea
sures, merely to reconcile the people to the government â
they show how imperfect its form, how dangerous the tenden
cy of its powers to the (late governments, to liberty and vir
tue, and the rights of man, merely to manifeft their ardent at
439
tachment to the constitution* their reverence for its princi
ples, and their firm resolution never to lose fight of it.
Ail this they tell usâand their word, added to what experience
shews, inuft fatisfy us that nO manner of doubt can be enter
tained in regard to their real sentiments !
There are some persons who make it a principle to believe
all they fee in print. But of late, tiiofe who call themselves
the friends and admirers of the government, but who really
are the constant and bitter revilers of its me a lures and oiticers,
have thrult down the gapingthroat of credulity so many choak
ing morsels, that their faith will certainly be strangled. Many
think it fafer to refufe credit to all they fee in print. One of
the moffc difficult things to believe is the pretence of the'e
men, that they love and admire what they take so much pains
to make appear detestable.
