EDUCATION
AN EXTRACT.
A FEW men of wit, who, in a
long intercourse with the fash
ionable world, probably for
gotten that little knowledge of the
ancient languages and authors,
which they had acquired at school,
have endeavored to bring into dis
credit the prevailing mode of edu
cation, which devotes much time to
the study of Giecian and Roman li
terature. Poflefled of natural parts,
they have perhaps, besides, enjoyed
all those advantages of good com
pany and extensive commerce jvith
the living world, which both excite,
and give occasion to display, great
abilities. They became, therefore,
d iltinguifhed characters in their
time, though their (olid attainments
were few, and greatly defective.
But, whatever figure they made,
they would have shone with ft ill
greater lustre, if they had retained
a tincture of that elegance and li
berality of sentiment, which the
mind acquires by a study of l he clas
sics, and which contributes more to
form the true gentleman, than the
Aabftituted ornamentsof modern af
fectation.
The example of these illustrious,
but fupeificial perloiifges, has in
duced every prater, who has been
tauc;ht to Idp broken French, a;-d
dance a minuet, to laugh at the lub
berly boy, as he calls him, who
spends a dczen years at school, in

learning Greek and Latin. He un
fairly represents this time, as spent
ii acquiring the languages alone ;
ignorant that a taste is often form
ed in it for those authors, who are
able to furnifh the purest and the
mo ft elegant pleasures during the
remainder of life.
The pert vivacity of allured ig
norance has often persuaded the
fond mother to discard the tutor for
the dancing mailer ; to be more fo
licitons that the hopes of the fami
ly, the heir, perhaps, to a tide, an
estate, and even a lhare of legisla
tion, ftould be taught to hold up
his head, than be furnifhed with
those ideas and principles, which
would render him truly happy in
hiinfelf, ami an honor and advan
tage to his friends and to his coun
try.
Even among those who are fully
sensible of the neccifity of improv
ing the beauties of the mind, as
well as the graces vf the person,
there prevails a precfilecftion for
modern languages and modern li
terature to the exclusion of the an
cient. 111 the idea of these, a fuf
ficient stock of historical knowledge
is to be gained by an attention to
the events of the two or three lalt
centuries ; and a fufficiqnt acquain
tance with philosophy, and polite
learning, from a perusal of the
writers of France and Italy. Col

I lie hiltoi iaii of * cincy. .w ! '
ply tlic place of Herodotus, Thinj
dides, and Livy. Aiiollo, Tallo,
and Bpilean, aie to be read in pie'
lerence to Homer, Virgil, and Ho
race ; and the works of Voltaire
alone, ro be fubftiiuted in the place
of all the poetry, all the philosophy,
and all the hiltory that ever has
been written. In conftquence of
these mistaken notions, our greac
grammar fehools, which have pro
duced so many ornaments of human
nature, are exploded by many, as
the feats of illiberal manners and of
antiquated learning.
With refpeft to the charge that
illiberal manners are the difgrace
ful charai'teriftics of boys educated
ill grammar schools, I must confels
I am plea fed with the natural ftm
plicity of that age of fpriglulinefs
and inexpe-ience ; nor do 1 know a
fight more truly ridiculous, than
that of a boy of fourteen affecting
the grates, and behaving among
his Superiors in age and attainments,
with all the difguiliug ease of fcif
fufficiency.
The fame natural good sense
which makes the boy ac't in charac
ter, will teach the man a manly be
havior. And I believe every judi
cious person had rather fee his lon,
while very young, partaking in the
noisy miith of his school fellows,
than bowing and grinning in the
insipid circle of a card party.
With refpeot to the other charge,
that a learned education is a liitle
out of falhion in some polite circles,
we confefs and lament that ii is true.
Bnt though we allow fulhiun to dic
tate without' controul the exn<l ili
menllons of a buckle or a head
dress ; yet a regard for the honor
and happiness of human nature, in
duces us to dispute her sovereign
authority in tliofe things, on which
depend the manners and sentiments
of a riling generation.
If, however, it is gianteil, that
the true gentleman, that is, the
man of enlarged notions and poliih
ed taste, cannot, by any method of
education, be so well formed, as by
the clalfical ; yet it by no means
follows, that thole whose happiness
mull, in a great measure depend on
less coniprehenfive views of men and
things, fituti 1d be iuftruCied in the
lame mode. The time thatisufual
ly spent in Lilly's grammar, and in
acquiring just so much knowledge
of the Latin language as may in
spire a young man with vanity, but
which cannot enable him to enter
into the spirit of the author, is cer
tainly ill bestowed. He who is de
signed for the common walksof life,
had much better be reading Win
gate's arithmetic than Cordery's
colloquies, and learning the rule of
three than the rules of syntax.

LONDON, October 6.
Two letters, one fro-n the Commifliorers
sent to the Camp at Chalons, and another
from Gen Dumourier, were read in the con
vention, stating, that the enemy continued to
retreat, ard that the road behind them was
strewed with dead bodies. On visiting the
camp, which they had quitted,3oo horses were
found dead and haljeaten.
These letters farther stated that there
were 8000 Tick in the Hospital General at
Grand Pre, and 5000 at Verdun. Gen. Du
mourier was of opinion that the enemy could
neither winter at Verdun nor Longwy, and
that they would effect their retreat through
Luxemburgh.

The inhabitants of Newburyport, i
and the community at large, may
with propriety be congratulated on
the completion of this very valua
ble public convenience ; which,
whileit furnifhes one, among many
evidences of the flourifhing Hate of
our country, reflects much honor on
the propi ietors, as well as those who
with so much spirit have executed
it. When it is coDfidered that this
bridge has been built, under the
profpecft of advantsges much less en
couraging than any which have been
granted by the legiflatnre to under
takings ot a similar kind ; that,from
unforefeen circumilances in the ex
ecution, the expense has arisen to 1
nearly twice the sum at which it
was calculated, and that the whole
has been effected in the short space
of seven months, and in a stile far
exceeding any thing of the kind,
hitherto eflayed in this country, it
will be acknowledged that too much
can hardly be said of the liberality
and perseverance of the proprietors,
or of the ingenuity and industry of
the artificeis.
The two large arches of this bridge
w ere executed from a model invent
ed by Mr. Timothy Palmer, an in
genious houfe-wright of this town)
& appear to unite elegance,ftrength
and firinnels, beyond the molt san
guine expectation.
To the grateful acknowledge
ments of the proprietors.iinanimouf

President of the board of direcflors,
the public have, with united voice,
added their zealous applause, for
his unwearied personal attention to
this undertaking, through its whole
prugrefs.
ALBANY, Dec. 3
Judge Hofmer of Ontario county,
arrived in this city on Saturday lalt,
from the Genefee cÂ«untry, and has
been so obliging as to communicate
to us the important and highly in
teresting intelligence ofatiuce hav
ing been concluded between the
holtile Indians and the United
Mates, on which we take the liberty
of felicitating our countrymen.
He fays, the chiefs of the Six Na
tions, deputed and comniiffioncd by
the President of the United States
on a million to the hostile tribes, af
fem bled in council at the Miami vil
lage* are returned home, bavin*
happily succeeded in bringing about
(reflation of arms between The laid
Indians and the United States âto
continue till the spring of 179; ;
and that, in the interim, they arc
ready and willing to enter into ne
gociations with commissioners, on
the part of Coi.giefs, for bringing
about and establishing a firm "and
laliing pe.ice \\ ith the United States
I he (aid chiefs add, that the In
dians at the council, contrary to
nioft fri'guine expectation*,
7y\

received them with a great deal of
cordiality, itiling tl.ein their elder
brothers, and treating them as Inch
in the molt courtly &I. lendiy man
ner ; and that they paid every pÂ«>l
iible degree of refpeiJt and atteiui
on tothe talks which were delivered
them from the Prefi.lent of the
United States.
The above information was re
ceived in the Gsnefee fetrleme'nt
(as might well be expedt;d) v.ith
the highert degree of I'aiisfatftion ;
and it has already given a new
spring to the spirit of improvement,
as well as to all kinds of business
in that new and flourishing part of

ferred to a committee of the whole.
A motion for itsbeingmade the order of the
day, th 15 day week, was opposed. Mr. Murriy
objected to so early a day. The fubje&, kid he,
is important: the ft ate of Maryland has a right
to fix votes in this House : it so happens, that
four feats of the representation from that state,
are vacant. He wilhed, therefore, that a more
distant day may he appointed; as, in that cafc
it was highly probable, that state would be more
fully represented. Other reafoifs for a more
distant diy, were urged by fevcral gentlemen.
Tn-sday fortnight was finally agreed to.
The House took, into confidcration the amend
ments by the committee of the whole to the
coasting bill. They agreed to some of the
amend . ents reported, with amendments; o
thers were' reje&ed. A elauf* was proposed
to be added requiring from the owners, or mas
ters of veflels, a particular enumeration of all the
goods, wares and merchandize transported in the
several coaihng vellcls from time to time. This
occasioned some debate : it was objc&ed to as
involving a great and unrec.fiary expence,
without affording a correfponciing benefit:
tending to obftru& the coasting tra-e, foasal
moft to destroy the lame ; it was Lid, it wouid
be nugatory, being, in mar.y irapradica
ble. The clause was supported, as conducive to
information relative to the produ&s k real ton
fumptiÂ«ns of t> efeveral states; points, on which
very different opinions were entertained: that
the expencc would not probably be more than
the addition of one Clerk to the Treasury De
partment : that the duty would devolve on the
colle<scors; and be a business of course, 3tc. The
motion was at length withdrawn. Some \ erbal
corre# ions were made n several fe&ioni; and
then, by general consent, the bill was laid on the

The amend menu of the Senate ic. ihc bill

Mr. Steele moved the following resolution :
That the Secretary of War be dire&edto lay

oncd officers, non-comniifiGoned officers and
privates belonging to the regular eftablifliment
of the Uni:ed State*, fpecifying the regiments
or corps to which they belong, and the time of
their entering the service.
This motion was agreed to.
In committee of the whole, on the eflimate

The chairman observed, that the fuhjed was
before the committee without an/ fpctinc pro

Mr. Kitchell moved, that thÂ« committee
should rife report the resolutions submitted
some time since.
It being remarked that these refutations were
yet to be determined on, having never tÂ»ccn re
ported to the House : they wereagain real: and
then a motion for the committee to rife and re
port, was made, and agreed to. The committee
accordingly rose and reported the refolurions,
which were taken into confederation by the
House. The items of the eft!mate were again re
cited the sum in the estimate for the sup
port and expences of the loan-offices, occafloned
considerable conversationâthe accounts of the
several loan-offices were again called for; that
front the officer at New-York being rtfad,itwas
remarked that the amount of this account ex
ceeded that of Pennsylvania, and indeed of all
the other accounts. This disparity, it was said,
very extraordinary, and did rfiot appear to
be accompanied with any fufficient reasons, for
so great a difference; and though the ac
counts had been fettled by the proper officers of
the Treasury, yet that they were liable to bere
vifed by the House.
Some remarks in opposition were made.
The quetlion on agreeing to the sum reported
in the estimate for the loan offices was carried in
the affirmative

The amendments of the Senate to the bill
providing for the registering and recording of
(hip's or veC'ls, were taken into consideration.
Thefirit, second and third amendments were
a -rrecd to. Tlie fourth amendment was to
strike out the 17th section of the bill, which
was designed to guard effcftually_ against col
lusion in regard to American vefielsâit hav
ing been al'certained that impositions in this
refpeft had been praftift-d with i'uccefs. The
amendment of the Senate was objected toâit
was said it left the door fcill open to the own
ers of foreign vessels to evade payment of so.
reign tonnage. Mr. Goodhue, Mr. William
fon, Mr. Sedgwick, Mr. Parker and Mr. Ma
dison, oppoled the amendment.
Mr. Fitzfimons appeared to be partially
in favor of the amendment âhe observed that
there was no clause in the Britifli navigation
law, equally rigid with that proposed in the
bill, and which the Senate have objected toâ
He observed that the policy of - such restricti
ons as went to discourage the building of ves
sels in the United States, may well be doubt
ed but thoug'i he was not perfectly fatisficd
with the clause in the bill, yet he; Ihould not
vote to concur with the Senate.âMr. \V.
Smith said he agreed with the gentlemen from
Pennsylvania in his remarks, but Ihould draw
a very different conclufion âand ihould there
fore bein favor of concurring with the Senate
âbut if the House fliould not be disposed to
concur, he enquired whether the proposal to
strike out the clause could not be adopted,
without agreeing to the substitute ?âMr.
Barnwell was in favor of concurring with the
Senate.âMr. Parker opposed the amendment
âhe said the operation of the proposed clause
from the Senate, might tend to encreafe the
-building of American veifels, but would'
jnoft certainly tend to the injury of the mer- '
cantile interest in generalâThe collusions al
luded to- by gentlemen, he observed,
, had undoubtedly taken placeâand if there is
notfome effeVftual provifton, like that in the
bill, adopted, the commerce of the United
States in a few years would be transferred to
foreigners altogether. Mr. Madison was op.
posed to the amendmentâhe added a few re
marks corroborative of the feutiments de
livered by Mr. Parkerâand then tlje queftioa
being pat, the amendment of the Senate was
disagreed to.
A me flu ge was received from the Senate,
by Mr. Otis, their Secretary, informing the

A corrcfpondent obierves, that the hint
Xhrou-n out in a late r,umber of the Mai], re-
Ipeitinj;a fupplyofgiain ior our aljies at Mar
seilles, is indicative of t!;e benevolence and
patriotism of tie writer; as fiich, it must
.meet flip approbation of ail good men.
The hint, however, is susceptible nl' im-
: it is reported that the ri(e in the
p. icc of gram will operate so advantageously
for the planters arid farmers in the fptitheni
states, wiiere the crops have been very great,
and are principally on band, particularly in
the ancient dominion, that the circumstance
will make a difference of a million of dollars
in favor of that state. Now, Mr. printer, if
your correfpopilent had extended his idea to
that state, probably his own, and had proposed
an alfociation Ct:crc to guard against the ava
ricious practices of mercantile monopolizers,
similar to thatfuggefted withfo much candor,
for this city, I thinkhis plan would have been
more coinpleat as well as more uniform.
But, in order to he confident, lie onght
to have gone to the fountain head of supplies,
and warned Jame prr/ovs, if auy luch there
were, tp be thus warned,againft the extortion
of the farmers, the original holders of the
article; for it may very rationally be sup
posed, that t'nefe will be very naturally dis
posed to avail themlelves of an advantage

attempted so palliate and juftify the conduct
of the Sieur Malvaut, and has refufed to give
up the flute, flie being, as he pretends, a
King's vessel ran away with by Monsieur de
la Carriere, who, with the troops under his
command,have come tothefe islands to spread
the discord which ravaged St. Domingo, and
was a fit commanding officer for men detach
ed from a body that were now their
facfilegious hands on the King, and had de
clared the fame aniinofitv to .ill Kings ; pre
tending also, that the Flute was too leaky to
venture to sea, and offering to fend two trans

the world they think proper to go, provided
they leave theft Peas, threatening at the fame
time to watch them narrowly with his fciua

cept of the offer of the two transports, but in

fliips they have now here, will be able to con
vey them to any port they please.
Mr. Malvaut, we are told, now denies his
having sent any challenge to Captain Byron,
previous to his being captured by that gen

Among other attributes which Mr. de Ri

To THOMAS MIFFLIN,

, Sir,
THE continuance and encreafe of general
prnfperitv, the honorable discharge of our pe
cuniary engagements, and the extensive pro
gress of public and private improvements,
throughout the Commonwealth, whilst they
afford to our fellow citizens the strongest evi
dence of the wisdom of our political institu
tions, must also impress their minds with the
most favorable fentimerts towards those from
whose virtue and ability in the administration
of government, the principles of our constitu
tion, and the mandates of our laws, derive
their fulleft and most beneficial operations.
We join y6u in lamenting that in any part
of the Union, unwarrantable oppolition has
been made to the measures of a government
founded on principles of equality and free
dom, and brought into exilic nee by the free
and unbialTed voice of the people ; but are at
the faille time happy to learn, that the result
of your enquiries, how far the citizens of
Pennsylvania have been concerned in any ri
otous or violent opposition, is, that you have
found the instances of outrages but few, that
the oflenoers have been generally pro/ecuted,
ar.d that in every ca<e of a prosecution, le
gally fnpported, conviction and puniflinient
have ensued.
Imp re fled with the necessity of a drift and
faithful attention to our federal obligations,
we allure you of our hearty concurrence in
any legal measures which may be adopted, to
allay the spirit of di(content, to cultivate the
the means cf harmony, to repress every Ipe
cies of unjuftifiable opposition to the laws of
the Union, and to excite merited confidence
in the measures of the general government,
The remaining objects of your addrels shall
receive an attention proportioned to their ur
gency and importance; in affording which, we
shall proceed with confidence and alacrity, re
l>ing on the support of our confHtuent.s, and
your aid and concurrence in every measure
directed to the promotion of their happinels
and prosperity.

The party writers have no resource in this
dry time for matter of complaint, but to set
up the old (ing-song about the growth of mo
narchical principles and the diftinftion of re
publican and anti-republican parties. It is
lamentable tor them, as their whole business
and delight is to find fault, that the conduct
of government futilities little occasion for
their trade. The Prcfident, the Governor of
Pennfylvaoia, and the body of the citizens
expressly approve of whatCongj-efs lias done
it only remains to (hew what mifchjef the le
gislature, and thole who support it inttvd to do.
This is poor doings for the partyâit is living
on the wind, on the mere smell of the ('call
which they actually ei joy when government
commits an error or fufFers a misfortune.
However, if it were not for hope, the heart
would break. Accordingly every effort is
making to alarm the people with jealousies
against government. They have tried to
new vamp the worn-out story of a monarchy

King kept concealed in a cage like the lion,

Dols. Cts.
It is neerly two years since the public con
fidence in some of tlÂ»c lHufl diftinguilhed ~-
triots of our country began to be aflailed, by
the publicat on of the most impudent, inde
cent and slanderous attacks from the pens of
envy andmaliee.âlt is said, " no fair appeal
has been made to the public on the compara
tive merits of Mr. Adams aud M . Clinton."
That no fair appeal has been made, is abun
dantly evident; but that the inoft unremitted
endeavors were ufed,and themoft unfair means
resorted to,to prtj udiee the publicmind against
the Vice-Preiident, all America bears witness.
Happy for our country's honor, freedom and
happinefr, it appears, that the business has
turned out diredly the reverse of what was
intended. So true it is, that tho' there is no
end to be exposed to the clamors of* a pavty
spiritâyet a lying tongue is but for a mo
ment.

GEOGRAPHY.
Mathew Carey
RefpeÂ£lfuliy submits to the Citizens of the United
States, the following
PROPOSALS
FOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION'.
An AMERICAN EDITION of
Guthrie's Geography
IMPROVED.
Of which theje are the terms :
1. TT (hall be pubtilhed in 48 weekly numbers,
X each containing thiee Iheets,or twenty-four
pages, of letter press, in quarto, printed with new
types on fine papei.
11. In the course of the work will bedelivered
about thirty large maps, of the fame size as those
in the European editions, viz. mod of them sheet
maps on poll paper.
(p?" Bejtdes the maps in the Britijh editions, this
work will contain maps of as many of the United States
as can be readily procured, executed by the bell engrav
ers in the United States.
111. The price of each number will be a quar.
ter dollar, to be paid on delivery. No ad.
vance required.
IV. The work will be put to press as soon as
700 copies are fublcribed for.
V. Sublcribers who disapprove ol the work, on
the publication of the three firft nutnbeis, are to
be at liberty to return them, and fliall have theii
money repaid.
VI. The fubferibers' names shall be prefixed as
patrons of the undertaking.
Perhaps there is no science more entertaining
and uleful than geography. It reveals the difco
venes of travellersâthe remarkable curiofitiet of
all countries, in nature and artâthe fttuation ot
provinces, c.lics, towns, villages, livers, & moun
tainsâin fine, the history, manners, customs, laws,
forces, revenues, and government of diffeient na-
tions.
It is an old observation, that " there is not a
son or daughter nf Adam, but has tome concern
with g-ography;" and that a knowledge of this
fciencc IS indispensable towards the study of liif.
lory with advantage or fatisfaftion. indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannot discourse on the
mo ft common topics of the day without
betraying his ignorancc.
So much for geography generally. With re-
Ipccl to the present plan, let it fuffice to remark
that Guthrie's Geography has been long acknow.'
I edged to be the best in the Englift language â 
however, the account of America u, â has, from
obvious reasons, been very erroneous and defec
"q'j Th< : errorsof former editions will be cor
