A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAY:. AND SATURDAYS BY fOHN FENNO, No. 69, HIGH-STREET, PHILADELPHIA
[No. 91, of Vol. lII.]
REPORT of th: SECRET ARY of the TREASURY,
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE
PUB L I C
[l'ONCHinÂ£D,j
A N obvious basis of tlrs eitabhfbnient, which may be iinrae-
JT\. dujely contemplated, is uie a mount of the imerelt on so
much ot the debt as has been, or thai! he, from tune to time, pur
chased, or pa'd otf, or received in discharge ot any debt or de
mand of the United States, made payable m public fecuntiesâ
over and above the interest of anv n w debt, whicn may be cre
ated, in order to Juch purchase or payment.
The purchafesof the debt already made, have left a sum of in
tereit in the Treasury, which will be encrcnfed by future pur
chasesâcertain funis payable to the United Slates in their own se
curities, will, when received, have a fimilat rtfetfc. And there is
ground to calculate on a saving upon the operations which are in
execution with regard to the foreign debt. The sale of the Wes
tern Lands, when provision (hall be made for it, may be expelled
to produce a material addition to such a fund.
It is therefore submitted, that ir be adopted as a principle, that
all interest which (hall have ceased to be payable, by any of the
mc-ms above fpecified, ihall be set apart and appropriated in the
mod firm and inviolable manner, as a fund tor linking the public
debt, by purchnfeor payment; and that the said fund be placed
under the diieCtion of the offtcers named in the lecood fe&ion of
the aÂ£l making provision for the reduÂ£lion of the public debt, to
be by them applied towards the purchase of the laid debt, until
the annual produce of the said fund Ihall amount to two per cent
of the entire portion of the debt which bears a present interest of
fx per centum, and thenceforth to be applied towaras the re
demotion of that portiÂ«n of the debt, according to the right which
has been reserved to the government.
It will deserve the confederation of the legislature, whether this
fund ought not to be so vested, as to acquire the nature and quality
of a proprietary Uuft, incapable of being diverted, without a vio
lation of the principles and fan&ions of property.
A rapid accumulation of this fund would arise from its own
operation; but it is not doubted, that the progreflive develope
ment of the rtfoutces of the country, and a redu&ion of the rate
of interest, by the progress of public CTedit, already exemolified
in a conliderable degree, will speedily enable the government to
make important additions to it, in various ways. With due at
tention to preserve order and cultivate peace, a strong expe&ation
may be indulged, that a redu&ion of the debt of thepountry will
keep pace with the reasonable hopes of its citizens.
All which is humbly submitted.

The amount of Stock funded ,at the Treasury to 30th Septem
ber, 1791, has been ascertained with accuracy, but at that time
many fubfcriptioiis had been made which have not yet been ad
jured for want of proper poweisof attorney and other document*.
It is therefore probable that on settlement of ail the loans, the
amount will be found foinewhat different from what is now re
presented.
The iums funded at the fe>/eral loan-ofÃccs, it is presumed, are
.'ifcertaincd with accural \ ; but as the loans had not been adjofled
i'i all instances when the returns were made, fomc immaterial
differences wiil piobably hereafter appear.

I. The sums marked [a) in the column of remaining debts are
inserted upon recent official communications.
11. Those marked (b) are founded upon official ftatemenrs some
time since received, and reported to the House of Representatives
on the 9th of January, 1790, adding interest for the subsequent
period.
111. Those marked (c) are founded on informal information,
but such as is deemed fubllantially authentic Sc. accurate. Theefti
mate for Rhode-Island includes a sum not ascertained, which has
been cancelled in conlequence of former laws of the State, enjoin
ing the creditors to bring in their certificates and receive payment
in paper-money, but has been revived by a late law of the State,
diretling the sums paid to be liquidated according to a certain
kale, and deduÂ£led from the original amount.
IV. That maiked (d) is founded on a report of a committee of
the eleventh November, 1791, to the House of Delegates of Vir
ginia, compared with a former return to the Treasury and other
information.
107,648. 63
V. That marked (e) is founded upon a (Vatement of the Comp

VI. That marked [J) is founded 011 a itatement of theTrea
fitrer of Georgiaof the 30th of April, 179 c, compared with other

VII. The sums expressed in round numbers are not meant to
be understood as precilely accurate but as very near the truth.
VIII. The foreign as well as the domellic debt of the States is
included.

IT is curious to iee how much men are gavern*

are susceptible of the ltridteit proof. It is natu
ral to expetf among men of ienfe and proper*
ty a close attention to their intereits, and that
of all men they ihould be the lead liable to be
duped by a kind of faffiionable frenzy. Yet the
rage for banks is an example of this frenzy.
The reasons for setting them up!in various plac

infecfted to be cured by reasoning. Experience
will probably be found the only cure. The men

O S Â«Â§Tiusitl are contracted ani not extended by the
over multiplyingthefe institutions.
Is the incre&fe of banks-likely to be ufeful to
the trade and circulation of the country ? ' Many
are eitabliflfciedâmore are expe<fted. Great er
rors of opinion on this head will end in gre/at
losses of property, as well as confufion public
and private.
A bank.is doubtless ufeful, and alinoft indis
pensably so to a trading nationâFor by such
means a man may make use of his credit as well
as his money. His means of trading are increal
ed in that proportion. He gains a new faculty
and this resource iricreafes internal circulation.
The removing many of the obstacles which Mag
nate the circulation of >the precious metals, is
more ufeful than an iucreafe of* their quantity.
A good bank is so much confided in, that it
may lafely circulate its notes to the ainouut of
two or three times its capital.
One great and principal resource for this fafe
ty and credit is, that all the money in a place
will be lodged in its vaults for fafe keepingâYou
have then all the credit and all the advantage
of credit which there can be. Divide that spe
cie however between several banks, what follows !
It ieems to be underltood that two banks will be
found as goodragain as one. Ihe reverie perhaps
is true. A new bauk produces no new deposits of
specie. . 1 here is not a dollar more money added
to the circulation. A new bank divides the de
posits of specie, and of course diminishes the ad
vantages of ci edit. For it is manifeft that two
banks with finaJl capitals, will do less than one
bank with both capitals. The common demand
for specie may be such as to drain the small ca
pital to the lalt dollar, and in the critical events
which the changes of trade and politics are cun
itantly producing, such a small hank certainly
will be shut up, unlets it contracts its dealings
within fiich limits as to be lafe. Two banks in
one town will do this for fafety, and their mutu
al fears will narrow the circulation within what
one bank could support. Suppose for illuftrati
-011, a single bank in a town where three hundred
thousand dollars is the amount of the ordinary
specie deposit. The bank with a capital of as
much more, is exposed to the least hazard in its
dealings that the nature of things will permit.
It is altogether improbable that the whole specie
be called for at once. And this improbabi
liiy gives to the bank paper its utmofl circulati
on. The place has the whole advantage of its
ci edit as. well as money. Let us fee whether by
e.lablifhing three banks instead of one, the town
has more than the wholeâLet each bank have
three, hundred thousand dollars capital Here
then is three times the former capital, and each
bank has but one third part of the deposits If
each bank goes on lending its bills, the circula
tion will be over-done three foldâof course the
bills will be returned, and each bank confined to
the limits of its part of the circulation. As it
will have only a third of the deposits, it will be
obliged in prudence to confine itfelf still more.
Tho one bank might not be exposed to any great
risk of having the whole specie taken off, each of
the three banks will be exposed to it every day â¢
and can guard against it only by contracting its
dealings in proportion to the risk. It may hap
pen any day that 100,000 dollars specie, the a
mount of deposit in each bank, lhall be demand
ed ; but it would be strange that 300,,000 should
be. The rifle is not divided between the three,
tho the profit is. Each runs the whole risk, and
i aS /- J Â° ne , third . only of the Source against it.
Beiides the ordinary banking risks, each inftitu
non is in danger from the othersâand this arti
ficial danger is perhaps equal to all the others.
Numerous independent banks are besides unfit
for extensive circulation, and as they occupy the
local circulation they neither give accommoda
tion forgreat distances nor permit ittobe given.
It may be said truly that two banks will âff er
double the amount of loans, and that this facili
ty will induce many more persons to borrow
If however the notes when lent out cannot be
Kept out cii culating, they will be returned to the
*1! This will defeat the views
of the bank, by depriving it of the profit arifine
from the use of its credit as a capital. If an e> .
tra sum, that is double the amount of the notes
which one bank with the whole specie of the
place would chose to circulate, fliould be thrown
on the public, and kept circulating in consequence

The following Petition is no-ui biftrs Congress
To the honorable the Senate and Hpufe of Re
pefematives of the United States of America,
in Congress affenibled.
r T < HÂ£ officers of the Maflachufetts line of the
American army, in behaif of ihemi'elves,
and the foldieis of the laid line, who were en
gaged to serve during the late war, beg leave re
fpec r tfully to represent,
That in consequence of; the refolmion of Con
gress, recommending to the several Hates to pro
vide payment for the troops railed in them re
fpeitively for ihcir services, until the expiration
of the year 1780, they received prornifibry notes
fiom the (late of Maflachufetts for the arrears of
pay due to them within thac period. And al
though the time has expired in which the prin
cipal of the said notes became due, they have re
ceived but an ineonfiderable part either of prin
cipal or inierelt, five years ofintereft being now
due 011 a certain description of them.
from the commencement of January, 1781, to I
the termination of the war, their accounts were |
fettled by a counnifljoner appointed from Con
giefs. This commiflioner ifl'ued certificates as
certaining the balances duetothem refpeiftively,
and declaratory of an interest of fix per centum
to be annually paid thereon.
Had it been poflible for them to have received
an attual payment at this important moment,
when they were to re-enter life, under the dif
â¢ advantage of having the habits of their former
occupations impaired by their military pursuits,
then property and connections deranged and
loft, their families involved for a neceflary fup
poit, it would have proved more advantageous
to them than any subsequent relief, perhaps in
the power of government to afford them. Jn
ftead of this, they retired patiently from the
field, pofleffing only the evidences of their claims,
to contend with all the evils incident to their si
tuation ; in a confidence, strengthened Jby the
afiurance of their beloved General, that the time
would come when they ihould " receive ample
and complete justice."
From the imbecility of the Confederation no
funds have been eflablifhed to support the credit
of their certificates 3 and they have been left to
take their value from public opinion : The army
have consequently realized no more from these
evidences of their demands than the value so
(tamped on them by the public voice.
Under the government of the United States
they engaged in the service of America, the re
cords of this government contain the evidence
that they have served with faithfulnefs. And as
the people of America are now happy in a con
stitution, formed with a design, and endowed
with the powers, to " eftabjift justice," the
prayer and the objecft of this petition is, that
Congress will be pleased to consider the nature
and degree of compensation which your petiti
oners have received from their state and from
tl, eU n ion, a,K * la^e uch orc ler thereon as your
wisdom shall direct that the contract between
the country and the army may be faithfully and
honorably performed.
And as in duty bound J,hall ever pray.

much doubt whether Congress can <;i ve that en

that this reft net ion, ,f ,t be intended to prevent
partiality, therefore cannot extend to autborifc
diawbacks, which may be productive qf partial
X??r\"l A u thcir confct l uci Â»: jealousies ;
that if drawbacks be granted at all, they omjht
to be universally extended to every article which
is or can be exported from any of the states, hav
ing in its compofuion a dutiable ingredient â  that
hence fliip?, and other veftfels, 4c. (hould hav e
drawbacks on the fails, cordage, iron, fre.Antit
inay also be said, that as to the duty on fait that
is amply repaid to the merchant by the price an
nexed to his fifh ; the sums laid 6ut in fait and
tifh together, form a capital on which he takes
care to have a fufficieut profit. ThofejnerchantÂ»
employed in this traffic, if allowed a drawback
would have a preference toother merchants,who'
import largely, pay heavy duties, and have B0
other advantage than the usual advanct on their
goods. The exporter of any article, with adraw
back, most have an advantage over bis fallow-ci
tizens who purehafe thro' necessity many dutiable
article*, and are obliged to confuina> them with
out any other benefit than the use of them. 1
mention this, because it has been said (by Mv.
Ames) that having made the men of Marblehead
pay for fait, they have a right to demand themo
ney expended in that fait, on the exportation of
their fifh : for it would be as reasonable for the
man who had eat his fifh, on which his fait was
expended, or who had used any other article for
which he had paid a duty, to claim of Congress
a return of his money expended therein, as the
exporter of fifh ; the only differnce js, that if
both were paid the exact sum so expended by
them, the exporter of fifh would get twice paid ;
the purchaser or consumer of his fifh would pay
him for his fait therein, as if it were substantial
fifli, and the slate for it as mere fait : here then
is a field for partiality,difeontentand complaints,
which the constitution wifely guards against. It
canuot, therefore, be to any purpose to tell us
that a bounty, or allowance as it is now called,
is preferable to a drawback, as there is not so
great room for fraud in the one as the other :
nor can it be of importance to fliew that the filh
ermen have not the profit to which they are en
titled ; that their services in the last wardeferve
rewards, &c. their country fiiared with them the
glory of their gallant behaviour ; butthey alone
received the rewards they aimed atâthe J2OO
/hips they took was a conipenfation for services,
and a reward for those exploits. It is true they
annoyed the enemy ; it is certain their prizes
fowetimes fed, armed and cloathed our irmies ;
but it is not said that they did not receive pay
ment for l'urnifliing those things.
But here we are a/ked, is it not of great conA.
quence to the United States, to employ those bold,
flcilful feainen in our service, that we may enjoy
the commercial ad vantage theygive us in peace,
and their powerful assistance in war ?âTo this
I reply, that it ought firft to be proved that Con
gress has the power and authority to give the-n
the encouragement demanded ; andeveni"Â° n
greis have that power, it ought to be (hewn that
it can be extended to the benefit ot the failo^ so
some of the states, and not to those of every state.
It may be said that Congress may with as muc
propriety give bounties to our hunters in t
vveftern country, to raise up a nursery of fol" er
as a barrier against the Indians, and to pionio.e
the fur trade, as to give drawbacks and bountif
to the fifhermen of the eastern states with
to encourage fillieries, and to raise a n ,!r el 7 0
feainen for their defence against enen'ies v'lo m J
invade our eastern frontiers. Indeed, it e e
be the object in view, we might as well 2 ne 0 ,
ties to sturdy landsmen, to be ill readings a
conftauc training for war.
Indeed, Sir, 1 confefs I am not altogetliei
vinced, that if Congress have this power, 110
to be thus exerted ; because it is note eai
that thole liilieiuien would not be more pi 0
/ro the United States, if they were cultivating the
lands which now lie walle, and raifiug families,
which wouid be of ten times more value than
their fisheries. A n fery of virtuous families,
which will produce ioldiers, sailors, hufoandmen
and statesmen, must be preferable to amcrd mi -
i'ery of sailors, who generally live iingie, and of
ten periih at sea. 1 always look upon the loss of
a crew to an infant republic, as the loss almoit
of a new ilate.
I speak of this question, hdftvever, ns a citizen
of the United States, as a member of this House.
Were I to discuss it as a citizen of Mali'achufetis,
and in their legislature, I ihould fay, as rue ttate
is nearly filled with inhabitants, arid our (if:"' - ,
men iucreafe our Commerce in peace, protect as
in war, and indeed even enrich us by their jiri?-
es, it is our iiuereit t6 encourage them to the
viniolt, and to prevent their going into the ser
vice of other countries. I might therefore, as a
member of f the legislature of that ilate, do all in
my power to procure bounties for ihein, and in
deed for all the failcris belonging to that Hate ;
but I Ihould not think of applying to Congress
for their alfiftancc, not only becaufel doubt their
right to afford it, but because I ihould look up
on it as in fume degree derogatory to the sove
reignty and independence of the ilate. 1 ihould
look upon such an interference of Congress as a
step towards swallowing up the powers of the
state governments, and as confoiidating the dif
ferent states into one government, which the wife
and virtuous in every Hate always protefled a
gainlt as dangerous to their liberties ; the fear
of which consolidation prevented many Â£ood
men from voting for the adoption of the new
government.

they are to flow in all payments from the public for the interest of
the debt, salaries to officer. l -, &c. which will add irrmenfely to the

FOR SALE,
BLOOM SBURY,
THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls ot Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in New-Jcrfey, occupied for many years past by
the fublcriber ; containing upwards of 200 acres of land, besides
a tra6l of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
otf in convenient fields, and in good farming order. Thd other
part, bounded by the laid street on the east, and by the river on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined etfeft of situ
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the most
beautiful and defnable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-fiuiftied brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms t>n each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the outbuildings are 3 new stone
coach-house and ftablrs, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horles, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining thele is a very complete granary,
rat praof, and a stone cow-house, upwards of iÂ®o feet in length,
containing thirty-one paved stalls, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, See. Adjoining the court-yard ot the mansion-house, is a gar.
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich collection ot the
choicefl fruits of almost every kind, and fevcral large aiparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance froin the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well
built, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheese-room,
spring-house, garden, See. a complete stone fmoke-houie, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
ceflary out-building. The ground is properly divided into small
fields, all well watered, highly impioved, and chiefly under the
most approved grass. This square has produced annually, for se
veral years past, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, besides
supporting through the summer season twenty to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper seasons,
with great plenty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frefh water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl ; both ot which
may afford a pieafing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
Convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is and divided
?y good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar ports,
Â»nd rails of chHnut and white cedar. The purchafcr may have

Hook, and affords two raoft agreeable (itudtions for Gcntlemcns'
Seats. There are now on it, two brick houses, with gardens, and
a good colle&ion of fruit trees of the best kinds. The land is'very
fertile, and a great part of it very good meadow ; and from its fili
ation on the river, has the advantage of fifh of different kinds, in
their seasons, particularly of oysters and chicken clams, which tnav
he pickcd in great plenty on the flits before the doors. It is a
delightful, healthy situation, capable of genteel and tasty improve
ments ; and as Perth-Amboy is one of the best sea-ports in the
United Slates, and within 18 miles of the sea, the prospect of its
increasing in value from that circumstance, is by no means lucon
fiderable.
1 heie wil' also be (old, other Lots, within the bounds of the

a mod delightful one of the feipeutine courle of the Raritan river,
for several miles, through a rich traÂ£fc of meadow to the Weft.
The great quantity of {lone neatly drefled, and brick, the remains
of the house lately burned, will be nearly fufficient for a new
building; and a large stone cistern, and well of excellent watrr,
with a very convenient ftableand coach-hpufe, will greatly lelTen
the expence of putting the place in order for the residence of a
Gentleman.â There are tew situation;, so eligible, particularly in
the summer feafotiâwhen the cool sea breezes, 2nd the elevated
(ituatioris, render them places of pleasing retreat, from the confine
