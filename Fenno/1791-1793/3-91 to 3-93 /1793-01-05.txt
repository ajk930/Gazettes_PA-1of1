Reduction of the military esta-
BLISHMENT,
Mr. Steele, agreeably to notice, called
up his motion, which is in the following
words: " Resolved, that a committee be
appointed to prepare and bring in a bill,
to reduce the military establishment of the
United fttates to regiments or corps,
confiding each of non commissioned
officers, privates, and musicians, wtih
such proportion of commissioned officers,
as the Ptefident may think proper to con
tinue in service ; and to repeal so much of
an ast pasTed the sth of March, 1792, in
titled " An ast for making further and
more effe&ual provision for the prote&ion
of the frontiers of the United States,"
as may contravene this intention.
Mr. Steele declared he did not rife to
fay much on this motion. The opinions
of members must be made up from obser
vations on fafls that have come within
their own knowledge, therefore, what
he could advance, he did not suppose,
would change their opinions. The house
is in pofTeffion of the motion, and every
member Hands responsible to his condim
ents, and to his own conscience for the
part he (hall a<9; upon it.
He prefaced some observations on the
nature of governments in the progress of
their administration. Time brings abuses
into mod, and he never was so sanguine,
he said, as to expeÂ£t, that the federal
government would be exempt from them.
But when abuses did creep into the admi
nistration of a government, filencehe con
sidered as criminal, arid a quiet acquie
scence worse ; âa free people, however,
were incapable of feeing them without
remonstrating, and the people of America
pofTeffed enough of the true spirit of free
men, not to fuffer the progress of a rui
nous war system, or to bear the burthen
imposed on them to support expensive pi o
jeÂ£ts of ambition without remonstrating.
The people of the United States are
peaceful, they are attached from educa
tion and habit to' regularity and peace ;
he was sorry, he said, that part of our ad
miuillration did not appear to be guided
by the fame spirit. Chimerical projects
had been set on foot without regard to
the public opinion ; âarmies have been
laifed and maintained without affording
protection to the frontiers, and the ex
pence of this system has judly roufcd the
indignation of our citizens. The motto
of a republic should be ' Economy and
Peace.' With these cardinal qualities, any
nation may be happy, without them no
government can be tolerable. He should
proceed, he said, to enquire how far they
had di&ated the measures of our govern
ment. For this purpose he turned to the
approbations, for the purpose of defraying
the expences of the Indian war. He read
some notes, taken from the existing laws
of appropriation and the estimate present
ed for the ensuing year, from which it
appeared, That
tor 1789, 137,000 dolls, were appropriat
ed for the war dep. & 20,000 for treaties.
90, 181,792 20,000

93> 50,000
Making a total of 3.534,347 : 200
for the support of the system fincc the e
stablishment of this young government.
He invited the house to take notice of
this enormous sum; the public, he said,
had done so already ; and this money had
beau or was to be appropriated without
Saturday, January 5, 1793.
fcarccly enquiiing how foimer appropria
tions had been applied. He hoped the
house would do fopaething to check this
growing evil; if they did not, he {hould
invite, he said, the Secretary at war him
felf, to take a retrofpeft for 20 years in
to the history of the frontier, and enquire
into the expenceof defending it when the
defence was entrusted to each individual
state, and to compare that expence with
what has already been incurred under the
present system. It would be difficult, he
said, to point out andjuftify the causes
of their material difference. There was
no good reafan why so expensive a system
as that now pursued (hould be necessary ;
and if the expences of the war-depart
ment could not be reduced, the country,
he conceived, would not be able to bear
them.
His motion was intended, and his mo
tives in making it, were, to afford effec
tual prote&ion to the frontier, to diminish
the expence at present incurred for that
object, and apply the savings to the re
duction of the public debt. He was firm
ly of opinion that if an economical system
was pursued, the defence of the frontiers
could be effe&ed and a finking fund esta
blished that would begin to operate 4 or
5 years sooner than was at present con
templated by the secretary of the treasury,
and that without any additional tax. He
could not approve of any finking fund
that mull be entirely supported by new
taxesâmuch less of one which was to de
pend solely on loans.
He next turned to the mode of war
fare adopted since the establishment of
the federal government against the Indi
ans. The hidory of the frontier fiom
Braddock's defeat to the present day am
ply proved, til at regular nrmtes are im
proper for that kind of war. If this his
tory had been attended to, and the fate
of that commander had been considered
and placed to its true cause, three milli
ons of dollars and many valuable lives
might have been saved to the United
States. A tegular army is an expensive
machine, and in its operations unwieldy
and tardy, composed of men without the
necessary enterj.rize, constitution and ac
tivicy to combat a savage foe, accustomed
to fatigue and fighting for their all.
He quoted a passage from a communi
cation from the Secretary of war himfelf
to the house, to shew the opinion he en
tertained of the enemy. Their sobriety
aad activity, and our ignorance of the
country and mode of warfare. The house,
he said, had not fufficiently attended to
the inadequatenefs of regular armies in
opposition to such an enemy, as demon
strated by experience, and that pernicious
facility of borrowiug had induced to pass
with too little difficulty appropriation up
on appropriation, to purfne it. If taxes
had been demanded to make these provi
sions perhaps the legislature, he suggest
ed, would have been more cautious how
they proceeded.
He again adverted to the mode of war
fare which regular armies necessitated ;
one expedition can only be effeftcd in one
year, and indeed, it had been found, that
even one could not be accomplished this
year ; but one expedition could afford no
effectual protection to the frontier. Be
sides the motions of a regular army are ea
sily watched and known ; Indians, well
knowing when to expect their enemy,
will collect in full force, and beat us a*
they have done, and will do again, if tbe
fame system is pursued',
He was of opinion, that if such a mea
sure would be admiiTible on principles of
benevolence and policy, that the Indian
war might be formed to the state of Ken
tucky, and completely terminated, for
one half of the sum now about to be ap
propriated to support the present futile
fyllem. He appealed for the justice of the
position to those gentlemen acquainted
with the feelings and habits of the peo
ple of that Hate.
249-
, Uporf the success of his motion he con
ceived the success of the war depended.
Regular- troops could never tight, in the
woods. If the system is not changed the
war will be a seven or ten years war. Ae
tive'and enterprftlng frontier militia alone
were equal to opposing Indians.
In his motion, as offeied, there was,
he said, a blank for the number of regt
ments to remain on foot. He (hould pro
pose, at a proper time, he intimated, to
fill this blank up with two, which would
give M2O privates, regulars, quite
enough, even if the President (hould think
it necessary to garrison all the posts which
have been e(labli(hed for the proteilion of
the frontiers.
He enumerated these poll: as follows :
Fayette, 'Hamilton, Stuben, Knox,
Tammany, Telfair, Harmar, Franklin,
Jefferfon, St. Clair, Marietta, MafTachu
fetts, Matthews and Knoxville.
Abandoning the fyilem of a&ive expe
ditions by regular troops, and giving to
each of these an equal portion of the 2128
men, composing the two regiments, each
post would be protested by 152 privates.
This number would be quite fufficicnt,
and greater than that now defending
some of those pods: But he wifhcd it
left difcietionary with the President to
distribute them.
He dated, that the only objefton of
the secretary at war, even to employing
the militia in this war, was. the expence.
He wished to refute that objefrton, and
went into a reasoning of forae length on
the fubjeft. Regular troops, when inlift
Â£d, must be paid, cloathed, &c. during
the whole time of their inliftrr.ent, (whe
ther in a&ual service or not; the militia,
tho' more expensive while on foot; yet
J>eing oq the spot. executing an expediti-,
en in forty or fifty days, then returning
to their homes, and immediately on their
return being out of pay, would be found
in the end much less expensive as well as
much more effedtual. Five expeditions,
he computed, could be made in each
year by a militia on or near the frontier,
and 30,000 dollars he set down as fuffici
ent to pay the expence of each of these
expeditions.
To give an idea of the expence of regu
lar troops, and to {hew the alarming pro
giefs of expeuce on this score, since the
eftablilhment of the new government, he
gave the following items from appropria
tion laws pad, and reports of estimates of
what will be neceflary for the ensuing
year.

The provision for the last mentioned
department, he conceived, bore a very lu
dicrous appearance. He considered it as
absurd to attempt fighting Indians with
ai tiller y. Not all the artillery of Europe
would avail againll such a foe. He could
not fee that either reason or policy would
warrant an appiopriatiou of upwards of
23,000 dollars in the present fefiion for
the purchase of artillery for such a war.
And added that it seemed strange, that

been fuffici-ent to defend tT>c Frontitrgst
rifons, without calling upon the govern
ment to apptcfirlate in four years the sum
Â°f dollars for this purpose.
He next turned to the pay, fuhfiftence
and cloathing the troops. He premised
on this head) that it was well worth con
sidering, whether those articles kept up
an exa& proportion with the encreafe of
the troops, in the items he fliall give ;
they certainly should, he conceived. If
the proportion of the sums latterly appro
priated according to estimates for these
articles proved greater, there mull be, he
contended, abuse foinewhere, and it cer
tainly is the duty of the House of Repre
sentatives to examine where the blame
lies.

He was at fomelofs to account'for th<
want of proportion in the items al ovt
Hated, compared with the number oi
troops employed,âperhaps more officers
were under pay than the public service re
quired ; these things deserve thorough in
vestigation.
He proceeded to (hew what would be
saved to the United States by a change of
fyllem. He (hewed, by a quotation from
a report of the Secretary of the Treafu .y,.
that it was the opinion of that officer, that
the current service of the enfuintr year
would probably require the whole of the
revenue ; but that he contemplates a va
luable surplus for the tedemption of the
debt (hould a termination be put to the
Indian war. He made some observations
on the importance of redeeming the pub
lic debt, as speedily as possible, and com
plimented the Secretary of the Treasury,
in refpeft to the disposition he had (hewn
on this fubjecl.
He was of opinion, that with peace
and economy the refourcesof the country
would be fufficient to accomplirti its total
redemption in ten years, by purchases and
regular instalment payments.âUnder the
ptefent system of warfare, a beginning
cannot be made without levying a new
tax, and a new tax cannot be'granted, un
til the abuses of the war department are
considered and coiredled.
He proceeded to shew the economical
effect of the reduction he proposed, on
our finances, by comparing the appropri
ation of 92 with the estimate for 93 for
the war department. t

VINDICATION OF MR. JEFFERSON.
T DID not expect, aftar my last paper, that
A the puVic would have been longer wearied,
at least u toe fame term-;, with a continu
*tion of tVv'e i.nve Tiv.es which have lor some
time pad i>eeÂ»i iiftied, through the Gazette of
the United States, from a writer under the
llgnature of Catullus I thought I had placed
the point in controversy between us in such a
I'ght, as inuft compel him to bring it imme
diately to a close. But this wiiter has dif
appointcd my reasonable expectations, in this
rcfpett, by Viewing that he was capable not
only of a maiignant afper/iDn, of the charac
ter In qucftion, but likewise of a (hamelefs
effrontery in the mode of condu&ing the dif
cuflion.*
1 he impartial public will however take in
to view, on each fide the object of this con
troversy. They will mark its commencement,
and its several stages ; the nature of the
charges exhibited and of their support, toge
ther with the present dilemma of the writer.
They will likewise pardon the trouble I shall
give tbem, in ptirfuing him through every
fhift. A ftrift analysis of his performance
may perhaps render some service, otherwise
than by the mere exculpation of the citizen
Jiiiailed. The merits of the aifailant are now
likewise before them, and of which it may
eventually to fix a more precise estimate,
than has heretofore been furniflied.
"Whether it would be prudent tor tlie au
thor of Catullus to give his name to the pub
lic, and take on him elf the credit of those
performances, which bear that signature, he
alone fliould decide. He poflefifes the right to
ad in this refpeft as he pleases, and no person
can deprive him of it. There is a difference
between a suspicion and the confefiion of
guilt, which every culprit may avail himfelf
of. To submit to the judgment of his peers,
after the charge shall bs fairly established a
gainst: him, by evidence he has endeavored to
repel, is all that can be required from even
the molt profligate of men.
Yet if truth had been the sole object in view,
in the immediate point of difcuflion between
us, I was, and (till-am persuaded, I had pla
ced it within the reach of fair and easy at
tainment. And the mode suggested in my
last seemed to be proper, as it might refpeft
either the putative or any other author of
those pieces. Were the public interested in
the charges exhibited against the Secretary of
State, fuppofins they contained in them any
thing culpable ? If they were-uot, why trou
ble theni with what, in that view, must be
deemed the effect of a mere personal animo
sity ? And if they were, will it be honorable
for tlie author, when his farts are denied, his
veracity questioned, and a fair mode of in
vestigation pointed out, to fculk beli'nd a
inafk, and deny himfelf to any one, even the
most humble of his fellow-citizens ? All that
can be deemed necessary for the establishment
of truth is, that some person, in whom the
"public cata confide, should be announced, that
he might accompany the author, whether Mr.
Hamilton, or any other person, to the proper
source, for the purpose of obtaining from it
an authentic copy of the original. Would the
grade or ftationof the character thus notified,
be it what it might, encreafe or diminish the
confidence of the public in the result, provi
ded it were suitable in other refpe&s? and in
the situation of the author, asserting at one
time one thing, and at another yielding it up,
perpetually fh sting his ground and owning
himfelf guilty of palpable inaccuracy, and of
courfeof misrepresentation, might it not ra
ther have been expe&ed, he would have
caught with avidity at the opportunity fur
nifhed, ofeftablifhing what was hi reality the
truth, as the means of prefervitig in some de
gree the appearance of candor with the pub
lie?
And will the author of these piece-; leave
\js in suspense, upon the important concerns
of his veracity and fame, until they (hall have
gained the attention of the character, at whom
they have been principally pointed ? Would
it be proper for the Secretary of State, to lay
bare the files of his department, and publilh a
secret document even in his own defence ?
For although perhaps of but little importance
in the present instance, circumftanccd as
things now are, yet in relation to those rules,
which fhonld he observed in the government
of a public office, might it not fubjeft him to
the imputation urged with such propriety a
gainst the Secretary of the Treasury, in cafe
these publications have proceeded from him ?
Can no other mode then bedevifed that might
tend to relieve him from this painful embar
rassment ? I can suggest none; perhaps his
own ingenuity may be more fertile ; but to
ine it appears probable that unless this deli
cacy with re'"p eel to rank should be dispensed
with, his fituat'on must continue to be an un -
pleasant one. The mind of man is naturally
adlive, and disposed to pursue its objeÂ£>; it
will-form fotne conclusion relative to this at
tack and its author. To the claims of fair
and honorable indulgence it will yield its
prompt and ready assent; but when charges
are exhibited against the character of a ref
pedtable citizen, fadts asserted which are not
supported, and the obvious means of proof
when pointed out shrunk from, upon a mere
point of etiquette, fafhionable as is the age
in which we live, they must recoil with ac
cumulated force upon the assailant. I have I
prefurne, (hewn \n a former paper that upon
any ftateinent yet given, if its true import
only were regarded, there was in reality 110

fiat at>oh*v to the tmbhi, for dep.n ting from the

impropriety in tlio sentiment ascribed to Mr.
Jerterfon. Let it be admitted, for the fake of
argument, that be advised Congress upon the
pi'ofpeft of the failure of punftuaiity, in the
payments, to agree to the transfer of the
debt from the French court, to the Dutch
company ; that he even origiuated the pro
position, and pre Tented it to their view, with
out an alternative, wherein was the impro
priety ? Is a nation inhibited by any principle
of morality, from borrowing money for the
most nete'fary purposes, in cafe there is a
possibility of failing in the repayment, i pre
cisely at the time stipulated ? If this were the
cale, how can the original loans, of the whole
foreign debt from Fiance and Holland, be
juftified ? The profpedt of ultimate reiin
burfement, whilst the ilTue of the contest, and
our independence were at stake, was Ctft>
taiuly more distant and equivocal, than after
that happy event was accomplished, and the
whole resources of one of the most extensive,
fertile and productive countries in thewarld,
under our command. Yet although doubts
may have existed whether, under those cir
cumstances any person would lenq, I believe
no one ever hesitated, whether \Â£ we could,
we would borrow. How can the practice of
our own government in borrowing money
in Holland, from one set of men to pay the
interest becoming due to another at the very
period of this letter be) juftified? In (hort I
take it to be well eftabliihed, that if there be
a moral competency, at the time a propor
tion for a loan is made, for fulfilling the pro
poled stipulations, there cannot be any im
propriety in the measure. The turpitude
consists in riot doing afterwards what we have
it in our power to do. Did Mr. JeiFerfon give
any admonition to his countrymen to this ef
fect ? Did he advise them not to pay the debt,
or to relax in any degree, in their efforts, for
that purpose ?
No. VI.
In fatt, a change of the debt in some shape or
other, either by the negociation of the Ficnch
court, or the Congress," with money-lenderÂ® ii
Holland, seemed to be the neccffary conff quencS
of the relative situation and interelts of the seve
ral parties. Fiance was distressed for monc\.
Neaily exhanfted by a laborious effort, in favor
of our independence, and daily impovrrifhed by
an expensive court and piofligate minister, Ihc
grasped with avidity at every resource, however
trifling, to support her declining credit. Our
debt was becoming due by large instalments.
To indulge us was beyond her power ; to have
claimed it, would have Rained our national cha
raÂ£ler with ingratitude. On the other hand,
we were at itte time unable to pay. Our requi
sitions were li ghtedâour government was fee
ble and without resource. But we poffefled be
yond a doubt, under wife arrangements, the
means of fulfilling more extensive engagements,
and the fagc anddeliberate councils of our couu
try, were rapidly maturing that important
change in our system, which must give us ihe
command of those resources. Holland, there
fore, in this situation, became the object of both
parties. To the exigencies of France she could
yield relief ;to us (he could give time. Was
it not then natural, we should look to th3t quar
ter, for the means of fatisfying our ally, aad *Â£-
lievirig us from embarrassment ?
In the proposition for a new arrangement
with another party, the door would be open
for stipulations in every refpedl more suitable to
us. The reimbursement of the principal, which
was becoming due by great inflaloicnts to
Fiapce, was the true cause which endangered
our punctuality. With the Dutch, this incon
venience might be guarded against. To pro
tra& the repayment to a distant day, has been
heretofore as defuable to them as eligible for
us. And that this was the object conterwplated
by Mr. J< fferfom, no reasonable man can doubt.
In this point of view, his conduct was not only
flriÂ£tly proper, but highly laudable ; and no
thing but the most fallacious ftatemrnt could
throw the smallest (hadow of doubt on it.â
This has been attempted in the instance before
us,by fupprefTing the efTential difference between
the time, at which the old debt was, and that at
which ijie new debt might be made payable;
and bke every other attempt diÂ£lated by the
motives which govern Catullus, must recoil on
the author.
To me it has appeared perftftly immaterial,
which of Â«he expedients was that of Mr Jciftr
fonâfor I can conceive no poflible impiopriety
in either ; nothing but what was warranted by
the moil delicate sentiment of honor, and the
practice of our government, from the declarati
on of independence to the present day. Upon
principle, therefore, I fhonld not have noticed
a difference. I did it lor the fake of tiuth, and
to (hew, that whilfthe wifhtd the accommoda
tion ot his own country, it was in a manner
that migiit do juft.ee, and evince our gratitude
to the Frcnch nanon. I did it likcwife, for the
purpose of (hewing the fallacy of the writer,and
his eagerness to wound that gentleman's fame,
by every plausible mifrepiefentation in his-pow
er. Upon the whole, therefore, I mud consider
thts, as one of the moil illiberal and contempti
ble efforts,to injure the chara&er of a refpc&able
citizen, that has occurred. That the ground
has been in every refpeft the mod trifling and
frivolous that could be. and that nothing but a
great deal ot malice against principles, as well
as the person entertaining them, could have giv
en birth to it ; unless Catullus shall demonfirate
that malice cannot exilt in the fame mind a
gainst both, at the fame time. 1 shall conclude
this paper by observing, how much it is to be
wift'td, this wjiter would exhibit himtrlf 'of
the public view, that we might behold in him a
living monument of ihav immaculate purity, so
which he pretends, and which ought to distin
guish so bold and arrogant a censor of others.
For the GAZETTE oj the UNITED STATES.
Mr. Few no,
WE have fetn in a late paper, under {he
confjiicuous article of Communications,
some general remarks which appear designed
by their author to excite Jufjikion> in the minds
of the people, with regard to their fervapts
acting under the general government. Such
250
vague infintiations are not likely to answer
any valuable purpose, and evidently proceed
from the painful paflion of envy, that rankles
in the mind of him who is grieved at the suc
cess of certain public measures, and the well
earned fame of those who planned them. If
this mighty honest patriot knows of any abufcs
committed by the Servants of the public, why
does he not point them out, ard speak in lan
guage that can be understood ?
Generally speaking, the number of r,formers
for each of the Hates, is about equal to tho r e
who wish to get into places of public trull ;
and in order to effect their purpose, they let
themfe/ves up as the organs of the people. Your
â writer appears to be of this clais, and what
ever his pretensions may be to the contrary,
he has difcoveredhimfelf to be no great friend
the government or to the union, by the
following fentence â" A delegate three or
f )or, or seven or eight hundred miles off, at a
place seldom vilited by an acquaintance,
fcarcelv ever by a rival, ejeupes mut/t of the rc
fptmJUt/ity felt by members oj a local legilla
ture."
From the nature of the.union, and the real
or supposed separate state interests, there is
little real'on to fear that the movements of
the general government will not be carefully
watched ; and it is not probable that the vi
gilance so much recommended, is likely to be
changed into fupinenefs.
We lhall not be displeased if the members
of the legislature of the United States will
watch,one another; and the organization of
the Treafuty Department is known to excel any
thing of the kind in the individual states, with
refpe'ft to guards and checks 011 the conduct
of the persons immediately concerned.
It is believed that the people have much
more to fear from mal-adininiftiation in the
state, than in the national government; but
our hufy politicians are so mnch engaged in
taking care of the latter, that they appear to

These gentlemen are conftnntly finding
fault with the provision made for the public
debt ; notwithftandingevery state had a fund
ing system under the old confederation, that
taken together, cost the people double the ex
pence of the present one. They endeavor to
make us believe they speak the sentiments of
the people ; but the fatt is otherwise, and
there is reason to believe that such men have
no jujl ideas of credit, either public or pri
vate.
The National Bank is also a terrible eye
sore, and is to deftrov every thing ; yet if we
may judge of the opinions of the people from
the aÂ£ts of their legislatures, the business of
banking does not appear unpopular, but di
rettly the contrary ; for almost every state in
the union has authorized such eftabliftiments.
How the public 11 gave away four millions''
that is said to have been made by the bank
subscription, and which it is acknowledged
they ncicr pojj'ejjed, is a matter that requires
explanation. Your's,

IN this place the friends of the French are

Sept. 25th: Nothing could be more beautiful
or better disposed than their works, and every
one who has seen them is astonished that they
were able to form them in such a short space of
time. The batteries rose one above another in
gradation, at the distance of ioo paces from each
other, and they were so strong, that 15,000 men
could not have dislodged the Auftrtans. The

M. Manuel visited Louis XVI. the day before
yeftcrday, and informed him that he was no
longer a King. I notified to him (fays he)
ihe foundation of the republic, land told him,
ihat although he ceased to be a sovereign, he
rrfight ltill be a good citizen. He did not ap
pear to be in the least (hocked at his situation.â
Louis is no more affc&ed with his lot as a pn
foner, than he was as that of a King.
" I spoke to him of our conquests : I told
him of the capture of Spire ; of the surrender of
Chamberry, Nice, &c. and I announced to him
that the fall of Kings was as near at hand as that
of the Laws.
" I also told him, that every precaution should
be taken {or his fafety ; but that he might de
pend upon being treated with all thai humanity
which a tree nat ion ever exhibits towaid&a citi

The votes whkh have been given in the re
spective slates for Vice-President (fays a cor

candidates are represented at extreme points
âthe one a full-blooded anti-federaliii, the
other a reputed arillocrat, at the fame time

We have the pleasure to annoi ce to every

that the firm Patriot and Friend to the true

Tho e who vindicate the federal fide of the
question, take it for a fact that the people are
intelligent and enlightened. Therefore they
offer reasons to the underliandings of the peo
ple, supposing them fully capable of perceiv
ing their force. And this has been constantly
attempted against the current of prejudice
and ignorance, which carries away li.e ieaft
informed part of our citizens in certain dif
trifts of the union. Til:; is treating tie
people refpeftfully, and as experience Las
happily proved, according to their real cha
racter. It is a fact in corroboration of the
remark just made, that the most enlightened
part of the United States, is the liidft federal-
The /action, on the other hand, has treated
the people as if it. wert e.ify to dupe them.
They have made a property of a ftw wolds,
fycli as monarchy, aristocracy, &c. a? d it is
half the employment of their hireling prel's to
ring the changes upon them. Bur we are
happy to lee that these frequent appeals to
the supposed ignorance of the country, are as
ineffectual as they are infultiug.
Whoverfees the conduct of another with
the eyes of an enemy will find matter of
blame. No man will come off clear when his
enemiesaft as his judges. It is on the other
hand no less true } thathe to whom every action
of a man appears wrong, is that man's ene
myâFor as there is some defects in the best
man's character, there is some good in the
worst, and he who condemns all the words
thoughts and actions of the latter, is more>the
foe of the man than of his faults. Apply this
remark to our party fcriblers and the fadtion
that supports them. The government of the
United States has, with them, no bright fpor.
It has done nothing praise-worthy. Â°Its best
arts, or what its admirers call its best, the re
storation of public credit, an adherence to
system an d or der, are termed a curie a
scourge, an oppression. The intention, they
fay too, is worse than the deed.âThe very
change of our affairs from adverse to pros
perous and happy, they pretend, does no cre
dit to government, and that prosperity was
intended and is made the engine of deceiving
and corrupting the people in order tl.e mole
certainly to bind in chains.

small and feeble independent nations oppose
to the diffufion of that principle of the fra

This was the annual Â£aving he proposed.
In hit calculation, he remarked, he ntg
le&ed the bounty held out to the 1600
men yet to be enlitled. A* he was count
ing by tens and hundred* of thousands,
this furn he did not think worth attending
to.
He concluded, that the decision of this
question would speak the sense of the
house in regard to the exilting fylltm,
and whether there was in the government
a fcriousdefirc to obtain permanent peace,
to defend the frontier effc&ually, and to
provide, without refoiting to new taxes
or loans, for the regular and speedy re
dutlion of the public debt.âAn objedl
which seems to be highly desired by the
Secretary of the Trealuty, and all other
disinterested citizens thioughout the
union.
Mi . Hartley declared himfelf againfl:
the object of the motion. He was of o
pinion that at this time, when a treaty of
peace was depending, it would be highly \
dangerous to adopt any step for reducing
our military eftabli(hment. The president
he said, appeared to him to have acted
with the greatest economy in organizing
the forces he was empowered to raise.
He stated the difficulty of raiting troops
in this country, and again infilled on the
impolicy of djlranding those enlisted at
this critiqdl period. A refpeftalsle force
kept up, might produce peace by fpiing,
and in that cafe no ope would regret the
expence of the equipment.
The part of the country from which
the gentleman who made the motion came,
it was true, was not exposed to the incur
sions of the Indians but this was, by no
means the cafe in other paits of the Unit
ed States.
He then adverted to Mr. Steel's argu
ments to prove" regular troops were
unequal to a cdriteft with Indians. There
was no instance in which, he answered, a
body of regular troops had beer, beaten
by an equal number of Indians. The ar
my in the campaign of 1791 was undisci
plined j the only regiment properly dis
ciplined at the time of Geheral St. Clair's
defeat was not in the'engagement ; this
instance therefore of the Indians' success
ihould net, he conceived, be brought in
to view as a proof of the inefficacy of re
gular troops in such a war. It was evi
dent that the troops on the frontiers this
season had afforded very effectual protec
tion to the fiontiers of Pennsylvania and
Virginia.
He dwelt on the impropriety of em
ploying the militia on this service; the dis
tress that the loss of a considerable body
of heads of families in a diftrift would
occailon was too serious an evil to think
light of. Men enliftiug as regulars, on
the other hand, were chiefly adventurers
and tingle men, the loss of whom would
be much less felt.
Mr. Parker rose in favor of the motion.
He adverted to the effects produced by
an encreafe of the (landing forces of this
country; it immediately occasioned a pro
portional inereafe of the armies of our
ealous neighbours to the North and
South'. He mentioned a paper that was
some time since read in the House, a mes
sage or talk from Lord Dorchester to the
Indians; âin it they were told that Prince
Edward, a son of their friend the great
King, had arrived with a chosen band of
warriors to protest them. The Indians,
Jie said, had a higher idea of the military
protedlion of the Biitifh, and would pre
fer it to ours. The Bi itifh were better
acquainted with the effect of military pa
rade on the Indians, and better able with
their veteian ttoops to take advantage of
those feelings. Every effort of outs to
enhance our military reputation, by an
encreafe of forces, would be followed by
a finylar Jlep in the Biitifh colony ; and
we ftiould, in the end, only make war on
our finances. TheÃritifh, he dated, were
better able to afford to make a perpetual
{hew of military : it was more confident
with the fpitit of their political indituti
ons, 'A similar system was not well a
dapted to the sentiments of the people
here, where citizen-soldiers were ready to
turn out for something substantial only.
Before this last war with the Indians,
depredations had no doubt been made by
them on our territory, and by our people
on theirs, but nothing serious had occur
red till the war was begun.
He approved of garrisoning those pods
that could afford (helter to the inhabit
ants of the frontiers in c-ife of attack ;
but did not think regular troops adequate
to any other talk in an Indian war. He
infilled on the opinion, that the militia
alone were equal to undertake an offenfive
war against the Indians.
458,501
Mr. Fitzfimons firft spoke of the im
portance of the question. It strikes at a
total alteration of the fyllera adopted to
preserve peace and protest our frontier
citizens. He was not of opinion that
those citizens on the frontiers were Ibtef
to protest the country. The light which,
would be thrown on the fubjeft il> the
couife of the debate, he expe&ed, would
determine the point. He hoped the
question would be amply di(cuffed ; but
in the mean time he was sorry, he said,
to fee an attempt made to influence the
opinions of metnbers by llatements and
Calculations, which he imagined were by
no means accurate. He mentioned an
instance in which they had been placed in
such a point of view as might make an
improper impreflion. The gentleman
dated that the war had cod the Union
upwards of 3,545,000 dollars.
Mr. Steele said in explanation, that he
had afterted, that sum had already been
appropriated or was called for.
Mr. Fitzfimens said the money appro
priated was not all expended, and that
asked for was dill in the power of the
House to grant or not. He could not
positively fay, at firft view of the gentle
man's calculations, whether they were all
equally erroneous; but this instance, he
conceived, was not much in favor of his
accuracy. Circumstances might very well
account for a difference in the expence of
an army ; troops near Fort Wafhingtpp
could not be provided at the fame rate as
in more populous parts of the dates.â
The depending treaty of peace, he de
clared, raised a great objc&ion in his
mind to the objedt of the motion. If on
consideration, however, it should appear
that the frontiers could be better defended
without regulars, and a valuable saving
made, he should be in favor of the mo
tion. He reminded the gentleman, that
when he quoted the amount of the saving
he proposed, he had forgot to take into
view the expence of the five Kentucky
expeditions. â¢
Mr. Steele said he had mentioned that
these might each cost 30,000 dollars.
Mr. White expressed his dislike to re
gular {landing fotces, and that he wiflied
more use had been made of the militia a
gainil the Indians; yet he was averse to
a reduction, unless a more effe&ual plan
of defence was offered as a substitute to
that now in use.
It was moved to refer the motion to a
committee of the whole.
Mr. Steele expressed his wi(h to fee th<
objeÂ£t of the motion difcniTed in commit
tee. He Â£aid something on the accuracy
of his statements, which had been quef--
tioned, and again mentioned the source
from which they were drawn.
Mr. Williamfon, as a proof of the ef
ficacy of militia in opposition to the In
dians, cited the instance of Major Adair's
refinance to a body greatly superior in
numbers.
Mr. Smith, S. C. declared himfelJCa
gainft the objefl of the resolution. The
President, he said, had the power to dis
band any part of the army, when thei:
service was no longer wanted ; and his
confidence in the President (a feeling
which, from the unanimous.vote of te-e
---le&ion, he had recently recewed, feetned
to be very prevalent) led him to feel well
fatisfied that they would not be kept in
service unnecessarily one moment.
Mr. Dayton next rose. He said he
was in favor of referring the motion to a
committee of the whole House. He
should not, he declared, have risen, if
he had not heard from the two members
from North-Carolina, the ftrangeftj per
version of argument, and the mod ertra
ordinary kind of rcafoning he ever re
membered to have heard. The member
who spoke tirlt, from North-Carolina, de
cried every idea of energy and efficiency
in regular disciplined troops, considering
them not only inefficient, but contempti
ble, when employed agamft Indians, and
to confirm his aflertion had instanced the
expedition and defeat under General St.
Clair, when it was well known that there
were not in fafi two companies of regular
disciplined infantry in the army of that
General. The other member had as ex
252
travag-antly'commended tne mck- u . , ;
and extolled them for, heir effi
ciency and success in Indian warfare, o
which Major Adair, in a late ren <= ount "
with afuperior body of savages, had, he
said, furnirtied an evidence.
In answer to this, Mr. D. was com
pelled to remark, what he fliould olhtr
wile never have done, that the affair al
luded to, made on his mind a very dif
ferent impression, and led to a conclusion
diredlly contrary to that which the gen
tleman had drawn fiom itârhe major,
had unquestionably been surprized, and as
i unquestionably been beaten, and fuffered
the capture of alniolt all his horses
and other property in his camp; but
what he conceived to bellill woi fe,
it appeared that at the commence
nient of the acftion, about half of his
men deserted him,and secured them
selves within the gairifon. Thisin
ftance of the prowess of irregulars
feleÂ»ftcd by the N.C. member lofup
port his arguments would, Mr.Day
ton believed, be found upon enqui
ry to be an unfortunate one.
As he was upon the floor, Mr.
Dayton observed, that he could not
refrain from taking some further
notice of the laboured speech which
the house had just heard from the |
mover of the proposition under con.
(ideration. He should, he said, be
short, for no member could be sup
posed to Le prepared to answer a
speech which certainly no one could
have expe<3ed to have heard within
thele walls ; but as he thought it
probable such another one would
never again be uttered there, he
could not omit a remark or two
upon it. It was admirably calcu
lated, and would seem to have been
designed, to prejudice the people of
the United States against the whole
adminiflration of the government.
It would donbtlefs be recollected
that but a few days ago, this very
gentleman was ftrenuoully contend
ing for propriety, decorum and de
cency in debate, which he complain
ed was not observed by gentlemen
who were opposed to the report of
the committee on the failure of the
western expedition ; liotwithlland
ing this, not content with levelling
the mult unbounded censure againlt
the head of the war department, he
had lavished the molt virulent abule
upon the President of the United
States particularly, and upon a large
majority of both lioilfes of Congrels.
The member had produced a va
riety of arithmetical Itaiements and
calculations, the accuracy and truth
of which not only had been questi
oned, but denied by other members
who had replied to him. One thing
Mr. Dayton said he could not avoid
remarking, which was that that
gentleman had presented as unac
countablc and mysterious, the en
creafed appropriations for the war
department for 91, 92, and 93, as if
it was in any wife ft range, that 2eoo
men should require more ordnance,
hof'pital and quarter-master's stores
than 1000, or that jooo men should
require more than them both. Yet
from flatements of that nature, the
gentleman affected to believe, and
boldly declared that there mult be
the grofl'eft abuses in the adminis
tration. If the annual encreafe of
our expences for protetJling the
frontiers, deserved the censure that
had been To liberally bestowed, it
ought to fall diretftly oil the legis
lature who, Mr. Dayton said, had
directed it by their Jaws, and not
upon the executive who were mere
ly the instrument to carry those
laws into effetft. So much for the
speech, but with refpeifl to the mo
tion which called for a very differ
ent answer, and more mature consi
deration, he should onJy add, that
however he might favor a reduction
of our military establishment, if the
queilion stood upon its own merits
alone, unconnected with some re
cent circumstances, he should think
it his duty to oppose the nteafureat
the present, as it might tend I6ein
barrafs the executive in their ptir
fuits and profpecfts of pacification,
and because he well knew it to be the
teniper of the i ndians, and indeed of
every other people,to rife in their de
mands in the fame proportion that
their treating enemy quieted their fears &
leflened their danger. If our establish
ment was determined to be leflened, It
would be known to the savages before
the treaty, âin confequeuc of which, hÂ«
did not doubt, they would become more
extravagant and insolent in their terms r
and that of course what was now recom
mended as an (Economical saving to the
public, would eventually prove to be pio
fufion in the extreme.
Mr. Wadl'worth expreflld himfelf in a
few words againll the resolution.
Mr. Ames did justice to the gentle
man's industry in the colleiiion of mate
rials in support of his motion. An oppor
tunity, he hoped would be given, to go
over the giound he had f<> ably traversed*
He fa id something of the neceflity of
(lability in the measures of every govern
ment ; on the importance of the question
which the fate of the resolution was to de
cide, and hoped it would meet an ample
difcuflion.
The motion for referring the refutation
to a committee of the whole was agreed
to, and Wednesday was appointed to
take it up. Adjourned.
