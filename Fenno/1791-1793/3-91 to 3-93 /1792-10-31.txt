ON THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.

(concluded.)
IT is the glory of* Columbus that this great
discovery C3ii in no degree be a fen bed to ac
cident. In contemplating the origin of the art':
and faiences, and those firll dilcoveries which
have extended the knowledge, the power, 01
the happine'fs of mankind, we find that most of
them were the result of some fortunate acci
dent, and, as it were, the unsought gift of hea
ven. Few of them were forefeen, and few of
them systematically pnrfued. The discovery of
Columbus was ail his own. It was the etfeft of
rational deduction, the offspring of a profound
and penetrating nlind. But geniqs, like his, is
a flower rare to be seen, and blows, like the
aloe, but once in an hundred years.
Jt is not mv intention to detail the future
tonduft of this great man : his persevering ex
ertions to extend the work he had begunâthe
wifdorn of his eftabli fomentsâhis dignity under
persecution, or the numerous virtues of his
private lifeâin all-, he was himfelfâgreat, ori
ginal and fpbtime ! yet Europe <aw him disho
nored and m chains, and meahjv folfc Â»â );Â»$ a.F'" v
rentine adventurer to bestow his name on the
world discovered bv Columbus.
The beneficial effe&s of the discovery of
America are viable and striking. To trace
and illustrate these would be a grateful task; but
the day, which hastens to its close, and the li
mits assigned me, prohibit a particular detail.
Suffice it, therefore, to observe, that this great
â event enlarged the bounds of human knowledge,
and opened a wider field to the view of the
philosophic mind. Cosmography was impro
ved, navigation advanced, distant voyages ren
dered familiar, and the whole globe laid open
to all the beneficial eife&s of an enterprizhig
commerce. The precious metals which flowed
into Europe from the mines of Peru and Potofi,
gave a new spring to the industry, and melio
rated the manners of mankind. The native
produ&ions of America, oy augmenting the
means of subsistence, have contributed to the
cncreafe of mankind, and has given to Europe
a capacity of twice as many inha
bitants as it could subsist before. To thÂ« sci
ence of medicine it has rendered eifential aid,
and has enriched the materia niedica with the
'OQ.t povccrfuv icbrtfuge in lKttutc ; and la it,
but not least, it has afforded an asylum to the
Â©pp re fled of all nations. America, hidden for
ages, is laid open to view, at the very time,
when liberty, u hunted down intheOld World,"
was panting for the asylum lhe found in the
New. Hither, she retired with our ltern fore
fathersâhere Hie preserved her facrcd firesâ
here she beheld her patriot sons grow bold in
Jier cause, till in the fullnefs of time, she an
nounced herfelf to the world, and eflablifhes
3ier empire forever.
Oh J If amidst the sublime contemplations of
brighter world, the happiness of America can
it'll interest the spirit of Columbus. With
â what elevation of mind must he behold the
growing greatness of this New World. He
iees that virtue and science are the broad foun
dation oh which its prosperity must reft ; and
he rejoices to behold the numerous seminaries
of learning which grace our land, and smiles on
the ilJuftrious chara&ers who patronize and
support them.

Among these we have {he pleasure of feeing

while we recoiled the virtues of those who have

T HE people nt tins country certainly . bad f,.-
great objects in view., which they noped
to attain lhe more eafilyby adopting, the new con
ftitutum. What weie those objcÂ£U ? EftaUlifhii;,;
public credit w s certainly one, and a prmo-.J
one. To fÂ»y notbintr about the juil:ce d.,c 10 in
dividuals and ibe wife policy i.i the long run,
(or a nation to perform us promifea, u is j>laii:
that there is nothing to be got nor fined even a*
I prt sent by the fouJefttricka governmerucoukl p'ay,
Ihort of 4)loilfng out the public debt at once. Foi
good crednt has proved already of more value ihar,
any saving t idt could have been made
By means of it the rate of interest is reduced bo in
at home and abroad.âOne percent, interest fnvtd
is equal to a sixth part of tire pubitc debt forgiven
or released tp the people of the Uiijted Staui.â
Wc pay leiV than five per cent, now ; formerly wt
paid fix or even more. So far then the constitu
tion and the revival of credit have answered ;h
---expeditions of the people when they ratified it.
It hasldLned their burdens at least a sixth.âl h..,
!S ~ot âwc can borrow even at home nr*w at
five per cent. The United States Bank has a&:wlly
fcnt togovcrliment at that rate and a large Cipn ton ;
TX.* is njclui every way* to ru.Â» :â¢
paying off our debt, and to provide for pref nc
and future emergencies. This power to borrow
cafily and on good terms is no light matter, and
will not be thought so by those who remember the
diftrefles of the late war. America had need ol
all its faculties to fufiain it; every nervous cor<.
was drained and overstrained till it had loft its
springâ yet all was want, confufion and difbefs ;
the army had neither bread ncr shirts norfhoe-.â
What would not such a government and such a
state of credit as we now pofltfs have been deemed
worth could wethen have enjoyed them ? Would
not such a weight rhiown into our scale whileuhe
f-alance hung doubtful have been expefled to turn
it in our favor.âMuch of the expences of the war
might have been prevented by an orderly govern
ment telying for fuppbes on readv money. A Na
lional Bank at such a time operating like that of
the United States would have been ineltimableâ
1 hat of North-,America, under tvciy aifadvan
tage was found very beneficial.
Our liberty may be put a second time at rijfk,
and a wife nation, ptirfuing the principle of felf
prefeivation, ought to prepare every means of se
curity. It was the faying of a good Prince that
he chose his fubjedh fliould ke*p their iv
tbeir own pockets, for he would so govern them
according to their affe&ions that he could, com
mand it all when uecrffary for the exigencies of
the nation. Congrcfs by putfuing houeft meafurt s
tor the fuppoit or credit bring every dollar in a
condition to be called for when wauled to fecutt
the liberty and fafety of the counuy.
I his then was the point to be gained : It was
the great immediate interest of the p-ople to gain
it. Theie is nothing fanciful, no round about dif
lant conjÂ« $ure to be made much of in order to
prove what has been afTerted. For want of a good
government and good ciedit, our debt was going
on rvt n in lime of peace, heaping interest on
princi palâtill the interest only amounted to no lefÂ»
than thirteen millions of dollars. Congrcls has
caused the growing interest to be paid legulary,
and already the sum of two millions tour hundred
thouf<*nd dollars of the debt is funk. As our im
ports are increafinp to a tuiprifing degree, there
venue w ill become in a few years equal *0 paying
off immense sums of the debt. It may fafely be
afTerted that no nation in the world is more able
to pay off its debt, or has manifefted a stronger
disposition to do it ; perhaps considering what is
due and how much is actually paid ofF,no natifcn his
made greater progress. When it is considered thai
the government is new and the revenue of very re
cent operation, the people judging from what has
been done have no final 1 cause to confide in the
power and intentions of Cungrefs to free them
from debt.
It is strange Co hear men talk of tlie debt as they
doâas if Congress had made it, for the conven
ience'of having one :as if the fitft duty of Con
gress and the principal expeftauon of the people
weie a trick of State. Neithe' the debt nor the
occasion of it are yet forgotten. Therefore this
suggestion again ft the good intention* of Congress
in providing for it tnny be difregardcd.
When we framed the new government we ex
pelled to fee the trade and manufactures of our
own countiv protedfed and encouraged. The du
ty on imported fabrics has eminently advanced
our manufaÂ£tureÂ« ; so far the expectation of the
people has been realized ; by this means we are
iafer than formerly. In cafe of a war, an army
might be cloathed, and fnrntfhed with gun-pow
der and militar\ ftorrs chiefly from our own work
shops and mills. To those who remember how
I wretchedly we began and indeed carried on the
J war, tnefc considerations w.ill fcem weighty. Our
. trade ana navigation have risen in conlequence of
national protection to a pitch that was never bc
j fore attained.
A small force is kept up to defend the frontiers
a gain it the Indians.âTo provide for the common
defence and pretention is one of the duties which
the people have enjoined upon Congress by the
constitution ; yet this little 31 my, not halt a mntch,
fays experience, tor the Indians, is an overmatch,
lays cowardice or folly, for the freemen of the
country, tfaofe fretmen who laughed at Britiih
and hireling German armies.
Theft- were the duties of the government. Ame
itca had a light to exa&vftom their rulers a per
formance of them. The public expelled, and im
patiently too, to fee them performed. They are
173
'â¢frrnit-d, furcc
Ihc -nut.tiy. On'tne coru>Â«:tv, l
growing' in wealth and people Ufter ever
v/as known at any former period.
Certain perions however write, not very calmly,
gain ft all thele measures, and those who fupport
td them, and those who exccute them.âThey
that they are aiuircpubltcan measures and
founded in ill designs againlt 1 certy. They arc
(old that their arguments conclude aganlk the
coiftittHton, as they accuse Congress of the crime
of doing What the constitution made their fpecifie
duty, ai d what all America cxpefted. They com
plain of this anfweÂ» as severe and not juiT. They
Ly they arc friends.to the constitution, butoppo
fed to the measures alluded to. It will not be ea
sy IroWever, to persuade us that men arc in their
he; rts friendly to the constitution, and yet ene
mi s to ;he measures conforming to it, aud to the
fenie ot America when it was adopted. âBe that
as if may, the people have the happiness to lee
their hopes realized and their condition every day
improving.
FROM THE MARYLAND JOURNAL,
To the PEOPLE of MARYLAND.
A PUBLICATION, in the Maryland Jour
/"V Â«â¢' -. ' Calrwiioi-e Adrei tifei, ofi'dft Tucf
OAy, signed u A Citizen," contains the following
paragraph : 4< We all, as men oj gratitude, are, I
ioubt not, interested in the re-appointment of
:he present worthy Prtfidenti but as men, who
iave a sense of equality and a disgust of iuper
"ilions superiority, are, I am in hopes, linked as
7 st ron g chain againji the Vice-Prefidcnt. âIn fart,
caking such for granted, permit me to recom
mend Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, Esq. as
.meriting the appointment of Vice-Preiident."
To a recommendation so pointed and unex
pe&ed, in Maryland, as that to turn out the Vice-
President, it may not be thought unseasonable to
pffer a few remarks for consideration.
I observe, my fellow-citizens, in the firft place,
that those men in the several states, who have
jeen oppoled to our constitution, have, ever
lince itseflablHhment, incessantly applied them-
Pelves to depreciate the chara&er of Mr. Adams;
hecaufe his abilities and principles were formi-
Jable to their views and ambition ; and because
to prevent his re-eleclion would be a point gain
ed over the constitution i tie If. Little sagacity
is requilite to perceive, that every man ot'abi
lity. who can be turned out of the adminiftrs
tion, or kept out of Congress, adds strength to
their cause and vigour to their hopes; and that
against the most eminent of those their heaviest
batteries have been raised, and their principal
sprung. To piove the justness of thjs
I charge, I appeal to your recollection for the
j mifcelJaneous publications you have read, and
travelling whispers you have heard, calculated
to destroy the well-earned fame of Mr. Adams,
Some of you are a'fo acquainted with what vi
rulence an anti-government faction have treat
ed a Hamilton, whose attachment to the con
i ftitution is unquestionable, and whose virtue and
integrity are equalled only by his great capacity
and extraordinary powers. From the mafter
workman in this craft, down to the meaneU of
his laborers, each in his way, or in his diftriA,
has something to obje<st:, to surmise, to insinu
ate, that may irritate sensibility, and lead to
relignation ; or that, floating on the popular
gale, may infect that general esteem and confi
dence he poiTefTes, which no patriot has ever ac
quired with greater purity of conduct, or held
by a more unexceptionable title. From the
; fame quarter also you fee sometimes to descend,
Upon the Preiident himfelf, a thjn and subtile
mist, which would soon increase to the solidity
of absolute censure, was not the radiance of the
char after too powerful to be o'ofcured, and the
veneration of the people too strong to bear an
open attack with impunity. These circum
stances are notorious; they are to be found in
print; tiiey are in the mouth of ahnoft every
antifederal from New-Hampshire to Georgia ;
they are the ingredients of their incantations,
and the spells by which they would transform
our best patriots into our greatell enemies! â
Tliefe circuinftance*, taken together, prove,
beyond a poflibility of doubt, a systematic and
organized plan to drive from the adminijlration oj
our affair* all those who have rescued us from
anarchy, and restored us to the dignity of men,
and the various advantages of an efficient go
vernment. It will not be said, that known
friends to the constitution and the laws are en
gaged in the combination againit Mr. Adams.
I deny that any such are engaged, and call upon
the opposition to name a (ingle individual of that
description, save, perhaps, a few who know
Mr. Adams through the medium oply of the
milrepre'entations of his enemies j a dejufioa
which, in men of candour, must yield to better
information.
I observe, in the second place, that Mr.
Ad\ms has been as firm and uniform a patriot
as America can boast to Have reared in her bo
som. In the firft years of our revolution, when
the colonies flood alone against Great Britain,
he a&ed a bold and diltinguilhed part in favor
of the liberties of the people. Congress, sensi
ble of his merit as a politician and patriot,
created him Minister to the United Nether
lands. His celebrated memorial to their High
Mightinefles, the large loans of money he pro

oi '.Â»ui "tvhich coH them this cap
ture of St. EtÂ» feat ins and a war with England,
torm a pyramid offer vice l ? far more interesting
to mankind than tliofe built of stone by the
Kings of Egypt. View him next as joint Mi
nister to the court of France, and you fee him
lonfpicuoufly eminent for
and talent*:, especially in negociating and bring
"ig to a clofv the treaty of peace with England,
v/ hich gained from her commiftjoners a greater
extent of territory for the United States, than had
ever entered into the mind of the most sanguine
American to expect. Having finished theft
high trusts, he was appointed Minister to the
court of London, where, finding that he could
not induce them to listen to a commercial trea
ty, on terms of equal privileges, like an honest
citizen, true to the dignity and interests of his
country, he requested of Congress leave to re
turn ; previous to which, he fuggefled mea
iures, since adopted by our government, that
have drawn from England a Minister, to treat
formally here of fubrjefts she would not there
condescend to discuss. The knowledge he ac
quired, in these fevc-ral millions, of the interejls
and views aj the courts of Europe, fit him in a pecu
liar fill, to the grcateft advantage*
the station he now occupies, where these inter
ests arid news, as they refpetl the United States, come
lb often under deliberation. To these fa&s
may be added, that in his letters from England,
and on his return to America, he exprefied not
an equivocal, but decided, approbation of the
constitution of the United States j antl that iij
his writings he is liberal in praise of those ftate
conftitutions formed as ours with checks and
branches, and divisions of power; those real
barriers against encroachments upon liberty*
haftv projects, and dangerous ebullitions of po
pular bodies. Take for example his introduc
tion to Abbt de Mably's observations on the go
vernment and laws of America. <4 If human
wisdom (fays Mr. Adams) can ensure the dura
tion ot'th? only forms of government which are con
fftent with the dignity oj human nature, the Ameri
can constitutions bid fair to be lasting; nor can
any thing, except an exceflive partiality to the
ancients, prevent our discerning their irfnite
Jtiperiority to the boaf.ed republics of Sparta and Rome."
Again, u it is poflible that some few additional
regulations, arising from local arid other acci
dental cirevmftances, might be made with ad
vantage ; but of the exact propriety of these, it
is impofiible for any to judge, who are not im
mediately 011 the spot : And the principles of
these confiitutions are so ot>viouf!y excellent, that every
one who underjlands the nature, and loves the enjoy
ment oj libettâ¢, will acknowledge them to surpass every
tiring the world has hithertofcen."
Such, my fellow-citizens and
are the fenliments of Mr. Adams refpefting.
our governments, where reign superiority of
rightswith personal equality, and diftin<flion of
office without nobility of birth. Where, thtn,
would be American gratitude, were the friends of
order and good government to be " linked as 4
chain againji him,'* whose principles, or political
creed, is no more than the expreflion or picture
of our own constitution ?
I would further remark, that to bring for
ward, at this late hour (unconfulted too) one of
the best and wprthieft of our citizens as his com
petitor, wears rather a doubtful and invidious
afpeft. Is it done, it may be asked, in order to
.deprive Mr. Adams of ten votes, and thereby de
feat hn eUflion; or from a sincere desire to have
Mr. Carroll eledted ? If the latter, u Citizen"
ought to be convinced himjcfjy and be poffeiled of
.fatts to convirce others, that a fufficient number
of ele&ors, in the dijfeient states, will vote to
place Mr. Carroll in the Vice-President's chair;
sot on no other ground could any rational Ma
rylander hazard a vote against Mr. Adams, or
venture to risque losing his eleflion without a
certainty of carrying Mr. Carroll's. But cah
any of you think it likely, or even po/Jible, that
tlae antifederalifts of New-York,
Virginia, &c. would desert, for example, Go
vernor ilimon, their favourite, to give their
votes for so ' iitinguifhed, so decided, so un
shaken and incorruptible a federalift as Mr.
Carroll? To change Mr. Adams for Mr. Car
roll, would neither promote their views nor in
crease their numbers in the Senate ; who then
among you so credulous as to imagine that they
would give a fmgle vote to accomplish it?â
Whoever can believe so, knows little cf their
temper, and still less of their tricks. No, my
feljow-citizens, Mr. Carroll or Mr. Adams suit
not their purposes, and aie not to their taste;
nor will they ever vote for either with a view to
their efeflion. It is a very different character
they mean to carry, and your esteem for Mr.
Carroll is used only as a convenient engine to
withdraw you from Mr. Adams.
To these oblervations I think I may ven'ure
to subjoin* that it is not to disgrace a worthy
and patriotic citizen that will draw Mr. Carroll
into 'he lifts of competition; and to predict,
that if* he ever becomes a candidate for conti
nental favour, his merit and high qualifications
will raise him to a more dignified fiation. But
who can look forward to that moment, when
we shall stand in need of all his merits and aH
our courage; when the United States will be
convulsed to their centre by embrio Caesars,
for empire, and ftarceJy fayed by the
[Whole No. 566'friend* of order and virtue i Who, I fay, can |
anticipate that solemn crisis, of which this is |
only the prelude, without devoutly w.iflring to|
the present beloved Incumbent the years ot the

United States to tlie country weft of the Ohio >
Cede this, and we have peace. Shall it l.c fiid,
that tne oijett of the forces 1 ailed is the pro
teftion of these settlements!â The fa ft is, if
at the trcatv of Fort M'lntofti in the year 1 784,
the coniraitiioners had laid, we relinquith all
claim beyond our former purchase, and are fa
tisfied with the Ohio as a boundary, we (houkl
have had no war.
Tiie contrary was the languageâit was fain,
that territory is ours; we claim it by corn] uc(t;
and you must givp it up, allowing you only a
Small cofner as a hunting ground and fettle
msnt, and a few goods as a bounty, not as a
price.
Surveys and settlements under the United
States of this territory, has.-bee 11 an inforcc
ment of the claim, and has provoked the Indians,
and has engaged them in continual war. The
older fett'emenls have been the victims of this
claim of the public. Shall it then be said, tlut'
it is to protect the western country that the
army is 011 foot ? Let the Congress instantly an-â 
nounce to the Indians a relinquiftiment of claim!
to this territory, and we shall aflc no troops to
protest us: we Ihall have no trouble. !
But the Congress claim it; and have made,
and wilh to make sales; and the frontiers njultj
bear the incursions of the savages provoked
on account of this; they must be harrafled with
militia lervice; taken from the labour ps their
farms at times uhieafonable ; and yet be told
by uninformed peifons abroad, that tliey con
tribute nothing towards the experce of a war,
which is thus brought on them by the publicâ
What i because they do not submit to an excise;
when by submitting to if they would pay more
than teu times their proportion of the revenue.
We have seen the Prelident's proclamation,
which is all right; and he has seen ours, which
is, that we will neither eat nor drink with an ex
cise officer. Let the Preftdent do his duty, and
we will do ours. It is his to enforce ; it is ours
to defeat. We hope to have no difference on
the occasion, but each to carry his point if he
can. We flatter ourselves the power of opi
nion is stronger than the laws; and when a tax
is unequal, unjust, unpopular, opprefTive, in a
free government, it cannot cx.it long, or be
earried into complete effect. Z.

PARIS, August 21.
Mde NARBONNE, the gallant
. and gay Narbonne, has been
taken into cullody :âwe do not hear,
however, that any weighty charge is
laid to his account. When he llio't
the King in danger he halted to his
aid ; he had on a national uniform,
and was found under arms at the
door of the apartment allotted 10 the
King and his family. We rank his
proceedings among the pice fraudes,
more worthy of compassion than ol
condemnation.
The Prince de Poix was reported
to have been in tbe fame predica
ment ; but we find, 011 closer enqni
ry, that he has hitherto escaped tht
Argus eye of the Police.
M. de Biron, in order to encouragt
defeitlon among the enemy's troops,
sent them the translation of the de
cree, which is so well calculated to
allure them to the standard of liber
iy, on account of the Angular advan
tages it holds out to them.âThe de
cree is conveyed into the allied camps
in bottles of Itrong Nantz brandy, a
powerful bait for a northern soldier !
In war, as in love, every wile that
is practicable is fair.

A petitioner came forward and ar
raigned Gen. Arthur Dillon s con.

accomplice, and thought it advisable
to onier his con efpondence to be
seized upon. He was invited to lit
within the bar.
A member read a letter from the

The military commandant of Douay
had handed them a letter, in which
M. A. Dillon renewed his oatli to tlie

exhon'-ng him to do the lame' Ihe
general council, after having heard
the lener read, resolved to (end a co

The Allembly decreed, that the
proceedings of the general council
should be mentioned with dilliniftion
on thcjournals ; and, 011 M. Duhem's

time, that General Arthur Dillon had
lolV all public confidence.
On M. La Source's motion, the fol
lowing decree palled the lioufe :
All Geneiels, General Officers,and
fupei Ceded Officers, whether they be
ftil'pended by die executive power, or
by the legislative body ; Ihall be o
bliged to remain ten leagues from
the army in which they served ; and
cannot go nearer than ten leagues to
any of the other armies, under pain
of being confined during the whole
com fe of the war.
M. Albitte moved, M. Rhnme se
conded, and tlie Aflembly decreed,
that all ftiperfeded officers Ihould be
removed 20 leagues from the fron
tiers ; and that they Ihould inform
ihofe whom it concerned of the place
they had chosen for their reiulence.
Many citizens of the different lec
tions, wished the Aflembly would au
thorize thein to transfer the piiToil
ers of Orleans to Paris. The petiti
oners were admitted within the bar,
and their requelt was referred to the
committee.
The Aflembly decreed, that three
other Commilfioners should be fem to
Luckner's army, in the room of those
who were detained at Sedan. Mefl'rs.
La Porte, Lamarck, and Bi uat, were'
the comiuiflioners appointed.
M. Brifibt brought up a report re
lative to the treaties between Fiance
and the Helvetic Cantons.
In the year 1764, laid M. Briffot,
1 hole Cantons had engaged to fur
nilh 13,784 auxiliaries, the 11 timber is'
now reduced to 10,000 men, t he com
mittee extraordinary' tho't it would
be prudent not to continue the trea
ty. Ihe alliance of the King of
France with tbe Swiss, was nothing
more 01 lefsthan a despotic contrail ;
to break the treaty cannot be injuri
ous to us, while we hrtve a millijji 0 f
frenchmen armed for liberty ; we
(hould therefore not hesitate to de
c!aie, that the Swiss regiments are
no longer in pay. Having thus pre
nnfed, M. Brillot moved, that the le
gislative body iflue the following de

(ldering it neceflary that the* late of
the Swiss regiments should be speedi

JACOBIN CLUB.
August 17.
A member of the federal commit
tee communicated an address to the
society relative to finances. The
committee intended to present it to
ithe National Aflembly.
The address rested on the Follow
ing basis
I. To establish a prcgreflive value
11 the paper currency, from the nioft
considerable to the lowed sum.
2. To lay a duty upon all notes
payable to order.
2. To forbid the circulation of
or lil*er coin ; but to encreafe the
copper and bell metal currency.
4. To work the gold and silver
mines belonging to the nation, in or
der to keep up the balance of trade
with foreign countries.
j. To charge a committee to exa
mine the political Rights of Women
6. To repeal ihe decrees that con
firm, ani guarantee the royal loans
7. Totally to fupprels al! secret ex
pences, a disgrace to a free people,
who ftioold be candid, open, and
Without difgoife.
8. To firpprefs every species of o
peratirtn in finances for the national
Treasury. The address concluded
with an improved afferiion, " that
the trade with the two Indies, and
the potleiTion of the colonies, were
infinitely more detrimental than ufe
ful to the French nation."
A member proposed, that the name
of M. Rosderer (attorney-general-
Syndicofthe department, of Paris)
should be {truck out of the lift of Ja
cobins, for having told '.he Swiss offi
cers, on the ioth of August, to repel
force by force, and fire 011 the peo
ple, it found neceifary.
M. Roederer's name was effaced.
M. Montaut. " The three com
niiflioners sent by the National As
sembly to the central army went to
wards the frontiers. They were re
ceived every where with the molt un
equivocal testimonies of regard, re
fpe<fr and attention. The decrees of
rhe National Allembly wereapproved
of by all the citizens they met in all
the towns tbey went through.
At Meziei'es, however, they were
not received with equally flattering
marks of fatisfacftion. The inhabi
tants wished for the constitution, the
whole constitution, and nothing hut
the constitution. The ioth of Au
gust was represented to them as a
day of crimes, carnage, and murder ;
and the oaths which the commiflion
ers proposed did not appear to them,
as it really was not, agreeable to the
constitution decreed in i 759.
The general council of the depart
ment aflembled that purpose, en
tered into a resolution or putting the
commilfioners under an arrestâthey
confined them in a citadel. â The le
Riflative body decreed, that the mem
bers who had voted for the illegal
measure, should appear at the bar of
the National Afletnbly. Three other
commissioners were deputed to notify
the decree, and to liberate Meflrs

LONDON, August 23.
The Bruflels Gazette contains a
Jong and elaborate contradiction of
all the French accounts, refpetfting
the fkirmiffies on the Flanders fron
tiers, and the dcfertion of the Auilri
au troops, and the mutinies among
them at Motis and Ttsurnay. It de
nies in express terms every aflertion
of General Dillon's letter to the Na
tional Afletnbly ; and affirms that the
desertion has been confined to the
light troops, and is not greater than
nfual.âlt observes that the Auftrians
are not in the habit of giving details
of such petty rencontres asthe French
have lately enlarged upon ; and yet
be it remarked, insert* an article, in
which the Aulhians are stated to
have ktlled abotit 20, and taken ijof
the enemy.
The report ofyefterday, as to French
affairs, was, that a levy had taken
place on Sunday afternoon in Paris,
by which from 40 to 60 thoufaiwl men
were raised for service upon the
frontiers. Such a circumstance, whe
ther a levy was made by force, or
othervrife, could Icarcely have occur
red, except upon the impulse of some
new danger ; and it is indeed be
lieved by these, who have the belt
information, that the French minis
ters had intelligence 011 Sunday morn
ing, which they refufed to communi
cate before measures were taken for
preferring the peace of Paris.
The Duke of Brunfwick is said to
have calhiered fcveral of his officers
for allowing the men under their
c<tmt:ia:id to coinn.it cruelties and
depredations in their march.
The village of Beauville, the in
habitantsaf whichattenipied todefeud

The town of Longwi was spared,
except a few lioufes belonging to

Monday last arrived here the Ihip Niel Mal

the important intelligence they contain is ii
the following abftraft.
I The Duke of Brunfwick, after taking feve
ral fortified places, had marched with his army
'towards Paris,, and was within leventy miles of
that capitalâln conlequence of his fuccefles 01:
the frontiers, Longwi and Several other place,
having fallen into his hands, the National A'
fembly palled a decree exprefiing in strong
terms the danger of the country, and calling on
the citizens to arm and turn out to reinforce
the armyâSix-ty thousand men were to be rais
ed immediatelyâthis decree provided for a ge
neral alarmâthe Tocsin was rung, and tbegc
ncralbeat in allthefeftions. The citizens imme
diately repairbd to the Camp de Mars to feleft
their volunteers, and make their arrangements
to comply with the decree for reinforcing the
army
It being fuggcfted by one of the people, that
previous tÂ« going to the frontiers to fight the
enemy without, it was proper to take care of
the enemy withinâthe idea was immediately
communicated from man to man, and the whole
body immediately divided themielves into par
ties, and spread themselves all over the cityâ
they broke open the pi ilons, and put all thepti
foners to death; among whom were upwards of
one hundjed of the nonjurlng clc.gv, including
one biihop, Cai. Montniorin, fet.&c.âthe con
iution continued at the date oi the lafi Paris ac
count, which was Sept. 3d. âThe garrison of
L'ongwi consisted of 1820 men, who were all
made prifone-s of war.âPart of the Austrian
armv were besieging Verdun. âAn account was
Ipubliflied in an English paper of the 10th Sept.
which was seen at Scarborough, stating that the
citizens of Verdun had demanded of the com
manding officer ihat the city (ho 11 Id be sur
rendered to the Auftrians, that he had been
obliged to comply with this demand, and that
he had in conlequence lhot himlelt. â Ihe

The 16th and 20th Britifii regiments of foot
arrived about the middle of Auguli last at Ja

About a fortnight since, at Christiana, in the
State ofDelaware, five or fix gantlemen being
together in converlation on v public fubjedls and
public characters, âone of the company, a Mi.
M'Kenrton, told a Jlory of the Secretary of the
Trealury, and as he luppofed upon findoubted
authority, nearly in the following words :
44 Colonel Hamilton, said he, applied to Go
vernor Mifflin ; and leprelented the propriety
of reftricling the democratic ascendency in the
national go vernment, which might be effected
by the introduction of aristocrats; adding, that
if he (Governor Mifflin) would co operate in
the formation of this counterpoise, the Secre
tary woujd piedge hirnfelf to get him elected
Vice-President of the United States.
u The Governor declined these overtures,
alledging that he had never discovered to any
one, and should maintain his veferve, whether
he was attached to this or the other principle,
in government; but he knew full well the un
alterable bias of those who fupj>orted him- And,
as to the Vice-PreJidency, he did not hesitate
to declare, that he was more ambitious of re
maining at the head of Pennfvlvania."
A gentleman of the State of Delaware, to
whom this,conversation was communicated, in
order to an investigation of the truth of the
(lory, called upon Governor Mifflin, who in un
equivocal term, declared, that, ,
u No Juch convo fation ever happened, vor could he
recoHeft tiny circumjlunce that could git e birth to Jo ri
diculous a tale."
Printers willing to adminiiter an antidote to
firhilar poisons, will give a place in their yef
pe&ive papers to this sample of the unfounded
rumours continually prÂ«pagated to deltrov the
confidence of their fellow-citizens in public
char after*.

I'art of the French troops winch
lately arrived in the Weft-Indies from
trance, are now landed at St. Kilts ;
being driven away from Martinique,
as Hated in a former paper, they ar
rived at St. Kitts in diltrefs, and asked
sOl \ elief and protection, which were
granted them. Mter refuting
to receive them, the Royalilts
of Martinique sent two frigates to
bring them backâthese frigates ar
lived at St. Kitts and demanded the
troops of the Governor, who did not
think proper to deliver theai upâoh
which the fiigates cut out the empty
tranlports and cauied them off.
We fee nothing in the Kriglifh pa
pers relating to the meeting of the
primary Aflemhlies at Paris 011 thÂ«
261 h Augufl, agreeable to former in
timations.
By a arrived herefrom Mar
seilles, which left that port the 13th
[September, we are informed that 110
iuccounts had been received there of
[the near approach of the Aultrian
army t.i Parisâand it was the opini
[On at Marseilles that the Duke of
Brunfwick would not look at Paris
this winter.
/is yet, 110 irruption lias been made
into fiance, except by the army of
i lie Duke of BrunfwickâThe Prince
of Hohenlobe is kept in awe by the
Monf. Biron, and M. Dumourier
covers the northern frontiers.
COMMUNICATION.
No truth is plainer, and if evert
our anarchy-men could deny ir, none
could preduce more proofs or more
believers, than that without govern
ment there can be no liberty. Weak
ening government, or bringing the
laws into genera] abhorrence, is nia>
nifeftly an attack on the liberty 'of
the peopleâit is levelling the in
trenchments round the very citadel.
Yet onr highfliers use every mean* t<Â»
make the people abhor the laws, tho
confliiuiion, Congress, and the exe
cutive officers. In their eyes, the
vindicating ilie laws and public offi
cers, is a crimeâit proves meflnoefil
of fpirir and corruption of princi
ples. On the contrary, they dub
themselves the friends of the people,
because they labor to destroy all that
rhe people have chosen to efiablitb,
and ir is no fault of their's if oppoil
tioii is not yet made by force of arms
to the execution of the laws eDaded
by the authority of the nation. The
traitors again ft the eonftitutien of
Poland came with arms in their hands,
and the lying pretences of liberty in
their mouths, to overthrow the free
government and laws of their coun
try.

compliments to Kis friends and the public,
tor the many favors he has received, and begs

which lie will warrant superior to any imported,
and which he will dispose of on reasonable terms.
The great number of FoRTt Pianos lately
imported from London and Dublin, induces the
subscriber to caution the public against the art
ful inflations of persons comuiillioned to vend
themâwho, for a very trifling compenlation,
recommend inftrumeuts that are nothing but
the refufe of the European Mufic-Sbops, and
imported at a mere trifle, and fold for the fame
price as a good instrument, to the g eat disap
