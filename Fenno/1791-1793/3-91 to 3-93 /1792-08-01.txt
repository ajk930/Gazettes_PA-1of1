9 f lc of May.
Citizens ! on this day when a deplo
rable and Ihameful eveut, at ihe commence
ment ot 'he war, has severely admoniftied us of
the value of wisdom and rcafon, let us guard against
that ficklenefs ol mmd which has always appeared
so be the ch uicV rillic ot our nation.âThe leaf!
success elevates our hopes, to a degree borderi.v
on soliy :âThe leall repuife plunges us into del
fp.:ir.âBuv. it in the midit of a well-minded grief,
we are willing at last to examine maturely the mis
fortunes which have just befallen us, and firmly
Â»ppl ; y those certain remedies which these misfor
tune tin ms ivrs point out, we shall have no realon
to oe discouraged. Let us only open our eyes
let us icmfniht r iiat fortune and chance arecmpty
founds : âThat success is the rewaid of good con
duit ; that the rcveite is the chastisement due to
imprudence.âSince we have negle&ed thecounfel
of wisdom, let us at lealt profit by the errors or
which lhe had lorewarned us. Lei the pafl cor
reti the â¦uiuie ; and then, not only tne melancho
ly fcencs which we lament, will cease to bean un
lucky omen, but they will rather be a beacon
placed at tne entrance ot a dangerous channel, to
caution us to quit it oS soon as poflible.
Till now. A.i men who saw with terror the re
laxation ot discipline tn our armies, who saw dif
ooedience and n volt reduced to system and become
our rniii.at y code ; the foldlery encouraged to Im
biue in Clubs the molt dcteftable principlesâ or
the rr.oft pernici' o and talle conclusions from true
pi uciples ; 11:(. Generals difgulted 111 a thousand
waysâmful ed, chaled, struck, alldllinated with
impuniry, and always condemned unheard ; âthe
foidiers always excused, juftified without inquiry,
applauded ai.d rewarded when they ought to have
been pumihedâr hose whs have Jeen with terror
such things, who loudly lamented them, and who
wou'd have had us look then fatal consequences
in the face, p fled (if not for traitors} at least for
men governed by old prejudice.-, incapable ot ex
panding theii minds to our new plans of Govern
ment, or of rifmg to the he ighth ol a Revolution',
But on the conrary; thole men, infulced every
day by a crowd Â« i merct naiy wretches, were,and
always will be, friends of their country, friends of
humanity and of the laws ; who infteod ot at
tempting by furious declamations, to flatter the
paflions ot a ; -y and ignorant multitude, employ
the.r ieifure and their r-tle&ion in Audying history
and the nature ot things.
They know that when men arm d and embo
died are not confined within the rules jnd limits
of exact discipline, debauchery, thoughtleirner.s, ,
and a contagious indolence, loon enervate their
minds and their bodies,âThey know that want
of luboi dination in armies, partakes of the essence
of delpolic empires ; in which the foidiers, at
least sometimes, revenge the wrongs of the people,
but aiways do lo by producing evils still greater ;
and that free nations,who have done greater things
than others in war, have obtained their fuperion
ty by the rigid auiteiity of their discipline.â You
may quote as an example of the contrary, those
very enemies agairtil whom we now fight. But
have thole Germans received the military art from
their fathers, or have they borrowed it eliewhere ?
Do their armies resemble thole of the ancien:
northern Hordes, or are they governed by jule.
to thole the Roman armies ?âLet no
one then treat the German or PrufTian discipline
with a deiilion equally itupid and proud ; and let
them .earn to imitate despots in thole things, in
which despots have imitated free people.
Let us then, since it mult be so, cast a glance up
on the horrible and fharoeful event with which
we have stained the commencement of this war.
I do not remark that French joldicrs have fled;
lor the circumstances which followed were such
that one no longer thinks of reproaching them
with their flight. They have alLflinated their
chiefs ; they have mallacied unarmed prisoners.â
Do lucii horrors compote the history ot Jree peo
ple, or that of eafterri tyrannies ? It is in the latter
that armies resemble thole wild bealts which they
tame 111 the fame countries, to prepare them for
the chafe ; but which, when they are in want of
prey, return furious and lhike tin ir keepers with
tenor. '1 is there that Generals are butcher d,
that prisoners are cut to pieces, that prisons and
ftiong caltks are the or*iiy asylums to which Am
balladors and peaceful Urangers can fly for ihel. er,
a gain ft the violence of an enraged populace. Is it
there we would look for example? And are
french tioops becoming Janizaries f
If any thing can yet farther excite the
â¢f evtry truly patriotic heart, it would be the tune
and dilcou.lt* of all thole odious fanatics, of all
thofr vile turbulent demagogu. s that fill tiic clubs,
whom the evil genius ol Ftaiue has railed and fup
portsagair.lt tier.âThcnu have aii our misfortunes
proceeded. There, have I.een 'onu-med
and want ofdifapline. Tnere, has rebellion ben
lawful authorities; hatred to
every virions ttyn ; prnteaion to all mali-faito.*.
They have alrendy out on the tomb of tile
unfortunate DILLON', and the companions of his
tall, atrocious and bafc ; which, for
four yean pafl, are the only expiations which
naÂ»e followed the murder of so many victims la
cuSced by the friends and retainers of these fociev
t ' e j- Dcuht not that the authors of so manV dis

those fa!fe atid ferocious p us, which insult their
country by calling themielves patriotic* will la
bour and lliive, after the firft transports of our
grief fhail bepuft, to intercft us for the fate of sol
diers who could make no oLher use of their arms
than in assassination ; and to tell us, that in truth
it was only an trior, but that the chiefs were aris
tocrats, and that the aimy was fold. It will not
be for want of their efforts, if we do not hear some
buffoon pieparing a Triumph to those cowardly
murderers.
Allyewhofe fouls can feel what is honorable
and good ; all ye who have a country, and who
r.nuw what a country is; who knew what you
laid when you swore to defend it, and with whom
to " live or to die Jrcc" are not words withodt
meaning ; Oh, French citizens, alt ye who have
Sons, Wives, Parents, Brother s* Friends, with
whom and tor whom you wish to conquer ; with
whom or before whom you arerefolvcd to die,
how long {hall we talk of our liberty in order to
remain Haves to impious fa&ions ? Raise then
your voice, shew youi selves, let the nation come
forward, and annihilate all those troops of ideols
who usurp its name ; and w.ho, commanded by
knaves, will destroy us if you <so not all put forth
your hands. This is the only moment that re*
mains, this the pfccile moment in which we are Co
dccide the future. Evil (hall it be to us, it we (hut
the car to the fir it warning that war has given us.
If our condutl 15 courageous and wife; if our re
presentatives display, on this occasion, the grand
charadler of equity, constancy, and vigour, worthy
ol them and of us ; if those regiments of the line
who have acted with French courage, if that bat
talion of spirited National Guards, whom the city
ol Paris shall have eternal honor in having given
birth to ; in a word, it all the warriors who be
haved as good soldiers, as good citizens, as free
men, are commended and rewarded as they merit
âif those who abandoned their General shall be
chafed with ignominy, deprived for ever of the
ufc of arms and ol the rights of citizenship ; âif
the muidercrs of their commander s shall meet con
dign puniffiment ;âif the villains who mafTacred
I unreiiiting prisoners are given up to thfe hostile na
tionâ in Ihort, to let all Europe know that the
French people disavow this right borrowed from
the manners of canibals, and that they have not
recovered their liberty in order to make war like
barbarians ;âif the law invest our Generals with
all the power nece-flary to prelerve in their armies
a Hi iÂ£l difciplin , and punish them for improper
tenderness rather ihan for rigour ; âifjuftice be al
ways attainable, and the immediate confenuence of
the crime ; âit tne intolerable audacity of tht fe
usurping fraternities be reprefFed ; âif the proje&s!
of our Generals, the march of our armies, the pians
of attack,before their execution, cease to be objects
ofdifcuffion in clubsâthe present evil may be easi
ly Â»epaircdâour Generals may recover confidence
and our troops regain their own eftcetn, as well
as that of foreigners. The loft oja pojl is a matter
of uidiftcrence, but the honor of France has been
more brought mqueftionby these detelfable adtions
than it had been for ages part.
II m place of this, our Legislature (hall be indo
lent and weak, where juftjee and firmnefs alone
can lave âs, what officer, having a foul and talents,
would wish to remain in such an army?â What
General wilh to command troops capable of affaf-
Jinating tlie man whom they have previously dis
honored ?âWhere is the citizen that would rot
to makewa, ori an enemy to whom unpu
nilhed massacre would give a right to make retalia
tion, linlefs they choole to conquer us by generosity
and virtue ? And what people would not confidt r
theniltlves just in defpifirig another, which, in be
coming free, lor gets ihe manners of civilized life
and diwefts themfc lvei ul humanity ?
Behold then what every Frenchman ftiould fay
to nimfelf, and fay to his fellow Frenchman, in
repelling with lhameand igoominy all infamous
'"""'l â¢ ho to render a useless example ol
ihis hi ll lelTon of misfortune.
Ye to whom .he withes of your fellow-crizen,
have trnfted the deftly of the empire, it is nme
to lee and to found the pr ctpice toward which
we drive W'th such great ftridc*. You have too
long lillcned to those who call a hatred ot all Cub
ordination patriotism, the impuniiy of all crimes
liberty ; who have futernal feelings for thole a
looe who are banditti or murderers; and who
iek 01 tne reputation of humanity in their pity
v'i'lai ns, wh ch is an insolent derision of all
:;ood men. Rcrollefl that nothing i s more hu

Ivere inflexibility oljuft laws ; nothing more cru

that there is no liberty which is riot held undei

Pain e, in London.
I3eAR To 4 ;f my this comes from the ifiand of
Saints,
Where Nappe i is making a thou land complaints,
'Gainst Law arâi Religion, Vicegerents and Kings,
And Bishops anil Judges, and such odious things ;
And happ) he is not alone to complain,
But in concert to growl with his dear Tommy Paine.
You have heard how Ichalleng'd a Manof the Law,
And efcap'd by a Trick from the Messenger's Paw,
How they took me again, and refufmg all Bail,
Sent your poor Napper Tandy difgraceful to Goal.
But ecod I'll be up with these Great Legifl.itors,
And make them submit to our new made Diftatdrs.
You ' now Who I mean, and how easy the way lick,
The jacobin Club that alembic at Daly's.
Please God ere its long, every Man in the Realm,
Shalt each take in his turn and direÂ£l the State

And your Do&fine no longer be any man's scorn,
For you know, my dear Tciti % 14 We arc equally
born,"
And that he who this moment is ploughing the
land,
Has a right in his turn our Helm to command.
Nor is the day distant when you, Thomas Paine y
Of the Government of England (hall hold the
chief Rein ;
And I, Napper Tandy, (hall joyfully sing,
" I'm greater in Ireland than Viceroy or King"-
So keep up the Ballâand write ilrong as you can,
In favor of France, and her new Rights of Man.
P. S. As I've loft being Sheriff, next Michaelmas

I mean on your fide the water a vifir to pay ;
And my Wife fays (he'll go, her fancy so itches
To fee if (he knows the Combujlible Breechcs ;
Those Breeches, Oh, Tommy, how dismal the tale !
That just in the critical moment (hould fail
Those dear Galligafkinsthat had they been burn'd,
Your whole Constitution must be overturn'd :
tfor your Lords and your Commons would cer-
tainly fall)
And the four Courts of Justice inWeftminfter-Hall.
To the tunc of ca in, the Mob would all Dance,
And England be just such a Country as Francc.
OF Q_U AC K DOCTORS.
AN EXTRACT.
From the Bojlart Independent Chronicle.
' T 75/ itA degree of knowledge can be rea-
V V lonably allowed this kind of" practiti
oners, .vhen fix or eight months are the extent
of time devoted to physical studies. Without
any other kind of knowledge, they turn over
many valuable volumes, written by the ableu
pensâand in the course of their pernfal,acquire
a number oi oid Latin phrases, and hard techni
cal terms, and then dole their books forever.
.Thus stored, in their opinion, with a fund of
uleful knowledge, they commence man-flayers.
Well might such men wear swords by their'ides
to ihow they have a commifTion to kill. Alex
ander was a celebrated warrior, who, through
his martial spirit, fheel rivers of human blood.
j.n like manner, Â£)uack Doctors, through their
ignorance of the force of medicine, and of its
operative effects upon the constitution, are 110
less diftinguiflied for man-flaughter.
" A lingular instance of this vice, arising
from this order of men, took place not long
since in the slate of New-Hampshire. A young
iad is thrown from a horse and wounded. ' The
be ft, as was thought, of the eight or nine doc
tors lefiding in the town, is called. While the
tender youtn, by an exprefiive wilh in his coun
tenance, asks a respite from pain, and relief
from his irioft distressing situation, and nature
w..its. patiently for human aidâthe famous doc
tor arrives. He has the knowledge, as well as
the weeping parents, that something the youth
ailsâBut what it is, and the remed v, are equal
ly unknown to him. As something mail be
don?, he applies . Having given his
learned prescription, he mounts his horse in
great haste, to be gone. The anxious patents
.beg he would tarry a few moments. But to
avoid exposing his ignorance, both of the com
plaint of the youth, and its removal, he answers
" He will do well, I mufl visit another patient''
Thus the youth is left expiring, and made a fa
entice to the gross ignorance of a fa'lfe phy
sician."

Notwithstanding the paci
fic afliirances given by this courc
in respect to the affairs of France,
there is every leafon to mifliuil its
obscure policy. A whole year haÂ»
now been spent in completing the
troops of the line, and belides chefe
the provincial regiments are arming.
These regiments form in the whole
an army of i$ or 16,000 njen, and are
so organized that the whole of tlieni
may be collected in a lew days. The
garrison of Nice is considerably aug
mented. Considering the exhauiled
(late of our treasury, however, there
is reafou to think that all these pre
parations may be fylely meant tor in
ternal defence.
MARSEILLES, April 9.
The true patriots in Marseilles are
a majority of" its inhabitants ; but:
they are timid, and the primary af
feinblies have the affiirance to inti
midate their antagonists who are hoc

a republican and anti-royalist is,with
them, an aristocrat j and this word,

GIRONNE, (Spain) Jan. 12.
ADDRESS TO THE KING OF SPAIN,
Written by a gentleman of Traga, wha
travelled into France with the famous
Count d' Aranda.
Charles ! thy august Father gained
the affections of the Spanish nation by
a government founded 011 modera
tion : his reign was marked with
blefhngs, the memory of which will
never be effaced ; he bridled religi
ous despotism, and mitigated the ho
ly bai bariry of the intjuifhion. We
expecfted of a Prince, whose senti
ments announced philanthropy and
philosophy, that he would perfect
ihefe glorious beginnings : but,
Charles ! thou haft deceived the hopes
of thy people ; thou haft fuffered them
to languish under the iron sceptre of
monachifin, and the pride of Spain
feels the insult. Our allies, the
French, are free, and the report of
their glorious revolution hath struck
thy ears like a peal of thunder, and
made thee tremble on thy throne.
The (late dungeons, which thy au
gufl father had fhu c up, ha*e at thy
command been put to use, and thou
haft spread fear and diftrull; through
out thy wide domains ; the age of
Philip the Second is revived ; bur,
Charles ! listen to the voice of a des
cendant of Cortes, listen to the voice
of Spain entire ; restore to thy peo
ple those rights which God and na
ture bellowed on them, if you desire
not to fee them seize on them by
lorce ; fnut up forever those gloomy
mansions of de/olation, where sacer
dotal vengeance offbis up its human,
lacrifices 10 a God of mercy ; give us
up the liberty to fpeafc and think ;
none but a tyrant can dread the truth,
and surely ihou canst not desire that
so execrable a name should descend
linked with thine to posterity ; con
template the miserable condition of
our lands, bj nature the nioft fertile
in Europe ; tuj fleets bring into our
ports the gold of Mexico and Cufco,
but thy peeple are poor and without
industry ; within these ten years
three great nations have atchievecl
their liberty, and Spain rests llill in
slavery ; we have driven away the
courageous Moors, and fuffered our
selves to bemaitered by the monks
Oh ignominy ! oh shame IâCharles,
thoti art the richest monarch in the
univer/e, be also the 1110 ft glorious,
the must just, the inoft beloved ;
(new tltyfeif worthy of commanding
the Spanish nation, of reigning over
ft eemen ; think on thy true intcreft,
think 011 the energy of the nation,

COMMEKI'EMENT, CAMBRIDGE.
The audience being aflembled in
the afternoon, His Excellency the
Governor was pleased to deliver the
following address :
Mr. President,
THIS Anniversary is calculated to
fill the bosom of Patriots with inex
prellible fatisfavftion, and to expand
the heart with the mod agreeable
sensations. Our virtuous ancedors
have long kept this fedival, under
the fublinie expectation of tranl'mit
ting the principles of religion, and
liberty to their poderity. We, Sir,
with transports enjoy the fruits of
their beneficence.
The love of liberty inherent in the
bread of man, has been regulated,
and refined by the ability acquired at
thisUniverfity. To this we are much
indebted for political conditutions,
â which if exercised with wisdom, can
not fail topref'erve the felicity of our
country
Those of us who are now on the
theatre of public life, exult in the
idea, that tlie walls ot Harvaid,
will, when we are no more, give to
our country in succession, men, who
(hall rake the people by the hand,
and lead them in the path of peace,
liberty, and fafety.
The advantages of this institution
have been acknowledged 111 various
partsof the world. The Universities
of European Nations have paid great
attention te the sons of Harvard ;
and the great, and good men of our
own State have ever considered the
interelV, and honor of the. Govern
ment, as inseparably connetfted
ifiat of this Seminary. They who l
love iheir country's, happinels, w'ill
cherish this lburce of Science. They
who delight in rational liberty, will
here cultivate the plant. And they,
who feel a zeal for true national glo
ry, will make this miiverfity the ob
jetft of their highelt attention.
The genius and learning exhibited
by the young gentlemen, who are
this day to receive the hoiiois of the
Univerfiry, afford us the fulleft aflu
rance of the advantages which the
public will derive from them. Our
bell withes accompany them into the
world. May they be a blefling to
their country. May they continue
to reflect honor upon this Seminary,
and upon your abilities, in the im
portant office which you foftain with
ib much dignity, and reputation.
May yon, Sir, continue to receiyethe
applause of your fellow-citizens :
And may your labors and the labors
of all who are connetted in the im
portant bnfinefs of the University,
continue to meet the public appro-
bation.
The degree of Doiftor of Laws,
was conferred on His Excellency John
Hancock, Esq. His Honor Samuel
Adams, Esq. the Honorable Alexander
Hamilton, Esq. the Honorable Francis
Dana, Efqâand the Hon. John Low

The degree of Doctor of Divinity,
was conferred on the Rev. Ebenezer
Gay, the Rev, Samuel Webster, the

miah Belknap ; and also on the Rev.
John Kemp, and the Rev. Thomas

The degree of Dodtor of Physic,
was conferred on Dr. John Sprague,
Dr. Ammi Ruhamah Cutter, and Dr.
Joihua Brackett.
The Rev. Samuel Lankton, theÃev.
Abiel Holmes, A M. at Yale College;
and the Rev. Samuel Sumner, A. M.
at Dartmouth College, were admit
ted ad eundem.
This day arrived brig Paragon,
Hallet, matter, in J9 days from Cadiz.
âIn lat. 38, long. 64, spoke the (hip
friendfhip, Smith, from Havre-de
Grace, bound to Baltimore.
Schooner Sally, Cobb, in 40 days
from Cadiz.âln lat. 36 : 30. long.
IS : 30- spoke Ship Commerce, from
this port.
By the above arrivals we learn,
that great preparations for war were
making in Spainâa general war in
Europe being Strongly expecfted.â
That the Spaniards would act against
the French.
'Twas reported in Cadiz, that be
tween 14 and 15,000 French troops
were slain in one battle with the
Prufiians and Germans.âThis report
was generally credited ; but when
the battle took place, or where, or
how many of the enemy fell, were
not mentioned. We therefore hope
and trust it will prove fallacious. It
is to be observed, that 110 newspapers,
or any periodical productions of a
political nature, are allowed to be
publiflied in Spain.
By the above arrivals we also have
accounts of the profpevfts of a mod
plentiful harved in Spainâall kinds
of provision were very low in Cadiz,
Flour was felling from five to fix dol
lars per barrel, lndia,n Com at half a
dollar per bufliel, Beef from seven
to eight dollars per barrel.
IC7" Coasters and others will be
pleased to take notice, that the chan
nel from Warren, into the Narragan
fett Bay, is completely flaked out,
by pofls set in the ground for that
purpose, on each fide, being in fever,
feet water, with hands pointing to
wards the channelâvell'els of any
conduction not more than one hun
dred tons, may come up the channel
loaded at low water, there being no
rocks nor sand-bars to intercept the

paflageâAt high water the channel
bath 18 feet water.

ALBANY, July 23
The sales of about eleven hundred
forfeited military lots of land of jo
acres each, were closed on Saturday
last. The average price greatly ex
ceeded every calculation tor iix suc
cessive days ; which is attributed by
some to a redundancy of cash in the
Stateâby others, to an anticipation
of a rapid rife of property in the mi
litary country in consequence of the
profpeifl that the Inland Navigation
will be prosecuted with vigor, which
will tend to shorten thediltance from
that delightful and fertile country to
our market at least one halfâor in
other words, that produce will (when
the canals are compleated) be trans
ported from thence to this city by
water, as cheap as it is now by land
from the German-Flatts. After the
surveying fees are discharged, it is
supposed that there will remain a sur
plus of 3 or 40001. which the Jaw has
expressly appropriated to be laid out
in roads and bridges, within the trail,
which will be a great acquisition to
that infant country, if timely and
judiciously applied.

THE subsequent fliort, tho melan
choly narrative, cannot fail of
exciting the fympaihy of the brave
and good wherever it may be read,
and wherever the fate of the three
amiable youths may be disclosed to
the heart and eye of sensibility.
Robert Sevier and William Sevier
were twin-biothers, " lovely and
pleasant in their lives, and in their
deaths were not divided." They,
with Valentine Sevier, their brother,
were sons of Col. Valentine Sevier,
of North-Carolina.
On the I jth day of January last,
influenced by motives of humanity,
they lent their voluntary aid to Capt.
Rice, whilst endeavouring to stem
the current of Cumberland river,
with all his numerous family, and
the small remains of an humble pro
perty, in order to escape the unre
lenting barbarity of savage foes whose
infiduous plans, while fkulkingin the
woods along the river, were too fuc
cefsful in lopping off from human ex
istence at one fire, and at the fame
instant the above named amiable
twin-youths and fraternal friendi. â
Valentine Sevier, their brother, fell
by the fire of the lavages the nexc
day ; who had gone upon a different
route, to render a service equally hu
mane and generous. Ye men of
fyinpathy, what must be your feel
ings for the keen diflrefsof a father,
in a few hours deprived of three pro
mising sons, not yet arrived to the
prime of manhood, and who promised
to be his stay and fupporc in the de
cline of life. Notwithstanding the
provocation, however, it is hoped the
friends of the deceased will manifelt
such a (hare of magnanimity, as ' ,ot

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES,
Mr. Fenno,
IN your Gazette of last Wednesday, after ob-,
serving that the Editor of the National Ga-|
zette receives a salary from government, I en- j
quired 44 whether this salary is paid him for
tranjlations; or for the deiign of which j
is to vilify those to whom the voice of the peo- j
pie has committed the administration of our
public affairs." In his paper of this day, he in
timates that he u receives a lmall Itipend for
services rendered as French Tranfiator to the
Department of State, and, as Editor oj a free newj
piper." T lis excites my curiosity itili farther,
and I shall hold mylelf obliged to any of your
correspondents, or to the Editor of this really
National Gazette (as it now appears to be) if ei
ther of them will inform me what inducement i
our rulers can have to hire a man to abuse
them, and whether they do not hereby unnecef-j
farily squander the public money. I have often'
heard that authors in England, or their book
sellers for them, when they find tneir books do
net fell according to their wilhes, hire some
garrettecr to write against them ât-ien publilh
a reply to his own lucubrationsâ-and so go on,
objecting and replying, until the attention of
the public is drawn towards the book, and thus
it is brought into demand. If there were as
many pieces in the National Gazette in faror of
government and public characters, as tnere are !
against the n, I ihould be apt to conclude ttiat;
Congress and their oiiicers were playing us the
fame trick, in hopes of keeping their ieats and
places for life ; but when all the publications
are against them, and none in their favorâhen
this u free newspaper" is always
Free to defame, but never free to praise,
it Joes not appear eafv to accountfor tnisbranch
of national expence. If none of your readers
can do it, we must wait with patience 'till the
treasury accounts are publiilied, as ike Confuta
tion of the United States requires, and then,
perhaps, the mystery will be explained.

wit'i remarks.
THERE appeared not long fmce, in the
National Gazette, a lhort elfay, with the
above quoted title. It beginsâ u A perfect
theory on this fuhjedt would be ufeful"âit
would at least be an originalâbut taking it for
granted that such a production is poiiible, we
are favored with the happy effe'fts naturally
to be expected. 44 It would be a monition
agaii\ft empirical experiments by power"â
that is an infallible ltandard of political or
thodoxyâperfecution, for conscience fake,
is a damnable doctrineâbut a perfect theory of
citizenfliip would gradually approximate the or
der of society to the true ltandard ofphilofophical
equality
" k The life of the husbandman is pre-eminent
ly iiiited to the comfort and happinefsof the in
dividual." This is not leaving that order oi
men to judge for themselves ; few will acknow
ledge the polition, and it is fandtioned by the
conduct of a less number.â u Healthy the iirft ot j
bleflings, is an appurtenance of his property and ,
his employmentâVirtue, the health of the foul,
is another part of his patrimony, and no less fa
vored by his situation." Virtue has long since
been considered by some as a fccondary confide ra
tionâLabor is the patrimony of the poor, and
the parent of healthâbut Virtue is an adtive
principleâthe fewer its objects, the less appa
rent its effe<sts; and from thefc alone can we
determine the reality of its existence, or the
degree of its power. But is it a fadt that Vir
tue is favored by the situation of the husband
man ?âlet experience teltify.
Virtue was ne'er confined to dwell,
In eloifters drear or hermit's cellâ
She seeks as her fuprerae delight,
The heart that wiihes to do right;
And iccfrns the vicious mind to own,
In lhady groves, or smoky townâ
For grant that ignorance confines
The farmer's views in narrow lines,
Afford them power, knowledge choice,
And idleness will nurse each viceâ
With all the gaudy scene of things,
Which envy round the village sings.
It is true that the more any description of ci
tizens depend on their own the less
dependent they muftbe of course on othersâbut
do fa&s warrant the afTertion, u that the great
er the proportion of the class of husbandmen to
the whole society, the more free, the more inde
pendent and the more happy mult be the society
itfelf?" This is certainly no farther true, than
that a savage life is capable of rendering man
kind more happy than a civilized ; not that the
life of a hulbandman is savage, but the reason
ing goes to fliew that the farther we are removed
from the variety arising from civilization, the
betterâfor if there is no medium in refpe<st to the
proportion between the farmer and all the other
i clalles, the sooner all others are absorbed in the
I firft, the betterâthis fully accounts for the idea
| which led a gentleman to suggest thefuperior po
! licy*>f transforming our fifhermen into back
\ woodsmen.
In cities pamper'dâwhat a puny race,
Live on their incomesâor immured in shops,
Piod on from year to yearâindustrious Haves,
To fortune, pie afu re, honors,-fame !
While the firm hind, who turns the teaming foil,
With nerve of brass, fnuffs the free air, and
ranges unconfin'd,
The happy landlord of his well-earn'd farmâ
But fayâdoes freedom there exert her force,
That shock eledtricâwhich trills from man to
manâ
And routes all his latent pow'rs to a&ior.â
In Cities she delights to dwellâher impulse
thenceâ
Diffus'dâfoon wakes to life the hardy yeoman
band.
"In appreciating the regular tranches of ma
nufacturing and mechanical industry, fays the
etfay, their tendency mult be compared with the
principles laid down, and their merits graduated
accordingly. Whatever is least favorable to
vigor of body, to the faculties of the mind, or to
the virtnes or the utilities of life, instead of be
ing forced or foftered by public authority, ought
to be seen with regret as long as occupations
more friendly to human happiness lie vacant."
" The several profefljons of more elevated
pretentions, the merchant, the lawyer, the phy
sician, the philosopher, the divine, form a cer
tain proportion of every civilized society, and
readily adjust their numbers to its demands and
its circumstances."
So far as the above quotations appear to have
any precise meaning, it is this, that mechanics
and manufacturers, h projcjjion, a re" an useless
order of menâthat they merit no kind of en
couragement from government, left an excess
in tiieir number should be the consequence, and
some individuals fliould be benefitted by their
industry. Every other order, it seems, will re
gulate itfeifâbut an increale of this, will be
the inevitable consequence of encouraging their
exertions; for though the farmers can make
their own neceflary apparel, yet if you put it in
their power, they will purchase fuperfluities,
and if they have the means, they will enjvy the
[ conveniences and luxuries of life. It is how
ever pretty evident, that the speculation now
uiidor confideratio.i was intended to prejudice
the public opinion against governmental encou
ragement to manufactures. But a comparison
between projtjfion and praftiu may not be impro
per. We are warned against empiricism in po
litics and governmentâand yet the United
States are, it seems, to rife to eminence by
adopting a theoretic fyftfem, not warranted by
reason or experience. The pe-ople of thiscoun
71
try nuit either forego their commercial and ci
vilized chara&er, or be dependant on foreign
countries for tho e articles which a superior
state of civilization,fuch as theUnitedStatesnov.
enjoy, cannot do without. If we are not to be
univerlally tranfmographied into tillers of the
ground, and back-woodsmen, we lhall require
for our comfortable accommodation rathermore
than our families can produce of manufactured
articles- If manufactures are neceflal'y, it ine
vitably follows, that in order to their iuccei'sful
prosecution, they must receive governmental
aidâfor without it, it is demonstrable we can
not Â£and a competition with thole countries
who give their ft veral fabrics the highest sup
port. The touchstone of the whole bull net's of
opposition to manufactures, would be a fimpie
proportion for its opponents to give an exam
ple of their attachment to retirement, by aban
doning all the luxuries of civilized society tor
the delights of a back-woodfman's.life.

a firm system of pacification with the savages,
but a fixed line of honest demeanor towards the
hostile Indians, treating them as we ourselves
