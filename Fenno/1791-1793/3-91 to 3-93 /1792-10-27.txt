To this reaYonfng founded on the moÂ»at fuperi- ;
<irrty of Americans over the greateV part of the
world, we may add the divcrfiy of our habitÂ®.
To nations who have grown grey-uoder bad
fvftems, the very vices of their governments seem
ule is fec6nd nature, is ? proverb.
We may a!mr*ft fay it i* tnc.ii powerrtil than na-
for it controuls it. Ccntarics have paffid
lince-the theories of European governments were
framed. Some opprcitive change ( f .adminiftra
tirrn seems nect Haty to change the obedient habits
of nations. Is rhe cafe of AmWica similar? If
â¢we bav'c fixed 'habits,tbev arf'the habit4of change.
We have fcarccly grow n co-id in any of-onr fnftt
tutions. Our governments smell even vet ot the
hands that made them, of the yeast of tnat fadion
"which leavened the m-afs.
On these topics mu<b might l>e said. Butwith
cut dilating on them, much will be thought.
The intention of these remarks, is to convince
tht*friends of the conilitution that they repose in
a state of lalfe security. rely on a principle
which is only partially true in oOr country. It
is time for them to roufeand to oppose the wicked
arts of the enemies of the constitution with

True tfeniiis ft a ray of divinity, Which beam
only on the tall and elevated mind.' A capaci
ty for bold and original diTcoverv reTembles th<
"power of creation ; and its polTeiror jl&fcd a
bove the re(t of mankind, approximates to tht
Deity. Such was the celebrated Columbus.â
AecuftorHed from his Voiith to adventurou
voyages he often cast an inqhifitive eye on thÂ«
inimenfe ocean to the wefly which, for ages, hat
been deemed the impalfibie boundary of the ha
jitab'e wor.ld. Ignorance and superstition fpreac
ill their over the unknown abyh, anc
inevitable deftru&ion Teemed to await {;hâ¬

Scattered ravs of knowledge which fairly illir;
ruinated,the close of the 15th century,

lantic, and boldjy the poflibility ol
reaching them. / Acquainted f-eJin'oui" ear lie tl
yean with the improvements in geography anc
lavigaticyi,.. it is difficult, at firft fight, to com
ire end all the greatness of this bold and ori<
rinal idea. To realize its magnitude, let uÂ«
nark how it was received by philosophers and
cings, when CoUimbns, eager to ascertain it?
:ruth, solicited the pati on?.ge of different courts,
in Genoa, his native city, he was treated witli
ill the contempt with which wealthy jgnorance
ieards the suggestions of unpatfoni/.ed geuius.
n the more enlightened colirt of Portu;jal hi"
â¢Mipo'als were pronouncedtd be chimerical ami
ibfurd. In Spain we find him encountering
he prejudices.of falfe fc : ence, and w:dt:ngfive
ong years in fruitlefs attempts to ciigaten the
cho!ai;s and . ecclesiastical cou ifetlors who
domed the court of Ferdinand and Isabella.
3ut the idea was too v'aft for these philosophers
o comprehend ; and it Teemed to require a ge
lius like that of Columbus hinifelf, to addpt a
cheme To bold and uncommon* Moitified and
reappointed, lie retired from court j and that
ge was 111 danper of lollng a diTcovery at once
on.-jrab'e and advantageous. But to the honor
t' jtmile dilcernment be it told,that while eve
y male monarch regarded Columbus as art idle
d venturer, the generous ITabella dared to pa
ronize and support him. Inspired with a no
lle enthiiiiafin in his cauTe, while her narrow
ninded husband withheld his aid, Hie offered to

It' there be an object truly sublime in nature,
it is Cohunbus on his voyage to America ! To
nfe the language of antiquity, it is a .fight which
the Gods tftbtnielves might behold with plea-
Air#. Oil this very day, the 26th of September,
1492, he had advanced above 700 leagues weft
wafd of the Canary Ulands. There we behold
hiiÂ» in the midst of the pathlels ocean, with
three small and ill-constructed â¢ efleh, steadily
exploring his way where never mortal had ad
ventured betfbre. Amidst: dangers sew and tin
expend, amioft appearances of nature* to a
mariner the inoft alarming, aqdifurrounded by
the terrors and fliperllitioii of his fojlowers, we
behold djifp.layinj* the most unihajcen forti
tituug ; now Toothing their fears, now 1 epref
frng their mutiny, and by pati6n.ce and fup&rior
adcfirfefs eftnbliihing that afceridency over their
minds which genius alone can acquire. But in ;
a voyage so Iqng the resources of Columbus were
at length His officers tkemfelves
were in clef pair ; and this wOjitjerful man was
perhaps the o'nTy bnt whose hopfes remained firm
and nnftiaken. Unable to teprefs any longer
the terrors oJfllls crew, he is obliged to promlfe
that if land.does not appear in thrde dayj, lie
will change his com it? and return to Europe.

3 Or. to another ehMge of
mifreprejoitation, viz. my assertion thaÂ£.the pub
lic faith was pledged in the molt foleinn manner
to the original publfc creditorsâarcL was
not this the plain fall ? or havfr mltfeprtfent
ed in the leaf}: I Ent he fays there \\iafra fi&fe
quent plighting of the piiblic faith loathe afHg
1 iees or holders of the certificates,
not be violated.
1. I a&j \Va* p&yihent ever made to the ori
ginal creditors, according to the flighted faith
of the public to tlieirf? -You itiuft Taj^'No! they
neyer received afiy thingbut depreciated paper,
worth fay one of the fym dye t;o them.
2. I alk, were the original creditoij ever
party to the certificates? You muff answer,
No! the certificates 'Wti not tbo't of when
the contrail dzs> made by the firft &iithorrty t>f
the nation with tbepuhfilc feerji
ficates were .fabricated and iinprffed on them
long lijterand without their free consent. When
a certificate was offered to them, it was that, n
t.oZhihg. St36li in. inipofition in ai?y individual,
would be deeded'liy every body imfvdcnt wpf
tictt w-eJJ ias Jhatoclijs tyetitohefs and can yeu
caJl the,4amc thiiig in a nation, an or pine,
lie jujlict tyrf national honor ?. Or can you
liich a forced trick can be deemed either pyr
vient to those creditors, or a dijchaigc of the na
tion, from their promise, or fiith folefrimy
plighted ?
so this fecoud promise or faith plight
ed to the. <*r bearers oi cojFtificate?,
which Awfucarui talks about, ii <u.ch a thinj
ever Really e'xihed, (which 1 deny) it niuft sol*
low that as far as the demands of the fpecitfa-
there must have been (wo promises
oy faiths plighted for the lame debt, and the
fame money, which he thinks can't both be paid,
and I think so too, and of [tourfe one oi them
is to be preferred, and the other iacriftced.
This naturally leads us to consider the origir
nal merits, earnings, and valuable confedera
tions, on which the' two promKes were at lirft
grounded | and to prefer that which appears to
have thp best original foundation, and to rej-ft
the other, the original balis oi which (to fay no
worle) \Vas but a delusive vifior.
To apply all this to the nrefent cafe
r. Tiie promi r e or public faith plighted to the
original creditors, waÂ¥ grounded on their lYioft
acknowledged meiits and earnings, granted tor
fupplie? jprviccs rendered by them to our
country in extreme diftreJsâ-to vvho f e virtue
and efforts we aYe indebted ior all the money
we now enjoy, yea, for the very walls of the
house in which we have fat deliberating whethe.
we would pay them or not.
2. The promise made to tbe.fpeculatots (if
any was made) was grounded on no original
merits, earnings or valuable cons deration paid
or rendered to any body, or so muth as field up
or pretended hy them. They frf>
tlieinfelve^into theobfblete purviev ofapnb'tc
ast, and by rhe most fhameleis fophiltry which
ever insulted the understanding oi a nation, let
up a claim to v. which they never earned,
to hire, when they had not and to re
wards, without any pretenfovs to thÂ£ viraJes
and merits to which they were due.I leave the reader to make bis election which
of these two fafths or promiies he will prefer,
and only stop to declare that I offer these things
in the face of the world, as matters of public
notoriety, and challenge any American, who
has either coufcience of right or feelings of hu
manity, ts deny an iotaofthem, or to differ from j
me in the sentiments of his own heart, if he can.
I fuppole it will be objeÂ£ed to air this, that
the thing is done and cannot be mendedâThis is, in- I
deed, an old plea, and a pretty good clincher for
runaway matches; but 1 don't think it will apply
to the present caleâ t will be said that the fpe
cuiators are in porfeffion, they are strong and
numeroas, and it will be difficult to oust them;
but truth and right are ftror.ger than they. 1
know they have got hold of great sums of our
public money, under the name ofintereft, which
I lujpÂ«).e they will keep; for I don't expert
that refolding will ever make a part of our
fumjm<g jyftem. But the great capital is unpa ; d,
and ilill remains in the bank and in the nation,

King (carcely noticed it ; and as it
was, he did it indirecftly. Besides
those general motives, said M. Con

which regard the capital.âThe citi
tizens of Paris saw the King surround

Ipiracors. The Conltituiion ordered
him to notify imminent hostilities ;

August 21
M. SERVAN, Minister at War,
informed, that the " villain" I.a
Fayette, and all his officers liad de
ferted. The Lieut. Col. of the 43d
regiment gave him this information ;
whieh might have been expected from
this imaginary hero. France, fays
the minister, was purged of this in
fignificanr individual, between (lie
19th and 20th inftanttâHe, without
doubt, wi)] join his cousin, [Bouille]
the gasconading destroyer adieu
then to the houses ofParis.
The minilter added, " that the
Coinmiflioners of the Afi'embly were
at liberty; and the soldiers of the
late general La Fayette, had been
brought to fee his treasonable inten
tions."
M Maran informed the AlTembly,
that the minilter had told him, th3t
La Fayette had endeavored to lead
hit soldiers into an ambuscade, to
have them all butchered ; .bar that
the army, suspicious of Tome design,
had remained faithful to their inter
efb, and firm on tfieir potts. M. Ma
ran, who had heretofore eonfidered
the charges made againtt La Fayette,
by the mob, to be onjuft } said he
now acknowledged his error, and
freely abjured it.
The imprefllon of the letter of the
minister at war was movedâand tlrat
it be sent to the departments bv ex
press.
M. Breard thought the Aibject
ought to undergo a complete inveiti
gation, before any order was taken
on itâtherefore moved, that the
Lieutenant Colonel of the 43d regi
ment should be heard at the bar on
the fubje<ftâAdopted.
M. Saladin moved, That the Prefi
jdent be requelted to write to the ar
my of the N'.rth, to teftify to them,
its approbation of their good
and patriot!fm.â Decreed.
The three last commiflianers of
he Afl'embly, wrote from Rlieims,
under 20th August. They announce
that the administrators of the depart
ment of Ardennes have retrained their
former resolution, and requelt, in
their behalf, the pardon of the nati
on. The commiflioners add, that
the municipality of Rheims, which
had been sent to Sedan, had return
ed i and inform, that the Commons
of Sedan, impelled by the delirium
of aristocracy, had detained them
prisoners seven hours, under pretence
that they were fartious persons.
The other Commiflioneri inform
ed the Aflentbly, that the Northern
army had courajjeoufly refifte<l the
arts made use of to mislead and de
ceive them ; and refufed to take the
oath which their infignificanc gene
ral wiftied to impose on tliem.
M. Montinorin, formerly minister
of Foreign Affairs, appeared at the
barânot with that haughty counte
nance which before had given so
much offence to every freeman ; but
on the contrary, now excited as much
pity, at lie had before iufpired indig
nation. He was interrogated by the
â¢ resident, relative to several tranfac-
Hons of which he was fufperted.
The examination was lengthy, bat
nothing latisfadory to. the Aflembly

that he had hired incendiary writers,

M. la Pone went to the block with
a fortimde and a resolution worthy
of a better and a more jnft eaufr.
He, however, declared hit innoecnce
to the last ; but the written proofs
produced in court, are indelibleteltr

M. la Pone was turned of fifty.
He was drefled in a new suit of fiilt

Tlie King lias borrowed immense

If thing* do not take a different turn

ABSTRACT of EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE.
PARIS,
22. M. Oswald, a member of the Na
tional Aircnibly, after some preliminary remarks,
on the politics of Great-Britain in refpeft to
France, proposed afraternal address tu be fenti
tp the Britiih nation, in whichfha.ll be unfolded
the whole conspiracy of the traitor LpuisXVl.
and all the outrages which provoked the i'acred
iufrirreftion of the ioth Augult. And that the
address be transmitted to all the popular socie
ties of England, Scotland and Irelandâwith i
request to have it re-printed, and circulated
throughout the Britilh Empire.
Thus, said M. Oswald, you will dispel the
arsffocratic clouds that o&fcure the political at
mosphere of Englandyou will raif'e the spirits
of your brethren, the patriots of Britain, Ihack-
led by royal proclamation!;, atid (yranlzed ovgf
by the odious manoeuvres of an Iriquifitorial
Administration ; and then, perhaps, England,
freed from her tyrants, will at length lend you
a vigorous army to eradicate ariftoqracy and
royalty j and, in unison wfthyou, to bring about,
the revolution of Europe ; and, finally, of the,
whole htafriart species.
M. Boifguvon proposed an amendment. He
wished the copy of the proceedings of the Na
tional AlTembly, and many copies of the papers
found in the king's deik, should be added to the
address proposed by M. Oswald,
M. Oiwald's motion, and the amendment,
were unanimouflv carried.
M. Chjtbot wilhed all taxes to be abolished,
the land-tax excepted.
August 14. Ail violences had ceased in
Paris at this date, and the operations of the
newly constituted authorities were daily en
creafing in vigor, diftinetnefs and popularity.
M. D'Afliy the commander of the Swiss guards,
â said to have been killed 011 the 10th, has beer
tried and acquitted, the orders to that corps
j not having been given hv him. M. de la Porte,
Krttendatit of the civil lift was on his trial. P4.
Barnave has been arrested. Alexander Lameth
elcaped. All the King's servants are in future to
be appointed by the commun tv. A cargo of
j statues has arrived at Paris from Chantillv,

tempting to eft-ape to the Auftrians was ftop

through the head with a pistol. The affairs of
' Poland are lettling under the direction of the
Empress of RufTaâThe King has offered to
i abdicate the crownâbut this offer was not at
, cepted. The Porte, contrary to expectation,
j has not e r poufed the canfe of the Poles; but or.
i the contrary has suspended the daily allowance
of Count Potocki, the Polifli Ambaflador, and
I removed his guard of honor.
The plague has again appeared in Constan
tinople, and in the neighboring villages. Four

Ireland was communicated to that body on the

M. Montmorin, late Secretary for foreign af

The National Gazette of lafl Wednesday
fÂ»JÂ« â" It is a melancholy consideration, that
the plan for civilizing being given over, the ex
tirpation of the Indian tribes seems now the
great object in view on the part of the enlight-,
enei citizens of tbeie states."âOn which a cor
refpbndent remarks, that if this is the determi
nation of the enlightened citizens of our country,
what must that of the uncnlighlc'ci part be ?â'lt
;is hardly poflible to conceive of a more general
libel on the character of a nation, than is con
tained in the above extract.'
We are happy in being informed,
that Mr. AnthonyHaswell, whose
Priniing-Office at Rutland, Vermont,
was lately consumed, has already ob
tained a new atfbrtment of Types, &c.
and was to commence bufinefg again
in that town immediately.
A Siage-Coach for paflengers now

The late condudt of Gen. In Fay
ette, lias excited much public atten
tion :âAnd we wait in the moment
ary expectation of receiving a de
claration from him, explaining his
motives therein; and from the known
Patriotism Integrity and love of Li
berty, which have marked his cha
racter, since his firli introduction to
public life, there cannot be a doubt
entertained, that it will give (atif
fadtion to every mind not immove
able fixed by prejudice. As yet we
have only seen his lafl tranfa<ftion
through the dillorted medium of his
inveterate enemies the Jacobines of
Parisâ and common jultice requires
we should wait his defence. As his
conduit heretofore has been not only
wholly irreproachable, byt highly
meritoriousâwe feel a degree of con
fidence, that in the ilTueof the invef
igation, his last proceeding will also
be found not to merit censure.
*' We are now engaged in the bu
siness of elertioneering ; the old ene
mies of the conltitution are as buly
as they were at the time of the Con
vention, to prevent us adoption
It is true their tune is changed, they
now pretend to be friendly to the
const itut ion iilelt, but tepiobate the
measures of rhe government: It oughc
not to be forgotten that the enemies
of ihe doings of Congress under the
conllituiion are geneially the fame
per/out wild oppoled its adoption ;
we have various candidates held up
in our papersâbut 1 have It l ong con
fidence that in addition to thole- who
have been the agents in regenerat
ing the affairs of our country, we
fhail eledt perfonsof firm, federal in
dependent principlesâmen who will
huild up and not lay walte and de-
It roy.
" You will fee by the papers that
the canal in the Diltridt of Maine is
prol'ec citing with fpiric.
" Tiie bridge over Merrimack Ri
ver will be so far couipleated as to
be pafl'able this year ; it is a noble
effort of genius.âThere is a small
iftand in the riverâan arch of 160
feet diameter and 40 feet above rhe
level of high water connects this
island with the Main on oue fide ;
the channel 011 the other fide is wider
âbut (he center arch on this fide it
140 feet diameter. This is one a
ntong the great number of stupen
dous works which owe tlieir origin
to that confidence between mail and
man which has been created, or re-
Itored by the measures of the gene
ral government.
" We hear with pleasure, thac
your men of property are employing
their capitals in extensive underta
kings which will eilentially benefit:
ilie public as well as themselves
The projected canals in Pennsylva
nia ate plans worthy the genius of
that enterpi izing Slate, i molt hearti
ly wifti them success. The people of
the State of New-York have caught
the fame glorious spiritâand will
doubtless exhibit something worthy
of ihemfelves and their rel'ources â
1 am informed that the canal busi
ness is prosecuting with ardor in Come
of the Southern Statesâbut no par
ticulars have reached us of late late ;
they nvuft enjoy many natural ad
vantages to facilitate enterprizes of
this kind.
" A number of our citizens are turning their
attention to the Federal City. Several are
now on a tour to tho Southward, who, I am in
formed, intend to purchase lots. On their re
turn, I may be able to communicate some parti
culars. At present would observe, that in or*
der to make the place deligned for the perma
nent residence a centre of powerful attraftioi:,
the molt generous terms ought to be held out to
those who would become a&ual settlers. There
jnuft be a depot for merchandize, a scene for
trade, mechanics and manufacturesâand there
must also be a fettled country to create a de
mand. How far this is at present the cafe, I
do not know; but certain It is, that the rapid
settlement of any particular spot favorably fj
tuated, may be greatly promoted by liberal and
judicious measures."
Mr. Freneau, in his National Gazette
of Wednesday last, fays, " that the Gazette of
the United States was set up, as has ever been
taken Jor certain, under an anti-republican pa
tronage."
The history of the origin and progress of this
Gazette is too simple a business to detail to the
publicâbut if there is a person in this city, or
in the United States, who has u takenJor cer
tain" from any circumstances that have come
to their knowledge, that the above insinuation
has any foundation in truth, the Editor pledges
himfelf to prove, in a per&nal interview, that
it is totally unfounded.
