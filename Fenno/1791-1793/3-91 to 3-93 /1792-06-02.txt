PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
THr, man who pays refpeft to the opinions of
others, as he will Â»f hp is confeious he is under
their eye, will follow virtue. In like manner
people should keep an eve on government.
It is a kind of moral check which keeps base and
turbulent paflions down. A well informed peo
ple, as every free one should be made, will form
a kind of confctence for government which will
often guide and always awe then* rulers Theft
is a consequence of raising the body of the citizens
bv establishing schools and making the means of
education general that has not been noticed, tho
it deserves confederation. The admimftration of
a country cannot become very piofligale and cor
rupt unless the body of the citizens are in a great
degree degraded by ignorance. An enlightened
public will find means to give authority to their
opinion of men and measures ; bad men in pow
er may despise the clamours of a London or Paris
mob â but the rrfle&ed indignation of a wi(V peo
ple like the blast of heaven will penetrate the
walls of brass that seem to defend them. The
fleady light thrown on villainy will be irre/iftible,
for molt great crimes agamft a public can exist on
iy in darkness. Knowledge evidently tends to
purifv morals ir- private life, why not in public ?
A remarkable proof that it does so, appears from
the great reformation of the private lives of prin
ces in modern times. Modern Europe would
Tiot, tolÂ®ratc the m mfters whose cnormitie? pol
lute the page of ancient history.âProbably the af
fairs of Ame'ica have been managed with as much
purity aÂ» thpÂ»fe of any country whatever ; the fu
â perior knowledge of the people is a principal
cause.âAs t be ete&'ons are free, and Tince the new
government the conduct of rulers having become
more public and intereftin?, we may cxpeft tq
continue :o enjoy the two following advantagesâ
that men of bad private characters will not be
chosen, and that the public eve will keep them
from at JeÂ«ift very flagrant violations of duty. The
newspapers indeed throw out such insinuations a
Â£ainft Congress. But the state of knowledge in
ihe country refutes them. It is not very credible
that men of such known base and corrupt princi
ples as they impute co Congrels should have been
freely eleÂ£led,at leafl not a majority of luch men ;
and if members of Congress were not woife than
men are usually found, it is strange that they should
since have become so shamelessly abandoned as
they are represented.
The intention of these remarks however, is to
evince the advantage of establishing schools, and
â¢providing for the general information of the ci
tizens ; we seem to think we are true sons of li
berty, and that in our day there is fafety. The
danger after v- e leave the stage will be less than it
is at present, if we take ca>e that our childrrn
ih ill be wiser than we ourselves are. It is a mif
fortune that those who have knowledge are fatis
fied with the polTellion or thev are too lew, and
their influence too much refiftfd and fufpefted by
the multitude to give to this firft republican duty
that preponderance which is necelTary to its being
obfrrved. Enough is not thought, nor said, nor
done about providing free schools. The fubjeft
aftords many important points of view which it
would require some labor to prefrnt diftinftly-
The moral, the political uses of learning, how much
it advances human happtnefs and exalts human na-
ture are topics which the benevolent mind de
lights to contemplate. Another class of men
would be more influenced by our shewing that an
ignorant people earn less than those who are well
informedâthat the spirit of enterprise, the inven
tive faculties ol the mind acquire new force and
a&ivitv with the latter, especially as the spirit of
imitation and a lively emulation will be so evident
ly incited. there a man who doubts that the
94 letters are a inoreufeful invention than the dis
covery of a new continent.-^And yet while w<-
push our enquiries to find out the figure and hifto
ryof the earth with a curiofuy 'bat grows mort
ardent while we indulge it, how large a part ol
mankind are yet to rereive the advantages of the
invention of letters ? Learning,like the polar day,
gleams in twiliglil only over a small part of tin
horizon ; while ignorance seems even yet to be
condensing her fogs and to browd like chaos ovei
an iniperfeft world : And even we who enjoy tho
twilight fuffVr the children ol the poor to rema;,
with the film on their Â«ycs, and to grope thei
way through life in the dark. Education removes
'hat film. Men of sense and virtue you who pof
,r s prope.ty or power, begin this work ; establish
schools, make the uiflru&ion of youth
charge and the care of government, and you will
not have lived in vaÂ«n. PHILO.
THOSE equal laws our citizens demand,
]u(lice requites that they should understand ;
From public f.hools, Oiall general knowledgeflow.
For 'tis the people's sacred rightâ to know ;

STORY OF THE EVERLASTING TAPER
AN EXTRACT â FROM THE FORESTERS*
"\TOW I have spoken of madam's taper, per
i_\| haps you will be amused with some accuunt
of it. It is a wax candle of a common size, set in
an old fafhioned iilver candlestick, richly embofled
and gilt, but the ru(l and dud of it are so sacred,
that it is never permitted to be fcourc.i. The tra
dition is, that thiÂ« candlestick formerly belonged
to Sr. Peter, and the candle firft placed in it is fup
pol'ed to have been lighted at the sun, and by a
mysterious kind of uninterruptedJ'ucccJjion> has been
kept burning ever fw'ce. Bv the light of this ta
per, old madam reads her bible and books of de
votion, which always lie on a table by her bedside.
" Some perform of an incredulous turn of mind,
have pretended to call in queftiori this mystery ;
hut ; t is still lie!d sacred by the old ladyÂ» and by
noft of Mr. Bull's own family. There are forne
even among the forefters of the fame opinion ; and
such is the liberality in these families, that no one
is molcfted in the indulgence of any innocent
whim, which does not affed the peace of the fa
milies, nor the inieicft of the partnerftiip. It was
not long after the re-eftab J ithment of harmony be
tween them and Mr. Bui! % that these persons sent
two candles in one lantern, and one in another, to
be this venerable taper, and dipt in the
consecrated waters. Two of them were afluallv
lighted in old Madam Bull's prelence, and to her
great fatisfa&ion. The other was lighted at a ta
per supposed to be derived from the fame original,
but " hid under a bu(hel ,s in one of sister Peg's
out-houfes, it not being permitted to burn public
ly in her family, where the only candles allowed
are ot the manufa&ure of Geneva.

11 There has been long a controversy between
different opirnonills on this fubjett, as between
the in Liliput, about breaking ihe egg ai
the big or little end. But it is eafv enough to ac
commodate the matter by granting that S'.. Pewr's
candle, as well as those from Geneva, were ongi- j
nally lighted at the hun ; that the fame source o!j

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
March 33, 1792.
The proportion refpefling a further ajfumption of thc\
State Debts under eonjiicration.
MR. CLARK, on the further alTumption, ob
served, that he supposed every man had
made up his mind on this fubjeft, and that there
fore a lengthy debate would be precluded. He
fnould vote again ft it-âlf it had not been for
the alTumption, we should not have been saddled
with the excise, and a great number of officers.
He knew of no advantage which had refultec;
from the great encreafe of the debtâit had gone
into the hands of foreignersâand for it we had
got little more than a parcel of gewgaws, tooth
picks, and other baubles. Our lands bad not
been improved, nor had any other advantage
that he knew of resulted from it. The residue
of the state debts was not so great, but that the
states could easily provide for it.
Mr. WilUamfon said he considered the propo
sition as founded on so unequal principles, as it
particularly refpefts North-Carolina, that he
lhoul# find himfelf obliged to fay NO to it.
Mr. Giles said he was entirely principled
against the aiTumption. The measure originat
ed altogether with the Secretary of the Trea
suryâand his report contained all the reasons
which he had heard urged in favor of it. He
then entered into a consideration of the effects
of the funding system generallyâone was, to
draw the public wealth from the remote parti
of the union to the feat of government. Mo
ney, at the time this system was firft in agita
tion, was drawn from the bank, to accommodate
persons who meant to,and did speculate in state
paper in the distant parts of the union, where it
was extremely low. A system therefore which
has had this effect, ought not to be ftrengthenecl
by adding to itthe means offtillfurtherdraimng
the distant statesâthe effect may be a tempora
ry relief to some of the distant states, but will
finally operate greatly to their injury.
The next argument he noticed, was that
drawn from the inconvenience of conflicting sys
tems of finance. He thought the prel'ent debt
of the United States was fully equal to the re
sources of the government, and ought not to be
encreafed; for with that encreafe, an encreafe
of burthens is neceflarily iinpofed.âThe resour
ces of the general government are said to be not
yet unequivocally securedâhe hardly knew what
was meant by this, except it was that the state
governments were not yet fufficiently prostrate.
The mass of debt already on the flioulders
of the United States, he considered as quite fuf
ficient; and to add to it, would be nothing bet
ter than adding to a mass of corruption ; for he
considered the debt in no other light.
VINVELA
The public content, it is faid,will be increas
ed by the measureâhe thought di rcctly the re
verseâhe anticipated great and increasing dif-j
content*.
The justice of the measure is mentionedâ'ie
adverted to the proportions already aflumed on
account of the several states, and (kid it was evi
dent that the most flagrant injustice had been
done, and therefore a further afTumption was
not'ling better than a inanifeft proposition to
perpetuate a fyftein of injustice.
The debt, it is laid, will he purchased by fo
reigner-, if it is not aflumedâhe conceived the
reverse idea was the true one, and experience
fan&ioned his fuopofjtion.
Additional taxes, it is said in the report, will
not be necefTaryâhe thought the report was in
confident with itfelf, as was evident by a sub
sequent remark contained in it. At any rate
he Oiould think himfelf acting an unjuftifiable
part in aifuming a debt when he knew not what
resources were contemplated to pay it.
He was therefore in favor of postponing the|
fubjefr to the time when the sense of the people
could be more fully afcertaincd by a larger re
presentation in that house.
Mr. Smith said, the gentleman lias refered to
the reasons contained in the last report of the
Secretaryâ"vherear, his reasons are more fully
stated in hi; firft report; to which he wifiied
gentlemen would recur. TiiS gentleman from

PHILADELPHIA.
[Whole No. 525. I
New-Jerfcy (Mr. Clark) has observe '. that he
supposes every gentleman has made up his inind,
ind yet he goes on to date his obje6i ins to the
meafare. He hoped the gentleman would not
jbjeft to other persons giving their reasons why
they are iufavor of it, or of anfv/ering his ob
jections. He then noticed Mr.Clark's remarks
efpefting the excise. The excise, Mr. Smith
Paid, was not the result of the aiTuniptiorâit
was firft thought of for the debt of the United
states, and was diverted from this debt, on
account of the impod being taken from the
dates. It has been laid that some of the didant
dates are opposed to a farther affumptior. T r.
answer to this, he said fo:ne of the didant dates
were in favor of itâhe indanced Sonth-Caro
lina, the legislature of which had expressly in
dru&ed their representatives to advocate itâ
He infilled that the reasoning of the Secretary
was conc'ufive, in refpeft to the loss the dates
would incur by reason of the speculations of fo
reigners. The debt is due, and mud be provid
ed for. Foreigners consider this government as
in honed government; and putting confidence
n tW jultice, will purchase the debt.
He further observed, that a great saving
would be made by a further aflumptionâit
would reduce the interest from 7 to about 4k
ier cent.
The debt is ajuft debt, and has as good preten
tions as that already provided forâand therefore
the gentleman is mistaken in faying that a far
ther afiumption would be founded in injulticeââ
lie gentleman fays if the debts are notalfumed,
foreigners will not buy themâthe gentleman
<urely does not mean that the debt (hall never
He paid; but his reasoning goes to that. The
gentleman calls the public debt a mass of cor
ruptionâif the debt is a mass of corruption, it
is better to confine it to as narrow limits as pos
sible.
Having eftablirtied the principle of aflump
tion, it remains that the government Â£hou\l
'â ompleat the fyltem ; otherwise a manifeft in
justice will take plate, by creating a diftinflion
between creditors exaftlv similarly circumstan
ced in the firft place, and whose demands are
.irecifely the fame with thole provided for.
A surplus has been alTumed in some of the
states, in rm'O'onenrc of the as to
the sum already assumed.
These fabfcriptions are in a very awkv/ard
lituation indeed.
He next noticed Mr. Giles's obfervatiorns as
toapoftponement, and his reasoning arising from
i deficiency of funds; there was no di fiici. Tv on
the ftibjetft of funds, said he, when the frontiers
were under consideration, nor when the ge ntle
,nan urged paying off the national debt.
With refpeft to pointing out the amÂ® .Irrt of
the funds necefTarvâthis, he observed, would
be premature, till the amount to be provided
for was known.
Mr. B. Bourne observed, that t'lough it was
fuppoled that objections would be made to the
proposition, it was hardly to be expected that
they would be made by gentlemen from states
whose debts have already been completely as->
fumedâHe then adverted to the lituation of
thole states who had yet a large debt to payâ
and expatiated on the nature of fio'e debts,
and urged the absolute neceflity and juflice of
a further assumption. If, said be, the meafurd
ivas unjust at firft, which does not appear, it is
nw a measure of ftrift justice and found policy
âThe state of Rhode-Island had not had any
thing like justice done to her in the former af
rumptionâHer debt amounts to one fiftietjl of
the whole debt assumed, whereas (he has only a
one hundred and seventieth part provided forâ
the injustice of this partial provision was so flar
";rant, that he hoped it would not be continued
by rejecting the proposition.
Mr. Clark added some further remarksâHÂ«
was for a settlement of the accounts before any
further steps were taken in afluming.
Mr. Baldwin said he had always been opposed
to the allumption, and on that principle Ihould
oppose proceeding any further in the businessâ
He stated certain objections against the general
government's extending their legiilation to ob
jedts which are not contemplated in the organi
zation of the governmentâAn inequality of
burthens is the inevitable consequence, as no
'ecnrity for an honest apportionment of taxes oa
so general a fcale,from the nature of the govern
ment can be expected.
Mr. Baldwins' fpeecri appeared to be def.gned
to impress this idea, that a previous ascertain-
nent of tha bona fide debt of the refpeftive
States lliou'd precede any assumption.
Mr. Smith (3. C.) replied generally to Mr.
Baldwin.
Mr. Mercer. Language has changed, ptftj
lie debt is no longer corfidered as a public blessing,
'jut as a public curseâand this ientiinent per
vades this House ; What is the nature of thÂ«
pre ft: lit proposition ? why it is to assume the
debt of the several Statesâand thus we are to
s;o on afluming as long as any debt; exist in any
of the State".
There never was a larger sluice to overflow
the public with the burthen of an enormous
debt, than that contained in the proposition.
He confidercd it as holding out a temptation to
originate anew, claims which have been alrea
dy funk : A frcond and third finite, said lie, is"
opened i;i th" deferred and irredeemable qualifyci the other part of the debt; and when he eon
fidered that there was no express provision to
prevent the creditors from demanding aninter
eft for the delay of payment; he conlidered that
the foundation of a public debt to all eternity.
He adverted to tiie different expenses of the
leveral Statesâthere wad no companion could
be formed between them ; in Soiith-Ca
Judge has 8-531. a yearâll Virginia )I:1
currency, flc drew in referee- fro'V; -
States which have made exertion? to pay e.i
their debts are now called on to pay thole of
States which made no exertions whatever. He
enlarged on- the conduct of the State of Ma
ryland in particular. He said the measure of the
aflumption was odious in Maryland a> founded
in injustice. The States are by this meafui'e
made pensioners to the general government.
Mr. BarnweJl supported tha proportion for a
further aifiurtptionâand in an animated man
ner descanted on the merits, services and facri
fices of the States which are now so great fuf
ferers by reason of their exertions during the
war.

" on the opening of the

voke youâl confided in your attach

of thinking of the nation, for con
ducing in peace and tranquility, the
important affairs which occasioned
your being convoked. My hopes
have not been deceived ; and after
having (hewn in war, that you are the
lame people whose courage in former
times alternately (hook or fortified
thrones, you now give to your cotein
poraries an example dill more noble,
of the vigorous prudence and union
with which a wife and enlightened
people condu<ft their deliberations,
when the head of the (late- calls for
their advice on important affairs.
This example is so much the more
grand, that you are the only people
â who give it ; that by doing so, you
juftify the confidence which I repos
ed in you ; and by this mutual union,
you fortify the internal peace and
strength of your country, at the fame
time that you augment that consider

has so justly meritted.
" If, as the firft citizen, as lie in

Diet, you have teftified for 'me and
my son ! How much, in his young
breast, must be fortified that regard
for, and confidence in a generous peo
ple, who from his infancy gave him
such proofs of attachment. You have
seen him attending to your inftruifti

duty to which providence may one
day call him. I wished to accustom
him early to bulinefs, and to teach
him to etteem a people whom he is
to govern, to love their laws and re
fpecft their liberty. In exprefiing
your wishes to fee my son soon in
crease the family, and thus give the
necefl'ary ftrengthand security to the
fucceliion to the throne, you have
participated my paternal hopes. Such
a sentiment must afluredly add to my
gratitude, if my heart were not al
ready full.
" You are now to return to your
homes to re fame your occupations in
peace, anfTto (hare with your fellow

In fliort, I am to apply myfelf to all
the cares which iliy duty and my fix

love and the gratitude with which
your attachment so sensibly affetffc my
heart require in a still greater degree.
These duties, which never cease

The King took every precaution
to fecui e an exatft conformity to his

appointment of a secret-committee to
prepare the several branches of busi

any disputes that might arise from
being generally known, by prohibit

the proceedings.
Notwithstanding these precautions

in order to bring home her sheep, to
secure them from the ravages ot wild

called to her favorite dog for allilt
ance. The faithful animal, ever alert
at the calls of his mistress, obeyed
the command, and eagerly leaped off
to secure from deftruiftion the inno

ately engaged with the bear, and
threw him upon the ground âill
â which situation he held him, until
his mistress, with that degree of for

lier sex, came upâwben, grasping
with one hand a leg of the bear, and
with the other, a club, (he made such
application of the latter to his pate,

The prt sent profprrous situation of our colony
makes us fnrgu the misfortunes we experienced
when this ciiy ftiffercd by fire. His Lordship,
rhe Baron de Caronilelet, our new Governor, uses
"very endeavor to encourage commerce, the arts,
.ind agriculture. Indian, tobacco, rice, and cot
lon art ut\hau!lablt foiirces of wealth. To these
3
we lhall soon be ab'e to addâsugar plantations
from this place to Balise. as veil as at Bara
ta R.I a and cn the plantation aux Boeufs. It
is even talked of to tllablifh them in Florida, the
foil ol which is low, warm and moist, and conse
quently very fit for the culture of the sugar cane.
We have already near this city a distillery which
affords us excellent rum : and whoever under
takes to ellablifh others, will receive confiderabie
I encouragement from government.
Our governor is ercÂ£ting fortifications for the
protection of this capital, which is to be surround
ed by a deep ditch. A canal is to unite the Mii-
UHippi with Bayon St. jean. This work will
rendÂ« r the country more healthy by carrying off
the water. We boast ot a new rope
yard which manufactures a confidrrable quantity
of hemp. Pitch, tar, marts, wood for (hip build
ing, See. add also to our wealth.
The boats lately from the Illinois country bring
agreeable intelligence from that quarter. The
lead mines have produced twice as much as the
preceding years. New fak-pus are opened. The
culture of wheat, Indian corn, flax and hemp in
creases. Linen and cotton cloths, cider, beer,
wine, peach brandy, See. are made there. Belter
tanyards are much wanted. An iron mine is a
! bout to be worked.
The Baron de Carondelet sent orders with the
newveommander of St. Louis of the Illinois, that
trade (hould be free with all the Indian tribes o*
the MilTouri and in the north ; in order to extend
our fur trade as far as pollible.
This information has put us in such fpiritsthat
we have determined to ereÂ£t a theatre and ball
room. It is almost completed. It would lead
me too far to enumerate the reforms and improve
ments that are made here : It will fuffice to tell
you, that refpeftable and enlightened merchants
have been appointed consular Judges ; that sons
are ereCting to put the colony in a relpettable situ-
Jtion ; that Mic lets and other legular troops
arearriving; and in one word, that tranquility
union and harmony have begun their reign in this

SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
The people of the United States are in pofleffion
of a government of their own choice âadminiiter-
ed by men of their own choice ; at the head of
whom is a name above all praise : These men
have been repeatedly the peoples' choice âand the
meafuresthey haveadopted have railed their coun
try from contempt to glory ; these measures
have proved that the authors were worthy of the
confidence of the people who chose themâfor these
measures have excited the opposition of a junio,
who will never be easy while this country is
happy.
But what are we told, and what do the Gazettes
fay, echo and re-echo through the union ? 44 That
poverty in the country, luxury in the capitals, cor
ruption and usurpation in the national councils.
National stock-jobbing, monarchy-jobbing, bank
jobbing and anftocracy-jobbing," are the blclfed
effe&s of placing the administration of our affairs
in the hands of a Congress chosen by the people,
and in the hands of such men as George Wash
ington, John Adams, Thomas J e fferson,
Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox, &c.
&c. For public and private virtue, what are
these men, compared to those who are now ma
ligning the government ?
Many persons indulge themselves in a strange
way of talking about perpetual laws. The word
perpetual is always used instead of standing
laws, as if it was ufeful to frighten us with the
found. Laws regulating property, fliould be as
liable aspollible. The manner of holding, trans
ferring and inheriting it, cannot be changed,
without some injury, and Hill more alarm.â
As a republican government is founded on com
pa&, aud on the inviolable nature of right, its
adminiftration,if it be wife and honest, will give
perfect security to property. Indeed, a man
cannot be said toenjoy property, if he entertains
the fear of its being invaded in his hands.

as a parent, and a husband, he was most kind ana

the loss of one so very dear to them, his brother
soldiers will drop a tear of fympaihy ; and all who
know his fate wi!! reflect, for a moment, on tht
uncertainty of life.

PASSED ATiTHE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS:
COLLATIO WITH, AND CORRECTED BY THE ORIGINAL
ROLLS IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
Price One Quarter of a Dollar.
THE ACTS of this felliou, agrcertbly to the plan of this edi
tion of the laws of the United States, will be considered as thÂ®
mrst part of the second volume; so that the aÂ£ts of each
Congress (the duration of which is limited by the conltuuiion to
Ihe term of two years) will becomprifed in one volume.
To the a6ls of this feflion will be annexed the ratifications of
the amendments to the Constitution ; the confederation between
the United States and the Delaware nation of Indians ; the treaty
between the United States and the Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa,
Chippewa, I'attawatimi and Sac Nations; the treaty between
the United States and the Cherokee Nation; and the armistice,
declaring a cessation of hostilities between the United States and
Great-Britain: Thcfe, with those in the firft volume of the laws
are all the existing treaties.
A copious index will accompany the feeond volumeâwhen
completed,at the end of the next session of Congress.
" As it is desirable that copies of the laws should be so multi
plied throughout the States, and in such cheap forms,as that every
citizen of the United States may be able to procure them," it has
been thought advifeable, in this.addition, to omit the signatures
of the President of the United States, the Prelident of the Senate,
and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Their signa
tures would have increased the fi*e of the volume, and eonfequrnt
ly have rendered it more expensive, without adding to its ufefuf
nefs or authenticity, inasmuch as the Secretaryof State's certificaie
is to be prefixed to the volume.
