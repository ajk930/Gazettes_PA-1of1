A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY fOHN FENNO, No. 69, HIGH-STREET, PHILADELPHIA
[No. 105, of Vol. lII.]
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES
MANY of the enlightened and humane have
for some time indulged a pleating hope
that the slave-trade, and perhaps fiavery itfelf,
will at length be aboliflied. What events of this
]<ind time may produce, cannot be ascertained at
present. But all, whose feelings and reason have
not been perverted, nmft be (hocked at the treat-
went which the unhappy Africans and their de-
fendants still altnoft universally experience in
the western world
ally, and perhaps from infancy, to treat their
{laves with contempt and inhumanity, slave hold-
ers seem frequently infenlible of the cruelty of
their condmft. Alk most of the Weft-India gen-
tlemen whether the Blacks are cruelly treated in
theiflands? " Not in general with any unnecef-
fary (everivy," they will reply, and talk of their
various privileges âprivileges which are tliem
i'elves the mod unequivocal proofs that almost
every thing is denied them which can render life
agreeable, and every thing inflicled which a ty
rant's caprice and passion may dictate. In the
view of a Weft-Indian , neither nakedness, liun-
ger, excessive labor, nor mangling stripes, are
unnecefiary severities to negroes. It is alien
ed that-the 'Africans are, in the Iftands. uled
*' with kindness and humanity" and at th?
fame time acknowledged, that thonfands are
annually imported. How amiably mild mull that
treatment be which destroys the human species
ft> much more rapidly than they propagate ! â
41 Sparta teemed with slaves at the time of her
liigheft fame as a valiant republic." Let it be
added-, that it was customary for this republic to
fend out her citizens at proper intervals to maflk
cre coolly the (touted of the Helotes, left they
ihould revolt. In the Weft-Indies, the slaves pe-
ri(h by millions, in a flower and more horrible
â way. But let us turn from this disagreeable
profoeftâlet us next ask an inhabitant of any of
the Southern States, whether slaves are there bar-
ibaroufly treated ? " Not at a,II (fays he) the in
â¢vecftives on that head are mere calumny and falfe
Jiood." Enquire more particularly as to their
food, cloathing, habitations, discipline, Src. and
yon will find that their peck of Indian corn is re
gularly mealured out to thetn ; a pittance just
.fufficient to prevent their starvingâthat they
have the privilege of exhibiting to gentlemen,
and (surprizing favor !) even to yonng ladies, a
great proportion if not the whole of their glofly
black bodiesâthat their hovels, when they are
not entirely destitute of a {helter, are perhapsfu
perior to hog llyesâand finally, that fait is some
times kindly applied to the furrows which the
lalh has made in their flefli.
The inhabitants of the middle and Northern
States will feverelV censure the Weft-Indian and
Southern (lave-holders. The humane European,
and unprejudiced American citizen, will in their
turn justly account these very cenfurers, or ra
ther some of them, guilty to a greater or lets de
gree of the fame barbarity. Who that has re
sided in any even of the lalt mentioned States,
where there is a considerable number of slaves,
has not seen many a poor black deltitute of cloth
ing necessary to keep out the wintry blast, or
even to cover their nakedness from the eye ?
Who has not heard well attefled relations con
cerning many a slave who has experienced conti
nually the pangs of hunger, whom not Itcknels
icfelf could excuse from an excessive and perhaps
unhealthy talk ?âln whose ears have not, at one
time or another, the cries of diitrefs and anguish
resoundedâcries for mercy answering the unre
ilrained flrokes of the lash, which leave their
marks for life .'âWhile filch treatment of slaves
proceeds from persons dead to every emotion but
those of pride, avarice and passion, reformation
from them is fcarcelv to be expected. We can
but lament that the fate of men fliould be decid
ed by fitch brutes. It is, however, a fad: too
well known to be denied, that slaves often expe
rience such treatment from persons who profefs
continually to obey the mild and equitable p: e
cepts of Cliriftianityâfrom persons who pride
ihemfelve* in their sensibility of loul â from per
sons who look on freedom as an invaluable right
from men otherwise the niolt re'petftable, and
women the most acoomplilhed. LSut surely in
this view, feeling, delicacy, fotmefs of manners,
humanity, love of liberty and religion, are all
deferred for that which is despicable, cruel and
vicious. SOCRATES.

(circular.)
SIR,
IN conformity to an appointment and from theol
ficers of the Maflachnietts line of the late American army,
have, attended at the seas of government from the 20th ot Mar
to ihe present period.
The object of my commiflion was to obtain a decision on
nemorial which had heretofore prefenred to Congress, 01
he fubjeft of further compensation for themselves and the sol
'iot s who served during the war. Although in the hrlt mftanc
iinilar applications were expend Irom those in the difteren
tates who were interested, yet that expe&ation was defea-ed by
clay of the communication contained in ihr circular ad<Jrcfs o
he 28 r h of Ft'bruaiy, and an idea that an earlier adjournment o
'ongrefs would have taken p'ace.
Finding myfelf thus situated, and considering that the of.cer
nd soldiers through the United S ales were equally intereftrd 11
he question, I deemed it a mark of refpeff and anention due
hem, not even to attempt a consideration of the fubje& unttl the
iad a fair opportunity of becoming attive applicants in the mea
u'cs we had adopted, and of ailording us the a;d of thÂ».ir advic<
nd affillance. . ,
As a proper investigation and decision of this question is ot th
lighcit importance, as it will afford relief to a large number o
ur companions of the war, whose dift'elf s are only equalled b
heir patience ; and as a union of sentiment and oi mcafuies wil
>e mod likely to produce the objc Â£t of our reasonable wilbes,
iave it in particular command frotn the ofÃcrs of M^fhchufetts
0 requcit * of rhe officers of your line, at the open
ng of the next fctlion of Con^rcfs.
They will attend aj that time by their agent or agents, and a fa
ial decision will doubtless be obtained.
As my brother officers in Massachusetts have eittiuiled this bu
m-fs to mv carp, and as I have devoted some attention to the con
1 deration of the fubjeft, I flatter myfelf you will not deem i; im
iroper in me, in this communication, to make ioruc general ob
ci vations thereon. . .
The claim of the army on the public, in my opinion, is lo fax
Â«1 in the unalterable principles of justice, that they ought to fee
he fulleft confidence of success.
The people of America know, and the public records will eve
icrpetuate the ferviccs wh'ch have been rendered, and t,he lnanne
n which they have been remunerated.âAn attempt to prove tha
dmnnd cf the most facrcd nature still remains uncancelled
could be only to 11k w that a part is less than rhe whole ; or -ha
wo, three, lour or five, ;re not equal to twenty. I lie cafe 11
-oint indeed is stronger than any which can be its sup
,ort ; and the feelings of every honcft heart will overcome evc.^
rgiiment which sophistry can devise or ingenuity invenj, in oppo
it ion to the claim.
Were I to attempt an investigation of the fubjeft, it would ap
irarfrom the molt authentic documents that the public ejigagc

been fully considered.âThey returned home under the disadvan
tages of having the habits of their formei occupations impaired
by their military pursuits, their property and connexions de
ranged and loft, and their families involved for a nefcrflary fup
pori.âThus circumstanced, neceility compelled them to dilpofc
of their certificates for the current price in the market.
After the prcfent government was eftabhfhed, provifmn v.-is
made for these certificates, wherever they were found.âBy that
provision the purchasers received an immense advantage.âThe
public however saved a part of the debt which was originally du<*
âtwo per cent, for ten years on the principal of the whole debt,
and half the interest which had accumulated. âThis remnant now
remains, and in paying it no more than the original debt will be
discharged.
The rival pretensions to this remnant will be the original hold
ers, who earned the whole by the sweat of their brow, and the
present holders, who have already received seven or eight hun
dred per cent, on the money which they advanced.
In the name of justice, equity, and good conscience, which
claim is to be preferred ? Every man will answer, that of the sol
dier ; unless his feelings are steeled against every principle of ho
nor, good faith, and gratitude.
This remnant theteforc, so far as it extends to our own original
claims, mav be appropriated with great piopriety to relieve the
fiifFerings of the foregoing description of men. In addition to
this, there can be no doubt but Congrcfswill be disposed to make
a liberal grant of land in the western territory, for the fame pur
pose, for it is not to be forgotten that those vail poileflTons, on
| which has been founded the pleasing expectation of finking the
whole of the public debt, are the fruits of those toils which the
government is now called upon to compensate.âl have or.ly, fi r Â»
to request you to take the earliest opportunity to make this com
munication known to the officers of your line, and I sincerely
hope at the opening of the next feflron of Congress, they will
think proper to make the application. 1 am, with every fen
timcnt of refpeÂ£l, in behalf G f the officers of the M-afiachufelis

CONGRESS.
FHILAUE L P H I A.liis officeâThat it is made his duty by law, is a
Sufficient apology for him in undertaking and
discharging it, but not for the House in transfer
iug it to linn ; I deny that the Honfe can be
bound by a law with refpedi to its powers and
dutiesâThis House is as free to originate money
bills as the lalt House was, and any future House
will be as free as thisâThe coiiftirution is the
only law whereby the powers and duties of this
House can be governed, nor can we either de
cline a duty or transfer a trull which has been
specially bound on us by it.âNor will I agree
with the gentlemen, that if it is an evil it arilcs
from necelfityâcertainly if we are capable of al
tering, amending, or changing the principles of
the Secretary's reports altogether, as is granted,
we must be capable with due industry and atten
tion to originate them ourselves.
But we are further told in defence of refering
to the Secretary, iliat if we do not do itonrfelves,
the comuiitte&employed, or some ofthe members,
will have reconi fe to the Secretary foraffiftance,
and that in this way his principles and argu
ments will be introduced with equal influence
fecretJyâand that it is better to face it openly,
and for all the members to have equal advantag
es from it.
This argument is plausible indeed, but will
not bear examinationâSo far is the method con
tended for from preventing private influence,
ihat it produces it in a much greater degreeâ
From the nature of the cafe we may conclude,
that a minister will not digest a revenue system
without adapting it to the views and interests of
a number of influential members, who will assist
him in preparing and influencing others to sup
port it when introducedâindeed it gives the
greatest poflible ftiinulus to private influence ;
for it not only combines an influential private
interest to support it, but the minister's charac
ter and the character of his friends, are much
higher pledged for its success, than if the influ
ence was privateâThus, I apprehend this me
thod is not only objevfiionable on account of the
ministerial fyltems and arguments which the
members receive in this House, and peruse in
their closets ; but also, on the account of the
greater inducement it must give to a more dan
gerous private influence, and in time to corrup
tion.
But the gentleman from North-Carolina, (Mr.
Steele) observes that we may upon the fame
grounds objert to the President's address, recom
mending business to the legillature ; thatmyfelf
and others who oppose the reference in question,
very lately advocated a report of tlie Secretary
of War, which he opposed ; that by carrying
the substance of that report into a law, we have
saddled the government with a debt for which
we are now about to provideâand he suggests
the impropriety of those, for whose immediate
defence the debt is incurred, objecting to the
usual method of providing for its discharge.
1 have observed already that the Prelident has
a right, created by the constitution, to recom
mend bnfinefs to the legislature, as well as to
give information of the (late of the Union; in
cor.feqnence of this trust he, by a report of his
Secretary, gave us information of the state and
misfortunes of the Indian war, and his opinion
of the force and expence that he judged necert'a
ry to enable him to bring it to a happy and
fpetdy conclusion ; this information was consti
tutional and neceflaryâwell knowing that an ina
dequate force and the short inliftments, rendered
the two lad campaigns difgraceful, and increased
the strength and irritation of the enemy.âl vot
ed (or the encreafe of the army, and for longer
enlillments ; but 1 voted for higher wages than
was reported, and we will yet re<*ret that this
was not agreed toâand I think in doing so I was
promoting the bed interests of the country, and
countenancing no unconstitutional influence
Surely if the gentleman would reflect for a mo
ment, he would not quote this as a precedent to
jullify this House in voting a transfer of the pe
culiar and exclusive constitutional privilege and
unalienable trull ol this House, to originate or
digest the principles of revenue, fyflems, to an
executive officer, not known in the constitution,
nor appointed by or dependant on this House.
I will further beg leave to inform the gentle
man, that the people of the frontiers do not claim
protection as a favor, they demand it as a light
- T hey know that protection and allegiance are
inseparableâthat if they are not protected, their
connection with the government is diflolved ; it
is their lot and their misfortune to be exposed
as a constant picquet guard to the interior inha
bitantsâtoo frequently has their habitations
been rendered desolate, and they have had their
dearest: relations butchered âWhen the ntlan
tic Jliores were the object of invaflon, the incle
mency of the season, nor the dangerous situation
of their families at home did not prevent them
from giving assistanceâThey have had little
weight in the councils which have, by affording;
inadequate means of protection, increased their
d lit re Is ; they think it ungenerous to be aided
with a too fpanng hand, and at the fame time
mlulred with unmerited reproach.
The gentleman fays he lias heard me -cften
moving to refer petitions to one or other of the
Secretaries myfelf-âI acknowjedge itâWhen
the petitions are for personal claims, being of a
judicial nature and connected with the docu
ments in the Secreiary's office, I think it proper
to refer them there for information with refpetft
to faiftsâWlien I moved for a reference of the
excise petitions which came in by me, 1 did it in
obedience to the customs of the House, but with
an express declaration that I thought the custom
then wrongâthis 1 have no doubt the members
will recolletft.
The genrlenian has also observed, that there
is independence and good feni*e enough in this
House to examine, to alter or rejetft a report of
the Secretary, notwithstanding his arguments
which accompany itâand that we have done so
in various instances. This 1 freely grant ânay
I advocate more than this, I believe there isgood
sense and independence enough in this House,
to digest and originate revenue systems without
the Secretary's doing it for us. But what does
this argument amount to ? Why it amounts to
giving the peculiar trust of originating to the
Secretary, and reserving that power to ourselves
which theconllitution vests in the other branch
â:the Senate cannot prepare a money-bill, but
they may alter, a'mend or reject such as we pre
pare and transmit to thein ; and they have done
foâls not this giving the power and influence
in a great degree ro the Secretary, which the
constitution gives to us !âls it not in fadt giving
up (he point ?âThe Sen'ate is not permitted
lo digell their arguments and transmit them to
us in support of business which they prepare,
neither are we permited to do so with them â
Nay it is unparliamentary to mention what we
think would be agreeable to the Senate or the
President, in our arguments on the floor, left it
(hould have the appearance of influencing the
measureâThe one branch cannot call upon the
other officially to originate businessâhow unrea
sonable then is it, to refer the mofi important
business to the Secretary to digest and prepare ;
and also to digest arguments for us, which we or
der to be printed and put into every member's
hand.
liut this method is highly objectionable on a
nother ground âit is putting the power of the
business out of our hands with refpe<ft to tlie
time of our deliberation ; this is certainly more
than we are authorized to do, or can be account
able for to our constituentsâlf this pra<flice be
comes established, 1 shall not befurprized to find
a minilter in connection with his friends in the
House. delaying to report 011 the most important
buiinefs until near the end of the fellion, when
many of the members are gone home, or so anx
ious to get home that there will not be a fuffici
ent opportunity for deliberationâsuch things
are not unusually attempted in public bodies
without the aid of a minilter ; in this House I
have heard the dole of a session mentioned as an
apology for the pafiage of an improper law it
is not nt'ceflary to create newfnares for the de
liberations of the House. Before 1 had the ho
nor of a feat in this House, I was informed ofthis
method of originating revenue fyfteins, and I al
ways thought it wrongâ lam not confident the
opposition 10 it will succeed at this time ; the
session is drawing near a close, and the oppofiti
-011 of members who advocate thepropofed refer
ence, may delay the business if originated in a
way disagreeable to them ; these reasons may
induce some members to vote for it now, that
would not do so in other circumstancesâhowe
ver if in is carried, I hope the precedent will not
be strengthened by a large majority.âFor my
part, 1 pledge myfelf to persevere in opposition
thereto ; and have no doubt but when a more
equal and more numerous representation occu
pies this floor, this unwarrantable pradtice of
transfering so influential a part of the legislative
irult, will be changed.

That neither the Legislative nor the Executive

That the duties alfigned to the Circuit Count

It is a truth beyond contradiction, that the

is want of rags ; the failure of the necellary flip

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
i SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
Experience is our belt teacher. âAccordingly
[ have been edified by perusing the concise re
marks of a gentleman from North-Carolina on
the debate occasioned by the motion to refer the
fubjet't of ways and means to the Secretary of the
Treasury. Theory and finefpun speculation of
ten bewilder us. But that gentleman with found
discretion and an acute political sagacity has ap
pealed to matter of fadi.-He has shewn that
so far is Congress from being awed or unduly
influenced by the opinions ot the Secretary, that
a ftri&er scrutiny has in no instance been made
even of the reports of committees appointed by
the House. In fliort, the reports from the Trea
sury have to run the gauntlet j they are exami
ned not only without favor, but with a degree
of caution perhaps, and suspicion and aversion
which their conformity with truth and policy
only can overcome ; and if uodue influence is
felt at all, surely those men who cry out are the
lead partial to the Secretary of the Treasuryâ
they do not speak for themselves but others. It
is not the most modest thing in the world to fay,
we are sure we are honest and firm, but those
who vote agaiiift our judgment are rogues, and
only to be restrained from mifchief by our al
ways watching and fomeiimes tying them.
SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
Is any thing more absurd than to charge go
vernment with the lollies and thai
some frantic people exhibit in confecjiience of
its funding law ? The price of any thing de
pends on the demand for itâover-fpeculanng it
is true hJi increased the demand ior stock and
brought many perlons into (crapes. But the ex
port of grain while Europe was hall famifhed
was in like manner pushed to excels. At that
time the farmers did not blame Congress because
they got an high price. \ou may talk to the
wind and the tide, and will they mind you ? If
too much is given at one time for the stock, what
is to be done but to let the lol'ers learn wit by
paying for it. Those who condemn the excel'
live speculations which have taken place will
have the comfort to fee that the evil has nearly
cured iifelf. If folly is let alone it will tax it
felf to death.
It feerns remarkable that some of the known
and declared enemies of the government affect
to love and understand it better than us friends.
What would the constitution prove to be worth
if its admirers after having adopted fhonld leave
to its foes to interpret it? Those who have ho
ped to fee America rife as a nation would fee
that their hopes are built on the sand.
" Oppolition to the measures of government"
is a different thing from " offofing" %he govern
ment itfelf ; this is said-yea the point of homf
ty is said to turn on this oppofuionâbut, it the
nieafures of government are founded on the de
cisions of the majority, honefly it must appear, lias*
commenced hostilities with repubheamfm.
A correfpondenrobferves that while ihofe who
participate of the favors of government are con
(tantly ifl'uing complaints against its measures
and its ministers, we have Purely nothing to fear
from bribery and corruption.
