Verjijied from an ancient writer in the Gallic language.
X-jOUD bowls t'ie windâthe (bowers descend,
The mountain Spirit (creamsâ
The windows flapâthe tall woods bend
And roar the rain-fwol'n streams :
To ford the torrent, fad the wand'rer triesâ
But hark! o'er-whclm'd, he (hrieksâhe dirs
Swift down the hill rugged and steep,
The affrighted bcafts retireâ
The hunter rouses from his sleep.
And wakes the flumb'rmg fireâ
He bars the windâ'round the hearth the while
His wet dogs smokeâcompanions of his toil.
Sad on the distant mountain's fide,
The lonely fhephcrd sighsâ
And bids, his wand'ring steps to guide,
The iing'ring moon a rifeâ
While the sorest roars,
And down the rock the headlong torrent pours.
The Ghost rides lightly on the storm â
Loud arc it's cries, and fhiill ;
The houfc-dog barks--the lhadowy form
Flies o'er the misty hill :
Cold, daik and gloomy is the scene,
Anfe, my friends, and let the wand'rer in.

PEOPLE govern their opinions, and, in the
event, their condudl by their feelings and
wifties. In company, you will fee mtfn of
sense and merit taking part againlt aathoriiy,
and on the fide of those who insult and resist it
on almost every occasion ; they seem to think it
a dury to do so, because they wifli to strengthen
the caofe of (he people : and in the second place,
government being always strong enough, often
so strong as to encroach, is not the worse for be
ing abuled and pelted back somewhere within
its lawful boundary lineâit is thought at any
1 ate, but indulging a good propeufity. This
may be very honed conduct, but is it wife and
proper ?
Under a bad government the people have some
thing to getâscorn and calumny and public ha
tred may controul the miiiions.of despotism, and
make the government afraid to go to extremi
ties.
In America, the government is as free as can
be desired, or leafonably conceived. The pro
per care of the people is, not to extend their
own ground, not to attack the government, but
if poflible to make it immortal : As in France, so
in America, the constitution is the fan<ftuary
where liberty takes (helter from violence ; it is
not what has been got from the peopleâit is
what they have got tor thenifelves and mean to

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, December 19.
DEBATE ON THE REPRESENTATION BILL.
[Continued. J
[The Senate had amended the bill by encreafing the ratio from 30,000
to 33,000 ; the House had difa greed to this amend*:;nt ; the Senutc vo
ted to adhere. It ums moved m the House this day t that they Jhoutd re
cede J turn their difagr cement .3
Mil. MAbISON, after making a few prefato
ry observations, said he felt himfelf impell
ed to take some notice of the arguments that had
been nfed this day, on the fubjedt before the
House : he would not, however, attempt any re
ply to the gentleman from New-Jersey, nor pre
tend to follow him iu hit flights of imagination
refpe&ing the New-Jerusalem or the umpirage
of Pennsylvania, but leave it to those to whom
such observations might have been addrefled to
draw their own concTulions. He was sorry that
it almost always happened, whenever any quelti
on of general policy and advantage to the union
was before the House, when gentlemen found
theinfelves at a loss for general arguments,
tbey commonly resorted to local views ; and at
all times as well as the present, when there was
most occasion for members to adt with the utinoft
coolness, when their judgments ought to be the
lead biafledâit was to be regretted that at those
times ihey fuffeved their feelings, palGons and
prejudices to govern their reason. Thus it is
that the most important points are embarrafled,
the northern and southern interests are held up,
every local circumfiance comes into view, anil
every idea of liberality and candor is banilhÂ«|d.
The gentleipan from New-York, (Mr t Law
rance) when he introdoced this fubjedt at the
commencement of the prel'ent session, did it on
the most generous plan, and disavowed every
principle of calculation so much, that he then
declared he had not so much as made a single
calculation of the different fractions which have
since been introduced into the debateâhis only
object'was to fix a rule on general principles, a
greeably to the conltitucion and to the
tion of the rights of the people ; and this idea
was approved by two of the gentlemen from NeW-
Jersey, who have since altered their
although they then had no objections but as to
the expence : the idea of fractions was not then
contended for, but has since becoine the very eÂ£
fence of the opposition ; and we are called on
to violate the constitution by adopting a meafurc
that will give representatives for ihofe separate
and diftimt fractions in the refpetflive states ;
and afterwards are rold it is not to |the fraifti
onal numbers in the states that they refer, but to
the aggregate of the fractions in the United
States. If this reasoning is good, why do the
gentlemen flop at this boundary of a representa
tion by states ? why not proceed to eredt the
whole of tha United States into one diftridt,with
out any division, in order to prevent the inequa
lity they conceive taexift in refpett to individu
al dates !He would Hot encroach upon the timeof the
House by protradling the debute,which had alrea
dy swelled to an immoderate extent. Upon the
whole, he said that this was a great queition,
wherein attention ftiould be paid to the people,
and a strict eye kept towards the public good,
divetted of prejudice ; but he had heard with
pain how much had been said to divert the Houle
an attention to fractions, from the true ob
ject of general welfareâyet-he hoped that the
government would be equally administeredâthat
none of those predictions or threats thrown out
in the course of the debate, that 110 mutilation of
the union, would take place ; but on the contra
ry, that harmony would guide the decilion ol
this ( queftion, free from every local considerati
on.
Mr. Hillhoufe.âlt lias often been said this go
vernment is a government of confidenceâan<l tak
ing this for granted, can it ever be supposed that
a plan of repiefentation, which is unequal and
unjust, can excite this confidence. This ratio of
30,000 throws an additional weight of 7 repreien
tatives into the fcalc of the large states. If this
principle can be established on this occasion, it
may be also extended to taxation. Notthern and
southern interests have been mentionedâhe was
sorry the idea had ever been suggestedâbut as it
had, there was 110 impropiiety in adverting to it
let a line then be drawn at any given place,
and a ratio established which will do equal jus
tice to the members on both fides of that lineâa
repiefentation that will deviate from such a prin
ciple, it cannot be expeifted, will give fatisfatlion
or be chearfully fubuiiued to by the people.â
The ratio of 35,000, figures will (hew it, will
give a more equal repiefentation than that of
30,000, âand there has not, aijd, in his opinion,
lie said, could not be any good reason alligued
â why it ftiould not be adopted.
Mr. Boudinot said he was pleased when gen
tlemen were desirous of appealing to candid and
fair argument, in determining important quefti
ons.âln the present cafe, he thought there was
propriety in examining the principles of the bill
and amendment, by the terms of the constitution
âIt had been said by gentlemen, that the ratio,
when adopted, must be applied to the number of
citizens in the individual states, and that no re
gard was to be paid to the fractions occasioned
thereby, because not regarded by the conllituti
onâThis he thought, was no means conclu
live.âThe House of Representatives was to con
sist of members'chofen every second year, by she
people of the several statesâthese members not
to exceed the proportion of one to 30,000. âIt
appeared to him that the whole number of repre
sentatives, to be chosen by the whole people of
the union, was the fubjeift contemplated by the
constitution ; as eonftituting this branch of the
legislature, while by another part of the confti
tu;ion, it becomes the duty of Congress, tÂ» appor
tim them when so afcertained,among the several
states in proportion to their refpediive numbersâ
As an instance, suppose for arguments fake, the
aggregate number of the citizens of the United
States, to be exactly three millions, by applping
the ratio of 30,000, the constitutional number of
this House would be found 100 âCongress fliould
then proceed to apptrtio?i (for he could apply no
other meaning to the word) the too members a
mong the States, as their rcfpecftive numbers bore
a proportion to the whole number of three milli
onsâThus the representatives from every state
would bear an exatft proportion to each other,
according to the number of inhabitants in the
state ; and the whole repi efentation would stand"
on principles of perfect equality. An equal re
presentation appears to have been the desirable
objetft of the framers of the constitutionâit is the
very spirit of our government. He infilled that
this was the only mode of applying the ratio,and
making the apportionment that would hold good
at all times, and under all circumstances. hcan
not be said with propriety, that the constitution
does not proceed on principles of perfect equali
ty in this House, yet if the ratio be applied to
the numbers in the individual states, it will al
ways produce (as has been fully ihewn by seve
ral gentlemen) very great inequality, by large
fractions being unavoidableâin one state we now
find one upwards of 29,000. He acknowledged
the amendment did not proceed 011 this prin
ciple any more than the bill, for which rea
foil he fully approved of neither, but as the ratio
of 33,000 in the amendment produced a much
greater equality, and came in efFecft nearer to his
principle,.(by reducing the fractions made by
the bill nearly two thirds) he should prefer it,
as he must vote for the one or the other.
It had been (aid that they were making distinc
tions between the north and the fonthâbetween
the large and finall statesâHe observed in an
swer, that if gentlemen would introduce princi
pies of inequality, that bore unconstitutionally
hard on individual states, they ought not* to take
it amiss, that the fuffering states would complain
of the injusticeâThe injured must complain,and
the fault, if any, lies with the firft trainers of
the principle.
If gentlemen wiflied for equality, let them ad-
here to the principles of the constitution. Ap
ply the ratio to the whjle number ot citizens, by
which you find the number of representatives to
constitute this House, and then apportion those
representatives among the individual' Rates ac
cording to their refpeiftive numbers.
When gentlemen advert to the Senate, and
fay that the equal representation ot the final!
states there, (hould be taken into the account,
they do not consider the relative situation of the
states as reprefentcd in that Houseâthere the lo
vereignty of eacli state is represented, and not
the individual citizenâsovereignty is perfectly
equal in every stateâAs sovereigns there are no
great or (inall, and if his information had been
right, it was on that principle that the Senate
was originally constituted, but that House was a
representative of every individual citizen. On
the whole, he was of opinion that by agreeingto
the amendment of the Senate, they would secure
the great principle of equality better than by the
bill.
Mr. Boudinot thought the construction he had
given the constitution was a true oneâlt support
ed the spirit of (the confederation between the
states, which was on the footing of perfedt equa
lity in proportion to numbersâlt coincided with
the Ipirit of our government, which was equality
âAnd although by it, the number of members
constituting the House was firft ascertained from
the whole people aggregately considered, with
out refpedt to the division of states, in their poli
tical capacity, yet by the after apportionment a
mong the refpeiftive states in that capacity, the
wisdom of the constitution appealed in thus pro
viding a general government for general purpos
es, and at the fame time making each individual
state (as a state) eflential to the exiltence of that
government, thereby preventing in the nioft ef
fectual manner an unneceflary entire consolida
tion of the union. Mr. B. said he had originally
objected to the bill on account of a toa numerous
and expensive representation, as well as of an
unequal one, but chiefly relied on the last as un
constitutional, and therefore should (till prefer a
1 concurrence with the Senate.
Mr. Gerry observed, that it had been fafhiona
ble to speak of the ratio of 30,000 as a federal
number ; he did not know what name to give to
the amendment of the Senate, unless it were call
ed the fractional number. He then took notice
of an argument which had been used to create
suspicion, that was danger to be apprehend
ed from a combination of the larger Hates ; but
this would appear a weak argument when it was
confidere'd that the power and influence of the
smaller dates are equal in the Senate to ihofe of
the greater ltatesâthe thing is impossible, and if
attempted it could not succeed.
He wiflied to know whether it was the opinion
of gentlemen, that there was less judgment and
less firmnefs in the House of Representatives than
in the Senate ? He hoped an equipoise would be
preserved in the two branches, and that the ba
lance would not be destroyed by conllantly giv
ing up the judgment of the House to every whim
of the Senate. If a latitnde be now admitted,
that we lyay increase the ratio, before the expi
ration of the firft ten years, the gentlemen in fa
vor of the Senate's amendment may infill on a
ratio of 50, or 60,000 ; but this is ground they
know they cannot yet touch upon ; and the fame
reason that (hould prevent us from adopting this
extreme, operates against the amendment. The
whole expence of Congress, from adopting the
ratio in the bill, will not amount to two cents up
on each citizen of the United States annually,and
as population encreafes it will be lessened, Sure
ly the gentlemen in favor of the amendment can
not obje<S to this trifling expence. They speak
of a liberal policy ; 1 wish they would (hew us an
example by agreeing to the bill with a better
grace than they seem to have exhibited hitherto.
Mr. Murray. The fubjecfl has gone through a
very ample difcufiion. When the question of re
presentation firft came on, the theory of the go
vernment was ably resorted toby those who urg
ed a large representation. Sir, I most heartily
agreed in the principle on which by a large ma
jority this House made 30,000 the ratio. As I still
am of that opinion, I (hall be indulged by this
House while I give my reasons for adhering with
a firmnefs which may be deemed by some tenaci
oufnefs, to a rejection of the amendment of the
Senate.
I voted for 30,000 because I saw in that ratio
the constitutional wishes and expectations of the
people. I deemed the largest possible ratio al_
lowed by the constitution to he the source of na
tional government, and its bell security, "No
thing, fir, which I have yet heard has convinced
ine to the contrary. It is unnecellary to recapi
tulate whatever has been said 011 this point. I
inuft remark, however, that during the difcuilion,
the members of this House who suggested that
principle appeared to me to be convinced. They
seemed to be matters of their own opinions, and
to agree in this idea, without adverting to the
dodirine of fractions, that the sole question was
a point of theory rather than a meal'ure of ex
pedience ; and they decided by a very large nia
290
jority, that in this House, immediately warm
from the very bosom of the people, the ratio ot
30,000 was theoretically correct and practically
ulefiil. The bill was lent up to the Senate, who
returned it with an amendment of 13,000 as the
ratio. 1 voted against that amendment, because
it was an attack upon the principle of an enlarg
ed representation ; and because the idea of frac
tional representation aimed at by the amend
ment, was but a commutation of the evil of frac
tions from one State to another, from the eastern
on the southern j and contained a fuj'tender ot
the principle without an of conve
nience.
Sir, it has been in the 'course of debate
foretold, that that honorable body would be a -
verse to an enlarged representation here. What
ever has been augured, has been verified by ex
perience ; nor can any nun be at a lols to lee
that the temper against large representation,
though not openly avowed, for t-hat would have
been impolitic, has been covertly and luccefsful
ly exerted under the semblance of 1 -quality of re
presentation, by this doiftrine of fractions, it
was sent down into this House in the form ot
jealousy and ful'picionâand it has produced its
effeifts. It has roused the latent and local inter
ests from their plans, and we have had debates
entirely conftrudted 011 the tenets of northern
and southern interests and influence.
A proposition was made by a member from
New-York, ( Mr. Benfon ) and reiterated by
the gentleman from Delaware. The object ot
rhis proposition was to sum up the fractions, and
from the aggregate take seven .members. Sir, if
1 was furprilied, I confefs I was deligliied to fee
men who a few days before had opposed in the
ory the idea of a large representation, come down
with moderation, and fugged this great princi
ple even in a bad form. 1 imagined they were
converted. I voted aj>aind this proposition, be
cause 1 thought it, firft, unconstitutional, inaf
mucb as it could have been contemplated but in
the consolidation of dates ; and because I tho't
it contained a solecism in politics. 1 deemed it
unconditional, as the conditution calls for a
representation of the people of the rtfpsÃive
states in a ratio of 30,000 ; and if this had ob
tained it was to be done by collecting the frag
ments of condiments from dates widely separate,
and giving a representation of their fractions
thus divided to that date which had the largest
fraction. Thus, fir, the two from Delaware
would be chosen by less than the condiiution
contemplates, as there are not 60,000; and it is
in vain to fay that the member chosen by 25,000
is elected by the addition of 5,000 in any other
date in order to complete his proper number of
condituents, for they do not eltÃ him : and if it
be laid that he nevertheless does repiefent them
as his condituents, it can only be by the idea of
a consolidation having pre-exided, which no man
has yet openly averred to be the doctrine on this
subject. The very, firft and mod intelligible
principle of representation in government is that
the representative is rcfponfible to his conditu
ents ; bur, fir, this, though an abdract truth,
mud be shown to the people not in a fiction, but
in a solid and practical mode, congenial with
their habits,and palpable to their underdandings.
In the adoption of this extraordinary proposi
tion, the idea of virtual representation is the on
ly one which at all protects it. No man, howe
ver, who knows the country, will tamper and
trifle with so solid a part of government as that
of actual representation and actual responsibility.
I never, fir, could consent to commute a known
and practical meal'ure of good, for a flimfy (pe
culation which could only have been invented to
serve particular views, and was never thought of
till it was difcovcred in what manner the fracti
ons would affect particular dates.
For these reasons, Sir, I voted against that pro
pofitioti. I (hall now vote against the amend
ment of the Senate, because 1 find no cute, but
a partial one, for the inconvenience of fractions ;
and even this is to be obtained at the expence of
principle. Though this amendment may gratify
some States, as New-Jersey, that may have large
fractions, it throws off the evil from them on
other Slates. The fracftion of Maflachufetts may
be (mailer, but the State of Maryland loses a
member and will have a large fraction. Sir, I
can find nothing in this amendment but the de
sign to accomplish what I humbly conceive an
uuwholefome end by improper means, and (hall
therefore vote against the proposed amendment.

The following resolution was adopted in the Houfeof Repre
sentatives of this Common wealth, and sent to the Senate for their
concurrence, on Thuifday last.
That in commemoration of the important and meritorious ser
vices rendered to his country by Ciorce Washington, whose
character and conduct have triumphed in proportion to the diffi
culties thev have encountered, and have attracted the admiration
and refpeft of all nations where valour and virtue are held in esti
mation, there be procured at the public's expence, a full length
portrait painting and marble bust, expreflive of his per foil, and as
far as poflible charafteriftic of his talents.
Refolvcd, That the said painting and bust be depofued where
everthe Legislature (hall deem expedient.
Prejudices are battered down by writersâyet, prostrate in the
dust, they maintain their authority over the multitude. They re
sist reason, Hut they yield to time. They must be fuffered, even in
the counfcls of nations, to wc#r out. No truth is better proved,
than that trade should be free : yet not one nation has fully yield
ed obedience to the principle. Commercial reftriÂ£tions and pro
hibitions are even multiplying, and the hands of industry, (one
would almost tear) are going to be bound fatter than ever. This
is the golden age, tho not in the fabulous sense. The desire of
wealth governs politics, as well as trade ; the aflembly house, as
well as the work-shop. The enquiry, in the former, is only, how
shall we make a law to increase the riches ot the people? The
answer is, by letting them aloneâgive their industry room to atl
in, without the obftru&ion of government's meddling, and it will
find its own reward. The European nations, unfortunately for
them, and for the world, have colonies ; the system ot commercial
monopoly follows the system of conquest. Tis there that one
abuse is made to produce, and to juftify, another. Every trading
nation needs some naval defence ;âbut the ambition and avarice
of the great maritime powers, havtvcairied these burdens to an
oppreflive extreme. A great navy, they pretend, must be kept no
to defend colonies, and seamen must be hired to catch cod-fifh
and whales, at three times their worth, to man a navy. All their
(hips barely fuffice to defend their monopoly; a tenth part of
them would protect a free trade. But it is fortunate for mankind
that the excels of these abuses is providing a cure for them, The
colony and monopoly system of Europe has kindled their wars;
their navies have been the chief instrument and heaviest charge of
them. Their national debts have been contracted, in a great mea
sure, to defray that charge. They have drained all that the mo
nopoly of trade could supply, and more is still wanting; and now
they begin to perccive, that free trade only can furnifh ft.
Before the constitution of the United States was adopted, or
even published, the opinion of the public was fettled on this
point, that the old form of government was carrying us hastily
forward into anarchy and ruin ; men of fenle and virtue w< re
zealous and aÂ£live in using arguments and perfuaftons to get the
constitution received by the people. Then they watched and la
boured long and hard and succeeded ; they felt an affe&ion for
the work they had so much assisted : But now the government is
going prosperously forward, it is to be apprehended, that such
men will withdraw their attention and affe&ion, at least in a
gteat degree ; they will fay let it now take care of itfclf, it is able
to doitâBut they may have cause to lament their neglect; a
thousand occasions happen in which a good government would
almost stop Us course if it was not affiftcd by the zeal and virtue
of the men of abilities and merit who live under it.
The only reason aiTigned for enhancing the postage ofnewfpa
pers sent more than 100 miles, fifty per cent, is, that it will pre
vent a monopoly of the business on the part of those Printers who
publilh at the Seat of Government, to the injury of the Printers at
the Southward, where labor and materials in that line, are dearer
than at the Northward. This is one of those bad rules fhat will
not work, both Wavsâfor if it would tend to equalize the matter
at the Southward, it will entirely prevent any papers being sent
to the Northward.
The half cent originally proposed as a postage on newspapers,
would be found fully competent to defraying everv expence. All
that is to be considered with refpeft to the contraÂ£l;> tor carrying
the mail, is the weightâthe trouble would not be encre-ifed, pro
vided all newspapers were lodged in the poft-office, as they ought
to beâbut it has never yet been made to appear that the newspa
pers might not be included in all the mail contrasts, without one
faithing's addition to the expence.
A writer in the Farmer's Journal, printed at Danbury, (Conn.)
fays Were some regulation established whereby editors of pe
riodical works might rcceive commnnications tree of postage, the
publishers of the National Papers would, undoubtedly, re
ceive many entertaining and inftruftive essays, from every part of
the Union, which are now withheld for want of a proper convey
ance.

REVENUE LAW
By JOHN NEVILLE, Inspector of the Revenue,
Survey No. 4, District Pennsylvania
(CONTI NUED.)
FIFTH objeCtion. 44 The duty in question is a lax on a D<>-
44 meftic Manufacture which good policy would rather en
-44 courage than consider as a fourceof revenue."
Answer. Congress have given strong proofs in every feflioo of
their anxiety to encourage manufactures of all kinds which pro
mise to be fuccefsful. When domestic manufactures aie in their
infancy, it is impolitic to make ihem an objeCt of revenue ; but
when they have attained to maturity, and the produCts of them
are in general consumption, then they become as fair objeCts of
revenue as any that can be imagined. No good reason to ihe con
trary can poflibly beafligned. No interest in the community is
injured by it ; not even, that of thr manufacturer himfelf, if care
be taken to lay a duty on the foreign manufacture of the lame na
ture. In the present instance they have gone further, they have
laid a duty on molafles of three cents per gallon, which being a
foreign raw material for diftillation,the manufacturer from na
tive materials will find it on reflection a solid encouragement to
him. Wherever the duty on the foreign manufacture is greater
than on the domestic manufacture, the difference is a bounty on
the domestic manufacture. It is a general rule, that the duty is
included in the price of the article. If therefore, that on the fo
reign article is greater than that on the home-made article, the
price of the former must rife so much the higher ; and the latter
by being able to be afforded cheaper, will have a proportionable
advantage in the market.
This principle is so clear and so well established, that it is not
poflible to understand and yet to dispute ir, and the confequcnce
of it is, that the law in question, instead of bearing hard upon
the domestic mannfaflure, is a positive, direÂ£f, and great en
couragement of it. If nine cents per gallon are laid on spirits
distilled from domestic materials, eleven cents per gallon are laid
on those distilled from foreign materials, and an addiThynal duty
of nine cents, making in the whole twenty cents per gallon, on
foreign imported spirits of the lame strength, and more on the
flronger kinds.
Spirits distilled from domestic materials go into market, there
fore with an advantage over those distilled in the United States
from foreign materials, greater, by two cents per gallon, and with
an advantage over foreign imported spirits, greater by eleven cents
per gallon, than if there was no duty upon any of them. Is not
this a solid encouragement to the manufacturer, and would it not
be full as reasonable to complain, that the proposed land tax was
a discouragement and unjust burden on agriculture, as that a con
tribution of lels than half ofthr foreign rate is a discouragement
to the making of spirits at home.
But in fa& the advantage accruing from the law to spirits dis
tilled from domestic materials is ftili greater than has been men
tioned. It is ascertained, that those stills which have full em
ployment, by paying sixty cents per gallon of the capacity of the
llill, do hot pay any more than about five cents per gallon on foi
rits distilled. F
Hence it is evident that the committee have, in this refpeft re
ally mistaken the true effect of the law, which, instead of injuring,
is calculated to promote the domestic manufa&ure : the fame re
mark applies to the presentment of the grand jury of a county of
South-Carolina, the only grand jnry who have noticed the law.
So true is this, and so well is it understood, in some parts of the
United States, that, if I am not greatly mifinformed, there are
persons who intend to begin new distilleries from domestic ma
terials upon a large scale, merely upon the strength of this advan
tage in favor of the country ftilis.
1 he committee point their complaint to the duty on spirits dis
tilled from domestic materials, and seem not unwilling that the
duty on spirits distilled from foreign materials {hould remain.
Will not this clearly prove to us, how liable weare to error, when,
under the influence of a local view of a fubjeft, we censure laws
founded on general information and a knowledge of the circum
stances of all parts of the community? In the States north of
Pennsylvania there are very few distilleries from domestic ma
terials ; but they have heretofore distilled from foreign materials
as much as is produced from all the distilleries of domestic mate
rials in the United States. The distillation of spirits from fo
reign materials is, to the New-England States particularly, a
manufacture ol the firft importance. What would those
Slates have a right to fay, if a duty {hould be laid on their manu
facture, and not on yours of the fame or a similar article ? They
would surely have a right to complain of the unkind partiality of
government. Ought not the citizens of these western counties
to be fatisfied, if they are content, that our spirits {hall pay upon
an average four cents per gallon less than theirs? and can you
doubt that the difference will promote your manufa&ure ?
Your distance from a market, cannot, as is alledged, render
the duty more burdensome to you than to others. As to the part
which you shall consume at home the effect of the law will only
be to add the duty to the price, and the fame thing willl happen
every where else : as to what you may fend to a distant market,
the expenceof transportation will be no greater by the dutv than
it was before; and as you will find an increased price there, in
proportion to the duty, you can lose nothing ; you will even gain
whatever the makers of lpirits in the vicinity of those markets
are able to add to the price by way of advance to the duty.
It appears, then, that you will not pay a larger part of the du
ty than others, unless it can be {hewn that you drink more ardent
spirits than your fellow-citizens in othei parts of the country.
This I hope and believe is not true. It would be an indecent
imputation against you, which could not fail to excite your in
dignation, to represent you as the least fobcT and temperate part
of the people of the United States.
If it be said that other parts of it drink other liquors in greater
quantity, it may be answered, that this is not the cafe as a general
rule, and that as far as it is true, the difference is much more than
made up on the higher duties which are laid on those articles.
Fellow-citizens, I know too well the justice and generosity of
your tempers, not to be convinced, that you will fufficiently feel
the force of this reflc&ion, when it is brought into your view. If
it {hould be even true (as it does not appear to be) that you pay
something more in proportion of the duty in question, than your
fellow citizens in other quarters, how lon* a lift of articles is there
upon which those fellow-citizens as consumers pay heavy duties,
which either affeÂ£lyou not at all, or very little indeed.
Sixth objection. 41 The scarcity ofcalh renders the duty a par
-41 ticuJar grievance. It is questionable whether all the circulating
" ' n 'he country would be fufficient to pay it."
Answer. This, if true, is an objection, not to the particular
duty in question, but to any other duly or tax whatever. It can
not, therefore, be urged as a special or particular objection to this
particular tax. The people of tbis part of the country do not ex
pert to (hare in the peace, security and prote&ion of government,
without contributing any thing to its support. They expect to be
guarded from foreign subjugation, and from savage depredations;
but they are too just to admit that the money ought to betaken
out of the pockets of their fellow-citizens throughout the Unittd
ON THE
States, to Day the troops for their defence, and to purchase their
produce for the subsistence of those troops, without bearing any
part of the burden ; or it must be alledged that you are totally
unable to contribute, and will accept protection from the reft of
tfye people of the United States.
Such expe&ations, fellow-citizens, arc really the amount of
the objection lad stated. You are too reafonablc, and have too
much honed pride and spirit, to be willing to owe your security
to the bounty and protection ot others, without contributiug
your proportion of the neceifary means.

Such Gentlemen as hold Subscription Pafers, he begs will
return them to him at Worcejler, or to him and Company at Bofion,
by the lad day of November next, and as much sooner as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work lias been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highest approbationboth as to the execution of the
printing, its correftnefs, and us chcapnets compared with EnglilK
copies of the fame size and quality.
As this verv laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
is carried on solely at his own i oft, he is led to hope that all those
who wish to pofiefs a large Family Bible, will so far encourage this
laudable undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
to the fubferiqtion.
