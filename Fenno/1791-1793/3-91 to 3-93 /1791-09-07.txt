the more interelting and agreeable 10 (he Imperial Academy tij ci
cuces, that the fame matter is the fubjea ol a premium, even now
proposed by our academy ; as you will fee by the printed adver
lifement, which I fend vou herewith.
The proerefs you have already made, gives me a plealant hope,
this important matter will derive no small increafc Irom your in
genious works; add I make no doubt, but your labours will great
ly contribute to the final solution of this queftioti.
' By the communication of your fur her enquiries and di cove-
Tics (especially relating to the souther.i hemifpheie, the calculation
of the univcrfal set of tables, and the afcertaming the ex ast revolu

a Greater number of observations) you will very much oblige
Your humble servant,

THIS Royal Academy has received by two different ways,
nearly at the fame time, your explanation of a Magnetic Atlas.
Commiflion was inÃantly given to gentlemen of the protdnon and
mathematicians, members of the society, tocxamme it acru.alely,
and to bring in their advice in some of the ordinary academica
meetings. This they i ave performed, and I am din&ed to ten
You in this letter the result of their examination and 3dvice.
' They acknowledge the originality and ufcjulnejs of your ideas
and icheme, and that both highly deserve to m a!'
ihinkthe observations are not yet so much, nor to tully eltat)in -
cd, as to enable impartial readers to form an absolute judgment ol
the matter. . .
They believe indeed, that when the proportions you enunciat
â¢will be demonllrated, a great step will be made owards the per
jcÂ£tion of magnetic knowledge* Thele demondratiofts thcycx
pcÂ£l from you, and in the mean while they readily acc pt : theinvi

The Address of the Reprefentativa of the African Church offaid City
Respectfully Sheweth,
Til AT a number ot Afnrans, and the defendants of A r ncans,
'belonging lothe city of Philadelphia, have aflociated for the
purpose ol eftablifliing religious worship and difeiplineamong their
brethren : thereby hoping to produce more order and happiness
among them, than could be introduced, while a majority ot them
are ignorant and unknown to any religious lociety ; and while
the few who worftiip God, arc the scattered and unconnefleii
appendages of molt of the religious focieiieain the city â'1 hat men
re more influenced in their morals by their equals, than by their
Superiors, where they exceed a certain rank, and that they are
more eaftly governed by pcrfons chosen by themselves tor that
purpose, than by persons who are placed over them by acciden
tal circnmftanccs. That the attraflioo and relanonlhip which
are rftabiilhed among the Africans, and their defcendanis, by
i lie I'aincnefs of colour, by a nearly equal and general deficiency
of education, by total ignorance, or only humble attainments in
religion, and by the line drawn by cuttom as well as natuie, be
tween them and the white people, all evince the necellitv and
propriety of their enjoying separate and exrlufive means and op
portunities ot worflii pping God, of inftru&ing their youth, and
of taking care of their poor. To enable them to carry these im
portant obje&s into execution, they arc under the neceflity of ap
plying to the friends of libert and religion, in the city of Phila
delphia, for .ifliftanceto ercd a Church for the benefit of their
focietv. They recoiled with heartfelt gratitude the many a&s
Â«Â»f kindness they have received from the citizens of Philadelphia.
By patronizing the prcfent undertaking, they will convert their
numerous favors into fubflantial and durable blcflings, and per
haps l>v this frcfli ast of charitv, they may lay a foundation for
Similar churches, being established among the Africans, and their
defendants, in other States, as well as tor the fame fucceG in ex
tending the Goi'pel of Jesus Christ to their brethren in Africa,
which thedefcendantk of Europeans in America have had in ex
tending fieedom to the nations of Europe.

A PICTURE OF GOVERNMENT, A LA MODER.NE,
DRAWN BY AN OLD MASTER
IN the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Woujd I admit, no name of magistrate;
Letters Ihouid not be known; poverty and riches.
And use of service, none; contrafls, fucceffinn,
Bourn, bond of land, tilth, vineyard, olive, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation, all men idle, all,
And women too, but innocent and pure ;
No foverrigniy :
All things in common, nature (hould produce
Without sweat or endeavour; treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature (hould bring forth
Of its own kind, all foifon, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.
I would with t'uch perfection govern, Sir,
To excel the golden age.
TO NIGHT A SONNET.
lI.OVE thee, mournful fober-fnited night,
When rhe fair inoon, yet ling'iing in her wane,
And veil'd in clouds, with pale uncertain light
Hangs o'er the waters of the reftlcfs main.
In deeo depreflion funk, the enfeebl'd mind
â \Vi!l to the deaf, cold elements complain,
And trll th* embofom'd grief, however vain,
To fiillen forges and the viewlets wind.
Though no repose on thy dark brcaft I find,
1 {till enjoy thee, cheerier ts thou ar ;
For in thy quiet gloom, th' exhausted heart
Is calm, though wretched; hopeless, yet resigned,
While to the wind and waves its sorrows given,
May reach, though loft on earth, the ear of heaven !
PARIS, June 30,
WHILE tlie Aflembly receive on one liand
the congratulatory addrefl'es of various
municipalities, diftritfts, departments, and clubs,
in different parts of the kingdom, on the other
hand, every day brings accounts of officers who
quit ilic regiments, and are retiring into foreign
countries, rather than take the oaths lately pre
fer i bed by the Aflembly. Some of them have
been anefted, but a confulerable number have
cicaped.
What will be the final event of all these trou
bles it is yet too early to foretell. Ihe republi
can party now declare their fentimcnts as pub
licly, and with as little rellraint, as they would
on any Aibjec r tof the greatest indifference. The
History of ( harles I. is in every body's mouth,
and the club called " The Brotherly Society,"
who are a kind of agents to the Jacobins, have
formed a petition to the National Aflembly, (and
by a public advertisement requested thefignature
I of every citizen) the objeisl of which is, without
any disguise, to demand the abolifhinent of mo
narchy,"" and the eftabliihment of a republican
government. They speak of their niajellies un
der the title of late king and lati queen. By the
bve, the word rtint (queen) is effaced from the
French language ; the terin king's wife is substi
tuted in its place,
It is remarkable, that though so much is now
depending upon the conduct of the Aflembly
with vefpetft to the king, no decree or motion
relating diredly to him, took place during the
whole fitting of Tr.efday last.
His niajefty is not at prcfent in the exercise
of any public function.
Apartments for the King had been made rea
dy by the order of M. de Bouille, in the Abbey
of Orval.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, June 29
M. tie Noailles, after having dwelt upon
that grievance in the antient form of govern
ment, which compelled brave soldiers to leave
the country from its refilling to give them rank
if thev were not of noble birth, proposed a de
cree, the object of which was to invite all French
officers dispersed in foreign nations to return to
iheir Country, in order to be promoted to ntili
tary rank, according to their talents and pat
riorifin. The consideration of this decree, the
Aftenibly referred to their Military Committee.
M. de Noailles then proposed a decree to lecnre
upon the civil lift a pension to the officers, sub
altern officers and guards oi the company body
guards fupprefled two days (ince. This decree
;ilfa the Aflenibly ordered to be printed, and ad
journed.

[Whole No. 246.]
M. Dnport then made a report in the name of
the comniitiees of the conrtitution and revision,
on tlie labours of the National Afi'embly.âln a
long speech he enumerated what had aheady
been completed by the Legislative Body, and what
yet remained to be done. He mentioned the
approaching termination of the prefent'Legifla
ture, and the neceility which thence arose, that
the constitution should be fantftioned by the peo-
ple. And in the conclusion, he proposed that
there should be appointed at Paris, 011 the 4th of
August, a Federation General, coinpofed of the
National Guards, and the Mayors of the Muni-i
cipaliries. .
M. Rewbell was of opinion that this idea had
been drawn up in a paper dirtxibuted this morn
ing by M. Bacon, Elector of 1789. in which, af
ter having invited Ik is fellow-citizens to gi v e up
all views of republicanif'm, and to restore the
pilot to the helm, he remarked, that Paris would
lose twenty-five millions, if we had no longer a
Kin<>, and that this capital subsisted only by the
tribute of the Provinces.
M. Buzot took this occasion to demand that
tliey fhonld withdraw the decree, which suspends
Electoral Afl'emblies, which he regarded as calcu
lated to retard their labours. He added, that it
was iinpoflible that, during the harvell, the De
partments (hould fend to Paris their men and their
money, and that every one ought to be allowed
to take their oath to the Constitution into partial
confederation. '
M. D'Andre opposed the reserving of the De
cree which suspends Electoral Diets. Endeavors,
he undcrftood had been carefully set to work to
induce these Aflemblies to form another consti
tuting body. Of consequence, it would be dan
gerous to alTemble the Electors in the present
moment of agitation. What would be the con
sequence of the King's flight could not yet be
known ; we were still ignorant of the prepara-
tions against us ; perhaps war is at our gates ;
and the only meaira of fafety are a general unan
imity of fentitiient. M. D'Andre then demanded
the adjournment of the plan of confederation, in
which M. Duport readily concurred.
M. Camus demanded, that it should be dif
pofedofby the previous question. It has re
course, said he, to adventitious aid, while in
circumflances the moll critical we have poficfled
t'ne national confidence. I may affirm, that we
have merited the admiration of all Europe. The
proposed confederation would be attended with
much expence and bultle ; if the Aflembly Â£&
with wisdom and firmnefs, it is always secure of
the ratification of the nation.
M. pefuieuuiers endeavored to prove, that
this federation was neceflary, in order to accele
rate their labours, and pbtain a still higher (hare
of public favor.
M. feythioti observed, that the nieafure pro
posed was puerile and dangerous. If a Federa
tion is requefleil to deliberate on the Conftiruiion,
it is a ciicumllatice of degradation ; it is not
ainidft the noise of arms that a free people deli
berates ; and a i'mall number of municipal offi
cers cannot pronounce upon the fundamental
laws of the kingdom. This constitution has
been rarified, it is in the hearts of the people.
The Nation will perceive without concern, that
the new Legislature cannot be the
Body, for if they reversed all the two years of
the Constitution, our government would become
the molt detettable of allâic would then be in
reality an anarchy, all would iflceflantly be trou
ble and confufion.
After fon.e formalities, it was decreed, that
there was no room to deliberate on the plan of
Federation, as at present there would be no
room to deliberate on the abrogation of the De
cree which suspends the Ele<ftoral Afiemblies.
LONDON, June 24.
The charities of the late cotmtefs dowager of

Tlie late coantefs of Huntingdon, in the win

In the history of mankind there are but very
few instances to be found, where kings, unfoli
cited and unintimidated, have made a voluntary
surrender of their power. There are many
great sayings of great ai r ts ; but we read of none
that deserves to be preferred in the judgment
and eftitnation of mankind to the late condui. 1 !
of the King of Poland. The form of the new
constitution of Poland, is not merely jfandtioned
by the King ; but diiftated,framed, and falliioned
in the exalted superiority of his own mind, af
fords a new leilon to the world. It fhewsaKing
who knows and reverences his own Itation ; not
a King of Robes and Sceptres, not a King of Di

The age of the Prince of Conde, the leader ef
the anti-revolutionists, is fivsnty. Perhaps he
may think the remnant of his life but a fmallfa
crifice to his principles !
It is to the honor of Great Britain, that flie
knows how to sympathize with the joy, and to
acknowledge the virtue and heroic condudt of
the French nation, without wantonly imitating
their example. Whatever may be said by wrong
headed scholars, whom too much fancy niultipli
ed into much learning has really and actually
made mad, on the one hand ; or by hot-headed
and vulgar desperadoes on the other ; the sensi
ble and moderate part of the nation, the molt
patriotic, judicious, and able part ofthe commu
nity have not concealed, but avowed their con
gratulation with the French people rellored to
the rights of their Francian and Franco-Gallican
ancestors, But while they acknowledge it was
wisdom as well as fortitude to incur hazards in
France, it would be egregious folly, they know
to unhinge the actual government of England,
as there would be many chances against its eve.

Yet is not I'HE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
without a happy and practical influence on this
kingdom, It has been obl'erved of the reforma
tion in religion, that the Proteflants reformed
the manners and the doctrines too ofthe Catho
lics, without makingany impression 011 theirout
ward forms and ceremonies. Jufl so the French
revolution may be expected to operate on mo
norchical governments. Nor Kings, nor com
Lined Lords, nor haugjity Commone s, will here
after dare to commit such a cits of injultice and
oppression as they have done.âPerhaps we may
trace, in some meal'ure, to what has happened
in France, the ease with which the bill for the
trial of libels by juries, that is, the liberty ofthe
press, palled through the House of Commons.
It is in this way that we wish it may operate : as
a gentle alterative, not as a drallic purge.

moie than four millions of livres claimed by the
Duke d'Orleaus. According to this report the

but to compel them to doit, on pain of being dil

" It was also decreed, that the Priests who

NEW-HAVEN, August 24 .
ExtraO of a letter from the Rev. Joseph Lathrop )t f
Weft-Springfield, to the Preftdent of Yale-College '
dated July 18, 1791- ' I
AS I am writing, I beg leave to commu
nicate a little incident, which may perhaps give
some light in the natnral hiflory of birds. A
neighbor of mine, having, occasion to go into the
meeting-house, with some others, late in autumn
afrer the cold weather had commenced, observed
one of those beautiful birds called hnmbirds, perch
ed 011 a nail, in an altitude so natural that he at
fivft imagined it to be alive. With caution he
approached, and laid his hand gently upon it,
and found it ftiff and life ess. While lie ail

" A curiofiry of a different kind, relating to
the human species, 1 will take the liberty to
mention. â A young man in rh is town, fame years
since, was in consequence of bathing in water,
viflted with a peculiar kind of disorder, which
operated by paroxysms. When a fit seized bini,
he would at fir ft fall down ; but in a moment or
two rife, pofielled of an agility far superior to
what was natural. In two or three hours, and
fotnetimes sooner, the fit would pals off and leave
him in his usual (late, and, to appearance, in
health. But what was molt remarkable in liis
cafe, was the state of his mind. While he was
in a fit, he perfectly remembered things which
had occurred in all preceding fits, but nothing
which had happened in the intervals, or in the
time prior to his disorder. In the intervals, ail
his fits and every thing which had palled in them
were totally obliterated ; but he could diftinct'.y
recollect the occurrences of former intervals.
The time of his fits appeared to him in continui
ty, as did also his healthful periodsâwhen one
was present, the other was loll:. It in the time
of a sic, he took up any business, he would drop
it when the fit ceased, without any recollection
of the maiter; and when the fit returned lie
would refunn the business without any idea of
his having difcontinned it. The cafe was the
fame, if lie undertook any tiling in the intervals
of his disorders. In fliort lie seemed to have
two diftiniS minds, which acted by turns inde
pendently of each other. In the (pace 1 think,
of about two y ears, in the ule of a particular
remedy, his fits left him and he was reduced to
a (imp.e consciousness. The remedy, which cu
red him or deprived him of one of his fouls,
have not been able to learn, the family having
K.ft the recipe.

However iritereiting ami important your He
rald is reputed for your happy l'election of lite
rary and political communications, 1 have been
lurprifed at the filenceof our citizens on the zeal
of the Intendant and Wardens to erect a man
lion for the orphanâto shelter thehelplefs tram
the gripe of famine, and to rear up, in virtue,
the tern lie, who otherwise unsupported, might
fly t-o the covert of dilhonor for support; while
the youth, thus preserved and educated, may be
expected to fnine in some mechanic art, acquir
ing fubfillence with honor, iuttead of seeking
precarious support by depredations on the public.
To what a torrent of fcrihbling malignity a
gaintt official characters, we have fubmiued lafl:
winter, and jet no pen has been occupied to be
stow jnft praise on the nobjelt extention of the
foul, which the candid have observed with aclini
ration these few weeks pall. We have seen the
head of the corporation, and a number of respec
table members, fuppliauts for charity and advo
cates for the raiment and education of the desti
tute and expo fed. We have heard holy men co
operating wiih their endeavours, and in the lan
guage of their heart, and in the name of the So
vereign of all Mercies, supplicating the wealthy
to defend and succour the needy and the inno
cent. Their prayers were nor in vain ; and for
the honor of human nature, if any heart was cold
or contracted, it animated and expanded by their
divine eloquence. How delicious the scene to
the pathetic petitioner of an hour. The hand
that gave was inftaneoufly rewarded by the
extatic raptures of the foul.âGracious Benevo
lence, how delicious is thy dranght !â As this fa
t-red function is congenial with tiie foul, 110 won
der the flame (hould be diffufive. This fubjetft
will be resumed to-morrow at the Synagogue,
where, doubtless, we may have an opportunity
to observe a mixed assemblage of men oppofedin
religious tenets, perfectly united in this divine
attribute of God, without which, profellion is
mockery and religion unsubstantial.
BOSTON, August 29.
Extract of a letter from Cape-Francois, daied
August 6, 1791, to the Editors, brought by
Capt. Joseph Hovvlatid, who arrived here on
Friday I ait, in 18 days from the Cape.
" Some of the members of our new j4[femblee
Colonials, have met ac Leogane, near Port-au-
Prince, for the purpose of executing the legilia
rive part of the government of this colony. As
soon as the body is formed, they will fix 011 a
place to bold their feffio.is in future. Whether
they will decide in favor of this place, Port-au-
Prince, Sr. Mark, the Mole or Leogane, is as yet
uncertain.*
" The decree of the National Assembly, re
fpediing the entire freedom of the Mulattoes, is
â¢very ill received in the colony. The provincial
assembly at this place, have written to the King,
the National Assembly, and the people of France,
in different addredes on the subject.âOther bo
dies, of merchants, officers of the volunteers, &c.
&c. have had meetings likewise ; and have vot
ed and resolved similar to the meetings in New-
England, previous to the commencement of the
last war.
" Tliefe portend future disturbances
here ; and the measures already adopted speak
the troubles at no great diitance. The forts in
and about the town are puttingin order. At the
Pacoiet, a fort which commands the entrance in
to the harbour, commiflaries are appointed to
keep an eye upon the garrison Rationed there.
âAt ihe entrance of the town by land, the forts
have been put in order , and others in different
places are not neglected : All tliefe preparations
are making on account of the expetfted arrival
of a considerable fleer, with 5,000 troops from
France, which is looked for daily, and which,
almolt unanimously, the colony are determined
to oppose, (liould they attempt to enforce the de
cree above mentioned ; âand it is certain this is
the errand of the fleet from Bourdeaux, To
prevent their entrance here, a chain is preparing
to put a croft the channel, which will serve at
lealt as a momentary check to their passage, while
the fire from the Pacoiet will do it effectually
1 can fay nothing decifne what else will be done
to prevent the execution of the decrce, which e
â very one is enthufiallically enraged at."

An opit ion has too much prevailed with wo
men who fiickle iheir children, that indulging
iher.ife'ves in the use of fruits and vegetables
has a tendency to gripe their infants, and gene
ratfc wind in their bowels. It would be a good
rule for ihein, on this occasion, to consider, that
011 the prefervarion of their own general good
health, the health and thriftinefs oftheir infants
will materially depend, and that, if I
l ight,.the free and judicious use of ripe fruits
and vegetables are moll likely to procnte these
happy advantages to both, and the suspicion of
their dif.igi eeii'g â¢. ith either is founded in error.
Philadelphia, September 7.
Extratt oj a letter from Bqftw, Augujl 25,
" I have-seen the publication figncd a " real friend to public
credit," it is a judicious calculation, and a truly sentimental per
formance, and may be of Teal fervicc to the people in general.
It is extraordinary that your Quaker City should dash beyond the
Yoikers; however this spirit has certainly railed public funds,
and tended to strengthen the general interest and the government ;
the excess will find its own cure. It *s the opinion of some of
our wife men that our funds will 111 a few months be equal to
the British ; that the operation of the bank, the cncreafing emi
grations, sale of landsâgrowing imports and exports, extending
navigation, &c. See. must *11 greatly contribute to this point.
The navigation of this port has greatly exceeded this year, what
it was the last, it is said nearly forty percent."
Emigrations from England to France, as from tyranny to free
dom, would be a novelty in the hiflory of the worldâand yet,
strange as it may appear, the idea is contemplated by some per
sons in England, as an event not the most distant or improbable.
Oi.e good turn deserves another; it is about a century only, since
Great Britain was the asylum of thousands of Frenchmen, who
fld from the despotism of Louis le grand. At present the emigra
tions from France ate a new thing under the fun, they consist of
refugees from a country, now said to be the most free of any in
Europe.
So many dangers attend the perpetuation of any o'+ice whatever,
by hereditary succession, that the people of America ought to
tremble at the idea of feeing a law puffed, to establish even heredi
tary Bailiffs or Conftabhs ; left, in the course of a few years, those
officers should, like Pharaoh's magicians, convert their wands into
ferpems, and claim the privilege of flinging their fellow-citizens
to death, by hereditary right. Amer. Dai. Adv.
MANUFACTURES.
" In every countrv where perfect freedom is allowed to indi
viduals to follow what budnefs they please, every inequality be
tween the employer and the employed, will eventually find its
natural level, without the regulating efforts of anv man, or any
civil authority." This retniik peculiarly applies to manufac
turers in this country âIt has been insinuated that the eflablifh
m nt of manufa6hires will tertd to make menials of our citizens,
while'hey arc immured in the fa&ories conftru&ed for carrying
on the works.â But let it be remembered, that we are all under
the proteflion ofjuft and equal laws, that every man is free to
chufe what occupation he plcafes, and that our boundless western
territories will forever afford a retreat from domestic imposition,
as they now do from foreign tyranny.
It is highiy probable that much higher wages can be afforded
to manufacturers and artifb, than are ufuaKy paid to those de
scriptions of persons in Europe, particularly in Great Britainâ
lor it is very evident that while the great body of manufacturers
continue poor and dependant, the proprietors amass immense for-
tunes.
The eftablifhmenr of manufa&ures in this country has long been
a v ry defirableeventâThis will afford a neW lourcc of employ
ment for the poor, which will be conflantly increasing ; it will
open a new demand for the productions of agri ulture, and en
creafe the consumption of our raw materials, which are now ex
ported, and fold to foreigners almost upon their own terms. -It
will enlarge the consumption of prov'fions in proportion to the
number of hands which might otherwise be employed in Agricul
ture, and thus furnifh a fteadv market for the lurplus of our fields,
when disappointed by the flourifhing crops, or the caprice of
European countries.
SAY* A CORRESPONDENT,
All circumstances seem to concur to raise our national impor
tance ; but the greatest profpefls may be over-rated, and no doubt
our's will be ;âhowever this has not been the cafe hitherto, for
there have been ten whose calculations have fallen short, to one,
whose anticipations have gone too far. When the whole monied
capital of this country is brought into aÂ£tive circulation, (as it will
be by the establishment of public credit) aided by the bank, mo
ney will be much plenticr with men who have real property ; the
holders of public stock may then put their whole capital into the
funds, and hire money for their neceflary purposes in businessâ
this will enable them to be munh greater stock holders than other
wise they could be.âMany .will be further induced to do this
from a prevailing opinion that money in the funds at 4 per cent,
is preferable to 6 per cent, on loans made to individuals. There
is a uni-erfal desire to hold stock in the public fundsâthis is the
fpiritand sentiment of the present times-âthese circumftanccs
have conduced to raise the value of stock, arid will continue to
raise it, much more than all the foreign speculations. But fo
reign purchases are not to cease bccaufe the flocks are high.â It is
with men of great capitals in Europe as it is here ; they like to
have property in different funds, and in different countriesâthey
juftlv suppose it is a greater security against the contingencies
which happen to men and nations. At this period Europe is con
vulsed, revolutions follow revolutions, monarchies are overturned,
property rendered insecure. America, tho young, has a name
for unexampled profpe&sâ -her progress in raising her credit is
unpareilclled ; the men of great fortunes therefore in Europe, may
wifely placc part of their property in the funds of these States,
that if their old foundations shake, they may have a supporting
hope from the rising empire in the western world.
From a Correspondent in North-Carolina.
In this State there is not such a flow of national ideas, as there
is in the Northern and middle States ; we are over-run with En
glish and Scotch adventurers, fa&ors, and settlers, who engross
the trade and corrupt the morals of the people by their examples;
while our old citizens are too apt to be servile imitators
of the manners and customs of these Europeans, so much lo that
we can't think for ourselves, nor fpiirn the chains with which they
cramp our trade. There are upwards of ten thousand Scots in
one county only. The government as a State is not upon so ref
peftablc a footing as I think it ought to be ; the Governor's salary
is low, nnd all the appointments in the Slate are on the fame scale.
âWe do not fee that form and order in doing public business
which prevails elsewhere, and which is necelfarv to inspire that
decent refpedf for each other which should subsist between rulers
and people. We have no fchoolsânoprovifion is made by law
for the support and encouragement of learning. The last fefiion,
efforts were made by the eastern members to establish a seminary,
but it could not be doneâthe house would not grant more than
Â£50 when 3000 was neceflary. As to business, fincethe eftablifh
mcnt of the new government it is much altered and encreafedâ
the goods brought into the country have been to an immense a
mount, to what were heretofore importedâmoney has grown
scarceâsilver nearly as plenty as paper. The bank system mufl
extend the influence of the general government; it is a wife and
politic mcafure.
llow it happens I will not pretend to fay, but so we think tkc
fdÂ£fc is, that some of the Southern members ot Congress have been
more truly republican in their r peechcs, than the Eastern : There
is one idea however in which the people of this State agree with
the North rn States, and that is refpefting being the carriers of
our own produce to market. It is a general opinion that the
(hipping owned by the citizens of the United States is at this time
fufficient to carry off all our exports. The federal interest v ill
and does encreafc hereânotwithstanding there is too much of a
disposition to depreciate our national charatter and importance,
owing principally to the ioreign influcncc before mentioned.
151
Some pcrfons have expressed an apprehension that the intereflg
or trade and commerce w&uld fuffer,and confcqnently the public
revenue be diminished by fpcculations in the funds; but there is
no jull foundation oHt'di on this head. The commerce of this
country is keeping pace with our otfcer improvements, and mult
on every principle of calculation continue to encreafe. This con
sideration affords the most pleasing reflections on our profpeÂ£tsâ
the increase ot the revenue from the present duties, while it will
enable adminiflration more rapidly to diminish the public debt,
agreeable to the law ena&ed for that purpose,âwill also entirely
preclude the nccellity of any additional burthens on the people.
While the funds arc on the rife, the excess of private capitals will
be attracted towards itâbut this mult neceffaiily be a tcmoorarv
businessâa casual dream diverted from the broad deep channel
of the commerce of our country, " which as it flows, forever wi 11
flow on."

Not two Blanks to a Prize
Subject to a dedu&ion of twelve and a halt per cent.
The public utility of extending this whart, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour or New-Haven; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful situation is not furpafied, if equalled by any ; br
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriet\, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by reaion of the flats, this wharf is net_elTarily extended to the
channel, where ships can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the most extensive and commodious wharf in Amcrica,
the whole extent being about 3~4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime intertft of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all clafTes of peopl â¢, for
the fucrefs of this enterprize, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of ticketsthan any yet published in
Ameriea) induce the managers to believe the tickets will meet wit 1
a speedy sal?.
The drawing will pofitivcly commence at the State-Houfo, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be publiflied, and the prizes
paid on demand, by ihe managers. Thofc prizes not called for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
for the ufc ot the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.
