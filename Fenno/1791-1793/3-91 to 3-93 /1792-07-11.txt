vhile the redundancy of (hipping owned by n

enfion we may give in the course of ten year:

land : and we cannot doubt, thercfoie, that
ball transport thofecommodities and others, fr<
uch of the States as produce them, to those wh
ball create or have already cftabliihed a manuf
uring demand.
Foreign commcrce being limited by the co
â¢ ined value of our impoits and exports any m<
antile capital, which accumulates beyond the si
equifite for those purposes, would want emplo
nent of a commercial uatuie, if the merchant wt
lot able to have tecourfe to manufactures. Tl
s not a mÂ« re speculation in pofnble even's ; b
onfiderable trading houses and otheis of refpedl
>'e (landing, have actually entered into such pu.
utts. Glais-houfes, rope-walks, powder mill,
mn wotks, fUel works, Hitting auj rolling nulls
[rift mills, naileries, sugar refineries, brewerie
nd distilleries, the manufactory of fail cloth, au<
>f woolen, cotton and linnen goods, exhibit a
his moment numerous proofs of the fa6l.
It is too well known to need moie than a ban
illegation of the truth, that our outward boun<
r effels are always completely laden, and thai
10 not on a medium return half full. It will
herefore, increase the profits of the owners o
hips, if the outward cargo can be rendered more
aluable by manufacturing the goods to be export
d. This may be exemplified in regard to whea
md the simple manufacture of fuperfine flour. A
elfel which will,carry ten thousand bufhelsof ih<
ormer, at the price of a dollar per bushel, will b<
aden foi ten thousand doliars ; but the quantity
>f fupeifine flou) (3,000 barrels) which the Unit
effel could iceeive, will amount, at a proportion,
ite price, to the sum of fifteen thousand dollars
The fame quantity of tonnage, filled with bottler,
sorter, distilled fpirirs, fte; 1, cordage, (larch, peat
flies, carriages,cabinct wares, plate, candles, soap,
infeed oil, paper, hats, ihoes, &c, would ri!e tn
much greater value; and of conbquence, the
iwners of the vessels mull be able to purchafc
nore goods lor the rclu-n by which the
c (Tel being fuller, would make a greater sum in
reight back. This circ'umftance is rendered of
he more consequence by realcn of our diflance
rom the greater part of the coufumers of our lur
>l us produee ; and it is obvious that ships will
hen be moil profitable, when the measurement <>1
11 our imports shall be equal to the measurement
ft all our exports. Vtffclft which depart and re
urn fully laden, cannot fail to enrich their owners
No arguments will be to convince the
idicious and reflecting mind, that the employ

raders, is mod certain and cafv, whvie there is

there â  â  cry reason to believe, that those, who, in
the couri : 0 present war, may fall under the
banners country, will prove inferior in
number to those who will be drawn, by the in
fluence of the new duties, from foreign countries,
to the standard of American manufaftuies : and
although the moll ufeful arts are-no compenluiori
f. . the lives of our compatriots, the acquthtion of
a great number of new fcitizens will counterba
lan. ? the political evil rcfulting from such a loss,
so far as it m2y unhappily occur.
It is detrimental to the United States that the
manufactures they consume arc drawn from n -
tions whose citizens pay much greater contribu
tions to their government than our manufacturers,
and conlequently tliat we so far forth are subjeCt
to their taxes, imposts, and excises. In (iitai
Britain, for example, their national taxes are fc
ven times as large as ours, in proportion to the
number of people in the two countries ; and their
poor rates and church rates are each more than
double our whole national contributions. Tin j
monopolies of thofecountriesfajl heavily upon the
conlr.mers, among their citizens; and those, who
purchase their fabrics, bear a part ol th:s burden,
which lies on their inanufattui cs. The commer
cial charges paid by the Englilh Eaik-India com
pany abroad, amount to one million of dollars pei
annum ; the freight and charges in England arc
about two million and two thirds-more, exrlufivr â¢
ly of duties. The company's civil and military
charges would, in two years like the p fen , pay
all the cxpenlcs of our government, a.,d difeharge
our national debt. Tne reftrj&ipns on navigation
and trade in the Eui opcan nations also enhance the
price of raw materials and articles of confum pnon,
required by their manufactures, ali which falls ul
timately upon the people of the United States, so
far as their fabrics are confumtd here. These I
considerations (hould induce our moll (Irenuous
exertions, to dimini(h those indirect burdens, and
at the sains time they l-id out strong piomifesof
a fucce fslul iffuc to our effn <s ,
In taking a view of the affairs of the United
States, and comparing them with the fituat.on of
mod of the great commercial nations of Europe,
the mind is immediately impirli d with the pecu
liarity of their being without tianfmarine colonies.
Though speculative politic i ns have- entertained
doubts in to favdrable ciieefs Horn lu h
pofleffions, taking into view the cxpenlcs of their
improvement, defen c, and government, no ques
tion has been made but that the monopoly of their
red fr
COQtlAtil*
[Whole No. 534.3 *
trade greatly increases the commerce of the na
tions to which they are appurtenant. Of such h\i
advantage the United States do not enjoy the be
nefit ; and this circumliance, and
the pievailing difpoft'ion to restrict their com
merce, the fisheries, the coasting trade, and manu
fadures appear to merit extraordinary attention.
The confederation of manufa&urcs, upwi gene
ral principles, has been, for leveial years, before
the legifiatures as well of the Hates, as of the U
nion. The estimation of their importance to the
landed and national interests appears to have been
yearly heightened by difcudiou and enquiries into
fads. Household manufacture* have acquired
umverfal and decided approbation. To thofc
which are conduced by laboi-faving machinery
and other procefles, by hoifes and oxen, 2nd
which consequently do not require manual opera
tions, noobjeftion has been made. Such of them
as can be carried on by manufa&urers now among
us, by thole who may migrate heither, bv the
wives and thildren of our citizens, and by black
women, old men, and children, have not been con
fidercd as diminilhina the mass of agricultural in
dustry, but as manitcftly promoting it by i.ew and
extensive demands.
â  The piefent difcuflion of the fubjeft will be ter
minated l.y remarking, that although tltis great
fubdivilion of our political economy has been co
pioully and tre. ly treated in every mode, it has
not onlv prcfcrved its original importance in the
nupltc judgment, but has risen in the eftima'ion of
the people in every part of the unionâa -fate that
rarely attends unimpoitant truths or dangerous
enors in an enlightened conn.ry.

occur to those who are entering on
the fair career of public life, that
though indud'ry and talents will not

[The following remarks on Air may not be un
seasonable at'this season of the yearââ -fpeci
allv as many other disadvantages attending
confined, or which is the Tame, unwholesome
air, might be mentioned.]
" IT is now certainly known that
the breathing of a grown Jierfon vi
tiates a gallon of air every minute,
rendering it unfit for respiration. A
number of people, therefore, confin
ed in a finall close apartment, malt
soon fill it with putrid vapor.
" It is a facft, equally well ascer
tained, that noxious vapours arelight
er than pure air, and are therefore
perpetnally endeavoring to ascend.
" The exit of these vapors (hould.
be promoted by every poflible mean
in our power.
" Air, in facft, being the befl vehi
cle for carrying off putrid vapors, it
ought to have as free a passage thro'
all parts of a house as poflible.
" Frequent white-washings with
lime and water would contribute
greatly to purify the vitia'ed air;
and it is evident that cleanliness in
the floors, dress, and every other par
ticular, ought to be attended to as
much as circumstances may permit.THE CONSPIRACY OF .KINGS.

ExtraEl of a letter from a-genthmmti*
Kentucky, to his friend in Somtrfit,
dated Wafbington, Ma fun count},- A
\ pril %oth, 179-2- \
Mr. William Chambers went from
from his store at this place, to the
Falls of Ohio, February 25th, in a
fniall open boat, loaded with flolir,
whiskey, and dry goods, he ha 1 two
men and a boy with him, and two
women and several children went
pafiengcrs. Between the Miamies
and the mouth of Kentucky river, he
was fired upon fioni the Indian fliore
| âthe ImNans whoop'd and followed
him down the river about half a
mile to a fniall creek where they
had tlieir canocs, they got into
thein, eighteen in number, one ca
noe pu.'hed across the river to the
Kentucky Ihore, and the others
pursued the boat, kept up a continu
al (king and yelling as they went.â
Mr. Chambers had two mujkets and
one blunderbuss in the boat ; but
was badly provided with ball, and
was obliged to cut bar lead into slugs
â when the Indians came within fhoc
he returned the fire, which put a ltop
to their whooping, yet pursued and
fired as fall as they could, until they
got within thirty or forty yards of
the boat, Mr. Chambers then fired
the blunderbuss, the noise of which
they seemed not to like, some of them
no doubt felt, very fenfibiy, the con
fluence. They had now pursued
the boat about three miles, tliey then
turned and went back ; the boat's
crew received no damage, except a
flight wound Mr. Chambers received
in one of his fingers. The defence
made by Mr. Chambers, considering
the situation he was in, is thought
here to be the belt ever made 011 the
river
The Indians in cases of this kind
do not fight but under great advan
tages, and then by their hediousyel
lings, so alarm and disconcert the
paflengers, that they frequently fall
an easy prey to their savage barba
rity.

IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE,
By the Olive Branch, Capt. Calder, arrived
xt Boston, and the York pilot-boat, arrived at
New-York, both from London, after Ihort pal
fages, papers are received to the 2d June, they
contain the following interesting information.
In the Bruifel s Gazette of the 4th May is an
account publiflied by the government, âThat
011 29 th April a body of French troops advan
ced near Tournay ; these were attacked by one
regiment and feveu companies of foot and four
squadrons of dragoons, that after the Auftrians
had fired lbme pieces of cannon the French re
treated precipitately beyond the Austrian iron
tiers âwith the lol's of two dragoons, andfeveal
horses killed, forty so dbrs takeu prisoners
and four pieces of artillery. 011 the lide of the
Auftrians none killed, wounded or miffing.
On the fame day another body of French
troops, under the command of Monf. de Biron,
entered the Austrian territory, and advanced
beyond Boulfut, these were opposed by General
Beaulieu at the head of 1830 infantry and 1500
cavalry, and were obliged to retreat towards
Bouifut with the loss of twenty killed and (tve
ral wounded. The day following the French
troops again attacked Gen. Beaulieu, a Ihon
action commenced, which ended in the complete
rout of the French, who loft 250 killed, a con
siderable number taken prisoners, and five pie
ces of cannon.
The above account is under the Bruflbls head.
Under the London head are accounts which
make the above actions to have been more con
siderable ; that in the firft Ikirmilh the French loft
near four hundred men, that, in the lccond
they had 700 killed, and among them Count
Rochambeau's sonâbut the Brulfels account is
no doubt fufficiently exaggerated.
The papers further state, that Col. Dillon,
who commanded the French in the iirft action,
being fufpefted of treachery, was taken by the
soldiery and mob at Lille, and hung upon a gib
betâhis head and legs cut off, and the trunk of
his body burnt. âA French Abbe, fufpefted also
of treachery, parting accidentally by this scene,
was also seized and executed on the spot, the
soldiers also executed their chief engineer, and
two or three other officers. An article under
the Londonderry head fays, that Count Dillon
was, tried by a court martial, that he was
hinged and burned halfalive; the charge agair.it
him was being privy to a scheme of leading the
French troops into an ambuscade, where were
15 pieces of cannon. Col. Dillon's brother has
petitioned the National AlTembly to employ the
molt effectual measures to discover and punish
the aflaflins. Several Ikirmilhes between the
French and Auftrians took place from the 4th
to the 20th May, the date of the last continen
tal accounts; the former are represented as
having been always worlied. A great many of
the French soldiers desert and join the Austrian
army". The 3ruifv.i, Gazette ..ep.efents the
above Ikirmilhes and attempts as nothing more
than ministerial intriguesâthat they (hall soon
fee whether the French army will assume a more
military attitude.âAs to the Austrian troops,
the faini Gazette lays, they fecm remarkably
steady, wel( disciplined, and by no means likely
to desert.
Toe French prisoners at Brufielis amount to ,
about 23c âamong whom is Lt. Col. D'Efter- ]
hazyâthey are treated in the fame manner as (
the Austrian troops. The 'French minister of .
war, M. De Grave, has resigned. The Nation- â 
al AiFembly have voted an address to the peo
ple ; it recommends discipline in very earneit
term? to the soldiers, and concludes with fay
ing, u We have sworn never to capitulate â¢
with pride or tyrannyâWe will keep our oathâ
Deathâdeath, or vi&ory and equality." 'The '
alTeinbly has " ordered, that the executive
power inform the AiFembly, every eight days,
of the enquiries made into the aiFaffination com
mitted at Lifl<*, of Gen. Dillon, and other offi
cers"ânine persons were already in custody on 1
that account. A spy had been apprehended,
who, it was proved, had cried out in the adtion
of Mons, " Save himielf who can.'" The war
minister informed the AiFembly in the fitting of
the 13th May, that the whole regiment de Saxe
had deserted and gone over to the enemyâ92
of them ware brought back and 88 horses.
Three squadrons of the regiment of deÃerchini
have also deserted. May 14 âM. Servan gave
alarming accounts of the number of troops
which continue to desertâhe demanded that a
ievere law be passed to prevent desertion, and
to deterotficersfrom resigning their commissions.
M. lznard concluded a spirited harangue by
moving, having previously aflerted that the
coufttry is in danger, that the Legislature (hould
meet 111 some private place, on the evenings
when there is no fitting ; and that a message
be sent to the King, desiring him to declare
whether he loves or hates the constitution, and
whether he means to support or destroy it.
M. Rochambeau has resigned his command,
and is succeeded by M. D'Eftaing. M.La Fay
ette's army is in theSieighbourbood of Namur,
and is continually reinforcedâhe seems, by
his motions, t fays the BrufFells Gazette, to be
meditating some important attack. The King
of Pruflia has ordered 70,000 men to march, of
which himfelf is to take the command. The
Duke of Brunfwick is to command the Austrian
army in Flandersâthe Prince Hohenloe the
Austrian and HeUian army on the RhineâGen.
Brown is to command under the Duke, in
Flanders.â Thus much for foreign continental
affairsâit is pretty apparent that great allow
ance is to be made in reading the foregoing.
The citizens of the United States have had fuf
ficient experience during their own contest, to,
prevent an implicit credit in foreign news
paper details of battles, sieges, desertions, &rc.
They are more than one half exaggerations.
The accounts from England arcâThat the
Lord Chancellor Thurlow has resignedâThat
frefh riots had broken out in Birmingham, oc
cafioned by a soldier's being killed, and were
jencreafing when the veft'el lailed. Mr. Paine
lias publilhed a third pamphlet intitled the
CrisisâA royal proclamation is iifued agiinll
ieditious writings. Britilh stock has fallen;
3 per cents to 87. American funds at par.
A camp had been formed at Bagfliot, and ano
ther at Hyde Park.
By sundry articles under the head Coblentz,
ill the European papers, dated April 20âit ap
peals that the ex-princes have culled a convoca-
tion of their adherents, uhoie intention is to
declare the King incompetent to the duties of
his stationâand to appoint Monsieur, Regent,
and Couut D'Artois generalilliiuo of the forces..

Til. JEFFERSON, Sec'ry of State.
Philadelphia, Jul) 7, 1792.
The accounts of the affairs of France this
day publilhed, are received through the medium
of Britiih papersâthe public anxiety h greatly
excitedâbut a little re flettion will relieve the
mind from an anticipation of very disagreeable
consequences to the cause of Freedom, when it
is conlidercd that the French Itory is not told
by themselves.
During the late war in America, it was ex
tremely difficult to ascertain fa&s jvhich were
said to have happened within a very short dis
tance ol" the place where accounts were pub
lifhedâln the present cafe, when the rumors
of rumors, and the echoes of echoes, are wafted
across an ocean of a thousand leagues, and the
trumpet of news is blown by those who live by
[fabricating reports, let us be " flow to believe."
Accounts from .Cape Francois to the -65 th
June, fay, that the negroes are flill destroying
with as much fury as ever, and no profpeft of
a peace with them.
Attempts were making by the Governor to
negotiate with the mulattoesat St. Mark's,but
the event was not known.
Captain Joseph Brandt, the celebrated Indian
Chief from Canada, departed a few days since
from this city on a journey to the weltward.â
It is fai I his objedt is to endeavour to concili
ate the minds of the hostile Indians, and lay
the foundation for a permanent peace between
those tribes and the United States.
By a veflel arrived here on Saturday last we
learn, the decree of the National Aiiemhly giv
ing to the free negroes and people of colour equal
rights with the whites is generally approved of
in the colony. The parish of Jeremie, only,
have made (hew of opposition to it.
By this veflel we alio learn, that the negroes
have written to M. de Rouvray, proposing
peace on terms le s rigorous than heretofore.
The vefTel also brings accounts of a declaration
of war between Ruflia and France.
Extrafl oj a Utter jrom Majjachufdts.
u Some late accounts from the westward give
a dawn of hope that peace may eventually be
concluded with thehoftile Indians without much
more war ; i* it can be, it will be fortunate in
many refpe&s. If it were not for some white'
Stages on the frontiers of some slates, I conjec
ture the business might be effe<sledwith whiikey;
and blankets. I wish the good Quakers, or
some other denomination equally pacific, might
always be next neighbors to the Indians, as they
boast of knowing how to live at peace with
them.

lers re-cietfled, and things jog 011 according to
old stile. We are blest with a fine season."

V leading feature in the chara&er of the re

to the English ; no longer influenced by those
unjust prejudices, those mean jealousies, which
formerly divided the two countries, they have
taken every occasion to express, with regard
to the British nation, the highest relpecl and
confidence, and to shew how desirous they are
to cultivate a reciprocal good utiderftanding,
and eftablilh a permanent alliance. Thh sen

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
Stating facts with respect to the Bank of
the United States, has been calledâ u Throw
ing duit in the peoples' eye*but it may with
more propriety be said, that some of" the false
hoods and misrepresentations which have been
th\ Â»wn out on the iubjeft are brick-hat argu
ments, calculated to knock the peoples'eyes
out. The measures of the General Govern -
ment are the result of the 1110 ft labored invefti
! gation, and are founded on experienceâas fuel;
i they will Hand tke left ; but had the vrjiwary
I schemes of many persons been adopted, efpe
ciallv those relating to finance, it is pore
than probable that the hopes of the people, like
the do ve of Noah, would to this day have found
no retting place. And though this o'ofervation
is in part conjectural, yet confidc-ring that the
oppofers of the measures which have received
the lan&ion of the Legislature of the United
States, are generally the fame persons who op
posed the adoption of the new Constitution, and
ere the advocates of committee systems and paper
expedients in the days of our humiliation, the
conjecture appears to be well founded âbut
however this may be, certain it is, that the stric
tures on men and measures which form the long
columns in the National Gazette, are deiigned
to subvert the prelent harmony, peace and hap
piness of the Union. âThis obje<st is, in short,
openly avowedâFor, fay these modest eagle
eyed supervisors of the legiilative and execu
tive departments of the government of the tJ

brought about," that is, That revolution,
which has given birth to the glorious revolutions
in Europe, mud be revolutionized.
"Whoever, fays a correspondent, is acquaint

nations, and their mode of carrying on war,
must be convinced that the pre fen t system of

months, in teaching men to hold one of their
eyes over the button holes of their jacket, a
practice absurdly called u drejjingy" eventually
of no service whatever in the grand aim of all
armies, that of conquering.
Shouting on the day of battle is a practice
founded in nature, the dreadful efFe&s of which
are known only to those who have experienced
them, or are only to be conceived of by those
acquainted with the principles of adlion in the

why should not other founds produce effe<sts that

been practised by the Trojans, by the Geimans,
by the Gauls, by the Grecians, and by the Ma
cedonians and Persians. In many inltances,
recorded by historians, the enemy have fhame
fully fled, upon hearing the shout, before they
were in danger from the pikes of their adver

Of prejudice in wisdom's livery bright :
