txlraÃof a lettttfrom Virginia,
Â« errors and inconveniencies arising
1 from the bankrupt laws in England,
are many, and obvious; nay, they have arilen
to such a lieighth, that Lord Chancellor Thur
lou', at the fittings at Lincoln's Inn, two years
ago, observed, " that fnch were the frauds
aiid perjuries that were daily pra&iled, by
men who availed theradves of these laws, for
the mod nefarious purposes, that, unless they
could be amended, (the bankrupt laws) it
were better that none were in force."âThe
following ir. mostly extracted from Mr. Bur
gess, 11 on the. law of insolvency," a book,
which fliall be forwarded for the perusal of the
Virginia delegationâMr. Izar,D and Mr.
Smith,, of South-Carolina, and Mr. Mercer,
of Maryland, (hould these gentlemen not pos

advocate {or a bankrupt system ; becscfe I
was 1 si i.Md to the furtherance of jufHce^t^
commerce ; but, the author, who is a mem
ber of Parliament, a barrister, was undeivfe
cretary of Hate, and also a commiflioner of
bankruptcy, soon taught me, that in this sys
tem none of these advantages were to be
found : he took from me my delufidn, and
Ihewed me clearly from his reasoning, that
a ly art of this fort in America, unless framed
upon wiser principles than any in Englifnd,
would induce more injurious than beneficial
conferences. " It is a common error (lays
the author) of legislators to frame laws upon
the impulse of the moment. When this hap
pens, original principles are disregarded, and
confluences are not confidered âought we
then to be surprized that inconveniencies en

their houses, and other at c ts of arbitrary pow

bring the bankrupt to"a:i account, aid fatHy
the demands of his creators âSo iiijich for
thele atXs on general grounds. Much is to
be reprehendedi.i other parts.
u The coauniiHoners proceed nrft exparte
and fbcretly, upon the oath of any creditor
who is refolvcd to take out a cor/unison of

fuin of 750T. ârtls is a common prrfticc ;
and all the multiplied laws of England, and
the invention of their mod ingenious jurif
prndifts, have never been able to supply ade
quate remedies, in prevention of tbefe notori

another and another grows -â¢ the hydra-head
of villainy is too pullulating to be crushed by
the vigilance, the dexterity, or the arm of
legislative power or wisdom.

observe, 14 these are evils of the English sys

beacon* to warn us against running on the like
rocks of error : hence we will take care to
guard our Jaws again ft such enormous defers
âwe will free it from the arbitrary princi
ples that deform their codeâwe will make it
suitable to those of our own constitution, and
never compel a man to answer interrogato
ries on oath, by which he may criminate him

ers Ihall be curtailed, and yet they fliall be
all-efficient to answer the end of their crea
tion : the fraudulent confederacy of aflignees

iiijjppMr â  to

such a law. It fttikes me, as a matter of
great difficulty, " to reconcile with the effi
ciency and the energy of the law, the right
of the citizen/' Better in my opinion that
none exilted, unless you can etempt it from
the egregious vices of the Englifli code.âYru
will find it, as Mr. Burgess observes, 11 An

of virtue, the mini fie r of iniquity, and the de
ftruclion of credit and commerce."

cause of liberty in France so popular
lit the Limited States, wpt with (land ing the mali
cious inclullrv employed by those from whom
we aÂ»Â«â  obliged to receive our hiOorv of the re
vohitiop, to delame its leading events and prin
cipal authors.
But vhilc I rcjoice so much to fee the cause
in gen<ral so well received. I cannot but be dis
gusted at the disposition which some of us dis
cover |o ape every particular ci-rcumftance that
attendk.it.
ThiÂ» remark was excited by the use which I
fee made oj the teirn Citizen, in imitation of a
custom introduced into France fmce the last re-
volutin.
Th : s appellation was oroper to be introduced
& cbunjenam ed inthat country,in o-der to make
the people feel more flrorigly the difference be
tween their present elevated rank of citizens, i>nd
their former dteiaded fitU3tion of fubjf&s. It

quality and artificial diftinÂ£tioq ot rank, to seize
with ardor cverv thing held out to them which
pointed out to them the happv change of
fuuation, and the present superiority of their
characters.
In this country, how-wer, we have not felt or
known the inconvenience of a diftinftion of
rar.k or superiority of rights in artv privileged
part of the community : we have no change of
fnuation to mark by a change of political terms ;
we have do antient oppreflion* to render Odi
ous, and 110 deliverance from them to celebrate ;
it is therefore unseasonable and ridiculous to
transfer thiÂ« term from a country where its use
Was fa well judifVed, to one where rio cirenm

with a large body of Creek Indians, at which
were present Kings and Chiefs from tucKty-one
of the principal towns in the Upper a:id Low
er Creeks.
The Indians remained with the Agent three?
weeks, during which time every thing was
conducted with great decorum Many mat
ters of importance to this country were then
arranged, and all business between the Uni
ted States and the Creeks put in an agreeable
train.
It was agreed, at this meeting, that all pri
soners in the Creek land, belonging to the
United States, shall be immediately brought
to the Agent, Indians Commiflioners being
appointed for that purpose. The boundary
line from St. Mary'* to the Alatamaha is now

United States, agreeable to treaty. The

Chiefs who were present did, in behalf of
themselves and the whole of the Creek Nation,
give the most unequivocal airuraucc that tr.ev
would continue in peace and friendfhip with
the United States ; that they would not join
any Nation or Tribe of Indians who are or
may be at war with the United States; thar,
/hould any of their young diforderiy men be so
imprudent as to join any Tribes at war, the
Nation would disown them, ar.d they nnul
share the fate of the hofcle Tribe.
Upon the whole of the bufineflu the Indians
exprelfed a" ardent desire of living in close
friendftiip with this country.
After fettling all matters the Agent c.ave
them a plentiful supply of provisions and clo
thing, also diftribtited among them a quantity
of farming utensils and mechanic tools, which,
together with 5000 bufnels of corn, had been
fentby the Prefideut of the United States
from Philadelphia, for relieving the wants of
those people. The crops of cbrn in tie Na

great many of them will draw supplies from

The inhabitants of" Georgia may refi alTur

O to 4^CONGRESS.
The following was read in the House of
Rxp*esÂ£Ntativis on Moday last.
Trcafury-Dtpattment, Feb. 4, 1793*
SIR,
I HAVE loft no time in preparing, as
far as has been pra&icable, confident
ly with the courfc of facts, the several
statements required by the resolutions of
the House of Representatives of the 23d
of lad month ; and I have concluded to
add to them such further statements as ap
peared to me necessary to convey fully the.
information which is ur.derftood to be the
cbjeft of those resolutions. It was my firft
intention to submit these Statements col
lectively, with such explanatory remarks
as the occasion might demand ; but find
ing on experiment, from the extent and
variety of the mater involved in the reso
lutions, that more time will be riquifite for
a full development of it than I had anti
cipated, considerations of weight in my
mind have determined me to present the
different parts of the fubjeft successively.
Among other advantages incident to this
course of proceeding, will be that of hav
ing it in my power to give a more accu
rate and mature view of the entire fubjeÂ£t,
without too great a dereliction of the cur
rent business of the Department. In exe
cuting the task I propose to myfelf, I
rely on the indulgence of the House
to a latitude of observation, correfpopd
ing with the peculiar circumstances of
the cafe.
The resolutions to wliich I am to an
swer, were not moved without a pretty
copious display of the reasons on which
they were founded. These reasons are be
fore the public, through the channel of
the prefe. They are of a nature to excite
attentionâto beget alarmâto inspire
doubts. Deductions of a very extraordi
nary completion may, without forcing
the sense, be drawn from them.
I feel it incumbent upon me to meet
t'ae suggestions, which have been thrown
out, with decision and explicitnefs. And
while I hope, 1 lhall let fall nothing in
consistent with the cordial and unqualified
refpeft which I feel for the House of Re
prefcntatives,âwhile I acquiesce in the
fufficiency of the motives that induced on
their part the giving a prompt and free
course to the invcftigation proposedâl
cannot but lefolve to treat the fubje& with
a freedom which is due to truth and to
the consciousness of a pure zeal for the
public interest.
I begin with the last of the four resolu
tions ; because it is thÂ»t which seeks in
formation relative to the most delicate and
important of the suggestions that have
been hazarded.
Here however I have to regret the ut
ter impoflibility of a drift compliance
with the terms of the resolution. The
pra&icability of such a compliance would
suppose nothing less than that lince the
feu of December 1792, all the ac
counts of all the CdHe&ors of the Customs
and other officers of the Revenue through
out the whole extent of the United States
could be digested, made up, and forward
ed to the Titafury,â->ould be examined
thete, fettled and carried into the public
books under their proper heads. In a
word, that all the accounts df the reve
nues, receipts and expenditures of this ex
tensive country, could have passed through
a complete exhibition, examination and
adjustment, within the fliort period of
twenty-three days.
It was made (as I presume from the re-*
fult) fatisfa&orily to appear to a Com
mittee of the Konfe of Representatives,
who were charged during the lad fefiion
with framing a direction to the Treasury
for bringing foi ward an annual account of
Receipts and Expenditures, that the
course of public bufmefs would not admit
of the rendering offuch an account in less
than nine months after the expiration of
each year ; in conformity to which idea
their report was formed and an order of
the Hotifc eftablithed.
I need do nothing more, to evince the
impra&icability of an exact compliance
with the resolution in question, than to
observe, that it is even more comprehen
sive (though with less detail) than the or
der of the House "to which I have allud
ed.
To evince nevertheless my readiness to
do all in my power towatds fulfilling the
views of the House, and throwing light
upon the tranfaftjons of the department,
I (hall now offer to their infpe&ion sun
dry statements marked A, AB, B, C, D,
EÂ» F, which contains as far as is at this
time poflible, the information defirÂ«d, â
and with fufficient accuracy to afford fa
tisfa&ion on the points of enquiry involv
ed in the Resolution.
The Statement A, shews in ahftradi
the whole of the Receipts into, and Ex
penditurs from the Treasury, commencing
with the firft of January and ending with
the lad of December 1792, âcorrespond-
ing with the accounts of the Treasurer.
These accounts have been regjplarty Fet
tled lip to the end of September, and co
pies have been laid before the two Houses
of Congress. The account of the quarter
terminating with the year, has not yet
palled through the forms of settlementâ
but is fonder examination, and will, no
doubt, be fettled as it Hands, âthe man
ner of conducting the business and the
usual care and accuracy of the officer con
cerned leaving very little room to appre
hend miftatement or error. A copy of it
is herewith transmitted in the schedule
marked C. gÂ§
This Statement takes up the balance of
the General Account of Receipts and Ex
penditures, to the end of the year -179 1 Â»
as repotted to the House of Representa
tives, within the firft week ofthe present
fefiion, and continuing it down to the end
of 1792, Ihevvs a balance then tn the
Treasury of 783,444 dollars and 5 1 cents.
The Statement B is a .more compre
hensive document. It is k Ac
count of Income and Expenditure. It
(hews not merely the actual Reciptc of
money into the Treasury, but the whole
amount of the National Revenues from
the commencement of the present g#vern
ment to the conclusion of the yea* 1791,
as well out/landing as colle&ed, âthe pro
ceeds of domestic loans, âthe whole a
mount of the sums which have been drawn
into the United States on account of the
proceeds of the foreign loans, *and
all other monies, from whatever source,
which have accrued, within the period
embraced by the statement.
These items form the debit iide of the
account amounting to 1 dol-
lars and 33 cents.
Thecreditfide conlilts of two items.First,
the whole amount of the actual expendi
tures to the end of the year 1791, as dat
ed in the General Account of Receipts
and Expenditures before referred to. Se
cond, the whole amount of the actual ex
penditures during the year 179Â®, as fpe
cified generally in the ftatemeat A, and
particularly in the several quarterly ac
counts of the Treasurer, amounting to
14,765, iaÃ dollars and 83 cents.
The balance of the Account of Incotne
and Expenditure is consequently 5,114-
696 dotlars and 50 cents ; which corre
sponds with the Excess of the Public In
come (including the proceeds ofloans fo
reign and domestic) beyond the a&ual
Expenditure, or more properly speaking,
Di/iurfement to the end of the year 179Â»Â»
This of coutfe is exclusive of thafe parts
of the proceedis of foreign loani y/hich
have been left in Europe to be ,applied
there ; the amount, application and ba
lance are exhihited, as far as they are yet
known at tbe Statement
No. 1, of my late report on foreign loans.
. This Balance, as noted in the State
ment B, is composed of the following par
ticulars :
I. Calh in the Treafury,per Dollars,
{latement A. 785444 .51
11. Calh in the Bank of the Uni

and Baltimore, not yet passed to
the account of the Treasurer, per
statement A, B.
111. Proceeds of Amsterdam bills
remaining in depolit in the Bank ,
of North America, including the
fumof 156,595 dollars and 56, cts.
advanced by the Bank without in-1 '

the year 1792, on account of the
duties on imports, and falling due
between that time and May 1794,
per abftraa E, 2442069 15
VII. Uncolle&ed residue of du- '
ties on spirits distilled within the
United States, per abftra<st F,
This aggregate fomewliat exceeds the
balance of the account ; but in cafe wbere
estimates mull necessarily supply the defi
290
cieney of ascertained results, differences
ef this nature are of course. It is at the
fame time fatisfattory to observe, that the
efti mates which have been heretofore com
municated are proved by the official docu
ments already received, to have been el
fentially correct.
It will no doubt readily occur to the
House that a very small part of the excess,
which has been stated, is a real futplus of
income. There remain to be fatislied ob
fe&s of Expenditure charged, upon the
fund by the appropriations which have
been made, that cannot fail ultimately to
exhautt it probably within four or five
hundred thousand dollars ; which will be
embraced in the appropriations for the
service of the year 1793. A further ex
planation on this point is reserved for fu
ture communication.
A due comprehension of the statements
now presented, mud obviate every idea of
a balance unaccounted for ; in whatever
sense the allegation may have been intend
ed to be made.
If there was before any obfeurity on
the fubjedt, it was cettainly not the fault
of this Department. Till the last reflati
ons, no call has been made upon it, which
rendered it proper to exhibit a general
view of the public monies and funds, âor
to (hew the amount and situation of such
as were unapplied. Particular calls for par
ticular objects were made which as I con
ceive were complied with ; but they were
not comprehensive enough to embrace a
difclofuit of that nature.
It could not theiefore with propriety
have been alledged that there was a ba
lance unaccounted for. To infer it fron.
documents, which contained only a part
of the necessary information, was not juf
tifiable, nor could it otherwise happen,
than that conclusions wholly erroneous
would be the consequences of taking such
imperfect data for guides.
It may be of use by way of elucidation,
to point out some of the tnoft palpable
features of the errors which has been en
tertained.
The following Items are dated as the
balls of the supposed deficiency :
Residue of the proceeds of the Fo
r eign bills supposed to be unapplied
[after deducing the sums furnifhed
for St. Domingo, and the amount of
the debt to Foreign officers]
Surplus of Sinking Fund, meaning,
that part of the surplus of the revenue
to the end of the year 1790, which
had not been applied in purchases
Surplus of the revenue of the year
1791, as reported
Dollars 4345575
Dedu<3 in Bank, meaning, I pre
sume, the balance of the trcalurer's
cash account,
It appears in the fit ft place to have been
overlooked! that in Statement No. 3, of
my late report concerning foreign loans,
mention is made, that on the 3d of Janu
ary there remained to be received of the
proceeds of the foreign bills 633,131 dol
lars and two cents; consequently that
sum could not be confldeted aÂ« in the
Treasury, and ought to be deduced
from the supposed deficiency.
Among the official papers which it iÂ»
intimated were consulted, was an original
account, rendered by the Bank of the
United States, of the falesof Amsterdam
Bills, (hewing a sum of 605,883 dollars
and'B cents, as having been received by
the Bank and two of its Offices of Dis
count and Depolit, for the proceeds of
Ihofe Bills. Had that document beer, un
derstood, it would have been known, that
this sum was in Bank over and above the
Balance of the Treasurer's Cash Account;
and this also would have served to ac
count for a large part of the supposed de
ficiency ; namely 605,883 dollars and 8
cents. The course of this tranfa&ion will
be hereafter explained.
605883 o8
But among the misconceptions which
have obtained, what telatesto the surplus
of Revenue for the year 1792, is not the
least striking. Thelcmis inform (andcon
fequently no information on that point
from this Department could have been
necelTary) that credits are allowed upon
the duties on Imports, of four, fix, nine,
twelve months, and in some cases of two
years. Reason dictateÂ«, that a surplus in
such cafe, mull be considered as poltpon
ed in the Collection or Receipt, till all the
appropriations upon the fund have been
firft fatisfied. The account of Receipts
and Expenditures for the year 1791, in
pofleflion of the House, shews that at that
time, no less a sum than 1,828,289 dol
17799 s 80
341057 19
Dollars j 110897 00
Balaacc unaccounted for
lars and *8 cents of the anticeduft
were outtlanding in Bonds. How th cn
could it have happened, that the f urp l U!
of 1792, was fought for in the 1 , ea f Ury
at the very infant of the expiration of t&
year ? I forbear to attempt to rrace ihÂ«
fourceof a mistake To extraordinary.
Let me however add, that of the Sut.
plus in queftioh, 172,584 dollars and 8:
cents, ate not payable till April and May
1794, as will be seen by the A hit raft Â£.
Thus have I not only furntfhed a jult
and affirmatiVtf"*iew of the realisation
of the PublTc Account, but have liltewifc
shewn, 1 trust in a conspicuous 'manner,
fallacies enough in the Statement, front
which the inference ot an unaccounted for
balance is drawn, to evince that it is one
tilTue of error. In this, I might have gont
still further, there being scarcely a ftepoi
the whole process, which is not liable to
the imputation of mifapprehenfton. Bat
I wi(h not unnecessarily to weary the pa.
tience of the House,
Another circumstance to which im.
portance has been given, and which Â»ai
noticed in connection with the suggestion
last difcqfled, is a disagreement between
a Memorandum in the Treafufer's Bank
Book and the Statement reported by me,
of the amount of Bills drawn at the Trea.
fury upon the Foreign Fund. Such a dis
agreement no doubt exists, and to the ex
tent of 5,760,138 florins or guildersâ
But the following circumstances con
tain the solution of tjjis di&mistiDg ap
pearance.
There will he found in the Statement
A, two several credits; each for
2,000,000 dollars, as for monies received
into the Treasury, with correfpondino
Debits of equal sums as for monies paid
out of the Treasury.
But neithei the one t)or the other did
in reality take place. The whole is a
mere operation, to accomplish the purpo-
Fes of the Xlth feftion of the ast to incor
porate the fubferibers to the Bank of the
United States } without an inconvenient
and unneceflary displacement of< funds.
That Section authorizes a subscription
to the stock of the Bank, on account of
the Government, not exceeding in a
mount two millions of dollars, and pro
vides for the payment of it out of the mo
nies which (hould be borrowed by virtue
of either of the acts of the 4th and nth
of August 1790, the firft making provisi
on for the public Debt, the la ft for reduc.
1668190
400000
ing it ; enjoining at the fame time, that a
Loan should be made of the Bank to an
equal amount, to replace the monies
which were to be applied to the payment
of the fubfeription.
It is evident, that nothing could have
been more useless (at the fame time that
it would have been attended with obvious
disadvantages to the government) than
actually to draw from Europe, out of thÂ«
monies borrowed there, the sum necessary
for the payment of the Subscription to
the Batik, and again to remit out of the
Loan which was to be obtained of the
Bank a fufficient sum to replace those mo
nies or such part of them as may have
been dellined for the foreign dbjeft. Loss
upon exchange in consequence of over
(locking of the market with Bills.âLoss
in iÂ«vtercft by the <Jelayfr incident to (!Â«:<*
peration ; and which would necessarily
have suspended the ufeful employment ot
the fund for a considerable time. These
are some of the disadvantages to the Go
vernment. To the Bank alone could any
benefit have acctued ; which would have
been in proportion to the delay in re 'tÂ° r '
ing or applying the fund to its primitive
destination. Such an operation therefore
could only have been juftified by an io
difpofition on the part of the Bank to fa
cilitate the principal object, without the
intervention of actual payment.
But no such disposition existed. On
this, as on every other occlfion, a temper
liberal towards the Government has cha
rafterifed the condudt of the Directors o
that institution.
It was accordingly proposed by rn f i
and agreed to by them, that the objev to
be accomplished should be carried ,ntc
effect by a merely formal arrangement.
In this however it was neoefiary to cos'
fult the injunctions of law, and the P rin "
ciples of the constitution of the Trea ur J
Department. ,
These points then were to be eiiettea
a payment of the Subscription money, ,c
veil the Government with the property
of the Stock,âpossession of the means ol
paying it, which were to be derived row
the foreign fund, and ofcourfe were
to be in the Tieafury before payment
Â»7738*

15J4933Cbitld .be made,âthe replacing what
fhouid be taken from that fund, by a loan
of the Bank.
The following plan for these purposes
was devised and executed, by previous
conceitâ â¢
The Treasurer drew bills upon the
Commifiioners in Amsterdam forthe sums
Tequifite to complete the payment on ac
count of the subscription : These bills
were purchased by the Bank, and war
rants in favour of the Treasurer upon the
Bank served to place ii\e proceeds in the
Treasury. Warrants afterwards iffijed
upon the Treasurer, in favour, of the Bank
for the amount of the subscription money
which was receipted for on the part of the
Bailk, as paid. Other warrants then is
sued in favour of the Treasurer upon the
Bank, for equal sums, as upon account of
a Loan to the Government; which war
rants were fatisfied by a re-delivery to the
Treasurer of the bills that had been drawn
Upon the Commifiioners- In the last place,
wai rants were drawn upon the Treasurer,
to replace the monies supposed by the ar
rangement to be drawn from the foreign
fund, which perfedted the opeiation. But
from the detail, whicrÂ« has been given, it
will be seen that in faÃ no monies were ei
ther withdrawn from or returned to that
fund. The bills were cancelled, annexed
to the Warrants, and are lodged in the
Treasury as vouchers of the tranfaftiop.
These bills were for two separate sums
each 3.4.7 TiQQQ Guilders, equal to a mil
lion of Dollars ; the payment having
been divided into two parts, upon certain
equitable considerations, relative to the
dividend cf the firft half year.
This tranfa&ion explains 4,950,000
Guilders, of thefum which forms the dis
agreement between the memoiandum in
the Tieafurets Bank Book and the State
ment reported by me.
The residue is thus explained. The
sum of 1,237,500 Guilders, dire&ed to
i>e drawn for, on the 30th of November,
was direiled to be coinprifed in one or
more bills, as the Bank (hould desire. It
was at fit It placed in one bill; but this
bill was.afterwards returned, with a re
quell tha it might be converted into smal
ler sums. The Bill returned was cancel
led ; and in lieu of it, there had been fur
nifhed prior to the tirll of Jauuaty of the
present years 934..5&oGuildcis, âthe bal
ance hc.> - fat
pifhed. The sum of 934,500 Guilders
consequently ajjpeiued twice in the Me
morandum.
These two sums of 4,590,000 and
934,500 Guilders, exceed the difference
inqueftionby 124,362 Guilders.
The Trcafurer informs me, that .there
are two bills not included in the memo
randum ; one for 113,750 and the other
for 612 Guilders ; which make up the n
bove-mentioned excess. The former of
these two bills was furnifhed to the Secre
tary of State foi the purpose contemplat
ed by the 3d feftion of the Ast of the
]Â»ft session, entitled, " An Ast making
certain appropiiations therein fpecified."
Is it not truly matter of regret, that so
formal an explanation on such a point,
Should have been made requisite ? Could
no personal enquiry of either of the offi
cers concerned, have fuperfsded the neoef
lity of publicly calling the attention of
the House of Representatives to an ap
pearance, in tiuth, so little fignifiennt ?
Was it seriously fuppofeable that there
conld be any real difficulty in explaining
that appearance, when the very disclosure
of it proceeded from a voluntary ast of
the Head of this Department ?

Mr. Greenup'-s refutation for placing on the
pension lift all such officers and privates of the
militia as are or may be wounded in the service
and who are not provided for by law, âwas ta
ken up in committee of the wholeâMr. Dayton
in the chair. The resolution was read by the
Chairman.
Mr. Greenup supported this resolution.by ob
serving, that as the militia was now called into
service by thÂ« General Government, it was tea*
fonable to make provision for such as may be
wounded or disabledâ-Except this was done, he
conceived that the United States would find it ,
extremely difficult to procure an effe&ive militia
force on any occasion : indeed, it was to be im
puted to this cause that the militia had hitherto
discovered so great a backwardness in turning
out; and that those who had been in service were
so indifferent, being principally substitutes He
added some remarks on the justice and good po
licy of making the provisionâNor did he con
ceive that the encreafe of the pension lift was a
Sufficient reason to prevent making that provi- j
fion, when it is considered how important a sub- ,
je& is a competent defence to our frontiers.
Several gentlemen objeAed to the resolution
as involving a very great and encreafing expence.
The enereafe of the pension lift, it was laid,
ought not to be thought lightly of in a republi
can government. It was said that in the militia
law the obje& of the resolution was in a great
measure provided for; it does not indeed look
back; but provision for particular persons may
be made without going to an unlimited retrof
pe&ive view of the cafe. The resolution was
modified to refer to such officers, non-commif- .
stoned officers and privates of the militia as have
been wounded or difebled since the day
of y or who hereafter fete
wounded or disabled in the the! United
States.
The debate was continued to a cdnfjdersble
length, in which the difference between the
litia and the regular troops was ftatedâTha
latter, it was said, abandon every other pursuit
and business when they engage in the service;
and in cases of wounds and disabilities incurred
| in the public Service j are left absolutely without
J any other resource than the provision made for
; them by the public as pensioners. With refpeil
to the militia, they are commonly persons of
property, who leave their refpe&ivc occupations
for a time, and >*hen the service is performed,
they have their farms and their various occupa
tions to return to. It was said that it would be
unspeakably better to pay the militia at an en
hanced rate, such a rate as may be Sufficient tp
induce them to turn out. That extending the
system of pensions in the manner contemplated,
would render the business complex, extensive and
enormously expensiveâwhile at the fame time,
it would fubjedt the public to innumerable im
positions.
A motion was.made that the committee should,
rife, and that the resolution fhonld be referred to
the committee which reported the bill providing
half pay to the widows and orphans of the offi
cers of the regular troops. After further debale,
this motion was put and negatived.
The qucftion on agreeing to the resolution,
as modified, was then put and agreed to.
Mr. Barnwell moved an additional resolution,
which was agreed to; the purport of which was,
to regulate the mode of ascertaining the nature
and degree of the disabilities, and the annual
allowance to be granted for the fame. , ,
The committee then rose and reported-the
two resolutions to the House. The House a
d opted the refutationsâand referred td a iele&
comrrittee, with inftru<ftions to report a bill.

" Your observations of the French, agree
with my own ; if they fettle a proper form of
government they may be an happy peopleâ
but if a democratic republican form only, fub
jeft to mibocracyâ they may curie the revolu.
tion ; however, I hope good fenle will pre
vail, and that they will have a government of
laws, conlifting of personal-liberty and fecu.
rity of property.
44 I am pleased at their success in the Ne
therlands, Germany and Savoy.âThe despots
v of Europe deserve no better ; I fufpedt the
common people are ready to be conquered
wherever they go, it being the cause of li
berty and equality.
*' We are here truly what fubjetts oujht
.0 beâvery happy, and have every thing
plentyâa season of chearf'ul hilarity has en
sued lincc the holidays, and a constant round
of good eating, drinking, and tnirth, has been
our winter's amusementâwe are fatisfied
with our rulers, and are confident Congress
will do all for the best."
