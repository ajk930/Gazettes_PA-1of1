SAC R&D SCRIPTURES
Of the OLD and NEW TESTAMENTS, with the
Apocrypha,

Paper.
THE great importance ot the Holy Scriptures,
inttreftirtg to every individual ; the divine excel
lence of its doctrines and precepts, and the beauty
and fublimiiy of its paffiges, have so long made it
a capita) opj<*Â£Vof aucution. e* to preCi'ijcU ucca
fion of unity for eulogium.
The piety or enierprize of individuals has pre
fcuied thi invaluable book to tne public in a va- 1
riety ol forms ; in fomfc editions it has been highly ,
ctnhellilhed with superb engravings, which have
greatly enhanced its price ; in others it has been
a&ompanied with voluminous commentaries,
which ncceilarily encreafed the size; while a va
riety of plain cheap copies have gen rally ditfufed
the knowledge of the Scripture, and made the
purefcafeeafy to every class.
Without w.iV-mg m the fmal'ieft degrr* to leffin
the merits of the various editions, whither ptain
or ornamented, which the public are already in
pofle&on of, it is pertinent to it-mark, that very
many readers of taste and judgment have expreifed
a wish for a Familv Bible unencumberrd with ad

edition on a beautiful, new type, superior in size
and elegante to any bible that has yet been printed
in the Englilh language, and which, leaving the
adventitious circumstances ot ornament or com

Mr. Fenno,
Having been favored with the rough copy of the inclosed
Charge, delivered by Judge Sinmcrson,/o
the Grand Jury, at the lafl Court of Quarter
Sefliofu in the County of Salem, New- JerfeyâJ have
sent it to you. for publication, fhculd you think the
fertments contained in it worth) a plate in \out
ufefulpuper. A ibek.
Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,
WHILST the greater part of mankind are
labouring under the prefTure of despotic
.Jvernnjents, it is the peculiar felicity of Ame-I
i cans to live unHer eftahlifliments wiich have'
| torthe;y bafts the voice of the people, and for.
object, tlie public welfare where the genius j
,of the laws is mild and beneficial, and which!
pOiTefs one of the best inflritutions ever yet de
v tied for bringing offenders to. J tift ice,.without
endangering the security of the innocent.
A Grand Jury, composed of the moil diforeet
aÂ«id refpeftabie citizens taken at stated periock
i om the body of a country, in order to enquire
ntoand prefect the offenders against the laws,
an institution admirably calculated to pro
mote 6refer and good government. It is an in
stitution which, from the nature of the appoint
ment, mud poiTefs the best knowledge of the
peoples' behaviour, whilifc it is bound by the
fan&ious of pivil and religious obligation dili
gently and impartially to discharge its duty.
In the diftrihntion of the functions of criminal
- dtniniftration in our government, a most im
portant part of that gi cat duty has been afilgned
to you., gentlemen. To you has been exclu
fiyely committed the duty of crimiuating the
offenders against the laws, and of impeaching
tbcm at the fear of public justice. you, in
ched, it may be laid, has in a great measure
been committed the peace of the country, and
the custody of the public morals.âln vain will
the civil niagiftrate-bind over or commit for
offences, unless those offences are by you enquir
ed into and prelented. And ior vain fliall we
look for public order or private happiness," na
jt.i >Â»&! prosperity or individual fafety, under the
imft perfect conftitutiofis, the bell governments,
and the wisest laws, unlets they are carefully
ai)d uprightly admintftered, and generally re-
and obeyed by the feopJe.-r-Virtuou*
citizens will regard the laws with attention,
and obey them from a fente of duty; but the
fear of disgrace and puni/hment only, can com
pel those of an opposite character to refpe<ft
them-
B. STODDERT.
Hence it is neceflary for the welfare of so
ciety, effectual protection of Its mem
bers in the peaceable enjoyment of their rights,
that offenders lhould be brought to justice : and
however painful the performance of this duty
may be to the feelings of human nature, yet
when it is considered as being inseparably con
nected with fQcial peace the per
form an ce becomes an indifpcnfiblc duty. For
there is no truth more clearly established by ex
"perience than this-âthat crimes and misdemean
ors will multiply in a state in proportion to the
chance of impunity. And whenever it fhrtll
happen that Grand Jurors, ceaHng to be the vi
gilant censers of tfie behaviour of the citizens,
and. regardless of the obligations of duty* fhali j
negledt or refufe to present the offenders againil,
the laws, this admirable institution, the boast of
political wisdom and the pride of Americans,
uiftead of answering the valuable ends for which
it was defigncd. wiil-bqcorne acorn under which
the unprincipled and villainous part of mankind
may disturb the order and peace of society, and
commit depredations on the rights of their fel- j
low citizens with perfeCt security.
It being then necessary that examples should
be made of offenders, in order to deterÂ«others
from the cojnmilfion of crime' â to the end that
such examples may be ufeful, it is ellential that
ail proceedings against persons accused or fuf
pefted, fiiould be attended with the reflection,
that they may be innocent, and that and dil
paflionate enquiry should ever precede the rigors
which justice exaCts, and which are the una
voidable consequences of conviction. Warm,
partial, and precipitate prosecutions, are a dis
grace to any adminiltration; and they never
[fail to excite in the public mind partiality and
companion for the accused, and disgust at the
leverity of government But, on the contrary,
when the proceedings against offenders are tem
perate and decent; when convictions are the
result of impartial trials, held in a
fiftent with the dignity of public justice, the vir
tuous feelings of men will ever be found on the
iide of government; and however they may
commijlerate the unhappy lot of fuffering offen
i ders, their companion will ever be mixed with
| a due degree of indignation.
Happy, thrice happy Americans ! your's is a
government of lawsâlaws made by your own
consent, expressed by your representatives in
the legillature.âLaws which never abridge the
natural rights of man, but in order to enlarge
and more effe&ually to secure the civil rights
of the citizenâand prote&ed by which every
orderly member of society may rejl in per fedftcu?
rity under his own vine and under his own Jig tret, and
none Jhall be found to make him ast aid* And howe
ver some may complain of the inequality of con
ditions resulting from the laws of property ; it
September 25, 1792.
[Whole No. 559.]
is plain that without I iws to regulate : t, pro
perty cairaot exist atyd the world mtift become
an uncultivated common. And it is evident
from the conducl Â«f tbe pooreli member of so
ciety, that-lie values the bleilings rel'ulting from
social order ami cultivated humanity, tar, far,
beyond thole which are to be found amongst the
lawless and lintored lavages of the wilijernefs.
But gentlemen it is never to be forgotten
that public and private virtue are thefole found
ations upon which a government like ours can
reft with fecnrity, and that its duration can on
ly be commeufurate with the prevalence of
those virtues- And in order to cultivate and
cheriih thele vita) principle of freedom, let
each individual constantly bear in mind, that he
is one of the links which conneftsthegrA.it
chain of a social' community, and that he has
duties of a public as well as of a private nature
afligned to him, for the faithful performace of
which he stands accountable to God and )iis
j country. And that between tbe duties of such
as fill the variod", departments of public admi
nistration, and of thoie who tread tbe private
walks of life, there are relations and cpnneftj
ons which never can be J'afcly mfto! ved, and
that performance of ti em mutually aid and
are aided by each other. Let him remember,
that the laws are the ligaments of focietyâtbe
ties-which connect mankind together in their
focln capacityâthe rules which the people
themfelvc? |ui v e cftablilhed for tie regulation
ot their civil citnduft;âthat courts of justice
are the organs by which tiie laws Â»re adraini
fiered, and that the executive magistrates are .
the instruments, to whom the people themselves
have Committed the duty of carrying into ef
feihial execution the decrees of thoe courts of.
justice. And efpecislly let each individual re
member, that in a republic like ours; in order
to give authority to the laws, energy to the
public ariÂ» andrfignity to freedom, it is eflen
tiaj that the public count;nanee and support,
whenever it may be necessary, Ihoukt attend
the civil magiflrate in the lawtfll execution of
liis dntv. And that on the contrary to behold
amontft a free people, the open and repeated
tranfgrefflons of their own laws, without notice
or ceni'ure, to behold the civil magistrate refifi
ed and insulted, vainly calling on the people to
aid him in the execution of laws, is a melancbol
ly fpeftacle of ignorance dp piavity, i:
requires llDT"tht gift of prnphÂ«*y to
that without more knowledge and more virtue,
such a people cannot long remain free â  or in
the language of Montesquieu, " wilen in a po
pular government the laws are suspended, as
this only can happen from the corruption of the
republic, the state is certainly undone."
Most of you having served as grand jurQrs,
ar.d being consequently acquainted with the du
ties of your office, renders it unneceflary for
me to minutely enter into pxrtlcu ar
me only generally to observe that all capital
crimes what foe ver, as well as those of an infe
rior nature, such as mifprifions, contempt, oif
turbances of the peace, nui/ances, and all other
offences of a public evil example again ft the
common law, may be inditfed ; and it seems to
be a general ground, that Wherever a statute
commands any matter to be done, as the repair
of highways and bridge- ; or prdhibits any
thing as an offence aga'tnft the public order, os
conomy or morals, as gambling, horse racing,
tippling and other disorderly houles, whether
licensed or notâl fay it seems to be a general
ground that an offender such statute,
may be indi&ed for his contempt of the law.

OBsrt v at ions on the Letters of " A Farms*,''
Addtejjed to the Yeomanry of tie United Statu.
/(CONCLUDED.)
IN regard #o the funding system, the Hate of
the matter is briefly this. Immediately before
the adoption of the federal conilitution, the
United States were jointly or feveraliy indebted
to their creditors in the amount of about 74
millions of dollars. Qf this sum twelve mil
lions were foreign debt, principally due to or
guaranteed by France. One of the onjedfo of
the funding system was, to discharge this debt
by new loans, upon an interest not less favora
ble, and if pollibie, more advantageous. " ThÂ£
FaÃ.mer" appears to be too friend to
the emancipation of France, to disapprove cf
this grateful, just and honorable part of the
funding system, which, however, has been over
looked by him and others, in their riiflertatiÂ®ns
againfl it. The domestic debt, which amount
ed to 62,000,000 dollars, in principal and inter
est, including the assumed debt, was at an in
terest; of about fix and one ninth per centum,
which on 42,000,000 of the principal of the fe
deral and afTumed debts, gives the sum cf
2,566,000 dollars. As the resources of the
country were not adequate to the discharge of
the interest, being about twenty millions ot dol
lars, it was plain, that public credit could net
be restored but by loans to pay off that interest,
which, if effected at the lov/eft rate of those
made in Europe (four pÂ»r cent.) with the cus
tomary charges, would add 800,000 dollars to
the interest, and would increase the public bur
-1 dens to the annual sum of 3^3^i ooo^Â°^ars )
, clufive of the foreign debt. No other moQe
1 was left, but to reduce the capital, either ail<^*

the neglect of the States to pay the intereit, o
their refufal to enable the old confederation ti
do it, before the eftabliftiment of the prefen

predated the debt by such omiflions and reiuials

profits, nor would they ever he exited. Ihe

Inviolable, the original creditor would not hay.
had cause to complain, nor would the purchase
have h id ail opportunity to peculate in the pro
pe: tv of tie soldier, the widow, the orphan
and the patriotic lender in the hour of publi
need. Tliefe are solid, unqueltionable truths
and will not be denied, nor can they be difpro
ved. The genoral government, on account o
an honest performance of old contrasts, ough
not be charged with consequences which ar
only afcribable to the want of justice, or th
want ftf ability, or the want of order and fyl
teifc it the State governments, during the tim
of the confederation. The difficult part, a juj
provision, has been executed bv the existing na
tional government, and it is entitled to all th<
merit of being an efficient instrument of publi
justice, nonor and prosperity. The impartia
foreign world consider the conduct of the fede
ral legislature in this honorable light at the p e
sent moment.
In regard to the eftabliftiment of banks, i
that were<ci crime or a public injury, it inigh
b? fairly asked who set the example ? The flat
of which Â« The Farmer," from the place o
publication, is presumed to be a citizen. Thi
power of ifluing paper was unlimited in the char
ter granted by that State, but is careful];
guarded "by the ast of Congress establishing thi
bank of the United States. Other State legif
latures have been guilty Â«f the crime of efta
bliftiing bauks. But it is become too plain tha
Congress may not do, without censure, the sam
things, which are unnoticed or applauded whei
done by a State. With refpeft to the opportu
nity, which u The Farmer" alled2;es is givei
to a few men to acquire what he calls llgppid
fortunes, it is impossible to give rational an
fwer.to it, because it is not poflible to afcertai
his meaning. His presumptive meaning reft
upon the fame principle as his ideas about th
pubile debt, and, on a lair cftimate and sum
ming up of the account, would really amount ti
this, that feeing that former meafure c , or ne
glefts, or disorders in the States, or in the oli
confederation had occafioncd a depreciation o
the public fccurities, or certificates, tind fevera
other large portions or descriptions of property
the genera), government ought tobeheidrel
ponfible for all the past evils resulting from fuc
injuries to the original owners of those proper
ties, if they should by wife and honest measure
restore them to their uatural and proper value
though such restoration ftiould not cost the peo
pie of tie United States one dollar more tha
their old government had solemnly promised ii
their behalf to pay.
The last charge in u The Farmer's" im
peachment is, that the United States have ena<sl
ed an excise law, which provides for the col
lection M* aiower excise (by near two-pence per
gallon) from the people of Pennsylvania than
they Weil obliged to pay by a law of their own
State when the federal constitution Was adopt
ed, and at the very moment when the ast of
Congress waspafted. It may be fairly asked in
regard to 4< The Farmer" did he ever petition
the legislature of Pennsylvania to repeal their
excise ast laying the above higher duty, or (if
he has ever been a member of the legislature of
the Stat") M-iiv tie r.ot move in his plate for

THE new constitution, the termi
nation of which we have long
apprehended, is at length at an end.
On Sunday night, the Rullian Mi
nilter delivered the final answer of
h.is Imperial Miflrefs, to the King, in
which (he declares her determination
of re-eltablilhing the ancient conftt

moft of her power, the confederation
of Targo vii z.
The rapid advance of the Ruffian
troops, and the determined language
of her'lmperial Majesty, left King
Stanislaus no alternaiive ; he, there

fcnibled the nobles, commuijicated
to them the Empress's determinati

ed, to prevent the further effufions of
blood and difineinberment of the
kingdom, to submit to a temporary iu
cono-iiitncs, to revoke the conltitution
fettled on the 3d of May, 179 1 . to re "

and to submit the arbitration of the

Sapicha, MarfhaJ of LithuaniaâM.
Potocki, jun.âand M. Soltick, were

in which cafe Landau must fall ;
6,c00 men defend Landau, and when
of 12,000 Pruflians, who
are expected by the lull, arrive, we
expect a decisive Itroke.
As the pallions a of men begin to j
fubfidc, we are enabled to collect
more accurately the particulars oh
the late tumult. To procure arms
the populace broke open the gates of
the Arsenal, and several of the build
ings near the I'huilleries were let on
fiie.âThe mirrors, and part of the
furniture in the Palace were deltroy
ed ; but those who attempted to car
ry away any thing privately were
punished with inltant death. Many
of the citizens, by wr.y of triumph,
carried the bloody clothes of the
Swiss on the points of their lances.
Amidtl these fccnes of horror, the
women (hewed no signs of that fenfi
bility natural to their sex, and many
of them mixed boldly among the
mob. Towards 8 o'clock the light,
of the flames, the approach of night,
and the fight of many dead bodies,
particularly those of the Swiss expos
ed quite naked, exhibited a fpedtacle
awful and horrid beyond description.
âThe mob in their fury seemed de
termined to destroy every veltige of
. Royalty ; the ftatuesof all the kings
were overthrown ; not even except
ing that of the great Prince Henry
IV. At the throwing down that of
Louis XV several people weie killed,
and others much 1 hurt. Every
fignboard,which had the King's head,
was destroyed ; and the Setftion of

THE enemies of our government insinuate that
the bank and the fyfLm of public c red it tend
to raise up great men to the prejudice of that equal
liberty which we now ertjoy. A certain Gazette
feeins to have been set up and kept in pay, in or
der to inculcate that opinion, and lev bring tlvfr
into abhorrence who arc pretended to have con
trived and supported those inOjKirion&for the pur

the head of the government and its officers, to the
members ot Congress, and even to the
holding the property depending on these hated
According to this primary intention, we
entertained with such auxiliary scandal as the
wit and inouft'y ot the inventors can supply. We
are told twice a week, that public men make mo
'lcy by (peculation, the conrt is fafcinated with
its own glare and splendor, the corrupt minions
of power engross the government, the virtuous
old lepublicaris lament ihe decay ot the fpjrit ot

a monarchy. Let any man read the Gazettes with
attention, and he will fay that if the government
and those who adminiller it be not the word on
earth, they arc (certainly the very worfl treated.
It is not easy to suppose that their foul suggestions
can, with any truth, be applied to a government
new and frefh from the hands of a sober and vir
tuous peopleâand this conviclion would go far
towards refuting the malicious pretence, that the
bank and funding acts v/ere made with an inten
tion, and that they really have a tendency, by
fifing up great men, to impair the equal rights ot
the citizens.
In every thriving nation the wealth of individu
als will augment. The savings of indullxy will
m a fund which will bt* inceflantly on the in
crcjfe. "The employment of this accumulating
capital will afford a profit, and this very profit
wll furnifh a new cayfe of Iwelling the wealth
of thccountry. No man will fay that to prevent
Â£'eat men, we will fuffer no rich men among us.
- 1 Un less you stop the course of inr*iftry, so as to
pi event its ulual earnings, and contrive by law to
hinder men from laying up what they chufe to
dv c in their expences, this capital wilT f<vcll in
j'nie into a great mass. But any attempt to regu
late th: gaining or spending piivatc property,
ill accord with our notions of a free govcfn
mentj'and wc are well allured such regulations
could never be carried into effect. The bank and
tunding fyilem cannot therefore be deemed me
foarce ot the political evil which is supposed to
lurk in the increase of the wealth of individuals, !
fiuce the human character will not ceale to pro-j
ducc it, to long as fcparate property is permuted.
We shall not readily fubm.it to ihc rigid laws of

nant to nature, and Inflow and difficult* of opera,

Another rcfle&ion renders this confutation com
plete. It is a lound remark, that thole who hold
the land of any country, will bold the power,
livery day new diyifions of the old farms are mak
!iior-ânew teulenvcnis are forming : the farmers
find a better market for their produce than torm

But neither the bank nor fund:/; laws, have
created a dollar o' new property. It is true,
the new facility to trade and Circulation, produc
ed by thofelaws, has operated to the advantage of
the nation, as certainly as (and more permanently
than) an addition of silver and gold. Neither of
t Pro I e systems was firft begun in our country by
congress. The states had their banks, and had at
tempted to retrieve public credit before the con-
Uitution Was adopted.
Tlie enemies of government could not fee the

No fooncr, however, d>d congress touch thoic

shew, that the means in question were not well
adapted to the pretended design, and therefore,
could not have been qhofen by men so wife and so
wicked, as the gazette supposes the public men qf
this country to be. The leader will judge how

On the 9th, M. Condorcet in the name of the
extraordinary commiftion, stated to the Nation
al Allembly the various confiJerations connected
with the grand qijeftiojrof the Ring's forfeiture.
This pri;l*ipally of enquiries which
appeared to be decided by the committee t'lem
felves, who fay that at any rate the tfecifion ol
the AiTembly, -whatever fide of the queflion
they adopt, will inflame the paflions of the mul
titude, and the public tranquility will of course
be endangered.
M. Petion appeared at the barâhe (aid that j
a rumour having been spread that a plot was;
formed to carry off the Kingâthe people had af-j
fembled at the Thuilleries to prevent it âdetach-
ments of the National Guards had been ported
at the palaceâand he believed the perlon of the
King was therefore in fafety. M. Petion re
commended to the AiTembly to pursue lenient
and persuasive measures with the enraged po
pulace as the most likely to prevent excefles.
The AiTembly, considering the present dan
gerous situation of the capital, decreed, that,
till order be restored there fliall be a permanent,
fitting. At midnight the alarm bell founded in
every quarter of the cityâthe general was beat, (
and the citizens hurried to arms ; soon
the afTembly were informed that M. Petion was
detained in the palace as an hostage forÂ«the
King's fafety.
The aflembly ordered thatMie fiiould appear
at the barâhe soon appeared, and reported the,
measures he had adopted for the .public fafetyâ
he was applauded âand desired to return to his
duty ; soon after the hall of the aflembly was
surrounded bv an immense croud of people, some
of whom called o%t tlyit the court had become
the focus of the counter-revolutionâand that
every law ought to be suspended, and give place
to that supreme law; the safety of the public.
August 10 âFriday morningâas day light
approached, the minister of justice entered the
147
hall imploring for the King the prtfte&ion of the
Assemblyâwhile the assembly were deliberating
upon the molt proper ipeafunes to be
in this awful and alarmiug crisis; they were
informed that the whole of the municipality,
excepting M: Petion, M. Manuel and M. Dan.
ton, were fuperceded in their offices by eftar
blifhinÂ£4 new temporary admiuiftration by the
people, yhich they denominated a general coun

' placed at the head of the public force, who was
fjrbid 11 obey the ftaff officers, or any authori
ty, but them. The Assembly were again inter
rupted in their deliberations by news of attro
cities committing in different quarters of the
city. Some courtiers had been arrettedâfome
of the King's guards, and an Abbe ; an alarm
was spreadâthe battalion of Marleilles, and oi'
federates from the different departments be
jca:i to fill the avenues to the palace and the af
lembiyâ'demanding vengeance on the traitors
tiiey } had seized â-The unfortunate vi&ims un
derwent a mock trial, were convicted, and ex
ecution immediately followed ; they were put
to death in different forms, and their heads car
ried about on poles. M. Sullan, the Editor of
a ministerial paper, and the Poix for
merly commander of jftie body Of guards were
among the number. About iline o'clock almost
every person who could procure arms hurried
to the Thuilleriesâcalling out for the detlv'oue
mertt of the King.âThe King attended by the

sister and children proceeded to the National
Aflemblyâhe placed himfelf beside the Preiident

wfticn was guarded by a boiy of Swils ; these
haid t>reffed by those who came again ft them
were "at length compelled to fire in their own
defence, and at firff put the mob to flightâbut
being reinforced they rallied again and com
menced a heavy fire on their opponents âthe
gate*; at'laft being opened or forced, an obstinate
combat ensuedâthe Swiss defending themfelyes
with great bravery, and the attack oa them
being continued with furyâthe Swiss were at
length obligfed to yield to iuperior force, and
atmoft to a man were butchered âthey however
fold their lives dear, killing several hundreds ot
their opponents. Among the victims facrificed on
this occasion besides the Swiss guasds and their
Colonel, M. d'Affrey, were, the Abbe Bouillon,
MefTrs. Carle, Mandat and many others. Attei
the mob had got poileilion of the im
mense crowd burst into the several apartments;
some of whom carried to the Aflembly the
OueenY jewells, valuable effe&s, money, and
important papers. The furniture, after being
inventoried, was taken to the fedVions, and the
papers to the committees of fafetj.âDuring
this tumult, while the noise of cannon was
heard in the alterably, and several iliots <?v;en
entered the windows, the members ftill'contin
ued their deliberations âthe Jacobin party ex
.claiming liberty 1 equality J and all railing
tiieir hands to heaven and swearing they would
die to save their country.
Many members being absent, a call of the
house was ordered ; this being decrecd each
member took the following oath : " 1 swear
in the name of the nation, to maintain liberty
and equality, or die at my post." They then
pafled a decree, providing for calling a National
Convention, suspending the executive power,
the civil lift ; the fix minillers in office to exer
cise the executive powerâthe King and royal
family to remain under the protection oi the
legislative body, till the department lliaH pro
vide apartments for them at Luxembourgâ
mean time to be under thefafeguard of the law,
and their defence entrusted to the national
guard of Paris; all magistrates, officers and
soldiers who shall quit their posts to be declared
infamous and traitors to their country.
, Saturda-v, August '>â¢ On motion of M. Brif
fot, the aifembly declared, that the fix minis
ters had loft the confidence of the nation ; upon
which they (Jecreed, that fix,others (hould be
chosen in theif room, from among themftlves;
they also chose three cOmmiffionAs to be sent
to eacli army. A decoeÂ® ofaccufation was pas
sed again# M, Dobancourt, formerly minister
of, war, for not having dismissed the King's
Swiss guards.
Augnft 14. This morning a letter was read
in from the commissioners sent to
the army of the centre, the letter informed that
they were received every where on the road
with blessings and the nioft ardent testimonials
of patriotism. . At Soiflons they had calmed the
miqds of the people, which had been thrown in
to a ferment by inaccurate accounts ot events in
tlie capital. The city of Rheims was illumina
ted on account of the King's being depofecf A
letter written in German, found in the pocket
of one of the Swift guards, was read in the As
sembly, and sent to the Court Martial. In this
letter the SWiss announced, that in 15 days the
Auftnans would be in Paris; that his regimei>t
would join tliem, to exterminate all who might
( prove unfaithful to the King. He added that
their pay had befcn augmented, and that tljiugh
provisions were dear, they wanted for nothing.
Among the various reasons ailigned for the
violent rrteafures of the people oi Paris against
; the King, one is, that he willingly declined ftnd
iog supplies tpr the frontiers- . ,
In contempiatingâthe.ri!*e, progreH) and rtlult
of measures pursued by the predominating par
ty in Paris, there appears to be a regular chain
of events leading to the fatal scene exhibited
at the palace of the Thjjiileries. The commu
nity, of Paris had lately suspended tbe Mayor
and M. Manfal; in order to effect a concert of
operations, the police oft he city was fiibverted
by the feftions, and a new system ihtroduced,
ia which only three members of the preceding
body were retained. The national guards on
the 23th June, bad given strong fympto/ns of
their attachment to the KingâA new comm&>
der was therefore appointed in M. Sai.terre.
Detachments were made from the guards ; theic,
united with the Marieillele and Federate.,
tormed a powerful force, which cmld be de
pended on ; the command of wliich devolved
on IVi. Suntetre, who was not to obey the exit
ing lupe 4 ior oJiiters. This forte thus
and which appears to have been done at the ex
igency of the moment, ejected theobjeft which
the w ho<e bnmx-ls bears ltrong appearancss ct"
having l>een determined on.
M. MaiUat who was as above men
tioned, wa? Commandant of tie National Guard
M. Sullan was Secretary to the Queen ; about
20 women who belonged to the C*ourt were
drowr.ed, they lied tp the biidje and threw
themselves over the bailaftrade. 60of theSwiis
who eleaped at the palace were afterwards fa
crificed by the populace at the place de Grave.
