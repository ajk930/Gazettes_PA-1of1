FROM THE BALTIMORE EVENING PO!>T.

1 4
THAT the manufactures of our country, are
of" too mush importance to be neglected by a
government, expressly instituted to promotetbe
general welfare is almost a felt-evident proposi
tion. That they should be promoted, however,
does not seem entirely to the taste of some po
liticians ; but as the thing cannot be attacked
direCtly, recourse is had to innuendoes and fuf
picions, under cover of" zeal for I lie public good.
The writer of" the article " ManufaÃurcs" in
.yo.ur firft paper, would have it understood, that
Congress ought not to encourage mmujaÃures, left it
(hould open a new field as he exprelfes it, " for
favoritifm, influence, and monopolies," and left Con
gress should excise them. It may be observed, in
reply, that it cannot be shewn that encouraging
manufactures .by laws, is contrary to the nature of
liberty ; contrary to the principles and spirit
of our constitution ; or contrary to the liqua
tion ofaffairs, or the true interest of our coun
trvâone at least of which points ought to be
dear and unanswerably demonstrated to render
their nou protection by law juftifiable. Again, if
experience is to have any weight in the determi
nation, it is notorious that the principal manu
factures of France have sprung up or increased
in proportion as they were protected and en
couraged by duties on imported articles, of a
like fabric, as those intended to be favored;
and that the growth manufactures in England
(its rival) have by the fame means and from
the smallest beginnings, encreafed to their pre
sent aftonidling magnitude, when the value of"
their woolen manufactures alone, exceeds eight
millions flerling, per annum, Congress with these
and. such like examples before them, have laid
protecting and encouraging duties, and our manu
factures have already sensibly felt their fetter
ing- operation. Our distilleries, paper and gun
powder manufactures; our rope walks, dock
yards, iron founderies, naileries, card-making,
shoe and boot manufactures, with a variety of
others, that might be mentioned, have all since
these duties.took place increased, and are in
creasing, whereby much money is retained in
the country, more employment given to our ci
tizens, and the home consumption of our pro
duce tonlide.rahly augmented. What then is
this favoritism and influence, which is held up as
aione fufficient to induce us to forego theft
manifold advantages, and what are we to un
derstand from the words favoritifm and influence,
which at this distance from the (eat of govern
ment, convey scarce any diftintt idea. Will
this influence and favoritifm counteract the opera
tion of the laws, or if generated by the laws, is
it of so dangerous a nature to public liberty as
to render it necessary for the people to eleCt
members of Congress, who will repeal these
laws and damn the fame of their enactors > It
may be remembered, perhaps, on this occasion,
what the Englilh Lords ComniJ/ioners of Trade and
Plantations recommended in their report to Par
liament, 1732, or 3, respeCting certain manu
factures, set up in the colonies. "It were to
be wished (fay these Lords) that some expedient
might be fallen upon to divert their thoughts jrom
undertakings of this nature, so much the rather,
hecaufe those manufactures in process of time
may be carried on to a greatc degree, unless an
early flop be put to their progress." The writer in
the Evening Post, may not, it is true, with to
to be thought to go so far as these Lords Com
millioners, and yet there does not seem to be a
wide difference between putting a flop to the pro
gress of manufactures, and putting a flop to the en
couragement of manufactures. The other argument
if it can be called one, suggested by this "writer
against their encouragement goes to this, that
it is better to leave them to Ihift for themselves,
rather than by encouraging them, they should
become objeCts of taxation. What shall no
thing be encouraged because one day it may be
taxed or afiized ? And is it found reasoning to
fay, that if government encourage a manufac
ture it must therefore be taxed, as if tht one
inevitably led to the other.

Can a government by representation, a Con
gress and President dependant on the voice of the '
people, be compared to a despotic glutton, who
fattens only that his repast may be more deli
cious. I would submit to the candid reader,
whether such insinuations are not better calcu
lated to render our government odious than re
fpeftable. " A rcafonable jealovfy is (no doubt) a
rtpublican virtue j" but holding up the laws as
having for their objett the mojl infamous vhzus,is
certainly very different from a u reajonable jea
lousy" A cautious people, however, who have
reason to confide in their re;?refentatives, and
in the person at the head of the government,
who has a check upon the passage of laws, will
always carry in mind, when they read news
papers, which furnifh the public with abusive
pieces against government without their re
plies, that one of the most - fallible ways to
make men enemies to the Conjlitution, is to make
them enemies to the laws.

From the. George-loivn Weekly Led^r i
The jollowing DISCOUKSF. waÂ» de/ivtredby Mr
William H. Kerr, at the ceremony nj laying
the Corner Stone of the Federal Bridge h the Gen
tlemen CommiJJtoners.
RESPECTED AUDIENCE,
I 7"E have the peculiar happinefsof aflVmbltng
VV at this time for the two-fold pur pole, of
celebratiug the anmvcrfary of our Independence,
and of performing a cuftomaiy ceremony, relative
to an undertaking, materially ufetul to the public
in genera), as well as ornamental to this place in
paitieularâlor the purpose of commemorating au
event not only ihemoft interesting and important
to our United America, not only the most cele
brated that has heretofore graced the annals of
any nation or age, but one to which we in a great
measure owe all the innumerable advantages we
at this day possessâone whole consequences have
roused the just indignation of the many millions
who weie held in contemptible slavery by the iron
fceptie ofdefpotifm ; have taught the tyrants hov/
to rule,and made them tremble on their thronesâ
and whose influences will ere long reach the rfc
moteft corner of the habitable world : And alio
[ for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of
the firft public building, now ere&ing in the fu
ture metropolis of an empire established by that
event we are now celebrating, and won from the
dominions of an unjudaof) ci uefoppreiTor, by the
right hand of unity ana freedom. Around this
| (tone as upon the foundation of the firft altar creat
ing in the territory of freedom and fcdcial'.fin, let
us join our congratulations on this auspicious day,
which has furmfhed anew era in ihe empueof
libertyâwhich lias recalled the age of p?triQiifmÂ»
valour, and hfroick virtue, to be again the scourge
|of coward tyranny and oppreflionâwhich has
i atfed the depressed human mind from its groiic
. ling servility, exalted it to freedom, and reiip
prefTt d it with the image of its maker ; lure let
us refleÂ£t with grateful sensations upon the memo
ry of those who facrificed their ease, their fortuneÂ®
and even life itfell, tp purchase us these blcflings ;
who nobly ftept. forth in the hour of danger and
amidst the horrors of unequal war, in defence of
their rights and those of their posterity, who
[{coining life without liberty, in the ardour of
manly heroism fuffcied and died with the fortitude
of martyis, and worthy of the cause in which they
foughtâ'Twas liberty with the rights of equal
justice for which they bled, and it is Indepen
dence, with peace, happiness, and plenty we have
gained. Here let us utter forth our wiftus with
patriotic fervency for the prosperity of our coun
try, that country which was purchased for us at
a price we ought ever to hold dearâthe sacred
blood of virtuous rural heroes, and the last deep
agonies of the dying braveâHere also let us ex
press our gratitude to the living who have been
inftrumcntal in procuring us the bleflings wc en
joy. The statesman whole keen penetration dis
covered, and whose pen unfolded to view with
unlhaken firmnefs those dark insidious snares of
a venal ministry, and the oppreflive schemes of a
corrupt government âThe generous patriot who in
the hour of public embarrafTment laved her (inking
credit, and whose liberality fuoplied every ne.eef
fary contingencyâThe hardy veteran who has
survived his brother soldier in the bioody si Id,
who has sustained the hardfbips of a tedious cap
tivity, and who now enjoys those blellings he has
so bravely wonâthese, all these have a just claim
to our thanks, our gratitude, and our eftcemâTo
discriminate generally, would be unjust, and to
recapitulate particularly upon the several services
rendered by each, would exceed the di sign of this
address, and be a talk to which my abilitieSr are
by no means competentâbut fuiely there is one
character whom America can boaftof, which the
most deserving and the most impartial, will nqt
hesitate to acknowledge, deserves a superior (hate
of admiration and esteem, who notwithstanding
his precautions to elude the burst of gratitude and
the shout of heart-felt applause, which every where
attends him, is (till the pleasing theme of every
tongue, and the obj e6t of united esteemâ so long as
public and private virtue, wisdom, courage, and
gratitude is reverenced in our land, so long will
his illustrious atchievments entitle him to the
foremoft place among the highest rank of heroes
and statesmen, and the worthiest in the field of
fame ; but his services in behalf of his country,
joined to the unanimous voice of united America,
exhibit an elogium far surpassing my feeble pre
tencesâWhen the remembrance of kings and em
perors, those fceptcred scourges of mankind, 2re
loft in oblivion, or only mentioned to excite de
testation, the name of Washington will be
idolized, as the saviour of his country, and the
friend of mankindâwhilst the dcfpolic crown is
falling from the head of royalty, and the dwindled
rays of monarchy are loft in the spreading radi
ance of the star of liberty, the laurel wreathe is
bloomiiig on his warrior brow, and the lustre of
his fame will extend to the latest ages.
Thrice happy land !âthe highly favored Colum
bia ! is there a national b telling distributed, but
what is bountifully dispensed to theeâtime,
and circumstance, all confpne to make thee happy
âamongst the various revolutions that have over
turned empires and destroyed kingdoms, there is
not one upon record, which has been so happily
concluded, or so generally bent ficial to mankind
âstretched over an immense territory, you enjoy
not only the necessaries of life in superabundance,
but all the varieties that luxury can ask, or that
( lime and foil can produce-âand amongst all the
nations of the eastern world, there are none whiefj
arcpoficfled of such internal refourccs, or whose
pfolpefcts of future acquifuions can be compared to
thineâplenty fmilek luxuriant throughout ourboundless plainsâand each stream is co
vered with the produce of our land ; our fl.>g is
displayed in the remotcft harbor;, and the choice!)
productions of either Indies is wafted to our happy
ihores ; the ignorant and unpolilhed pcafant's
offspring, from the bountiful earnings of his la
bour, is enabled to acquirc the secret of philoso
phyâthe inyflcry of the [ciences, and the know
ledge of history and civil police ; the equal rights
of man arc l'ccurcd ; no petty lordling can deprivr
laborious indigence of the hard earned morfcl ol
industry ; nor can the ambitious nor the rich do
mineer with impunity over the poor and humble ;
the sfts of the government are mild and favorable,
and the excellent conftitutton of our country is
peimanenily cftabliflicd -, cities are raised in the
defart wade, and well couftrufled edifices orna
ment our social abodesâwhilfl art and natuiecon
fpire to elevate us to opulence, elegance, and pow
er. To contrail this description with that of any
other nation which now exills, is a talk unnecel
favy, and foreign to the purpose of this, notwith
standing, I am well a(Tured, the obvious difference
in our tavor would appear evident to the mod un
informed of my audience, upon even a fuperficial
difcuffionof the afore-mentioned particulars. It
is our bufmefs as a nation, to profit by the expe
rience of past ages, to avoid the causes of former
revolutions, and to enjoy the blefliogs bellowed
upon us, with a virtuous temperance, and a due
regard to the public good.
It may not be improper here to observe, that I |
have it from reputable information, that this very !
traÂ£t ofland upon which the r Federal City is to be
ere&ed, was recorded bv the l original proprietor
by the name of Rome, and that a stream which
runs through the fame is in that record, called
Tyher ; that prophetic spirit that saw the glories
of a second Rome rising in the wilderness, and the
beauties of aTyber wind ng amongfl these sur
rounding hills, would surely now, with incicafing
ardour, pronounce the future splendor of this fa
vored place ; Romulus fit ft founded Rome (after
wards the imperial mistress of the world) upon ihe
ruins of violence and conquest, and amidst the tu
mult ot internal difTention ; Columbia rears her
metropolis under the foftering hand of the father
of his country, and with the united encouragement
of peace, liberty, and unity.âThe,. Romans were
an inconsiderable people for a series of ages, and
arrived by flow degrees<o the empire of the world;
America has already made rapid advances tQ a dis
tinguished place amongst the nations-âher com
m< rce and alliance is courted by those very people,
who a few years part considered her as only an in
fignificant colony ; well may these cultivated
fields and luxuriant pastures, soon be compared to
those celebrated plains of Aufonia, and the Cam
panian lawnsâyonder rich stream may soon vie
-with the famed Tyber, in elegance, ornament and
beauty; this will ftiortly be the feat of the arts
and sciences ; of eloquence and the rriufes; other
Virgils may here artfe to celebrate the beauties oi
cultivation, and Horaces to pour forth the polish
ed songâa future Cato, a Brutusâa Caifius may
here display the resolution and fortitude of the pa
triotâ-and a second Tully may here exhibit to the
liftcning multitude, the irrcfiftable charms of his
eloquence, whilst all around is but one continued
scene of civility, and grandeur.
And thou firftof sciencesâmost ufeful artâand
noblefl effort of geniusâdivine jfcrhiteftiue, may
wc make mention of theeâ divine in thy origin
as coming from the supreme source of wisdom
and orderâufeful to mankind as contributing to
our fafety, preservation, ornament and conveni
enceâand noble as to beauty, oider and perfec
tion.âlt was a plan of thee Which existed in thf
ideas of the supreme sirchiteft, when frrft he laid
the solid basis of this immense universe, when h<-
reared the orderly Qsbric of creation, and deco
rated it with those innumerable ornaments, which j
shine conspicuous throughout the goodly ftru&urc
â'it is agreeable to thy proportions, we are sash
ioned from the wombâand an idea of thy beauty
is infufed into man, with that celestial spark of
immortality, which com"s from the great Father
of order and harmonyâour civilized abodes con
fefs the use, and rife up under thy fafbionino
hand, to elegance and magnificence âevery ufeful
or ornamental ftrufture owes its beauty and (labi
lity to theeâwhat else is nature arrayed in all her
splendour, and throughout all the incessant chan
ges that vary her appearance, but so many differ
ent forms and combinations of theeâThou end
lcfs, boundless source of order, harmony, and pro
portion.
I would conclude this address, with an attempt
at aifplaying the many and peculiar advantages
which this diftri&manifeftly enjoys over any other
place in the Union, for the permanent feat of the
Federal Governmentâbut from the favorable situ

NEW-YOR K, July 19.
At a meeting of a large and refpedla
ble number of citizens at Corre's
hotel, in the city of New-York, on
Monday evening, the i6ih inflant,
pursuant to public notice given in
ieveral newfp*pers and hand-bills,
a number of resolutions were pafled
approving ot Governor Clinton's
election, as constitutional. Are
{peiftful address, it was also agreed,
ihould be presented to the Gover
nor by a committee named at the
meeting.
Pursuant to tliefe resolutions, seve
ral of the committee, accompanied by
a very refpe&able number of their
fellow citizens, waited upon his Ex
cellency yetterday, at the government
ho life, and presented him with the
following address :
Tobis Excellency George Clinton,
Esq. Governor of the State of New-
York.
May ic pleafeyour Excellency,
A refpeeftable number of our fel
low citizens, met in consequence of
certain violent anil inflammatory tnea
fures now pursuing by a party in this
date, have deputed us to address your
excellency in their behalf, toexprefs
their fatisfac'tiou on your re-ele(dion ;
Ithejf reliance on your fortitude, pa
triotism and perseverance, iji oppofi
ti<fli to an attempt upon the conditnti
on and laws of your country,and their
drffermination to unite with you in
preserving the peace we now so hap
pily enjoy, and in defending a con
dilution so well calculated to preserve
that tranquility from violation.
In offering you our warmed con
gratulations on your re-election, to
an office you have lo long filled with
integrity and reputation, we are per
suaded we speak the sense of a large
majority of the free and unbiafled
electors of the date. When we rely
on your fortitude and patriotic cou
rage, that confidence is judified by an
experience as their exertion in the
mod perilous times; and when we
tender our alTidance and support to
maintain the conditution and tran
quility of the date, we do it from the
melancholy convi<ftion, that both will
be endangered by the efforts of party
zsal, and disappointed ambition.
By order of the committee,
Samuel Osgood, Chairman
H. G. Sleght, Secretary.
To which his Excellency returned the
following Answer :
Gentlemen,
I receive, with great sensibility,
your congratulations on my re-elec
tion to the chief magidracy of this
date : Ever happy in being favored
with the approbation of my fellow
citizens the time at which your's is
bedowed, enhances my edeem of the
obligation it confers.
When I reflect on the good sense
and patriotism which has ever didin
guifhed the people of this date, I can
not but entertain a hope, that the
measures to which you allude, will
be difcotitinned, as Toon as they (hall
be found inconsistent with good order
and a regard to the constitution and
laws under which we have the hap
piness to live. In this enlightened
period, when the rights of man are
so well underdood, and the blefiings
of liberty and peace so highly prized,
a spirit of free enquiry should not
only be permitted, but encouraged
upon every quedion in which the con
llitutional privileges of the people
may be concerned. While the dif
cuflion is conducted with temper, and
by an appeal to the reason, not to the
paflions of our fellow citizens, those
who have done right need not fear
the invedigat ion ; a good cause will
ever find its bed and firmed support
in its own merits.
From the moderation you have al
ready evinced, 1 cannot think it ne
ceflarv to recommend a perseverance
in such temperate meafui'es, as will
not only fatisfy the public that you
are actuated by principle andafincere
regard for the welfare of your coun
try, but miift, in the end, be attended
with success.
After thanking you, with finceriry,
for the very obliging terms in which
you exprcfs yourlelves in my behalf,
permit me to aflure you, and the gen
tlemen whoin_yoti represent, that in
clination, as well as duty, will ever
prompt me ro co-operate with my
62
fellow citizens, in every legal and Re
cefl'ary measure to maintain inviolate
the constitution and tranquility of the
ilate.

' Announces, that the armies of
France had not come to any engage
ment since the battle ofTournay and
Mons ; the failure of which had pre
vented the army of M. de la Fayette
fiom commencing its operations:
they write that his army is under the
best discipline, and request that those
who have aflaffinated General Dillon,
may be brought to punishment. Part
of three regiments of cavalry have
deferred. They put great confidence
in the National Guards, and each
corps are burning with desire to dis
tinguish themselves. They fay that
Offend is to be garrisoned by Dutch
troops, and Anvers by Prussian, and
that the King of Pruifia had declared
himfelf againfl the French Nation,
had fetit intoAuftrian Flanders 42,000
men, and had set off for Colbert.
Private persons had demanded per
mission to fit out privateers from Of

which it appears that the merchant

ther party. In consequence, the pre

England, was the fame as before the
commencement of the war. Accounts

of Seringapatam by Lord Cornwallis.

ALBANY, July 16.
The Directors of the Western and
Northern Inland Lock-Navigation are
summoned to meet in this city on the
27th inltant, tor the purpose of com
mencing their operations immediate
]y.
As respects the western, it is confi
dently expected some important part
of the canals wijl he accomplished this
season. The prevailing idea now is,
thatinfteadof 10 years, this great
and important work will be accom
pliihed in three or four years. It is
supposed by spirited active operati
ons, that the work will be better and
cheaper done in 4 years than 10 ; and
it certainly will be greatly to the be
nefit of the proprietors.
The legifiature have granted 30001.
to build a bridge over the Sprouts of
the Mohawk river, whenever the sum
of 10001. fliould be subscribed and
paid. A subscription for this pur
pose is going forward with spirit in
this cityâwe are told Gen. Schuyler
has subscribed 2001. This bridge will
be one of the longest in America,and
â will open a direct: communication to
a very extensive country, progrefling
fait into (ettlements, in the North-
Weft part of this state.
Albany being fortunately situated
at the head of the navigation of one
of the fineft rivers in Americaâwhen
this bridge and the canals are com
pleted, it inuft incieafe with an un
exampled rapidity.
The Bank of Albany will com
mence its operations this week; there
can be no doubt but it will tend to
enliven and invigorate trade and ma
nufactures, and above all, to eltab
lifh a habit of punctuality.

Extrafi of a letter frcm a gentleman at Cape-Francois,
to his friend in this town, dated June 30;
u The people of Port-au-Prince, the Mole
and Jeremie, will not accept the Decree of tin
National Aflembly. At Port-au-Prince, the
fitted out five cruisers, to prevent supplies fron
being carried into any of the out-ports ; the;
like wife sent a 20 gun ship, and four fmalle:
veflels, armed, to the Mole, to bring down ;
General to command them. âHe accordingly
embarked with 300 volunteers, 500 Hand o:
arms, and every thing in proportion. On hi;
way down he was taken by a 74 gun ship, anc
carried into St. Marc, with one of the Hoops :
the other three escaped. I arrived at St. Mart
the fame day, and the day after the Governoi
of Hifpaniola arrived from the Cape, with ano
ther 74 gun ship and a frigate, when the Cap
tive-General, Borel, was ordered into close
confinement, and all his men. The Governor
then received on board 400 volunteers of St.
Marc, and on the 22d inft. failed for Port-au-
Prince, with the two 74 gun fiiips, a frigate,
and a 2? gun Hiip ; at the fame time 2000 Mu
-lat toes marched down upon the back of Port-au-
Prince, with the French Commiflioner, who ar
rived from France, a white General, and the
Commander in Chief of the Mulattoes, in order
to enforce the decree. I left St. Marc the 25th,
and no accounts from thence had then arrived;
but, 011 t'ie 24th, in the afternoon, we heard a
very heav; cannonading, for about two hours,
which we supposed was at Port-au-Prince; if so,
there is no doubt but a total deftruffcion will
take place. We are in hourly expectation of
hearing from thence.âThe people seem really
fighting-madâ each port wishing to destroy the
other; some in favor of the King ; others, for
the nation, the mulattoes, the free negroes, the
llaves, &:c. What wiilbe the consequence, God
only knows. - "
FROM. THE GENERAL ADVERTISER.
ON a due confide ration of the various advan
tages that have been derived to United
America, from the operations of the Federal
government, there cannot be a friend to his
country that will not exert every nerve to per
petuate suel 1 - great and r ol?d benefits ;âBut
more peculiarly are the people of Pennsylvania
called upon to invigorate a fvftem, that has, in
so superior a decree, contributed to her agg an
dizement:âthere is no calling, no profeffion,
no walk of 1 that has not experienced its pro
pitious influence.
But this government, founded on the princi
plesi of eqn-.il re pre fen tat ion, requires at dated
periods, fmTrages of the citizens at the elec
tion oi the Members of the Legislature.
The time is now approaching, when the
good people of this commonwealth will be sum
moned to exercise tins right.
But ill order to fix 011 proper characters to
meet the approbation, and unite the futiiages
of the people in a general Ticket, it will be ne
ceflary to propole a conference with our filler
counties, when a full and fair discussion will take
place, relative to the characters and requisite
qualifications of those persons who are the belt
calculated to perform the duties of federal re
presentatives. The Deputies oi' this confer
ence must give tone and vigor to their proceed
ings,âthey lhould therefore be men, who have
a personal knowledge of the leading characters
of the State, who have acquired a stock of po
litical reputation, and in whom confidence can
be placed, both with regard to their judgment
and integrity.
No man of this description, who is called up
on to serve in so honorable a capacity, it is pre
sumed, will dare to decline the appointment,
except his public and oiticial iituation might
render his interference objectionable on the
part of political decency and decorum.
It becomes, therefore, the citizens fcrioufly
to reflect on proper characters to be font 011
ttifs important million ; and above all consider
ations, to permit no jarring diviftons to defeat
the great objeA in view ; âotherwil'e, thole
who are inimical to the Federal government
and the belt interests of Pennsylvania, will have
reason to rejoice in the fuccefsful issue of their
oppofitiou A PHILADELPHIAN.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
Mil. Fenno,
THERE never was a more barefaced attempt
to impose on mankind than is contained
in the aflertion so frequently made, that an arif-.
tocratic junto exists in the United Statesâa
junto 44 who are using every effort to prevent
the people from investigating the principles of
religion and government." By a junto, in the
language of the National Gazette, is meant the
men whom the people have chosen to administer
the government of the United States.
It isufeful to recur to past tranfaClionsâthey
will often refrelh our memories with advan
tageâand if the bronze of impudence could ad
mit a blufli on their countenances, the phizzes
of certain declaimers would be fuffufedin crim
son, who fay that our civil rulers are pursuing
similar measures with those adopted by the ty
rants and opprelTors of mankind, to keep the
people in ignorance.
The Prelident of the United States, in his
speech to the firft Congress, strongly inculcates
the importance of competent provision for en
lightening and iuftru&ing the people. His
words are, 44 that there is nothing which can
better deserve your patronage than the promo
tion of Science and LiteratureâKnowledge is
in every country the surest basis of public hap
pinefsâln one, in which the measures of go
vernment receive their impreflion so immedi
ately from the sense of the community, as in
our's, it is proportionably efiential." In the
President's speech at the opening of the firft ses
sion of the second Congress, this interesting ob
ject is not forgottenâhe therein states the im
portance of the poft-office and pofl-roads, as
they refpeft the expedition, fafety and facility
of communicationâ 44 their instrumentality in
diffufing a knowledge of the laws and proceed
ings of government, which, while it contributes
to the security of the people, serves also to guard
them against the effects of misrepresentation and
nrifconception."âPurluant to this reprefenta
tionand recommendation, the twohoufes patted*
and the President approved and ligned, the new
poft-office law, which makes provision for dis
seminating information through the Union, on
a scale greatly fuperiorto any thing ever before
contemplatedâthis law is predicated on the
molt patriotic principlesâit is now going into
operationâand should it be found injurious to
the interest it was designed to promote, the dis
semination of information, it will doubtless be
revised by those who have given the most irre
fragable evidence that they were actuated by
the best motives in passing it.âThus much for
the sentiments of the Chief Magistrate on the
subject of diffufing light and information among
the people. Let us now hear the opinion of the
Vice-Prelldent of the United States on this
point. In his Defence of the American Consti
tutions, he faysâ 44 Schools for the education of
all fnould be placed at convenient distances,
and be maintained at the public expence. The
revenues of theftate would be applied infinitely
better, more charitably, wifely, ufefully, and
therefore politically in this way, than even in
maintaining the poor âthis would be the best
way of preventing the existence of the poor.â
If nations should ever be wife, instead of ere<sl
ing thousands of useless offices, or engaging in
unmeaning wars, they will make a fundamental
maxim of this, that no human creature
shall grow up in ignor ancfu" If we turn
our attention to the other persons concerned
in the administration of the government, we
shall find that their habits, sentiments and opi
nions, have uniformly been in favor of the
rights of the peopleâin favor of universal edu
cation, universal informationâfor they have
found by experience that all the difficulties
which have attended the administration of the
government, have been owing to the want of in
formationâto the influence of the mifrcprefen
tations of those who have maligned the adminis
tration as inimical to that knowledge and in
telligence on which they depend for the fuccefs
ful operation of public measures, and the pre
servation of general tranquility and peace.
Mr. Fenno, the friends of the government, it
is said, are the patrons of your Gazette. I
wish this may be true in so extensive a sense as
that you might find your account in itâfor tho'
it has-been called a venal paper, and some epi
thets have been bellowed on you as its Editor,
which I fliall not repeat âthis I know to be fa<st
âthat the Gazette of the United States has publifii
ed as much, or more, on the fubjeft of Educa
63
tion, than all the papers in tlie Union, since its
firll appearance ; and the attempts to imprel's
the public mind with its importance to the pre
servation of the liberties of our country, have
been urged in almost every poilible form, in
eilays original and feleflcd. ' CRITO.
For the GAZETI f. of the UN J TED STATES,
Mr. Editor,
IT would be a reflection upon the nnderftand
ing of the citizcns ot there Hates, to suppose
they will patronize a newspaper which inces
santly teems with abuse of our government, and
the measures which have brought us to our pre
sent enviable situation jâand your subscribers
in particular, Mr. Fenno, cannot be pleased
with extracts from fuel) a paper. I confefs they
disgust me very much, and have often wondered
that you so frequently republic the anti-federal
sentiments with which the National Gazette is
constantly fluffed. If the printer of that paper
pays you for telling the world, twice every
week, that such a paper exists, you have a bet
ter reason for doing it than I apprehend ; but
if you do it gratis, it would be well for you to
reflect whether the credit of the Gazette of the
United States may not be injured by it. Â£).

Mr. Fenno,

X ceives a salary from government:â
Que reâWhether this salary is paid him for
tr inflations; or for publications, the design of which
is to vilify those to whom the voice of the peo
ple has committed the administration of our
public affairsâto oppose the measures of go-
and, by falfe insinuations, to disturb
i the public peace ?
In common life it is thought ungrateful for a

Philadelphia, July 25.
By European accounts under the Paris head,
it appears that the people of France have been
amuftd with flattering accounts of the good
state of their armies; for M. Fayette in his
letter to the Minister of War fays he is in want
oi many neceflaries ; and though the numbers,
zeal and ardor of the troops were equal to the
most sanguine wishes of the friends of the revo
lutionâyet another account fays his army was
absolutely destitute of every thing ; and that
instead of marching to attack the enemy's coun
tryâthe division encamped at Tiercelet was
compelled to return to its quarters without
powder, ball, field pieces, or artillery men.
Spain it is positively aflerted will not join the
enemies of the revolution ; the Minister has de
clared that the Swiss which were to have been
taken into the pay of Spain are unneceifary.
i The Pope has sometime since undertaken to
drain the marches of Pontiniâthe work has ad
vanced so far as to render theAppian way prac
ticable, which has been for many years covered
with water in many places.
The inquisition it is said is very severe a
gainst those ot the French patriots who attempt
|to difleminate revolution principles iii Rome.
The universality of the French language will
however have a powerful influence in spread
ing the knowledge of freedom among the peo
ple of Europe.
To prevent a deficiency in his revenue, it is
said that the King of Sardinia has lately been
profufe in titles of nobilityâsome fay his object
is to annihilate nobility by making it universal.
The French at the oufcfet of the revolution in
order to render nobility contemptible, transfer
red titles from the master to the valetâbut
this did not long continue for the valets soon
found that titles were a degrading diftin<stion,
where the highest denomination was m an.
In r.n address of the National AfTembiy to the
French Nation is the following energetic len
tcnceâ" The tortures and lhame of an eterual
iervitude would not fufJiciently punish a nation,
who should fuffer their liberty to escape them
after having acquired it."âTo insure vi&ory
they fay, it is necessary that discipline lhould re
gulate all the movements of courage, and that
diftrnft should never suspend or destroy them.â
There can be no triumph without the absolute
obedience of soldiers to their officers, of offi
cers toHheir generals ; with their constant and
fraternal union.
Some late accounts from Holland fay that
the Stadtholder and his wife are eager for a re
conciliation with the Dutch patriotsâthat age
neral amnesty has been publishedâthe preroga
tives of the Stadtholder abridged ; and the
orange cockades, as well as all other marks of
party, laid asideâBut all this does not fatisfy
the patriotsâreal Liberty is what they want,
and not merely palliatives which do not go to ;
the root of the diseaseâthey refufe the amnesty,
as they fay it implies criminality, with which

Corporations in France have fuffered an uni

A society hi?s lately been instituted in Lon
don, entitled, . Friends of the People ; afloci
ated for the p:Â»rpoe of obtaining a parliamentary
reformâthey held their firft meeting at the
Freemason's Taz.em, London, the ?6tk April, I 792,
and have pub]lined a declaration, an address
to the people of Great-Britain on the obje&s, to
etfeft which, theu have auociated, Viz. First, to
restore the freedom of election, and a more e
qual reprefentatiou of the people in parliamentâ
Secondly, to secure to the people a more fre
quent exercise of their right of electing their
representatives.â To this important bufmefs
they call the attention of the people in an im
paflionate, independent addrels, reprobating
anarchy and confufion on the one hand, as well
as despotism on the otherâtheir objett not fee
ing innovations on the constitution, but to reform
itânot to change, but to re (loreâconvinced of
the truth contained in a declaration made by the
Duke of Richmond, That the reflcralionJtf ogenu
ine Houfi oj Commons, by a renovation of the rights of
the people, teas the only icvtedy againfl that fyjhm of
corruption, which had brought the nation to disgrace
and poverty, and threatened it with the lojs oj liberty.

fmb/ance whatever between the cases of the two king

The address was signed by twenty-twp mem
bers of parliament, and a great number of the
molt respectable names in the kingdom.
The passengers from Newry, by the brig
Rachel, Capt. Thomas Suter, have publiftied an
honorable testimonial of the humane treatment,
received from that gentleman during their voy
age from Irelandâand recommend Cupt. Suter
to the preference of those who may wifti to em

We are informed that the spirit of personal
contention refpefling the late election in New-
York, is fad subsiding awayâand that thole
wliofe feelings have been the moll alive on the
occasion, are now determined to wait for the
interposition and decision of the Legislature.
In the Columbian Centinel of the 14th inft.
the public are requested to suspend their opinion
refpedting the conduct of Mr. Skinner and Capt.
Hickman, owner and Hiafler of the American
schooner Dolphin; who are charged with entic
ing and carrying away a number o*' Negroes
from Martinicoâas from an infp6&ion of pa
pers in the hands of persons in Boston, concern
ed in that velTel, it is supposed some great mii
underftanding or misrepresentation has taken,
place in the business.
Accounts from Shelburne, Nova-Scotia, fay
that a fire in the woods near that place has done
great damage latelyâwas still burning, and
threatened the deftruttion of that town; we

The anniversary of independence receives
more pointed attention from the citizens of the
United States than any of the red letter days
under the government which existed previous
to the revolution. It is not the observation of
the birth-day of an individual, a coronation, the
anniversary of a vidtory, a triumphâit is the
celebration of an event which comprizes in the
contemplation, all that gives worth to liteâto
manâlt is the birth-day of a nationâit is the
triumph of reason and libertyâthe harbinger of
universal freedom and happiness *>o the race of
mankind.âSince the g ious event of the
adoption of the new Conftitutiori, the people of
this country have realized what the word Inde
pendence importsâLaws and RightsâPeace and
Prosper it) âCredit and Confidence are the rich
poflefljon we now enjoy. Now they behold the
reward of their laboursâwhat they fought, con
quered and triumphed forâand find the pur
chase was worth the cost. Hence every suc
ceeding year appears to enhance the celebrity
of this auspicious dayâevery anniversary re
turn since March, 1789, is noticed with addi
tional demonstrations of joy, feftivity and
splendor.

with the late encroachments of the Ocean there.
TF I believe what heretofore
Has happened to this hollowed fliore,
May the next age piognofticate
An inundation for your fate ;
Then, BelgU Citizens, beware
Of what you can avoid with care.

Should you unto their voice attend.
Behold, with open arms they (land,
Upon the margin of the land,
Proclaiming welcome tothefe plains,
Where Liberty triumphant reigns.â
Come, listen to their timely call,
Thus, from the deep, prevent your fall.
Or will you difregatci their cries,
Close up your ears, ihutto'your eyes, / t-
And on your brittle banks depend t
Against the billows to defend ! \

When building bufU-arks on the fa rid,
Saying that " we will be obcy'd,"
