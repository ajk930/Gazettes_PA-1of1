APPROV ED APRIL THE SECOND, 1792.
PHILADELPHIA.
ENERAL St. CLAIR has resigned the com
v-X maud of the army, and we have been favor
ed with the following copies of letters that pafl
ed between the Prefidenc of the United States
and the General upon that occalion.
Philadelphia, March 26, I 792.
Sir,
I BEG leave to offer you my unfeigned thanks
for the honor conferred upon me, by the appoint
ment to the command of the army of the United
States the last campaign. Though that campaign
was unfortunate, I am not confjrious thac any
thing within my power to have produced a more
happy iff'ue was negledlea. As J was prompted
to accept that command by no motives of either
ambition or interest, but by a fervent wilh to be
of service to my country, and a belief, perhaps
too fondly entertained, that I could be soâ tliac
I am led to decline it in future, proceeds neither
from disgust nor disappointment.
Having been much afflidled with sickness dur
ing nearly the whole of the campaign, though I
flatter niyfelf the public interefls did not fuffer
by it, and though my health is now tolerably re
(lored, my constitution has received a very severe
GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Prejtdent of the United States.shock, and I might not again be able to go thro'
the weight of business which neceflarily follows
the command of an army.
Although, Sir, I am myfelf perfuacled that e
very thing was done, in the course of the lalt
campaign, ihat could be done on my part, fully
to answer the public expectation. yet it is denied
by fonie, doubted by many, and known to but
few out of the army. A wish to retftify the pub
lic opinion, and a duty that I conceive I owe to
myfelf; induce me to request that an inquiry in
to my conduct may be instituted : when that is
over, I may hope to be permitted to resign the
commission of Major-General, which 1 now hold.
Should the result of the enquiry be that, in any
instance, the duties of my station were negleit
ed, or that 1 did not improve every hour and e
very opportunity to the belt advantage, or that
the operations of the army, after it was in a con
dition to operate ; were delated one moment in
consequence of my illnels, I fliall patiently sub
mit to the merited censure.
To whoever may be appointed my successor, 1
lhall be happy, Sir, to give every light and in
formation my situation, as General of the army,
or as governor of the Western Territory, put in
my power to obtain, and to evince to you, Sir,
and to the world, that the confidence you were
plea fed to repose in me, was not mifplatfed.'
With every sentiment of gratiude, of respect,
and, allow me to add, of affection, I have the
honor to be, Sir,
Your mod obedient fcrvant,
ARTHUR StCLAIR-
The President of the United States^
United States, March 28th, 1792.
Sir,
YOUR knowledge of'the country north-weft
of the Ohio, and of the resources for an army in
its vicinity, added to a full confidence in your m : -
Jitary charatfter, founded on mature experience,
induced my nomination of you to the command
ips the troops on the frontiers.
Your desire of redHfying any errors of the pub
lic opinion, relatively to your conduct, by an in
vestigation of a court of enquiry, is highly lau
dable, and would be readily complied with,were
the meafur'e praJiloable.âBut a total deficiency
of l'grvice, of competent rank
to forjn aflkal fuu't, for that purpose, precludes
the pow4(Pgratilying your wishes on tlieocca
fion.
The intinv. in jfyonr readiness to afford your
successor all the tv foi mation of which you are
capable, although linjieceffary for my personal
convicftion, must be regarded as an additional e
vidence of the goodness of your heart, and of
your attachment to yoi'.r country.
I am, Sir, â¢
With eiieem and regard,
You' iT!--ft obedient servant,
G. WASHINGTON.
Major-Genrra) Arthur Sr. Clair.
Philadelphia, March 31ft, 1792.
Sir,
1 HAVE intl the honor to receive your letter
of the 28th inft. While I lament that circum
stances preve." ai into my condudt,
by a court of 1 uiry, I cannot but acquiesce in
the reasons you have aliigned why it cannot take
place ; and 1 beg leave to present my thanks for
the desire to have gratified me, had it been prac
ticable, which you have been pleased to manifeft.
In my letter of the 26th, I exprefled an inten
tion of retiring from the army, when the enqui
ry ihould be over.âThe only reason T had for
wishing to retain my commilfion until that time
was, that if any inifcondudt should appear in the
eourfe of the enquiry, I might be amenable to a
court-martial, which a resignation would have
precluded. The House of Representatives: Sir,
have diredied an enquiry into the caufcs of the
failure of the last campaign to be made by a com
mittee of their own body :âthe fame reason that
influenced me when a court of enquiry was con
templated, operates now with equal force, and
â therefore it may be proper that 1 Ihould still re
tain iny cnniniillion bur, as it will soon be re
quisite that some person should be at the head of
the army who is to continue to command ir, it is
necessary, Sir, that I fliould inform you explicit
ly, which I now do, of my fixed resolution to re
sign the moment the enquiry is finifhed, should
no fault be found, that any embarraflrnent which
may exist, with refpedi to providing a fucceflbr
for me, may be removed.
Be pleased, Sir. to observe that my sole objert
is to give effect to public iuftice, in the usual
way by a court-martial, should it appear that, in
any manner whatsoever, the misfortunes ofthelalt
campaign can be attributed to me ; and it is the
proper, and I believe the only tribunal, where
military crimes and mifcondutft can be enquired
into and puniflied ; or where an officer's reputa
tion, infinitely dearer than life, can be vindicat
ed.â Should the public service, however, require
that another officer of the fame rank with me be
appointed immediately, I am ready to make the
vefignation forthwith, notwithflanding that it
may feern to proceed, and at a distance will be
supposed to have arisen, from a sense that the
volume of calumny and defamation, which is
daily pouring from the press into the public ear,
has too much foundation for me to meet it,âthat
1 (brink from the consequences and chufetofhel
ter myfelf in a private Nation :âI am ready, Sir,
upon this occasion, as 1 have been upon all others,
to facrifice every private and personal feeling
and consideration to the public good.
1 have the honor to be, Sir,
Your molt obedient servant,
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR
ThePRESiDENT of the United States.
United States, April i,th, I 792
Sir,
I HAVE read and duly considered your letter
of the 31ft ultimo.
The reasons you offer for retaining your com
mission, until an opportunity Ihould be presented,
if nerell'ary, of investigating your conduct in
every mode prefcribjed by law, would be conclu
sive with me, under any other circumllances than
the present.
Bui the eftablilhment of the troops allows on
ly of one Major-General. You have nianifefted
your intention of retiring, and the efl'enrial in
terests of thepublic require that yoor fucceflor
iliould be immediately appointed in order to re
pair to the frontiers.
As the Honfe of Representatives have been
pleased to institute an enquiry into the causes of
the failure of the late expedition, 1 should hope
an opportunity would thereby be afforded you
of explaining your conduift, in a manner fatisfac
tory to the public and yourfelf.
I am, Sir,
With esteem and regard,
Your moil obedient servant,
G. WASHINGTON.
Major-General Arthur St. Clair.
â¢ Sir,
I HAVE had the honor to receive your letter
of the 4th instant.
Although 1 was very desirous, Sir, to hold the
commiHion of Major General until the enquiry
by the committee of the Honfe of Representa
tives should be over, for the reasons I assigned,
and which you are pleased to think have some
weightâyet the necessity of the officer being ap
pointed who is to command the troops, in order
to his repairing to the frontiers, is certainly
prefling, and ought to silence with me every wifti
of a mere personal nature. Ido therefore, Sir,
now formally resign the appointment of Major-
General.
I have never, Sir, entertained a doubt that an
enquiry into the causes of the failure of the late
expedition, whether directed particularly to my
conduct, or to that connected with other causes
that may have operated in whatever way it might
be conducted, would not prove honorable tome,
and fatisfatfory to the public, as far as I was con
cerned with it ; but setting, as I do, a due value
upon the public opinion, and desirous not to lose
that place in the elteeni of the virtuous and in
telligent of my fellow citizens which I have long
held, you will not wonder that, under existing
circumstances, a degree of anxiety, not only that
there ftiould be an enquiry, but that every thing
capable of being misconstrued, fliould be avoid
ed or. my part. I will own to you, Sir, that the
desire of honest fame has ever been the ftrongelt
paflion in my breast : I have thought that I had
merited it, and it is all that I have to compensate
for the facrifice of a very independent situation,
and the best years of my life devoted to the pub
lic service, and the faithful application of my ta
lents, such as they were, in every situation in
which I have been placed, with a zeal bordering
upon enthusiasm. I trust, Sir, J fliall still enjoy
it, while those who have attempted to disturb it,
will be forgotten, or remembered with indigna
tion, and in their bosoms, if they have feeling,
sensations may arise something similar to what
Milton has described to have seized upon Satan
when he discovered our firft parents in Paradise.
With every sentiment of refped: and duty,
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
ARTHUR St. CLAIR
The President of the United States.

" In my lad I omitted to give you an account of the war in
India, between the English and T.ppoo Saib, the son and succes
sor of the late Hyder Ally, and one of the mod powerful Prin
ces in it. The commencement of it was in March, 1790, tn con
sequence of an attack on a Prince in alliance with the Englilh.
General Meadows, who is Governor ot Madras, took the com
mand of the army from that quarter, and in April, moved to at
tack the enemy in their own country, which is separated from
the Carnatick by a chain of mountains called the Ghauts, which
have but lew narrow passes, deemed impafTable, without it is ac
quired by stratagem.âAster a number of mifcarnages on our part,
coufequence of a treasonable correspondence being earned on
during .he whole campaign, by a native Check >n our ferv.ee, tn
orming the enemy of every movement to be made. Meadows
vas obliged to return to Madras. Lord fiom Bengal,

immediately took tlie command. The above correfpondm e
coming to light, proved fuccefsful to Lord Cornwalhs, wno avail
ed himfelf of it, by sparing the author's life to carry on the cor
refpondcnce as before, and direst the enemy to guard a dilierent
pals, which was pretended would be entered on a certain day ;
by which means our army, when w-:s in the enemy's
country, and soon joined by molt of the neighbouring princes.
Lord Cnrnwallis, fecondcd by Meadows, soon loiind tliey were at
the head of nearly one hundred thousand, horse and foot, includ
ing ten thousand Europeans, and the native troops employed by
the Lnclilh, little interior to them. Their movements soon com
menced towards the enemy's capital, which lies nearly in the cen
tre of the country ; in their way towards it, every thing ft llâthe
second city among the number; and alter an oblfuute action in
last May, Tippoo was obliged to (hut himfelt up in it. The pe
riodical rains then setting in very levere, put a Hop to further pro
ceedings oil our part *, fiiice that, I have not acquired further in
formal ion.
" When the campaign again opens, Gen. Abercrombie, Go
vernor of Bombay, will be ready with about 10,000effc&iye men,
to join the grand army. And by the time I reacn India, it is my
opinion a decisive stroke mull be struck, or it never will. It is
reduced to a certainty that the views of the English is to extirpate
Tippoo, and rid themfelvesof a troublesome enemy, as well as to
acquire more territory, besides the riddance ot a tyrant to man
kind in generalâsuch is his character.
41 Although I freely venture my opinion in juflice to 1 ippoo,
I think he will not be an easy conquest. He is at the head ot an
immense army,a great general and politician, who hath been bred
in the field and cabinet, from his infancy, and pertedly acquaint
ed with all the arts of war, conformable to the European mode,
and what is more, fighting for life and empiie ; The toi mcr mult
ensue firft, as he never will submit to the latter, while it remains,
is the opinion of people in general, either by the hand of his ene
my or his own. If opportunity will permit when I arrive at
Bombay, I will write you all particulars.

Two causes of great importance io the intercfts of humanity, wete

their cruelty to negroes. The firft was charged with unneceffai y

PORTSMOUTH (N.H.) March 7,0.
The British nation, convinced of the injustice
as well as the ill policy, of negletfting the petili
ons, formerly presented by their American fub
jedls for the privilege of a resident Bishop in the
Colonies, and the consequent hardships to a part
of their citizens, who did not enjoy all the insti
tutions of their religion without one ; have now
made piovifion for the support of three Biihops
in their North American Provinces. Three thou
sand pounds, are contributed by the national cha
rity, for the annual support of clergymen and
schoolmasters of the national church, and the
distribution of books of piety and devotion. New
churches are eretfting, schools opening and a
college founding. They are determined to give
every poflible encouragement to the spreading of
religion, morality and learning in those regions,
under the fandlion and proredion of government.
Description of a LOCK, in Canal Navigation.
A LOCK is a bason placed lengthways in a ri
ver or canal, lined with walls of raafonry on each
fide, and terminated by two gates, placed where
there is a cascade or natural fall of the country ;
and so conftrutfted, that the bason being filled
with water by an upper fluke to the level of the
waters above, a veflcl may ascend through the
upper gate ; or the water in the lock being re
duced to the level of the water at the bottom of
the cascade, the veflel may descend through the
lower gate ; for when the waters are brought to
a level on either fide, the gate on that fide may
be easily opened. Butasthe lower gateisftrain
ed in proportion to the depth of water it supports,
â when the perpendicular height of the water ex
ceeds 12 or 13 feet, more locks than one become
neceflary. Thus, if the fall be 17 feet, two Jocks
are required, each having 8 1-2 feet fall; and if
the fall be 26 feet, three locks are neceflary, each
having 8 feet 8 inches fall. The fide-walls of a
lock ought to be very strong. Where the natu
ral foundation is bad, they fliould be founded 011
piles and platforms of wood : they Ihould like
wise slope outwards, in order to resist the preflure
of the earth from behind.

FOR SALE,
BLOOMSBURY,
THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in New-Jersey, occupied for many years past by
the fublcriber; containing upwards of 200 acres ot land, besides
a trail of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the didance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
Trenton 10 Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the (aid street on the east, and by tht nver on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined effeÂ£l of fix
ation and improvements generally allowed to be,one of the moll
beautiful and desirable feats in the Hate. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-fintftied brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brLk
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both (ides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new lion:
coach-house and stables, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining theft is a very complete granary,
rat proof, ami a stone cow-house, upwards of 100 feet in length,
containing thirty-one paved stalls, over which is a roomy loft for'
hay, &c. Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is a gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
(late of culture, and abounding with a rich colle&ion ot the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large asparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well
built, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large chcefe-room
spring-house, garden, &c. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
celfary out-building. The ground is properly divided into Jmntl
fields, all well watered, highly improved, and chieflv under the
most approved grass. This square has produeed annually, for se
veral years past, upwards of, sixty tons of the best hay, besides
supporting through the fuinmer season twentv to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper seasons,
with great plenty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frefh water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl ; both of which
may afford a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, it inclofcd and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar ports,
and rails of chrfnut and white cedar. The purchaser may have
the improved square separately, or the whole together, as may
best suit him. There is an inexhaustible quantity of good build
ing stone on the river ftiore. The purchase money, if well secured,
and the interest punctually paid, will not be demanded foi many
years.
Any peifon desirous of viewing the premises, may be gratified
on application to Samuel W. Stockton, Esq. of Trenton,
or Mr. Inallman, who at present occupies the .'aim-houleand'
part of the landâand may know the price on application to the
fubferiber, at No. 213, South Second-street, opposite to the New-
Market, in Philadelphia. ]OHN COX
