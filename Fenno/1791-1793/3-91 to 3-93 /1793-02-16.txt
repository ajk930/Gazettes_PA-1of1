MR. Fekmo,
Jftndyou Sketches of the Proceedings of a Club of
Hon. and horned Gentlemen ,friends ojthe P 1
oj this State, at a vieeting held in the early part
of lafl month.âThe genius and the tmiabltncfs
of Tome of the members who comp'fe that Club,
deserve to be held up to the admiration of the
world. 1 thercjore hope, that you zvi/l do the
Citizens of t\i> State particularly, the favor of
fubltffiing them. Your's, 2.
ON the 3d day of January, in the year of
our Lord one thousand seven hundred
and ninety-three, the seventeenth year of
American independence, and the third year of
the Presidency of the Hon. T. M. Esq. of t-e
State ofPânfylâa; the Hon. J. S. Eiq. J-
H. m.d. p.c. &rc. &;c. the Hon. J. ><â  Elq.
Câr Gâl of the (late of Pânfvl âa, and the
Hon. A. JD. El'q. Sây of the aforefaid (late,
aflfep.ibled, by the fide of a good fire, in the
study of the Hon. J. S. E r q-âfor the purpose
of holding a solemn consultation on their own
particular political situations, on the present'
(landing of the Hon. T. M. Esq. and on af
fairs of state. After (pending several honrs
in mimjtelv examining their own particular
conditions, and mutually adininiftering con
solation, and advising each other firmly to ad
here to their nohle leader, and persist in their
virtuous practices, they proceeded to the PrrÂ»'-
Aent'sprefent zvsi future probable (landing. On
this point they perfectly agreed, " That as
many delicate consciences revolted agamfl his [\Jlem
of morality and politics, it was necelfary, to se
cure his future influence and consequently his
feat in the chair of state, bv the eftabliftiment
of a Bank peculiarly calculated to effect that
end."âOn the affairs of state, it was their
opinion that every wheel would move glibly
and pleafantlv, in fine, entirely agreeably to their
defirrs, provided they could secure to their be
loved friend, the hor.orable, the virtuous Prejident,
the Piefidency of the Jlate during life â¢
Those important objects being examined
and adjusted, the next confederation which
arose, was, " By what means (hall we exhi
bit our true lete and Inxalti to our worthy leader,
the Hon. President of the State ?" (I had
like to hare been guilty of an unpardorable
negled, and forgotten to mention that this
figactous and nobly gmteful question originated
in the head of the Hon. A. jf. D.) This questi
on had scarce issued from the lips of the pro
poser, when loyalty, tike an electric spark.shot
through the breast of every member of the
clubâTheir eyes closed with the emotions
produced by their exceffivelv tender love,their
under jaws suddenly dropped, their months
gaped, and a m xture of admiration and won
der erected " every particular hair," like the
bristles 011 the back of the terrible hyena. A
silence of full five minutes reigned, when the
members with one accord opened their eyes,
raised their jaws and dropped their hairs, and
after much puffing, blowing, and foaming at
the lips, (the effect of inspiration) the Hon.
J. S. Esq. ("aid, " That as the mind of man,
when filled with any great and noble pafilon,
naturally breaks out into broken, abrupt,fhort
numbers, like unto a song, he (hould think,
and did believe it his duty, and the duty of
each member, to address the Hon. President
in song." (Here clapping of hands, damping
of feet, and roars of applause interrupted the
learned gentleman, who involuntarily clapped
his own hands, in admiration of his wildom
and eloquence.) And I, (continued he) pro
pn r e, that by this day one month, that is to
fay, 011 the.third day of February next enfu
in'r, we (hall meet here again, and each gen
tleman bring his address in poetry, to the Hon.
President, for the purposes of mutually bene
fitting, by critiques on each others verses,
and rendering them worthy of the fubjeft of
our panegyricksâBravo ! bravo ! was the
cry, and an awful silence of ten and three
quarters minutes ensuedâThe Hon. J. N.
then lifting his chair nearer to the Hon. J. S.
Esq. knitting,his brows thoughtfully, flowjy
moving his head up and down and tideways,
in a see-saw manner, (like one of those loofe
headed beautiful china figures usually stuck
up as mantle-piece ornaments) and biting his
lips, spoke thusâ" Dear fir, I beg leave to
utter a doubt which struck me during the
time of our fileuce. I have heard 'tis a hard
matter to write verses, and perhaps the time
which you have allotted us will be rather too
short tor the arrangement and statement of
our love, in verses." True, added the Hon.
A. T- D. for as Horace fays, " Pcrta najtilur
von fit." " Weil ! what of that! cried tl e
Hon. J. S. ftarirg rather difrefpeftfully in t!:e
fate nf the Hon. gentleman, well ! what of
that ? Surely he is on my fide ! man, he is on
my fide," (purting his fore finger to his note
and fmirkinf). "On your fide ! pray fir,
how on your fide ?" Why ! (replied the Hon.
gentleman) T will clearly "state it and prove it

piety being wounded) why are you so tvarm ?
I'll prove, I'll prove to you what I have af

So there beini> three in favor of, and but one
against the question, it was carried by a ma
jority of two in the affirmative. Notwith
standing this novel, but jair mode of deciding
the question, the Hon. A- J. D. could not pre
vent his unruly tongue, uttering cxprt/fions of
discontent, which txprefom, being overheard
bv the Hon. J. S. caused him to address the
Hon. gentleman as follows â¢ " Sir, I perceive
your difcontejit, I am very willing JIM to
prove what I have alterted, by making an ex
ample of myfelfâDo you believe that I was
born tp be a poet ; I mean, to be a poet in
spile o/mifel/; for certainly I was born to be
a poet, as I am oneâbut you understand me,
do you beiieve I was a poet when I was born!
K >Jo'' fternlv replied the Hon. member ;
âif I prove myfolf a poet now,
you will believe that I was right in my tranl
lation!"â" Mod certainly, yes."âThe Hon.
f. S. then turning round to each gentleman,
begged he would excuse him, for half an hour,
as he was going into hisgarret, to be retired,
and make some verses to prove hiwftlj a pcct,
and to fatisfy the Hon. gentleman of the
truth of his translation of Horace's text ; but,
gentlemen, he questioned smartly, nibbing
his hands, what shaH be the ? " Ac
counts, accounts," cried the Hon. J. N.
" well accounts," said the H'.n.poet,and went
up flairs.
In 27J minutes, he returned with fpark
l:ng eyes and upright (tep, and repeated the
following conpletâ
l< Accauvt> are account, of thing! put douw uhtvfold,
Â«> In Uank books made, accounts oj things to hold."
The glaring beauties of this couplet, must
strike every reader. It needs no explana
tion, the concise and perfpicuons definition of
the word accounts, the sweetness of the verftf,
must impart infinite pleasure to every reader
from the Clerk of a Sheriffs Office, to the n
dorer of Homer and Virgil. The moment
it was read, dumb aftouiflime; t 'ci;on eve
ry hearer. At length the Hon. A. J.D. tliough
verv reluctantly, and in a very low voice,
confefTed his e'ror, and alkcd pardon for his
ftubbornels. The Doctor rifihg, took the left
hand -.f each gentleman, and putting them in
to each other, said, "be friends," they cast
their eves on the floor, smiled and fat down ;
(the Hon. J. S. tiling, said) " thus you fee,
men were made to be poets and I hope you
will no longer object to my propoial."â-You
may indeed, at the firft trial, expert to find
ihme labor absolutely necessary to the per
feflion of a poem, but, practice makes per
faft. The firft time that I tried my hand at
it was, on the following occasion : I had a
Cat, which I called Patty, in honor of a fwaet
female whom I courtedâThisCat was beau
tiful, and as I had named her Patty I loved
her tenderly, I kept her in my bed at nights
and often hugged her to my bol'om and thought
I was squeezing my other Fatty. Unfor
tunately Patry was in the ftorc cellar, hunt
ing mice, when my porters were hniftinir
fowe hogrtiends of Wett-India ; the ropes
broke, Sirs ! and a whole heavy hr.gfhcad fell
directly on Patty'steck ; I was instantly call
ed into the cellar, for the porters knew my
love for Patty ; and there, when they rolled
away the fatal hogftiead, was 'he poor crea

I began to think how I ftiould honor her me

dered the Hon. A. )â  D. to read them aloud,
which he did, as follows :

Afflicts my bosom, yea, I burn indeed !

Such was the melting power of these lines,
ami the pathetic tone of the reader's voice,
that, by the time the rending was finiftied,
every foul preterit, even the author himfelt,
blinked his eves, fijivelled, and was iicceJfita
ted to blow his note. Indeed the watry foun
tains of the author were lo completely un

eyes and hoses, but the*fight of him, for a mo

D. turning his head towards the Hon. author,
whom till now he could not fete,echoed, a An !
(and continued) I was really wrong in my as
sertion, that man could not be made a poet,
and I believe old Horace did not intend to
have written so daring a falfehood.â Fhe
opening of the elegy is unusually tender, but
the pathetic expression of the firft line in the
second stanza cxcc s every thing fit a ftmilar
nature iti Ovid or Tibullusâand the compli
ment in the last line of the lame, is inexfjrrjibly
delicate.' 1 â" But dont you think (said the
Hon. J. N.) that the line, 4k Ah ! must 1 lie
each winter's night alone !" and the one next
to it, 44 Ah ! must I lie without my dear to
to hip," is very moving? It ahe&sine mighti
ly indeed ; but the next two lines, '' why
surely I (hall freeze and turn to stone ! my
blood will freeze like water in a mug !' fti&e
me as being the most sublime of any m the
whole lamentation. 44 Why futely I (hull

44 and turn to stone," at this my whole body
shivers ; I think I fee a stone statue. 1 hen

That! that ! who can ft and that? It puts
me in mind of a cold, terribly cold and ticez
ing winter, when my water in mv membei
mug (no offence toanyofthe members I hope)
under my bed has froze solid ard to save my
blood from freezing alio, I have brought my
knees up to my month, thrown the blankets
over my head."âHere the Hon. gentleman
was startled and interrupted by a mournful
moaning found from the Doftprâ 4 ' Ah !" fairl

. That the citizens, of the cajtern Jiutts are in gene
ral republican, no one will quejlion Tlex have
given too many proofs of that important.truths for a
doubt now to exist on that point in an\ part of the
Union. Whilfl, however % the fentwents oj a few
particular charaflen were csnfdered as an indication
of those of the slates from whence they came, some
painful apprehenjions begtn to be entertained that ine
public mind had undergone a flrange tranfuion in
that quarter. Rht the fervent joy lately dr[played
throughout those slates, upon the Juccefs oj the frenck
arms in thecaufe of liberty and equality, has dispelled
every doubt on that head, and revived a general con-
Jidence in the purity of their principles.
The following excellent paragraphs are from the Mail.
The Profperjty of the United States, is, and
ought to l>e a fubjt-cl of grateful meditation to
every patriotic American. In private life, one
of the best preservatives against the turbulence of
difccntent, is an habitual reflection on the daily
comforts a man enjoy*âthese, when incorpo
rated as It were with our being, will lose a great
part of their importance, unlets the mind, either
fiom a religious or a philosophical turn of tho't,
be frequently called to their contemplation.
Nations, Jike individuals, may be contiafted
in their chara6fcers and eiâ¢ cumftances : and in
forming an climate â¬>! all earthly good, we are
forced. fiom our ignorance of absolute perfec
tion, 10 form a judgment of the happiness of erÂ»
ther bj comparison. Our fituatton in thisiree
and enlightened republic is, under tbii view of
the fubjeft, indeed prosperous and happy.
The greatest part of Euiope is in a state of tu
mult and uproar. Where war does not yet ab
solutely rage, the vices and the fad fpe&arle of
delpotic governments will probably soon pro
duce disquietude and revolt.âThis country on
the contrary, at this moment poflefles, and I
hope enjo)S, the model of all reprefentaiive free
republicsâa state of agriculture, progrefiiveand
luxuriantly produ&iveâarts and manuta&ures
advancingâmorals and manners as yet pure,
and the completed freedom in religion. No
country on earth would bear tins description
except the United Statesâmay they dr.ftrve these
blcflings, and rationally enjoy them.
It has been jufily remarked, that the tar.es
of no country on earth carry with them Juch
a consolation as attends those of the United
States. The debt, the interest of which they
arc principally designed todlfcharge, wrs glo
riowflv incurredâlt was the price of freedom
âand formed a part of the estimate of our
noble Independence. Taxes in Europe, on the
contrary, are raised to feed an ignoble penfion
lift; to pay the debts of miferabie ambition ;
or, to gorge the harpies of royalty, and of
courts. But here, the moral quality alone of
government leads them to levy taxes. Justice
demands a discharge of just debtsâand he who
pays a penny in this free and prof'perouscoun
try, accompanies the due with the patriotic
idea, that what I now pay is for what I, as a
free man, enjoyâit is just.
That occasional calls of the attention of a
people to pious exercises are proper, seems to
have been the usage and the principle of all
nationsâat least of such as were civil zedâ
In private life, a well regulated mind enjoy*
many of its sweetest moments in a silent but
deep sense of the bleflings it may poflefs from
a j nfl: Providence. If there be a duty in the
individual, enforcing this rational species cit
devotion, it moil be a duty on a more enlarg
ed scale, in a Nation, to do the fame. But
in a country as free as our's is, there is no
particular denomination of devotion termed
National. Yet the duty is surely equally
incumbent on all. The diversity of opinions
relates chiefly to modes ojJailh. All good men
profefs and actually fee] a firm belief in the
dispensations of an over-ruling Providence,
All may in their own way, manifeft a rational
and sublime gratitude to Heaven, for national
good. Theft? reflections are forcibly urge 4
on the mind by all the occurrences which hove
lately taken place in Europe, anjJ by the con
trast to them which the bappinefs of United
America enjoys.
Every civic feaft ought to be a scene in
which Americans Ihould breathe the spirit of
gratitude for the mighty blefiings they poflefs.
Their tumults over; their Freedom fecyred;
their prosperity enlarging, and their country
happy, as the lot of human nature admits-â
My countrymen, true patriotism will teach
us to feel those good things, as becomes ra
tional btings, and fill us with gratitude to
Heaven.

and nightsâl lived during the who'e time

know Doflar is a powerful stimulant to the

and so greatly was I by it", pathos,
that I gained not one wink of ileep that night
âThe next morning being wearied, I fell in

Pattyâ-immediately on beholding her, I broke
out into that foiritted addreft which begins
the second stanzaâ 1 ' Ah ! ah ' dear patty !
Oh ! ah ! oh \ dear Cat !"âWhert I awoke
at four in the afternoon, I put down the line,
left I (hould forget itâthen getting my cot'
fee down and walking twice across my room,
I was capable of purftrfng my labor, and by
next day evening finifhed the second stanza.
In twelve days I finilhed the other four stan
zas, and the sixteenth day I began to read
over my work, in order to make corrections'
in grammar and spellingâl came to the line
" Ah ! what have I to do but lie and !"
I saw something wanting, and being then un
der the influence of ftroi-g coffee, and of the
poem as I had read it eolle&ivcly, I fat down,
and before night completed the poem, by that
matter-piece of composition the concluding
stanza. The three remaining days I spent in
corrections and copyingâFor the fpeUings I
always followed Entick's pocket dictionary.
Thus, my honorable and worthy friends, you
fee what labor can effect ; and as I have done
this poem in so short time, you ought not to
despair of completing your panegyrical poems
in the space of one month But before I con
clude, gentlemen, let me take the liberty to
observe to you, that the best and easiest me
thod I have found to make verfew, is firft by
putting down the words which rhyme to each'
other, which you can procure from that valu
able book called the Rhyming Dictionary.
This is the mode I follow and approveâand
indeed I believe the great Mr. Pope followed
this plan also, for in his immortal poem enti
tied the " Wife of Bath," the only poem of
his that I have read, I find he has almost eve
ry rhyme from that dictionary." Here the
honorable gentlemen bowed to the learned
author, and the Hon. A. J. D. moved that the

for his information conveyed; which motion
being carried, they were accordingly present

Mr. Fe N NO,
I COULD not help smiling at a late remark on
the Speeches and Refolutionsof certain mem
bers of the House of Representatives of the U. S.
refpe&ing some of the Officers of Government,
viz. " Satan hath desired to fiftyou as wheat." â
1 know the transparent and firm integrity of enc
of thoje officers of mod refpe&able charaÂ£ter : but
tho' I had no (hadow of doubt of his integrity,
or fear of his faith in an omniscient overruling
Providence, failing; yet I could not be certain
of his faith in the intelligence, penetration and
candor of a very great majority of the citizens of
these United States, and a continuance thereof,
"till I considered the further means of ufefql
knowledge and discernment of their own true
interests, and of his real merits and capacity,
which would be afforded in consequence of the
reccnt investigations and fillings of his conduct
since his appointment to that very weighty of
ficeâ I then took comfort, and doubted not,
that even his faith in this refpefl would not fail
him ;âand upon reading his Letter, or Report,
of the 4th inft. I am exceedingly pleased to fee
his foul rife superior to those premature and
groundle-fs insinuations, in a certain precipitate
and remaÂ»kable publication. And though I
perceive he is not insensible to what might have
been the motive to those erroneous and uncandrd
insinuations, yet his answer puts me in mind of
the Angel whvn contending with Satan about
the body of MosesâHe brought not a railing
accusation against him (as in justice he might)
but only said, " The Lord rebuke thee, Satan"
âto which I fay, Amen.
I rannot help ferling hurt when I fee inno
cence and remarkably superior rnen't attackrd by
anv son of Adam or of Eveâbe he whom he
willâas I can with conscious truth declare my
felf a lover of mankindâand in particular, of
the peace, credit, profprrity and honor of these
highly favored United Statesâ
And am, Sir.

PRIVATE letters fromHanau mention, that
they expe& every day large reinforce men t*
from Austria and other powers.â  Eight days
ago, three Hanoverian regiments arrived alrea
dy at Marburg, where are like wife some Hef
fan dragoons, and ten thousand men more are
ready to march at a moment's warning to the
alii (lance of the Prince of Hefle Caffel.
The regiment of Carabineers of HefTe Caffel
is marching towards Hanau. Three thousand
three hundred Auftrians, who had with them
great quantities of cannon and ammunition,
were obliged to halt at Afkaffenburg, on ac
count of the French being in Franckford. Jw
Franconia the quarters were bespoke for the?
Austrian troops, and they are procuring provi
sions for the men andhorfcs.
It is said for certain, that the Ele&or of Sax
ony is going to march his contingent of fixthou
fand men towards Mentz, and that lix thousand
more are in readiness in cafe of necessity.
LIMBURG (on theLahn) Nov. 9
The Pruflian van-guard, which was quarter
ed here, and amounted to about thirteen hun
dred men, was attacked this day by the French;
these advanced suddenly from Weilburg, with
about two thousand five hundred men. The
engagement was very severe, and lasted from
one till four o'clock. But this timt the supe
rior numbers had the advantage, the Pruflians
were obliged to retreat by the Lah Bridge,
with a loss of two hundred men killed and
wounded. The French then took poffefiion of
our city. They had in the engagement five
cannons served with canister (hot, which gave
them a great superiority, the Pruflians had only
two cannon with them.
The French immediately took pofleflion of
the EleiSloral Caflle and Offices. They demand
ed two thousand five hundred guilders as z con
tribution from the fame, but did no kind of in
jury to any of the citizens.
COBLENTZ, November ir
As soon as the news of the engagement at
Limburg arrived here, the Duke of Brunfwick
marched thither with a considerable body of
troops. The Kmg departed likewise with a (mall
retinue.
P.S. This inflant we received the news, that
the Duke of Brunfwick has drove the French
out of Limburg again. The Pruflian general
Prince Hohenlohe, who commands the rear
guard of that army, covers the city of Treves,
where there it yet a considerable Pruflian maga
zine. Our Elector (of Treves) is gone to Augs
burg, and the Ele&or of Mentz to Vienna.
It is reported that an engagement took place
between the Heflians and the French, wherein
the firft had the advantage. Several Pruflian re
giments pal Ted thro' this city to-day for Lim
burg on the Lahn, where general Kalkreuth;
stands now, who isready to march against Frank-'
fort.
Nov. 12. The king of Pruflia is still with the
army, and the duke of Brunfwick, it is nowaf
ferted, will keep the command in chief. They
have built a bridge across the Rhine in order to
accelerate the march of the troops âA great
many wounded have been brought in here, a
mongst the reft a prifonerof ft ate, whose name
is not known A strong corps ofPruflian canno
neers is marched into our fortrefs. The Carthu-;
fians have left their conventand have taken lodg
ings in town. Their,convent is full of Prussians,<
and several batteries are to be ere&ed there. Ge
neral Ihlow has died here. The French troops
near Weilburg are said to amount to 8000 men.
The army of general Kellerman, which some
reckon at 40,000 men, is already near Mertzig
and threatens Treves. The garrison in Mentz
must be very strong, as every day frefh troops
are marching there ; those that have not room
in the city, entrench themselves under the can
tion of the fortrefs. General Cuftine ilegleils
nothing to secure himfelf; it is even said that he
is about condu&ing the river Mayn so as to
strengthen and secure his fortifications. It is said,
that te ? more regiments are to come from Bran
denburg. Ye Herd ay an express brought the ac
count, that the French had destroyed the Prus
sian and Imperial magazines at Remich and Gre
venmachern.
REGENSBURG, November 9.
The consideration of the third article of the
Imperial decree of the ift of September, concern
ing the fafety and the war establishment of the
empjre, which had been made the order of the
day for the sth instant, has been postponed
quite unexpc&edly a second time. Some fay
that the ele<storate courts had altered their in
ftruclions. So much may be depended upon,
that the day preceding that appointed for the
said deliberations, a number of expresses arrived
at the hotels of some of the ele&oral ambafladors.
A great number of French emigrants arrived
here within those few days, but our magistracy
hath intimated them, that they must quit the
city before Sunday next* Orders have been like
wise given at the gates, that no more French
men {hall be admitted into the city without hav
ing previously obtained a special permiflion for
that purpose.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENT JT IF ES.
In our Paper of 6th iiijlant, <we gave
the fuhjlance of Mr. Murray's rrmaris
On the bill to amend the a& to promote the
pragrefs of the ufeful arts, âthe following
is a more particular fhetch of his olferva
tions on that oceafion.
MR. MURRAY said, he intended to move
to finite out dirritnroj tbr mint, for the pur
pose of inserting, the judge of the diftriel where
in the applicant might reside. As he thought
the bill of great consequence as it related to the
tifeful and ornamental arts, he would trouble the
committee with his reasons. He thought it was
of con equence, that while the law holds out an
invitation to genius, the mode of gratifying the
fair fehoneft inventor ftiould beaseafyas possible.
The director of the mint mull reside at the feat
of government; and if he alone, or any other
person were exclufivcly empowered to issue pa
tents, the benefits of invention would be bnt ]
very partially enjoyed by the citizens who reside
at a diftanca from the feat of government. The
law ought to facilitate the granting of patents,
and as the right of exclusive enjoyment, at least
. for a limited term, was inherent in all equally
in every part of the nation, so all ftiould as far
as possible have equal facility in making their
pretensions known and eff.ftual. A country in
Europe, Great Britain, had afforded, it was
true, much experience on thefubjeiS; but regu
lations adopted there, would not exactly com
port in all refpe&s either with the fitiiation of
this country nor with the rights of the citizen
here. The minds of some members had taken a
wrong diredlion, he conceived, from the view
in which they had taken up the fnbje<Â£t under its
analogy with the docftrine of patents in England.
There is this ftreng feature which diftinguiflies
that do<Strine in that country from the princi
ples on which we mult fettle it in this. These
patents are derived from the grace of the mo
narch, and the exclusive enjoyment of the profits
of a difcoveryis notfo much a right inherent, as
it is a privilege bellowed, and an emanation of
prerogative. Here on the contrary thÂ» citizen
has a right in the inventions th-y may make,
and considers the law but as the mode by which
he is to enjoy their fruits. England is one entire
kingdom. Its court is the feene where its pre
rogative diffufes its bounties, and being stationa
ry at London, the business can be well managed
in afingle spot. Here on the contrary, there are
fifteen Hates sovereign as to many purposes, and
forming within themselves tenters of attraction
for the ingenious and aspiring. London in that
country, not only attra&s as the mart of genius
arid of "all riiat contributes to ease or gain, but
by its immense combination of things aids inven
tion and draws the genius into aÂ£tion which it
may have attractedâBut we are differently cir
oumftanced both as to local situation, and as to
the thing as it regards the principle on which it
is to/be obtained. The diilance from the ex
tremes of the union, or from its center to its ex
tremes, is very g eat. If the power were lodg
ed with the diftricSt judges, the citizen of inge
nuity would have an opportunity of taking a pa
tent certiinly with more safe, than if you oblige
him to take a journey of perhaps fix or eight
hundred miles. The facility of enjoyment would
prove an incentive to invention. Difficulty and
diflance would discourage it, andwould frequent
ly overpower the wifli to obtain a patent for a
discovery, the profits of which would often be
doubtful. One, and but one objetflion had been
made to this alterationâthat if the district judg
es hava the power, patents may issue in differ
ent places for the fame discovery. This would
be an evil,but is not without a remedy. Patents
are matters of record Let it be the duty of the
judge, immediately after the granting of a pa
âº tern, to transmit a copy of the application with
all the necessary description of the article, to the
supreme court, from which it may be easily dif
femmated to every district court, and through
the United States. An inventor desirous of ob
taining a patent, would of courfc examine the
patent records, to fee whether he had been anti
cipated. 1 he grant of a patent does not destroy
a,claim or right founded in priority. Here he
would observe, that if the inconvenience were
not entirely removed by this measure which he
pi opofed, neither was the inconvenience of clalh
mg claims as to originality and priority of dis
covery removed by any provision of the bill as
It ftspj,, sor ewM hmu iitjmcay p .y, v ,.
devifc a complete mode in which it couU b.,
viated. If a man who i, rea! l y tht , k
chufes to try his title a, tÂ» t h c originality of*'
invention, even after a patent in aivrn > 7
he will make ar.d vend the article, and tCfoS
title will be tried before a junr in ââ J 1
brought igainft him by ,h c pi tmtci . ,)*"â¢Â»
mcalure he propofsd were not deemed a W
eqt guard, he would suggest the proprietor 0 f ]
further cautton-Ut.thc application be JLi*
ed and remain 111 the office, at in Fnil-,-
does, he believed, two months in the fh cc 'J
the attorney-general, that a cavui n-..- v be en
tered by any man who mig ht claim or d.fâ¢,'
the applicant s title. p
He believed that the bill, either a* it tend 1
to foftec the genius of men, or wa< ,
with refpeÂ£l to distant emolument and .
chara&er, was extremely important. It was -j*
mod immediately one of thofc laws that emW*
ed national views and national eitwenfhiu anj
looked to an obje& of advantage which n'.lhinz
but a national government could secure. With
out the aid of a general government, the Â»nii u j
of the Americans could, not reap its fruits"; ncr
had the state governments given a fair occ'afiw,
for the display of the ingenuity which he believ
ed existed in the country. As to this great ob
je&, which requires national citiz.-nftiip, the
state laws were impotent. He thought that it
was of consequence that no Jâ, wr . v^r
small or irrelative it might at firft appear, should
be loft ; and where he saw the idea of a patent
law ridiculed by some, and unattended by others
he believed they were accustomed to fahe things
in their appearances, and had not exerted their
reflexion. A little reflection would teach us
that whAtever is great and aftonilhing in the
work* of art was humble in its origin, had been
oppoftrf by ignorance or cramped by poverty,
and had become important but by gradual ivcu
mulation and a very flow progrelfion ; and that
the wisdom of government should bÂ« exerted in
forming a repository, where nothing that mi-fht
eventually be of service should be faffered to pe
rilh. He therefore wilhed to fee such a Is v as
would not only secure what micdit be off -cd
near the feat of government, but invit-and
draw forth the ufeful invention of those who
lived at a distance. That it Ihottld present an r:-
fy method of granting it prote&ion, he then
fore moved, that the judge of the diftri& where
in the applicant may refida, Ihouldbe fubfliluc â¢
edfor Director of the Mint.
