FROM THE AMERICAN MUStUM.
REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION.
THE export trade cf the United States and the increase of
the home coniumption have placed the American produ
ces on a very advantageousfooting. The competition which
ctifts in our markets, between the purchasers for the account
of foreigners of various nations, for our own merchants, for
the great consumption in the leaports and parts adjacent to the
coasts, and for the use of the manufacturers, together with the
occalional lhipments made on their own accounts by the fouth
crn planters, by the millers of the middle States, and by the
owners of the eastern fifhing vessels, afford the cultivators and
fifhermen Co many alternatives, that they can always obtain
the best prices which circumstances will juftify. In ffioit,
these several demands, at once various, steady, and extensive,
efficiently fnpport our agriculture : and though peculiar en
terprise and faculties in commerce and manufactures, the
power of capital, and an intimate knowledge of our trade and
interior system, enable a particular nation to participate
largely in the exports of the United States âthe remainder |
of the world receive from us a very considerable value, and |
the variety of demand which the destination of our exports
proves to exist, affords us certain relief from the confequen
res of the commercial errors of any oi tho e countries, whose
citizens are our consumers. Whenever such errors ihall oc
curâor so far as they may have already taken place,, to dif
fufj a knowledge of our resources among all nations, to in
l'pire them with confidence in our laws and modes of dealing,
-nd to convert our commodities by manufactures, into every
iliape which their occasions may require, will prove the effica
cious corrective, by enabling us to obtain from wife nations a
favorable market for our productions.
It is fatisfaClory toobferve the regular increase of manufac
tured goods in our returns of exported commodities. The
number in each of the two lad years is upwards of one third,
in a lift which amounts to near three hundred articles. Hence
we may infer, that the time is really arrived, when foreign
trade is iucreafed and enlivened by home manufactures. This
idea, together with the domestic commerce produced by them,
will be more particularly noticed in another place.
CONCERNING THE M ANU F ACTU RES OF THE UNITED STATES.
In considering this subjeCt it will be unnccelTary to adduce
any arguments to influence the judgment of the eastern parts
cf the union. Many of our citizens near the ica-coaft oi the

middle States arc equally convinced of the beneficial effects of
manufactures. The cultivators in the iouthern and western
country, and a refpe&able proportion of our mercantile ci
tizens are apprehensive of injury to themselves and to their
country from the pursuit of this object. These are two de
scriptions of persons whom it is in every view our duty to fa
tisfy, if the truth and reason will permit; and it is principally
from a due attention to them, that the iubjeft is proposed to
be examined here.
An opinion has prevailed that the fonthern States will be
facrificed to the eastern, and in some degree to the middle
State", by the plan of manufactures. It is plain, however, 1
that as the foil of the eastern States is not equal to the pro
auction of a fufficiency of provisions and raw materials for :
their own use, they must resort to the more southern States |
for several raw marerials and for new supplies ot provisions.
It is known, too, that some valuable articles for manufatfures
cannot be produced but in the southern States, such as cotton,
and indigo, and that tobacco is almost confined to them. "T he
southern States and western country will have considerable
advantages in the support which the home market of the ma
nufacturers will give at all times, and especially in time of
war (when freights will be high, and shipping scarce) to their
agricultural and landed productions. Even now, in profonnd
peace, it is the cafe. Kemp was delivered in the ports of the
middle State-., from the lands of the southern States, at lei's
than five cents per lb. in 1/9** Nothing would ha\e kept it
at that rate, but the rope and twine manufactories of the mid
dle and eastern States. The breweries of Philadelphia draw
nearly as much of their barley from the Chelapeak as they de
rive from the lands of Pennsylvania. Thef# and other xafts
(how the beneficial beginning.of things. The manufacturers
of mips and cordage throughout the union, procure from the
southern States all their tar, pitch, turpentine, oil of turpen
tine, and rolin. The ports of Philadelphia and New-York,
take three-fourths of their (hip timber fiom their, jufUy pre
ferring veflels of live oak and red cedar to all others. The
owners of the coalmines of Virginia, enjoy the monopoly ot
all the supplies for the manufacturers of the more noitl.em
States,.who live in the sea ports: a demand which is increasing
rapidly. No lead mine of any consequence is yet worked, ex
cept one near the fuperier waters of James river. The south
ern States abound with iron-, and have much moie fuel of ah
kinds than the northern States, and they have streams for the
most powerful water works. Few or no very abundant depo
sits of coal have been yet difcoveicd further noi th or tail
t 'an the waters of the Ohio and Cheiapeak, even in internal
si liations. The ircn manufactures of the United States are
a'readv important ill value, and immensely so in point of uti
lity, or rather of necessity. Farms, manufaaories, (hipping,
fiflieries, fleets, and armies, all demand them. In Ihoit, tie
all-important landed inteveft would languish, and its p^ogrefs
in prosperity would he retarded in the counties of the southern
States, even near the sea, if our present manufactures were
to be abolished, and all future eftabliftiments of thatkind were
to be given up. But their inland and western counties
CANNOT 2ESUPPORTED, UNLESS MANUFACTURES SHALL BE PRO
MOTED and introduced among them. In the counties cl
Pennsylvania beyond the Allegany mountain, are 63,000 in
habitants, and probably 10,000 of these are farmers. The
wool of that country is yet very inconfiderabieâtheir furs
are more abundant. From these two raw material*, no less
than 10,140 wool hats, and 2,200 fur hats are manufactured
yearly in thirty-three hatters' (Hops. Sail cloth (which, when
manufactured, would be worth 30 cents pr. lb.) could be made
at Pittiburg, Winchester in Virginia, Hillftjorough, and Salis
bury in North-Carolina, Camden in South-Carolina, and Au
gusta in Georgia, out of hemp, the value of which, there, does
not exceed 4or 5 cents. To bring a ton of hemp to the sea
ports from those towns, except Augnfta, costs from 35 to 40
per cent, of its value. To bring a ton weight of fail cloth
from the fame places to the fame ports would not toft above
6 or 8 per cent, and the manufacturers' provisions and fuel are
attended with similar savings. DeduCt for a moment the de
mand of foreign commerce from both Alexandria and Win
cheiter, and the latter would appear to be mod: vigorous and
flourifhing; because it manufactures more, having not so high
a market for its provisions and raw materials. These obser
vations apply with equal force to the whole State of Vermont
and to all our interior country. â  The nation that supplies u
with hempen, flaxen, and iron manufactures, takes immenfe
quantities of hemp, flax, and iron from Russia. These Ruf
fian raw materials are purchased at the eastern extremity of
the Baltic, are transported to another country and manufac
tured there, ar? transported hither, and haled through bac!
roads, 50, 100,200, and 300 miles into our most productive
countries which yieldthe requisite raw materials. These faCts
powerfully incite us to fofter manufactures of the fame kinds,
there and elfewnere. Till that (hall be the cafe, we (hall con
tinue to drag those raw materials through the fame bad roads,
and (hip them under charges of carting and freight equal to a
third, an half, and two thirds of their value, according to the
distance. The present system of negleCting and repelling the
eftablilhment of manufactures, appears to otcafion immenft
deductions from the profits of our lands; and due confidt ra
tion, it is believed, would convince us, that the bed interests,
nay the neceflities of our landholders require t:;e introduction
of some kind of manufactory in almost every vicinity.

anecdote
A COUNTRYMAN in Birmingham market (England) was
observed lo laugh while the Clerk was taking a quantity o
butter from a woman, which was deficient in weight ; the offici r
not being pleased with the fellow's want of decency, observed
that it ill became him to laugh, adding, "I took two pounds
from you lad week"â *' I'll lay a guinea ot it," said the country
man " Done," said the officer ; and putting a guinea into the
hands of an eminent tradetman, the countryman instantly covered
it and then with a sneer laid, " had it been two founds could .yon
have taken it Irom me, was it not for being Jhott of that weight
that I loft it ?" The officer attempted to explain, but the gentle
j man who held the ftakts was so perlrftly convinced, that he gave
i if e countryman the lv/o guineas immediately.

FRANCKKORT, February 12.
THE Emperor's troopscertainly march to Bri â 
gaw, and they only wait the answer to the
i equintorial letters for their paflageto put them
selves in motion : 20,000 men will be drawn from
Bohemia, of whom 12,000 will proceed to Fran
conia, under the command ot General Count
Wallis, and Bcoo to Suabia.
This measure, however, is only to cover the
frontiers of the Low Countries, and the Auilrian
poileflions in Suabia ; but even, on thai iuj pofi
lion, it is a measure that cannot fail being at
tended with bad effetfts.
They write from Berlin that the foreign de
partment was never I'o occupied as at the piefenc
moment: couriers arrive and depart daily, chief
ly to Peterfburgh and Vienna. The affairs of
France and Poland are the objedt of their la-
bours.
PARIS, February 17.
On Monday the following letter, in the King's
own hand, was received by the Mayor and the
Municipality :
" Gentlemen,
" I have already mentioned to some of you the
reports which are spread about my pretended
leaving Paris: I thought that what 1 mentioned
ot it would have been f'ufficient for discrediting
these reports ; but as evil minded people conti
nue to propagate them, in order to alarm ther
inhabitants of Paris, and to calumniate my in r
tentiors, 1 will explain my felf clearly 011 my way
of thinking.
" 1 know the duties which the Constitution
imposes upon me, 1 will always fulfil them ; but
1 also know the rights it gives me, and 1 will ne
ver refufe myfelf t lie power of making use of
them. Nothing keeps me at Paris but my will
of being there, as 1 think my pretence neced'ary,
and 1 declare, that 1 will and (hall remain there )
and whenever 1 (ball have teafons to leave it, 1
fliall not disguise them.
" I have 10 add, that if a person is not qnire
deprived of the use of his senses, or incurably
perverse, he cannot entertain the lead doubt ut
my inviolable attachment to the welfare of the
nation, and the inhabitants of Paris.
(Signed) LOUIS." ,
March i. The three generals are ttill at Pa
ris. Luckner is supposed to advil'e war, Rocham
beau peace, and Fayette an offenlive war in pre
ference to defenfive.
A division is talked of among the ministry, of
which the minister of marine is the cause. Iwo
of his colleagues are of opinion that it is impos
sible to fnpport a man against whom he public
opinion is so pointedly declared; and the reft,
that he ought not to resign, and mult be fop
ported.
The Emperor's answer to the King's late re
presentations, wai communicated _ to the diplo
matic committee on Ttiefday, and is expecfted to
be laid before the Aflembly this day. It is long
and elaborately ambiguous. The. substance on
the mod favourable interpretation is :
That his Imperial Majesty does not wife todif
folve his alliance with France; that he never
ineant to interfere in the internal affairs of the
kingdom, nor to disturb the order of things
established by the new constitutionâonly feeing
the person of the King in danger, and the king
dom threatened with a total diffblutiofi of go
vernment, he entered into engagements.with the
oilier powers of Europe, to succour th'eking and
his kingdom, if neceflary ; that the political Itace
of Europe, and the rank which France holds in
it, made such engagements neceflary to save her
from ruin; that these engagements still exist,
but that the execution of them depends on what
{hall pals in France; and that if the person of
the king (hall be menaced, if the republican fpi
rir (hall make such progress as to attempt the
fubvevfion of the monarchy, hislmperial Majesty
will find himfelf obliged to interfere, in conceit
with the other powers who have an interest in
maintaining the order and the balance of Europe.
It inveighs against the republican spirit and the
Jacobin societies, and concludes with a lequifi
tion for ptibliftiing it, that France and all Europe
may be informed of his Imperial Majesty's Hefire
to live in peace with the French nation, as long
as the king and the new constitution accepted by
him, {hall be refpeded as they ought.
Yesterday the Priiffian Minister presented a
Declaration, profeifiug the adherence of his mas
ter to all the points of the Emperor's answer.1
CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY, March 29, 17?2-
In committee of the whole, on the report oj the Secre
tary of the Treasury on the public debt.
MR. GILES proposed a clause to be added to the firrt propo
rtion offered bv Mr. Fitifimons, the ohjrtl of which was
to preclude the admiflTion of thc ( irredeemable principle in the
debt hereafter to be fubferibed to the loan of the United States.
Mr. Giles supported his motion by adducing sundry reasons
The creditors, by not availing themselves in leafon ot the chance
of fubferibing under the terms of the fulWubfcriptionâ the go
vernment, said he, are under no obligation to renew those terms.
He said his motion is to have a subsequent operation, and there
fore cannot be considered ss an infraction of extlling contracts
The irredeemable principle, he observed, is an exotic, and ap
pears to have been adopted without a due consideration of its ap
plicability to our circumllances âThe fundiug system of Great-
Britain has proftratcd that government âthe prosperity of that
country is not owing to its financial arrangements ; Great-Britain
is in us decay ; this government is in its youth âIt is improper
for us to use such (limuUntsas may be necelfjry to induce vigor
in age. The irredeemable quality is the result of necefilty in the
funding system of Great-Britain ; and that principle will operate
its ruin. The argument drawn from a violation of contratts, ap
plies as well to the firft lyftem as to that now propoled ; the re
duction of the inteieft was a violation of the original contrast.
He then entered into a consideration of the principle of equality,
and (hewed from the present {tare of the debt, being pan of it in
the hands of those who were inimical to the cause which this
debt was contracted tofupport, the obligation of the government
to add to the gift which in fa6t has already been made to these
people, by infuling this irredeemable quality, may well be qucfli
oned. He added Tome further remarks, and concluded by faying,
he hoped that a principle which would be so fatal to the United
States, would be rejeÂ£ted, by adopting the proportion he ottered.
Mr. Ames offered various estimates, by which he demonstrated
that funding the debt on the principle now opposed, would not
incapacitate the government from discharging itâon the other
hand, it would facilitate the object greatly.
Mr. Lawrance observed that the oppofers of the proposed sys
tem, after offering various motions, appear at last to be agreed in
a fpecifie objeÂ£t. He denied that the consequences which it had
been said resulted from the funding system of Great-Britain, had
taken place : adverting to the operation of the system in this
country, he said the observations were no better founded âWith
refpeft to the irredeemable quality, he said it was not a novel cir
cumstance ; under the old Congress, foreign loans had been made
on a similar principleâlt is well known, said he, that the old
Congress contra&ed a debt which they could not discharge under
ten years; and the payments then could be only made by instal
mentsâNo fault had ever been found with this traofaftion. He
then entered into a general defence of the funding system ; and
adverting to its operation, he shewed what had been doneâthe
credit of the country had been raised from the lowest ebb, and a
larger sum of the debt had been paid off, than any man in the
country had any conception ofâHere he noticed some remarks
which had been offered yeJUrday by a gentleman, who had said
that the Secretary had insulted the House by his propositionsâ
and said in his opinion such reflections were not merited by an
officer who had done so much for his country. He defended the
irredeemable principle, and fhewfd the advantages which the
country derived from it. He further remarked, that the govern
ment was not precluded from exerting its faculties in discharging
the debt, to as great a degree as any person had proposed, or as
had been confidercd prudent; and while the United States are
thus circurr.ftanced, the douceur to the creditors in the principle
row opposed, is in faÂ£t no poflible disadvantage to the govern-
ment.
Mr. Mcrcer Paid Llie funding fyflem wss not undciflood by the
country at large, and he was not surprized when he found it was
not un<Jerftood in (his HouseâHe was glad therefore to hear ob
servations thrown out, which served more fully to devclope this
fyflem.
The irredeemable quality he was afloniflied to hear advocated
by any gentleman in this House, for sure he was, that no raeafure
of the government was more odious elsewhere, or more uni.vet
fally execrated. He adverted to fomc of the financial operations
of the Briiifli government, and tlicw a comparison which placed
the funding fyflem of this country in a, less eligible point of view
than that of Great-Britain. He said that by an easy process it
could be made to appear that one half, or at least one third of
the 6 per cents might have been paid off, viz. by borrowing at
3 or 4 per cent ; this is the mode which the Bruifh miniftcr a
dopted. He fhewtd from certain flatements, that this irrcdcem
ar le quality operated so the injury of the holders of the 3 per cents
of the United States. The Briti h 3 per cents were ai 100 per
cent for a number okyeats togefhei. He denied that the loans
which had been made by the old government were on the irre
deemable principle ; he said the terms were in favor of the bor
rower on exa&ly similar principles with the contra&s in common
life. He introduced fame observations ol thofc who had wrote
on the fubjefl of financeâhe said that funding fyflems had uni
formly operated to the definition of the common people ; the
principle has railed a fplcndid fuperftru&ure on no foundation
whatever. He contrasted the situation of the modern with the
ancimt Dutch republicâHe dated the enviable situation of the
Swiss Cantonsâthis he said was an eulogiurn on the fleady pro
duce of laboi and induflry.
Mr. Gerry stated his ideas on the irredeemable principle ; he
oefended it on the grounds of justice and policy. He then ad
verted to the operation of the funding fyflemâlt had changed,
he said, the whole face of our affairsâhad transformed us from
the vaflals of foreign creditors, to freemenâhad revived the trade
agriculture and manufactures of the country ; and placed the cre
che United States on an equality with thatot the moll flou
rifhing European governments, and in a situation much fupenor
to some of them.
Mr. HcifWr, in a fpecch of Tome length, opposed the irredeem
able principle, and ihe funding fyftein in general.
Mr. Find Icy said he w?s opposed to the irredeemable quality,
lie doubted whether it was nrot go-n-r beyond what is allowed by
the (jonftitution. He had heard ii often said that principle was
infufed into the system on the idea of its being an equivalent for
a redu6l ion of the intcred ; this idea seems to be afTumed bv gen
tlemen, but he had not heard any of them adduce anv reason in
flip port of tt. He did not think it in any degree an cciuivalenr,
nor did he think the creditors considered it in any such lizhr. He
was not unacquainted with many of the public* creditors, they
r,ot confidcr this as an equivalent; the debtors in this cafe aI
fumed the office of judges, and they only considered what was an
equivalent. He admitted that the debt was above par ; but com
mon interest had not declinedâit was in fatt higher at any
period during the war ; this he said shewed that the irredeemable
qualiiy was not an equivalent; Hence he inferred the cred't of the
country was not I'upported by the funding system ; the present
credit of the country is a nominal and deftruÂ£hve creditâ'there
fore he infilled that admitting the residue of the creditors to loan
on this principle, will not be g'ving them an equivalent : He con
sidered the funding system from the firft, as tending to the interest
ânot of the citizens but of foreigners ;it has given rife to one
bubble after another, which have deluded our citiiens to their de
ftru&ion. He denied that it had encreafed the specie, or circu
lating medium, or raised the value of the lands, or promoted the
manufa&urcs or industry of the countryâthe r.everfe of all this he
laid were farts; credit between man and man is lessened, extra
vagance and immorality have spread their baneful influence. He
then adverted to the fvftern generally, and reprobated it as a de-
the original contratt, thatcontraft which was mod
solemnly guaranteed by the cortftitution.
What is the obligation of the government in refpeft to the resi
due of the debtâhe conceived that the present Congress was per
fectly clear to ast agreeable to the principles of the original con
trail, as much so as the firft Congress. Jn providing for the re
sidue he said the government was bound to pi ovide for it by a
provision to pay 6 per cent, but not to pay interest on interest.
Here he entered into a consideration of the policy of funding the
facilitiesâthis he reprobated as unneceflarily incrcafing the public
debr, and he could conceive of no other reason but that of en
creafing the debt which gave rife to this measureâa measure
which ought not to have been adopted, and ought to have been
prevented by the States doing their duty. He denied the right
of one Congress to fay that another shall not provide for paying
off the whole of the debt or of any part of itâfor this reason he
considered it unconstitutional and should vote against the irre
deemable quality : He had no doubt of the right of Congress to
alter the funding system tn regard to this principle, and that they
would doit whenever they thought proper.
The question being put on Mr. Giles' motion it was negatived,
3 2 to 2 5-
SATURDAY, May 5.
The amendments of the Senate to the two following; bills
were taken into consideration, and agreed to by the House, viz.
The bill concerning spirits distilled within the United States,
and the bill relative to the compensations of certain officers em
ployed in the colledlion of' the duties of impost and tonnage.
Mr. Madison, of the committee of conference on the process
bill, reported that they had met the somrnittee on the part of the
Senate, and had agreed refpe&ing fame of the amendments, but
did not agree to othersâthis report was deferred for conlidera

The hill supplementary to th* ast making provision for the
debt of the United States, was further di He tiffedâa motion to
provide for funding a farther sum on account of several of the

CO N G R Â£ S S
The new government when it was
was known to have many evils to redress, and
many good things to attempt. It is a pleasant
retrofpetft which we have now to take. We find
that every session has advanced the work which
the fenfe"bf America as well as the preamble of
the conditution has marked out as the duty
of Congress. Two primary objecfts appear 10
have given birth to the new form of government.
During the war, all America felt ihe want of
national credit. Our liberties were expoftd to
extreme hazard, because Congress had only pa
per means of refource.âlt is true a free people
fuppliea by an ardent enthusiasm in the common
caui't> almost every thing that was wanting. But
at length time that cools all strong emotions,
and adverle fortune exhaulted the powers of
I paper money. The illustrious General in his
farewel letter, Congress in their jaddrefles to the
people, the attempt to prevail on the (tates to
grant the five per cent, import, and the general
sense of America, shewed the necellity of a go
vernment adequate to the support of national
credit. Accordingly, Congress in the 2d feflion
made provision for the public debt, and induing
it, they have not been unmindful of the other
common obje<S, the protection and advancement
of our trade and manufactures. The laws which
impose duties on imported articles, have given
a spur to the activity of trade and manufadures.
she wealth of the nation has grown with its in
dustry in a wonderful manner. Experience, the
judge of nations, and their forms of government,
has decided in favor of the American.
Among the objects of the present feflion, the
provision for the Indian war has been the mod
adverse. The government has nothing to hope
for. It has more than land enough to fellâand
as to the honours of vitftory, experience has not
afforded much to expect. Neither the pride nor
the cupidity of the administration could desire
the continuance of the war.âUnwelcome as the
profccution of it certainly is, government had
no choice to make. The frontiers were bleed-
ing.âAn enemy, scorning peace, can be made
to forbear only .by chaftilement.:âThe war with
the Indians, which has continued ever since that
with Britain, iinpofes a heavy burden on the
people.âYet tire duties imposed will cherifli ma
nufactures, and encourage the railing of hemp,
flax, cotton, and various producfts of the farms.
The fuccels of manufactures is now put beyond
hazard, and the demand for raw materials will
increase that intercourse between the different
states, that mutual dependence and common in
terest, which every friend to the union will re
joice to fee.
431
~a
The alterations made in the excite law arc it,,
tended to conciliate the affa<Sions of the com
plaining part of the country. The rate of duties
holds out lignal advantages to the manufacture
of grain spirits. They will 110 c l'urely condemn
a law which affords to those who produce grain
who diffil the (pints and wlio consume them, i'i
preference, which considering â  lie duties on all
other spirits, gives them reason to delire the con
tinuance of the law, rather than its total repeal.
All America has a common intereit in the en
couragement of the cod-fifhery. The filhermea
as a militia by sea, afford a security to the ex
ports and imports of the nation 111 time of war
which is absolutely indispensable We have no
other means of effecting the fame important end.
The act for the encouragement of the fiiherv,
while it costs no money, will halten the naval
strength of America to a very early maturitv.
At length a mint is eltabliihed, and the coin
of the United Siates being itgiilated with accu
racy, we shall no longer be subject to the capri
cious changes of the foreign Itandard ; a copper
coin will be of no finall accommodation and lav
ing to the poorer classes of society.
1 he militia law will probably feeni a feeble
fy flem to many persons versed in military affairs.
The great difference of the militia laws of the
several slates is such, that fume will improve,
and ethers perhaps run retrograde in consequence
of this law of the United States. But improve
ments and amendments will be made from time
to time, and it is to be hoped tuat eventually
th is ail will not be one of the lea ft perf'etft parts
of the national system.
Of all the fubjetJts which have occupied Con
gress, none has been so fruitful of debate as the
, law apportioningreprefentatives. The conilruc
lion of the confHuition adopted and expietfed by
the President in his objccftions to a bill prefeiued
to him, finally prevailed, and has become a law.
âThe people of the United States have reafbii
to felicitate thenifelves that the difference of opi
nions in refpedt to apportioning representatives
turns on finallei- inequalities than any other na
tion has in its aflemblies.
The law for admitting the unfubfcribed debt
to be loaned, completes the system of credit, ex
cepting the proviilon for the state debts,which at
the next session many expeift to fee afTui'ned.
The humane purposes of Congress in favor of
the invalidsare in some roeafure thwarted by the
unconstitutional objections of the judges. Ie
'might be arrogant to express adoubt whether the
opinion they have exprefled be lound. It is
hoped the invalids will not be negleCied.
The table of Congress is still covered with bu
siness, Yet the people have reason to hope it
will in due time be dispatched, under the direc
tion of the fame national principles which they
have seen adopted thus far by Congress.
Some part of the meafurcs of government may
want wisdom, and some parts of the couutry may
want moderation and candor, but on the whole,
no nation hr.s prospered more, or enjoyed tran
quility in a greaterdegreethan the United States
since theeftablifhmentof the present happy con
ftitutionâandfurely none can look forward into
futurity with more pleasing anticipations.
Since government has a tight to pay off its debt in full propor
tion to its ability, with what propriety can it be said that the
debt is irredeemable ?
There is nothing which gives general, much lels nniverfal fatif>
fa&ion. Some complain of the administration of the new go
vernment, while they acknowledge the conditution to be excel
lent : Others conlider the system Â«s eirentiaily defective, and fav
that there is the greaieft danger of its imperfpttions being over
looked, in the wisdom and Iplendor ot its administration.

putatton oi the fcveral tracts of which it is composed, that
it will be found a more complete Tynem for the infttuaion of the
female world, than perhaps any other extant.
A volume* Hnder the present title, was lately puMilhed in Eng.
land and Ireland, and had a most rapid sale, having been puichafed
hv almost every lady "f taftf in 'hose kingdoms. To this volume
the editor has added Miss More's EssaysâMrs. Chapone's letters
on the government of the tamperâand Swift's letter to a young
lady newly married. These have confideiably enhanced its value,
and he doubts not, the ladies on this Tide of the Atlantic will be as
generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their ad
vantage as those in England and Ireland have been.

BLOOM SBURY,
THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in New-Jersey, occupied for many years pail by
the fubferiber; containing upwards of 200 acres of land, besides
a traÂ£l of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main ftrect leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the said ftrect on the east, and by the river on
the weft, forms a fquaie; which, from the combined ctfeÂ£t of situ
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the mcft
beautiful and desirable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, weli-fmiihcd brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very cxtenfive and pleaiing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new ftont
coach-house and stables, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining theft is a very complete granary,
rat proofs and a stone cow-houle, upwards of igo feel in length,
containing thirty-one paved stalls, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, See. Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is a gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich colle&ion of the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large asparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well
built, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheese-room,
spring-house, garden, See. a complete stone fmokc-houfe, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a rapacious ice-house, and every, other ne
ceflfary out-building. The ground is properly divided into small
helds, all well watered, highly improved, and chieflv under the
moil approved grass. This square has produced annuallv, for se
veral years past, upwards of lixty tons of the best hay, besides
supporting through the futnmer season twenty to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper fcafons
with great plenty of all kinds of fifh usually found in trcfti water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both of which
may afford a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whol of the land, except the wood-land, is inclosed and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar posts,
and rails of ch fnut and white cedar. The purchaser may have
the improved square separately, or the whole together, as may
best suit him. There is an inexhauftiblc quantity of good build
ing stone on the river shore. The purchase money, if well secured,
and the interest pundually paid, will not be demandtd for many
years.
Any pei son desirous of viewing the piemifes, may be gratifi d

or Mr. Inallman, who at prcfent occupies the farm-houleand
part of the lanoâand may know the price on application to the
