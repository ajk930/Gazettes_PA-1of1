REFLECTIONS on.th; STATE oj the UNION
" Si quid novifti re&ius iftis,
" Candidus imperti ; si non h>s utere mecum."
DISPASSIONATE enquiries concerning the
public iuteretts, are attended with salutary
efferts, in every time and in every nation. In a
country like that, which we inhabit, such exa
minations are unusually interesting, and may be
rendered, it is believed, peculiarly beneficial.
To create the disposition requisite to the pro
per acceptation of filch disquisitions, it is necef-
Jary to call to the public mind the variant cha
racters of the several states when the/were pro
vinces of a more extended empireâthe causes
â which produced that difference of characterâ
the means which were devised to increase and
perpetuate that variation, and the ends to which
those charatfteriftic differences were intended to
be instrumental. Refletftions duly serious upon
these circumstances will remind the people of
the several states, that they are natural friends,
whose amity and union have been too often view
ed with jtaloufy by rival eyes. They will per
ceive the wisdom and the high duty of cultivat
ing a spirit of mutual allowance and conceflion ;
anil a careful examination of their actual situa
tion will convince them, that greater bleflings
â will result from a perfect underllanding, and se
dulous cultivation of their intereftsat home,than
from almolt any arrangements, which the con
ceptions of foreign nations will probably lead
them to propose.
The consideration of our present situation and
of some interesting circumstances which have
grown out of it, is the object of this investigati
on, in which the benefits to be derived from a
liberal interconrfe with foreign nations will not
be undervalued. As no apology is neceftary for
such an endeavour, a miscellaneous enquiry into
several matters, which are always deeply inter
esting to nations, and into others which have re
sulted from our public operations, will be prose
cuted without further introduction.
Concerning the experts oj th: United Stales
It has been apprehended by persons ofobfer
vation, at home, and the idea has prevailed in
the councils of a foreign nation*, that the exports
of the United States for ihe year preceding Oc
tober, 1790, wete greater in value than could be'
expected again, by reason of the prices for grain
which were consequent on the scarcity in i ranee.
The exports of the fubfequenr year will aid us
in testing this opinion, which attracts the more
attention, because it is sometimes suggested that
agriculture and trade have been injured by the
ineafui'es of the government in regard to the pub
lic debt. The firft return of exports, on which
this conjecture was founded, includes a term of
thirteen months arid a half, and amounted to
20,415,966 dollars. From this aggregate value
a ninth partis to be deducted, to equalize it with
onÂ«J year's exportation, which reduces the funi
to 18,147,526 dollars. It is very well known,
that the price 9 of our produce through the vear
lately returned, and which ended with Septem
ber, 1791, had fallen to their antecedent rates,
and it will be perceived on a comparifoii, that
our exports exceeded in their aggregate value
tliofe ot the former year. The last return, ex
clusively of two quarters of Charleston, was
dollars 17.J71.JJ 1
Those two quarters, at the rate of the
correfpondlng term in the preceding
year, woald be about
There remains not, therefore, the least cause
to doubt, that our total exportatioiis wer4 eigh
teen millions and a quarter, and confequciitly
more than in the antecedent year. It is to be
obfeVved, too, that the high prices which' were
current through thetimeof thefirft retot'n,niuft
liaie : prbduced an exportation of all the grain,
that could be got to market, and none of the old
crop could have been left as usual, to fell with
the'neV. The obvious effect of this must have
fceen an unusual diminution of the exports in the
Lift yesir. The Valuation of the exports of these
ftatts immediately before the revolution is not
pretrftly ascertained : but {he whole exportati-

ons from America, including the remaining co
lonies, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and the Baha
mas, were computed to have been in 1771, dol
lars, 15,280,000. Jn these were comprised the
Ihipmerus between thole islands and the main,
and from province to province, as every veflel,
which departed from one American port for a
nother, was obliged to clear out her cargo, as if
dellined for a foreign country. It will appear
to be lafe to fubiract for the difference produced
by thele two circumstances, one half of the for
mer exports, when it is remembered that two-
thirds of the quantity of tonnage is employed in
the intercoufe between the various parts of the
present union, which is engaged in that with
foreign nations ; and that the British Newfound
land fifnery alone, was estimated at more than
2,200,000 dollars in 177 J. The increase of the
tonnage employed in the foreign trade affords a
nother proof of the increafement of our exports.
About 330,000 tons were laden in the present
United States in the year 1770, part of which
were deflined for ports now within the Union.
About 600,000 tons have been loaded in each of
the two lad years for foreign ports, though our
exports being in a much greater degree manu
factured, are now contained in a smaller compass :
and boards, fcarttling, and staves, which are our
moil bulky commodities, have not increased in
half the ratio of the tonnage employed.
An addition may be also made to the amount
of the return for the increased supplies in provi
sions, cordage, and other materials, for the use
and outfit of foreign ships. Since the prices of
fait provisions have been reduced below those of
Ireland, and many articles applicable to ships'
use, have been manufactured here, this item has
become very cotifiderable ; and so far as the ai ti
des are fold to foreigners, they are eflentially ex-
700,000
dollars 18,271,551

ports
Under this head, the increased number of ships
fold to foreign nations, may be fairly mentioned,
and although much has been said of the number
formerly disposed of abroad, it is not doubted
that a greater value was fold in that way in the
time of the last return. OfthisfaA fame fur
ther illustration will probably be given inthefe
quel. It will be fufficient to observe here, that
the whole quantity of tonnage built, and native
vessels repaired the lafi year, exceed in value one
million of dollars.
The enlarged confum-ption made within our
country by foreign perfuns of every description,
who are certainly much more numerous than they
formerly were, is as profitable to the country, as
thefame value in exports would have been. This
item will appear to be very conftderable, when
the expenditures of foreign niiniflers, consuls',
transient persons, fleets and seamen, are called to
mind

PARIS, February 6.
WHEN M. de la Jaille, the officer who went
to Brefl:, about two months ago, to up
on him the command of the ships de (lined to St.
Domingo, was attacjked by the populace at Breflt,
on fiifpicion of being an Ariftocrate, a National
Guard stepped forward arid demanded the honor
of being his executioner. By this artifice he got
poffeflion of hisperfon, conducted him to prison,
and saved his life.
M. de la Jaille was accompanied by his deli
verer to Paris, where they went together to the
King's mass. Being rliere pointed out to their
Majesties, the King said to them, lam sorry that
I have not about me the medal -which 1 have caused to
be Jlruck in memory of your gallant attton. ] Jhould
have felt great pleasure in prefentitig it to you -with
my own hand. The Queen added to the National
Guard, lam happy to fee you ; you have prefcrved
to the jlate a worthy citizen and a good officer. It
gives us pleasure to express our gratitude.
The following words were handed last week
to the President of the National Aflerjiblv : â
" Sit down'all the notes on the fame line, and you
â will have no miific ; place alt men upon the fame
level, and you deflroy all social harmony. The
billet was written by a beautiful Arillocriite.

Letters from Germany have been received at
Paris, which mention, that the Emperor haS of

Fi'ibourg or Brifgaw for his refideuce, and that

Madame the Duchess of Orleans inet with a
pleating proof of the consideration 10 which
her virtues have entitled her.âAt the meeting
of the Duke's creditors in the Hall of the Palais-
Royal, it was debated what annuity Should be al
lowed to the Duke. The sum was eagerly con
tested, diminished, and diminished again ; the
mod: trivial interests were dil'puied and refufed ;
contingencies and fractions were the fubjeifl of
quarrel and debate. But when the quettion was
Hated to the creditors, What income lliould be
allowed to the Duchess ? the cry was inftanc
and unanimous, " Every thing She chooses ; we
leave it entirely to her Highness ; let her name
it, we will sign before hand."
The architects emyloyed to arrange the saloon
where the Aflembly holds its fittings in a more

The Presidents armed chair and bureau are now
placed where the tribunal was fituared before,
the right hand is consequently become the
left, and we behold the Abbe Kauchet, and the
Briffotsand Ifnards, upon the bench which was
filled by Maury, Cazales and Malouet. The wits
make merry with the circumstance. They call
the Aflembly the microcosme. Thus, fay they,
in the great world, the King, who was at tho
top, is puttied down to the bottom ; the Attor

Curates are amazed to find themselves Bishops ;

LONDON, February 14.
M. Rochambeau, the fonof the Marlhal, lately
pronounced, in the parifti of Maubeuge, an eulo
gium on the valour and patriotifin of Bernard,
a private in the third regiment of cavalry, who
closed a long military career in the service of
his country. An officer preaching a funeral fer
inon on a common soldier could not fail to be
peculiarly striking.

A great commercial house at Bordeaux, lias
received a letter from a correspondent at Mad
rid, dated January 26th, stating that the inha
bitants of the capital of Spain are in a great fer
ment, and the Court in the utmost condo nation.
The occasion is dated to have been as follows :
Th# Corregidor of Madrid had given leave to
a Bookseller to print an edition of the French
Couftitntinn, on condition of printing but a very
small number of copies. Five or lix thousand
were, however, printed, which were inltantlv
purchased and carried off. N
Count Florida Blanca, the Minister, gave or
ders to seize the Printer, the Corregidor, the co
pies, and the buyers of the work.
This proceeding rouzed the indignant people ;
and it is alio dated, that the Minilfer paid- very
dear for his arbitraty rashness.
The letter concludes thus, â"Things are going

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY, March 27.
Sketch of the debate on Mr. Giles' notion, that the
Vrefident of the United States be r/quejled to order
an enquiry into the cattfes of the defeat of the army
under General St. Clair, ire.
MR. VINING enquired what was the objeifl
of the resolution âin what way was it to
be carried into execction ! for if the House is
not furniflied with some answer to thefc enqui
ries, he did not fee how gentlemen could vote
for itâHe conceived that this indefinite mode
of procedure would only embarrass the President,
without producing the desired effedtâHe was in
favor of a full and complete invefligation of the
bnfinels ; and if there has been any deficiency,
let those who are to blame be impeached j he
was not disposed to screen any officer from jus
tice, let him be of what rank he mayâbut he
was not fatisfied with the mode now proposed ;
he did not consider it as conflitutional or prac
ticable.
Mr. Boudinot faicl he was surprised to hear the
gentleman from Delaware express a doubt of the
practicability of instituting an enquiry into the
late unfortunate business Â»Â«the mode proposedâ
for his part, he saw no such difficulties in tlie
way, as appeared to the gentleman. Mr. Bou
dinot then dated certain complaints which ex
ited, and were currently reported-tfuch as a
failure of the contratfs, and for aught that ap
peared to the contrary, the misfortunes of the
army may be traced to that causeâother com
plaints are circulated, refpetfing which the pub
lic have a right to be fatisfiedâTheprefent pro
portion goes no further than a fiinple requestâ
Having fignif.ed the wifl, of the House, the Pre
lident may adopt such measures 111 relation to
the fubjeft, as he may fee proper.
,Mr. Giles supported his motionâHe conceived
that the enquiry was indispensable, and the mode
proposed ftritfily properâThe business mult be
g'n <Â»me whereâthis House is the proper source
as the immediate guardians of the public interest!
LEONARD BLEECKER.
(<â¢'â¢)
Mr. Viuing rofc to explainâhe dated various
difficulties which would impede the progress of
the bofinefs in the informal mode proposed
these, he observed, were so great, as to involve
an impoflibility of prosecuting the investigation
to any purpose.
He supposed that a more proper and conititu
tional way, would be to call on the heads of de
partments to give an account of their conducfl.
Mr Clark observed, that it was evident the
public mind was greatly agitatedâan enquiry
was neceflaryâlf the mode proposed Ibould not
prove agreeable or convenient to the Prelidcnt,
he will let us know it.
Mr. W. Smith observed, that this was the nrlt
instance of a proposition on the part ofthis House
to enquire into the condtufi of officers who are
immediately under the controul of the executive
âIn this view of the fubjeift, the resolution pro
posed could not but be considered as an impeach
ment of the condu<sl of the firftmagiftrate.âMr.
Smith then adverted to the division of the pow
ers of the government, expressly provided for in
the constitutionâGentlemen, said he, have dis
covered great solicitude to keep the branches se
parate and di(tin<st ; but on this occasion, from
the consideration that this House is the grand in
quest of the nation, they seem to discover a dil
poiition to go into a similar mode of condutf with
thÂ« National Aflembly of France, who spent a
whole night in examining a Drum MajorâHe
would not fay that they had not a right so to do,
but he believed no gentleman would juflify such
a line of eondudl on the part of this House.
He then particularized the several objerts of
enquiry in relation to the present bnfinefsâHe
{hewed that the constitution had made provision
in all the several casesâAnd as it was the duty
of the President of the United States to carry
the laws into execution, it ought to be (hewn that
he has been remiss in his duty, before he is call
ed on in this wayâHe noted the account pub
liflied by the Secretary of War, by ~ direction of
the President, and considered as his a<ftâAfter
several other remarks, Mr. Smith concluded by
faying, that in any cafe wheie it Ihall appear
that the Supreme Executive has not done his du
ty, he ihould be fully in favor of an enquiryâ
but till that was done, he trusted the meafore
would .not be adopted, without at least a previ
ous and full difculfion.
Mr. Williamfon said he doubted the propriety
of the resolution in its present form ; but was
fully of opinion that an enquiry into the expen
diture of all public money, was the indispensable
duty of this HouseâHe proposed the appoint
ment of a feledl committee to enquire and report.
Mr. Kittera moved to amend the resolution,
by substituting a feledi committee.
Mr. Venable was in favor of the original mo
tionâHe conceived that it was the only proper
mode of proceedingânor had he any apprehen
sion that the President would consider it as en
croaching in the smallest degree.
Mr. Giles contended that his motion was fofar
from tending to blend the several branches of go
vernment, that its effect would be the reverse.
Mr. Steele said he was indifferent as to the
mode, provided the business was fully gone into.
The gentleman from South-Carolina has menti
oned the report of the Secretary of War, and has
said that it is considered as the acft of the Prefi
â¢ dent of the United States. Mr. Steele denied
that it was the President's atflâit vras not fatis
fadtorvâwill any gentleman on this floor, said
he, fay it is fatisfatffcory to him ? He enumerated
leveral articles of complaint, and observed that
he had no great doubt that an enquiry would
lead to an impeachmentâJufticeto the public,
and thÂ« officers particularly concerned, loudly
demands an enquiry.
Mr. Vining here moved that the refolntion
should be committed to a feletff committee.
Mr. Boudinot objected to the idea of a com
mitteeâHe said the time would not admit of it
âwitnefles, said he, are perhaps 800 miles oif
what progress can a committee make in such a
buftnefs ? He denied that it was the duty of the
President to institute the enquiry unleis he was
requeued to do itâThe magnitude of the objects
of enquiry would involve such an expense, that
the President would not be juftified in incurring
it, unlets he was authorised by the House He
then Hated some particulars to ffiew the practi
cability of the measureâamong others, that there
were a fufficient number of officers present, to
form what is denominated a court of enquiry.
Mr. Barnwell \Â»as oppoled to the original mo
tionâhe considered it as informal, and suggest
ed what he considered as the pioper mode of
procedure, which was to call 011 the several offi
cers of government for such information in the
business as may be necefiaryâHe was againll the
commitment.
The motion for a felecl committee was rec3-
tiveU.
The Que ft ion then was on agreeing to the resolution.
Mr. Hiilhoufe j aid he believed this was the firft time that
it was e\er contemplated to appoint a Court Martial to en
quire into the expenditure of public monev.
426
. Mr. Fittfiraafts said he conceived that several parts of fte
refolurion were improperâHe thought that it was entirely
out of order to request the President of the United States to
institute a Court Martial or a Court of EnquiryâThe rea
sons and propriety of such courts- are better and more full*
known to the President than to the members of thfc Houfe__
Ho was in favor of a committee to enquire relative to fuchob
je&s as come properly under the cognizance of this Houseâ
particularly refpefting the expenditures of public moneyâ
and if the resolution should be disagreed to, as be hoped it
would, he should then move for such a commttee.
Mr. Baldwin said he had made up his mind on the fu! jestâ
He was convinced the House could hot proceed but bv a com
mittee of their ownâsuch a committee would be able to throw
more light on the subject, and then the House would be able
to determine how to proceed ; and if any failure 1 ad taken
place on the part of the executive officer-, he Ihould then 1*
prepared to address the President, and to request him to take
the proper steps in the cafe.
Mr. Seney advocated the resolution, and several ob
jections against a committee.
Mr. Hartley said as it was probable some degree rf odium
would fall on those who might vote against this refulutioftâ
he thought proper to give some reasons why he ihould vote -
g linft itâThese were similar to what had been ottered bv se
veral other gentlemen against the relolution, as improper and
informal.
Mr. Madison started some difficulties in the bnf.neft-eiie.
said the House ought to deliberate well, before they requefA
the President to do a thing which he had it not in his powSf ;
to doâlt was evident that the object of a court-martial or
court of enquiry, must be to elucidate facts which would re
quire the presence of officers, who could not pofliblygive their
attendance in season to meet the object of the resolutionâ ifc
added some further remarks, and then the qveftiori on the re
solution being put, it was negatived.
A committee was afterwards appointed.

Philadelphia, May 5.
â¢ T W Â°' P? rties Â» a correspondent, have shewn themselves
in the doings of the new government. One have evidently
thought favorably of a great public debtâwhereas the other
have viewed it as an evil, however necefl'ary a one.
So alio, one party have considered Speculation as the very
loul 01 public credit, and as the mark of ufeful enterprise and
turn lug wealth. Tile other, with a contrary eye, have viewed
it as the pampered child of an unruly avarice, and the prolific
paient oi idleness, diJlipation and fraud.
h urthSr, it has -been the endeavor of one party to work the
public d_-bt into an instrument for heaping up vast wealth in
the hands ot a tew, so as by the subtle efficacy of monied influ
ence, to divide and rule the many. The other have ltocd up
against this kind ot policy, as unjust aud unrepublican, and as
injurious to all the best interests of the country.
Again, one party have advocated the widest conftvuftions of
the constitution; so as to carry the powers of the government
far beyond the obvious intent and meaning thereof, and there
fore, beyond the grant of the people. The other have been of
a diiierent temper, and contended for a regular observance of
the constitution, equally where it limits as where it grants
powers, and for carrying it into execution in a republican spi
rit and manner.
Time and events have decided the controversy between
these two sets of politicians; and the public voice seems to be
pronouncing the decision.
It appears that a public debt is a public evil every way,
more especially in fucli a country and government like ours.
All parties now cry out for paying off the debt, as the greatest
of public evils.
It appears that speculation, which in its ardor, filled the
National Bank in one day, and has been kept intoxicated by
the spirit of that institution, ever lince; that speculation,
which has drained all the natural channels of bufinels, in order
to swell the mighty torrent in which it flowed; that specula
tion, which was born in extortion, has been nurled in the arms
of an ill-fated policy, and exhibits the features of its maturity
in baseness, in fraud and in swindling; it appears that this con
spicuous agent in our affairs, in place of the industry, wealth
and solid prosperity promised on one fide, has produced all the
extravagance, prostitution of morals, and devastation of the
true sources of a flourilliing situation, foretold on the other.
It appears, that the schemes for throwing magnificent
wealth into the undeserving hands of a favorite few, and for
undermining the great republican barriers erected by the con
stitution, have opened the eyes of the people, and is calling
forth the demonstrations of their general fan&ion to the strug
gles made by the friends of equal rights of constitutional au
thority and republican measures.
These seasonable iudications of the public mind are a happy
proof of the force of truth among a free people; and of the
ifure, though flow interposition of its authority to controul and
correct an elective government that does not conduct accord
ing to its true principles. This general indignation again#
schemes that might by degrees destroy the republican constitu
tion which binds up the people and states in one great free sys
tem, must be the more pleafmg to every friend of liberty and
the union, inalmuch as it Ihews the fame desire in the people
every where to maintain both, and that they all adhere to the
constitution as eftablilhed by themselves for that purpose, with
defined powers and a republican form. 'Abfc Gaz.
" Two parties, fays a correspondent, have shewn themselves
in the doings of the new government." One have evidently
thought favorably of public creditâwhereas the other have
constantly opposed every exertion for its support. The firft
have considered a public debt as a public evil, and have made
the greatest efforts for its reduction and final extinctionâthe
other have uniformly opposed every system that has been pro
jected; and while they have pretended to consider the public
debt as a necefTary evil, have devised no plan to pay it of.â
except by substituting one promise for another.
So also, one party early attempted to strike at the root of
speculation, by giving a fixed and prompt value to the public
debtâthe other by procraltination and opposition, kept alive
the objett of speculation, by the glorious uncertainty of legisla
tive deliberation.
Further, the friends of public credit, by unremitted exer
tions, attempted to place all the creditors upon a footing, by
making provilioji for all the public debts without diftin&ion,
and thus diffufe public justice to all parts of the union. The
other, by their opposition, were the occasion of the debts' fhift
ing hands, and thereby concentering a benefit among a few,
comparatively speaking, which in the natural order of things
would have been felt very extensively.
Again, one party have, with an honest independence of
mind, construed the constitution on that broad scale by which
every thing that relates to the complicated interests of a great
and free republic, just rising into national importance, ought to
be considered. u The other have been of a different temper,"
and contended sometimes for the letter, and sometimes for
the spirit of the constitution, where the one or the other
would serve to hamper and check the operations of the go
vernment, and limit its powers within a sphere commensurate
to their ideas of republicanism.
" Time and events will (in the history of this rising republic)
decide the controversy between these two sets of politicians,
and the impartial voice of the people pronounce the decision."
It appears that a public debt is an evil every way in
some, more than in others, principally in an unfunded way, as
our experience most woefully teftifierâbut in such a country
and government as ours, this evil is greatly mitigated, by the
consideration, that under the auspices of domestic peace, and a
steady perseverance in just measures, our resources to rid our
selves of the evil will encreafe with a rapidity which cannot
be calculated; for in this country, as a late writer in the
Gazette of the United States elegantly expressed himfelf,
TIME AND PROSPERITY TRAVEL TOGETHER.
It appears that speculation, which is ever on the scent in
every poflible dire&ion, whether in purchases of goods, public
bills, of exchange, lands, lots, &c. in its ardor, filled the
National Bank in one clavâand here had it flopped, all would
Ihave been well; for a speculation, built on the faith of a righ
teous government, cannot lailâbut though forewarned, suc
cess intoxicated the ad venturers ; and the enemies of our ris
ing prpfperity, taking an advantage of the moment, opened
; imaginary profpe<sts*, which terminated in disappointment and
.the ruin of many, while those concerned in the mifchief have
fallen into the ditch they digged for others. But the frenzy
was but for a moment, and induflry, recovered from her sur
prize, has learned a ttioft important lefTon, and is now turning
her attention to her former sober habits.
It appears that the plan for funding the publ
rated to the great advantage of thole \ ho be] â¢ â¢ ov
iftence of a principle of public juilice. "VYhile t
infidels on this occasion, parted with their e\ i

â¢bt has ope-
puohc debtâ:hÂ»s proving to their disadvantage, they never
can oe reconciled to measures which have proved propitious to
the fortunes of many whose judgements the complainants Lave
always been iu the habit of despising.
As a happy indication of the force of truth among a free
people, the public mind h more tranquil in the United Statej
than in any other part of the habitable globe, the peopls being
enlightened, justly appreciate the blefiings of" good govern
ment. Hence we find that the measures pursued in carrying
the new constitution into effe<ft, have received a very general
approbationâand the lolicitude of adminiltration to adapt the
laws to the wishes and wants of the great body of the enlight
ened citizens of the union, fully evince that the principle" of
aneleftive government pervade all its confntuent branches.â
Long may the people continue to enjoy and prize their repub
lican governmentâa government which is competent to their
security, peace and freedomâand may they ever discern the
just diltin&ion between such a government, and one that
leaves nothing for industry to hope, or villainy to fear.
