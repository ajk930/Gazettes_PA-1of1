FROM TfLE PENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE,
No. HI.
vft*ions on the Letters of u A Fa rmer,"
Add rifled td the Ycomunry oj ike United States.
THE charges brought by the writer of " The
Farmer," against the general government,
are Juch, as ought to attract the moil serious
attention of the people of the United States.
His words are as follow â¢
Had the cqnftitution of the United States
a fr ndation equally firm and equitable (with
that of France, to wit,) we Ihould not at tins
day witness the laws of the Union stained with,
44 1 ft. Mercantile regulations, impolitic in
theirfelves, and highly injurious to the agricul
tural interests of our country.
" 2d. With funding/)/?""', by which the pro
pel tv and rights of poor, but meritorious citi
zens, are facrificed to wealthy gamesters and
fpecnlators.
"'3d. With the eftablifliment of banks, au
thorizing a few men to create a fictitious mo-1
neV, hy which/they may acquire rapid fortunes |
without indujfcry. j
44 .nil. v/ith '?xci'o law*, which violate the
tranquilly of domestic retirement, and which
prevent the farmer from enjoying the fruits ot
his care ajid indi\ftry."
It mult be supposed by the yeomanry, who
have read the foregoing charges, that thr French
constitution had prevented the existence ot mer
cantile regulations, of a funding system, of a
I bank, of certificates, paper money, and bank
notes, and of excise laws, in that country. This,
however, would be another instance of the mil
takes into which " The Farmer's" pamphlet
would lead thole who confide in it.
The French have prohibited foreign built
ships from being navigated under their fiag, tho'
owned French citizens, they have prohibited
the ships of all nations from importing tobacco
into that kingdom, unless it was produced in
the country to which the ship belongs; they
have laid a duty of eight dollars per hogshead
on tobacco imported in any foreign fliip, more
than ifmiported in a French ship; they have
laid duties upon exports, which our confti tut iota
forbids, hcaXtft they would fall upon the landed in.
tercjl\ and, oj course, unequally, upon the great produc
ing Jlates; they will not permit the unmanufac
tured prc.\iwoÂ» r>fj?r*vrc+ nor HlSl2ofaftUTfiS
of France, to be carried to the French Weft-
Indies and colonies, in any foreign ship, nor will
they permit the produce of the Weft-Indies, or
colonies, to be carried to any place but France,
nor in any other ships than Ifaofe built arid Owned
in France, except the (ingle article of molafles;
they impose duties on foreign vefTels employed
in their coasting trade ; they give high bounties
to their filhing vefTels and flfhermen, and im
pose heatfy duties upon the foreign fifli, which
is necellarily imported by their colonial planters
and their labourers, to encourage distant fifhe
ries, ijpon the American coails, and elsewhere.
In short, all the principles of our commercial
laws exilt in the French system, and several
which we have rejected. They desire to main
tain a navy, and their national legislature deem
these numerous commercial regulations neces
sary to that end. Knowing they have the pow
er, they do not think it proper to be restrained
by the idea that the legislature of a free state
cannot (as " The Farmer" thinks) interfere
in the business of their citizens, without ipjuf
tice and danger. The National AfTembly know
it is often done with real advantage to the com-
inunity.
That the .French have a funding system, is
proved bv the feriojis fait that they pay annu :
ally, annuities, and the expences of
their 'government', fiie futn of one Imh'dred and
,ten mil/ions Â»j dollars.
In the early stages of their revolution, at
tempts -were made to reduce the public debt by
some ot the fcveral unwise means, which have
been frequently suggested in other countries.
The proportions were firmly and constantly re
jected, although the public debts of France, in
dead of being cor>tra&ed in an honorable strug
gle for free government, had been created by
the public and private vices of their kings, mi
nisters and courtiers.
The kingdom of France, like other European
countries, has at this moment a great bank,
which illues, as usual, its notes, or bills, as
every man, who undertakes to inform the peo
ple, ought to know.
Among the thirteen articles which compose
the revenues of France, an excise upon native
wines, spirits distilled from native materials,
and other produce and manufacturers of pre-
duce, is to be found. This is collected upon
them when they pass through or enter into the
towns, and amounts to near ten millions of .'dol
lars. They have also taxes upon the land-hold
ers, which are in proportion to the quantity oj pro
duce raised by them, and are therefore, in effort,
an excise upon the growth of grain, hiiy, wines
and fruits, upon the ratting of swine and cattle,
&cc. &c. They impose also, upon many deno
minations of tradesmen and manufacturers, a
tax for carry on therr-trade, which
(ipefate's as an excise on the articles they manu
facture, and is a v'ery great and general interfe
rence in the occupation s of their citizens. They j
have likewise granted bounties upoti the expor
tation of certain manufactures, believing that
[Whole No. 358.]
their pood tendencies in regard to the notional
interests render those grants in ionic inftariceis
clearly advifeable.
We fee then, by a recurrence to the conduct
of France, that the Nttional Afiembiy, in the
midst of their revolution and under that royal
or kingly constitution, which " The FaXXIk"
prefers to ours, have countenanced the com
mercial laws, funding fvftem, bank, and excise,
which were commenced by the firft, and com
pleted by the second legislature of the United
States in co-operation wirti our elective chief
magistrate. It would probably surprise " The
Farmer," and the refpe&able yeomanry whom
he addrelfes, to learn further, that the debts of
the states (or payi d'etat of France) have been as
sumed in that kingdom by the National Aflem
biy, to the amount of ninety millions of dollars*
Britanny and many other states of fiance were
so joined to that empire, that their union was
really a confederacy. It was seen, that if fhofe
debts remained upon them, they must each havÂ«
their feparatefinancial (yftem clalhing With each
other and with the National Afiembiy, and that
no feafibie or uirform system of finance could
beexpefted. Upon tbefe principles the Na
tional Assembly deemed it wife to a (fume them
to the iinmenfe amount already mentioned. â
This, it may be observed, has been reprefentcd
as the most unneceflary part of the funding sys
tem of the United States. But we find that the
wisdom of another free nation has led them to
the fame measure under similar circumflances.
It will be proper now to examine the com
mercial regulations of Congress as they affect
the agricultural interest ; and here the firft re
mark which occurs is, that the tonnage duty is
lower under the laws of the union than it was,
on a medium, under those of theftates. So that
at worst Congtefs have only continued an evil
in a smaller degree, which the Jiates commenced in a
greater. But let the duties on Imported arti
cles interfering with the agriculture ot'thecoun
try be remembered. These are so many boun
ties to the landed interest. The impost on beer
is eight c'etits per gallon, because we can employ
our own barley, hops and fuel ill the manufac
ture, that 011 common spirits is 24 to 28 cents
for the fame reason 111 regard to rye and fuel,
starch is dutied 15 per cent, bricks 10 per cent,
'cordage 180 cents, tallow candles 2 cents, but
ter, beef and pork 7-* per ci.i.t. cheele 4 cents,
coal 4J cents, cotton 3 cent*, indigo 25 cent-.,
fruits oMI kinds 10 per cent, glue, hair pow
der and wafers 15 per cent, coari'e iron work,
leather goods and hats 10 per cent, malt I*3
cent', marble fione and mustard 10 per cert.
fnutf 10 cents, manufactured tobacco 6 cents,
flax 7Â£ per cent, and hemp 100 cents, because
they are the produce of our lands or manufac
tured from them. Such are the commercial
regulations of a government, which ismifrepre
fented to the yeomanry as staining its laws with
injuries to the landed interefl!
[ To be concluded in our ncxt.\
FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER
Mr. Dunlap,
THE revolution now depending in France is
one of the mod interesting and important
obj-efts that has ever engaged the attention of
mankind. The glory or the humiliation of the
cause of liberty very materially depends upon
it. As men, anxious for the happiness of our
fellow men, it cannot but have engaged our belt
wilhesâas freemen, solicitous for the reputa
tion of f;ce government, we cannot but feel an
additional motive of concern for the eveht
as Americans, who gave the example to
twenty-five millions of people, we must find our
sympathy in the fate which (hall befall them,
heightened by something like a responsibility for
the influence of that example'âas individuals,
pofleiTed of sensibility, we cannot be indifferent
to the fortunes of thole individuals Who, having
diftinguilhed themselves in fighting our battles,
are endeavoring to procure for their own coun
trymen a participation in that freedom, which
they aififted in procuring for us. The good or
the ill fortune of La Fayette can never but
touch the tendered chords of an American
heart.
Aias ! how painful is the idea, that a path so
plain and easy, as that which lay before the
French nation, ftiould have been rendered in
tricate and thornyâa profpeft foÂ»bright and
certain, ihould have been rendered obscure and
precariousânot by the combination of royal
despotsânot by mercenary legions, threaten
ing them with the horrors of fire and sword (sos
these, with unanimity and vigor, could easily
be iVuftrated) but by a rash, fanatical, and un
principled faction, by a set of hairbrained en
thusiasts, played upon by designing knaves, who,
after having destroyed the public confidence in
the most enlightened and virtuous patriots in
the country, ahd seized the reins of power into
their own bands, are too unikilful .to manage
them with advantage, and too fond of dominion
to part with '.them. In the midtft of tempests,
that threaten to overwhelm their country and
themselves in perdition, instead of endeavoring
to calm, they ltill continue to excite the winds
and waves of sedition ; and, for a momentary
poflefiion of the rudder, appear determined to
devote the political bark to deftrnftion.
In contemplating this melancholyâthis asflirting feene, exhibited in another nation
amidit our prayers to the great Ruler oi tiie uni
verse to avert the danger which hangs over 1
to ftili the rage of fiftÂ»on âharmonise the
dilcordant councils, and protect, the hb;rty and
happiness of so large and interesting a portion
of mankindâit is incumbent upon us, as pru
dent men, and citizens, to de'rive trom it a o
leuin war.ung to ourielves âa lellori oi caution,
circumlpection, and vigilance, for
of our own conduct. , .... .
It becomes every reflecting man in the Uni
ted States, to alk himlelf this fcrious question,
are tliere not among us too many ot a cna
rafter exadtty similar & the men, who have
plungettjhe Affairs oi' Franc* into the -ejrtieme
dilorder aud kopardy, in which tiiey are now
inyoiyed.Â» Are there not men among us, who
feein difcon tented with every thing that bears the
semblance of regular 'and (table government.
who seem to have no other o'ject, than to keej
tfie cominunity in an unfettlfcd, convulsed, and
feverilh state ? who call all government tyian
..ny, reliftauce to constitutional and neceilarv
laws, patriotism, the friends of the law's and ot
rational liberty ariftocrates, conspirators, and
despots I who seem to think the business of go
vernment confilts in perpetual change ? that to
utt'i"o and to do we//, .are things of fynonimous
import ? and that the people can never be hap
py or fafe, but when they are uneasy and a
larmed !
If there are such men among usâfor. the love
of country, for the fake of peace, for the fake j
of every thing that is dear and precious to us
jis jnen, as fathers, and as citizens, let us be
upon our guard against their machinations, let 1
us watch them with eagle eye ; let us listen with!
â¢ caution to their'fmodth and deceitful tales; let
ijs withhold from them the means of doing mif
chief; let us put our confidence in those whom
we'tiave found the advocates for good
governniint and nor
p'rojtet'ty caii be fafe wTthout both.

FOR THE GAZtIfE Of IHL UNll ED STATES,
â ON THE BACKCOUNTRY RESOLUTIONS.
NOTHING is more common than to find
the word dafigns accompanied with the bed
proteilions; not because hypocrily pays Tome
respect to virtue, but because it secures a bet
ter reception to its seducer. Even a ragged
garment feeins to spare the blushes of a vaga
bond; but now and then a lunatic ch to in
sult the world in his nakedness. The authors
of the Pennfylyanis back country resolutions
agaimt the excise seem to disdain the little nice
ties of decorum, _and all the attentions with
which men in civilized life who have points to
carry usually attempt to soothe the feelings of
those who may be expected to oppose tnem.
Not feeling much refpeft for law and order,
they proceed in the firft instance to treat them
with the extreme of outrage and contempt.
They call those who ftiall attempt -to carry a
law of the people into execution loft to all fe'nfe
of virtue, unworthy of friendfhip and of the
conversation even of such persons as the authors
of the resolutions. They must be unworthy
citizens indeed whom the fomenters of armed
opposition to the law deem it difgraceful to as
sociate with!â-It is the pride of free citizens and
the charafteriftic of a republic that the laws go
vein ; yet those resolution makers who are
willing to put the lives and properties of their
brethren at rifle by combining the force of the
back country against the excile, hold it a dif
grice even to speak to such bad citizens as,
having no sense of virtue, woyld keep the sword
of rebellion 1,1 its scabbard, bv alfilting to carry
the ast into peaceable execution. We mav
judge how well they love liberty and whether
they undarftand what it is, by their declared in
tention to obftruft the operation of the law by
every legal measure. We hear of the maiefty
of the people, but did we ever know it more
grossly insulted ? Flying in the face of the peo
pie then "elves and most audaciously counlelline
refill anÂ« to their authority is not merely let
ting down goyernment, it 'is attempting to re
lax t.ie ties of society. The people would lole
411 power of acting as a body, and their forming
society would be labor loft, if their solemn ast,
or authority may be opposed and fcornfully
trampled upon as the authors of the resolutions
propose.

LISLE, July 17.
Some little justice has been done
here, ac length, to the alhes of the
unfortunate Dillon. A man, called
the &teur Vafleur, who was one of the
molt active and principal in attack
ing the ill fated General, and after
wards burning his body, was tried
lately,and condemned tolofe his head.
The sentence was carried into exe
cution on Friday lait,- ainidft an im
mense number of fpe<ftators. Heap
peared to be little affected at his ap
proaching death, and walked with a
steady step to the fcaftold, which was
erected precisely oti the spot where
the remains of the unfortunate Dil
lon, were con fumed to alhes.
Having ascended the fcaffold, he
addrefled himfelf to the furroitndiug
multitude, and said, with an audible
voice, << that at the moment of his
taking part against the deceased Ge
neral, he atfted under a persuasion,
according to the universal report 011
the occasion, that he had betrayed
the army ; and however he might
have since been convinced, that the
General was mifreprdfented, he, nt
verthelefs, frt>m the above-mentioned
conviction, at the time, could not
help considering himfelf, iâ fâ lne
measure, as a martyr to the cauf'e of
the nation. Consequences, he added,
might have shewn his zeal a miltaken
one ; but at the moment of his con
duct, he confulered himfelf as taking
a laudable part against one who wai
jeprefenred, and whom he then be
lieved to be a traitor."
He then submitted himfelf to the
executioner, who, by an apparatus,
new, at least here, and called a Lou
ifon, was decapitated in an inltant.
PARIS, August i.
The curious inanifefto of the Duke
ot Brunl wick has made little I'enfati
on on the public mind. Absorbed in
our more important affairs of a petty
broil jn the Champs Elyfeesâof the
great queltion, whether one of the
walks in the Thuilleries ought not to
be taken from the king for the amufe
nient of the peopleâof t-he frails of
142
the federatesâand of the conduct of,
La Fayetteâwe have no time to give:
to the 200,0c0 Aullrians and Pi nliians,
who aie ready to bur't into the king
dom. The Duke of Brunfw ick's ma
nifefto might perhaps have engaged
the actention of M. Briflbt, if a letter
of more consequence to French liber
ty had not come forili, viz. a letter
from the miniller of justice, directing
that foine allaflins who had committed
muider, should be pi ofecuted accord
ing to law. This inconteltable proof
of the treason of the court, engages
all l/is indignation, and he has nei
ther patience nor time to devote to
the enemies of his country !
Such, alas ! is the deplorable in fa
tiity of France at the present moment ;
and thus is the grand queltion of li
berty utterly abandoned. Do not
imagine that I fay this in the spirit
of party. 1 abhor thein both ; for the
intrigue, pride and obstinacy of the
Feuillants are perhaps no lei's difaf
ttous than the turbulence, lunacy,
and idiotifm of the Jacobins. Nei
ther of them will fuffer France to be
saved but in their particular way.
They will neither of them abate from'
their principle, though by their maiiir
tenance of it they fee the gulph open
to receive them. Can a man, who
like myfelf was a witness of the glo
jrious efferts of union in Americaâ
i who know from experience, that even
villi a tenth part of their resources
they would be invincible if animated
iby a common spirit, behold this exe
crable discord without indignation
My abhorrence is augmented when i
'fee that the spirit of the people is
iquickâiheir ardor unabated by all
'they have fufferedâtheir confidence
; undiminifhed by all that they fee.â
And that ihey only want wifdoin in
the legifla'ure,&artivity at the helm,
to direct their enthusiasm to its true
obje<ft. Ten thousand leven hundred
and fifteen volunteers have entered
themselves in eight days, and actual
ly set out yelterday for the camp.
These were provoked by no bounty,
110 enlisting money whatever was giv
en them,- âit was the working of the
constitution on their hearts, and fimi
jlar ardor burns in every department.
Some perlons efFe<ft to distrust the
authenticity of the tpa'njfefto, with
the Duke of Brunfwick's name, "it
is impossible," fays one writer, " that'
even this man who lives on human fa
crifice, should have publifyed any
thing so savage, and so outrageous as
this paper. That it was in the Bruf
fells gazette, is no proofâlt may be
the policy of Aultria, after having
committed their new allies, to make
them contemptible." A more sagaÂ«
cious and temperate Editor., enume
rates critical reasons fo\- disbelieving
it, and then fays,
" If after all it be true, that the
Duke of Brunfwick has outraged to
this degree the dignity and indepen
dence of a great people, who desire
only to be free, (hall not this cruel
affront rewaken in the fouls of French
men, the sentiment of National honor,
and unite all the spirits and powers
inj>ne central direction, which lhail
have the sole view of saving us from
the bafell of servitudes."

The Aiiftrians have again enteredthe French

commenced humilities againlt the French.
Coblentz is entirely evacuated by the emigrants,
who are succeeded by the Pruflians. Spain ap
pears resolved to support her neutrality in
ipe& to the affairs of France. âWhatever may
be the immediate ilTue of the invasion of that
kingdom, it is not to be imagined, fays an En.
glifh paper, that an attempt will be made to re
vive the old i'yftem of government, which, u.i-J
der Louis XIV. threatened the liberties ol
all Europe.âProtestant powets play a principal
part in the drama, and Protestants have cer

interested in the French fund"/, and a restoration
of despotism would be followed by bankiuptc),
which would be ruinous to them.

w Some perfens among us who have (carte any
other medium of political information but the
National Gazette,.have lately exprefied fomeap
prehenlions for the fafety of our freedom, and
the continuance of that national prosperity and
happiness which we now enjoyâ-yet I can scarce
ly beliere it pofUble for any artifice however in
genious, malevolent, or infreiotrfiy fpeckms to
deftrov the ordinary eiTeft of the evidence of
senses. Much,however, has been effected
through the medium of the pafnons, even a
gainst this* If any extensive i Yap region should
be made by this gentleman and his patriotic au
thors it must be by the afliftance of those cha
racters (some fnch there are no doubt in all pla
ces) who despairing of rising into notice and be
ing elevated to public trust in a more virtuous
way are led to attempt it in this.âAnd in this
pursuit they will no doubt profit by the history
of its success in all popular governments; yet I
do not fear but it will find its wings dipt by the
superior degree of sagacity which the people of
these States poiTefs lam happy that as yet
these dcteftabJe machinations have not been a

COMMUNICATIONS.
It has been intimated in the Nation's Gazette,
that there is a nece{fity for another revolution
inAmeriea. This is one of the most aftpnifh
ing ideas that ever escaped our hot heads. It is
a kind of madness that soars above Bedlam.â
What is the revolution to accomplilh? The go
vernment is already in the people's own hands.
Do these fanatics wish, by another revolution,
to have it change hands? The people being al
ready poflefled of all, these revolutionists can
on]y intend to set them down at the end of a
term of carnage and desolation, with less than
they set out with : more they cannot haveâin
thefcuflie they may lose all.âTho' a revolution
could not benefit the people, it might those who
bring it on. Those who own no part of the
cargo, by running the ship on shore, may pick
something but of the wreckâand ceVtalnly they
can lose nothing.
We hear a great deal from Che enemies of
our peace about the few ruling the many.â
They confiderthis as anti-republican. Yet they
ieein to approve of measures vÂ£ry incoiifiltent
with this principle. When a law, that is, the
will df'the mai:y, is rfefifted by the violence of a
few, tftey honor the perpetrators of the outrage
as men poiTcfling a true republican independence
of spirit. The insult to an exfclfe officer a*
Gennantown is with them an hopeful proof ot
what may be done. Are not the people insult
ed when their laws are refitted? Are not the
lives and the property of the many exposed to
extreme danger, when the laws, the barriers
that fence them in are thrown down ? If force
is to annul one law, will it spare another ? Those
who clamor against the excise, and encourage
resistance, are not republicans.

The man that has ability and reso-
lution to attempt rendering lolid and
endui ing services to his country, mull
often do it at the hazard of prel'ent
popularity. An independent decla
ration of the truth is attended fre
quently with the lots of friends in
private lifeâit is the charadteriftic of
party, that it Hatters whileit betraysâ
and in public life, the man who is fu

vantage will be taken of the lcarida
lous paragraphs published here, in
order to discourage the throngs of
settlers who are diipofed to cultivate
our forettsâlt mutt be confelied,
if these writers are paid by any fo
reign power to misrepresent and dis
credit the affairs of the country, they
are well entitled to their reward.
In proportion as the authority of the laws is enjore
ed, that oj powerful individuals is dmini/hed. In a
Jiate approaching to anarchy, the fenje and pro
perty* n.ho are the natural arijiocrats of ail Jock ties,
nji high aboz>e theirjellow citizens. Afeeble and
tottering government is ike mojl favorable to tkofe who
are in a condition to govern pay tiesâJ or in effect, at
such t:mes they govern the state. Individuals then
weigh the men having influence in pay ties en
gross all power. It is obvious therefore that equal
taws Jleadily evjorced are favorable to the body of the
people, on nhom they confer and to whom they fecuit
equal rights. 7he anjiocrais, the powerful individuals,
in that cafe fink down to the common level. The laws
regarding tights and not persons, they lose their ariflo
cratical prerogatives. These observations furnijh a
clue so underjland the complaints agcinji the laws oj
the United States. Being equal, andframed according
to the general voice, the rights oj the citizens.
But these fame equal rights cannot operate without a
bridging the arijlocratical pretenfiom of those who have
led parties in the fever alflates. It is curious to hear
the cry of ariflocracy begun by the very arijiocrats, and
addrejjed to the men who have lecoveied, members oj
a J ree the rights en which the complainers
had encroached. Look at the judicialfyjlem of the Unit
ed States ; is tkere in that, or any other law of Congref,
any violation of the equal rights oj the people ? Yet the
clamourers againfl the laws would lead one to suppose
that it is intended to wrefl fomt fragment if power
from government, to augment the rights of the citizens.
Nothing is farther jrom the purpose oj the clamourtrs,
or the natural course oj things. The observations here
tofore made willfhew that by enfeebling the laws, the
people will lose their proteflicn, while the leaders oj
parties, the natural arijiocrats, willajjume the power
oj them. Many cldmourers againfl ma\ Jeel
Jincere in their opposition, lecaufe they jeeb conjciou t
that they have funk as the laws have risen. Hut the
world need not now be told, at this Jlage of its political
fholarfhipi that an equal andfrm reprefentatue go
vernment, is the dtjlrudion of ariJlocrac\. It might
Ire indelicate to il{v/irate these remarks by vouchingjaffs
