HOUSE OF RthRtSF. ST AT IV F5,
FKJDAY, April J3, 1792.
A notion Jor recommitting the bill to provide jor raif
:"g a further Jum oj H6MC) jor t/ic piolctlion oj tut
trortiers, wa> made t epreceding day by Mr. Sage,
but not decided onâit wai thu dm ogam brought
Jorwtrd by that gentleman, who objened 0/1 the
-1 uLCtijIVH.
J RISE, Sir, to renew the motion which I
lii idjj veltjrd iy 7 that the bill bct'u, c you may
be recommitted. I ohierved then, that having
been reminded of my duty by gentlemen who
laid that they who had not brought a-ny ot-.er
plan of ways and means before the House, if
they objected to tl'at proposed by the Secretary,
'ad not done their d at;, I arose then to {hew
how far I had done inv dutand how far I was
wilHng to go to perform it. I informed the
houie that as I did not approve of the Secreta
ry's third plin (that which the house had adop -
Â«:d) X had proposed to the leading members (an
expreiiion which gave offence to foine gentle
men, but which I explained as meaning no more
than members who take the lead in biilinefs,
and to whom I confeifed my felf obliged for their
l'er vices, and whom, when they lead rightly, I
was willing to follow) an adoption of the Secre
tary s fecondplan, but not meeting with their
approbation, I then joined my friends in endea
vours to amend the biU; failing in tnis, and
called on to do my duty, I rife to move that
t.ie bill be recommitted. Had gentlemen, Sir,
done what t iey promised they would do, if the
home would apply to the Secretary us t.ie Trea
sury for a plan of waysar.dmeanr', Mould have
no occasion to make this motion. Ti.ey pro
mised that tiiey would freely and boidlyexamine
his report, and lilten attentively to every pro
position which could be opposed to it; but have
they done tnis? Noâtney embraced without
hefitatiort the third plan proposed by the Sec.e
tary, as if it were because he feid it was the
belt ol the three, without offering either of the
other two plans to the house, although the se
cond had been proposed by a member from Maf
fachuletts (Mr. Goodhue) before the house had
agreed to apply to Me Secretaryfor his opinion
I hope, therefore, that those gentlemen will
now agree to recommit the bill, that we mav
have an opportunity of trying whether one of
the two other plans propdfed by tne Secretary
or some other, may not be preferable to that
adopted in the bill; or, if not, let us atleaft fee
whether the plan which has been adopted mav
not be Amplifiedâfor there appears no shadow
of reason for repealing an ast fur establishing a
permanent revenue, to rc-enaft it in a bill for
raising a sum of money tbr a temporary pur
pose ; the business of a campaignâuorcan there
be-any propriety in passing a bill for the defence
of the frontiers, which is in fait a bill for the
encouragement of manufactures, and of the
j "!?>?"* *>r encrea( "ig the finking fund,
and also for the introduction of a stamp act.
If the committee of the tfhole will not adopt
the fijft plan proposed by the Secretary, I mean
that far difpufmg of the interest in the Bank of
the United States, which I confers I should pre
ti 'iÂ° , ylng t! f exc Â°ffive duties proposed in the
tnlro anu which are to be levied by the
Saturday, June i 6, 1792.

bill before youânor the second plan, which was
once so well recommended by t ie member from
Matiuchti iettsâat least I ho r >e they will limplify
t.ie bill, by itriking out what is foreign to its
purpoie ; t iat isj the repeal of the former rcve-
nue law; arid t'ie indirect intrcduftion of a
itamp act, fwe are to have a ltamp ast, and I
have no objection to one, let it be iutroduccd
{airly and openly, and {land by it e!t. For my
part, I think it a fufficient reason to recommit
the bill, to amend it so that it may lhew at one
view not only for what purpose the additional
duties arc to be laid, but what 11. y are. As the
- bill now {land ~ they are so blended with other
â¢ duties, that no man can fee in what manner
â  the sum wanted is to be railed. I know I (hall
be laid to be a bad financier, if I propose to fell
out our {lock in the Bank. I agree that the
Secretary's reason against felling now, when
{locks are so low, is goodâbut 1 know that 1
lpeak like the reprelentative of plain dealing,
honest republicans, when I propose rather to
Jell out their flock in the Bank, than to lav ad
ditional taxes on them, and encreale the duty
on imports to luch a degree as to introduce
smuggling, which mult be deftruftive eft eir
mora s, ruinous to their revenue, and which
may undermine even their manufactures, which
tnsle dur.es were intended to protect; for, as I
remarked on a former occasion, if \ou go be
yond a certain point in taxing imports, you will
tempt finugglers to introduce articles with
wilich they will underlell the fair trader and tie
manufacturer. I confels, however, that as we
have an interest in the Bank, which may be
ulelully applied to linking the national debtâ
I am willing to apply it to that purpo r eâana
t.iat I prefer the Secretary's second plan to the
one t e house has adopted. If the bill be com
imtted, I (hall be pleaded to find the committee
disposed to adopt that. By the plan now in tiie
bill, we are in the firft inilauce to borrow the
money wanted. Why, if we aie to lay an ad
ditional duty, may we not lay only enough to
pay the idtereft annually, and the principal tÂ»
installments? This, I think, must be much more
agreeable to our conllituents, than to pav the
whole sum required by taxes in one year. 1
fee not why we {hou d encreafe the duties on
imported articles lather tlr. n on tonnage. 1
think an additional duty on foreign tonnage, or,
it Gongre s have the courage to lay it, on ve -
(els of nations not in alliance with us, would
easily raifea sum for the dilcharge of the loan
neceflary on this occasion? and I am of opinion
that it is high time to encreafe the tonnage on
luch vcfl'els; it is more than two years fmce this
houle declared it would lay an additional duty
on the tonnage of veflels of a certain nation, jf
it would not make a commercial alliance with
our States. I know it is laid that such a niea
fure might impede a treaty; but, Sir, 110 na
tion upon earth has a right torefent fuchaftep,
nor can we be injured by retaliation. As to a
I treaty, I doubt much whether we Hand in need
of one. 1 fear the business of treaties is bette<
underftoodeifew ere than here, and that foreign
Ministers might be an overmatchfor us in fuc!.
negoeiations. I had rather regulate our com
merce, so as to induce th country with which
we wilh to trade upon advantageous terms, to
u<s such terms; at all events, I Ihould aim
at encreafing our revenue in this manner. If
we cannot extend our commerce, and at present
1 would avoid an encreale of duty on imports,
I think that the lands in the Weftem Territory
Ihouid be fold, and tonnage encrea'ed, before
we lay any further burthen on imported arti
cle'â i burthen which must be unequally felt
by the different slates. 1 hope, therefore, that
the bill will be recommitted, and so amended,
that it may pass by a great majority.
Mr. Hartley made foine observations in oppo

to which was negatived.

The family of our young lovereign

Archduke Ferdinand, Orand Duke
ofTufcany, arrived here yeltei > ly.
OurCoort havepuklifiied the whole
of the conefpondence wuh France,

1 be leafon for this publication is
laid to be, to clear our Miniltiy from
the wrong opinion which the Nation
al Allembly may enteitain of them,
uhen, in fact, the Jacobins are only
to blame.
The correspondence begins with
a letter fiom M. de Leflart, and ends
with the note from the Prince Chan
cellor, and indulges the declaration
of the present king, which is to the
following purport :
" That upon this fubje<ft he thinks
exadily as his predecettor, and fol
lows only the prudent rules of pre
caution, without any hottile intenti
ons ; that with refpeÂ«ft to further
steps he fliall be entirely guided by
what his allies shall think neceflary
to do in the present ltate of affairs.
That in the mean time he hoped the

MADRID, March aS.
M. Gardoqui is Minifterof L'Azien

at all pleased with the pensions and
rewards granted by the late Minister.PARIS, April 21
In the fitting of yesterday evening
the Aflembly, after having taken in
confideretion the formal proposi
tion of the King, declared war againlt
Francis 11. King of Hungary and Bo-
hernia
This decree was carried after a dif
tufiion of two hours, aim oft tiie
unanimous voice of the members. 1 lie
preamble, drawn up during the fit
â  inn by the Diplomatic Committee,
contains a fninmary recapitulation of
hose grievances, of which redress
could not be obtained by the means
of neÂ«;ociations ; and a declaration
that Fiance, having entered into this
war only to repel the attack of a fo
reign court, and defend its fovei eign
ty, will not cease to inanifeft its res
petft for the rights of nations, and
the laws of that universal fraternity
which it lias acknowledged in iis con
ftkuiion.
A deputation of 24 members was
appointed immediately to carry this
Decree to the King, in order to re
ceive his Santftion.
M. Condorcet proposed the plan of
a National Manifello, which has been
adjourned for three days, in order to
afford the assembly time for delibera
tion.
M. Forfaix has given a most favor
able account of the meaSures which
had been employed by thÂ« National
Treasury to secure for the Nation
those Supplies of real specie, which
may be necefTary to Support the ex*
penfes of a campaign ; and upon his
proposition it has been decreed that
the whole army fhnll in future re
ceive their pay in (ilver.
We need Scarcely add, that this de
claration of a war has given the great
ell Satisfaction to all ranks of citizens,
and may probably have the effect to
reconcile their differences, and diretft
th-Â»;r-force to a common objetft.
Extract of a letter from Vienna, April j.
" The allaffination of the King of
Sweden causes a great sensation here,
and no doubt throughout Europe.
This event, and its consequences,
mrtft cause a great altetation in the
proceedings of different courts, and
Sweden may be looked upon as Snatch
ed away from the grand confederacy
against France, as Ihe will find enough
to do to quell the discontents which
prevail within herfelf. What our
court will retolve upon is not yet
known : but it is generally believed
that a week or two will shew the joint
intentions of the Houses of Austria
and Prussia."
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, April 20,
In the fitting of the 19th, M. Du

Letter jrom M. NOAILLES to the
French MiniJlcr for Foreign Affairs,
April J.
S T R,
" Your dispatches of the 27th of
Marcfi were brouglit to n>e by the
Courier Derville, On the 4th of April.
I immediately obeyed the inftrudii'>ns
contained in them, by viliting the
Count Cobenzel, Vice Chancellor of
State and of Court. I preferred ad
drefling myfelf to him, because I was
sure, by his means, of introducing
whatever 1 chose to the knowledge of
the Sovereign.
" I said every thing to the Vice
Chancellor which could produce a de
finitive explanation, such as you wish
ed. I represented to him how much
our uneasiness increased every day.
upon observing t)ie hostile prepara
tions directed agqinft us.
[M. Noailles, after Tome similar
observations, concluded his address
to Count Cobenzel by faying, that he
had received orders o demand a de
claration by which the Court of Vi
enna Ihotild renounce its armaments
a;id coalition ; and to announce, that,
in default of this declaration, the
French King will consider liimfelfto
be in a (late of war with Atiftria, in
which he would be supported by the
whole nation, who willi only for an
immediate decision.]
" Connr Cobenzel undertook to
juftify his Court from the hostile
â views imputed to it, and contended,
that the reinforcements sent to Brif
gaw were for the prefervatior. of or
der. I observed, that so many pre
cautions, after the concert that was
known to us, juftified our alarms. I
in lifted especially upon the conclusion
of this concert: so contrary to what
we might expedt from a?t ally.
'' The reply of Count Cobenzel
confirmed me in my former opinion,
chat his court did not wifli to attack
us, but would make requisitionsâ
which it would be difficult to avoid
without a vuar. He laid, that the
concert: was no longer peffonally to
the King of Hungary ; that he could
not withdraw himfelf, but with other
courts ; and, that this concert would
continue till what remained to be fet
tled with France was brought to a
conclulion. He fpecified to me three
points
I. " That fatisfadtion should be
liven to the Princes poUcflioned in
rtlface.
2. " That fatisfaiftion fliould be
given to the Pope for the couiury of
Avignon.
3. " That the neighbouring pow
ers shall have no real'on for the ap
prehensions, which atife 1 from the
prefeitt weakness of the internal go
vernmerit ot Fiance.
" 1 nfked Count Cobenzel, if, for
answer to the representations-which
I had macle him, I'tnighc lay, that
his Court adhered to the official note
ofthe ioili of March. The Minister
perceiving bimfelf Surrounded by the
circle which I had drawn, said, that
he would take directions of his Ma
jesty, and inform me of what he
Uiould be ordered tp fay.
" M. de Bifcheffswerder set out this
day upon his return to Berlin. He
would have begun his journey sooti
er, buc that he waited foi a circular
letter, which will be addielfed to the
coalesced Courts, and probably to the
Slates of the Empire, as Co-States, de
manding from each the assistance ihat
they have propol'ed to give, either in
money, or men, in cafe of war.
" This, 1 am informed, was the
motive of his delay, but 1 haveno cer
tainty upon the fubjedt.
" M. de Bifc loffswerder will flop
at Prague to fee the Prince of Hohen
lohe, and agree with him upon the
time and placefor an interview be
tween the Auflrian General and the
Duke of Brunfwick. This interview
is expected to take place at Leipfic,
in the couifeof a month. Accoiding
10 this opinion, the Court of Vienna
has adopted a plan purely defenfive,
not wit hltanding the endeavors ofthe
Court of Berlin to fupgelt another."
Second Letter of M. Noailles.
" i have waited, Sir, for the an
swer of the Count de Cobenzel He
has just informed me, on the part of
the King of Hungary, that the note
dated March i 8 contains the answer
to the demands which I had been
charged to renew ; and that the dif
pofiiion exprefl'ed in tha: note could
be the less altered since it contained
also the opinion of the King of Pi uS
lia upon the'affairs of France, an o
pinion agreeing in all refpecfts with
that of the King of Hungary."
The President then read the sol
lowing letter from the King :
LETTER FROM THE KING,
" Mr. President
" I entreat you to make known to
the Aflembly that I shall come there
to-morrow at half pall twelve o'clock.
" LOUIS."
On Friday his Majesty came to the
Aflembly, the Members of which rose
and were uncovered as he entered,
and took their feats when he had
reached his place. The King then
spake as follows :
KING's SPEECH
" Gentlemen,
" I have come among you for an
objecft of the highest importance in
the present circumltances. My Min
iiler of Foreign Affairs v. ill read to
you the Report which he made to me
in Council 011 our fituaiioii with re
gard to Germany."
The Minilter of Foreign Affairs,
then went up and (landing by the
King's fide read the report, which the
King had notified to the Afletwb'y.
Minute of the Cabinet Council
of France addrelled to the KING.
"Sire,
" When you took an oath of fidel
ity to the Conftiiution, you became
the object of the hatred of the ene
mics of liberty. No natural tiecould

prevent their enmity. Your ancient
18
allies erased your name out ot the
lift of Despots, and from that mo
ment they forget your Majesty's fi
delity. The emigrants, rebels to the
laws of their country, are gone be
yond the frontiers to prepare a guilty
aggression against France. They wish
to carry into its bosom fire and (ward.
Their rage would have been impo
tent if the Foreign Princes had not
seconded and encouraged their
minal manoeuvres. The House of
Aultria has done every tiling to en
courage their audacity.âThe House
of Aultria, who fliice the treaty of

" The note of the 18th of March

The Cornwallis brings advice fiom Canton,
that a Hock vard, called the lianfale, belonging to

They concur in confirming former reports of
the orefeoce of mind (hewn by Gnftavus during
his i'llnefs. It appears, that, while he waited for
the arrival of his furgcons in an apartment ad join
ing to the saloon of the opera house, several of the
foreign ministers themselves, to whom
he said, " I have given orders, gentlemen, that
the gates of the city fnall be (hut. You will,
therefore, not take it ill, if you should be unable
to fend couriers to your courts, until after three
days. Your advices will then be more certain,
lince it will then probably be known whether I
can survive or not." H'S conversation then re
laced to the effects which the accident might pro
duce in Europe ; and the love of tame, which
was always his pre dominant pafiion, was percep
tible in his remarks. s
General Baion d'Armfeldt, one of his mod af
fectionate friends, entered the room, pale with
horror, and unable to utter a word. As he ap
proached, the King, ftretc.hing out his hand to
him, said, " What's the matter my friend ? Be
not so alarmed on my account. You know by
experience what a wound is thu> flatteringly
alluding to the wound which the general had re
ceived in Finland.
At eight o'clock on the morning of his death,

The reports in Stockholm were, that the con

persons all noble, refidmg partly in Stockholm
and partly in the provinces; and that the plan

in triumph through the ftrcets ; that lieut. col.
Lilienhorn major of guards, should immediately
take the command of the troops in Stockholm ;
that, when the public force was won over, the
constitution should be restored to the ancient prin
ciples of a limited monarchy; that the Prince
Royal should be entirely executive, and commit
ted to the national sovereignly."
The persons arretted are chiefly young men.
Several nobles, who were most forward in the op
pofuion to the King, but who were incapable ol
meditating h:s death, repaired to the palace, soon
after the attempt was known. The King being
informed that th<*CÂ»untMc Brahe, one of th fe?
was in an antl-chamber, making enquiries con
cerning his situation, desired that he might be ad
mitted, and said to him, u though he was undo
circumstances much to be lamented, he regaided
that day as happy lor himfelf, fTnce it had given
him an opportunity of reconciliation with one of
his oldest friends."
By a private letter received at Paris from the

of degradation and distressââbut certain writers
appear extremely solicitous to set us afloat*
again, that they may enjoy the pleasure of
wrecking the public tranquility preparatory to
a scramble among the ruins which their storms
shall have made.
If a majority of the Lcgiflature of the United
States, through four succeeding fellions, have
uniformly been oppofcd in their measures by the
wisest and best members, it follows that the
people are totally unqualified to exercise
most important of all republican rights, that ot
election.
What measure of government has not met
with oppoiition ?âlt is as evident as any objedt
of fcnfe can be, that however wife, honest and
patriotic, the minority is cow, always was, and
always will be, that the perfection of their sys
tem was to do nothing. This is certainly the
surest way to escape censure ; it is something
more, for the negative qualities of the minority
are always positive virtues, till they are unfold
ed in action.

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
FRIDAY, .MARCH 23-
' I'''HE Minister for Foreign Affairs
caced the Letter from the Canton
off Bern to the King:
" SIRE,
" The oldest Swift regiment in France .which
ha* remained invariably faithful to it* duty for
More than a century, and whose conduct has been
always irreproachableâthe Regimen: of trneit
has just experienced at Aix the molt crufcl of mif
fortuneS. Aflailed by numbers greatly superior,
retrained in its means of defence by the new
law which it had (worn too'aferve, and betrayed,
perhaps, by him whole duty it was to protect it',
the regiment was compelled to lay down its arms
In an open war against your Majefly's declared
enemies, ic w6uld not have Quitted them hut
with life. We will not diltrefs you, Sire, by de
tailing the particulars of the perfidy atrocity
which marked (his disastrous event, antF we" will
not attempt to delcribe to you the deep impres
sion oFgrief. which it has made on us and all our
people.
" Under theiVelfea-mftances we have but one
conrTc to takeâthat of recalling our regiment,
whose ferviccs can be no longer ufeful 10 your
Majesty.
" The honour of the regiment, and the pro
tection which we owe to it, oblige us to withdraw
ir from a country where the ti eaties on (he faith
of which it c.nne there, are violated with impu
nity. We therefore expect of your juflice, Sire,
that you will be pleased to give orders, that, af
ter redoring to the regiment of Ernest the arms
and the property of which it was despoiled by
an unjult and illegal of violence, a route may
be marked out tor it, by which to withdraw into
its own country.
" Deign, Sire, to call to mind thac our troops
have often merited the favors with which the
Kings your predeceflors, as well as yourMajefty,
have honoured the Swiss nation in general, and'
our Republic in particular.
" We will add no other motive for obtaining
thac this regiment may cross the kingdom by the
ihorteft, the inoft commodious, and the fafeft
road, and be allowed to leave it with honour.
" Constantly animated with the fame attach
ment, Sire, to your person, we fijall not cease to
put up prayers for your happiness, and that of
your kingdom."
The Arte in bly referred it to the Executive
Power to negotiate for the continuance of the
regiment in the French service.
Inconfequenceof newdifordersat Brie-Comte-
Robeix, which threatened to cut off the regular
fupphes of provisions from Paris, the Aflembly
authorized the Executive Power to station two
battalions of troops of the line within the dif
tance of their place of fitting prcfcribed by the
Conftiiution.
Tlie remaining articles on the fequertration of
the property of the emigrants were decreed
The Minister for the Home Department stated
that by accurate accounts transmitted to his of
free there was a fufficient quantity of grain in
the kingdom, or bargained for, to be delivered
at the fever* l ports, to supply the confmnptiou
till after harsefl, and that the only things that
could occa.ion local scarcity were foreftallinjj iâ
order to export, and preventing the free circa
