fOR THE GAZETIE OF THE UNITED STATIS,
MR. FENNO,
I HAVE been just reading the addrtfi of our il
lustrious Preiident, to tiie Senate and House
of Representativesâits communications afforded
me the highest pleasure, and I make no doubt of
its having the fame effetft on every friend to the
profperi'.y of the United States. Many are the
nnportant objetfts submitted to the consideration
of our genera] )f giflature ; but in my humble
opinion, the eftablifhinent of a National Milifia,
ought to be one of the firlt that ihould engage
their attention. The more I reflect on this fub
jet'i, the more I am convinced that a well regu
lated militia is the natural strength of a country,
and absolutely iiecellkry for its lafcty and p:e
fervatioH. A more pernicious idea cannot enter
into the heads of our citizens, than to imagine
that an institution of this kind is incompatible
with civil liberty ; for to remain without ;t, is
â¢the ready way to abridge the continuance of that
liberty, we have so happily established among us.
The freedom of every commonwealth mult be
protected ultimately by military force ; military
force depends upon order and dii'cipline ; and
without order ond discipline, even the gieateit
number of armed men are only a contemptible
1110b, that may be dispersed by a handful of ve
teran soldiers. It follows then, that our citizens
at large must submit to the ordinances of a well
regulated militia, or commit the protection of
their lives and properties to a diflincl body of
men, who will naturally in a short time, fee up
a profelfional interest, i'eparate from the commu
nity' at large
so this caofe we tngit attribute the subversion
if every free ltate that hiilory prelents to usâ
;he Romans were certainly the firtt and most glo
rious people that have figured on the-face of the
globeâthey cbntinucd free the longest : Â«very
âa- + foMicr, crstHj-foMfci lianie
but in faifl ; by which is meant, that they were
the moll rigid observers of military iultiiutions.
Let it then be the glory of every American to
hiye arms in his hands, with some knowledge
how to use them, on proper occalions, :igaii.lt
the enemies of his country : and let it lie efta
blilhed, as a point of honor, and the criterion of
a virtuous citizen, to pay the greatest deference
to the common and neceflary laws of a camp.
While I was engaged in thisfpeculation, 1 hap
pened to find among my papers, the Englifla Mi
litia La\v, and judging it might be of some use
in framing one for this country, I made an a
bridgement of the fame, which 1 have now sent
you for insertion in your tifeful and widely cir
culating paper, if you think proper.
1 am, Sir, your very humble servant.
INSPECTOR.

LONDON, August 31
On the 3d of January the Nabob of Arcot re
ceived a pistol fliot from ail unknown hand,which
carried off one of his fingers, and made its way
through his arm. His son-in-law was shot thro
the body. Tliefe alarming circumstances hap--
pened during a review, and are indisputably ow
ing to the army being kept (hamefully in arrears.
A worthy citizen, whose immeasurable capa
city has much puzzled many able calculators bf
the cube root, is now at Margate: previous to
his voyage, he was advised to avoid the fait wa
ter, and told by his physician, that immeriion
might thaw all his solid.i. A letter to his lady
he thus concludes :â" Maugreall their;nonfen
fical warnings, I determined td take the leap
and having, with no little difficulty,fqueezed my
/elf into ? machine, was dragged to the deep.
It is a prodigious fine thing, and such a help to
the appetite !âAs to their being amazed at my
bathing, ahd ajlonijhed at my stomachâwhat's
that to I ? One little fellow, I have silenced by
swearing: if he fays any more about me, I'll
stick him between two of bread and but
rer, and eat him up like an anchovy ; and as to
all their gigg about,my floundering in the water,
leaving a monstrous cavity in the fund, and the
devi! knows what, I think 1 shall silence them by
a little poem of my awn, which shall be in some
of next month's magazines. Thus it begins,
" Whrn in the flood I leap'd, the young whales gaz'd,
The dolphin fledâthe porpus wasamaz'd;
A shoal ot herrings made a quick retreat,
Thinking, agamft the chalky cliff they'd beat;
Plaice, whiting, maid, would here no longer (lay,
Crabs, prawns, and lobsterÂ«, backwards crawl'd away.
Thinking it a new isle, a foolifh gull,
Furt circling thrice around, dropt on my skull ;
While numerous wilks and lympets float around,
And think in I they a great rock have found.''
Thus do I begin, but after describing sundry
plungesâthus I endâ

But pass for an inhabitant o' ih' Tea."
DUBLIN, Augufl: 9
Thedifpute between Paine and Syeyes on the
great queltion, " Whether is Monarchy or Ke
publicanifm the better form of government,"
promises to alford much more information and
amusement to the world than political disputes
usually do.âThe queltion is one of the moil im
portant to the welfare and peace of mankind,
that could possibly be llarted. The ability and
precision of Paine, the accuracy of thought and
expielfion of Syeyes, admirably qualify the dis
putants to dilcufs it with effccft, and to prevent
the conceit from becoming what such Cornells
generally become a dispute about words.
Both of these proficients in the science of go
vernment agree in the outset, that " a govern-
inent by representation" is the only legitimate
one, and that no government is good, but i'o far
as it ii founded 011 this principleâWhat then
liuift be their opinion of that government which
rules over millions and is founded only on the
representation of a few thousands ? Would they
notâwould not every rational manâlaugh at
the ignorance or absurdity of him who would
call the people I'o governed a Free People !

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Fill DAY, November 4, 1 79 1
THE report of the committee on the memorial
of the fheriff of Suffolk county, in the state
of Maliacnufects, being called up,
Mr. Sedgwick moved that the house should ac
cept the report,viz. that a committee should he ap
pointed to bring in a bill, allowing to prifoneis
confined in any state, under the authority of the
United States, the fame privileges and immuni
ties as are enjoyed by persons confined under the
authority of t.he (late.
Mr. Livermore doubted whether the house Â«iad
a right to accept the report. Certain indulgen
ces, he observed, are allowed toprifoners in some
states, which are not granted in others ; and he
would alk, whether the house could eitabliili any
uniform rule for such cases throughout the United
States. If the indulgence was only granted in
conformity to the state laws, it would not be uni
form. He wilhed, for the fake of humanity, that
in every state there were laws equally indulgent
to confined debtors : aui were this the cafe, he
would chearfully concur in accepting the report.
But iince the cafe was otherwise, and tiiat the
adoption of the propoftd tneafure woultl establish
a fyftetn, not uniform,,he wiihed that the teport
should be referred to the committee, that was
proposed to be appointed, to bring in a bill for
the eftablifliment of an uniform system of bank
rupt laws; throughout the United States.
Mr. Sedgwick, several remarks in support
of his motion, concluded by expressing his hope,
that the house poflefled fufficient authority to
make such provisions in favor of unfortunate
debtors, itfelf dictated. He did not
recolledt tojhave ever heard so many disagreea
ble observations made on any fubjetit, as on the
confinement of prisoners' under the authority of
the United States, wbicjl was more rigorous than
could be the cafe Updtr the laws of the state
which he represented; ,
Mr. White was against the appointment of a
conimittee on this particular cafe, as it was one
of many, that wqnlct of coarse occur in the exe
cution of the judiciary system. He wilhed the
cafe in question flioold be referred to the com
mutee appointed yesterday, on the report of the
attorney-general ; and that every inconvenience
that might be forefeen in the judiciary system,
should as far as possible, be remedied.
Mr. Sedgwick having consented to withdraw
his motion, in favor of Mr. White's proposal,
The report was referred to the committee of
the whole House on the revision of the judiciary
fyltem, as stated in our last.
MONDAY, November 7
Mr. Baldwin, mernber from GeorgiaâMr. Afhe,
from North-Carolina, and Mr. Findley, of
Pennsylvania, appeared and took their feats this
day
A letter from the Secretary of the Treasury,
dnclofing a report and sundry ellimates, was laid
before the Ho use by the Speaker, which were read,
viz. lit. Ellimate for the year 1792.
2d. Estimate of certain liquidated claims 011
the Treasury.
3d. Ettimate relating to the Department of
War, for 1792.
Ordered that ico copies of the report, &c. be
printed for the use of the members.
On motion of Lawrance it was voted that the
Report and Estimates be referred to a feleift com
mittee of three membersâand Mefl'rs Lawrance,
Baldwin and Afhe, were accordingly appointed,
who were inlhuifted to report a bill or bills, ma
king appropriations accordingly.
A metlage was received from the Senate by
their Secretary informing the Honfe,
That the Senate have palled the bill allowing
further time for coinpleating the enumerationof
South-Carolina,with amendmentsâin which they
request the concurrence ot the House ; these a
mendments being read, were agreed to by the
House
A committee of enrolment was appowited, con
lifting of Mr. Bourne of Mailachufetts, and Mr
Smith of Vermont.
The report of the Secretary of War 011 the
petition of John Torrey, was taken into consi
deration ; this report was againlt the prayer of
the petitionâas the late Major Torrey died be
lore the expiration of the war, and leaving no
widow or orphans, his heirs are not entitled by
any law to commutation or half pay.
222
Mr. Ames observed, that Congress tlipuluic 1
with tlie officers ofthe army, that those Miic.i
continued in the service to the end of the \ VU:
fliould be allowed half pay for life, or commiita'
tion.âThe quelHon then was, whether fbj , r
Torrey had performed his part of the contract
in his opinion he hadâfor though the army wni
continued in pay till November, yet it is well
known tli3t hollilities had ceased before the pe
riod at which Major Torrey died. Mr. Atnei
further observed, that this was a cafe fu'i gcneri)
â that the application was founded i<i the ftrici
ell jurtice, and were he to determine it in a judi
cial capacity, he fliould be ks clear to deriJe i c
in favor of the prayer of the petition, as he fliould
in the cafe of a limple note of hand. He added
several other remarks, and concluded by a moti
on that the petition, together with the report
thereon, be referred to a fdect committee, in or
der that tlie principle for which he contended
might be fully difculfed in the House.
ivir. White opposed the motion for a reference
to a (elect committeeâhe mentioned several dii".
icnlties which mult occur in t!ie course of the
difculiion, on account of past detifions of Con
gress. The petition, laid he, appears to create
a debt which is not cognizable by Congress, as it
did not exilt agreeable to the adt of limitation at
the time of adopting the new Constitution. H e
said he fliould rather be in favor of a reference
o a committee of the whole house.
Mr. Ames observed that he considered the ap.
plication in a quite different light from the gen
tleman 1a It speaking. It is not a petition for a
grant from government âbut for the settlement of
a jlift account, and payment of a jtill debt, which
really existed prior to the organization of the
present government.
Mr. Boudiuot observed, that all the difficult'.-
in the cafe appears to arise from a difference of
opinion as, to the time when the war ceased.
This he conceived might ealily be determined,
by the period to which the army of the United
States had been paid and discharged.
Mr. Clark was against a reference to a com-
liiitee of the wholeâhe saw no difficulty in de
erinining the businessâbut if we go into a corn-
mittee of the whole, it will appear as if we were
fifhing for applicants. This has been called a
finale cafe; but lie believed, if the door was once
opened, we should soon find a great many like it.
He wished rather that the business should relt
where it was.
Mr. Williamfon said he was equally oppofedto
a committee of the whole, and to a JeleCC rcu<i.-
mitteeâlie was in favor of proceeding in ilic
usual wayâand coming to a vote upon the re
port. Congress, said he, promised that the wi
llows and oi'phans of those officers who died in
the service of the country, should be entitled to
half-pay for lifeâin the present cafe it happens,
that there are neither widows or orphans, but
some more dillairt relation who wants it. He
enlarged on the confufion which would be con
sequent on establishing a precedent like that pro
posed, and concluded by fayingthat he had heard
nothing fufficient to induce a deviation from the
line already prescribed.
Mr. Page was in favor of a reference
mittee of .the wholeâlor tho lie had an high te
fpetft for the opinion of the officer who had made
the report, yet if an individual member ot the
house fliould at any time express a wilh to have a
report from the head of any department what
ever difcufled in the committee, he fliould be in
favor of his being fully gratified.
A further difculfion of this fubjedt tool: place, .
the majority of the speakers, as Mefl'rs. Seagwic
Lawrance, Dayton, &c. were evidently in favui
of adopting the report.
The motion for a felecl committee was nega-
Mi*. Ames then moved that the repot: fliould
be rejected. f
This motion was followed by one for a reie â¢
ence to a committee of the whole by Mi. ,1(
worthâwho observed, that he considered the ap
plication as involving this quel.ionâ -VÂ» ietn
the heirs or representatives of every officer
died in the service of the United States, at..in
pei iod of the war, fliould not be entitled to co
mutation or half-pay for life. .
The question for a reference ro a commute

That'it would be inexpedient to repeal that part
f the law on which the pension to John Young-
W was founded. Some discussion of the fubjetf:

was eventually fupeiceded by a motion offered
bv'Mr.' enfon, to this effectâl liac the prayer
Jthe petition of sundry perlbns in the fta.c of
New-York, that lb much of a law ot the United
States as grants a pension to John Yonnglovc,
may be repealed, cannot be granted.
This motion was laid on the table, and the fur
ther confuleration of the lubjeift poUponed.
On motion of Mr. Thatcher, the report of the
Secretary of War made to the fir it Congress on
the petition of.Jofeph Tucker and others, piay
i,l(r compensation as agents to certain regimen.s,
last war, was taken into conftderation. This re
port was again It the petition. The fame being
read Mr. Thatcher moved that the report be re
iet'ted by the houseâand that there be allowed
lathe Paid Joseph Tucker and others, the Juni of
one per cent, on the amount received and paid
by them re('pe<ftively, including the funis grant
ed by the state of Mafl'achufetts.
Mr. Bondinot objected to this motionâhe sup
posed the proper queltion before tlife houi'e was,
Whether the report of the Secretary fliould be
agreed to, or not ?âThe motion, hp said, mvolv
ed'a partial decision oil a cafe which was by no
means lingular, as similar applications had been
nude to Congress. He moved that the report
fliould be agreed to by the house.
Mr. Smith (N.H.) enquired whether the amount
of the fmns received by tliofe agents from the
public, had been all paid over by then, to the
nfes for which they were received, and what was
the aiftual amount of their commifkons on the
funis paid. .
The amount of the funis received was only
mentioned in the Secretary's report.
Mr. Sedgwick observed, that the accounts of
the petitioners, it appears, have been fettled by
the le<*iflature of Mallnchufetts âand ihoiud the
motion be agreed to, it would lead to a revision
of all the accounts which had been fettled at that
period on similar principles.
Mr. Thatcher, in reply, said that his colleague
was mi (taken in refpeift to the accounts being let
tied, as Come of the parties had informed hmi
that they never acquiefeed in Uich settlement,
and would not receive the certificate tendered
them as compensation for their (ervices, as ltsin
trinfic value was much less than their juit demand.
The motion for agreeing to the Teport of the
the} of War being put, was carried in the
affirmativeâand Mr. T hatcher's motion was fu
perceded of course.
The Speaker laid before the house a report
from the commiflioners appointed pursuant to
the aift providing for the reduction ol the public
debtâwhich was read and laid on the table.
This reporr stated the progress made in that bu
finefs'fince the lalt account laid before Congiefs

SONNET.
To a ; vc r y eloquent> but bufc, FLATTERER.
There are a<Tts of bafenels and villainy which
while we contemplate their attrocity, appear so
great, that we can hardly persuade ourselves to
believe tiiat any of the human race are to be
found so depraved as lo perperrate tliem.â Among
tliefe we inay reckon the infernal machinations
of the incendiary, who to gratily a malicious dis
position, artfully and deliberately enkindles a
fire in the heart of a populous city, that may in
volve thousands in poverty and Wretchednessâ
but the villainy of the aflailin who lays .in wait
for innocent blood, who with a steady arin levels
the inltrument of death against the innocent', a
gaind a worthy man, an upright magistrate, a
friend to his country and mankind, mult be ac
tuated by a superior degree of diabolical pliren/y.
âSuch wretches there areâbut to the honor of
human nature, and of our country, the instances
are but few. Thiotigh the favour of a protect
ing providence this city has in a good measure
been preserved from the destruction that was
threatened by the attempts of the agents of Satan
âand we doubt not that vengeance awaits the
perpetrators of the cruel murder recently com
mitted in the (late of New-York.
In a free republic, the officers of the people
are entitled to double honor, because they have
no inheritance in their office, and when actuated
by just principles accept of public employments
from motives I'uperior to mercenary coniidera
tions. The crime therefore of individuals who
devise thedeftrut'tion, and imbrue their hands in
the innocent blood of foch characters, is tinged
with the blackest hue of hellish darkneli.

THE NEW-HAMPSHIRE CONVENTION
Mb. Holch,
WELL, Mr. Printerâas of late,
Convention fat in tree debate,
In order duly to revile
And guard our rights with eagle eyes,
To mend them wheresoever torn,
And patch in places fairly wornâ
1 look a feat on gallery-bench,
To hear the daily eloquence,
Nervous and strong as brais or iron,
And Iweet as comb in Sampson's iion,
Winch fljvv'd in Ciceronian ftiains,
From heads compos'd of tongue and biains.
The Bill ot Rights fir ft underwent
The chemic-force of pailiament,
Wheiein majority agreed,
That all mankind were Adam's feed,
And had an equal right by nature,
To certaingrants from God Creator;
This was the general voiceâtho tome
(Who prophesy of things to come)
Contended, tiiat great Nature's God
Had plac'd the governmental rod
In fav'rite hands, with power to use it,
In whipping rebels, when they choose it,
And plead their special reason lor'r,
Tiiat they are much the better fort,
By plastic hands much more rcfin'd,
As well in body as in mind;
Therefore, by reason mathematic,
God made a few aristocratic,
Willi full prerogative to rule,
No matter whether wife, or foolâ
It must be foâfor who (with cafe}
Can ftcm the current of decrees ?
Upon this easy ground 'twas urged,
That legislation might be purged
Ot every thukfculPd, muddy head,
Whose lining is compos'd of lead;
And that all pow:rol legislation
Be plac'd in men of penetration,.
Of whom ('tis afcertain'd of late)
'1 here are but Jixty in the State;
Who, if emp'iw'r'd with full commiflion,
Would legifiatc with expedition,
Make laws and things for simple sheep,
Morejuft, more gentle, and more cheap,
More fafe for any christian flocks,
Because they're always orthodox fâ
And furthermore, that kind of rats
Which some folks term ariJlocratSy
Will never biteâlike bugsâand fleas;
And fiily eatâthe public cheese.
It may be soâbut yetâpeihaps,
'Tis bell to keepâa caiâand traps.
The next atchievement, worth attcnti6n,
(Which felt the hammer of Convention)
Was that heroic coup-dc-main,
Whereby the Common Pleas were flail),
Condemn'd to end their wicked dajs,
By magic force of yeas and nays ;
So vicious men, for breach of law,
Once felt the weight of Sampson's jaw,
Which, tho devoid of tooth 01 marrow,
Was certain death as gun to sparrow. .
Well, when they'd kilrd these naughty courts,
Dame Fancy led to other sportsâ
As, changing minim fifh to flounders,
And making two-pound shot four-pounders,
Which, elevated two degrees,
Will overshoot the murder'd pleas,
And which, when fir'd across the trench,
Will lodge inr the Superiour bench ;
Whcrf justice holds her golden balance,
And weighs all coins, from mites, to talents.
Good lack ! thought I, what horrid stashes
The Couftitution feelsâwhat gashes
Are cut upon this great emergence,
1 o manifeft the fitill of surgeons,
Who sometimes busily are found
Creating a tremendous wound,
(The patient, dismal pain enduring)
That they may fTiow their art in curing.
Nextly, when each had done his best,
(This artem dreft)
A certain junto-cratick brother,
Dcelar'd 'twas best to make another
In some more noble tender part,
Perhaps upon the head or heart,
That when the fubjett's head is broke
By the atorcfaid random fttoke,
He must inevitably die,
Or seek for cure in chancery
Which ipjo JaElo lays the devil,
As stroking carries off king's evii,
And as by magic operation
It chancers down all inflammation,
Dispels the gout, the fplecn, and agues,
With many other pains that plague us ;
In short 'twill cure the deadly pthifis,
And bring about a sudden crisis*.
Thus while its friends laid much about it,
And swore we <?ould not do without it,
Other's decUi'd, with honest breath,
They'd rather die a nat'ral death ;
Would sooner clofc with grim disease,
1 han pay the chancellor his fees.
In fine, the code ecclcfiaftick,
Was fumbled o'er with fingers p l a ft ic k,
Which ach d and uch'd to form a fyft. m
Of new made thingsâbut could not twift'em.
run many curious propositions
Were made by zealous politicians,
And then presented to the chair,
Defining conscience to a hair ;
Which is, that tvery man and woman,
U heiher a Hebrew, Greek, or Roman,
?? be found, and good,
Must live on Calvinlftick food ;
hich, tho a most delicious huit s
To modâ yet some it does not suit;
sco that their (Vomachs heave and work,
Like fqueam.fti Jews at fight ot po.k !
However, viU, ungodly crew,
â J our vain pretencc will never do I
Molt CCTtainly you must be cram'd r
For he that doubteth must be damn'd !
But stay our catholick committee,
Perhaps youp dismal cafe may pity â¢
Thus meeklyâpatiently l> e merry,'
And wait th' approach of February,

MR. THOMAS, of Worcester, Maflachufetts, mod rcfpc6l*-
tullv informs the public, ihat he has this day completed the
Old and New Testaments of his Royal Quarto Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE. The Apocrypha and Index, See. will be finilh
ed with all the difputch the nature of the woi k will admit.
Such Gentlemen as hold Subscription Pa per s, he begs will
return them to him at Worcefltr, or to him and Company at Bojlon,
by the last day of November next, and as much foonci as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work lias been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highest approbation; both as to the execution of the
printing, its corrc&nefs, and iis cheapness compared with EnglilH
copies of the fame lize and quality.
As this verv laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
is carried on solely at his own cost, he is led to hope that all tbofe
who with to poljefs a large Family Bible, will so far encourage this
laudaUle undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
to the lubfcription,
