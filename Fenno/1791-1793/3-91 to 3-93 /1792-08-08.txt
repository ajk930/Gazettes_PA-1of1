Or\ tin ufti that max be made of Coutchouc*
Guvty or Indian Rubber, in Arts and Manufactures,'
an account of the manner of obtaining and md
nujacluring it.
(concluded.)
6th. A F.ROSTATION is now nearly at a stand ;
xa. but it is wonderful rjo one ever per
ceived the use that might have been made of this
substance for that purpose. No kind of silk, or
other light substance could ever be found, that pot
fetfed the fmaileft degree of elasticity ; by confe r
quence, when they afcendcd into thp higher Re
gions, the expanfioa of the gas was in danger of
buifting the globe ; it was therefore neceffarv t<j>
leave it open below to guard against that accident.
A globe of coutchouc would have polfeffcd the
quality here wanted ; it would have expanded as
the circumstances of ih? cafe required ; and while
it was perfe&ly to prevent the involuntary
escape of the fmaileft quantity, it would have adapt
ed itfelf in size to every variation of circumstances.
It is true, the retentive power of this substance,
when very thin, has nevei y>et been afcertaiijed by
experience ; but there is reason to believe it ii veÂ»
rv great. '
7th. As this substance is inflamable, and burns
with a bright/lame withoyt requiring ?ny wick,
it might be employed perhaps with great economy
as torches or flambeaux. Solid balls have also been
made of it, that are light, and of an amazing de
gree of elasticity ; but what ufeful purpose could
be made of these, does not at present appear It
might also be moulded into the foipi of riding
whips, and would probably answer that purpose
admirably well ; and after they wefe wore oy.t,
they might be employed aÂ« torches.
,Bth. As a material for chiryrgicpl purpofos, it
might be employed on occasions. Catheters (
have already been made of it, after having been
dissolved in aether, that have been found to answer
the purpose wanted, and to occasion irlueh less ir
ritation in the parts than those of wiy other fort
that have yet been tried ; but the great price, \yben
thjus manufafturcd, prevents them from cowling
into general use. The little bottles, when applied
to the breads of women distressed with fore nip-r
pies, can be so managed,.as to occa&on a more
gentle fufliou than fatf be any other \v?y,
and have therefore afforded v.eiy great relief. In
ftiort, the variety of uses to which they might be
applied, as bags for in jewing or 4or fucking", are
too numerous, to adm.ut of being there so much as
pointed at.
9th. Elajlic springs. In all cases where a fp,ring
is wanted to att by us contrflflijc power, no sub
stance can be conceived niore proper, than that of
which we now speak, especially in coid climates ;
and there are innumerable cases in which it might
be employed in this tnanner with the happjelt
effect, in various kinds of machinery.
10th. It is many years since Dr. Bcrgius at
Stockholm, made some experiment# on this sub
stance in Pa pita's digester : By fubje&ing ij in that
way to an intense degree of heat, it is said to have
beeaconvcitcd into a hard, eUftic, horn-ljke fub
ftrnce. I have not heard that these experiments
have been repeated ; but if upon farther trial, this'
fhajl be found to be invariably thercCult, it would!
extend the utility of this substance, far beyond the
limits we have hitherto thought of; but in the
state of uncertainty that at present prevails on that
head, it would be improper so fay more.
I might go on at this rate for many pages toge
ther, pointi/ig out varjpus other uses to which it
might be applied ; but J (hall content myfelf with
fpecifying one other only.
Geographical globes are at present an article of
ex pence, jMpecjalJy when of such a as to
admit of exhibiting a tolerable view of the earth'*
furfact. These could be ijiade of coutchouc of a-ny
size required, at a very moderate ex pence. The
favagesot America whom cuir philosophers repre
sent as destitute of every fTventaJ endow ment, will
teach us the way of proceeding.
Thd little bottles we import fropi thenccâ arc
formed upon mÂ®ulds of clay dried in the fun.
When the coutchouc has hardened on the furfacc
bv the process already <Jefcri.be(d, a little water is
introduced at the mouth of the bottjc, which gra
dually foftens the clay, and in time allows it to be
wafticd entirely out of it. A globe of clay might
be eafiJy moulded of any dimensions required,
leaving at one of the pplej a small protuberance for
a little neck. Tbis ball, when dry, might be co
vered wiih coutchouc till it acquired the thickness
required ; and lor the purpose here wanted, this
might be very thin. The clay miglut tiien be
washed out, so as to leave it empty. The re
mainder of the proccfs might be here defenbed.
were I not afraid of encroaching too much on the
patience of the reader.
It now only remains, I should give the reader
some notices concerning the uec U>at produces
this singular substance.
In no one instance that I knpw has the inatten
tion of mankind to ufeful improvements been
more conspicuous, than with reipedt to the object
of our present dilcuflion. It is not inudh lels than
sixty yeais since Mr. <le li Condamine firft jnnde
known to Europeans t,his lingular fubftauce, which
poflt*ff< s qualities that obviously render it one of
the mod uleful bodies that hath evei come to the
knowledge of man tor many important purposes
in life ; yet the culture of the plant which affords
it, has been, till this moment, entirely negleded
by every European nation ; nor do I believe, that
ever a Tingle feed of it was planted by one person
in the univcrfe.
Tbe tree which yields this juice is large and
(lately. Its trunk is uiually about 60 feet in
heigh, and from two to three feet diameter. It
grovs naturally in Brazil, in French Guiana, and
m Cceral other provinces of South America, and
alfou China, as it is fupjwfcd. It is called by
the natives liebea 4 mid Mr. A'lVrt has preserved
"that name. He calls h Hevta Qnvrnifis. It is iiie

charafleriftirs, will be veil underftooc 5 by the
; plate. Its feed is a nut, o c a pleating tane, veVv
! much resembling thatot a filbert, afifl ttiucb ettdefr)-
ed by the natives. The fee grows very freely,
?nd might doub l l { (V be eafijy reared, wsrc ieejds
brought higher for that purpofr, either in fame of
the focxy parts of our Weft-India islands, or the
Cape Verd lflands, or along the coafU of Africa,
where there arc such extensive tr?Â£ls of uninhabited
country Jaid waste by the depopulation tjhat ovr
deflru&tve trade in Haves occasions. What a dif
ference would there be in theftate of the inhabit
ants of that unhappy Country, were they to be
taught to cultivate the arts of pea.ee, and to .enrich
I thcmfelves by industrious labour, inftesd pi tharfs
I cruel wars fomented by our m.ifcrablc tr-ade in
Haves. Could this juice be had in abundancefo
near to Europe, it might He sent here in iVs fluid
state in clpfe cpfks or bottleÂ®, so as to br here ma
nufa&ured for the purposes it were fitted to au
fwcr.
Several other trees in phofe regions afford jui
ccs approaching to the nature of the routchouc,
though differing it in certain refpe&s, which
might be applied to other uses in life ; but an ac
count of thtfe shall be reserved for another occa
iion. ~

A RECIPE FOR KILLING RATS.
In 1783* a premium of fivegunineas was giv
en by the Dublin Society for the following re
cipe to kill Rats.
Take r quart of oatmeal, 4 drops of oil of
I grain of miifk, 2 nuts ofnux vomi
ca powdered. Mix the whole together, and
place it where the rats frequent; continue to
do so while they eat it, and it will soon destroy
them, be they ever so numerous.
Time, fays a late French writer, isuniverfal
property âto make good use of it, is the firft of
all riches.
Even those who poilefs nothing, have an in
terest to fee property protected ; for visible
goods alone, such as money, furniture, houfei,
lands, Set. are not the only propertyâthe love
of labor, induftrv, are alio filnds of which the
product is property; and this is perhaps th<?
moit valuable kind.ft

POLAND AND RUSSIJ.
DECREE OF the POLISH NATION.
rUBLISHKfr MAY 11.
AS the true basis of a permanent
Government consists in the com
mon care of all the citizens, directed
towards the general welfare, the da
mage and loss fullained in tonfequence
of that care, ought equally to be de
frayed by all ; so that the general
happiness of the country (hall form
the interest of each citizen, and the
welfare of each citizen the interest of
the whole community. Wishing thus
by the general tie of patriotic zeal,
for the common and mutual defence
of the country, to unire all the inha
bitants of the Polish State: We, the
King, with the coufent of the States
of the Diet, give the most folemti
guarantee, that in cafe of an invasion
of our frontiers by foreign troops,
t he devalhttion,and diminution of the
revenue, of the property of each in
dividual, the dil'pei (ton of the fanners
who are polfeiled of efferts, and the
loss fullained by the hostile burning
of cities and villages, wherever they
are fituaied, shall be indemnified by
a fraternal contribution of the whole
nation. For this end, after thecelfa
tiou of the war, there shall be ap
pointed and named, in the fir ft Diet
which fha!l be held, an extraordinary
commission for a just examination and
eflimate of the damage sustained.â
But teflifying this regard for good
citizens, we wish likewise to mark in
the strong ft manner, the difference
which exills between them, and the
degenerate sons of their country, and
therefore, for the present, determine,
that in cafe of an approaching war,
every native of Poland who shall be
convicted of a public crime according
to the articles of the law of Comitial
Judgments, or of an offence against
the law, entitled, Declaration with
refpetft to manifeftos, shall not only
be punished in his person according
to the sentence of the law, but shall
have his property confifcated to the
public Treasury, and there it shall be
preserved till the death of the crimi
nal, to form a compenfarion for the
damage above enumerated.

PARIS, May 2t.
To give an idea of the excefles to
which the hotheads are capable of
running, who exhibit every day at
the Jacobin club, it is only neceirary
to peruse the journals of that society
of the 20th of May. It will there be
feeu, that M. Manuel, conviifted, not
of adding a wreath to the civic crown
of Mirabeau, but of laying hold of
Tome of the inanufcripis of that great
man,which belonged only to his heirs,
has endeavored to divert the public
attention by the most serious denun
ciations. What he said at the Jaco
bins on the 17th of May, follows:
" We still want men of tbei4Jh of
July.âTrue we have enemies on the
frontiers ; but the nioft dangerous are
in the midst ps Paris; and perhaps
the tribunals wiflito effeC't a counter
revolution, and begin to follow she
footfteps of the tribunals of inquifi-
tion
" Is it possible that the woman, who
can mod injure us by her character,
her influence and intrigue, is not in
sulated during the war. She iliotild
withdraw to the Val de Grace : there
(he would enjoy chat protection which
is refufed to no citizen. It is tijne to
repeat in this society those important
truths, which, in the brighter days,
formed the spring of their aiTuqps."
That is, that this man has beien so
bold as to propose to separate' the
Queen from her hnlband ; and this
!iicredible piece of advice wag ap
>lauded ; âQuoufqus tandem.. ..,

May 19.
This day a Juflice of the Peace for
the quarter of Henry IV. named La
riviere, was brought before the bar of
the Afl'embly, for breach of the privi
lege ofthree members, MeU'rs.Chabor,
Bazyre and Merlin.
The sentiments of the AlTembly
were much divided on the occasion,
and violent and tumultuous debates
took place, which ended in absolute
disorder.
It appears that Carra, in his paper,
had announced a plan for carrying
off the King, and had spoken of it as
a certainty ; he in it invited clubs to
meet daily ; and endeavored to per
iuade the citizens to found the alarm
and fly to arms. The Justice, in the
line of Ins duty, iflued a capias again ft
Carra. to learn his proofs of this hor
rid confpiration. Carra said he had
bis proofs from MeflVs. Chabot, Bazyrc
Â«*ric Merlin. It then, he conceived,
was his duty to examine these ge.ile
mew ; and firft made a conftitutiknal
application ro the AlTembly to this ef
teft, who decreed to pas* to the older
78
of the day, declaring that the course
of justice should not be stopped.â
They had accordingly been- brought
before the justice by a capias and ex
amined. This was termed a breach
of privilege, and the julVice finally
ordered to be sent to Orleans to (land
his trial.
May 20
This day the decree which fends
Justice I.ariviere to Orleans, was final
ly parted.
The committee of jnfpedion from
whom the proofs of the exigence of
an Auftrinn committee were said to
come, were called upon for thole
proofs, and Mr. BriUot, one of its
members, promised them in 3 days.
May 26
Two letters were received from the
winifter of war ; one gave a Jill of the
names of the officers of Royal Alle
tiiand, Bercliiny and Sase, who had
deferied* and the other was cxprefled
in'the following terms :,
" Moniieur I.e l'refident,

The letter enclosed a letter from
M. dÂ« la Fayette, containing an ac
count of the action at Florennes.â
M. de la Fayette dates the number of
the enemy to have been double that
of the French ; that within two hours
after the atftion, the French were in
'pofleffion of the field of battle ; and
concludesâ
" I cannot pay too high encomiums
to M. de GouVion, Crillon, Lalle
mande, Defrttottes, De Gatile, Ga-'
zotte, "Vicftor de la Tour-Meubourg,
Blandeau, Chatnpelloa, De Malcourt,
and our other officers, subalterns, and
soldiers. For five hours that the ac
tion laded, not one 7iian quitted the
ranks; they prefervecl silence, cool
ness, and all the courage of the mod
experienced soldiers.
" I have r/sinforced thedetachment
of M. GouvionâThe enemy have not
appeared again.

tliree are officers; and 93 wounded,
of whom five are officers."

The fitting of this morning com
menced with another account of the
action at Florennes, agreeing in all its
circumflances, and equally honorable
to the soldiers with that given by M.
de la Fayette.

on the throne by the Prince of Wales,
and Duke of York, received graci

On Sunday the Lord Chancellor
had an interview with the king, at
St. James's, after presenting the ad

The proclamation tells us, that in

their neighbours of being seditiously

The foregoing "was thought neceiTary to jus
tify tiie Secretary of State from falfe imputa
tions refpedting a supposed patronizing or influ
encing t.ie National Gazette. As to what more
particularly concerns myfelf, 1 ih.lljuftmention
piiefly, that the clerkihip of foreign languages
U not anew eftablilhment in the department* of
State, but has always been occupied by fomj
person in another fixed line of bulinelsâas, for
inltance, Mr. John Pintard, of New-York, who
held it for years ; the faiary (two hundred and
fitty dollars per annum) being of itfelf inade
quate to the maintenance of any man, that is
capable of performing the duties of the office,
and who should make his sole dependance there
upon.
... But, I would ask, why is tlie Editor of a
Newspaper difqualiiied in a greater decree than
a perion in any otlier line of bulinefs,from hold
ing the above place under the department of
State -or, what pollible reai'on can be given
why the Secretary of State fliould be laid under
tne neceliity cf translating, any more than the
Secretary of the Treai'ury-fhould be obliged to
L"' or n i -y laborious duty in his owrt office ?â
The ablurdity is too great to bear examination.
An artful design to mislead, could only have
tnat the political complexion of-the'
Natipnal Gazdte is at all influenced by the triflin"
1 alary in questionâor could have held up an
Â»dea, that if the salary did not exist, the princi
ples of the Gazette would be in any refpeft dif
ferent from what they are.
The " American," in the performance al
lucled to, sets out with an affected ferioufiiefs of
allertion, that it was necellary the whole truth
fliould be told. It is now left to the public to
determine whether the whole is not a lie ?

tive on the 2 [ft Mayâthe Minister of France
at the Court of London, lent an official note on
the 2 4tii of the fame month, to the British Se
cretary of Stateâ which contains the following
Â°Â°frvations : u Tne roval proclamation puh _
11 onjthe 2 Ift of the present month, and com
municated to the two houses of parliament, con
tains some expressions, which appear (no doubt,
contrary to the intentions of the BritiHiminif
t'.v to give credit to the erroneous opiflions*
which the enemies of France strive to "propa
gate, relative to the intentionsofGreat-Eritain.
II individuals of this kingdom have enter
ed into a foreign correspondence, tending to ex
cite tioubl&s; and if. as the proclamation seems
lo lnlinuate, some Frenchmen have joined into
tneir views, this is a circumstance unconnected
witii the French nation, the legislative body,
til .- King and his ministers ; it is a fact entirely
unknown to them, entirely repugnant to all the
Principles of justice, and which, 011 being ITiewn,
will bs universally condemned throughout
France.
A new system of military regulations for his
army has been published by M. Fayetteâfeveral
ot the articles are (evere. Whoever within
reach of the army breaks iilence is to be put
i:i iron for fix yearsâmarauding is to be severe
ly puniflied, also harsh treatment of prisoners.
Death is the punifiimentof any soldier who cries
out, we ate cut ojf, we are betrayed 9 or any thing
similar. No man in command is to be question
ed for a&s of icverity which are neceilary in an
engagement. Officers are fubjeft to double
puilhinent for any fault they neglect to repress,
or ariy act of disobedience to which they give
way. The Camp of M. de la Favette, it is said
favors very little of the pristine 'dehcatejje of the
French armiesâevery oificer being obliged to
.follow the example of the general,by being night
and day in the camp.
The Hessian troops on the Rhine form a Cor
don of 15,000 men, and are on the war efta

Baron de Golt, Minister of Prussia, with the
Austrian and Ruiiian charges des alfaires were
to leave Paris about the last of May, it was said
without taking leave.
The King of the French has dire&ed prose
cutions to be commenced against the inflam
matory writers in Paris.
Patriotic gifts continue to pour in from all|
quarters. The author of the paper entitled
I'Ami du Rot, M. Royou, died the 2Dtii May.
The publillier of the paper entitled I'Amidu peu
/'/t*, remains invisible ; his highly inflammatory
writings continue to dilturb the metropolis.
The Duke ot Deux PontS, a German Prince,
appears determined to preserve a ftrift neu
trality. Numbers of the Regiment Roval Alle
mand Huilars, of Berchiny, who had deserted,
return daily.
Monsieur Bourgoing has been received at the
Court of Madiidas French-Minister; this is
conlidered as equivalent to a formal recognition
ot the new constitution on the part of Spain.
The funeral ceremony of the unfortunate vic
tims of the firft defeats of the French troops,
has been celebrated at Lille, at the public ex
pence, in the Church St. Etienne. The Em
l>refs of Russia has publiflicd a manifesto in the
Ruffian Polish and French languages; this was
delivered to the Polilh Diet on the 18th May,
in which (he declares her determination to take
part with those opposed to the revolution of that
kingdom, to endeavor by force to restore the
ancient constitution.
That she may be disappointed in her ambi
tious views is mod devoutly to be wiihed ; the
Poles do not appear di'poled to revert to theii
former state of vaifa;a ;e.
They have accordingly taken measures tol
defend their countryâand have resolved by a'
public editÂ°c, that whoever futfers by the inroads
of the enemy fnali be indemnified by a fraternal
contribution of the whole nation.
The King of Spain has ordered eight vefTelsi
to be fitted out at the port of Cadiz for the pur
pose of exploring the coaits of the Spanilh pof-l
sessions, in order toenable them to form an atlas
for the benefit of navigation.
The English' papers contain accounts of a
number of skirmishes on the frontiers, between
the Auflrians and French, with various fuccels.
None of them appear to have any important
afpeft on the great objedt of the war.
Two persons, after being tried and found
guilty by the criminal tribunal of Paris, have
been executed for forging the Affignats.âA
Neapolitan frigate lately chafed two Algerire
velTels into the road ofCavalair, close to tie

The King of Prulha has difmifTed alf'the French
who had employments about his Court, especi

It appears that very great fermentation has
prevailed in the National Alierribly of France,
occasioned principally by aifertions, that-an
Austrian club existed in Paris, who were deter
mined to carry oif the King; and, by a motion,
to diilolve the King's body of guardsâthis mo
tion, after a tumultuous deba e, was carried.
The guard was henceforward to be compoled
of national troops.
M. Brilfac, commandcr of the French King's
body guard, lately dilfolved, is in a state ofaccu
fationâthe English papers fay the guard was
jdifbanded without consulting the King.âThe

which has been formally announced in the Na

I peace and tranquility of the city of Paris being
perfe&ly restored, the National AUembly have
declared that a permanent fitting was no longer
necelfary, and have directed that the Mayor of
Paris discontinue his daily reports. âThe sala

AfTembly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at
75,000 livres a year, about 3200 guineasâthe
other Ministers at 50,060 livres.
A journal is npw publilhed in Paris, which
dates the late occurrences in that capital as hav

June, a squadron of four velTels failed from Lis

The Republic of Geneva is putting herfelf in a
posture of defence against what they cali the at

to repair to the army, and there join his two
Pons, has been induced to lay aside his intention
at the instance of the French Miniilers.âThe
National Alfembly, on the 24th May, after much
debate, decreed as a measure of public fafety,
and of general police, the transportation of all
the nonjuring Clergy, under certain regulations.
âR.iots on various pretences have taken place
in several parts of England.
Monday last the Supreme Judicial Court of
the United States met at the new City-Hall, in
this cityâprerent, the Chief Juftics and the
whole bench of AiTociate JudgesâBusiness of
Sreat importance it is said is pending.
Letters by the Brjtilh Packet fay, that affairs
were going on well in F.ance, and that ex
change between England and that country was
fifingâ which is a sure indication of the public
opinion being favorable to the cause of liberty
in that country. That Poland was actually in
vaded by RufliaâThat affairs in Ireland ap
peared to be drawing to an interesting crisisâ
that the Catholics in that kingdom were now
demanding those rights and privileges which they
have heretofore prayed for.
I The late BÂ°fton papers mention several par
ticulars as the rel'ult of examination, which
'render it highly probable that the project of a
[grand Canal from Connecticut River to Boston,
is practicable.
On Thnrfday morning was witnefied a very
melancholy event at Mr. Henry Ki-ser's powder
mill, in lower Merion townihip, Montgomery
county, between the hours oi" nine and ten
There was a large quantity of powder in the
mill, which by accident took fire, and blew up
with a great explosion, which was heard at
Schuylkill ferry, and was there supposed to be
an earthquake. Mr. Kizer, and three others,
.who were in the mill, were blown to pieces;
and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a co-partner of Mr.
Kizer, was so badly wounded that his life is
d-'fpaired of. A young woman, who happened
to be near the mill at the time it blew up, had
both her_ legs broken, and was otherwile very
much iujured, by one of the rafters, which was
carried from the building by the violence of the
explosion.

That the light, of liberty may always Ihitie
with meridian IpJencior on tfreie fret; ftatec,
and that this light may enlighten every m;n
that cometh into the world" âis the Wifhofeve
jry friend to the human raceâbut, that tii:;
maybe realized, it is of indiJ]tensab;c neceiiity
that the minds ot' the people Jhoiikl be lviaoc
tranfparent toreceiye trte < elelft'al invigorating
raysâand this again ctepetieH on educationâ
li thel e are not adequate mcalimes adopted to
give the great body of the people a competent:
portion of knowledge, to enable them to unuer
ltand and prize the bieflings-of freedom ana Â£Ood
government, Liberty will hardly deicend to tl,e
third generation.
That must be an extraordinary government
indeed, whole measures, without any excepti
on, receive indiscriminate approbation âand
that must be an extraordinary epoch in the an
nals of mankind, which produces a race of men
who are perfectly fatisiied with the conduct of
those who are intrusted with the management
of their public affairsâBut the grumblers have,
almost without limitation or exception, con
demned the administration of affairs-âThey
it is true, of disapproving of Jotie of the mea
suresâbut where are we to look for their ap
probation ?
The real friends of liberty, who are the
friends of tranquility and good order, could
point out many things in the government to
which they have serious cbje&ionsâFew of the
me a Aires which receive their approbation on the
whole, are entirely to their mindâbut as pa
triots and good citizens, they do not clamor a
gainst what they disapproveâSome thin- ; they
know will be corrected by time, experience,
and the good ienfe of the peopleâothers trey
think will be found either impracticable or in
juriousâand will of neceflitv be altered or done
away.âlt may be therefore fairly inferred from
the different conduit of the two parties, that
while the latter are for submitting the opera
tions of the government to the tefl of experi
ence, the others are inceflantiy employed ill
attempts to bewilder the public mind with ideas
of their luperior patrioti/in, integrity and in
formationâto create suspicion and jealousy,
and to four the disposition of the people.â
Whereas, to judge from the pajl to the future,
and taking principles and charuilcr into the ac
count, there is not a person of candor and intel
ligence in the United States, who will fay th2t
the profpedls of our country would be brighten
ed, by a general change in the administration ;
for though it may be possible that there are better
men in the United States than tho.'e now em
ployedâit may not be l eceflary to fay that a
certain Junto are not the meii.
