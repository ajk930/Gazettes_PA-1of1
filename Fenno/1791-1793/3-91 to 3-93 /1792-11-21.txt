ibme comments on the relative pretentions of
tii) e who are said to be competitors lor this
important ftarion. TW? trait in the execu
te department of our government, k. among
the in oft important of tho e which diftinguifli
it from the monarchies of Europe ; and a ; its
prefervatioa must in a great measure depend
upon the political cond.ict of thotp who till it,
a candid enquiry into the characters of the
competitors becomes a matter of public right,
it belongs to a free people to guard thein
ftlves from injury ; and to this great principle
the forms of ceremony or conipiaifunce for
persons must, upon all occalions, yield. Even
the competitors, therefore, however puiniul
the scrutiny be, fliouid console thei'i
felves under the reflection, that upon the pie
fc.'vatif" of J 1 "? prirciplp, t ' â¢'f'C- r *
country depend-.
Ia particular circles several gentlenen have
been ipoken of for the office in queliion, but
at present all others seem to be withdrawn
from view, and the conteU to reft fol-ly be
tween John Adams, Elq. and Governor C'i.i
ton. To their comparative ni-' its, therefore,
as the only competitors, I flxu.ll confine thele
observations.
Tt> treat of them in the affirmative line'
would be useless, as it could lead to no {atis
fa<fÂ£ory conc ufiou j for every perion will ad
mit that, in fomc'refpeet , they both poflels
the requisite qualifications 'â¢ that both, tar in

their country. To fix the preference, ttieir
merit i mult he viewed from a different ground.
The oi.jeftiyns which apply to each mult: he

To Mr.' Arijin; it iias been o j 0â¢â¢â¢Â«', f.ut

and common*; and that the allegation is true 1 ,
it is to be pre fumecty will not be controverted.
Hi; writing*?, eutitled, '* A Defence of tne
American Constitutions," and u DMcourfes
upo;i Davila," fully demonstrate it 11 it
could be supposed that doiihts ex.fied upon
this point, extracts from tho'e publications
ihould be now furniflied ; they lHa.ll however
immediately, if any intimation of the kind
be given. And to Mr. Clinton, an objection
of a different kind, âhis oppoiition to the pre
sent constitution, before its adoption, has been
urged. These, I believe, are the principal ob
jections made to either : they are, howeve r ,
tuofe ouly upon which I lhall make a: y com
ijienc. TÂ» whom, then, does the Wronger one
apply? On who e political principles, at the
present moment, would the good people ct
fchefe States with greater propriety bellow
their fancti >n ?
To form a found deciiion upon this inter
qaeftion, two ot iers, on which it de
peÂ«di, lHould be previously fet'led. First,
which of these gentlemen's political fenti-
IBSilts wander f,ifrom t"ie present coi
ftitution; atfcf fecundly, -On which liJjÃ does
greater danger lie, in the progrefi of the
jpjvsrtnuent, ot' a;i undue inclination towards
the fori 1 ! preferred !>y Mr. Adam 1 ;, or that as
cribed to Jtr. Clinton?
WithVefjwft to those of Mr. Adams, it will
be readiiy perceived, that they depart, in all
the Â£ieat o'itl : i;from the present contti
tittiui. The eltablilhmcnt of a government
of king, lnrdi, and commons, would entirely
fjktjvert the present one, which rests on the
frÂ«g (bifrage of the people. Two d: Ain ft or
ders with hereditary rights, would be erei'ted
tbe.n, and they reduced to a limited por
tion of authority only, forming a kind of ba
lance against thoie higher and' hoftite orders.
With refjÂ«cl to tho'e of Governor Clinton,
It is to be oblerved, .that they have always
ranged within the republican theory. * His
nuxi:r\ has b?;n, to V Â«ep the government, in
all its department-, eifentially connected with
the people. The question about t '.e consti
tution involved only a modification of this
principle. Beside it it to be pre fumed that
ilanv of it> o':jsCtionr,:Jiave been done a. ay
by the amendments ; fothat, in fact, it must
be deemed, ii. ail its part", a", nearly corres
pondent with his own theory, as the contra
riety of feat intent, always displayed on a fub
je;cl of such importance, could rcafonably ad
mit of.
The chanatfteiifcic difference, then, in their
political principle fiinply amounts *to this,
that those of Mr. Adams varv radically from
the constitution, in the main features of the
repub ican fyftcrn ; where a* the e of his com
petitor harmonize With it in that elTential
point. In addition to which it is of mpor
tance tx> observe, that upon the eftabli Oilment
of the Constitution, and prior to the adaption
of amendment Mr. Clinton's Oppofitioirccaf

vent, Mi. AoÂ«us Iris, in the discourses above
aUtided to, endeavored, by all fchea#gunifcnt<>
in his power, to inijpire, in t-ie mine# of hi-;
countrymen, a difti uft of a government iouiyl
ed on the people alone, and to prepare them
for the gradual introduction of hereditary or
ders in tlife State.
i.t'. â¢ h < >
In regard to the other quelhon, on which
fide does the greater danger lie, 0) a more
probable inclination towards the fybvcr.ion
of the republican fyilem, by the introduction
of a government of an higher tone, or too
great a relaxation of it-? principle, I am
persuaded that 110 peiTon can feridu/ly enter
tain a doubt 011 the fubjeft. He must be lit
tle Skilled in the political balance, and the true
complexion of the times, who fuipcfr s in any
degree, a preponderance of the latter evil.
That the government may (land on : .tr pre
ient ground,- is certainly the wish of those to
whom a contrary sentiment has been attri
buted : for Jet the objections of those who
were opposed to it, where opposition was
made, be examined, and it will be four
the space v/hich separated the body of the 3y-
r ~:-; i. . . : ... - ..'l. ..w. ; . Â»
row one.âThat, in fact, the difference in ma
iiy mftaaces, was but trifling, and that this
has been generally accommodated by the a
mendments. The. truth of this po lit lon h s
been so well eftabiifhcd by events, t : iat to
doubt it, argues a mind so inveterately blind
ed by prejudice or interest, that the force of
truth canuot reach it. No danger the- ot a
vibration back need be apprehended ; fÂ«j, in
truth, no person \vti flies it. O;; the other
handi it must be admitted, that the evident
tendency is in the opposite direction. A par
ticular enumeration of those me afu res which
contribute to give this bias, is ut present un
nccelf.iry, and would certainly, in their de
velopement, exceed the bounds of tbefe ob
servation:.. lor the truth, however, of the
remark, I beg leave to appeal to the judg
ment of every impartial and well-informed
American.
If then, the good people of these States wifli

publican tone to the American cliarafter,
that might tend to preserve their liberties
forever No confide ration of local attach

On Thursday morning the 20th,
M. Servan announced to the Nati
onal Aflembly, thJlt he had received
a difpacch from M. Duinourier, dat
ing that the several detachments ex
pected had joined his army ; t hat he
was, at the moment of wi icing, equal
in force to the enemy. That he had
under his command 70,000 men,
12,000 of which were cavalry. He
fuys, that the whole army had de
manded the punishment of therun
aways; that he had deprived ihein
of their uniforms ; he doubts not
but that there are many in his army
foldtothe enemy ; but that the Lite
executirtns he has made, will keep
the reft in their duty. That his ar
my no'.T is ardent to engage ; aiul
he concludes, " what may I itot
hope to do now, when I have been
able to rcfift the enemy with infe
rior forces ?"
Mr. Rules writes to the miuirter,
that the invasion of the French ter
ritories in the department of the
Lower Rhine, is reduced to a mere
nothing.
The Auftrians remained only a
few minutes in the village of Berth.
The peasants who favored the inva

the tribunals.
After these letters had been read,

LUXEMBURG, September 11.
We are informed from Clerment
in Argoune that a detachment of
Pruflian Huflars, consisting of 100
men, having yesterday attempted to
pass through a wood, near that town,
was suddenly surrounded by 900
French, who had concealed them
selves among the bushes, with 4 pie
ces of cannon. On the fir ft dif
charge forty of the Huflars were
killed upon the spot, the other 60
cut their way through the enemy
with their sabres. A body of troops
fufficient to surround the wood,
were instantly ordered to march,
and succeeded so well in their en
terprize, that not one of the French
escaped ; four hundred being killed,
and the reft taken prisoners ; the
Prussians loft only one man.
Part of the army of the Princes,
having Monsieur and the Count d'
Artois at their head have quirted
the camp of Hetange, near Thion
ville, to join the army of the Duke
of Brunfwick, near Verdun. The
Prince de Hoheulohe has marched
for the fame purpose, with a great
part of the Austrian army under
his command.

13 R U S S E L S, Sept. 18.
On the nth, the army under the
command of General Count Clair
fayt. having quitted the camp of
Romayne, went and took post on
the heighths which command Bari
court Befancy.âThe head quarters
*ere eftablilhed at Nouach. Apart
of the Pruflian army, which had
been encamped in the environs of
Cierges, made a movement almost
in a parallel direction to that of the
army of General Glaii fayt.
Next morning the two armies di
rected their march pall Befancy, to
wards the post occupied by the
French troops, a detached body ef
whom engaged with the Pru'ffian
column ai tl>e entrance of a wood.
The Austrian army having then
formed in order of battle, made
some movements, during which the
enemy di(appeared, so that only a
few piquets of hollars and chafieurs
were able to engage in light fkir
nnflies with the dragoons and ad
vanced pofls of the French army.
The lattet-however, attempting to'
wards evening to fall back upon the
right of our army, were prevented
by a company of chafleurs, support
ed by cavalry, infantry and artille
ry. The badness of the weather
and the darkness of the night pre
vented any further opeiations.
On the 14th in the morning, M.
Duniourier attacked us at the port
of Roux aux Birs, with about 6000
men ; but our troops defendedthem
felves with their ul'ua] bravery, and
that port having been reinforced by
two battalions and two squadrons,
the enemy were repulsed with con
siderable loss, and obliged to pass
the river Aifne in the greatelt dif.
order.
The advantage which we have
gained by this affair, cannot com
pel) fate for the loss we sustained in
the death of Prince Charles de Li(|Qe
colonel of the engineers', whose
excellent character, military talents,
intrepidity,and great adtisity,makes
him juflly regreted, hurried on by
the ardor of his zeal and courage,
he marched forward with a
men only, towards the enemy's ar
tillery, and was killed by a bullet
(a cartache) which unfortunately
struck him.
Our loss besides consists of 4 offi
cers wounded and 30 rank and file
either killed or wounded.

This country continue! to i><*
drenched in blood ; and the Â®eni
us of this once polished people,ftems
to fuffer a gradual deterioration ;
their cruelty exceeds belief, *nd
they every day give new and (hock
ing proofs of their ingenious baiba
rity. In my lad I had occasion to
mention an order of the National
Afleinbly,for transferring the State
Prisoners from Orleans to Saumtir :
ihe banditti of Marseilles, whom
the sanguinary chiefs of the capital
sent to escort them, received and
disobeyed the legislative and muni
cipal mandate, marched on to Ver
sailles, where they arrived yeftsr
day, with their devoted vidiimsâ
they led them in great pomp tiro*
the principal streets, until they
came exactly opposite to the War-
Office, where, dreadful to tell ! tkey
put every loul of them to death,
without even the formality of a
mock trial ! the prisoners, fifty
three in number, were all either
Bifliops, Dignitaries of the Church,
or Officers in the army.
The ruling faction in Paris has
intimated in writing to the Duke of
Brunfwick, that his attempt to ap
proach the capital lhallbe thefignal
for murdering the King and Queen
of France.
Letters from Barcelona state, that
five fail of French (hips of the line
were at anchor off Nice the 24th of
last month, for the avowed pnrpofe
of bombarding that place on thefirlt
movement of the Sardinian troops
to join the confederate army.
Advices received yesterday from
Frauce mention, that it was rcpjrtÂ»d
that the Duke of Brunfwick bad en
countered the French army under
command of Dumourier in a gene
ral action near Chalons, and obtain
ed a decisive victory : near 10,000
of the French being said to be cut
to pieces. War was declared by
Spain against France on the ad of
this month, and Meff'rs. Rubi, Alva

be his Catholic Majesty's Generals.
Sept. 27. A letter from Verdun,
of the 17th September, fays, that
General Glairfayt has put Dumou

his post with only t 7,000 men, rho'
Dumourier had 22,000; that the
latter had retreated to another body
of 30,000, making in the whole
52,000 men, with which hefled with
such precipitation as to abandon ai)
his out ports, with his mi litary chest,
containing 50,000 livres in crown
pieces, besides affignats, and 60 wag

ville feiu the following answer.
" The uiiderfigned, Secretary of
State, in answer to the official note
of yelterday's dale, which lie has
received on the part of the Count
de Stadions & the Prince of Cafteli
cicala, Minilters Plenipotentiary,
and envoys extraordinary of his Im
perial Apostolic Majesty, and of liis
Sicilian Majesty, has the honor of
renewing to those Minilters the ex
preflion of the sincere interest which
the King has always taken in what
ever peiTonally regards their Most
Chriftlan Majesties : an interest
which cannot help being increased
by the unfortunate circuinflances of
the situation in wliich their Majes
ties find themselves at present.
" It is the King's niofl ardent wi/h,
that the fears declared in the note
of the Count de Stadions and the
Prince of Caftelicicala, may not be
realized, but if happily the event
should prove otherwise, his Majesty
will not fail to take the most effec
tual measures to hinder the guilty
persons offo atrocious acrintefrom
finding an asylum in the states of
his Majesty. The King feels a plea
sure in formally giving to Princes
so closely united by the ties of blood
to their most Chriflian Majesties
this aflbrance, which his Majelfy re
gards but as the immediate and ne
cefTary consequence of the principles
and sentiments which have always
directed his condurt:.

For the GAZETTE of the UNITED STATES.
A WRITER in the American Daily Ad
vertiser of the 14th inft. under the signa
ture of Lu c t us, fays, " it appears by the public
prints that there will be a coined for the office of
Vice-President, which becomes vacant 011 the
3d of March next. For the honor of our coun
try, particularly as referring to iti consistency of
character as a r ipoblic, it is to be hoped that
this " conrrfl" will not appear among the inde
pendent eleÂ£lors, whatever importance it may
ajjume in " the public prints."âThe ele&ors of
President, and Vice-President will probably be
mert of information, liberally and independence-,
they will think inA judge\or themselves notwith
flanding all the arts employed to bias their o
pimons, and to place in an unfavorable point of
view the grefent occupant of "the important
ilation" of Vice-P'cfident. The calumniators of
Mr. Adams pretend to be pcrfeflly fatisfied with
the administration of the President of the Uni
ted Statesâand while they discover great soli
citude to depreciate the former ih the public efti
ma'ion, they scarcely rifo a whisper against the
latter ; to fay nothing ot the monarchical features
strongly impicffed on this mode of conduct, a
few simple qu (lions will set its invidious quali
ties in a flrijung point of view.âHas not the
administration o* the supreme executive given
the highest fatisfaftion to the friends of our re
publican cÂ«n(titution ? Is not the Vice-Presi
dent, so far as his " (lation is of importance"
fully implicated in all the applause so justly paid
to the chiel magillrate ? Has ihe eye of
jealousy difcovcred a single trait in the conduct
of thel'e gentlemen, during the period they have
been in office together, which sullies their tame, or
throws the fainteft imputation 011 their public
chara&ers ? Does not the rcafonin* therefore
that applies to the removal of the one, apply
with equal force to the removal of the other ?
But, fay our brethren of Virginia, Mr. Adams is
attached to a hti/anced-government ; he has writ
ten iaiavor of the JJiilifh contliuiLionâ"a go
verrimcnt of king, lords and commons."â] faj >
not go into a defence of the orinciplos contained
in Mr. Adam's writings ; they are bftorc the
publicâand if his euetnie* would fuffer the peo.
pie freely to read and judge for theinfelves, f
am fully of opinio thai the rcfult would be,'' o
remove the mists Of prejudice and error with
wh\ch party has in some parts of the uniou cloud
ed the public mind ; the writer of thit is well
informed that a gentleman. f n public life, 0 f an
acute penetrating under (landing, and wliofe re
publican principles can never be doubled â attcr
reading Mr, Adams's Defence lad winter for the
firll t:me, was asked whether he lound that woife
to contain the anti-rtpH.b\ican principles imputed
to the writer : he replied, " direCtly the revcrfe"
â that in his optnion, c< the Defence ot the
American Canfhtutions," is the best defence of
a hrr republican government in n,c F.:. 1 lan.
guaj/e."âlt is abundantly evident ih.Â»t toe con*
ftttotion of the United Stares i founded on liÂ«
milar principles with those of everv Sate in im?
union â and as it is well known, thai Mr. Adams'*
opinion had great Weight in forming many ot
the Stale LovjlitutionSy aud the conftirution of the
United Stales :s confefledly an improvement up*
on all of them ; it must neceflavily follow, that
it has a decidcd preference in the judgment of
the Vice-Presidentâaccordingly we find it ths
fubjeft of eulogium in the last letter ot the 3d
vol. of his Defence. In short, his known at
tachment to this government hoi been one of the
obje&ions to his political cbara&cr m
the minds of his enemiesâbut it seems to have
been lately discovered that this objection wiii
not suit the prtfont temper of the times; a moil
earneit solicitude being manifefted by the tede
ral intertft through the union, to retain in the
public councils this firm patriot, this unconupt,
and independent politician.
With refpr Â£t to the candidate in oppofitioii,
started orignally in a pretended *' ex>rad of a
letter from Camden South-Carolina," it is obÂ»
fervable what pains the writer of LuCi us takes
to induce a change of whe general sentiment re-
Ipe&ing his political tenetsâbut recent eirrum-.
(ranees firtvc to evince toat Mr Clnwvo'l op.iÂ»*
ions are not changed. The house of reprefentj
tives of the state of New-York, in their address
to the Governor, in answer to his fpeeck the
present feflion, have recognized in pointed iernÂ»s
the bleflings derived to the people, and to that
slate in particular, from the operation of the ge<*
neral government; but the reply to this patriotic
arid federal address, has not one federal feature
in it. " Impressed (fa\s the Governor) with a
high sense of the happiness we enjoy, under ovt
excellent conjlitution, it will give me pleafme to
concur with you in every measure that may tend
to perpetuate the bleflings it is so eminently
calculated to confer." Lucius fays, " it is to
be prelumed that many of his (Mr. Clinton's)
objecfc,oris have been done away by the amend
ments"âthis," it is to be presumed," is a con.
cession made for that gentleman, which not one
thorough-paced antifederalift in the Union would
make. Has one individual of that party evel
made a funilar contelfion ?
The amount of all this business Adams
mull be fct asideâhis honest and independtot
principles have always been in the way to obÂ«
ft raft the machinations of a faction. Alter va
rious coufultations, it has been determined on
to set up Mr. Clinton as a candidate in appor
tion to Mr. Adams, not as a friend to the repub.
fican interest in the United States, but as one
who would concenter the greatest number of an
tifcieral votes. In what quarter these will prin
cipally appear, it is not difficult to determineâ
but, fhouM the plan succeed, is it not evident
that the fpint of the constitution wil' be in
fringed ?âlf the state of Virginia should io
feft fay that Mr. Clinton (hall be Vice-President
of the United Srates, will Hie notdi&ateto ail
the dates in rcgaid to this important officer ?
The provision in the constitution that the
President and Vice-Prcfident finll be ele&ed
from different states, was not intended as an
ideal businessâbut where is the difference be
tween a powerful state's conftitutinr the majo
rity in both, cases, and choofmg both from among
its own citizens ?âWill the people of the Uni
ted States consent that any one state shall give a
President and Vice-President to the Union ?
Mr. Adams, it is insinuated by Lucius, holdi
certain principles unfriendly to republicariifni-*.
all the world may know what that gentleman's
principles areâHe has never been in the habit of
concealing his printipleÂ«. Â«jti|er, er ;a
EuropeâThese principle* are republican, in the
true it sense of the wordâhis country has for ma
ny years, and on innumerable occasions, derived
the mod solid and durable advantages from tho(Â«
principles. Mr. Clinton, it is readily conceded,
has rendered important services to hisconntry ;
that country has remunerated those service
there must be a change, or a serious profpeft of a
change, in regard to his present before
he will relitiquilh the profitable government of
the flare ot New-York, for the honor of being
of the United States, or the writ
er is very much miftakenâlt is not to be pre.
fumed that this idea has escaped the advocate*
for his election in a particular part of the Union
â but there was great difficulty in coalefciug in
favor of any other competitor to Mr. Adams.â
The consequence, a choice by a very small pro
portion o* the electors, in cafe a diviGon could
be excited among the northern electors, wis not
considered of the fmalletl importance, however
fubvei five of republicanismâ-The real republican*
of our country are happily apprized of all thefc
manoeuvresâthe dtfigm ot those who, under
the pretence of foftermg republican principle*,
would destroy every bauier of freedom, by ren
dering the government of the Union contemptible,
are fully cotnptehendedâeven in that state in
which it has been said, that Mr. Adams would
" not have one vote"â" To give a republican
tone therefore to the chara&er, that
may tend to prcferve our liberties lorever,
let the cn lightened electors of the fevera 1 Hates
ftilTdiftinguifii by their fufFragcs, those illustri

whose lives have exhibited one continued feriel
of facrifices and services, for their country*

By thele it appears that the National Aflem
bly closed its career the 21ft SeptemberâOll
that day au address to the National Conven
tion was agreed on by the Afl'emblyâAlter
the address was read, and approved, a deputa
tion from the National Convention havingen
tered the Hull, their (pokefman (aid,
" The National Convention has lent us to
inform you, that they are constituted, and
that they are going tÂ» repair hither, ta com
mence their fittings."
M. Francois, who was in the chair, inform
ed the deputation, that the National Legilla
tive AlTeinbly had just decreed, that they
(hould proceed in a body to the Thuilleries,
to serve as a guard to the Convention.âAll
the members immediately rose up, and thus
terminated, after the existence of a year, the
uoue. which the French
nation marched with giant strides towards
Republicanism
The firft fitting of the National Convention
was on Friday, the 2ift of SeptemberâM.
Petion, F-refident âThe Secretaries, Mefl'rs.
Camus, Qondorcet, Vergniaud, BrifTot, La
fource, a'nd Rabaut-de-St. Elienne.
Two proportions by M. Manuel and Ma.
thieu, caused a long debateâthe firft moved
that the Piefident, whom he called the Preli
dent of fiance, iliouid reside in the National
Palace : that he Ihould always be preceded
by the bridges of the law ; and that when he
entered the Hal], the people Ihould always ho
nor the National Sovereignty, represented in
his per on, by rising up.âThe latter moved,
" that t(ie Convention, invested with the So
vereigny of the People, ihould begin its pro-
by a grand ast of that sovereigntyâ
It mult, (laid he) annihilate in their name all
those authoiities which subsist in the empire,
in order that the power may revfit to the
people."
Theft'jifopolitions were combated by M.
Chabgi f pfto concluded bis remarksJby frying,
" Deciari} that you will invite (he French
people, in the Sections or Aflemblies of the
Commons, to ratify or reject those decrees
which } ou pass."
M. Couthon said, " Let us all swear to
maintain the Sovereignty oj the Peopleâthe whole
oj that Sovereigntyâ and nothing but that Sovereign
ty."
After various propositions, which occaficn
ed some debate, the following, presented by
M. Cheuier, was decreed by the Convention :
" The National Convention declare, that
there can be no Constitution, but that which
is accepted by the people. They declare al
so that persons and property are under the
protection of the law ; that they will after
wards concert the mode which the French
people at large thall pursue to manifeft their
opinion refpefting that Constitution which
(hall be prelented to them."
It was then moved, " that the National
Convention (hould expressly declare, that all
the authorities at present in the exercise of
their functions,thall be provisionally maintain
ed until-further orders."
This occasioned some debate, and at lafl
the principle of the motion was decreed in
the following words :
I. Those Jaws which have not been abro
gated) and those powers which have not been
suspended, (hail be provisionally preserved and
supported.
IJ. The taxes adtually existing (hall be eol

the fitting, when M. Collot d'Herbois, ftart
itig up, cfied out, " There is one declaration
" which ought not to be deferred, even till
the eveningâit is the eternal abolition
'â¢or ROYALTY ll* FRANCE."
The Deputies all rose up, and demanded,
that it might be put to the vote*.
M. B:tzireexclaimed against the enthufiafni
which had taken poffeffon of their minds,and
requeftcd that a question of fiich magnitude
(hould be debated with that calmness and dig
nity becoming the Representatives of a great
People.
Various plans were then offered, a: d the
Convention at length passed the following
Decree â¢
Â« THE NATIONAL CONVENTION
DECREE, THAT ROYALTY IS ABOL
ISHED IN FRANCE."
This Decree was followed by loud and long
continued applauses, and the exclamations of
Vivt U Nation !
The procefs-veVbel of this fitting was or

A correspondent observes, that tbeoppofers
of the re-eleffoon of the Vice-President, have
carefully avoided the affirmative in their dif
cuflion of that gentleman's pretentions to the
fuffrages of his fellow-citizens-âwell knowing
hiÂ»mbitthr? and Jfrtmces an
ble barrier to the force Â©f thole wire-drawn in
sinuations which have an influence on unin
formed and prejudiced rflindsâ-but, continues
our correipondent, the artifices of these theo
retical and intolerant politicians, who torture
opinions, not imbibed in their school, into
ci imes, will most afTuredly fail, so long as rea
son and common sense ihail influence the con
duct of the citizens of the United States.
A correspondent observes, that the experi
ence of the good people of this country is alto
gether opposed to the doArine of tho e who
appear so zealous for coniUtuting a board of
sixty or seventy financiers. It is not perhaps
too much to lay, that the public debt of this
country has been enhanced one quarter part
from the mode of managing the state and con
tinental money concerns by boards and
committeesâ-and the event is devoutly to be
deprecated, when the idea of responsibility, by
being transferred from an individual to a coi
le&ive body, lhall vanifti into airâinto thin
air.
A correspondent, who beard the motion
made by the gentleman from New-Jeifey, for
bringing forward the business of a Bankrupt
Law for the United States, cannot retrain
from exprefTing his fatisfa&ion on the occa
sion. The efforts heretofore made to bring
that ftabje6t to maturity, have certainly fallen
short of the exertions made on many other
point?, to fay the least, not more interesting
to the people.
Boston, November 7,
Extraflof a letter from a gentleman oj the Law, in
London, to his friend in MaJJachufetts, dated
July 10, 1792.
" Pa i n e has been endeavoring to excite the
people of th:s country to destroy our govern
ment, and to substitute his Utopia. I fancy he
knows more of the " Rights" than of the nature
of man; and can have paid but little attention
to the sagacious, temperate, huÂ«maneand pratti
cabie dottrines of that true friend to mankind,
our illustrious Adams. If we really fufhrcd
those grievances here which alone could fanÂ£iioo
a revolt of the peopleâl mean, such as ouf
weighed our prosperity and happiness, a Mas.
saniello or a Wat Tyler, would perhaps
be more likely to carry it than Paine; for our
mob, I find, cannot understand his visions : â
America, I take it, has no mob, nor ever had. In
that country he spoke to a people, under the
very menaces of oppicflion, and who were ge
nerally intelligent enough to undcrilland his Ipi
ritcd sentiments : And as to the several dcfcrip--
tions of people here, who are superior to the
mob (fuclj people, less than any, will not be rea
soned out of their feelings) I take thcfc to feel so
individually, so substantially, and so generally
happy, that it will be at present impofliblc to
persuade them that they are otherwise.
" We fee plain enough how it is in France.
They have fquandeied out so much liberty
among a people, ignorent ot the ule of it, that
there is scarcely energy enough left in the exe
cutive power to extinguish a riot of drunken
Weavers.
" Several attempts have been made here, by
vain Frenchmen (and others who appear to
know full as little of the genius of Joh n Bull.)
to make the "Ca ira" popular; but they might
as well offer him a FtogâHe will never pro
nounce the one, any mote than be will fwsllew
the other."

Or praise their brilliant features,
To celebrate each shape and air,
And swear they're 41 lovely creatures,'' â

Nay, often, the uncultui'd brute
Thus pays his awkward duty

But when through their enchanting
And animated faces, >
The man of sterling ferife descries
Their polifh'd mental graces ;
When he, attentive, hears them speak
In pure, mellifluent measure,
Mild admiration glows his cheek,
His foul dissolves in plea fare !

M cle la Fayette Ims published, in the Lev
den Ghetto, the following address to the army
lately commanded oy him.
" At a time, when after having concurred
in two great revolutions, I enjoyed in retire
ment tne success of my constant efforts' for the
canfe of the people, the dangers of the country
"latched me from a private life ; I came in the
micft ot the applauses of the nation, to com

Conftnution and La Fayette.' Since this ~
you have had the means of judging ,â e
Your confidence (hewed me that you approved
my conduct ; your fnendlhip answered to the
tender attachment-wjiich I had vowed to vâ u
Happy to defend, m the midst of fotdiers de-tr

thiâ relittance ot a tree people to f 0 manv
eifor s re-umted agaiult then,, every thing that
opinions and animate my
tl You will remember, I fear, with uneafmefs
that a turbulent faction, whose movements &p-
peered to me to correspond with those of our
exterior enemies, endeavored to deprive us of
that which makes the force of a free people, res-
pest for the laws and fidelity to the constitution,
which in this moment seemed to me to be our
only point for rallying. My conduit was known
to, and my opinion.-, were snared by youâmy
franknefs animated more and more against me
all the enemies of the constitution ; but what
ever were their efforts and their menaces, the
national afTembly, by a majority of two-thirds,
repulsed their absurd accusations heaped up a
gainst me. Ycu know the violences offered the
next day to the national alltmbly j those exer
cised on the loth of August agaiuft the king;
the state of Paris at the moment i'-'ien the ftil
pension of the king was decreed ; thp murders,
the proscriptions which took place, not only
during the battle at the Thuilleries, but even
during the following days. I refer in this ref
pe<st to the decrees of the department of Ar
dennes and of the municipality of Sedan, and
to the few accounts which were fuffered to pass,
while all the papers, devoted to the Jacobin
party, were circulated with profufion. It was
evident, that the measures taken on th** loth
of August were contrary to the constitution atf,
and that they were forced from the national as
sembly. This con vision guided my conduct.
The administrative bodies and the municipa
lities required you to renew the ci/icoath; the
constitution has determined this and or
dered you to obey the requisitions of the con-,
ftituted authorities. It was with regret that I
saw a part of the army so far from the fulfill
ment ot this duty, that I would have spared
them the evil of refuting it. The pains taken
to calumniate me in your opinion, have suc
ceeded so far as to alienate a part of your con
fidence. On the ot-her fide the commifjioneri
ot the national afTembly, who"; accept don
the loth of August, the ex- cutic. the de
crees which violence to 1 c > fchetf them,
deprived me of part o my r C - i-d from
Dunkirk to Maubeuge ; im\ r proposed
equally to destitute me o* u.ai which united
me to you, and to renew against me those ac
cu fat ions which neither the aflembly, the juries
or the judges, were any longer free to decide
upon, in the state to which violence had re
duced them.
" Iu these circumstances, and when the pre
sent faction directs itfelf principally against the
authors of the revolution, against the true
friends of the constitution, I ceased (%' be des
tined to fight at your head, and I could no
longer hope for an ufeful death. What re
mained for me to do > To remove from you a
general, whom you would be forbidden to obey,
and to preserve to liberty a defender, whose in
flexibility has merited for him, in this moment,
the honor of being proscribed. I separate mv
felf, therefore, from you; I fepa> Lte mvfclf
with a sentiment of grief, which it is, at Jeaft,
sweet to pojjr into the bosoms of those of my
companions in arms, who have preserved for
me their affection. I took, before letting out,
all the measures which could anfwet tÂ« me for
your fafety ; and I go far from my country,
where a party reigns which proscribes me, far
from the enemies coalesced against us, and
whom I hoped to combat at your head, to taste,
in my retreat the consolation of a pure con
science and to form ardent willies for the tri
umph of French liberty over all the fa&ions
who seek to enslave it.

" 1 Kings in the capital remain much as they
were last pod ; the flow approach of the com
bined armies gives rife to many conjectures'-
their friends attribute the slowness of their ad
vance to prudent well-digested caution, whilst
their enemies attribute it to fear of being fur
lounded, defeated and cut to pieccs; but we
have lome reason to believe that it will turn out
that the wisest councils direst tbeir operations
and that it will appear that measures of confe'
qnence are concerting that will occasion an im
portant change in the affairs of France; in fact
the sensible part of the nation, those who nei!
therwifh to fee despotism re-eflahlifhed, nor
the reign of anarchy prevail, but who anxiouflv
desire to fee a liberal government established,
nch as will do honor to human nature, are (fe
conded by a strong party) bulily employed in
negotiation with ti.e Court of Great-Britain
