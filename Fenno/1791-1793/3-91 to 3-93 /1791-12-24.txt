THE PRESIDENT'S ANSWER.
â " Sentiments worthy of Hen-
Sire,
The National A (Terribly come to a conclufioil
of their labours, now reap the firll fruits ol them.
Convinced that the government which belt iuits
France is that which conciliates the relpectabie
prerogatives of the throne to the inalienable
rights of the people, they have given to the em
pire a constitution which equally fecuresroyalty
and national liberty. The fate of France is con
nected with the speedy and proper execution of
this constitution, and all the means to promote
that execution feeni united at preienr.
Soon Sire the civic wilh tl)at your majelij
just exprefled will be gratified j-foon returning
,o our homes, we (ball shew an example oi obe
dience to the laws, after having made them, and
teach that there can be no liberty, without re
fneift for conftiiuted authority.
Our fuccefl'ors, veiled with the powers on the
exereife of which the profpenty of the empire
depends, will neither mistake the object of their
important million, nor the confhtuuona) bounds
of it, nor the means of well difcharg.ng their
â¢ rust. They are worthy, Sire,â they will always
(hew them (elves worthy of the confidence which
places in their hands the fate of the nation :
And ycu, Sire, have already altnofl fixed that
13 Your majefly has put an end to the revolution,
by your fair and open acceptation of the condi
tion. You have disheartened our external e
nemies, yon have strengthened internal confi
dence, restored the nerve of government to its
vigor, and secured the ufeful exertions of an ac
tive administration. _ ,
Yoor heart, Sire, has already formfeed 3on a
recompense. Your majesty has enjoyed the ~,
terefting fpedtacle of public joy. tour fcnfibili
ty has been gratified by the marks of gratitude
and love exhibited by the people.
The sensations neceflary to form the happ.nef.
of good kings are due you ; Sire, they will ever
exist in you, and their energy will .ncreafemore
and more as .he nation (hall benefit by con

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY, December 13, 1791.
Dcb.lt! on the amendments prcpofeil by the Senate to
the Repref.ntation Bill.
SOME debate havng taken place, refpefting
the regularity of a resolution moved by Mr.
Benfon, for apportioning among the different
slates (according to their refpeJtive numbers)
the whole number of Representatives, produced
by (lie gross amount of the aggregate populati
on of the United Scans ;â
Mr. Sedgwick moved, to amend the Senate's
amendment, by infering two members for the
(late of Delaware, instead of on:.
In favor of this motion it was observed, that
the injury, arising from unrepresented fratfiions
of population, is morefeverely felt by the small
er, than by the larger flares, as in the cafe oft be
ftateof Delaware, to vhich the bill allowed but
one reprefencative f0r59,000 inhabitants, whilll
the larger states wouU! be much better represent
ed, as their fractions vould be divided among a
greater number of representativesâBy the a
mendment proposed to the Constitution, a lati
tude, it was said, was given to Congress in this
particular, allowing tieni either to apply the ra
tio to the aggregate amount of the general popu
lation, and then to apportion the representation
to the different states, as nearly as they could ap
proach Hie ratio once eilablifhedâor to apply
the ratio to the population of each Hate ; and if
in cafe of applying the ratio to the aggregate
number of the inhabitants of the United Slates,
the number of reprefetjtatives was found to be
exaiftly one hundred, it appeared doubtful whe
ther Congress could wtll avoid adopting the for
mer mode : otherwifeit would be impossible to
apportion the representation to the population
with exac r t pi ecifion ; Hen it the United States
were to be divided into diftridts of thirty thou
sand inhabitants each, there would still remain
a fraction, and inequality f<yne where or other
mud be ilie consequence : '
In the bill, it was said, a manifeft inequality
appeared, as it nllowedVirginiato eleifi twenty,
one representatives, whereas, according to the
proportion which her population bears to that
of the United States in general, fl lc j s entitled
only to nineteen : the constitution has said, that
" representatives and diretl taxes shall be ap
portioned among the several states, according te
their respeCtive numbers but iftaxation were
to be apportioned in the fame manner as the re
presentation is by the bill, the inequality would
be finking, and such as never would be submit
ted to lUiode-Ifland, for iuftauce, being re
presented by two members, would have to pay
60,000 dollars, whilst Delaware, having but a
single reprelentative, would pay only 30,000 al
though the difference of population is so small
between those two ftateiâR,hode Island having
only about 68,000 inhabitants, whilst 50,000 are
found in the slate of Delaware âthe time may
come, when the fafety and good order of govern
metu will require the imposition of direct taxes â¢
ij.it how can any such taxes be laid, without a
Eew census, and a just apportionment of the re
prcfentation ? before these steps could betaken
the measure might be too late ; and it would be
1111 wtie in the present Congress to pass any law
that may at a future day, deprive the House of
Oivc-O.i jts conliitutional powers, the power of
laying direct taxesâlt was further observed that
the Confbt.mon itfelf did not seem to exaift so
rigul an observance of die ratio, as to require
that any state should be deprived of a reprefem
ative merely on account of a trifling deficiency
Â«n the number of inhabitants ; it appeared vifi- I
VfÂ° contemplate such deficiency, and that there
might be states whose entire population would
not amount to the ratio that might betfxed on :
ihll it had provided that such states should not
reman, uâ represented ; but that, however small
the population may be, << each state shall have at
least one reprefentat.v e :"_the convention them
ehes who framed the Constitution, were not
such fcrnpulous observers of trifling fractional
differences, when they apportioned the repre
fenta.ion ; for altho, by the estimate of popula

The constitution direrts, that taxation fl, in

a tune when no local lnterells could be supposed
to influence the decision ; and it was then de

It was expetfted that the dispersed 'ituation of

Late accounts from Rotterdam mention, that
Gin has risen in pi ice from 71. ss. roi4l. per calk,

most popular, the molt friendly to republican liberty and then

tate Tho the constitution of the nation is acopvofthe bell of
,Â»i' a 'n C ? n ; t , Ut r ons ' P' rrha P san improvement upon them all,
yet this style of suspicion and accusation may grow into a hat,,,
very much to the prejudice of thofc sentiments of brotherhood
Which ought to prevail in every American bosom. The roncl .
lion from these obfervat.ons, is, that the government of the Uni
ted States having been Called into being and supported thus far
by the enlightened zeal and virtue of our bed and wisest citizens,
the neceflity still subsists for those men to aid it, to watch for it
and to guard it against those encroachments which maybeattempt
ed upon its authority. Jealousy against government is often re
commended ; let it still be wakeful : But jealousy for govern
ment is alio a virtueâas our present condition proves. We (hould
to this day have remained a divided people, if the friend, of
union had not guarded with a wife jeoloufy against the further
prottranon of all government; it was in effect liberty that they
watched for.âAnd (uch men will never be falfe to it. It is hoped
that they will never cease to pay attention to the conduftof go
vernment, as the weight of their virtuous influence will he fuffi
cient to iupport a good one, and to reform a bad one. There is
appearance that they are become more inattentive and cold
towards It than they once were. Being in part a government over
governments, questions of jurifdiftion will anfe. Very good
men it is well known incline to extend the jurifdiaion which
they exercise ; difputesÃetween the State and national govern
ments will anfeâcandor will allow that it is probable the latter
will be in the right half the times : But there are reasons
which will operale to make error and encroachment aopear
less excusable on the part of Congress than of a State legiflj
ture. In every fray, we naturally enough take part against the
strongest. A State, a small one especially, is not the object of fear
to the unionâand under this ltnprcflion it is overlooked that an
encroachment made by one State eftablilhes a new and more am
ple line of authority to every other. In this way the power of
Congrrfs may be pared away, and the lrisnds ot union may not'
take any alarm.
On the other hand, the authority of the union being exercised
in one place, being very conspicuously placed, excites the feais of
manv, even when it keeps within its proper boundsâbut if it
(hould pais them, the whole people would fee and check them.
Thus, Congress will feel the llrongefl rellraints against any undue
exercise of its power.
Very sanguine hopes were entertained at the time of the
blifhment ol the Bank of the United States, of its eminent utilit/ vt
to trade. We have seen its firft operations. Though the transac
tions of a Bank are not expoted to view, yet enough is conje&ur
fd, and on very fatisfaftory grounds, relating to the great e\tent
of its deposits and discounts, to juftify the conclusion that our firft
hopes will not be disappointedâCertainly the affairs of a trad
ing country cannot be well managed, where a Bank of extenlive
circulation is not in being. The utility of a Bank is little (hort
of that of a Canalâit opens a trade where obstacles not less flub,
born than those of nature's make, would have prevented any with
out it.
The late Fires which have diftreflcd a part of the public, were
solely kindled by the hand of a malevolent boy, who, after an
examination before the Mayor, uniformly perseveres in his de
claration, that he alone was the actual incendiary, and that no
other person was in any degree concerned in his villainy. The
panic therefore excited on that occasion, mult subside ; and age,
sickness and debility may taketheir usual repose. It nigft how
ever be confefTed, that the conduct of this boy has been artful
and attrocious, and can scarcely be paralleled. *"

REVENUE LA W.
By JOHN NEVILLE, Inspector of the Revenue,
Survey No. 4, District Pennsylvania
CONGRESS began with dutus on goods imported from a
broad. Thefirlk fcflion they paired a law layingfuch dune's,
to an ixtcnt that was then supposed to be as high'as was proper.
In a second fcflion, they added to those duties conlidcrabty, and
in the very adt of which you complain, they made a furthei and
a material addition to the duty oodiftilLcd Ipiriu brought fiom
abroad.
But as it appeared that the proceeds of all these duties would
fall ihorr, fcveral hundred thousand dollars, of the sum necessary
for the payment of nnereft on the public debt and the support "i
government, it became rieceflary to provide some additional
fund.
The committee in the four western counties of this State, in
timate the policy of an increafcof the duties on imported articles.
But the two houses of Congress, s'nd the great body of the mer
chant in ail the States, are of a different opinion. Who have the
best means of judging ? Who are most likely to be in the right ?
What rrafons are given to shew the policy ol such an increase ?
Long and multiplied experience has proved, that, if duties on
importation are carried beyond their proper limit, they do not
produce revenue, but Smuggling, fraud and perjury in abundance.
Would it be wife in government to force the growth ol such de/-
truÂ£live weeds, or to hazard the ruin of trade by opprcflive du
ties J Is it the interest of any part of the community that trade
fliou'd be ruined ; How will the merchant be able to purcbafe
and rxport the produce ot the farmer, if he is prevented from
arrying on his business with reasonable advantage.
Should duties on the importation of goods be carried to an im
propcr cvi' nr, trie farmer would not the pcr!<;n ]. v ; iuim'-n
ay it. Among the evil co/ifrqucnew to him. a failure of revenue,
from the prevalency of i 1 ug, would oblige the govermcnt
to lay upon houses ard lands wh it, by attempting too much in
one way, it had failed to get from the other source.
Is it even certain, if the thing were in itfelf praÂ£ticable and
proper, that it would be the intcreft of those who live at a dis
tance from the fca, to prefer an increase of the duty on imported
articles, to a duty on spirits diftillecl among themselves : would
they not be obliged to pay more in the enhanced price of the fo
reign manufaÂ£)ures, which they necefTarily consume, by the ad
vance whicn 1 lie several claflVs or dealers fucceflively charge on
the duty, than they/would have to pay 011 the spirits diftiilcd by
and among themselves ?
If Congrcfs had not had good ground to think, that the duties
on imported articles were fufnciently high in the main, they
would naturally have been led to increase them, ratherthan h <ve
ecourfe to an internal dut v, which J icy could not but â¢ â¢ ...
Would meet with more objcdilion. Wi cn :!iis is duly c-n
ed, when it is also considered, t.;at the pcrfons who have liar'
opportunities of information on the fubjeft, view it in
-J light, cud, ) ovc all, v hen the 11igh r->tcs f ihr* cxiUw ;
Â»s are carefully examined, I perfuadc tnyfclf that you -/.â â¢â¢] ; c
>â¢ opinion, that the additional revenue, which was ncceflary,
-OUiu not wifely have been attempted to be raised by an increase
;>i the duties on imported articles.
But the committee suggest another rcfource for supplying the
deficiency. This is a reduction of the fabrics and c.mnpenfations
of trie officers and members of the government. It is not my
province, to enter into a difcuflion, how far those falarirs are or
are not extravagant. I fliall only observe, that no redu&ion of
them, which the moil economical could desire, would afford a
laving that would bear any proportion to the turn required. The
whole amount of the falarics and competitions of the Prcfiden't,
Vic.-Prefident, the two houses of Congress, the judicial and Ex
ecutive Departments, Officers of the government of the Western
temtory, Board of Commiflioncrs for setting of accounts, foreign
Minifltrs, and all other officers borne on the civil lift, exceeds
but little, 300,000 dollais. The whole of 1 his would be a very
inadequate lubftitute for a deficiency of 600,000 dollars. The
amount of any reduction which could be made, would be infig
nihcant in the comparison. It is, therefore, a plain cafe, that
t is expedient would not tupcrcede the ne;elTity of a further tax
ot lome Kind or other.
A tax on the certificates themselves is proposed. This would
vCtr.e lame as if, between individuals, a debtor being stronger
t.an the creditor, and there being no superior judge to controul
Him, ihould force him to accept fifteen (hillings for twenty
w ich he owed : judge of the honesty of this expedient. The
committee have not noticed, what is a fact, that the public crc
'n S cner al have already voluntarily agreed to accept four in
-0 fix per cent* for ten years on the,whole amount of their
principa., for the accommodation of the government. Would
u c ju. k 10 mulct them in,the bargain ?As consumers and pro
priety s ihey pay their full share of the general taxes. Remem- I
oer.ihat a Urge propo.tion of the public creditors are ftiil thof.
,i'dJn C ce and rUppl '" comribulcd to give you liberty and
Ime ml. r, that 011 full examination a discrimination was

Inrcly cannot complain of this, for we had but latelv funded our

Holy Bible.â-Royal Quarto.
MR. THOMAS, of Worccfter, Malfachufetts, rood refpeft
fuHy informs the public, ihat he has this day completed the
Old and New Testaments of his Royal Quario .Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE. The Apocrypha and Index, See. will be finifh
ed with all the dispatch the nature of the work will admit.
Such Gentlemen as hold Subscription Pafers, he beps will
return them to him at IVorceJler, or to him and Company at Bojlon,
by the last day of November next, and as much sooner as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work has been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has ruet
with their highest approbation; both as to the execution of the
printing, its correftnefs, and its cheapness compared with Englifk
copies of the fame size and quality.
As this very laborious and exceedingly expenfrve undertaking,
is carried on solely at his own cost, he is led to hope that all those
who wilh to po fiefs a Family Bible, will so far encourage this
laudable undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
to the fubfeription.
