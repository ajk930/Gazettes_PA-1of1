that of objecting to bills which have palled the

not cling to the honor or emolument of an rrii,ce

The Houfc refwned the debates.
On M. Breard's motion, the Afiem
bly decreed, that the new municipa
lity fliould inform the legislative bo
dy, of the fiate of the capital, every
hour. The municipal officers were
authorized to adopt what nveafures
they might think most expedient for
vectoring peace and good order.
A national guard came to the bar :
he declared, it was urged to fend
troops to the Thuilleries, in order to
put a ftopto the depredations com
mitted in every apartment of the Pa
lace. He added, that several persons
had been taken in the ail of pi I lag
ing, and the people had punilhed
them with death !
Another petitioner (hewed the ne
ceffiry of carrying away the dead bo
dies fcauered over the Palace-garden.
A moment after, a commiflary in
formed the Houl'e that there were
several carts at the Palace-gate ro car
ry away the dead. .
The redtor of Natuerre, a munici
pal officer of that dillricl,announced,
that several Swiss had been taken in
to custody, they were disguised.â
They said, they were day laborers,
but their foreign dialedt betrayed
them. A crowd soon gathered round
the guard room ; their heads were
called for : the municipal officers, he
added, were exerting their belt en
deavors to Sppeafe the people's rage ;
bui that their efforts were directed in
vain.
Several citizens came to the bar
and laid down a great number of va
luable articles saved from the wreck

The co mmi (Tat ies of the commons
of Paris were invited to the har ; _
they gave the following account ol
the IVate ofthccapital : The ferment

â 1 he members of t lie commons have
superseded all the justices of the
peace in the different fet'tiotis : the
general aflembl; of the fertions are
now itmtted with that authority.
No body can go out of Parisâ The
commander in chief of the national
guards and the commiflkries have
taken the proper steps to iinprifon
the Swiss, who are now confined in
the different guard rooms.
A national guard came to the bar,
followed by a great number of citi
zens : he declared, that theSwirs sol
diers who were in the guard room of
the Frtiillants were not guiltv ; he
said, that they had not, nor would
not fire on the people, and that they
had dilcharged their niufkets in the
an-, as a proof of tbeir good and
.mentions : ,he petitioner
added.that 3000 persons had been
witnelles to what he advanced
The people in the galleries did not
â¢think the owifs innocent ; they cx
claimedCda eft faux !"
The petitioner answered, that seve
ral members of the afTembly, could
and would vouch for the veracity of
Jus ailertions. J
1 he aflembJy commended the ee
nerof.ty of the volunteer, who resum
ed the fnbject. He laid, he would
go and endeavor to calm the people,
b) proving the innocence of Ihe few

(Those were the expressions, which
were much applauded.)
The Swiss ptomifed they wotili at
all times behave like worthy chizerrs.
M. Chabot knew that all the Svifc
were not gnilty. He moved that
theyfhonldbecommitted to theAbbiye

those Swiss had impeached the con
duel of iheir flafF officer*.
The legislative body decreed,,that
they should Jbe committed to prison,
and that some members oFtfoe aflein

The Swiss were leaving the 1

i'embly notice ofhis promotion ; and
| communicated the measures he had
adopted for insuring the public tran
quility. He said, he had summoned
the citizens to their refpeelive guard
rooms ; that he had established seve
ral patroles through the town. jvi.
Santerre's generous condutfl received
merited applause.
A great noise was heard about the
Aflemblv-Hall.
M. Duhem thought it won id belie
ceflaiy to detain the Swiss a little
longer.
The motion was seconded by M.
Mailli. He was of opinion that the

he promised to canfe the laws of e
quality and liberty to be executed to
the bell of his abilities ; and to ex

than be a perjured villain.
M. Rolaud, Secretary for the Home
Department, took the fame oath.
M. Page, the Naval-Secretary echoed
the fame lemiments of patriotism.
M. D.mton, keeper of the seals,

LONDON, Augult 28.
All the custom-house cutters at
Portftnouth were yesterday put under
the command of Admiral Lord Hood,
and several other dispositions made,
Which are never adopted but for the
purposes of a general ihiprefs of sea-
men.
Whether these steps indicate an in
tention in our court to takean a<Sive
part in the continental difpates, or
whether they are merely.precaution
ary measures to enable us to atft as
circumftar.ce* and found policy may
afterwards didtate, a iirtle time will
probably determine.
It is confefled in Paris that the ad
vanced guard of the main army at
Fontoy has sustained an attack by the
Auftrians, in which 400 men fell on
the fide of the French, though the
enemy was repulsed.
The Duke of Brunfwick was at Lux
embourg for a few hours 011 the 14th
of this month. On the 1 sth came the
King of I'rulGa on horse back, whom
the goveroor received at the entrance
of the town, and accompanied with
great form to all the reuiarkabic parts
of the fortrefs. After taking foine
1 efrefhment, he returned on the (ante
day to the camp at Montfort.

these objedhons which are polnical, may be added

After the compleat refutation of
the charge which has so frequently
been brought against a certain pub
lic officei, of his being an advocate
for the doctrine that " public debts
are public blessings," the reiteration
of the aflertion on the part of our
anarchy-men, difcoveisa difpoHtion
exactly on a level with the old wo
man's, who being charged not to fay
lanotherI another crooked word, ciied outâ
" Rams horns, if 1 die for it."
A writer in a Bolton paper, speak
ing of the National Bank, fays, the
" Uiiectors are principally members
of Congress." This is one, among
many of the unqualified untruths
which support the opposition to the
measures of the general government.
The fatSt is, that not one third of the
Directors are members of Congreft.
The experience of France is a les
son to all mankind ; and if they will
not improve it to their own advan
tage, it will bebecaufe kingdoms and
states are so blind and corrupt, that
they are unprepared for, and unwor
thy of the bleflings of free and just
government. The arbitrary govern
ments of Europeought totake solemn
warning in due season, and by relin
jquifhing their afl'umed powers, by
Kvbich they uniuftly dispose of the
Ijves, liberties and pro;*rties of tlie
peÂ°pit ameliorate the condition of
-heir fulqects- and by -dimiuifhing
<heir fenle of injury, and encreafing
their means of enjoynient, attach
10 Mthoriijr from convic
tion and sentiment, rather than by
the force of power and the terror of
arm*. Those governments called
tree, should eradicate exitting abuse*
which have no plea for their conti
nuance, but precedent and the rult
of antiquityâthey should accommo
date their laws wore and more to
promoting the etfemial inteielis of
the great body of the peopleâto ele
vating the poor on the pillars of
knowledge and equal rightsâlo dif
fufing general light and information
among the peopleâfor no govern
ment, however just, and much lels
an oppreflive one, can be permanent,
that is not founded on the enlight
ened attachment of the people. In
ihis way alone, can ihofe iultiiutious
be preserved which are founded on
the immutable principles of huinart
natureâftnee ignorance, in its pÂ».
roxy fins of frenzy, will level in indis
criminate ruin, the establishments of
I wisdom and patriotism, as well as the
impofuions of despotism. An en
lightened people can alone appreci
ate the importance of a government
of lawsâignorance is the loij which
produces demagogues, parties and
uncontrolled ariflocracies, and which
in the end invariably produce des
potism.
The experience of France and oF
other countries, ihould infpiie the
people of the United [states with the
highcfl veneration for their own free
eletftive governmentâand make them
more and more solicitous to preserve
in violate the sacred right offuffrage
and here again the immense impor
tance of information and general
knowledge among the people, is strik
ingly apparentâfor wiihout these,
this inestimable right will be proflri
tuted to party purposes, and to the
fubvertion of the constitution and the

gives the following accsiihr, in the

that none is more simple, nor none
vyhereby the fame qtiahtity is mors

Such is mv confidence wirli refpetfi to
