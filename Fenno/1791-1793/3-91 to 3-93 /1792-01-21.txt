LONDON, November I.
The following paper has been circulated at Paris,and
Ilands pre rifely on the fame authority as the ether
publications Â»/ the fame nature.
The Prorefl of tile Princes of the Koufe of Bour-
bon, agaiuft the acceptance of the CoiiUitucion.
" I T is in vain that an unfortunate monarch,
A always captive, though free in appearance,
has consented to the ruin of his faithful fubjeifts
âto the ruin of the Monarchyâby accepting a
prerended Constitution of the Empire ; it is in
vain that he h>s signed his own degradation ;
this fanciion which the King has given in fait
to a monstrous code, is really no (auction in right.
And who can be persuaded of the legality of
fiich an aflent, while every thing proclaims the
contrary ?
" Can a Prince, left alone amidst usurpers,
farrounded with the wrecks of his own throne,
encempafled by fears and menaces, beset by in
trigue, have freedom of choice ? And without
freedom of choice, is not every consent null ?
" Freedom consists in beingable to chufe with
out danger, and without fear ; it cannot exilt
without this condition, and consent is null,when
refulal .would hazard the ftifety and property of
him who gives it. If the King had refilled to
accept the conflitution, he would have been de
prived of the crown ; so had the ufnrping Ai
fembly decreed. And in rejecting with difdaili
a degraded crown,when presented by a seditious
Aflembly, was the King master of the choice of
his asylum ? and would he not have exposed his
person, and all that was Hill more dear to him,
ta ouirage, and his faithful fubjecfls to proscrip
tion, to murder, and to conflagration j
" Without doubt, had Louis XVI. entertain
ed the hope of dying at least with glory, if his
blood could have saved France, the inheritor of
the virtues of Henry IV. would have displayed
his courage. Forced to obtain his inheritance
by conquest, he would, like him, have been the
victor and the father of his fubjeifts ; and, like
him, would have compelled them to become hap
py. But what can courage do without support !
Henry had an army ; while Louis, alone,betray
ed, abandoned, captive in the hands of his ene
mies, without troops, without auxiliaries, forced
even to regret the happy obfeuriry of the tnean
eft of his fubjeifts, in the midlt of an importunate
crowd, who served rather to besiege than defend
him, found not even one friend to share his sor
rows, and wipe away his tears..
" The King Then could form no other deter
mination than that which he adopted, without
hazarding the loss of his crown, and perhaps of
his life. His degradation, and even his death,
would have been an useless facrifice to honor ;
it would have caused France long and fruitlefs
remorse, but could not have saved it.
" The King then was not free ; bis famlion
is therefore null : and in this cafe to disobey il
lusory orders, is t-o give the llrongeft and mod
cpnrageous proof of obedience and fidelity ; it
is to serve the real Monarch, it is to lerve God
and our country
" Scarcely could this pretended afTent be ere
lited, if the King had proclaimed it ainidlV his
amilv, furroiinded with his ancient and faithful
ervants, with all his military houfhold, in fine,
vith all the splendor of his former power. Then
:he royal aflenr, though the occasion of so much
rwirt, would nevertheless have been recognized
as just, at lealt reputed free ; then we might
h;ive condemned the error of the Prince, but
should not have wept over his ch;iins ; then the
fact would have been inconteftible, we could on
ly have disputed the right.
" In even if the King had enjoyed full
pofleffion of his liberty, would he have had the
right to famftion laws contrary to the fundamen
tal laws of the kingdom ? Could he, from a niif
raken generoiity, and in the expectation of a de
ceitful calm, have facrificed, alon-g v.ith himfelf,
his family, his fucceflors, the true happiness of
the people, generations present and to come ?
Could he give a valid approbation ro the pre
tended Conftitmion, which had occasioned so
many misfortunes? Poflefior for life of the throne
which he received from his ancestors, could the
King, in .alienating his primordial rights, destroy
the constitutive bafig on which it is founded?
Born Defender of the Peligion of the State,
â could he consent to what tends to its ruin, and
abandon its ministers to wretchedness and dif

grace ? Bound to adininifter juflice to his fub
could he renounce the function, efleutially
royal, of caufiug it to be administered by tribu
nals legally conltituted, and of superintending
himfelf the administration ? Protector of the
rights of all the orders, and of the pofl'eflions of
individuals ; could he sanction the invasion of
the one, and the violation of the other ? Father
of the People, could he abandon them to disorder
and anarchy ! In fine, could he highly approve
what reason and jultice condemn, and eternize
the misfortunes of France ?
" And what is this Conrticntion, which they
pretend to give us, except a nionfter deftrurtive
of laws human and divine ; a work of offence
and iniquity ; null, from the vice of the convo
cation of the members of the/Ufembly, (tiling
theinfelves Constitutive ; null from ihe combi
nation of the Deliberating Body, a combination
f'ubverfive of the firlt basis of the State, the dif
tintftion of orders ; null from the principles
which it eltabli(hes,lince they overturn the throne
and the altar, and tend to replunge men into
barbarism by appearing to bring them back to
nature; null from its consequences, dreadful
confeqwences, of which experience already pre
sents a too fsmhtol catalogue in the disorder of
the finances, in the scarcity of money, in the
stagnation of commerce, in the want of disci
pline among the troops, in the inactivity of the
tribunals, the silence of the laws, thetyrannyof
the factious, and the oppreflion of the rich ; in
one word, the triumph of licentiousness over true
liberty ?
" It would be nfelefs to accumulate Veafoning ;
truth is roo striking ; and faifis already speak so
loudly, that the cortfeqtience cannot be denied,
without a species of felf-deception. The King
then had no right to fan<fiion such a Constitu
tion, ot which his faneflion, already null by the
defeat of freedom, is null likewise by the defect
of right.
" Ah ! when victorious overthe Gauls the firft
Franks adeuibled in the Champ-de-Mars, raised
Pharnmond on the ftie!d ; when their warlike
voices exclaimedâ" Reign over us, and let your
descendants reign over our children," they
were far from forefeeing, that at the end of
fourteen ages a generation would come, whose
madnef's would deltroy the work of wisdom and
of valour! When Philip the Fair, reviving the
rights of the people, that had been disregarded
under indolent Monarchs, fuminoned to the
States General the Deputies of the Third Eflate,
and placed them along with the Peers of his
realm, he did not fufpetft that one day this un
grateful order would overturn the two ethers,
would deck ambitious Tribunes with the spoils
of Supreme Power, and leave only the phantom
of a King on the throne of Charlemagne.
" No, it fliall not be so : no, the French Mo
narchy shall not perish. And since motives
it is impossible for us to perceive, but which can
originate only from the violence and constraint
which, by being disguised, are only more cruel,
force Louis XVI. to subscribe an acceptance
which his heart rejedts, which his own interelt
and that of his people condemn, and which his
duty as King expressly prohibits ;
"We protest in the face of the whole world,
and in the most solemn manner, against this illu
sive atfi, and all that may follow from it. We
have (hewn that it is null of itfelf, null by defed't
of liberty, null from the radical vice of all the
operations of the usurping Assembly, which not
being an Assembly of the States General, is no
thing. We are supported by the rights of the
whole nation, in rejecting decrees diametrically
opposite to their wiJhes, expressed by the unani
mous tenor of inflrucftions to their Representa
tives ; and we disavow, on behalf of the nation,
those treacherous mandatories, who,in violating
their orders, and departing from the milfoil en
trulled to them, ceased to be its Representatives.
We will maintain what is evident, that having
acfted contrary to their title, they have atfed
without power, and what they could hot legally
do 'cannot be. validly accepted.
" We protest for rhe King, and in his name,
againll only what can bear its falfe iinpreflion.
His voice beiug ftifled by oppression, we will be
its neceilary organs ; and we express his real
fentimenis as they exilt in the oath of hiÂ» ac
ceillon to the throne, as they have appeared in
the adiions of his whole life, as rtrey have been
difpl3jed in the Declaration which he made at

[Whole No. 28/5.]
the fir ft moment that he believed himfelf free.
He neither can nor ought to have any other, and
hit will exillsonly in thofeac'ts where it breathes
free!v.
We protest for the People, who, in their
delirium, cannot perceive haw deitruiftive this
phantom of a new Conftitution,which is made to
dazzle their eyes, and before which they are
vainly made to fvvear, mult become to them.
When thef'e people neither knowing their law
ful Chief, nor their dearelt interelts, fuller them
ielves 10 be misguided to their definition ; when
blinded by deceitful proiniies, they fee nocthofe
who excite them to deltroy the pledges of their
own security, the fnpporters of their repose, the
principles of their fubfillence, and all the ties of
their civil aflociatiou ; it becomes neceflary to
claim for them the i e-eftabliflunent of all'thefe ;
it becomes neceflary to lave them from their
own frenzy.
We protest for rhe religion of our fathers,
which is attacked in its dogmas and worftiip, as
well as its Ministers ; and in order to fnpply the
Monarch's want of power at present to dii'charge
in his own person his ddties as-eldest Ton of the
Church, we a Hume in his name thedefence of its
rights ; vveoppoi'e those invasions of its proper
ty which tend to degrade it ; we rife with in
dignation againlt arts which menace the king
dom with the horrors of fchifin ; and we loudly
profefs our unalterable attachment to the Eccle
siastical Rules admitted in the States, the obser
vance of which he has fwornto maintain.
" We piotefV for the fundamental maxims of
the Monarchy, from which the King is not per
mitted to depart ; which the nation itfelf has de
clared to be inviolable ; and which would be to
tally reversed by the decrees which abolish Roy
alty itfelf; by suppressing ail the intermediate
ranks ; by those which deprive Monarchy of the
functions molt eilential to Monarchical govern
ment.
" In fine, we prorefl: in the pretence of the
Supreme Being, and in the name of Eternal Jus
tice, for all Orders of the State, and for all
Frenchmen.
" This Protest, signed along with us by all the
Princes of the Blood who are connected with us,
is common to all the HoufeofÃourbon, on whom
their eventual rights to the crown impose the
duty of defending the anguft deposit. >

Coblintz, Oflober 8, I 791.
A meflenger arrived in town on Wednesday
with dispatches from Conflantinople, Warsaw,
Vienna and Berlin, containing the treaty of peace
with the Turks, signed by all the powers con
cerned.
Letters from Stockholm mention, that in con
sequence of the report becoming public th?re,
that the King intended to aflitl the French refu
gee princes, in re-establishing them and their ar
bitrary power in France, several of the Swedi(k
regiments have declared they will not act, and
it is thought such will become the general decla
ration of the army.
The Kingof Sweden's acquiescence to his Most
Chriltian Majesty's acceptance of the Crown,wiih
the limitations prescribed by the National A flem
bly, takes off one of the most atftive enemies to
the new Constitution.
The Court of Saxony likewise, reckoned a
mongst tJie most inveterate foes to the Revolu
tionists, according to the lad accounts from the
Continent, has acknowledged the nev# Constitu
tion, and accepted of the sent with
it. i
With regard to Great-Britain, little remarka
ble has occurred during the present vacation of
parliament, either to arouse the attention of the
people, or excite the curiosity of'the politician.
The late armament, like the baseless fabric of a
vision, has now almost vaniihed ; the greater part
of the (hips are paid cff; and the seamen being
discharged, such of them as prefer vice and idle
ness to industry and labour, will seek a liveli
hood by rapine and plunder. The expences of
this armament, which niuil be considerable, will
no doubt form a topic of discussion in course
of next session ; the abolition of the slave-trade
will, in all probability, be also revived; butamong other objeifts which may eng a g e atten
tion of the legislative body, we lincerely hope
that a worthy anil refpe<stable member will not
forget hip plan for checking the piogrefs of fe
male Prolfitutionâan evil which, in this coun
try, and particularly in the metropolis, has in
creased, is increaling, and ought to be diminish
ed . Though this evil cannot be abolished, it
may, however, be leflened. The eftablilhment
of a proper poiice, vigilant magistrates, atfliÂ»e
officers, and suitable punishment infli<sled upon
those who offend, will undoubtedly contribute to
promote so delirable an objeiS, and be of the ut
nioft benefit to society.
The arms of Great-Britain continue prosperous
in India. But it would be ralh, after the public
dispatch of Lord Cornwallis, to predict hidden
or unobftrtidled success. We therefore wait ihe
event with the solicitude and anxiety of good ci-
tizens
The marriage of the Duke of York with the
Princess Frederica of Prulfia, has taken place
sooner than we expeCied. This alliance is high
ly creditable to the Duke, and honorable to the
nation.' The union of the young prince of O
range with another branch of the fame family,
renders the connection still moredefirable. The
Duchess of York, if fame speaks truth, poflefles
every amiable qualily- that can adorn her sex.â
At Berlin her character is held in high estimation.
Her Royal Highness, it is to be hoped, will be
come rtie model of female imitation ; and her
example may banifli from the higher circles those
modish follies which at present prevail, & which,
if not criminal, are certainly ridiculous, and en
gage too much of their leisure and attention.
A printed paper has been distributed at Stock
holm, one of which the King found under his
feat, and of which the following is a copy :
" The Swedish nation will not go to war a
gaintl the French nation :âThe law only per
mits our afl'embly to make an offenfive war ; thy
oath obliges thee only to lead its troops for the
service of the nation ; and it is only in this ser
vice that we will fight against who ever offers to
offend or transgress the laws, and are in any wife
deficient in discharging their duty."
By the Nancy, Captain Anderfon, arVived yes
terday in the river, from Rouen, in Normandy,
â we are acquainted, that the utmost rejoicings
were observed in that city, so long celebrated
for its exertions in the cause of freedom, on the
day which the intelligence arrived oftheFrcnch
King's acceptance of the Constitution. Captain
Anderfon adds, that the people of that country
seem so attached to the late changes, that if he
may judge of all France by the peopleof Rouen,
all the powers of Europe united, will not be able
to make them change their political creed.
The price of bread in Paris still continues to
rife, and it is feared may interrupt the public
tranquillity. It is attributed to the failure of the
crops through the southern provinces of France.
In the north the harvest was gtjod.
The plague flill rages at Constantinople, and
still more in the Morea and in Egypt.
The different prefenrs made in Berlin, which
the Duke of Yook diltributed 011 account of his
marriage, cost the sum of 35,000 rix dollars.
The American funds are now much fought af
ter, and have risen within the two last months
from 92 to 120 per cent. The Dutch have fold
out very large Aims from our funds, to purchase
those of America.
Accounts from Canltantinople mention, that
every thing was reduced to order in that empire,
the rebels in Asia and Africa were entirely sub.
dued.
The Dutch have continued felling out of our
funds for fotne time, especially Bank Stock, so
that at the opening of the books last Thursday,
more transfers were made than ever were known
in one day before. The high rate at which thev
have fold will give a vast profit to the foreigners";
but it is a comfort to fee now little the price has
been affe<fted ; not above two or three per cent,
by the prodigious fumsfold out. Nothing proves
more the internal riches of country, than
this circumstance, that when the foreignerschufe
to fell out of out funds, the native stockholders
can take on themselves all that comes to market,
and as the interest of it will in future be paid to
and spent among ourselves, and not remitted a
broad, it will operate to keep up the course of
exchange in favor of this country.
The French king has begun to appoint the of
ficers of his new tioufehold. M. de Bri(lac is
commander in chief of the military department
M. de Harvelly is commander of the infantry,
and M de Point PAbbe of the cavalry.
The Empress of Rulfia has dilbanded the great
er part of her Asiatic troops, and distributed a

The Royal Academy of Berlin lield their' an

amongst several others, the King of Poland had

This morning John Hopkins, Esq. Lord May

The King of Spain has lately made confidera
hle promotions among the officers ot hi* army,
and lias intimated an intention ot railing the
pay of his troops. These are very obvious, but
only temporary expedients for fecui ing the obe
dience of troops, between whom and their com
manders there is no common intereit.
Spain seems to lake one leflon from ? ranee.
In order to etfet't the Revolution the more surely,
France encreafed the pay of the soldiers. Spain,
to secure their allegiance to Monarchy, has done
the fame. Ihus has the soldier fared well, whe
ther freedom or delpotifm prevails : but it may
be a bad military leflon, to adopt that cauie
which pays belt.
The Resolution of the Emperor are the nioft
fatal strokes that could poifibly have been given
to the hopes of the refugee princes ; for indepen

of their negociations elsewhere.

The French emigrants who were here a few
days ago, received a mefl'age from the Prince of
Conde, requeuing them to repair to him at
Worms ; but 011 their arrival in that city he was
not to be found, having let off for Aichaflen
bourg. By the despair and sadness visible a
mongst tliefe foreigners, it is imagined that the
which M. de Conde delired their at
tendance, was to communicate to them the bad
news of the acceptation of the new conltituuon
by his Molt Chriitian Majesty, which destroyed
every hope of succour from foreign powers to
restore the ancient form of government, and en
able them to return to their own country.
CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF R E P R ESENTATIVg S,
TUESDAY, December 27, 1791.
The Report of the Committee of the whole House on
the Pojl-Office Bill, was taken into confideratiou.
THE several amendments agreed to by the
committee were read. The firH fe<ftion, as
amended, after some further amendments, was
agreed toâthis fedtion details the roads. Second
amendment was to authorize the Pollmafter-Ge
neral to form contracts for carrying the mail on
cross-roadsâagreed. In the eighth fe<flion the
rates of portage are eftablilhed by an amend
ment, the lowest at fix cents for a single letter,
and-fhe highest twenty-five cents for the greatelt
dfltanceâagreed.
The substitution of " imprisonment for life,"
in lieu of the words " (hall fuffer death," for
robbing the mail, was objetfted to by Mr. Hart
ley, who observed, that for the protection of pro
perty, most countries have ena<sted penal laws.â
Those which have been the moll: sanguinary,
have, I think, not been the molt fuccefsful.
Those of a moderate complexion, have had a
better effedi, without sporting with the lives of
men.
While the Englilh government had irs influ
ence in America, the public mind in molt of the
Provinces was in favor of the former kind. Penn
sylvania was among the fiift exceptions. The
Quakers, who fiift fettled Pennfyl'vania, were
moderate in their manners and principles :
their penal code remained till the late revolu
tion. Ihe independence of America has led to
great inquiryâand we have ventured to change
our laws, and made thein less sanguinary this
has happened in a greater or lefler degree in raoft
of the States.
Life is not sported with, and the idea of con
finement and repentance strongly prevails. As I
have said the other dayâwe have altered our
laws with great luccefs in Pennsylvania.
What protedion are we to have to this pro
perty ?âWhat danger is it fubje# to !
The Poftinafter-General will doubtless take
security from the deputies he appoints, and of
those to whom the mail is etitrulled.
This is our securityâand there is fcavcely an
instance where a man is punished with death for
a mere breach of trust.
Fines and imprifomnent will be fufficient to
punish the party, and deter others from commit
ting the like bffence.
Ir is not like a robbery upon theperfon, taking
money. There is. in the latter, a complication
of offencesâPerfonal security as well as property
are involved, and thecrime inced. Perhaps
robbery ihould be puniflied with death ; Lut I
306
think fine and imprisonment fufficient for the
crime now under consideration. The public
mind would more approve of it than the punilh
ment of death.
Mr. Boudinot agreed in sentiment with Mr.
Hartley. He said that extreme punishments of
ten prevented a jury from convicfting a criminal.
Mr. Barnwell was of opinion thac a crime of
so pernicious a nature as robbing the mail, ought
to he punished with death.
Mr. Liverivore was also in favor of the origi
nal clause. He observed that a felon was never
so secure as when he was hanged out of the way.
In reply to Mr. Hartley's remarks re(pei r ting the
salutary effects ot the new system adopted in
Pennsylvania, he said he did not think they were
so apparent as had been reprefefitedâcrimes
were (lill committed, he said, in this city; for
that since the meeting of Congress, several at
tempts had beer! made to set it on fire. He said
that punishments, and capital ones, would always
be found necell'ary
Mr. Smith (N.H.) observed, that puniflimelits
ought to be proportioned to the offences com
mitted ; this is not done in the billâlie there
fore was under the neceUity of voting against the
clause, in order to having fouie modification of
it made.
Mr. Hillhoufe was in favor of the amendment
as reported by the committee.
Mr. Hartley moved an amendment to the
amendment, by driking out the words "for life"
âthis was seconded by Mr. Findley, and sup
ported by Mr. Kittera â who observed, that it was
a principle in jurisprudence not to too much
in the discretion of the judges. This amendment
was carried.âOn the queltion to agree to thefec
tion as thus amended,
Mr. Baldwin dated sundry particulars to shew
that the crimes and puniftiments referred to in
this bill, were on a totally different principle
from those mentioned in laws already passed by
the Legiflalure of the United States. He ihould
therefore vote against the amendment.
The question. being divided, the firft was on
striking out the clause, " shall fuffer death," â
it pafled in the negativeâso that the origiual
clause remains.
The twentieth fedtion, refpedting franking, Mr.
Wadfworth moved Ihould be struck out.
Mr. White observed, that he did not like the
clause as it (lands ; but lie was not for abolifliing
the privilege altogether. He read a clause whicU
very much reftritfted the business, and which he
fliould prefer to the feftion in the bill.
Mr. Hillhoufe said he had thought favorably
of the motion ; but on more mature considera
tion, and after hearing the arguments on the
fubjeift from gentlemen in favor of it, he was of
opinion it would be bed to retain the privilege.
Mr. Wadfworth observed, that finding a great
alteration had taken place in the sentiments of
gentlemen on the fubjett,' he had been induced
to renew the motion.âHe observed thac the evils
resulting from the pradiice, he had found on en
quiry, were much greater than he had supposed ;
but if the practice is retained, he fliould greatly
prefer the proposition of the gentleman from
Virginia. He doubted not that a revenue might
be raised from the poft-office, and in a way which
would be perfectly agreeable to the people, pro
vided abuses were kept out of the department, by
franks and other means.
Mr. Sturges replied to Mr. Wadfworth.âHe
obl'erved that it was not to be confiderd as a pri
vilege conferred on the members, but intended
solely for the benefit of the people ; it had not
been complained ofâwas productive of the mod;
fulutary consequence he did not think the
difad.vantages counterbalanced the numerous be
nefits resulting from it. As to the abuses men
tioned, he had greater confidence in the honor
and integrity both of the present members, and
those of any future national legislature, than to
suppose they would abnfe the privilege. Ke was
in favor of every neceflary rellricftion, but still
for retaining the fubllance of the ciaufe.
Mr. Gerry replied to Mr. Wadfworth.âKeob
ferved, in the course of his remarks, that Lhe ar
guments offered for abolishing the privilege,
were the most forcible in favor of retaining it.
Mr. Kittera observed, that though the revenue
of the poll office might at firft be afFe(fted, yet he
was of opinion that the correspondencies which
would ai ife from tliofe begun by franking, would
eventually contribute to an encreafe of the re-
venue.
[The further consideration of the amendments
was poltponed.]

Extract of a Utter front ft mceton, A'ew-jftifey, January 9, 1792
44 Ainidft ihe variety ot topics which every day bnngs into
conversation, none: has engaged the political circles in this town
more than the late unfortunate defeat of ouf western forccs under
General St. Clair. The event of this expedition was predicted
by many r fpe&able chara&ers, whole habits of life h ;ve given
them opportunities of forming correct opinions on military mat
ters. However eagerly the extirpation of the lavages was antici
pated by the utuefle&ing and inexperienced, theie initiated vete
rans saw things in a different light, and their apprehensions, from
the raw state of our new-iaifcd troops, as well as their total ig
noianceof the Indian method of warfare, have been but too lite
rally verified. This f,cond misfortune has (hewn lis that all at
tempts to reduce the savages must inevitably fail. We are gene
rally of opinion that the money expended in otfenfive operations
âIn carrying hostilities to the villages of th/it fugitive race of
people, who < migrate from place to place as convenience diieCts,
â would be\much more eligibly applied towards the extinction of
the heavy load of debt incurred by a jitjl and necefiary warâa war
to emancipate us from tiie (hackles of that power whose claims of
dependency and vaflalage were not moie inequitable than ours
with refpeft to the Indians of the western territory.
44 This contest appears unwarrantable as well on the principle
of justice as of policyâThe. fit ft mav be instantly decided by re
curring to the toea of pi poffeflion, by which the fir It occu
pantsare confnlered as legit mate proprietors of the foil, and all
attempts to difpofL is them must be pronounced ir.delenfible. As
to the policy of this territorial war, a variety of unanfwerahle
jeafons prcfent themlelvcs. A young empire, just emerging into
existence, embarrall''d with debts, a federal government, scarcely
eftsblifhed, suspÂ» nded 011 the flcnder thread of opinionâshew us
the evident necrffny of an undivided attention to the arts of
However pacific the alpett of the political expanle may now ap
pear, it is not impiobable that a pei fevtraifce in the present system
of public mea'ures with regard 10 the weft, may oocafion a con
siderable ferment, if wot difaffeÂ£bon.
4 * The ready, the virtuous, the magnanimous acquiescence of
our citizens in (;he pre lent impofuions on commerce, orig'nated
in an idea that the monies so raife-d would be expended frugally
and with care.
41 Tfie Indian warâa war thought unneceflfary, ineciuitable
and impolitic, is therefore objectionable, and hence it is inferred
that the enormous sums annually expended on so unjjftifijble a
business, is mere prodigality.
44 To fatisfy the public mind, and to retrieve the declining re
putation of our council*, i.t appears to be indifpenfibly rcquifite
jthat the military system (hould be totally reversed ; all idea of
fconaueft or expulsion should be rejected as fallacious, and such
measures pursued, as may give tranquility to the frontiers, and
reftote the public confidence. Themoneyfnow wafted in one year,
for raising troops to be hutchercd in the western forefts, would be
more than fuflicient to quiet the Indian tribes for twenty.' You
mav perhaps think my solicitude too great, and my apprchen
fions bordering on the chimerical, but I afi'ure you I feel the full
force of an honest conviction. I unequivocally aftert the neces
sity of some fpecdy change in public measuresâand do not hesitate
to avow it as my decided opinion, that unless an alteration of the
present system soon takes place, a pauial revolution of a certain
office wi II be the confiquence.

FROM A WORK NOT VET PUBLISHED,
LETTER I
Madam,
I AM not at all concerned to think that this letter may he les s
entertaining than fomeothers I intend to fend youâl know
you will think a kind letter from a friend as good as a diverting
one : He that gives you his mirth makes a much less prefentthm
he who gives you his -heart; and true friends would rathci fee such
thoughts as they communicate only to one another, than what
they offer promiscuously to the world. They who can set a right
value upon any thing, will prize one tender, well meant word, above
all that evci ma<le them laugh in their lives ; if I did not think (o
of you 1 fhouTd never bave taken much pains to endeavor to
please you by writing or any thing else ; wit I am sure I wantâ
at least in the degree I fee others have it, for not content with
fuuffing the candle with their own fingers* they are willing to
fingeothets with thÂ« fnuffâ but I would be thought to have iome
qualities that mav be (asoccafion may require) of more comfort
to myfelf, and ot more service to my friends. I would cut off
my own head if it had nothing bur wit in it, and tear out my
own heart, if it had no better dispositions than to love only my
felf, and ridicule and deceive my neighbors in sport. I know you'll
think it an agreeable thing to hear that I have written three whole
Cantos of my Persian Tale, the Medead, and that it will appear in a
couple or three months 111 a neat pamphlet.â If it be tolerable,
the world may thank you for it, for if I could have seen you eve
ry day, and imagined my company could have pleased you as
well, I should scarce have thought it worth my while to please
the world. How many verses, and telltale letters (though not like
the Bilhop'sot *****) could 1 gladly have left unfinifhed, had I
been permuted to pals those hours more pleajingly. Whatever
some may think, fame is a thing I am much less covetous of, than
your friendfhip, (or that I hope will last all my life, the other
I cannot anfwerfor; âWhat it they both should grow greater al
ter my death ? Alas! like the fame of old Davy the ballad finger,
my papers would have few correspondents, fewer readers, and no
female friends at all, they would both be of no advantage to me.
Think therefore ferioully on this, and love me as well as ever you
can while 1 live, and continue in good dispositions. Your'.s as

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
It would be candid in those who mention the great duties
which they lay are laid by Congress, to let it appear, (hat some
of the highest of them are not expelled to produce any revenue,
but are calculated to prevent the home demand for raw articles
we can raise and procure by our own industry from being taken
away by rival articles, sent hither by foreigners so the injury of
our farmers, filhermen, Sec. The following duties, whieh are
among the highdt, aic direst bounties on agriculture, viz. On
cheese four cents, malt ten cents, indigo twenty-five cents, hemp
fifty-lour cents. Sec. Sec. The following articles are so easily
manufaftuied from native materials, that the duties on them are
indirect bounties on agriculture, and the landed lntereft, viz.
Tallow candles two cents, soap two cents, wax candles fix cents,
malt liquors five cents, cordage 100 to 150 cents, manufa&ured
tobacco, tanned leather, eaithen nnd ware, milliard, &
ten per centum. The duties on coal, iron, lead, See. are boun
ties to the landholders, and will yield little revenue. .Several
other duties are mere protections to manufactures, and do not
produce anything of confequenee to the federal chest, fnch as
the duties on shoes and boots, manufactures of coppcr, spikes,
wool cards, paper, gold and silver wares, carriages, wooden fur
niture, tin wares, See. Sec.
We are told that <c the whole country" is laid under a heavy
excise. To be sure, if one state or one county pays the excise,
" the whole" mull, because by our fair and equal constitution no
gart of the union can be called upon to pay a public contribution
but by a law which applies to the whole. As to the " heaviness"
of the excise, it will puzzle the molt knowing man to mention
in what country so light an excise exists, though it will be easy
to find an example of one twelve tunes as heavy abroad.
The United States never sent forth so great a value of produce
in any two years, as in 1790 and 1791, nor did the merchants in
this country ever in any two years order out and import so great
a value of goods as in those two yeais, nor did they ever own so
many tons of (hipping, nor were the veflels ever more generally
good and handsome ; yet it isfuggefted that " trade is daggering
under the impost."
Jt is the opinion of many judicious persons in d fferent parts of
this country, (hat lands improved and unimproved have advanced
in price from 20 to 30 per cent, since the year 1789. City pro
peity is every where more advanced. Old branches of bufincfs
are extended, none have fallen off, new branches are daily ap
pearing in different quarters. These things will yield to men of
ibber thought fatisfa&orv proof that the general fvftcm of Con
gress is beneficial to the general ihtercfts.
If the paflions of children arc not controuled and regulated by
their parents when young, the !a ws multcpntroul them when ! h y
come to be men â there is no other alternative. F>r that indul
gence which too many children are the unhappy fubje&s of, nur
tures vices, which, in riper years, without the reftramt of the civil
magiftra.e, would render them the pests of society. In a free
country, wh. re the law is fuprerne, the above remark applies to
rich and poorâlo the former oerhaps with the greatcft force.

Extrafl of a litter from a g:ntlim:r. in Bop an to his

" The rapid and continued rife of real eftare
is ascribed to the great redundancy of cash, and
the efficacy and (lability ot government. Rents
and landed property here have advanced more
than forty per cent, within the lalt fix months,
and are (till rising ; as the moniedmen want em
ployment for the floods of cash that have been
lately pouring in upon them. How different is the
present fitnation from that a few years since.
Men were then facrificing their lands for cajl)â
they are now as eagerly vesting their cash in lands.
Thus you fee, each one will have his day,âat

ALBANY, January 9.
Let quakers petition, and Ipeculative charac
ters who glide only 011 the furface, fay what
they will on the fobjed of an Indian warfare,
the plain English of the business is, that we can
never obtain a permanent peace with these bar
barians till we have reduced them to the feet of
CongressâThe origin and justness of our eaufe
â¢re now totally out of the qoeftion.âlt is indeed
to be severely lamented, that we could not have
obtained a peace by fair treaty âbat every one
who knows any thing of the nature of savages,
moil know that this deiirable event can never be
obtained, while ttfey are riding triumphant in
the arms of victory.âlt will therefore be the po
licy and interest of Congreft, in our own defence
to make a decisive effort the enfujng campaign.
It is supposed, 6,000 men to begin an early cam
paign by penetrating into the heart of tbeiT coun
try from the Ohioâand half that number to pro
ceed through the interior of this ftatc, either to
eftabliih polls on Lake Erie, or to form a jnn&i
on with the southern army so as to diftraifi the
savages between two firesâwould be completely
competent to every purpofe âbut it would per
haps be better for America, even to double this
force, rather than to linger along two or three
year's feeble and nndecifive campaigns.
KNOXVILLE, November 19.
About the 10th inft. a company going through
the wilderness to Catnberland, was met on the
road by a party of Indians. Upon firft fight thfe
men (being seven in number) rode off with the
utino(t precipitation, and left the women (four
in number) who were sb terrified that they were
unable to proceed. The Indians came up, (hook
hands with them, and told them they (honld not
be hurr, made a fire for ttiefti, and caught a stud
horse, that one of the company had jumped from,
which they tied to a tree. They then went af
ter n fmail boy who was attempting to make off,
and brought him back to the women. Four of
the conipar.y did not Hop till they reached the

men after some time.
