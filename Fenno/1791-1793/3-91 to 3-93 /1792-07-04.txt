"DUBLIN, April I.
In tlie'couife of ihe last week, at
Ballinamore, the feat of Thomas
Ormlby, Esq.. four of his labourers
were found dead, having been fuito
cated from the rarification of the air
in the room where they slept : This
.melancholy consequence arose from
a lighted turf having been left burn
ing where there was no chimney for
the egress of the heated air.
There were eight men in the room,
all of whom were infenflble : but
from the fkilful means which weie
adminiflered, four of theni were re
itored to life : The state of the o
thers baffled every attempt of reco
very which (kill could suggest, or
humanity employ ; the organs of re
spiration had so long ceased to act,
that ho new itnpulfe could be given.
The full a if* of liberality from a
Protestant Government toÃomanCa
tholics on the continent, was done
by the late King of Prussia, who built
a molt elegant church, farnilhect it
with an organ, and every suitable de
coration for the tif; offuchCatholics,
llrangeis or fubjei'U as were refidem
at Berlin. The compliment was soon
returned by the thiee ecclefiallical
electors of Mentz, Trieves, and Co
logne, the Bithop of Hohenloe, Saltz
burgh &c. So that Lutherans and
Calvinilts, are not only tolerated,but
protected and caielled in all those
itates.
LONDON, May i
HOUSE OF COMMONS, April 30,
A debate, or rather conversation on
the fubjetft of a reform in the Brit ill)
reprel'entation'took place in the Honfe
of Commons this day. Mr. Grey in
troduced the business ; in the course
of his obfei vaiions he reminded Mr.
Pitt of his former declarations on this
point, and considered him as pledg
ed to give a reform his lupport.
The example of a neighboring king
dom, whatever it may fuggelt to o
ther gentlemen, only tended to con
firm him in the opinion, that the de
feats of a conliitution lhould always
be reformed before they amounted 10
a cause for the conliitution being fub
â¢verted. lie gave notice, that he
should, at an eaily period of the en
faing fefficn, lubinit a motion for a
Parliamentary Reform, and hoped
gentlemen Would not, in the inter
val, omit turning their moll serious
thoughts to lb intei elling a fnbjett.
Mr. Pi! t acknowledged that his
opinion was changedâat the time he
mentioned a reform, the American
war raged, Parliament and the peo
ple then appeared to be opposed, to
rellore union and harmony at that
time, he proposed the measure ; but
such were the resources to be found
in the conlVitmion, that the situation
of the counny was now changed from
indigence and tlillrefs, to affluence
and comfort : The grearefl pnlfible
good therefore which the allotment
of man was capable of receiving,
could amount to 110 moie than that
when he found himfelf happy, he
should take measures to render thai
happiness as secure and duiable as
may be r He objected to the time and
manner of briuginjg forwaid the bu-
fineli
As to the time there were the mofl
serious objections, when miichievous
politicians wei e leti ing opinions afloat
which inuft in their natuie be fiibver
five of all order and government â
when the avowed partisans of this
measure were pel sons who acknow
ledged theinfelves to be the enemies
of monarchyâthe aflerters of oui
having no con Hi tut ion w hat everâi lit
haters of arillocracyâthe enemies jol
religion, anil men who were inflexi
bly averse to all subordination and
distinction of ranks whatever.
The manner of bringing it forward
he a Hot honght highly i epreheniible ;
where members, withdrawing theni
felve's from that doty and refponft
bility which their Itations imposed
upon them, fought teditious alloca
tions, deserted the regular Pariia
mentary line of conduct, and put
their names in ihe public newspapers
to resolutions framed in dangerous
and irregular meetings.
Mr. Fox said he held the fame o
piuion now with respeCt to a l'arlia
mentary reform which he had con
llantly and uniformly maintained.
He contended that theie never was a
time mote proper for a reform than

for whatever may he the present dis
tress of Franceâwhether by applying
to abltratft principles, they had in ttie
end produced no government (which
was by no means his opinion) yet the
ancient despotism was so deiellable,
that it ought certainly to be removed,
whatever facrifice it may occasion,
France, howeve", furnifhed 110 fubjei't
for ihe imitJtion of this country. It
was the great excellence and glory of
our conltitution, that i was always
fubjetfl to reform, and susceptible of
improvement, and in ihe advance
ments which reason and philosophy
were making in the progress of hu
man Itience, renovation anil amend

effei't. In Fra ice, no repair was fuf
ficient ; ihe whole fabric inuft be de
ll royed. But of our co >lli. ulion there
is not a part which has not more than
once been reformed.âThe preroga
tives of ihe crown, and the privileges
of both houses of the leg'flaiure, had
undergone various modifications, as
circumllances required them, from
time to time.
Mr. Burke maintained, that there,
was not in this country any focietyi
or body of men who were openly as- j
fociated (or the avowed purpose of
fuppoiting the cause of defpotifiu ;
but that t here were societies for the
support and promotion of anarchy,
and the extinction of our prefeut cun
ftiiution, was known to every one,
and even fantlioned by known and
refpetftable names. â Here (being cal
led upon to name) tie mentioned,
amongst others, Mr. Walkei, of Man
chelter, who was forward in circula
ting Pa i ne's book, com aim ng the mtolt
grois as well as abfmd libels on the
conflitution. Whether the man in
quell ion was an Ameiican or not he
could not tell âHe appeared to him
in the light of an atnphi bioos kind of;
an animal, neither quite French, Kn-j
glilli, nor Irilh, but running about!
with ale>tnels to fee what mifhief
m.iy puflibly be done in any. Kisj
plans had lb far succeeded, thai a con
federacy was formed between the;
difaffected here and the J icoliin Club!
in France, that race of Regicides and I
Monllers, whom it was impoflible to
think of without horror. To (hew
the fort of men with which this con
federacy was formed, he gave a CU'
rious description of the p, efent Na
tional Alfeuibly of France. Out of
700 men, joo were attornies, and fl
eers low practitioners in the law.
1 lie grearelt part of the remainder
ronfiited ot (hop-boys, journeymen,
and adventurers. He could point out

meu imitate them, but let them view
iheir comparative situation before
they formed their opinions.
From the turbulent disposition of
the times, he thought this an impro
per uiuiiteiic to agitate such questions.
If the prefeut quertion came in tlie
.hape of a direct pronofition, he would
for one uppofe it ; but con)ing as it
did in an indefinite shape, which
ifrtve encouragement to the views of
lie boldest and molt profligate adven-
Vners, he could not let it pass with
hii receiving from him the moll fe
iious disapprobation.
Mr. Kox recapitulated some argil
uients in wjiich he had been miftin
dei Hood. With regard to Mr. Paine's
writings, he again alledgedthat they
were libels ngainft the conlhtution.
Mr. Burke agreed with Mr. Kox.
whom he termed his Hon. friend
The writings in quettion were libels,
but not fcandalons ; for any man,
provided he were amenable to the
laws of the country, might declare
his sentiments of the conllitution.
Mr. Erikine praising the hiltory of
the confliiution, said that as a law
yer, and as a man, he was bound to
maintain its original principles. Ad
drefling himfelfto Mr. Pitt, he affinn
ed, that ilie people of this country
were not adequately reprelented in
Parliament ; and challenged him to
vote a relolution to that effect. Jt
the conilitution had remained unim

dv end to the American troubles. Has
Hot Mr. Pitt receded from his former
principles > He laid the foundation,

1 his was lite chief reason for union
which now attracted their attention.
Am I to luppofe (fays he) that men
will content to lop off the rotten bo

Mr. Pitt Itate the particular fei vices

EDICT of the Kino Â«/ Denmark.
WE) Christian VII, by the grace of God,
king'of Denmark and Norway, &c. &c.
make known by theft presents, That consider
ing the circumstances which occur in the slave
trade on the coast of Guinea, and in the trans
portation of the negroes from thence to our
Weft-India iflandi, and imprefied with the idea,
that it would be in every refpe<st beneficial and
profitable, if the importation of new negroes
from the coast of Guinea could be avoided, and
our Weft India islands, in process of time, cul
tivated by the negroes born and bred in the
llland', accustomed from their youth to the
manner of labour, the climate, and the difpoii
tion of their matters; we, in consequence, have
made fcnous enquiries how far, and wbfn it
might be poffiblq to accomplish the abolition'of
the laid trade- From the result of these en
quiries, we are convinced that it is poflible
and will be advantageous to our Welt-India
lflands, to desist from tlie further purchase of
new negrdes, when once the plantations are
flocked with a Sufficient number for propaga
tion, and the cultivation of their land ; when
pecumanr afl&ancc can be given to those who
want to purchase negroes for lheir eft.-.tes; and
if proper encouragement was to be ji'. ju to
marriage among the negroes, and due attention
paid to their inltruction and morals.
In order therefore, to withdraw our Weft-
India po:i'efHoii3 from thp state of dependance
under which they have heitherto been, and
now are, with reTpcCt to the importation of ne
groes, and to make the importation of negroes
unneceirary in future, we declare our most gra
cious will on this fubjeft, and order as follows:
1. Fro.Titlu commencement of the year 1803,
we forbid any of our fubjedts to carry on the
slave trade form the coast of Africa, or any
other place, except in our Weft-India islands }
so that, after that period, no negro man or wo
man, either from that coast or other foreign
places, will be allowed to be purchufbd bv or
for our fubjefts, or to be transported in our.
fubjefts fhps, neither must they be brought to
our Weft-India islands for sale ; and every
tranfaftion contrary to this prohibition, Jhall,
after that period, be deemed unlawful.
2. In the mean time, from the present, un
til the end ofthe year 1802, it is permitted to
all foreign nations, without exception, and un
der all flags, to import negro men and women
from the coast into our Weft-India islands.
3- For every healthy and flout negro, man
or woman, who, during that period, shall be
thus imported into our Weft-India islands, we
permit the following quantities of"raw sugars
to be exported from our islands to foreign pla
ces, either in our own or foreign ships, within
a year after the importation of such negroes,
viz. For every full grown negro, man or woman,
23001b. weight may be exported ; and for eve
ry half grown negro half that quantity, or
iooolb. weight, without any difference with re
gard to sex ; but nothing is allowed for the im
portation of children.
4. The duty which is fixed by the ordinance
of the 9th of April 1764, and 12 th of May 1777
(which ordinances, in every refpeft that regards
the slave trad.', are hereby repealed), on the
importation of slaves, we rnoft graciously tatye
off, with regard to the negro women, who may
be hereafter imported; but, on the other hand,
we impose a duty of one half per cent, more
than "what is already stipulated, on the sugars
which fliall be exported to foreign places, for
the purchase oi such negro men and women as
are imported.
S- It is, moreover, our will, in order to efta
biiih an exait proportion among the dilferent
sexes, that from the beginning of 1795, and af
ter, the negro women and girls whowork in the
field, and are not house negroes, fliall pay no
poll tax ; but, on the contrary, from the above
mentioned period, a double poll tax lit,ill be
exacted for every negro man.
6. From this present period we forbid, in
the ftrongeit manner, all exportation of negro
men or women from our Weft-India islands,
they alone being exempted from this prohibition
who are expelled bv law ;or such our go
vernor-general and council in the
may, upon very extraordinary occafiofis, think
proper according to circumstances, to permit
to depart-
Wherefore, this, our royal will, being made
known, we order all and every one to conform
to it.
Given at our palace of Ghriftianfburgh, in
our royal palace of residence, Copenhagen,
the 16 th of March, 1792, under our royal
hand and seal.

Sixteen years have elapsed fmce the United

(See Universal Museum, for May, 1792.)
" 1 ' ie day is pad. The second day of July,
*776, will be a memorable epocha in the hiftorv
of America. lam apt to believe it will be ce
lebrated, by succeeding generations, as the great
anniversary feftival. It ought to be comme
moi ated, as the day of deliverance, byfolemn
aÂ£ts of devotion to almightv God. It ought to
be solemnized with pomp, shows, games, sports,
guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from
one end of this continent to the other, from this
time forward for everâYou will think me
tranfportcd with enthusiasmâbut lam not. 1
am well aware of the toil, and blood, and trea
sure that it will coll us, to maintain this decla

yet, through all the gloom, I can fee the rays of
light and plor âI can fee that the end is more
than worth all the means; and that pofteritv
will triumph, although you and-1 may rue,
which I hope we shall not."

Extract from tae Presidlnt'i; Specch to tiie
fcrlt Legiilatuie oftho United State- :
" There is no truth more thoroughly esta
blished than that there exifti in the "economy
and course of nature, an indiflolub e â union be
tween virtue and happicefs; bctveen duty and
advantageâbetween genuine maxims of an lio
neft and magnanimous policy, and the solid re
wards of public prosperity and felicity Since
we ought to be no less persuaded that the pro
pitious fniiles of Heaven can never be expected
on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of
order and right, which Heaven itfelf has ordain
ed. And since the preservation of the sacred
Fire of Liberty ; and the destiny of tbe repub
lican model of government, are justly consider
ed as deeply, perhaps as Jtiully staked on the ex
periment entrusted to the Amencanpeople."
This day, being the birth-day of our country,
the fame will be duly noticed by rejoicings and
feftivities similar to those which have hereto
fore celebrated the return of this auspicious
anniverlary.
The uniform volunteer companies, and the
corps of artillery of the city will parade at the

in the evening there will be a splendid exhibi

T he time may arrive, fays Pvlr. Necker,when
fatigued of that ambition which agitates go

turn their views to the great principles of hu

the witness of this happy revolution, they may
at least be allowed to be unanimous in offering
up their vows for the perfection of the social
virtues, and for theprogrefs of public beneficial
inflitutions.
ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
Eaucation is the discipline of human nature;
without which mankind, 44 born like the wild
alfes coif," encreafe in years and strength, to
little better purpose than to befcourges to each
other.
Providence, with existence, gives us the
means to improve that existence for all the pur
poses of mental, social and political happiness 5
Jut if, like 44 the field of the sluggard," these
means are abandoned to the mere impulse of
natural exertion, it is in vain to expedl those
delicious fruits which depend on the labour of
cultivation.
The blelling of liberty was never a cheap
purchase in the firit inftanccâbut to perpetuate
the invafiiable pofleflion, with improvements,
and to hand it down through a fucccffion of
ages unimpaired, requires not only a frequent
recurrence to firft principles, hut also the conti
nual vigilance of an enlightened series of patri-
Jp ts â an vf frequent facrificesef private advan
tages on the altar of the public good- This
cannot be provided for in aiiy other way, thaa
by making ample and cheap "provision for the
education of the great body of the people.
The tranquility of a despotic government
depends on the ignorance of the general mass of
the people, and the monopoly of learning in the
hands of a fewâThe peace of a free republic
depends on an universal diffufion of knowledge.
Many persons seem to suppose that those who
j agree witli them in political opinions, have made
a monopoly of patriotismâhence the intolerant
felf-fuflicientfentiments of many modern poli
tical writersâWhile they set up their own dog
mas as the infallible creed of political ortho
doxy, they condemn aii who diifer from tberii
as fools or knaves. One would be led to sup
pose from these writers, that mankind have
groped in Egyptian darkness from the creation
to the present time, without one gleam of light
to chear the gloomy paiTage of exillence.
It is to be acknowledged that the present is
an age of improvement inmanyeflentialobjefU
of human concernâBut while we ftudv the vo
lume of human nature, let us not pass over the
chapter of experience ; for what has been, is,
and will- bt agair.âVirtue alone is the only
foundation .of confidenct, that will not fail us.

THE CELL OF SOLITUDE.
D IM as the fleeting visions of the night,
A dark lower tott'ring clos'd th' extended view ;
While round its spires, illum'd with feeble light,
The flitting bat, and boding raven flew.
Rent was the hanging archâthe domes o'erthrown ;
Nor tread was heard along the distant pile,
Save when the troubled ghost with hollow moan,
Strode flow'.v o'er the long rtffounding isle.
One only cell withstood the waste of time,
'Twas where a turret rear'd its moss clad brow ;
Gloomy it flood in falling pomp iublime,
And fliow'd the mould'ring wrecks around below.
Here on her hand her drooping head reclin'd ;
Wrapt in fwect musing fat the lonely power;
Penftve (he fat and heard the howling wind
Die, faintly murm'ring round her ivy'd bower.
In graceful ringlets fell her amber halt!
Black as ihe raven's plumes her mantle flow'd ;
No cupids round her fan'd ilie sullen air;
No ftftive echo checr'd her lone abode.
Bnt the wild harp that to the blast complains,
Sooth'd with melodious plaint her raptur'd ear j
Deep, solemn, awful roll'd the varying strains,
Such drains the feraphiins with transport hear.
FROM THE COLUMBIAN CENfINEL,
MR. RUSSELL,
TT is said to be in agitation, immediately on
A the arrival of official accounts of o|en hostili
ties between the Patriots of France, and their
enemies, to set oil foot a plan for rai in<* a body
of American Volunteers, to embark asÂ°foon as
possible for France. The idea was tic fuggefled
from a doubt that the French Freemi 11 are not
able to cope with their slavish enemii âor that
they wanted any thing to Simulate tl ;m to glo
rious conquest ; but merely to evince the grati
tude of Americansâand once more o mingle
their blood with those of their allies, n defence
of the rights of human nature. Shot d the idea
be carried into effect, there is not a oubt that
the government of the United State! and the
individual Hates, will make ample pf>vifion for
the support and transportation of Patriot
Volunteers. Ihe Legislature of Maflachufetts,
now in session, would do themselves immortal
honor, by being the firft to provide, on their
part, in cafe the project succeeded, for those
who would go from this Hate. To ibis fubietft
their attention is requested, by
