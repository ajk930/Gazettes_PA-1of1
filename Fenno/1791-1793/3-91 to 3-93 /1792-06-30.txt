LONDON, May i.
FRANCE, governed by the violent
democracy known under the
name of Jacobins, has at length de
nounced war against the King of
Hungary and Bohemia. The afpe<ft
of Europe is so new that we know
not what to conjecture, though at the
fame time so portentous, that we can
not but fear foine general commoti
on, and consequently foine general
calamity. War between Germany
and France seems now unavoidable;,
as both parties are too proud and too
confident of support, to listen to
terms of mutual concession or cotn
promife. Could the voice of reason
and moderation be heard amidst the
tumults of paflion and the clangor of
arms, we would, in the character of
friends to human nature, and impar
tial fyedators of all political contefls,
[Whole No. 551.]
whether at home or abroad, earnestly
recommend peace to the contending
parties in France, on the ground of
a general amnefly, and the establish
ment of a third branch in the legifia
ture, by the infiitntion of a chamber
for the ancient nobility, and the dig
nified clergy, analogous to our House
of Peers. But the present temper of
the parties concerned does not admit
of such councils. It will, no doubt,
be the firft ohjetfl of what we shall
call the monarchical party, including
under that denomination both the
over-powered nobility and clergy in
France, and the sovereigns of other
countries who have espoused the cauft
of the fugitive princes, to seize some
strong port or pods in France, ascen
ters of union, or rather a re union,
of those who are friends, if not of
the antient government, yet of mo
derate reformation. It will, in like
manner, be the obje<fl of the French
democracy to crols the Rhine, and e
reiS the standard of liberty in the
Netherlands, in Liege, in Holland
too perhaps, and in other countries.
The allies will seek for friends and
adherents in France, the Nascent
Republic in the Low Countries and
in Germany, and all around them.
Whether will the enthusiasm of free
dom, or the combined efforts of many
and mighty powers pievail ? That is
the problem now to be determined
by policy and by arms.
It would have been full time enough
if the National Aflembly had waited
till the new King of Hungary had
come to some positive measure of hos
tility against the French, before they
had declared war ; for as it is, the
National Afl'embly must appear in no
other light than that of having de
clared an offenfive war against Ger
many, merely on the ground of the
declared opinion of the Kingof Hun
gary, as to the points on which he
desired to have the Conftitutton of
France amended, though he had ac
tually taken no ineafure to enforce
that opinion by an overt ai\, except
the 1.-ationing of part of his military
ftrengch might fa be conftrued,which
would hardly be allowed so long as
he refrained from any direct attack
on the poflefiions of France.
The daring republicans who adopt
the dotftrines of Thomas Paine in
this country, are proceeding to ex
tremities little short of madness, and
under the pretence of supporting the
cause of freedom, are everyday guil
ty of the grofTeit treason. Surely
with the inoft perfetft 2eal for the li
berty of the press, it mull be the wish
of all who are attached to the consti
tution, to fee the proper spirit of con
troul exerted, and indeed it is (hew
ing a true regard for the sacred free-*
dom of the press to prevent it front
being profaned by the scandalous li
cence which fonie desperate writers
afliime, who have no end in view but
a general confufion, by which alone
they are likely to escape from the
horrors of famine, or a gaol.
Government ir is to be hoped, are
not idle though silent, with refpedt
to the daring liberties which certain
factious writers take with the Con
ftirution, and in particular with the
executive branch which they are in
ceflantly endeavoring to bring into
contempt by a general attack upon
monarchy.
Le-ters received on Saturday by
the Flanders mail, are so far inter
eftinj; in a public light, as they bring
us information that the disputes which
have so long subsisted in the Nether
lands arc at length brought to a hap
py termination.
In a fliort debate, which occnrrrd.
on Friday last in the National Afletn
bly of France, after the prnpnW -if
war, a fallyof one Member produced
much applause.â"When
First," was read as the name of tbeKing of Hungary, " Read," said he,
Francis the last tor there will be no
more Kings of Hungary."
The States of Brabant afTemblec! on
the 17th inllant, when they agreed
to grant the subsidies withheld from
the two late Emperorsâand made so
lemn profeffions of attachment and
fnbmiliion to their new sovereign.
The only boon they a iked in return,
was the restoration of the five former
Counsellors of the Council of Bra
bant, which is to be granted. Van
der Noot and Van Eupen are not in
cluded in this amnesty. The clergy
have likewise profefled their attach
ment to the new King, and on every
occasion declaim against the new or
der of things in France, which they
are determined to oppose, lead the
French fliould endeavor to commit
the fame violation on their property
as they have on the estates of their
own clergy. In this moment of in
vasion, the reconciliation of all par
ties is a very material point gained,
in securing the Netherlands to their
lawful sovereign.
Our Mini dry are resolutely deter
mined not to interfere in the medi
tated war on the Continent. As long
as the honor and security and true
policy of England allow it, they are
determined to refrain from all holti
lity. It is evidently for the interest
of the country to remain in peace ;
but at the fame time, it is known to
all the world, that this country is
prepared for war.âWe wifli earneit
ly for a continuance of tranquility,
but are prepared for the mod reso
lute and vioknt attacks of an open
enemy,
This morning about one o'clock a
terrible fire broke out in a store ware
house belonging to Mr. Griffin, in
Evangelist Court, Water Lane, Black
friars, near Apothecaries Hall. Ma
ny of the back houses being very old,
and the wind blowing high, the flames
raged with so much fury that but few
of the unfortunate people had time
to do more than get out of their hous
es in their fliirts.
About fifty hoiifes have been de
stroyed, with almost all the furniture
which they contained.
A letter was received last week from
Dr. Willis, by one of his relatives in
the country, wherein he exprefleshis
expectation of returning to England
in a few weeks, and of leaving his
Royal patient perfectly reltored to
her health.
The three grand armies of France
are in motion ; but as yet we do not
learn that they have committed any
acl of hostility. General Brown, a
man of great military skill, is to be
Commander in Chief of the Austrian
army.
An express arrived last night at the
Secretary of State's Office, with an
account of a <u(penlion of iioftilities,
for ten days, having been agreed on
between the French and Aultrians.â
A letter was written by Louis to his
nephew the King of Hungary, pres
sing him very strongly to an accom
modation with the National Aflembly;
the (ufpenfion was proposed, in order
to have time for an answer from the
Court of Vienna; so that there are
yet hopes, among the more moderate
people in Paris, that a war between
the two countries may be averted.
In 1745 the French took Oftend,
after a ten day's siege. If they should
now attempt it, they will be most
likely to succeed by a coup-de-main.
M. Perigord, late bishop of Autun,
arrived in town on Sunday last, ac
companied by M. Garat, editor of the
Journal de Paris, M. Dumout, of Ge
neva, and M. Gallois, all members of
the high patriotic party.
They dined with M. deChauvelin,
the new ambalTador, who is to pre
lent his credentials to the King to
morrow, and to the Queen on Thurs
day.
M. Perigord is attached to the em
bally. He will entirely superintend
the condudt of the nominal minilter ;
and as far as age may be supposed to
Jiave ripened political wisdom, he is
undoubtedly chosen with great pro
priety.
M. Mienhard, the Secretary of Le
gation, is by birth a German, but his
regeneration into Patriotic Purity is
said to be complete.
Orders have been actually sent from
Paris for a body of troops to march
to Dunkirk immediately, and to be
reinforced by about 4000 men ingar
rifon there. The situation of Dun
kirk is so near, as to be not more than
fix hours quick march to Oftend,
which is very weakly garrisoned, and
could not refilV any regular attack
from a large body of forces. The
orders given have been so perempto
ry to make thegreateft dispatch, that
we may expect to hear every day of
the French troops being before that
place. The policy of this attack is
evident, and could not be better con
ceived. The French, by taking Of
tend, will destroy the nest of priva
vateers which are fitting out there
with the greatelt alacrity, and must
injure French trade very materially.
A letter from an Englifli gentleman at Pe
terfburgh, gives a very curious account of the
present ftatc of that court. The murder of
the Kiug of Sweden made a strong impreflion
on the Empress ; but it gave such an alarm to
the Arch-duke, as was perceptible to every one.
He talked publickly of plans being formed to
carry him off; and in a converi'ation with her
majesty, he spoke in the most unineafured terms,
deporting himfelf. fays the letter, "neither as
a son, nor as a fubjeft." The health ofthe Em
p' ess is not merely on the decline. There is
evidently a thorough break up of the constitu
tion. Her death, though it will make no
change in the abject condition of the people,
will be the .-era of a material change in the em
pire, for it is likely to be divided.
A young man was lately executed at Brussels
forenlifting men, not for the Auftvian service.
This execution, instead of striking terror, has
excited indignation. Emigrations and tiefer
tiens art: more frequent than ever.
A letter From Gibraltar fays, the brother of]
the late Emperor of Morocco is not dead of his
wounds, as has been reported. He is now per
fectly recovered; and there are actually two!
Emperors of Morocco, viz. Muley Ilhani, who
was proclaimed at Morocco, and Muley Mama,
who has been acknowledged Emperor at Tan
giers and Tetuan.
The [adics of France have left off rouge ; the
chimney-sweepers of England having adopted
| it, ought to be afufficient reason for our British
fair quitting their disguises and trusting to na
ture. There is no colour so attractive as that
which
' Nature's own fwest and cunning hand laid on.'
Our divine poet vcrv properly calls it
' Celeitial rofv red, Love's proper hue.'
THE PUBLIC EDUCATION OF FRANCE.
In the plan of public inftrufticn, fubmirtcd to
the National Assembly by M. Condorcet, and
which is printed for the use of the members,
there is the following memorable pafiage :
" The principles of morality taught in the
fchoob, and in the institutions, shall be those
which,founded on natural sentiment and reason,
belong equally to all men. The eonftitution, in
recognizing the right that each individual has
to chufe hi; religious worlhip, and in eftablilh
ing an entire eqnaiitv among all the inhabitants
of France, does not permit that any mode of
religious worlhip ihall be adopted, which exclud
ing the children of one part of the citizens,
would destroy the equality of advantages, or
would give to particular dogmas an advantage
contrary to the freedom of opinions. It is
therefore rigorously neceflary to separate from
morality the principles of all particular reli
gions, and not to admit into public inftruftion
t:-.e teaching of any mode of religious worlhip.
Every one of these ought to be taught in the
temples by its proper ministers. The parents,
whatever may be their creed, whatever may be
their opinion, as to the necessity of fueh or such
religion, can then, without repugnance, fend
their children to the national establishments,
and the state will not, as heretofore, usurp the
rights of confidence, under the pretext of en
lightening and directing them."
STOCKHOLM, April 20
The minor King and the Regent
have received an address from the
four orders of Stockholm, exprefllng
their grief at the late event. It was
composed of nine deputies of the No
blefle, four of the Clergy, five of the
Bourgeoife, and seven of the order
ofPeafants.âThe confufion is daily
subsiding, and the government are
relaxing gradually from the severe
discipline which was eflablifhed.

VIENNA. April ij.
A body of troops, under the com

into Lower Austria, attended by 21
field pices, 6 pounders, two 12 pound

SALEM, June 19
ESSEX BANK
Will begin to discount on Monday
next, if no unexpected occurrence oc
casions a delay.
This Bank is kept in the fame build
ing with the Cultom House, in Bank-
Street, Salem, a few rods from the
Sun Tavern.
The following gentlemen have been
chol'en officers of it, viz.
Mr. William Gray, jun. President
Capt. George Dodge, Edward Pul
ling, Esq. Mr. John Norris, Jacob
Aftiton, Esq. Capt. William Orne,
and Capt. Joseph White, Directors.
Mr. James King, Caffiier.
We are allured that J t 'peculation, that
bane of industry and integrity, is no
part of the system on which this Bank
is instituted. Situated in the midst
of an enterprizing, commercial and
manufacturing people, it is intended
to facilitate the operations of their
industry ; and we underftandthat in
fant manufactures will be the parti
cular objects of its favor. By this
inllitution, the profits which have
hitherto been drawn from the citi
zens of Essex by other banking liouf
es, and which have not been incon/1
derable, may he retained among our
selves, and applied to the promotion
of our own bulinefs. And as the af
fociators are not only jointly, but in
dividually, answerable for the credit
of the Bank, the inhabitants of this
county will find a superior degree
of (ecurity, co-operating with their
general interest, to give a currency
to the Essex Bank Bills.
A particular convenience nrifes to
the inhabitants more immediately in
its neighborhood : that every man
may deposit his cafli in the Bank for
security, free of expense, however
large or finall the (um, and make use
ot checks for the transaction of buli
nefs.
While the good of the community
is promoted by this institution, it is
hoped that the flockholders may de
rive a reasonable advantage for their
enterprize.
BOSTON, June 21.
Capt. Kellfa, from Bilboa, which he left the
beginning of May, confirms the accounts of the
Declaration of War by the French Nation against
the Ho use of Austria, and the other powers who
have succoured and encouraged theFrenchemi
grants, and who have been menacing hostilities,
and dilating terms to France.âHe further
adds, that a merchant of great repute in Bilboa,
read hiin an account of a battle which had been
fought by the French Patriots, and the Germane
in Austrian Flandersâthat it was on the 26tb
day of April, and that accounts had dated the
loss on both fides at yooo mea, the a&ion conti
ting from nine in the morning until four in
afternoon. On which fide Victory declared
iTelf, he did notunderftand, but supposes from
silence on that head, that it was dubious.
The Captain further informs that the Spanish
ernment entertained great fears of a Revo
ion in that kingdomâthat, as far as possible,
' cori *efpondence on political fuhjedls was in
terdicted, and that the Inquisition-Boat visited
every veiTel on its arrival, to forbid the landing
of any books, pamphlets, letters or newfpapevs,
but such as were previously inspected. The
Captain and crew of all vessels were also forbid
speaking on the government orreligion of Spain.
NEW-YORK, June 25.
The Governor of the state of Georgia ha-,
iiTued his proclamation requiring the citizens of
that state resident in the /ower di(tri<st, to elect,
on Â£he 9th of July, one ILeprefentative in the
Congress of the United States, in the room of
Anthony Wayne.
Philadelphia, June 30
European accounts by the packet, and by a
late arrival at Charleston from London, further
informâThat proclamations are stuck up in all
the Itrect ; of Luxemburg!!, purporting that the
Governors Genera! of the Low Countries have
Ix en informed that the Jacobins have formed a
design of fending emiilaries into that country,
undjr the difguile of peasants, to distribute se
ditious pamphlets among the peopleâthey
therefore odfer a reward of 100 ducats to any
one who shall cause any of these emhTaries to be
arrestedâThat the trial of M. Lcilart before
the High Court, had commenced; his firll hear
ing lasted three hours.âThat the- French ports
in the channel were menaced by privateers
who were preparing to put to lea under impe
rial colours the moment war was declared.â
That the Prince de NafTau had arrived at Cob
leiitzâThat the Princes ofHohenloe, Bartfen
ftein, &c. have concluded treaties of subsidy
with the French Princes.âln the late fire at
Gottenburg, 123 houses weredeftroyed, the uni
versity and the lliipping were preserved.âThe
new King of Hungary has dismissed all the re
tainers of the Italian opera, by vhich he saves
300,000 florins per annum; âthat he had lately
received a note containing these words, " If
you value your life, do not meddle with the af
fairs of the French nation."âThat reports are
in circulation at Paris, that the Prince of Brunf
wick was aflaffinated in his closet; that the
Elector of Bavaria is dead; and that the Em
press of Russia was arrested. âThat the cele
brated Captain Pacha, who was Admiral of the
Turkish fleet the late war, is deposed, and suc
ceeded by a page aged 30, who lias never seen
any service at sea ; this appointment has much
displeased the officers of the navy.âThat not
withstanding the discontents which reigned in
Sweden at the conclusion of the Diet of Gefle,
the afl'aflination of the King has contributed
more to reconcile those to the royal authority
who were opposed to it, than to forward the
views of the conspiratorsâos this, the young
King and the regent have received proof by a
deputation from the four orders to allure those
Princes of their loyalty and attachment.âThat
the death of Guftavus has not altered the deter
mination of the Swedilh government to unite
with the confederate lovereignsof Prussia, Aus
tria and Ruflia.âThat the Imperialists are in
full force every where, and their troops in the
fincft conditionâthat they have an army of
16,000 men in the neighbourhood of Brulfels,
and that Oftend is guarded by a chosen body of
troops Notwithstanding the preceding ac
counts, there is the strongest reason to believe
that the confederates against the revolution of
France entertain the greatest apprehensions for
the internal tranquility of their refpe&ive ter
ritoriesâthe French are enthufiaftic,and will be
invincible, for the spirit of liberty, where a
contest can be maintained, will malt afluredly
triumph.
Sailed on Monday last from this port for Eng

Electioneering for feats in the House of Re
presentatives of the United States, under the
law providing for an encreafe in that branch of
the legislature, is begun in Virginia. The Win
chester paper of the 18th inft. contains an ad
dress to ele&ors from Mr. Robert Rutherford,
of Berkley county, an old servant of the public,
on the fubjeft.
Articles in the Britilli papers received by
the Packet, speaking of the conduct of the Eng
lish Ministry at the present crisis, infinuate â
that they have not only changed their system of
a balance,but that they have surrendered all the
ancient and established policy of England, and
because they have been foiled in undertaking
needless armaments, are at length determined
to fuffer no occasion to provoke them to hosti
lity. They have called out Wolf ! Wolf! so
long, with needless terror, or with artful design,
that they are now afraid to announce a real
danger.
The latest accounts from France contain lit
tle more than details of the patriotic spirit
which t'ie declaration of war has brought into
a&ion, and the zeal with which contributions
are made to support it. This is the critical
period to provide those permanent refourcesfor
the support of Liberty and the Constitution,
which may be wanted when the present ardor
ihall abate. Our allies will doubtless profit by
I the experience of this country.
The Salem Gazette of last week contains a
particular account of a disagreeable affair that
occurred in Table Bay, between Capt. Sims,
of the ship Fame, of Philadelphia, and Captain
Bligh, commander of theÃritifh ship Providence.
Capt. Bligh, it seems, took one of Capt. Sims'
men, and notwithstanding the spirited remon
i!:rances of Capt Sims, refufed to deliver him
up.âOn various pretences, it is said that the
Teamen have in a high-handed manner been
lately taken from several American veflels.
We hear that the distilling business is in so

day's post, contains nothing new.
From a Bennington paper of June 15.
We are happy to inform our readers, that the
report published some time since, stating tha'
Judge Powell was sent to Quebec in irons, is
wholly premature; that piece of calumny was;
undoubtedly framed by some of his enemiesâ
for, like all men of merit, he is not without
i them.

The account of the assassination of the Ki:-
of Sweden, as published by authority at Stock
holm, contains the following particulars in brief:
That it appears from the confeflions of the cri
minals themselves, that Ankerftrom and Count
Horn had agreed, that the removal of the King
was the only thing that could effect their wiihel
in a change of the governmentâThat Anker
ftrom fays he was also actuated by a spirit of re
venge on account of a prosecution carried on
against him lalt year, which induccd him to he
the inflrurnent of removing the KingâThat se
veral plans of carrying the design into execution
had been contemplated, but had failedâThat
Count Ribbing entered into the con (piracy;
shortly after which, it was resolved by thcic
three persons, that the King should be afiallinat
ed by Ankerfirom, either with a dagger or pis
tols, at a play or malquerade, where a great
concourse of people would be collc&ed, that the
! aflaffin might be easier concealedâThat these
. three conspirators were at the play on the 16th
January iaftâthat Horn placed Ankerftrom in
a covered paifage, which the King uled to pass
through, where he was to have been shot; but
tlie King did not that evening go into this pas
sage, by which means Ankerftrom's murderous
intention was fruftratedâTwo days after this,
he was at another play, but could not get a fa
vorable opportunityâA masquerade between
the 19th and 20th of January was then fixed on,
but the company being fmal), prevented the ex
ecution of their designâThey then let out for
Gefle, where the murder was to have been per
petrated at a malquerade on the 2d March, but
was again prevented in consequence of the imall
number of persons prefect-âA masquerade was
advertised for the 16th March; this was fixed
on as the time; previous to which, it appears,
that Major Liljehorn and General Pechelin had
been let into the latter of whom
was to provide for the revolution which was to
take place after the alfalUnation.
The whole plan was further matured at Count
Ribbing's country featâwho was to get a num
ber of people to the masquerade, in which-bufi
nefs Pechelin promised to aflift. Horn, Anker
ftrom, and Ribb.ng, met at the lodgings of the
latter 011 Friday evening, where Ankerftrom
loaded his piftolswith balls, lhot and nails; be
lides which he took a large knife, ground lharp
on both fides, and to which a barb was made ;
after which they all three went to the masque
radeâWhen the King, presently after, came in
to the room, Ankerftrom in the croud approach
ed him, took thepiftol from his fide-pocket and
fiiot the King, who flood with his back towards
j him, so near that the mouth of the pistol touch
ed his cloaths. Ankerftrom, who, when the
King did not fall, was about to complete the
murder with the knife, was so agitated, that he
dropped it on the floor, and let the pistols also
gently fall at the fame time ; as he drew him
felf back among the people, to create a general
confufion, he cried out, Fire! which was re
peated by many others.
It appeared that Baron Bjelke was deeply
concernedâthat Lieut. Ehrenfward was also of
the party âthat the Counfcllor of Chancery,
Jacob Von Engeftrom, was acquainted withthe
designâbesides whom, Major Hertfmanfdorf, of
the Artillery, the Secretary of Protocol, John
Von Engeftrom, are accused, and have made
partial confellions.
General Pechelin denies the charges against
him, but Baron Bjelke poifoncd himfelf, and the
court of justice ordered that his body Ihould be
taken by the common hangman to the gallows,
and buried thereâwhich was done.
The Counsel for the prosecution has given in
his final pleading against: Ankerftrom, and the
Royal Coun of Justice is proceeding in the bu
linefs with relpeft to the others.
LxtraEl of a letter from a gentleman in England, to
his friend in this cityâreceived by the Packetâda
ted May 1y?, 1792.
'* Beiore 1 enter upon the special business, that
occasions my writing by the packet ; I mull con
gratulate you upon tlie rising spirit of humanity
and liberty in my native country, which has at
length shewn itfelf in the House of Commons,
where it was carried the last week that the Britifti
African trade in human flefh shall cease Jan. ift,
1796. You will now be furnifhed with continual
news from Europe. The despots having perfifttd
in their plan of attcmpiing to force the French to
submit to their former flavcry, notwithftandmg the
providential warnings given them to the contrary
m the unexpected deaths of the Emperor and the
Swedifti King; the National Alfcinbly and the
King of the French, have wifely declared war
against the King of Hungary, with the design of
giving a home thruftj before the confederates are
!ully provided to parry it off. A stranger to the
language of France, and too far advanced beyond
sixty, I cannot serve them in any shape by crofling
the channel, beyond what I can do here, by open
ly and publicly, as well as privately advocating
their cause, and implorcing the favor of heaven
on them that they may be succeeded, that the
judgment of war may be changed into a blefling
io them, by proving the mean of firmly eftablilh
mg their constitution, and that it may aI so prove
the introdudlion and confirmation of sacred and
civil liberty in its utinoit extent through other Eu
ropean dominions. The present is a new kind of
war ; royal and imperial defpotilm against na
tional liberty. I pretend not to the knowledge
of courufccrets ; but can easily conje&urc, that the
royal undertakers have the hearty fan&ion of all
the crowned heads, the Polifhonly excepted ; and
rhey that have faith in the sincerity of Louis, will
except him alio. Many think that our court are
itrong in favor of the anti-revolutionists ; and
wouid willingly aid them out of the public purse;
but it is my own private opinion, besides that of
numbers, that no minister will dare to do it;
for ii is certain, that a fenle of what ai e the rights
of men spreads ; the many excellent publications,
that Burke's political yealt or barm into
exftence, have greatly diffuled civil knowledge.
Paine, and some oihers go into an cxcefs ; but
they arc of great ufc, and tend to bring off indi
viduals from the other extreme, and nearer to
ihat middle wherein lies the greatest fafety. I
have lived to fee one revolution terminate most
happily, in the best government that exists ; and I
hope to fee the other in Europe end gloriously :
not that either is pet fe&. The French fiiould have
an upper House or Senate, where, the arittocracs
may collect and snare in government. There will
always, in a large commercial community, be
pcrfons, whole superior abilities and fortunes will
taife them above the generality, and who will of
courlc entertain aristocratic fenumeuts ; and I ap
piehend that it is much fdfer tor the body politic,
that these should form a fcparatebranch, than mix
with the common mass in one leprefentative as
sembly, whereby joint and covert policy they
secure a majority to lupport their own
though invitible plans. Your American Conftnu
lion has provicid th.it no title of vobihty Jha.lL U

(which arc' rcaily titles Â»Â»f nobility) fha,; be he

another. You will perceive that 1 have my c
to the Cincinnati, frÂ»r tiie individuals of which I
have the gieatcfl veneration and eltccm, and lec
them tnjoy the honorable order while they exiti;
but then let it cease with them : but if their tons,
and sons-ions arc to inherit it alter them, they
have a privilege annexed to them, that exalts them
above their fellow-citizens, which is 3Ctual no
bility. Hereditary honors 01 offices, I aDhoi (as
being repugnant to common fenlY) with one ex
ceptionâhonors and offices arc bellovtfed as the
reward ot merit, and should therefore be confined
to merit ; but merit is not hereditary. The patri
otic and courageous soldier, may be fuccetded by
a cowardly felfifh foo. The firmeft friend ot li
berty may leave behind him a man of the mod
unpriciplcd and despotic call. The pious and
good magiflrate and minillcr, may be the lathers ot*
profligate and vile wretches. I have made a sin
gle exception, in favor of a peculiar hereditary
iuccelfion, being appiehenfive that the firfl magil
t'ate, whether filled King, Emperor, or Prelident,
should be hereditary to prevent the horrid con
lefts that mufi be the attendants of renewed elec
tions.âTo avoid which for the future, the Poles
have in their new conflitution provided for an he
leditary foveteignty."
Ext raÂ£l of a letter from a gentleman <Â« Lexington %
Krvtucke y, to his correj ft undent in Carlijle, dated
May 21/?, 1792.
" The Indians have been doing a considera
ble damage about Frankl"ortâThey were pur
sued over the Ohio by a party of Volunteer:,
but they found the Indians too strong to at
tempt an attack, and returned without doing
any thing."
Ex trad of another letter from the fume place.
u Our Convention did in one week make a
Constitution ; the next week that Constitution
was unanimously adopted ; and now our Repre

Bullet, Pay ton Short; the wheels of that con
stitution will on the 4th of June be put in mo

Ignorance is said to be the effect of tyranny,
but it may be doubted whether an enlightened
people were ever enslaved except by the appli
cation of superior external force.
I Certain it is, that freedom and ignorance
cannot long exist together; for mankind will
not naturally prize those things, the advantages
of which require an enlightened understanding
justly to appreciate.
u Oppreifion will make men mad"âand re
sistance to tyranny is an impulle of nature, whe
therenlightened or not; but, the blcffir.gs of
revolutions depend on a wife improvement of
that change in society which they produceâfor
the want of due information, and just principles
how many enterprizes in favor of the rights of
man have proved abortive ?
Friends of the human race ! would you lay
