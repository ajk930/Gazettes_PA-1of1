SATURDAY, January 5.
CO N TINUATION OF THE
DEBATE on MR. STEELE'S MOTIOJf,
â¢ For reducing tl'e Army.
MR. MOORE said, the resolution as now
worded, contemplates the reduction of
the army to two regiments. No rc=?b.-jS.
been intioduced for thismeafure, which were
cot brought forward in the firft difcuflion of
tto fubjeft. He thought that t.'.e rc ifons for
continuing the army, existed with additional
force. He observed, that granting abuses had
taken place, it was no good reason for repeal
ing a law. If abnfes do exist, which he by no
means thought to be fact, this was not the
way to correct those abuses. But he insisted,
that the mode proposed as a fubftituttf for car
rying on the war, was the way to encreafe
those abusesâthe opportunities would be en
creafedâand the meansgreatly diminiflied, by
reason of the distance, of detesting & prevent
ing them. He enlarged on this idea; and then
entered into a consideration of the queftibn,
whether the militia or the regular troops
were the most eligible to be employed in an
Indian war?âtie stated the difficulties and
expcnces arising from the militia systemâit
would be much greater than it has ever yet
been. Adverting to the fyfter.i adopted by
Congrcfs, he observed that two ebjefts ap
peared to have been in view at that timeâ
those objects exist at the prefeÃt moment;
they have reference to two species of forceâ
a defenfive, and an incurfive. He said if no
other thaw a militia was contemplated, -the
Indians would never make a permanent
peace. The iticurfions of the militia, and the
burning of their town's, will uever bring the
Indians to termsâpermament pods must be
eftablilhed ; a reipeclablc force must be fixed
In their neighborhood. He alluded to the
treaties which had already been madeâthe
repeated violations of those treaties. Fear
only can keep the savages within any bounds.
Nothing el re can effeit a lasting peace. A
permanent regular force is then the necefTary
resultâthe experience of the French, Spani
ards and English, fufficiently enforce the pro
priety and necessity of regular troops. Here
ho entered into a consideration of the differ
ence between such regular troops as he con
templated, and those to which gentlemen ap
peared to be opposed. Added to the advan
tages of difcipiine, the regular troops may be
trained to fight the Indians in their own way,
to greater purpose than any militia ever can.
On the whole, he was clearly of opinion that
the present was not the time to reduce the
military force of the countryâand (hould
therefore vote the motion.
Mr. AVilliamfbn so far supported the mo
tion, as to suggest the reducing the number
of officers on the regular eftabliihment, to the
number of men in actual service, and to stop
recruiting after the month of March.
Mr. Mad i Ton said the present discussion in
volved a revival of the tjueftion agitated the
)aft session, whether the militia or regular
troops were to be preferred in carrying on the
Indian war?âlt is said that this is not the
time to reduce the military force of the coun
tryâthat the President is invested with the
power of reducing the armyâthat while im
portant negotiations are pending, it will be
attended with inauspicious effects to leflen
the imprejfions of our power on the mind of
the Indians. These considerations, he ac
knowledged to be weightyâbut if the force
of the country can be continued on as rc
fpeftable a footing as alt present, and at the
lame time the expence greatly diminiftied,
the government would be inexcusable not to
do it. It is supposed that this may be done
in perfect consistency with impressing the ene
my with the failed imprellion of our power.
He suggested therefore the eligibility of com
peting the effe&ive force by the addition of
volunteer militiaâto organize compleatly the
regular troops already raisedâand to reftrilt
them to the number that they at present con
sist of. To reduce this idea to effect, he sug
gested to the gentleman from North-Carolina
a modification of his motion, by an amend
ment in conformity to these ideas.
Mr. Steele said he was perfectly in senti
ment with the gentleman, in regard to the
propriety of inferring an amendment to the
motion, which might fecureafufficient appro
priation to carry on ofL'nfive operations a
giinft the hostile Indians, by the militia of the
frontiers ; and if an alteration was proposed
tÂ« that effect, he would fecoud it. "The at

tention of the K011R: to this question speak?
its importance ; it is probable, one move im
portant will not occur during the present ses
sion. On its decision are suspended the hopes
and fears of the people of this country, their
hopes of a speedy and honorable peace, and
their fears of 3 standing army, with its ui'ual
retinue of political evils.
The present is regarded as *n interesting
epoch in the affairs of the United States; and
it has been perceived, with serious regret,
that while our national character is forming
{he hoped it was not yet formed) it seems to
partake in some ref|>efts more of the unnatn
ral spirit of monarchy, than of the mild and
conciliatory temper of a republic. The prin
ciple of keeping up standing armies, though
highly obnoxious to the great body oi the peo-
P le i iias not been equally so to the govern
ment ; they have been maintained and eil
creafed without affording prote&ion, or even
defence- to-th* fumrtcrs i the fuppiies necef
cÂ» support the eftabliftmient, begins to
discover an alarming derangement of the pub
lic finances, and it is now incumhent on' the
House cf l'ieyrefentatives to check this grow
ing mifchief.
Mr. Steele then adverted to the effects of
{landing armies on the morals and political
fentimeats of the people, wherever thev had
been employed; of the expenfivenefs of all
such establishments, and of the wicked purpos
es to which they had been, and might be sub-
fcrvicnt. He laid, he had prepared himfelf to
have spoken largely to this pcint, and to have
quoted the pernicious effects of fucli a policy
in other options ; but the debate having been
already lengthy, and the committee probably
fatigued, it would be fufficient for his present
purpose for the members to make their own
reflections, and to mark the rapid progrelTion
of the army from 1789 to 179 3 Â» bo'h i" num
bers and expcnces. Instances from foreign
history are fuperfluous, when our own affords
such ample testimony. The eftabliihment be
gan with one regiment, it is now five ; the
Hotife was called on in 1789 to appropriate a
little more than 100,00 a dollars for mat de
partmeut, in the pre Lent year above one mil
lion is demanded. The reason of this extra
ordinary additional expenditure, -tbss urss
pefted encreafe of the army, if not enveloped
in darkness, has been founded on policy hi
therto not fatisfaftorily explained. He said,
however lightly he was disposed to touch this
part of the fubjeft, he could not avoid re
minding the committee of the memorable sen
timents of 1776, in regard to standing armies;
of the universal abhorrence of the Americans
to them at that time; and to illustrate it
more clearly, he read the expreflions of some
of the states in their Bills of Rights. These
were the sentiments of the whigs of 1776, and
to ftich whigs he wished to appeal on thistoc
cafion.
He also reminded the committee of the re
cent debates of 1788, of the amendments pro
posed in several state conventions, of the una
nimity which prevailed among all ranks of
people on this particular point; and it is now
to be lamented, said he, that while the ink
which recorded these objections to the consti
tution is yet drying, the evil then predicted
has taken place.
If there is a subject on which much delibe
ration is unneceflary, in order to forming a
right opinion, it would be in regard to mili
tary eftabli(hments; the feelings of a free
people revolt at their continuance; and every
man who reads, or can point out their
dangers.
He said, he felt more anxiety for the fate
of this motion, than commonly markshis con
duit, because this isthelaft lei Eon that will
fever afford him an opportunity to trouble the
House with his sentiments on this, or any o
ther fubjetfl. The motion was brought for
ward to dil'charge a duty which he owed to
his constituents, to fatisfy his own confer
ence, and to afford that protection to the fron
tiers which they deserved, and to save the
public money. If an uncommon degree of
zeal was discovered in supporting the motion,
it ought to be attributed to thefe,and no other
motives.
The question will now soon be takenâif
adopted, I (hall be among those who rejoice ;
if rejected, among those who have always Â£Ã¼b
mittud with a proper degree of decency to the
decision of the majority. But in any event,
the public will know that we have aflerted
the sense oftjie people against ftandingjarmies,
that we are anxious to defend the frontiers
against their enemies, that we have recom
mended a system of occonomy and efficiency,
instead of profufion and delay, that we have
recommended a system calculated to produce
victory and peace, instead of disgrace anc}
war, and that we wilh to rescue the govern
ment from the intoxication of the times, and
all the apery of military establishments.
He said, he had been attentive to the argu.
mentt of the opposition, and they tend prin
cipally to four points. If neither of these po
sitions be found tenable, the motion will cer
tainly fuccecd ; and that they are not tenable,
is believed and wili be ihewn.
261
Ift. It has been boldly asserted that the
President is the author of the existing system.
2dly. Tbey call in question the sincerity of
our declarations in wishing to afford effe&ual
protection to the frontiers.
3dly. They deny the competency of the
militia.
4thly. The impolicy of reducing the efta.
biilhment, when a treaty is expected.
In regard to the firft, we deny that the Pre
sident is the author of this plan of prosecuting
the war, not having avowed explicitly himfelf
that he is so, & no document appearing to con
firm that opinion, we are juftifiedin attribut
ing a system which appears to us ineffectual,
to his Secretary and not to him.
It is true that the Secretary is only a fin
ger of his hand, and the intimate connexion
which must of necessity subsist between theto,
perhaps is the ground upon which the aflerti
r/n has been made. The Secretaries are all
equally near to the President, and if it be ad
mitted that he is the author of this, he may
with equal propriety, be said to have beer,
.the author of every fyftemon general ftibjefts
which either of them have recommended.
Was he the author of the report on the fifli
eries ? Was be the author of the plan for ef
tablilhingthe National Bank: It is-known
that he was itot, and circumstances might be
mentioned (which are withheld from delicacy)
to confirm this opinion.
Was he the author of the funding f} Item ?
Some gentlemen in the apportion to thli mo
tion, would not be willing to. give the Presi
dent that credit if he claimed it ; and some
who support this motion, would not only be
sorry that the President Had even claimed such
a credit, but believe that it was in no respect
attributable to him. The fame gentleman
(Mr. Wadfworth) who firft afierted that the
President was the author of this military plan,
in the fame speech admitted it to be the war,
as well as the plan of the lionTe, and then ar
gued on the necessity of liability in our mea
sures. It is eat very material to the prelent
question whose plaji in is; being a pubiic mea
sure, we are juftified in offering our objections
to it ; and tins is the firft time that I have
heard it publickly alferted that a government
.VmM jx'rfevere ia jn etror, hifffaufr* thÂ« Vhad
undertaken it. If the plan be a good one, it
may be l'upported by reason ; if a bad one, no
name ought to be called ii) to prop it up.
The inconsistency of that gentleman's (Mr.
Wadfworth) arguments not only supports the
motion before the committee, but shews the
wretched fhifts which have been used to de
feat it.
It has been Paid in the course of the debate,
that individual members, and even this lioufe,
are incompetent to decide upon the efficacy
or inefficacy of military plans. In answer to
this it may be said, that if we are not all Ge
nerals, we are all members, and that we have
the privilege of thinking for ourselves and for
our constituents. To admit this doftrir.e in
the latitude which has been expressed, would
be tÂ» introduce military ideas indeed; it would
be to makÂ» soldiers of tis, instead of legisla
tors; nay worse than that, it would be to re
vive the exploded doctrines of pafiive obedi
ence and non-resistance.
In regard to the sincerity of his intentions
to afford effectual protection to the frontiers,
Mr. Steele said that he had been Efficiently
explicit, that a feeling for the fufferers had
dictated this motion ; that he was sorry it had
been whiipered in the ears of some of the
n'embers, that it was intended to withhold
the necessary appropriations, and divert them
to other purposes.
If two regiments were inefficient to gar
rison all the posts necessary for defence, he
would even under certain reftriflions, cfth
fent to continue the three sub-legions, there
by enabling the President to eftablifli double
the number of posts now erected if he should
deem it adviieable. Regular troops being in
capable of a&ive expeditions against Indians
in the wilderness, his wilh was to abandon
that system, and confine them entirely to the
garrison.
The next obje&ion to the motion is the in
competency of the militia, and to support this
opinion the gentleman from Conne&icut (Mr.
Wadfworth) has made this expreflion, " that as
to the expedition under General St. Clair, the
regulars were tew, and not to be named when
Compared with the number of the militia." The
truth is there was not a man engaged that day
as a militia man, except the advance guard com
manded by Col. Oldham, which Confided of
300, perhaps a few more, the field return of the
day preceding the action being in the war-office,
this can be ascertained with precision. The
ballanceof the army on that unfortunate day,
had been entitled as regulars, even cloathed as
regulars, wrre fought as regulars, and poor fel
lows, died like regulars. They fuffered the fate
which awaits every regular army destined for si
milar expeditions. Even the handful of militia
employed that day, did not deserve that name,
they were chiefly fubftituies for draughted men
from theceded territory. This draught bccame
unavoidable, from a misfortune to General Se
vier, which Mr. Steele related.
The attack on Major Adaii has also been men
tioned at a proof of the incompetency of mili-
[Whole No. 588.]
tia and Mr. Steele infilled, that the only infer
ence which could be drtwft from thence was,
that 100 militia were able to repel, but not del
ftroy near 200 Indians.âThis event he conceiv
ed was in favor, and not against his motion.
He next adverted to the argument of Mr.
Wadfworth, in regard to the war of 1,76* ; of
the eftabhfhmeni of poftj in PenDfylvania 'and
Virginia,and of the fucctfs of Colonel Bouqu t's
expedition. If two worn-out rcgimentsat that
time were fufficient to defend the frontiers, and
with the aid of the militia, to terminate the
â war, two new tegiments,in them, all the vigour
which the gentleman described to now poflefj,
with the aid of eflablilhed posts, and a much
more effective militia, can certainly be equal to
the fame end Al'er examining Mr. W.'s
arguments for some time, Mr. Steele said, that
when analyzed, it would be found, that they
proved more than they were intended to prove f
but the merits of this motion did not require
that he (hould take advantige of these indirec
tions.
He (hewed from the hi ft or? of 1762, that tho*
potts wttt eftahlilhed, with a handful of regu
lar troops in each, they never answered the pur
pose of efi"Â«Â£lual proteftinn ; but t,he frontier
people Were always obliged, in a great degree,
to defend themselves j that thev were best cal
culated for that service, and that they would
perform it now with alacri'y and Cucccfs, if
well rewarded.
Mr '. ?'f cle t ' lfn refuted the objection against
the itiilitia on account 6f their waste and ex
pence which Mr. W. had alluded to. The law
allows a mounted volunteer, furnifhing himfelf
with a good horse, good arms, piovifions, and
every other nereflarv, except ammunitinu, at hts
own risque and cxpcr.ce, one dollar per day.
The ciÂ£)ft ex pence of such an expedition, can be
calculated. Whether (uccefsful or not, the
charge to the public cannot be mcreafed. The
contractors, quarter-matter's and hospital de
partments are a'l avoided, with the abufes.ex
pencer and frauds attending such eltablilhments.
Mr. Steele enlarged upon this point, and faiii
that these are always found to be the most expci .
five departments in any armv, and that the fe
deral treafuiy had fell their effects already. In
favor ol the militia it mav h<- aflted, who fought
the battle of Bunker's Hill ? Who fought the
battle of New.Jersey f Who have fought (he
Indians so often with success, under GcneraU
Wirktnton, Str7it, Â»ct ontl âuifijri s T âWtto
marched in 1776 under General Rutherford,
through the Cherokee nation, laid waste their
country, and forced them to peace ? Who (ought
the battles of Georgia, under Clark and Twiggs ?
Who fought the battles of South-Carolina, un
der the command of an honorable member, now
preGnt ? Delicacy forbids to enlarge upon his
fuccefles in his pre fence.
Who fought the ever memorable battles of
Cowpens, King's Mountain, Hanging Rock,
Blackftocks ; the ?i\ots, on which the revolu
tion turned in the southern States ? In (bort,
who fought all the battles of the southern States,
while we had a mere handful of regular troops,
scarcely the (hadow, much less the reality of an
army ?
They were all fought by freemen, the substan
tial freeholders of the country : men attached to
the revolution from priuciple : men who wero
sensible of their tights, and fought for them.
Such men will not enlist in regular armies, nor
will any one who has the disposition, or the con
ftitutton of a frteman. It would give me pain
to describe the trash which compose* all regular
armies: They enlist for three dollars a month ;
which, in p country like the Unttc-d States, is a
fufticicnt description of their bodies as well as
their minds. Such men are not fit to combat
the moll aÂ£live enemy in the world. Here Mr.
Steele read Major Gaither's and Major True*
man\s depositions, refpe&ing the defeat of lhÂ«
Â±th November, 1791, dating, that they could
not fee the Indians, because they were behind
trees, &cc, that the regular troops tried, but
could not fight that way ; that tb?y ffemed t*
be stupid, and incapable of refinance ; 2nd that
if any General in the wprld had commanded
such men that day, he muil have been defeated
as they were.
An additional areument, and one of the most
weighty too, against regular expeditions, in this
fpectesof warfare, is that by the slowness of
their movements, the force of the enemy may
be concentrated, âtime is afforded them to form
alliances, and to confederate against those whom
they consider a common enemy. Tt is other
wise with militia incursions. He offered a num-*
ber of reasons to (hew that it was so, and how
e(Tent?al for the interest of the United States, to
adopt a policy calculated to detach the tribes
from each other as mucb as pollibte.
But it h?Â« beeu said the(e men were not regu
lar .troops. Mr. Steele aflced, what theo were
they ? They surely were not militia.
The last objc&ion, and the Icaft serious of all,
to this motion, is che expectations of a treaty in
the spring. Mr. Steele laid, if he thought
gentleman who threw this difficulty in the way,
believed himfelf that we have any reason to ex*
pe6i a permanent peace from the treaty now pro
posed, it may deferye an anlwei, Fasts arc
more to be relied upon than words: from the
channel through which these proportions have
comeâfrom the whole complexion of their
talks, and from the late attack on Major Adair,
it may fafely be alferted, that no peace can be
effr&ed in the spring.
lie recapitulated fomeof the difficulties which
this motion had to conflict, aod fajd, that becould mention other*, if he was at liberty to do
to. Under such circumftancej, success iÂ» hardly
to be expefled ; âbut he knew that the merits
ofthfcqjoiion deserved it.
He Could not fetdown, without making one
remark upon the calculation! and statement ot
expenccs in the war deparimcnt, offered to the
Committee by Mr. Wadfwoith last Wedneldav {
aud though the gentleman then spoke unguard
edly of mv calculations, I feel too much deli
cacy to retort. I ftatid at the commencement
of this debate, that in 1792 there was appropri
ated by law for the Quarter-Master's Depart
ment, 50,000 dollars ;
Mr. Wadfworth ftatesto have
been iftthat year appropri
ated by law,
Difference* 7Â«,00Q
I have re-examined my statement, compared
it with the law, find it was correct ; and there
is no document in poffclllon of the House to
prove, either that his statement is.so, or that
mine is not so.
Indeed, the inaccuracy of his statement if ex
plained and proved by this {ingle circumstance :
In 1792 the law appropriated 50,000 for that de
partment, on ancftimateof 2128 noo-commif
fioned officers and privates, and in 1793* which
is the mod extravagant estimate wc hÂ«ive ever
had, the Secretary at war only demands for the .
Quarter-Master's Department, on an establish- ,
rnent of 5x20 nop-comm; {Honed officers and
privates, the sum ol 100,000 dollars. JsiMea
fonable tofuppofe, that an army of 2000 men,
would require more (lores, than an army- of
5000 ? Or hns it been customary for that officer
to leflen the demands, as the establishment en
creafed ? Tha appropriaiion laws, and the Trea
sury of the United States, can answer this ques
tion. The gentleman's llatement is inaccurate
in moreinftances than thisâbut one is enough
for my purpose. Having made this appear,
Mr. Steefre said he would not speak .again, noi
would he hold himfelf bound to reply to any
observations that might be .made, either in re
gard to his motion or his calculations.
Mr. Hillhouf<* obterved, that nothing had been
advanced in the whole course of this de
bate, but what he had heard mentioned last
winter in the house. He was then opposed iri
principle to a war establishment and he still re
tained the fame opinion ; but from the present
complexion of affairs, it appeared to him, that
be ought to submit, and give up his own opinion
to the general feiife of the legiflaturc, which at
present seemed to be, for persevering in the fyf
tcmalready adopted,and which, as it had scarce
ly had time for a fair tri?l r he thought, ought not
to be arrested, perhaps in the very instant when
its efficacy was to be expe&ed. ,If peace ftiou-ld
not be'cftabliffied.during next ,fiimmer, he
would then join with such as would
propole a better systemâbut as the la w provides
for exercising the discretionary powers of the
executive, it would" be be# to rely 011 .themâ
a standing aimv lie said was a thing impoflible
to be established in thÂ£ United States whilst -
the House of Representatives have the power of
granting money on'y for two years at any time ;
he therefore had no fears on that score. An ar
my existing in time of peace, was the idea he
had of a (landing army i anxLnoL Â»'my em
bodied tor only a year or two : upon the whole,
it would be as expensive to disband the present
force, and institute another of militia, See. as.it
will be to keep up the existing e.ftabHfhment r for
a little longer time ; it was therefore his advice,
to let the matter reft where it was, with-the ex
ecutive for the present. Butincale ; of a peace
not being acconiplifhed within a reasonable pe
riod, he would join those who would be for a
change in the system ; and he was, clearly of
opinion, that a system rnVght cafily be adopted,
not only to protett our frontiers by repelling the
Savages, but to exterminate them altogether.
(Debate to be continued.)
Saturday, January 12,
Mr. Benfon presented a petition from Robert
Eden, a Yorkshire (England) farmer, stating
that he has emigrated to the United States, and
brought with him to New-York, a stock of hor
ses and cattle of the.firft quality; for which he
was charged 7fper cent, import, and for which
he has been obliged to give fecunty. Tne prayer
of the petition is for an exemption of duty,
and to extend a similar benefit to such of his
countrymen as may emigrate to the United
States; many of whom, he intimates, are inclin
ed to come hither, and to import part of their
moll valuable stock. Ordered, that Mr. Eden's
petition be referred to a feleft Committee, Mess.
Benfon, Madilon, and Sedgwick.
Two petitions from the files of the !aft house
were referred to fele& committees, viz. of Abra
ham Kimberly, and of Francis Keller 5 each
praying a grant of land on the river Ohio.
The Secretary of theTreafury's report on the
petition of Griffith Jones, was referred to a fe
le& committee.
The petitions of Ludwig Kuhn, and Ebenezef
Foster, were referred to the Treasury Depart
ment.
The House took into consideration the fubje<a
of the resolutions for loaning the balances which
may appear to be due from the United States to
the individual States. On this a lengthy debate
took place.
The resolutions were finally amended to read
thusâ
Resolved, That a loan to the amount of the
balance which (upon a final settlement of ac
counts) (hull be found due from the United States
to the individual States, be opened at the Loan
Offices in the rcfpeftive States, to commence
within months after the said balances
(hall be reported at the Treasury, and to contin
ue open for the term of months from
the time of its commencement: Provided that
no such loan fliall be opengd in any State wlth
eut the afient of the Legislature thereof, by an
a6l approving of the meaf'ure.
Resolved, That the sums to be subscribed to
such loans, be payable in the principal or inter
est of the certificates or notes issued by any such
of the said States, as (upon the final settlement
of accounts) (hall have a balance due to them
from the United States, and which (hall have
been liquidated to specie value, prior to the
day of lad.
Resolved, That every fubfiriber to the said
loan, (hall be entitled to certificates, according
to the sum subscribed, of the like tenor uid de
fcriptiotis, in the like proportions, and upon the
ike terms, as are fpecified and directed by the
fifteenth and finteenth fe&ions of ad the aintitu
led, " An ast making provision for the debt of
the United States," except, that interest on such
of the certificates, subscribed to the said loan,
as bear interest, shall be computed to the last
day of the year one thousand seven hundred end
ninety-three, indufively, and that interest shall
not begin to accrue upon any of the certificates
which (hall be iCTued in lieu thereof'till the firft
120,000
day of January, one thousand seven hundred
ninety-four. ,
Refolded, That in all cases, wher* the sum
subscribed in the evidence of the debt of any
State, (hall exceed the balance due to such State,
the famelhall be reduced (in equal proportions)
to the sum a dually duÂ« to such State.
' The resolutions as thus amended, being adopt
ed by the House, a committee confuting of the
following members, viz. Meflrs. Fitzfimons,
Sedgwick, and Smith, S. C. was appointed to
report a bill. Adjourned.
MONDAY, JANUARY 14.
A report was read on the petition of Elijah
Boftwick, which was in favour of the peti
tioner.
Mr. Lawrance presented the petition of the
officers of the Delaware line of the late continen
tal army. Read and referred to the committee
of the whole.
Mr. Parker prfcfented the petition of Thomas
Wifliart, a ferjeant in the Virginia line of the
late array. Read and referred to the Secretary
of War.
The bill for fettling the claims ofperfons not
barred by any ad of limitation, and which have
hot been heretofore adjusted, was ordered to b"c
engrossed for a third reading.
The House proceeded in the discussion of the
bill to regulate trade and intercourse with the
Indian tribes. Several amendments were pro
posed and difcufied. Some of these were agreed
to, and then, by general consent, the bill was
laid on the table till to-morrow.
Mr. Hartley laid the following motion on the
table, That a committee be appointed to pre
pare and report a bill to make provision of half
pay for the widows and orphans of such officers
of the army of the United States who may have
been killed since the third day of June, 1784,
or who may be hereafter killed in the service of
the United States.
A meflage was received from the President
of the U. S. by Mr. Lear, his Secretary, inform â¢
ing the Hotife that ne has approved and signed
two ads which originated in the House, viz.
an ad to amend the ad for establishing a mint,
and to regulate the coins of the United States, so
far as refpedi the coinage of copperâand an ad
for granting interest on a claim allowed by a re
solution of the late Congress, as an indemnifica
tion to the pcrftms therein mentioned.
Mr. Boudinot moved for. the order of the day,
on the Bankrupt LawâThe importance of this
fubje<st to the general interest, and that of
a number of individuals in several of. the dates,
who, by reafori of the state governments being
precluded from pafling bankrupt laws, are in a
very diftrefled situation, was urged by several of;
the members. It was further observed, that it
had long been before Congress, and if it was not
taken up at the present feflion, it was very pro
blematical whether it would be completed at the
next feflion.
In opposition to the motion it was observed,
that though the business has been a long time
on the carpet, yet it had not been reduced to any
fpecific fqrm till very latelyâthat the bill had
been laid before the public for the express pur
pose of collecting..the general sense of the peo
p e on the fubjedlâfufficient time has not elaps
ed for this purpose, and therefore it was not pof-'
fible for the legillature to proceed in the busi
ness, aidtfd by the general sense of their consti
tuents relative thereto.
The. motion was at length withdrawn, and,
on motion of Mr. Gerry, the House refblved it-'
felf into a committee of the whole
in the chair) and took into confederation tfre me
morials of the officers of the several lines of the
late army, on the fubjedt of a deficiency of their
P a y* The several memorials were, from the N.
Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsyl
vania, Delaware and Maryland lines. The New
Hampshire and Pennsylvania Memorials being
read,
Mr. Gerry said, in order to bring the fubje&
before the committee, he should move the fol
lowing resolution, viz. Resolved, as the opinion
of this committee,* that the contra# between
Congress and a part of the officers and soldiers
of the armies raised for the establishment of the
Independence of the United States, has not been
fulfilled on the part of Congress.
This motion, was seconded by Mr. Parker.
Mr. Gerry accompanied his motion by several
observations,in which he shewed that a deprecia
ted medium could never be confideredasan equi
valent for services and supplies which were con
tracted to be paid for in specie.
Several members objededto the indefinitenefs
th s is L refo,Ution * They suggested the proprie
ty of the mover's bringing forward a sketch of
the plan for which he intended the resolution as
a basis.
Mr. Midi fen suggested a variation of the
proposition to the simple quellion on the pro
priety of granting the prayer of the petitions.
After several observations from other mem
bers, and the Chairman had remarked that the
resolution of Mr. Gerry was not in order, as
refering to a part of the officers, whereas the
memorials made no diftin&ion.
Mr. Clark moved, in order to take the sense
of the cemmittee, the following, Refofved, as
the opinion of this committee, that the prayer of
the petitions of officers of several lines of the
262
late American army, cannot be granted, and tliat
the petitioners have leave to withdraw their pe
titions.
This motion occasioned a debate. Mr. Ma
dison, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Mercer, sustained
the general prayer of the petitions. Mr. Clark
opposed it. Some gentlemen opposed the_torm
of the motion, as tending to cramp the difcufli
on of the business. It wasfuggefted to the mo
ver, the eligibility of suspending it.
After some further remarks, Mr. Clark mo
ved that the committee ftiould rife. The com
mittee accordingly rose, and had leave to fit
again. Adjourned.
Â» TUESDAY, Jan.-U-
An engrnffed bill, relative to
claims against the United States,not
barred by any atfi of limitation,and
which have not heretofore been ad
justed, was read the third time and
parted.
Mr, Fitzfimons reported a bill to
authorise a loan, payable in the cer
tificates or notes of such states, as
shall have balanc* due to tbem on
a final settlement of accounts with
the United Statesâread twice, and
committed for Monday next.
A report in favor of William Sey
mour was read,and laid on the table.
Mr. Greenup called up his motion
for a committee to report a bill, for
placing on the pension lift ftich offi
cers and soldiers of the militia as
have becrifjuMna/ bo wowuded or
difabledin the service of the United
States, and who are not provided
for by lawâthis motion was refer
red to a committee of the whole
House, for Thursday next.
The bill to regulate trade and in
tercourse with the Indian tribes,was
again taken into'confideration âMr.
Madison read an amendment, which
he proposed as a substitute for the
Bth feJiion,which refers to purchas
es of lands from the Indiansâthis,
with a proviso to another fe<Sion,
moved by Mr. Greenup, w as laid on
the table.
Mr. Smith called ujj the memorial
of sundry merchants of South-Caro
lina, stating the lofles they sustain
ed by the depreciation of paper mo
ney, and the peculiar hard(hips they
arc exposed to in consequence there
of, by the 4th article of the treaty
of peace with Great-Britainâand
praying relief in the premises.â
This memorial being read, Mr.
Smith moved that it should be refer
red to the committee of the whole
on the petitions of the officers of
the late army.âThis motion occa
sioned a debate ; those who opposed
it, contended that it was a distinct
and different cafe from that of the
officersâthat it involved a very dif
ferent investigation and could not
therefore be connected with itâit
appeared to be designed to embar
rass and perplex the application of
the officers.
In support of the motion, a varie
ty of reasons were adduced to shew
that the cases were parallelâand
that there was no propriety in mak
ing a diftindlion between different
clafles of citizens in their applica
tions for relief in similar cales.â
After considerable debate, it was
moved that the ayes and noes (hould
be called on the motion : This mo
tion was arretted by the previous
question being moved, in the follow
ing wordsâ-' Shall the main ques
tion be now put ?'âthis was deter,
mined in the affirmative, yeas 30,
nays 24. The main question for the
jeference was then put, and nega
tivedâayes 24, noes 30.
The hotife then went into a com
mittee of the whole on the petitions
of the Officers.
Mr. Dayton in the chair.
Mr. Clark withdrew his motion
for a rejection of the prayer of the
petitions, laid on the table jefter
dayâMr. Gerry then offered ano
ther proposition in lieu of the reso
lution he moved yesterday, which
is to the following purport â
That provision ought to be made
for the petitioners to the amount of
the ditference between the value in
the market,of funded and unfunded

by Mr. Clark to incorporate in the
proposition these wordsâall such ci

HAGUE, Ottober 23.
The Austrian Generals have had the pru
dence to take care of their troops, who were
never fuffered to be in want of any thing,
whilst the Pruflians experienced the utmost
want, both for themselves and their horses.
This appears to have been the principal cause
of thafccoolnefs which has taken place between
the commanders of the allied armies. !n
vain did the Pruflians implore assistance from
their allies ; the latter Fent a deaf ear to their
entreaties, and extricated themselves from
that mire in which the others perished. Of
80,000 men whom the King of Prufliafnrnidl
ed, not more than men will return to
that country. His cavalry are quite ruined.
This is an absolute fact, which may be relied
upon.

Duel.âA duel was fought yesterday, in the
neighbourhood of London, which has been ex

publicly known, on Wednesday; would take
place on the eniuing Morning#
The parties were JVL Charles Lametfl and
a friend of the ci-devant Duke de Brie ; the
latter of whom was attended by the Duke de
P.enne. From the inveteracy of their quar
rel it was feared that neither could leave the
field alive; and as they fought with fw'ords,
this miserable probability was much mcreafed.
The event, however 1 , was, th.tt 11. Charles
Laineth fell by a wound through the body,
which, it is hoped, will not be mortal.
M. Laraeth, a member of the late Confti

A gentleman in this city has fa
vored us with the followir.g article
of intelligence, which he received
by the last post from very high au
thority, the truth of which may be
relied upon :
" Dumourier, in the late a&ion
near Mons, had 80,000 men. The
Auftrians had only 18,000. The
French loft more than 10,000 in the
atftion, and the Auftrians retreated
in great order and regularity. The
last advices from the Rhine (late,
that Cuftine's army was on the point
of being intercepted and cut off,
from having advanced with so much
rapidity in the German territories."
Duchess of Biron.âThis accom
plished and charming woman, who
inherited from various relatives the
largest property in France, and
whose escape was almost miraculous
from a furious banditti who menac
ed her life, is again returned to her
native country. The various inci
dents of her life would make an in
teresting volume. If (he be asked
why she returns, in defiance of the
various perils (be mult unavoidably
encounter, we are sorry ro relate,
that (he was entirely destitute in
this country both of money and
clothes ; (he now flies to her aged
mother for comfort and fuflenance.
She has lived in separation from
the General, her hulband, without
the imputation of a fault, from the
firft month of their marriage.
The controversy between the al
lied powets & the people of France,
is (till the leading topic of political
disquisition. The events which
have occurred in the course of the
contest, awaken the curiosity, com
mand the attention, and suspend
the judgment of the public. The
excelles committed by one party
have checked the admiration of
their warmest supporters ; princi
ples avowed by the other must rouse
the resentment of their firmed ad
herents. Though the treachery of
their court, the perfidy of their
minifteis, and the threats of their
enemies, may palliate the enormi
ties of our Gallic neighbours, yet
indiscriminate vengeance cannot be
juftified by partial inifcondudt, nor
the freedom.of a nation founded on
the cruelty ofiudividuals. Nor can
the desire of reitoriug a throne to
its pristine grandeur and a nobility
to their ancient privileges, excuse
an attack upon an independent
(late, and the fubverlion of a con
stitution received by a whole peo
ple. It must be our present lot to
deplore the ravages of boundless li
centiousness and relentless despot
ism. Our opinions must be formed
upon the accidents of the fleeting
hour ; and the slightest circumstan
ces may overturn the thepries which
delighted our imaginations.
The French Republic, like that
of the Romans, seems desirous of
extending its influence and autho
rity over the world, by adopting
itates and principalities into the no
ble condition of friends and allies
to theircommonwealih. Theyfeem
also to imitate the Romans in wifli
ing to retain the supreme power in
those cities to whom they impart
that privilege. Differences, dis
putes and recriminations take place
among the French Generals; but
that is no more than might be ex
perted in a nascent State, especially
in a nascent republic ; but above
all, in a wafcent French republic.
At Naples, the people aflembled,

There is a difference between the

They set limits to their vices, at
which their pursuits rested. Antl
whatever blood was (hed, flowed
gallantly in the field. The Ameri
can Revolution, it ought to be re
peated, was not accoihplilhed as the
French has been, by maflacres, aflaf

severe and honorable, were fought,
and the chance of war left to de-.

From a lati London Paper.
REMEDY FOR BRUISES.
A COACHMAN, in a street in
London, was, by a fuddenjolt,
thrown off his box, and in his tall
his foot fell inio a hollow in the
pavement,which occasioned a sprain,
attended with violent pain, and a
considerable inflammation. A bro
ther whip promised hiin a speedy
cure. He ordered a gallon of por
ter to be simmered in an earthen
reflel, till, when cooled, it became
of the confidence of a plaster. He
spread this plaster on a thin old
glove, and applied it round the an
kle. In three days he mounted his
box, being relieved of the swelling
and pain.
Another perfon,being surrounded
by pick-pockeis, in endeavoring to
save his money, fell down, & struck
one fide of his loins upon a stone
more prominent than the reft of the
pavement. Considerable pain and
swelling were the consequences ;
and next day his back, and the thigh
on that fide, became greatly disco
loured. Having seen thefuccefs of
the porter plaster in the former in
stance, I defiled that the porter
plaster might be applied to part of
the back and thigh, while the other
parts were treated according to art,
that so a comparative experiment
might be made of the effects of each.
The swelling subsided nearly equal
ly in both ; but the pain and the
blackness of flrin went off much soon
er in the parts covered with the
plaster than in the pther parts. Ac
cidents have since afforded me seve
ral instances of similar success at
tending the application oF this plas
ter. Might we not expect that fuc
cers might attend the application of
this plaster in other fixed pains in
various parts of the body ?
As these accidents happened in
London, where porter is the malt li
quor most generally used, the plas
ter was made of it; yet I doubt not
but that other fermented malt-li
quors, used in the fame manner,
might have similar effects.
Where such hurts are frequent,
this plaster may be long kept in.
good condition, jf it is covered with
a little oil to prevent the evapora.-
tion of the fluid particles. S. A.
