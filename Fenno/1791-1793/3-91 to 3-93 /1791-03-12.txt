ON AGRICULTURE,
BEING on a journey sometime ago, I put tip
at a very decent inn, and was not displeased
to find my landlord disposed to entertain me with
his conversation : He feeined to be of a cheerful
temper, and saw things on the bright fide. After
touching upon politics, which, next to the wea
ther, is the firft topic to scrape acquaintance
with, he ex-prelled his fatisfaclion that husban
dry was beginning to prosper. It was a fliaine,
he said, that freeholders should be so little ambi
tious to shew, by the fkiiful management of their
land, that it was their own. But he was happy
to find, that at last the lpirit of improvement had
reached themâthey were getting into the prac
tice of tilling no more land than they were able
to manure so well as to obtain very great crops.
This method was found to cause a considerable
saving ot labor, as well as a great incieafe of
grain. He said that the molt thrifty farmers in
the village and neighbourhood, had agreed to
meet at ltated times, under the name of the Far
mers' Club, and to communicate such ufeful ob
servations as had occurred to them. Some of the
club were direcfted to procure feeds, by way of
change, from distant parts ; others agreed, from
time to time, to make experiments, and to com
municate the result to the club. One of their
number, who was not at the last meeting, had
sent his observations in a letter. My landlord
finding that I was pleased with the letter, direct
ed his son to make me a copy of it : If you think
it will be ufeful, you may publish it.
Gentlemen,
BEING lame, I cannot, as usual, attend your
meeting ; but 1 fend you, in writing, lome ob
servations, which I intended to have communi
cated in person.
Doubtless it was decreed that we should get our
living by hard work. We have no cause to com
plain of our lot in this regard : It brings with it
many blellings, and shields us from many evils.
The scholar fits pale at his books, and even white
bread turns four on his stomach ; the Ealt wind
makes him fliiver, and the sultry South wind de
prives him of strength and spirits. We, on the
contrary, swing the scythe, without faintnefs, in
the dog days > and, iu the winter, the manage
ment of the axe keeps us warm, though uptothe
knees in snow. But though it is ordained that
we should work hard for our living, I cannot be
lieve that we are to work hard and not get it.
Yet, how many get but half a living, and go be
hind hand notwithstanding. What is thecaufe?
Is it not the low state of the noble art of husban
dry ? Io do all that is polfible to be done to im
prove it, will require great estates, great lkill,
and a very long course of time, to establish new
methods of practice. But some improvements
are obvious, within the reach of every one, even
the poorest farmer, and, if pra<ftifed, would ena
ble the poorest farmer to pay his taxes, and to
live comfortably.
We find that the produce of land is greater or
less in proportion to the manure that is laid on
it. Indeed, new lands for several years, and in
tervals near rivers, will do without; but what 1
have remarked is true, of almoftall the old lands
in the country. ]f wc could find means to in-

crease manure, it would be better to do it than
to buy more land ; for an acre, well manured,
will yield as much as two without manure the
crop is got for half the money; and in cafe of
cold wet springs, or dry summers, it is not so
likely to be cut off. All this you well know.
But perhaps you do not all know, because you
have not tried ihe mÂ£ans of increasing manure
by comport. I have tried ic, and wilh you to fol
low my example.
Adjoining the stye where your swine are {hue
up, which should be dry and warm, fence a yard
for them to wallow in ; twenty or thirty feet
1 qua re will be large enough for half a dozen hogs ;
cover this in the fall i>r spring with mud, or any
rich earth or grass sods ; common loom should
not be refufed, if richer earth cannot be procured.
1 he hogs, having no rings in their noses, will
render this mud or earth, if not more than two
feet deep, an exceeding rich conipoft in a year's
time. They will keep it llirring and fermenting
with their clung and urine, which will be incor
porated with the mud, and thereby their \yhole
strength will be saved ; for the mud or earth
will prevent the virtues of the dung and urine
from being wafiied into the ground by theheavy
rains, or evaporated by the fun and airâit not
only saves them, but makes them stronger, by
keeping them in a state of conltant fermentation
âthe fermentation will be increased, and the
whole mass will be improved by making this yard
the receptacle for the weeds of your gardenâ
throw into it your soap suds, brine, and all the
greasy flop of the kitchenâyou may add potatoe
tops, which should be carefully saved for the pur
pose when you gather the potatoes âtheftubborn
corn-stalks, which rot slowly in the cow-yard,
will soon con fume in the hog-yard. Indeed anv
vegetable or animal fubltance may be added, for
there is none which will not make manure when
rotten. Half a dozen hogs, if confined to a ftyc,
and such a yard, will make more than 20 tons of
the bell manure in one year. The manure should
be laid in heaps to mellow with the frofts of one
winter, and it will aiifwer to put into the hills of
Indian corn as well as horse dung.
It is not neceflary to tell farmers how to life
manure, nor liow much the crop will be encreafed
by it. You all know that my crops have been re
markably large, and 1 allure you that I have ob
tained them by manuring my grounds in the be
fore-mentioned manner. The dung of hogs is fin
for moll purposes, but particularly for Indian
corn, which is a great exhauster of the earth :
It ferments more llowly than hoife or sheep dung,
and furnilhes a Heady supply to carry oil the
growth of this plant to the ripening of the ear.
The dung or hogs, valuable as it is, is almost en
tirely 101 l throughout the country; and their
urine, not lei's valuable, is totally loft and ab
foibed by the ground. A thick layer of earth in
the ho'g-yard, as has been observed, not only pre
vents this lols, but improves the manure.
I advise you, therefore, to make trial of thi s
method without loft of time. Do the like in y ou r
cow-yardsâspread a thick layer of earth there,
gather all the litter and rubbish, weeds, leaves
ajid iti aw, that you can, and let the cattle tread
it into the mafsj if it should get hard trodden,
ltir it with an iron bar, or turn it up to the air
several times in the Cummer with a plough. A
diligent farmer will be surprised at the quantity
of his manure, and a fkilful one will not be at a
IoU toi methods to improve the strength of it.
It will be his own fault if the compost is inferior
in llrengtji to dung which xs unmixed with earth
01 mud. 1 his compoll will improve by lying in
Leaps, expolcd to the frofts of the winter. Spread
on giafs land, it makes fine cropsâand indeed ic
answers every purpose of dung.
Our farms will certainly grow worse, unless
we ny io increase their fertility by comports and
artificial manure. Inrtead of wearing our lands
out, and spoiling the earth we live on, it is time'
to turn our attention to the important fubjedt of
manure, after the example of England, where
husbandry is greatly encouraged. My own ex
perience has taught me that we may get better
crops, while the fruitfulnefs of our grounds /hall
be made to advance from year to year.
You fee, gentlemen, that 1 endeavor to contri
bute my mile to the benefit of the club. No mem
ber wishes it success more heartily. God prosper
the plough, is the daily prayer of your humble
servant,
PETER THRIFT.CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, Feb. 4.
The BANK BILL under conjideration,
MR. JACKSON
SAID, that having been theperfon who brought
forward the constitutional objection against
the bill, he thought himfelf bound to notice the
answers which had been offered to that objection.
Klewfpaper authorities, said he, have been allu
ded to, and their silence on the fubjecfl, consider
ed as indicating the approbation of the peopleâ
lie would meet the gentlemen on that groundâ
and tho he did not consider newspapers as an
authority to be depended on,yet if opinions thro'
that channel were to be regarded, lie would re
fer gentlemen to those of this cityâthe expedi
ency and constitutionality of the bill, has been
called in question by the newspapers of this city
The latitude contended for in construing the
constitution on this occasion, he reprobated very
fully : If the sweeping clause, as it is called,
extends to veiling Congress with such powers,
and necessary and proper means are an indispensa
ble implication in the ienfe advanced by the ad
vocates of the bill, we /hall soon be in polleflion
of all polfible powers, and the charter, under
which we set, will be nothing but a name.
This bill will eflentially interfere with the
rights of the separate Stales, for it is not denied,
that they poflefs the power of instituting hanks ;
but the proposed corporation will eclipse the
bank of North America, and contravene the in
terests of the individuals concerned in it.
He then noticed the several arguments drawn
from the doiftrine of implication ; the right to
incorporate a national bank has been deduced
from the power to'raife armiesâbut he presumed,
it would not be contended that this is a bill to
provide for the national defence. Nor could
such a power in his .opinion be derived from the
right to borrow money. It has been alked, what
the United States could do -with the surplus of
their revenue, without the convenience of a
bank, in which to depolit it with advantage >
For his part, though he wiftied to anticipate pleas
ing occurrences, he did not look forward to the
time when the general government would have
this superabundance at its disposal.
The right of Congress to purchase and hold
lands, has been urged to prove that they can
transfer this powerâbut the genei al government
is expressly reftritfted in the exercif'e of this pow
er ; the consent of the particular State to the
purchase for particular purposes only, is requi
lite ; these purposes are designated, such as
building light houses, eredling arsenals, &c.
It has been said that banks may exist without a
charter, but that this incorporation is neceflary
in order that it may have a hold on the govern
ment : Mr. Jackson strongly reprobated this
ideaâhe was, he said, aftonilhed to hear such a
declaration, and hoped that such ideas would pre
vent a majority of the house from passing a bill that
â would thus eliablifli a perpetual monopoly ; we
have (said he) 1 believe, a perpetual debt I
hope we lhall not make a perpetual corporation.
What was it drove our forefathers to this coun
try ? Was it not the ecclesiastical corporations,
and perpetual monopolies of England and Scot
land ? Shall we fufler the fame evils to exist in
this country, instead of taking every pofiible me
thod to encourage the encreafe of emigrants to
fettle among us ? For if we establish the pi ece
dent now before us, there is no faying where
it (hall flop.
The power to regulate trade is said to involve
this, as a necefl'ary means, but the powers con
sequent on this express power, are fpecifiedâ
such as regulating light-lioufes, (hips, harbors,
&c. It has been said that Congress has borrowed
money ; this {hews that there is no neceifiry of
instituting any new bank, those already establish
ed having been found fufficient for the purpose.
He denied the right of Congress to eftablilh banks
at the permanent feat of government, or on those
sand heaps mentioned yesterday ; for if they
ihould, they could not force the circulation of
their paper one inch beyond the limits of those
places. But it is said, if Congress can eftabli/h
banks in those situations, the question becomes a
queflion of place and not of principle,âfro:u
hence it is inferred that the power may be exer
cised in any other part of the United States ; â
this appeared to him to involve a very danger
ous conftrutfion of the powers verted in the ge
neral government.
Adverting to the powers of Congress in refpeft
to the finances of the union, he obfcrved that
those powers did not warrant the adoption of
whatever measures they thought jjroper: the
constitution has reftrkled the exercise of thole
fifcal powers,âCongrMs cannot lay a poll tax,
nor impose duties on exports, âyet these un
doubtedly relate to the finances.
The power exercised in respect to the Western
Territory, he observed, had reference to pro
perty already belonging to the United Stares;
it does not refer to property to be purchased,
nor does it authorise the purchase of any addi
tional property, âbesides, the powers are express
and definite, and the exercise of them in making
needful rules and regulations in the government
of that territory, does not interfere with the
rights of any of the refpetftive States.
Mr. Jackson then denied the neceflity of the
propoled institution, âand, noticing the observa
tion of Mr. Ames, that it was dangerous on mat
ters of importance not to give an opinion, ob
served, that he could conceive of no danger that
would result from poftoning that conftrutftion of
the constitution now contended for, to lome fu
ture Congress, who, when the neceflity of a hank
institution fliall be apparent, will be as eompe
tent to the decifionas the present house. Allud
ing to the frequent representations of the flou
rilhing situation of the country, he inferred that
this ihews that the neceflity of the proposed insti
tution does not exist at the present time; why
then should we be anticipating for future gene
rations ? State banl<s he considered preferable to
a national bank, as counterfeits can be deteifted
in the States, âbut if you eftablilh a national
bank, the checks wi/1 be found only in the city
of 1 hiladelphia or Oonnogochegue. He palled
an eulogiuni on the bank of Pennsylvania: the
stockholders, said le, are not speculators; they
have the solid coin iepofited in their vaults.
He adverted to the preamble and context of
the condirmion, and aflerted that this context is
to be interpreted the general powers contain
ed in the instrument; noticing the advantages
which it had been said would accrue to the Uni
ted States from the bank. He alked, is the Uni
ted States going to commence stockjobbers ? â
The " general welfare," are the two words that
ate to involve and juftify the afl'umption of every
power. But what is this general welfare ?âit is
the welfare of Philadelphia, New York and Bos
ton ; for as to the States of Georgia and New-
Hampshire, they may as well be out of the union
for any advantages ihey will receive from the
institution. He reprobated the idea of the Uni
ted States deriving any emolument from the bank,
and more especially, he reprobated the influence
which it was defigued the government should
enjoy by it. He said the banks of Venice and
Amsterdam were founded on different principles.
In the famous bank of Venice, tho' government
holds no shares, yet it has at command 5,000,000
ducats ; but the United States were to be imme
diately concerned in rheirs, and become stock
jobbers. The bank of Anifterdam was under the
entire direction of the Burgoniafters, who alone
had the power of making bye-laws for its regula
tion : this power by the bill was given tip by
government, very improperly, he thought, anil
was to be exercil'ed by the ftock-holdei s. The
French bank, he added, wasfirft eftabliffied upon
proper principles, and flouriffied ; but afterwards
became a royal bank, âmuch paper was intro
duced, which destroyed the establishment, and
was near oversetting the government.
Tlie facility of borrowing, he deprecated, it
will, said he, involve the union in irretrievable
debts: the facility of borrowing, is but another
name for anticipation, which will in its effecls
deprive the government of the power to controul
it* revenues,âthey will be mortgaged to the cre
ditors of the government: let lis beware of fol
lowing the example of Great-Britain, in this re
fpecft. He said, undue advantages had been ta
ken'in precipitating the measure, and the rea
sonable proportion refpe(fting the State debts, is
not admitted, âthis I consider as partial and un
just. A gentleman from Virginia has well ob
served, that we appear to be divided by a geo
graphical line, ânot a gentleman scarcely to the
eastward of a certain line, is opposed to the
bank, and where is the geiitleman to the south
ward that is for it. This ideal line will have a
tendency to ellablirti a real 'difference. He added
a few more observations, and concluded by urtr
inj> a postponement, if any regard was to be had
to the tranquility of the union.
HARTFORD, February 2?
The inhabitants of France are said to be 25
millions, and their national debt about 200 milli
ons sterling. This sum if divided equally a
mongft them, will amount to 81 a head. Tliofe
of Great Britain are computed at 8 millions of
inhabitantsâtheir national debt to 300 millions
sterling : this equally divided among them, a
mounvs to 371. sterling a head.âAnd those of the
United States, to about 1 million and a half of
inhabitantsâthe national debt (including state
debts) about 18 millions sterling. The fum,equal

the fsvet at States.
THAT the Congress (hall, either by declaring
the superior or supreme common law-court
of the state to be the cotirr, or by creating a new
court for the purpose, eftabli/h a General Judicial
Court in each state, the judges whereof shall hold
their commissions during good behaviour and
without any other limitation whatsoever, and
shall be appoinred and commiflioned by theflate
and shall receive their compensations from the
United States only ; and the compensations shall
not be diminished during their continuance in
office.
The number of judges of the general judicial
court in a state, nnlefs the fame should be altered
by the consent of the Congress and the legifla
tureof the state, /hall be in the proportion ofone
judge for every persons in the state, accord
ing to the enumeration for apportioning the re
presentatives among the several states ; but there
fliall always be at least three judges in each
state.
The general judicial court lhall, in all cases to
which the judicial power of the United States
doth extend, have original jurifditSion, ei:her
exclusively or concurrently with other courts in
the refpec r tive ftatcs, and otherwise reo-ulated a?
the Congress shall prescribe ; and, in cases where
the judicial power is reserved tothefeveral flutes,
as the legislature of each f'cate shall prescribe ;
â but shall have, and exclusively, immediate appel
late jurifdidtion, in all cases, from every other
court within the state, under such limitations,
exceptions and regulations, however, as fnall be
made with the consent of the Congress, and the
legislature of the state : there may, notwithfland
ing, be in each slate a court of appeals or errors
in the lad resort, nnder the authority of the
state, from the general judicial court, in cases
and on questions only, where the supreme court
of the United States hath not appellate jurisdic
tion from the general judicial court.
T he Congress may provide that the judges of
the general judicial court shall hold circuit courts
within the state ; and the legislature of the state
may, in addition to the times and places to be
afligned by the Congress, for holding the gene
ral judicial court or the circuit courts, assign other
times and places.
J he Congress may determine the number of
judges which shall be a quorum to hold a gene
ral judicial court, or a circuit court, in each re
fpetiive state.
The Congress may, in the cases to which the
judicial power of the United States doth extend,
and the legislature of the state may, in the other
cases, regulate the fees and proceedings in the

courts, within the state.
The ministerial officers of the general judicial
court shall be appointed and commissioned iii such
manner as the legislature of the state shall pre

All writs, ifiuiug out of the general judicial

The judges of the general*judicial court may
be impeached, by the house of Repi efentatives of
the United States, andalfo bythe most numerous
branch of the slate legislature.
The impeachment shall not be tried by the Se
nate of the United States, or by any judicature
undet the authority of the state, but the Congress
shall, by law, establish a court to be held in each
slate, for the trial of such impeachments, to con
sist only of Senators of the United States, judges
of the supreme court of the United States, and
judges of general judicial courts âThe trial shall
be in the state where the person impeached shall
reside, and every law, designating the judges of
a court for the trial of impeachments, shall be
palled previous to the impeachment, and the (!e
---fignation shall be, not by naming the persons.but
by describing the offices, the perfous in which
offices for the time being, and elected or appoint
ed previous to the impeachment, shall be the
judges ; and no person lhall be convicted without
the concurrence of two thirds of the judges pre
sent.
Judgments by the courts so robe ellabliflied
for the trial of impeachments, fliall not extend
further than is provided by the conftitutioll of
the United Spates, in cases of impeachments, and
the party, nevertheless. to be liable and f'ub jefft
to indictment, trial, judgment and puniflinient
according to law.
In every state where theCongrefs shall declare
the superior or supreme common law court,to be
the general judicial court, the judges fhalJ, by
>force of their appointments as judges ofthefiipe
rior or fupremecoinmon law-court, becomejudg
cs of the superior orfupreme common law-court:
And all the powers and duties of the judges of
the superior orfupreme common law-court, ei
ther by the constitution or the laws of the state,
lhall devolve on the judges of the general judi
cial court.
If 011 the establishment of the general judicial
courts the Congress shall deem proper to discon
tinue any of the diitridl courts of the United States
the judges of the courts so discontinued shall,
thereupon, by force of their appointments as di
ftritTt judges, become judges of the general judi
cial courts in the refpedlive states, and shall con
tinue to receive their compensations as thereto
fore eftablilhed.
The judges of thefupreme or fuperiorcommon
law-courts, and the diftriift judges may, on the*
firft eftablifliment of the general judicial courts,
become judges thereof, notwithstanding the li
mitation of the number of the judges of the ge
neral judicial courts in the refpetftive Urates, but
as vancancies happened they lhall not afterwards
be filled up beyond the number limited.
For avoiding of doubts, it is declared, that all
officers, as well ministerial as judicial, in the ad
miniflration of jttftice under the authority of a state,
stall also be held to execute their refpedlive offi
ces, for carrying into effedl the laws of the Uni
ted States, and, in addition to the duties assigned
to them by the laws of the state, the Congress
may assign to them luch farther duties as they
lhall deem proper for that purpose.
KINGSTON, Dec. 29
By the arrival of the Betsey yesterday evening
from London, we learn, that there were 64 pen
dants flying at Spithead, of which fifty fail were
of the line, and had in all 50,000 seamen on
board.
The sudden appearance of peace bad occasion
ed great murmur in the kingdom, which it is fear
ed would encreafe until the meeting of parlia
ment, when it was hoped their expectations would
be fatisfied in refpe<ft to the advantages the na
tion might reap from the supposed concetlion on
the part of Spain.
Every corner of theftreets in London, andou
ports, as well as all turn pikes on the poll road
had hand-bills ported up with the inscriptionâ
" NO WAR i NO PITT !"
None of the ships of war were ordered to be
paid off, nor was it expected they would, until a
full explanation was obtained and ample securi
ty given for the performance of such compenfa
tioM as Spain might offer to Great-Britain.
The general voice, when the Betsey failed,
seemed to pay very little regard to the tenor of
the convention ; the clamour sets forth, that
Great-Britain has been abused for fix months past,
with such trifling promises, as appear deroga
tory on the part of England, to pay any re
gard to them, as in the end tniniftry may be du
ped.â
Jan. r. By the late arrivals, we learn, that so
hurt are a number of people in and about Lon
don, in of the convention with Spain,
that bonfires have been made, and the minister
burnt in effigy.
Among other qtieftions put into the mouth of
Â«John Bull, by the hirelings of oppofition,is this;
If we don't go to war, pray why have we been
at all this enormous expence ? The reply to this
is obvious ! Don't form your judgment until you
are mailer of both fides of the question. Hear
â what the minilter has to fay. He has since the
vear 1782, conductedhimfelf to your fulled fatis
facftion, and there can be no doubt of his juftify
ing the line of conduct he has taken in the most
ample manner.
NEW-YORK, March j.
Extract of a letter from General M'Cillivray, date 4
Little Tallafiey 12th December, 1790, to a gentle
man in this city.
" On my arrival here I found that the Cufii
tahs had conduced themselves in a very proper
manner refpecTting the affair of fatisfacftion for
one of their men murdered in our abfeiice ; and
which we'had heard of when with you. Instead
of rushing to revenge, as is their usual custom,
they demanded fatisfaftion in formâand agreed
to wait four months for it. At the expiration of
that time, theCuflitahs were informed from good
authority, that the murderers in defiance of the
laws, were protected by an armed banditti, and a
fortnight after our return having the fame con
firmed" the Bird Tail King dispatched four young
warriors to take fat;sfa<stion, which they did in
killing a lad 011 the frontier, and this has
fully Satisfied them, and the Georgians do not
complain ; so ihisitorm is blown over, and God
onlv knows how long the present calm will lalt.
I will perhaps, be not credited when 1 observe,
that the upper Georgians never will fuffer fatis
fadtion to be given lor killing an Indian ; and,
indeed,every month affords infiances of felons a
mong them being rescued from juflice, when con
detuned for the molt atrocious offences."
Every person that but tranfietnly peruses the
news-papers of this and other countries, cannot
but observe with regret, the considerable number
of lives loft every year, either from inexperience
or carelefl'nefs in handling and playing with guns,
upon afuppofition that they are not loaded. Per
haps the superstitious idea of a certain farmer of
my acquaintance, in a neighbouring state, might
be forgiven for the fake of the beneficial effeifts
of an opinion peculiar to himfelf, and which he
couftantly inculcates upon his children, that
" the devil takes frequent opportunities to load
empty guns." Whenever any of his Â£bns [tho'
men grown] takes down a fowling piece from the
hooks, he immediately cautions (hem to " be ve
ry careful in handling it." " Father" fays one of
them " I mylelf discharged, or drew off the load,
no longer ago than yesterday, and not a foul has
touched the gun since." " No matter !" replies
the old man " put down the ram-rod, and fee
whether the devil has not loaded her in the
night !"
Warn'd by experience, always think the worst,
Nor in the hour of sport to memory trust ;
Not brib'd by frolic, or deceiv'd by fun, )
With hellish l'pite to every mother's foil, >â 
One half tbe time, old Satan loads the gun. )

FROM THE FEDERAL GAZETTE
Mr. Brown,
IN your paper of the sth of February last, under the Hartford
head, a variety of remarks are made by a correspondent, upon
General Harmar's letter to the Secretary at War, and also upon his
orders to the troops during the late expedition into the Indian
territories, which, to fay the bed I can of them, appear to me ve
ry uncandid indeed, presuming that the correspondent was not
himfelf on the expedition, and therefore must be ignorant of the
real circumstances attending it.
He (the correspondent) asks, after making some animadversions
upon the General's conduct, to which I shall not at present reply,
il Will not the continuance of such a man at the head ot the troops,
weaken our confidence in appointments ? or will men enlist un
der an officer who is capable of making such a puerile com
munication to the public ?"
To the firft question which, by the by, I never expected would
have heen asked refpe&ing that officer, well knowing his worth
and real eharafter, I give thisanfwerâlt is my sincere belief that
the President of the United States hath it not in his power to make
an appointment of any military officer, of equal rank with the Ge
neral, in whom greater confidence ought to be placed ; under this
idea, the confidenceot the public in such appointments, cannot be
1. ffened nor weakened, nor can they entertain a wish to difpÂ»ace
such an able officer from his present command.
As to the second, my reply is, that very tew during the late glo
rious levolution, recruited and brought into the field so many brave
and able bodied soldiers as he did, however " puerile his commu
nications" might at that time or since have been, and I am bold e
nough to allure the public, that men and brave men too, will fti 11
enlist under him
As a brave and dilciplined officer, as a genuine unadulterated
patriot through the m ft gloomy periods, I beg leave to represent
him. Let the inhofpuable borders of lakes George and Cham
plain, the Bi andywine, Germantown and Monmouth, all teftify
his discipline, his gallantry and his love of freedom. Let his con
duct as one of the infpeftors ot the late American army, under the
worthy Baron Steuben, and his. unifoim and steady exertions to
the Southward during a tedious and very unpromising campaign,
let his patience under fatigue and danger at York-Town, where a
whole Britifti army was captured ; and lastly, let our late glorious
Commander in Chief, now the beloved President of the United
States, bear witness of his pup&uality and accuracy in duty and
his arrlent desire of ever filling the posts of danger and ot honor.
Ye brave Americans, ye worthy officers, companions of his toils
and dangers ! I ask you why should his name be thus traduccd,and
that too, even without the specious formality of a trial ?
779
[A'. Y. D. Mv.]
Will you dcftroy your General, in imitation of barbarous Rome
who threw him that saved the Capitol, from the Tarpiiaw rock,
merely because he was defamed ! Or will you like more modern
times, calumniate and finally destroy, as was the innocent Byng,
without a fair hearing ? Or will you, to illustrate my meaning
with a (fill more recent example, oanilh him from your affeÂ£li
ons as the intrepid Hero of France, Count dc Grass , was for a
time banilhed from an ungrateful Court, because he was not so
fortunate as the 'nation hoped and expected ! virtue, hor.or and
humanity recoil and forbid the idea.
" Hear before you condemn, convict before you execute."
*N.8.8e it remembered That the nation neither hoped nor ex
pired from the late expedition more than General Harmar perform
ed, having fully executed his orders, although the bufmef was un
v fortunately attended with the iofs of fame brave ojficers and men.

ADVERTISEMENT
(flSr Refpefting the numerous complaints received, on the
failure of the Gazette oj the United States, the Editor -would inform
his subscribers, that since the firft of January last, the Mail has been
carried from this city to Baltimore, on horfe-back\ and lately the
road to New-York has been so bad, that the fame regulation has
been adopted on that route : The mercantile interest being consi
dered as the principal support of the Poft-Office, its accommoda
tion, in expediting the Mail, has given life to this arrangement â
Meantime the Stages, East and South, have plied as usual ; and the
Papers destined to Baltimore, and the louthward of that City, have
been regularly and pun&ually dispatched by them : The badnrfsof
the roads to the eastward, has sometime? prevented the Stage from
this city, reaching Powles'-Hook, in season, to have the papers
taken by the Stage bound to Boston : The public dispatches fre
quently occupy the greatest part of the Mail-Portmanteaus, and the
impoflibiiity of Uanfporting on horjcbach, those ot a furticient size
to contain the letters, public difpatche.% and the nezespapers, all ac
the fame time,often occasions the detention of the latter at the poft
office, for many days, after they are lrft there to be transmitted.
The foregoing are the only reasons that the Editor can assign
for the recent d'fappointments, having never failed in a firigle in
stance to have the Papers prepared in season.
As the original design of this publication was to diffufe infor
mation to all parts of the Union from the feat of government, a*
trom a common centre, and the paper has received very general
approbation, and a more extenfivc circulation than perhaps any
other Newspaper ever publifhcd in Amcricaâthe Editor hopes

Jtreams of water, so dilpcrfed as 10 afford great opportunity of
making watered meadow of the firft quality,perhaps more than 300
acresâof which 120, in one body, is already in gr,ils, and all wa
