WE (hall now content ourselves with recit
ing the summary of this firft civil war.
After the publication of declarations and mani
feltoes, the two armies take the field. The
Queen mother wishes to avoid a war, and procure
peace: She negociates an interview for this pur
pore with the Prince of Cotide, but without suc
cess : She continues however to negociate an ac
commodation, and obtains a conclusion of it.â
The prince repentsof it, by the persuasion of his
partizans, and resumes his arms. He attempts in
the night to fur prize the royal army: His enter
prize succeeds not. The King receives power
ful reinforcements from Germany and Switzer
land. The Prince of Conde is obliged to (hut
liimfelf up in Orleans, and separate his army,
â which he could not hold together in a body.â
He fends to demand succours in Germany and
England, andconfents to deliver Havre de Grace
to the Englilh, and receive their garrisons into
Rouen and Dieppe. Tne Queen, irritated and
afflitfted at these resolutions, joins the Catholic
party, and declares the Hugonots, rebels. The
royal army takes Blois, Tours, Poitiers, and Bour
ses. The ijth of Sept. 1562, it lays siege to
Rouenâin the course of which, the King ot Na
varre, visiting the trenches to reconnoitre the
(late of the place, was wounded in the left should
er, by a shot of an Arquebufe, which broke the
bone, wounded the nerves, and felled him to the
ground as if he were dead. He was carried im
mediately to his quarters, where all the other
generals afleinbled. The surgeons who drefled
his wounds, in the presence of the King and
Queen, judged it mortal, because the ball had
penetrated too far, into the body.
The 26th of October 1562, the city was carried
by allkult, and the whole army entered, making
ail horrible carnage of ihe garrison and inhabi
tants, by putting to the sword, without any quar
ter, all who presented tliemfelved armed or un
armed : The city was delivered up to be plun
dered, except the churches and consecrated
things, which the soldiers were made to fefpetfl,
by the vigilance and good discipline of the ge
nerals.
The King of Navarre, fuffering under the
pains of his wound, and wounded in spirit al
lnoft as much as in body, infilled on embarking
on the Seine, to be tranfportea to Saint Maur, a
pleasure-house near Paris, where he often went
to take the air, and enjoy the tranquility of so
litude. He scarce arrived at Andeli, a few
leagues from Rouen, when his fever was aug
mented by the agitation of the batteau, he loft
his senses, and died in a few hours. He united
to his high birth, an elegant pei-fon, and a foft-
Jiefs of manners : If he had lived in other times,
and under a better conftitutipn of government,
he might have been reckoned among the great
ell I rincesof his age ; but the candor and sin
cerity of his heart, the sweetness and affability
of his difpolition, in the midst of political trou
bles, and civil diflentions, served only to hold
him in continual agitation and inquietude, In
constant in his projects, and uncertain in his re
solutionsâdrawn away on one fide by the impe
tuous charailer of his brother, and excited by
the party of the Calvinifts, in which he long
held the fir ft rankârestrained on the other hand
by motives of honor, as he thought, by his na
tural inclination for peace, and aversion for ci
vil wars, he discovered on many occasions but
little firmnefs or constancy in his designs. Pla
ced in the number of those, who lay under the
reputation of seeking to disturb the state, he
shared in their disgraceâand he was seen after
wards, at the head of the opposite party, pet T
eeming those, whom he had formerly protected.
In point of religion, foinetimes allured to Calvi-
Jiifm, by the nerfuafions of his wife, and the dis
courses of Theodore Bezaâand sometimes bro't
back to the Catholic faith, by the torrent of fafh
ion, and the eloquence of the Cardinal of Lor
raine, he gained the confidence of neither party,
and left in his dying moments, suspicious and e
quivocal ideas of his creed. Many thought, that,
though he was in his heart attached to c. Ivinifm,
or rather to the confeffion of Augsburg, lie sepa
rated from the Hugonots from secret views of
ambitionâand fuffering impatiently that the
Piince his brother by his valor and greatness of
foul had acquired among them more efteeni than
himfelf, he chole rather to hold the firft rank a
mong the Catholics than the fccond among the
Calvinifts. He died at the age of forty- two, in
a time when his prudence increasing with age,
lie might perhaps have furpalfed the opinion
which had been conceived of him. Jane of Al
bret, his widow, continued in pofl'effion of the
title of Queen, and of what remained of Navarre.
She had two children, Henry, Prince of Beam,
then nine years of age, and afterwards the all
glorious Henry the fourth of France, and the
Princess Catharine, then very young. Their
mother lived with them atPau and at Nerac, su
pervising their education in the new religion.
The Prince of Conde, reinforced by the auxil
iary forces from Germany, makes hade to attack
Paris. The King and Queen return thither with
their army, and after various negociations the
Prince is constrained to depart. The two armies
march towards Normandyâa memorable battle
is fought at Dreue, where the Prince of Conde
is made prisoner by the Catholics, and the Con
stable by the Hugondts. In the firft onletof this
action, Gabriel of Montmorency, the son of the
Constable, had been killed, the Comte of Roche
fort had been thrown from his horse, and loft his
life, and the catholics, in fpightof all their bra
very, began to give way. The German cavalry
armed with pistols, and divided into two large
squadrons, having joined the Admiral in this
critical moment, made a fre(h charge with such
fury, that they broke the Catholics, and forced
them to fly. The Constable who fought in this
placewith great bravery, exerted himfelf in vain
to stop and rally the fugitives : His horse fell
under him, and he was wounded in the left arm,
surrounded by the Germans, and made prisoner,
after having seen perish at his fide, the Duke of
Nevers, and several other officers of distinction.
The Prince of Conde, in charging the cavalry
of the Duke of Guise, was afterwards wounded
in his right hand, and covered over with blood,
and dull and sweat, was made prisoner by Dam
ville, who, wishing to avenge the capture of his
father, fought with desperation. The Duke of
Guise remained mailer of the field of battle, the
baggage and artillery of his enemy. The Prince
of Conde was brought into the presence of his
conqueror, and it was a memorable scene to fee
those two famous men, whom past events, and
especially the la(t bartle, had rendered implaca
ble enemies, reconciled at once by the caprice of
fortune, sup at the fame table, and for want of
other lodgings, and better accommodations, pass
the night in profound sleep, on the fame bed.
Those who firft: fled from this acflion, carried
to Paris the firft news of the defeat and captivity
of the Constable, and threw the Court into deep
mourning and great inquietudes. They were
diflipated however, a few hours afterwards, by
the Captain of the King's guards being dispatch
ed by the Duke of Guise. The news which he
spread, and the aff'urances which he gave of the
vicfiory gained by the Catholics, diminished the
grief caused by the death of so many brave men,
whose loss had put all France in mourning. Be
sides the Lords and Knights, of diftinguilhed no
bility and reputation, they reckoned eight thou
sand men among the slain. The Duke of Guise
acquired a glory without bounds by this vitfiory,
which gave a great check to the Hugonots. ' The
King and Queen declared him General of the ar
my, and he took the rout to Orleans, that he might
not leave his enemy the time to repair their lofles.
N A M U R, Nov. 2.
AT half an hour pad ten o'clock in the morn
ing of the 30th of O>ftober the laboratory of
one of the powder magazines of this town took
fire in the part destined for making cartridges
It blew up, and destroyed a considerable part of
the quarter in which it wasfituated.
Four hundred persons and a great number of
children were the victims of this disaster, which
does not appear the effedl of chance, as twice be
fore matches had been found evidently disposed
with a design to accafion an explosion.
Some time before two patrols of Patriots, con
sisting of 400 men each, met in the night. 111-
flead of crying, " Qui vivi /" as usual, the com
mander of one of the parties spoke in German.
Deceived by this the other patrol fired. The

Extratt of a letter from Quebec, to the Editor, da-
ted February 10.
" I enclose you a paragraph, cut out of our
Gazette, of 2d December, refpeifting the anions
with the Indians, ir. your Weflern territoriesâ
That publiflied in your Gazette ; I had reprint
ed hereâit certainly is more consistent; however
you may be allured, the loss of the lavages was
not great.
" It is not supposed here, that government will
give them any support, particularly as they are
iituated on your fide of the boundaries. The
Indians with whom the furr-trade is carried on,
lye to the N.W. of us and the lakes,from whom it
is not probable you will receive any encroach-
mems."
Advices from Detroit, as late as the 6th of No
vember, received by yesterday's port, inform us
of two aifiions fought between the Indians, and
part of Governor St. Clair's army, in the Miamis
country. y
We have reason to believe the following to be
as accurate an account of these events, as has yet
come to the knowledge of the public :
The American army consisting of 2700 men,
1000 of which were horse, had made a very rapid
movement by the 14th Otftober, to within nine
leagues of the Miamis villages ; the Shawnefe,
and Potowatomeis, after destroying their own
villages, and what grain they could not remove,
[they allowed the Indian traders fettled among
them to remove every thing but ammunition] en
camped about 800 strong at some distance from
the ipot, and were attacked on the 16th by the
1000 horse, who they defeated after killing about
300 âthe remainder retreated to the main body;
on the 20th the Indians being reinforced, attack
ed that body and defeated them with the loss of
250, or more ; and from the daily growing
strength of the Indians, who were determined
to purJue the retreating army of the Americans ;
news of a general engagement was hourly expect
ed when these accounts left Detroit : Such Ame
rican prifoneri as they took, [after endeavour
ing to learn what the designs of them were,which
they said was, to erect some forts, for theprefent
and to attack Detroit in the Spring] they killed.
By letters from persons near the place, it is
said, very few of the American army will reach
their homes ; had not a chief of the Ottawa Na
tion dreamed they would not lucceed if they at
tacked that day, the major part of the American ar
my would, on the second engagement, have been
cut off.
The Indians have called on Major Smith, and
the officers in the Indian department, to know
what alfiltance they are to expert, and fay, it
Great-Britain will not affifl. them, they will go
over to the Spanifli lines, and we must abide the
consequences.

HOUSE OK REPRESENTATIVES
SATURDAY, Feb. j.
The BANK BILL under confideralion,
MR. SMITH, (S. C.)
OBSERVED, That he considered it his duty
to offer the reasons which (hould influence
him in giving his vote on this occalion. He had
wiflied amendments to the bill, as some parts of it
he confefled, did noj perfectly please him, but his
wilhes having been over-ruled, the question now
is, Whether the bill /hall pass ? Tho lie caine from
the southward of the Patowmac, the principle
of the bill met his approbation : It would be a
deplorable thing, said he, if" this government
ihould en ad; a law subversive of the constitutionâ
or that so enlightened a body as the Senate of
the United States, Ihould, by so great a majo
rity, as were in favor of this bill, pass a law,
so hostile to the liberties of this country, as the
opposition to this ineafure have suggested the
bankfyftemtobe;andit would be very extraordi
nary if an officer of this government, who has
produced a performance explanatory of the con
llitution, of such celebrity, as to be resorted to
as an authority, Ihould be so inconsistent with
himfelf as to propose a law entirely subversive of
the principles laid down in his able defence of
the constitution.
He then adverted to the obje&ion drawn from
that article of the constitution, that no prefer
ence ftiall be given to one port over another : He
Ihewed that the clause was inserted for a parti
cular purposeâand could not be cited as a rule
not to be deviated fromâas a preference was
and must neceflarily be given to one port over
another. He produced numerous instances in
point in consequence of various clauses in the re
venue lawsâgeneral regulations sometimes ope
rate partiallyâand commercial arrangements,
apparently unequal, produce the good of the
community at large.
In reference to construing the Constitution,
lieobferved, that the present momenr, when the
powers of the government were aflailed from va
rious quarters, he conceived the molt improper
to contract tliofe powers.
The right to construe the constitution he ar
gued from the principles advanced by Mr. Madi
son, in the debate on the power of removability,
and read sundry observations from Lloyd's Re
gister, made by that gentleman, corroborative of
this sentimentâThose arguments he conceived
applied very aptly to the present fubjeft.
Matters of a fifcal nature necefl'arily devolve
on the general government, and he urged, that
every power resulting from the acknowledged
right of Congress tocontroul the finances of this
country, must be as neceflarily implied, as in the
cafe of the power of removability.
He then alluded to the expediency of a nation
al bank : The Secretary gave notice in his firft
report, that this plan was in contemplation.â
Nothing was ever read with gi eater avidityâand
tho it is now more than a year since this intima
tion was givenâyet no obje<ftions have been of
fered against it, either by the States or by iudi
vidualsâeven the State of North Carolina have
not mentioned it.â[Here Mr. Bloodworth, (if
the Editor did not misunderstand him) informed
Mr. Smith, that the report had not been ieen by
the legislature of North Carolina.] Mr. Smith
said he was sorry for itâand then proceeded to
notice some partial quotations, made by Mr. Jack
son, from Dr. Smith's Wealth of Nations, against
banlc systems : He said he could have wished the
gentleman had been more copious in his quota
taions from that authorâif he had, he would
have found that that author has fully demon
strated their utility.
He noticed the division of opinions on the sub- I
jetft of a national bank in the city of Philadel
phiaâhe supposed ideas of personal advantages
induced these opposing sentimentsâhe however
ihought this fubjedt {houkl be taken up altogeth
er on general principles ; and even if its imme
diate influence Should not extend to the extremes
of the union, if the establishment promises a ge
neral preponderating advantage, local confeder
ations must be confideredina secondary point of
view.âThe principal enquiry is, will the Insti
tution facilitate the management of the Finan
ces ? This he thought had been made apparent.
This is the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea
i'ury, after due and mature consideration of the
fubjedt; he certainly enjoys the best means for
forming an opinionâhe is at the head of the
fifcal department, an'd deservedly enjoys the pub
lic confidence : Very little has been offered to
disprove his sentiments on this part of the ques
tionâand the inexpediency of the measure ihould
be clearly proved before the plan , is rejetftedâ-
for an officer who deservedly enjoys the public
confidence, is entitled to the support of the legi
llature in those plan 3 which are expedient and
constitutional. _ 4
Mr. Smith mentioned iuftances, in which Con
gi ess exercised power by implication and ob
served, that this was neceflary to the execution ol
the duties which devolve on the government by
the Constitution : The power to eftablijh a nation
al bank niuft reside in Congrefsâfor 110 indivi
dual State can exercise any such powerâThe
right of no particular itate is therefore infringed
by the institution : It had repeatedly been said,
that Philadelphia would derive peculiar advan
tages from the Bank of the United Statesâ-but he
observed, if theprefent plan fliould fail, it was a
queltion whether the Stockholders of the Bank
of North-America, would not derive greater ad
vantages from the necessity which in that cafe
government would be under of refortingto them
for loans. The inltitution as before observed,
is founded on general principlesâand will un
doubtedly in its operations prove of general
utility.

may at once perce : ve, by infpe&ion, the relation and dependence
which one letter has upon another. To which is annexed, a Dia
logue, calculated to fix the attention of children, and impress their
minds with right ideas of the letters. This work is defi'gned for
the benefit of schools, and may be used with advantage by all who
would acquire a knowledge of pcnmanfhip.
Five of the remaining fix are proper Writing Books, with Cop
perplate Copies, and are designed as an execution of the foregoing
plan, each book proceeding by regular steps, from the firft princi
ples to Joining-hand Copies, and gradually proceeding from a
large Round-hand, to an easy Running-hand; all which are pre
paratory to the seventh and last book, which is a colle&ion of
Writing Pieces, Promissory Notes, Orders, Receipts, Bills of Ex
