PARIS, January 15.
Of the plot for the assassination of the King,
all the authentic intelligence we art yet in pos
session of, amounts to this "At a secret fitting
of the Jacobine club in the Rue Saint Honore,
Monf. Carva, a great leader of that ami
the conductor of a republican or rather regicide
oaper, formally proposed* to the meeting to de
throne and set aside the whole family of the
Bourbons, and to fettle the crown upon the Duke
of Yorkâthis, said Monf. Carva, is abfolntely ne
cefl'ary for us if we are determined to be free ;
with a new dynaily we may stipulate for the
principles which unite us, and the firft public
functionary mult defend them with force and
with sincerity if he will defend the throne which
is reared upon their base. These are the only
means to regenerate the face of the empire, eve
ry other measure is contrary to theTyftetn of li
berty ; which governs all our politics."
L O N DON, February 24.
It is hoped that the failure of one of our firfi
houses in the city for near Boo,oocl. will flop the
career of speculation iti articles necefl'ary tor the
lupport of foine of our principal manufactures,
whereby the community at large have been great
ly injured : as the bulk ofthefe monopolies will
now be thrown in the market, the prices will na
turally decline, and it is to be wilhed by every
friend to the commercial and manufacturing m
terells of this country, that the dangerous spirit
of enormous speculations and monopolies may
lubfide.
A Minister who will come forward, as Mr.
Pitt did, and Hate, that in conl'equence of the
revenue exceediug the expenditure he was ena
bled to repeal certain taxes which affected the

which is easily understood, and easily felt.

The Emperor has iifued a most nngular order

they consist oj three volumes, and ke not written m the

His success in inoculation is most remarkable â
formerly the fmal)-pox carried off a fifth part ot
the inhabitants ; now hardly any fuffer by the
disorder. Unafiifted by education, mid unfet
tered by the rules of art, he has inoculated manv
ihoufands, without losing a single patient. In
place of procuring frefh matter, as is the com
mon practice, he keeps it for years dried in ,
spoke, and put under ground, which from expe
rience he finds leflens its virulence, and renders
it milder to the patient. He uses 110 lancet, but
gently raises the Ikin with a knife of his own
making, so that no blood follows. A bit of cab
bage leaf is nfed as a plaster to heal the wound.
: There is no instance of it ever miTgiving, nor is
there any previous preparation used.
The Weft-India merchants have voted a pre
sent of jool. to Captain Bligh, of his Mnjefty's
navy, as a compliment for services 1 endered while
06 the Weft-India station.
They have also voted a present of a handsome
sword, value 2001. to Captain Samuel Hood, of
the navy, for favirfg, at the hazard of his own
life, while on the Weft-India liation, the lives
of three seamen, who were floating at the mercy
of the waves, on a raft of timber. The captain
himlelf left his (hip in a very high sea attended
only by his Coxswain, after an ineffectual remon
strance with the whole crew (none of whom dar
ed venture) and with the greatest danger and
difficulty picked the poor fellows up, and brought
thetn on board.
SWEDISH DIET, Geste, Jan. 31.
On the 27th inft. the Diet of the kingdom was
opened by his Majelty in per foil. The lour or
ders were united in the grand Hall.âBy the
speech which his Majesty pronounced, he traced,
in the rapid and flowery style so peculiarly his
own, the weak and diftraiTted (late in which he
found the kingdom on his comingtothe throne;
the prompt and complete success with which'he
regenerated it ; the happinefswhich the Swedes
enj >yed under his reign for many years ; the in
quietude, thedivifions, the spirit of party, which
at length troubled its welfare ; the meafiifes that
he took to repair the evil ; the glorious end of
the foreign war, connected with tliefe domestic
troubles ; the diftrefling lituatioti of the financ
es, which was the refulc of all this ; and, in fine,
for here came forth the objedt, the neceflity that:
there was for rettoring them, and for maintain
ing the credit of the (tate. This was, in truth,
the motive and end of the convocation ; whether
it will precisely conclude as he wilhed, time mult
determine.
Already foine indications of hoflility to the
King have appeared. In spite of the injun<ftion
to all the civil and military officers, the firTt or
der did not fail to be very numerous. There
were 118 members of the firfl order, no of the
I'econd, 187 of the third, or of plain gentlemen.
There were warm debates on the choice of a
Secretary of* the Diet ; the plurality was in fa
vor of the Sieur de Sogerftrom. The Sieur Wal
lin, a Burgo-mafler of Stockholm, was elecled
orator or president of the order of bourgeois.
But the point on which they have manifelted a
spirit of opposition, is in eflablifhing a revision
of accounts, which was not done according to
the recommendation of the monarch. His ma
jelly wrote in a rone very energetic on the fub
jetft, but they were equally firm, and would not
accept of the plan offered for this important ob-
I jets.
PHILADELPHIA.
Many individuals in every part of the Unitect
States, are interested in the followingâbeing a
fe<Ttion of an adt of the Legislature of Virginia,
palled the 27th of December, one thousand seven
hundred and ninety, intitled, " An ast to amend
the a<ft, intitled, An a<ft to remedy abuses in the
manner of felling lands for the payment of pub-
lie taxes."
And be it further evaded. That in cafe the tax
on any trart of land within this Commonwealth
dial) not be paid for the space of three years, the
right to such lands ftiall be loit, forfeited and
veiled in the Commonwealth, and it Ihall be law
ful for any person to acquire a title to any land
so forfeited, in the manner prescribed for ac
quiring titles to wade aÂ«d unappropriated land*
within this Commonwealth, on the Eallern wa
ters. by an art, intitled " An adl to dispose of
the waste and unappropriated lands in the Com
monwealth of Virginia, on the Eallern waters."PITTSBURGH, April 21.
Saturday last failed from this place, with a de
tachment of men to protect the fertlement at
Galliopolis, Lieutenant Demler.of the 2d United
States regiment*
Thursday last arrived here from Fort Frank
lin, Lieut. Jeffers of the lit United States regi
ment, with a party of Seneca Indians, to scout
on oar frontiers with the spies & 6 months levies.
We are happy to contradisft, in part, the pa
ragraph under the Pittlburgh head, in our last,
giving an account of the murder of 20 persons
by the Indians, as from well authenticated ac
counts it appears, that only one woman and Mr.
Edgar were killed.
We are enabled to inform our readers from
good authority that Capt. Paul, who is stationed
on the south-west frontier of Walhington county,
Pennsylvania, has eredted a very strong ,block
house on the Ounkard branch of Whelen creek,
a little above Mr. Ryerfon's mills, from whence
he makes almost daily excurfionsover the neigh
bouring grounds ; by his vigilance, and the co
operation of his subaltern officers, who have near
ly completed two other block houses, one on his
left, the other on his right, each at a few miles
distance, it is expedted he will completely thwart
the designs of any small parties of the savages
that may approach that part of our frontier.
Besides those Indians which carried off and
scalped the two boys mentioned in our laft,there
are evident signs of several small parties having
prowled along the south-west frontier of Walh
ington and Ohio counties, particularly on Whe
len, weft of the Pennsylvania boundary.
Friday the 13th inft. arrived here the Western
Experiment, Capt. Nicholfon. She is bound to
New-Orleans, from thence with a cargo to Phi
ladelphia was built about thirty miles up the
Monongahela, burthen about 60 tons, and draws
eight feet water. This is the firft veflel con
ftru&ed on this branch of the Ohio intended to
navigate the ocean.

has been inverted in the deferred stock of the
United States, which stock is entered in the

That the residue of the monies received on
the firft payments still remain in the banks
where they were originally deposited.
Ordered that the foregoing report be pub

We hear that a special meeting of the Direc.
tors is called to meet at Newark on Tuesday
the i jth day of May next, for fixing upon the
permanent feat of the said faflory.
N E W-Y O R K, April 27.
In consequence of the rife of flocks and a check
to failures, our profpe<sts now begin to brighten
up, and by the prevalence of a spirit of mutual
accommodation there can be no doubt of a spee
dy return of confidence and credit, and that bu
siness will re-aflume its natural course on a more
permanent basis.
We learn from Philadelphia, that Robert Mor
ris, Esq. has engaged a person who has had the
principal lead in conducting the canals lately fi
nifhed in England, and who is highly recom
mended for his knowledge in this line. This
gentleman is now on his paflage to America, and
daily expected. After exploring and determin
ingon the immediate operations in Penni'ylvania,
which will employ him two or three weeks, he
is then to come to thiscity for the fame purpose.
CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
FRIDAY, March 9.
The House took into consideration the report oj the
committee of the who/e on the petition of Catharine
Greene
THE report being readâa memorial of Henry
Hill was presented by Mr. Fitzfimons, pray
ing that no law may be pafled in the cafe which
may operate to the injury of the petitioner in
refpetfi to an aflignment made to him of a cer
tain demand against the United States, by one of
the partners of Banks and Co. Mr. F. recapitu
lated the general objections which had been be
fore urged against the indemnification, and con
cluded by amotion in which it was proposed that
the bufineis should be put into a train of legal
investigation.
Mr. Baldwin after some remarks highly favor
able to General Greene's charatfer, observed,
that a legal process in this cafe did not appear to
offer those accommodations which a f'ubjetft of this
kind seemed to call for.
He then entered into a general consideration
of the subject, in the course of which he observ
ed, that certain bold and striking traits diftin
guiflied the conduct of General Greene during
the late warâhe acted as a soldier, a politician,
a legislator, a com miliary, a quarter niafter and
a General, in short like a man who was conduct
ing a revolution on the success of which his own
life depended and the liberties of his country,
perhaps of mankind. He then adverted to the
evidence which has been adduced to (hew that
no partnership existed between General Greene
and Banks, and that the engagements he enter
ed into were on a public account. He said the
characters of those who had solemnly teftified 011
this occasion were such as to banifli every trace
of suspicion from his mind. He concluded by
observing that if ever a claim on the justice and
humanity ot a country existed the present was
such a claim.
Mr. Steele said he hoped the report would not
be agreed to. He said the fobjert appeared now
to be involved in more complexity than it at firft
appeared to be attended with.
In all appropriations of money the fubjetft
ought to be well considered ; but what have the
gentlemen who report the refelutions done ?
Inflead of producing that evidence which would
pass in any court of justice, they hare adduced
General Greene's character, virtues, services, &c.
of these he had as jufl an opinion as any one, but
he thought they were not altogether pertinent
to the occasion.
He hoped a further inveftigawon would be
made; and that if the report was not rejected,
the bufincfs would be put in a different trainâ
various and contradictory statements have taken
place in the courfeof the discussion in 6 weeksâ
these things were at least very extraordinary
some things are now admitted which were before
denied. As the advocates of the report have
founded their arguments on the character of
General Greene, he thought it his duty to bring
forward some circumstances, which, though they
do not impeach his character as a soldier and a
brave manâyet they show his want of sincerity
and consistency. He then adverted to the letters
which he wrote, abusing the people south of the
Potowmac, at the very time he was experiencing
their munificence and liberality. These things
he said he mentioned not to injure his reputation,
but to (hew that full credit! ought not to be given
to his subsequent aiTertions and declarations. He
observed that the fnbject had not been so fully in
vestigated, nor had such evidence been adduced
as would juftify an appropriation of the sum of
60,0c0 dollars. He then took noticeof thole do
cuments which appeared to favor the idea that
General Greene was connected with Banks and
Co. thisbufmefs he thought had not been placed
in the most fatiÂ»fac r tory point of lightâa more
thorough investigation ought to take place, and
in order to this he said the ljufinefs had better
be postponed to the next fefllon.
Mr. Clark was opposed to agreeing to the re
portâhe offered several objections ariling from
the obscurity which invelope the tranfacftions.
Mr. Hillhoufe stated sundry reasons why he
Should vote against the reportâand then the
House adjourned without deciding the question.
MONDAY, March 26
The bill for establishing a mint was read the
third timeâon the question, lhall the bill bass !
422
Mr. Clark said he hoped the bill would be r*.
je<ftedâhe cenfidered the plan as too extensive
and expensiveâthat there was no neceflity for jt
âall that is wanted at present is a coinage of
small change ; and for this purpose he had no
idea that it wat necelfary to incur an expenceof
30,000 dollars per annum. He c-ould conceive of
no immediate advantage to result from the efta
blifhmeni but that of encreafing the ministerial
phalanx which he conceived was alrerdy fuffi.
ciently strong.
Mr. Nile 6 spoke against the billâhe saw no
advantage that would result from it, but an ex
pence and loss ; he enlarged 011 the want of po
licy and economy in contemplating a recoinage
of the foreign coins now in circulation.
Mr. Gerry moved that the bill fliould be re
committed for the purpose of refloring a clause
which had been struck out, and that was the
one which provided for the Presidents' Head
being on the coinâhe should move for an amend
ment by striking out the words " for the time
being," as he would wish to leave it in the pow.
er of the legislature at a future period to with
hold this mark of public honor from an unwor
thy character should such an one. ever fill the
Chair of the fii ft magillrateâwith refpecft to the
present Chief Officer of this government he con
ceived that there could be 110 poflible objection
to doing him this honor, for in that light he con
sidered it ; it was not probable nor perhaps pos
sible that any other charadter that would ever ap
pear on the stage would so completely merit this
mark of diftintftion.
Mr. Sedgwick said he hoped the bill would not
be recommitted merely for the purpofemention
ed. He had objected to the decapitation of the
President by striking his head from the coin, but
he truftedtlie clause would yet be restored with
out the formality of a recommitment.
Mr. Page said he had intended to move for a
recommitment, but not for the purpose hinted at
by the gentleman who made the motion ; his ob
ject would have been to recommit generally he
then stated several objections to the bill, particu
larly the expence contemplated. He added some
remarks in answer to Mr. Gerry's observations.
The motion for recommitting was negatived
by a great majority.
The bill was then patted ayes 52 ânoes 22

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
A LAW is the will of the community collected and exprefT
ed hv the representatives. Yet as every law is to be en
lorced, it implies, that the will of some persons is croifed, and
made to bend to the will or law of the whole society. It is
alwayseafy for such persons to cry out tyranny, arbitrary
POWER WE HAVE ESCAPED BRITISH DOMINATION, AND BE
HOLD WE HAVE ONE SPRINGING UP IN THE MIDST OF US THAT
insists on being obeyed. The proper remedy against the
evil tendency of such intemperate appeals to the passions of
the people, is to remind them that the law is their will, that
when the law is reiifted, tney are inftilted and difobeved, that
government is their authority deposited in the hands of their
servants, and that the dominion of the people ex#rcifed by a
government of their free choice, however compared to British
power, and denominated arbitrary by audacious scribblers, is
the most durable, ufeful and complete liberty that can be en
joyed by men.
As the will of some is controuled by every law, it happens
also that the interest and advantage of others is promoted by
it. It is eafv in this cafe, to hold up to the envy of some, and
to the anger of many these advantages, and to accuse the go
vernment of partiality. It would be little to the praise of a j
law to fay, that no person is the better for it, and yet if *ny
person is benefited, the newspapers tell us that all others are
fufforers. This is the cafe of the funding law, and the com
plaints against Congress bear this impreflion. It h 110 bad
compliment to the government to bring against it ac
cusations in this style only. The reproach of a bad govern
ment, and the ordinary complaint against its proceedings is,
the oppreilion of the people by law. Congress is not accused
of opprefling any order of men, for every order of men is thri
ving. and industry in general is promoted by the protection of
the laws of the nation. The charge is, that Congress has

railed tiia value of the debt by the funding law, and t!ir? is
called partial and unjult. Was there ever fucu a charge !
J he debt was due, and common justice required the payment.
But fuppofethat Congress had struck the certificates dead at
once, by refufing to fund or provide for them. Would such a
meal'ure have been deemed by tiie present race of fault-find
ers jult, impartial, and republican. These very men would
have iuug in a louder note âCongress is bound to proteftthe
rights of property, yet it has violated them. The burden
mould be common, yet the whole loss is thrown upon the few
certificate holders. This unjult:, tyrannical, partial, cruel
oppression eltablilhes Congreis as a despot with an absolute
exjntroul oyer propertyânot by equal taxes and equal laws,
but by arbitrary decrees, as base, as cruel, as subversive of
order, of confidence, of liberty, as thole which iflue from the
Divan ol Constantinople. What answer could Congress have
made to these just reproaches ! Happily they listened to these
reasons at the time of palling the law, and the world will not
be lo much imposed upon, as to believe that they have paired
an unjust partial law, because they have respected tin; rights of
property and the dictates of common justice. Every friend of
his country will join in the wifli that Congress may never de
serve the praise ot tholfe who now censure it, by conforming
its measures to their deftruc'tivc principles.
Philadelphia, May 2.
Yesterday and the day before the Indian Chiefs and Warriors
of the Six Nations took their departure from this city.
Proposals, we hear, have been made for cash, or the debt to
be redeemed therewith, from 12/"to 12/2, for the whole amount
ot the 936,000 dollars, which Pennsylvania had to fell, in order
to redeem the State debts thereof. This, at this particular
j un&ure, is a proof of the good credit of the public, notwith
standing late embarrajlments.
A gentleman of high reputation declared in his place in Con
gress, in a late debate, that the Bank of the United States, of
which he is a director, had not fuffered and were not likely to
fuller any loss by the late fall in the price of flocks. This is
a very fatisfaftory proof that the Bank is administered on ve
ry fafe and solid principles.
On Saturday last failed for London the fbip William Penny
Capt. Jofiah, in which went the following passengers :
Phineas Bond, Esquire, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for
the states of New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Ma
ryland. %
Dr. Segur, Mrs. Segur, Mr. Ebenezer Breed, and four
French Gentlemen and a Lady.
The jewels worn by the Duchess of York, on the Queen of
England's birth night, are estimated at 40,0001. value.
Forty-two new carriages were launched on the above occa
sion.
By the latest accounts it appears that the French emigrants
have taken their departure from Coblentz, and are rendez
vousing at Ettenhehn, in the Biihopric of Stralburgh.
On Saturday last, the 2ift of April instant, the cause of Col
let, versus Collet, was argued in the Circuit Court of the li
nked States, for this diftridt, before the Judges Wilson, Blair,
and Peters. It came before the court on a bill filed on the e
quity fide, and a plea to the jurifdidtion. The bill stated the
complainant to be u a fubjedl of his Britannic Majesty, and
that the respondent was a citizen of Pennsylvania." The plea
averred the complainant to be 16 a. citizen of Pennfylvaria."
This plea, if true, deprived the court of its jurifdi&iou, as the
courts of the United States, have no right to take cognizance
of controversies between the citizens of the same state,unlcfs
in some particular and excepted cases.
In order to prove the point alledged by the respondent, he
offered in evidence a certificate dated the 30th of April, 1790,
granted by the then Mayor of Philadelphia, declaring that the
complainant had, on that day taken before him the oath of
allegiance to the state of Pennsylvania, agreeably to an ast of
assembly, bearing date the 13th March, 1789.
To combat this evidence, the complainant shewed that he
was a native of the Isle of Man, parcel of the dominions of the
Britilh crown, and contended that the naturalization granted
to him by the authority of Pennsylvania, was absolutely null
and void; for that by the Bth feftion of the firft article of the
Constitution of the United States, they have power " to make
uniform laws for the naturalization of foreigners and by
their ast bearing date the 26th of March, I79Â°> had actually
exercised this authority.
The queflion turned entirely upon the point, whether the
power given by the constitution to the legiilature of the
United States was exclnfive of, or concurrent with, the au
thority of the individual ftatesFor if it was exclusive, then
the individual states had no right to legislate on the fubjeft of
" naturalization,-" and whatever had been done by the state
of Pennsylvania, was absolutely null and void.
It was argued at large by Mr. Randolph, Attorney-General
of the United States, and Mr. Sergeant, in support of the
bill, and Mr. Levy in support of the exception.
Their honors the Judges, after confutation with each other,
declared their opinion, That the power given to the United
States was meant as a guard against the narrow regulations
that might at any future time be adopted by the individual
states, to check the admiflion of aliens, not as a security a
gainst too easy an introduction of them ; that this purpose
might well be effected without inhibiting the right to the indi
vidual states; that of course the naturalization granted under
the authority of Pennsylvania, conferred the right of citizen
ship, and that the complainant's bill mull be dismissed.
By far the greatest part of the oppofers of the new consti
tution have seen that their fears were groundless, and to their ]
great honor as citizens have cheerfully acquiesced in the ad
ministration of the government. It would be strange if some
few whose pafiions were inflamed by the dispute lhould not be
found as implacable as ever. The newspapers ftiew that the
attack on the government is renewed with more solemnity
and address than it was begun. Without pretending to fay
that these enemies of the government are in the wrong, it is
enough for a political enquirer to d'lfcern by their writings,
that they are enemies. Accordingly they mix cenfsres upon
the frame of the government, with their invectives against
men and measures. The people and these writers have very
different views; the former wish to have the constitution well
administered, the latter to make the resentment of the public
the means of its deftruftion. That the writers entertain these
views cannot be proved beyond contradiction ; lur ivho can
fee into the hearts of men?â But the complaints of these re
formers go far beyond the change of men and measures, and
they do not scruple to fay that the frame cf government itfelf
is defeaive and unfafe, Indeed, if the government is half as
bad as they defciibe it, they have some excuse for attempting
to subvert it.
423
The firft flep towards pulling tyranny down is to make the
multitude hate it. For us many, can overpower a tew, a pa
triot can be certain of beating the tyrant as soon as he can
combine the force of the many against himj accordingly, it has
been considered as worthy and laudable to inveigh agamft des
potism. But when the people set up government with their
own hands, it is absurd to attempt uniting the people against
government; why therefore some men Ihould preach about
republicanism, when tliey attempt to write down a lepublicuii
government, it is not easy to lay. Perhaps they remember
it was once popular to attack a foreign government, and tney
have not yet learned to conform their ideas to the nature of
the government they are 10 happy as to live under. Other
wise they would not sneer at the dutyâfor being a promise it
is a duty, of those who buoy up the government which the peo
ple have freely chosen.
Do persons usually tryto make others hate what tiiey Jove
themselves ? No ; writers who draw such vile [,i:tures of the
government, do not draw from the life, but their own disor
dered imaginations. They rave about monsters, becanfe they
are out of their wits, but the sober public cannot find them.
" The desire of public notice infatuates the mind of some
to that degree, that they prefer the censure and univerl'al re
prehension of mankind to being passed over in silence. The
idea of not being noticed is to them worse than non-existence,
and they would choose that their names Ihould be bandied
about by all clalTes of people, branded with infamy and dis
grace, rather than remain in oblivion.
" As the desire of diftinftion is universal, when one attempts
to force his way to it, others grow jealous, and take pleasure
in pulling him down, that they may raise their own upon the
ruins of their neighbour's character.
u Feeble indeed would be the guards of virtue, {lender the
fences that policy might ered: against transgression, did not
man feel a dread of that Being from whose eye not a spot in
the universe lies concealed, and who is a witness to every
thought and deed of his creatures. A belief in his superintend
ing providenceâthat he is the dete&or of the heart, and the
punifherof hidden wickedness, alone creates the faii<stity of
an oath, fixes the basis of virtue, and preserves inviolate the
laws ofjuftice. In all the casual modifications of political
life, religion is the foul of dutyâit forms the intrepid soldier,
the conscientious legislator, the faithful magistrate, and the
upright judge; it is the great basis of civil government and of
society. The subtle and unprincipled Machiavel himfelf
pays this compliment to the ancient Romans; u their reli
gion, fays he, produced good laws, and good laws their
GOOD FORTUNE."
A late London paper fays,â a Our continental dispatches
received last night, of authority unquestionable, l'peak decided
ly of a serious and immediate attempt to effe<st a Counter-Re
volution in France."âlt is added, that the King of Pruflia,
having refufed giving audience to Monf. Segur, the French
Ambaflador, he had left Berlin abruptly.
Last Monday week arrived at New-York, the {loop Maryann,
Capt. Sage, of Middletown, in 15 days from Port-au-Prince ;
who advises, that three days previous to his leaving that place,
about 600 troops, with a number of the inhabitants, made a
sally on the revolted negroes, by whom they were repulled,
with great {laughterâthat the inhabitants of Port-au-Prince,
were in the greatest consternation, expe&ing every moment a
general attack on the town.
