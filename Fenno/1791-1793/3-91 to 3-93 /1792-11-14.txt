PARIS, September 7.
AT three o'clock in the afternoon
of the fatal 2d of September, the
sanguinary mob reached the Temple,
where they were met by two of the
commifliuners from the National Af
fenibly. It was with great difficulty
they could be restrained from fur
ther aJis of violence ; they demand
ed the head of the Queen ; the cotn
niiflioners therefore to prevent a
greater mifchief, found it neceflary
to accompany them to the tower of
the Temple, one of their leaders car
rying on a pole the head of theprin
cefs de Lamballe.
The coinmillioners, attended by an
officer nf the National Guard, and
M. Palloi, the manager of the works
round the Temple", undertook to in
form th-e King and Queen of what
was traiifacting, and Thar the people
infilled on their viewing jfofara
cle they had brought. Trie heaJtfTi
the unfortunate vitftim was difplayedl
on their Majesties presenting them
selves at a window. The Queen, and
her daughter Madame Elizabeth, ac
cording to the report ofa violent Paris
print, displayed, for the firft time,
some fcnfibility ; and the King, who
obeyed without any hesitation, said
to one of thecommifiionersâ Sir. you
are right.
[We have noticed this remark, in
order ro (he - he base calumnies thai
are propagated concerning these Au
gust Personages. ]
When the mob went to the prison
de la Force, where the royal atten
dants were chiefly confined, the prin
cess de Laniballc went down on her
knees to implore a (ufpenfion of her
late for 24 hours. This was at firft
granted, until a second mob more fe
rocious than the firft, forced her
apartments, and decapitated her

centre of the allies. The son of the

" The nation that has long been the victim

The dilatory procedure of courts, the impuni

Idiftribi'tion of justice into their own hands.
T'e ille-al executions, but neceflary in the
pre r ent difaflrous circumftancesof the country,
seem to have produced some good effects. The
aristocrat, the haughty nobleman, the imperious
egotist have alike trembled, and were glad to
confide:' thamfelves as on a level with thole
true and good citizens, who till now had flood
abnoft: alone in the contest for liberty. But,
brethren and friends, fear ki.ows neither re

penly declared their anti-patriotic sentiments
or have shown themselves discontented with,
or even indifferent to, this our glorious .Revo
lution, tortured with removie, cannot endure
the glances of the friends of liberty : they dread
their juit resentment, and to avoid it can de
vise no better means than flight. Notwiths

doc, which, till 1789, rendered us large fnpplies,
as well as to Toulon and its vicinity, has ever
since been incapable of supplying its own de
mands : and there is no doubt but that they
must import for themselves this year. Burgun
dy and the Frarche Cumte do indeed promise a
large supply of beans, but their crops of wheat
are poor, and will prevent them exporting any
farther than Lyons.
" Advice? from Naples of t' e 4th current
(Aujuft) confirm the accounts of bad harvests
in those pa>ts, as well as in Sicilv, where the
exportation will not only be prohibited, but
they are about tc lay duties upon imported
coru. Instead therefore of being supplied from
that quarter, it is to be apprehended that they
themselves will ftaml in need. In such circum
ftatices, it is doubt left inoft prudent for us to
procure grain from more remote countries,and
our iinmedinte duty te take the rioft decided
measures to supply our own wants Ind those of
our neighbour : and to this object, the House
of Stephen Cathelan and Son, the latter ofwhom
is here in quality of Vite-Conful for the United
States of America, has turned its attention.
" Tift - House has been confVmtlv writing for
a yearpaft to its correspondents in America,
during all which time the pro'peft has been
very favorable for difpofmg both of corn and
flonr here to an advantage. Thev have like
wire written to Bourdeaux, to fevcral Spaniih
pots, particularly Cadiz, where their vefiels
are always ordered to flip to enquire what port
in the Mediterranean affords the be ft markets.
Notwithstanding all this, cargoes of the above
mentioned articles have not yet got farther on
towards us than Barcelona ; we hope, hqwev cr r
that from the inducements and additional en
couragements that nre daily held forth, a plen
tiful fupplv may vet lie had. The time, how
ever, from now till the 15th of December (the

our wants, offers emoluments to the adven

cannot be supplied during the present year, on
account of the indifferent crops, which are dis
proportionate to the quantities that Marfeil'es

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
SATUKDaY, Nov. to.
Mr. Hartley, of Pennsylvania, and
Mr. Sylvelter from New-York, took their

MONDAY, Nov. 12.
Mr. A Hie took his ft at this day.
By the nn tutes of S.ituriay'sproceedings read
this day, it appears that the committee appointed
to wait on the President of the United States, to
know at what time and place it would be con
venient for him to receive the address of the
House, in answer to his speech to both Houses,
imported that the President had appointed Mon

A communication was received and read from
theTreafury department, containing an account
of receipts and expenditures of public money to
the end of the year 1791.
The memorial of Joseph Warrington, refpec
fing a demand on the estate of the late Major

cause to be laid before the House an account of
the disbursements made by his department in
the years 1790, and 1791.
At 12 o'clock the Speaker accompanied by
the other members and preceded by the Ser
jeant at arms, waited on the President of the
United States with the following address in an
swer to his f )eech.
Sir,
Tht house of representatives, who al
ways feel a fatisfaftion in meeting you, are
ffuich concerned that the occasion for mu
tual felicitation afforded by the circum
ftjinces favoiable to the national prosperi
ty, (hould be abated by a continuance of
the hostile spirit of many of the Indian
tribes j and particularly that the reiterat
ed efforts for effecting a general paL Jilica
tion with them should have iflued in new
proofs of their persevering enmity, and the
barbarous facrifice of citizens, who, as
the of peace, weie diftinguifh
'"g thfemfelves by their zeal for the public
service.'
In our deliberations on this important
department of our affairs, we fiiail be dif
"ofed to purftie every measure that may
pe didiated by the fincereft desire, on one
and, of cultivating peace, and manlfeft
g by every practicable regulation, our
nevolent regard for the welfare of this
'â¢ fgb.ukd people ; and by the duty we
feel, on ilie other, to provide effec
tually for the fafety and protection of our
iellow-citiz:ns.
' ,ulc vvlt| i legrtt we learn that symp
toms of oppolitiou to the law impofnig
duties on fpuirs didilled within the Unit
ed States have inaiiiicded themselves, we
icfle& with confutation, that they are con
fined to a small portion of oui fellow-citi-
zens.
_ It is not more effcntial to the prcferva
tiÂ°n of true liberty that a government
(hould be always ready to lillen to the re
presentation ot its oonltituents, aiid to ac,
commodate its meafuies to the sentiments
and wishes of every par t of them, as saras
will con fill with the good of the whole
than it is that the jult authority of the laws
(hould be (tedfaitly maintained.
Under this imprtffion, every depart
ment of the government and all good
citizens mud approve the measures you
have taken, and the purpose you have
formed to execute this part of your trust,
with fiimnefs and energy ; and be allured
fir, of every constitutional aid and co
operation which may become requisite on
our part. And we hope that while the
progtefs of contentment under the law
in queftior. is as obvious, as it is rational,
no particular part of the community may
be permitted to withdraw from the gene
ral burthens of the country by a conduct
as irreconcileable to national justice as it
is inconfillent with public decency.
The productive Hate of the public re
venue, and the confirmation of the credit
of the United States abroad, evinced by
the loans it Antwerp, and Amfterda'm,
are communications the more gratifying,
as they enforce the obligation to enter on
fyftematif and effedlual arrangements for
discharging the public debt as fact as the
conditions ofit will permit ; and we take
pleasure in the opportunity to assure you
of our entire concurrence in the opinion,,
that no measure can be more definable,
whether viewed with an eye to the urgent
wi(h of the community, or the intrinsic
importance of promoting so happy a
change in our situation.
The adoption of a constitution for the
state of Kentucky is an event, in which
we join in all the fatisfa&ion you haveex
prefll-d. It may be considered as parti
cularly interfiling ; since, besides the im-;
mediate benefits resulting fiom it,it is ano
ther a'ufpicious demonstration of the faci
lity and success with which an enlighten
ed people is capable of providing, by free
and deliberate plans qf government, for
their own fafety and happiness.
The operation of the law eltabliftii ng
the poft-office, as it relates to the tranl-,
million of nevvf-papers, will mÂ«iit our
particular enquiry and attention. The
circulation of political intelligence
through these vehicles being justly reck
oned the surest means of preventing the
degeneracy of a fiee government, as well
as of recommtnding every salutary public
measure to the confidence and co-opera
tiori of all virtuous cirtizens-
The several other matters which you
have communicated and recommended,
will in their order receive the attention'
due to them. And our discussions will ia
all cases, we trust, be guided by a pro
per refpeft for harmony and ftabilily- in
the public councils, and a defite to con
ciliate more ar.d more the attachment of
our constituents to the constitution, by
meafutes accommodated to the true ends
for which it was eltablilhed.
To which address thÂ« President made the
following Reply.
Gentlemen,
IT gives me pleasure to express to you
the fatisfa&ion which your address affords
me.â I feci, as I ought, the approbation
you manifeft of the measures I have taken,
and the purpose I have formed, to main
tain, pursuant to the trust icpofcd in me
by the constitution, the refpedt which is
due to the laws, and the afiurance which
yon, at the fame time, give me of every
conliitutional aid and co-operation, that
may become requifitc on your part.
This Is a new proof of that enlightened
solicitude for the eftabli(hment and confir
mation of public order, which, embracing
a zealuus regard for the. principles of true
libei ty, has guided the deliberations of
the Ho life of Representatives; a persever
ance in which can alone secure, under the
divine blefiiog, the real and permanent fe
licity of our common country.

Philadelphia, Nov. 14.
Late accounts from South-Carolina inform, that
there is no doubt the ele&ors of that state will ge
nerally vote for Mr. Adams, as Vice-Prcfidcnt. A
weak attempt, it is said, has been made by a fifler
ilate, to create an antifederal interest in the back
country in tavor of Mr. tlinton, but that state is
too much attached to the tcdcial government to
placc in so high a ikjtion a pd son profeflTedly. hof
tiietoit, and who, fbould he be ele&ed, would
become the head ol a party tooverthraw it.
On Tuefdav, last week, Mr. Jones made a
motion in the Senate of New-York, for the pro
test of the minority of the canvairers, at the
lateeleftion, to be entered upon the minutes of
that house, but a meflage coming from the As- :
fembly at the instant prevented the confidera-;
tion of the motionâand
Thuridav Mr. Tillottfon moved that the en
try of Mr. Jones's producing a protest aga'mft
the determination of the major part of the joint
committee appointed to cativafs and estimate
the votes taken at the last election, be erased
from the journalsâdebates aro<e, and Mr. Pre
sident having put the question thereon, it was
carried in the negativeâNays 16âYeas 7.
In 1788 when it was moved in the Legiflatuie
of South-Carolina to call a Convent ion lor the
adoption of the federal government, a member,
who had been a Virginian, proposed that South-
Carolina (hould wait until lhe f.iw what (leps her
elder filler, Virginia, would pursue ; but this pro
portion was universally reprobated by the Legis
lature, arid it was immediately rcfolved that as the
people of South-Carolina could think and ast for
themlelves, a Convention (hould be called, with
out regard to the mea Cures of her elder filter. At
thai time a letter was received from the Governor
of Virginia, proposing a kind of league of the
Southern States againlt the new Government, but
it was taken no notice of.
A correspondent fays, that every patriotic
citizen mull be pleased at the conduct of the
Chief Magistrate of this Commonwealth, in re
gard to the unlawful combination in the western
counties against the law of the United States
for collefling a duty on distilled spiritsâ More
particularly as (it is said) he has taken these de
cifivc steps at the instance of the Prelident of
the United States.
A con,efpom 4 ent observes, that (hould Mr.
Adams not have a large majority of the luffrages of
the ele&ors for Vice-President, it will confirm the
truth of the ingratitude of republics. When the
great, eminent, and long continued exertion's and
fcrvices of that virtuous itatefmari are remember
ed, can Americans requite them by a difinifTal
from an honorable station ? Forbid rt, Pairioti Jin.

The partisans ol faction have frequently cem~

a representative government: The purity of
their lentiinents on this ellential principle of
lepublicanifin may well be lulpeaed, as they
are now exerting every method to vitiate til t
only lource of legitimate authority ; sensible
that the people, unhiaffed and unprejudiced,
will elect and re elect their bell men, their tri
ed and uucoirupted patriots, this party have
lor a long time been indefatigable in difTemi
nating the most peltiient poilor, principles and
lies among the electors ; and men who ilood ai
firm as pillars of adamant,in the darkest hour?
our country ever (aw, have been represented as
conspirators against: the public liberty, because
they happen to be in office through the free and
unbialTed choice of their fellow-citizens !
It was the necefl'ary effc-ft of the funding sys
tem that the public creditors lhould be beiii
fited thereby ; and the circumstances of every
man in the country are rendered more eligible
by the operation of the government of the Uni
ted Stater,; so that after alljthe sophistical de
clamation against both, the greatest grievance
to their enemies is, that they enforce the prin
ciples of justice, public and private.
I Public and private justice are the only bafu
'ofgeneral confidenceâand it ought to be se
riously considered bv the citizens of the United
Stares, what will probably be the consequence
ill a very short time of throwing an odium 011
the measures which have wrought fj favorable

GEOGRAPHY.
Mathew Carey
Refpe&fully submits to the Citizens of the United
States, the following
PROPOSALS
TOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION,
An AMERICAN EDITION of
Guthrie's Geography
IMPROVED
OJ which these are the terns :
1. TT (hall be published in 48 weekly numbers,
A each containing three Iheets.or tweiKy-four
pages, of letter press, in quarto, printed with new
types on fine paper.
11. In the course of the work will be delivered
about thirty large maps, of the fame fire as those
in the European editions, viz. most of them sheet
maps on post paper.
$3T Bejidei f\maps in the Britijh editions, this
work will contain maps of as many of the United Stiles
as can be readily procured, executed by the btjl engrav
ers in the United States,
111. The price ot each number will be a quar.
ter dollar, to be paid on delivery. No ad
vance required.
IV. The work will be put to press as (oon as
700 copies are fubferibed for.
V. Sublcribets who disapprove of the work, on
the publication of the three firft numbers, are to
be at liberty to return them, and (hall have their
money repaid.
VI. The fubferibers' names (hall be prefixed as
patrons of the undertaking.
Perhaps there is no science more entertainino
and ufeful than geography. It reveals the disco
veries of travellersâthe remarkable cunofities of
all countries, in nature and artâthe filiation o(
orovinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, & moun
tainsâin fine, the tiiflory, manners, cuftoins, laws,
forces, revenues, and government of different na-
tions.
It is an old observation, that " there is not a
son or daughter of Adam, but has some concern
with geography," and that a knowledge of this
fcicnce is indispensable towards the study of liif.
Tory with advantage or fatisfa&ion. Indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannot discourse on the
most common newspaper topics of the day without
betraying his ignorance.
So much for geographv generally. With re
foeft to the present plan, let it fuffice to remark,
ihat Guthrie's Geography hat. been long acknow
ledged to be the best in the Engiifh language :
however, the account of America in it ha-., from
obvious reasons, been very erroneous and defec
tive. The errors of former editions will be cor
rected, and the defers supplied, by gentlemen o!
abilities, who have engaged to fupennfend this
undertaking, and to avail themselves of all the irv
formation that can be procured, to render it the;
most complete edition extant.
The Printer carneftly solicits the support of hiJ
fellow-citizens throughout the United States : and'
as no deposit is required, and every fubferiber will'
beat liberty to withdraw his name, if, on trial,
he should disapprove of the work, he hopes the
friends of fcicnce. and of American arts and ma
nufactures, will cheerfully and early patronize this
â¢jfcfnl work, the greatest and most exprnfive, pro
bably, ever yet attempted in America, in the typo
graphical line, the Encyclopaedia excepted.
