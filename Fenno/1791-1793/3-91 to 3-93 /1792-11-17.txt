THE combination formed againfl
France, is every day becoming
niore formidable. AH the advices
from Germany, Spain, and .Sardinia,
agree irr the accounts they give of the
expensive preparations which are
carryingon againlt us. The King of
Great-Britain, in his German charac
ter of EJet'tor of Hanover, has not
merely avowed his intentions of ta
king part with the two great Courts,
but has been molt conspicuous and
forward in f"g'lgi"g others to co
aiefce. Mis Hanoverian minister, as
yon will fee officially notified to the
Atfembly, has travelled over Germa
ny, to make converts to the canfe of,
the Princes. The King of Spain hasj
thrown ofF the fiimfj difgoife of neu-i
trality, and afl'uiediy declared iiiin-i
felffor hostilities. Sardinia, at the'
fame tints, has no longer occasion for
jefuiiifin, but threatens determined
war.
We have the omens of new m a fia
cres in Paris. Thehellifh Katftion of
Iloberfpierre, Marar, Chabor, and o
ihers, bave actually been insinuating,
that the prisons are again loaded with
fufpetfted persons. Ihe minister of
jnftice has found, that since the mas
sacre, between four and five hundred
persons have been imprisoned in Pa
ris by the municipality, the feiftions,
and individuals ; lb trie of them npon
crimes alledged, but most of them on
mere undefcibed suspicion. The
Alfembly knowing well that the in
liquations of these ruffians are signals
for execution, have taken ineafures to
save these poor wretches from the fu
ry of the mob.
" Citizens ! be on your guard ;
keep a watchful eye over thel'e trai
tors : let us refrain from every kind
of exctSs ; let ns refpetft persons and
property : let 11s maintain good or
der ; war againtt tyrants, and union
among onrfeives ; let Paris be the
cradle of liberty ; let it also be a fafe
and lure asylum ; (uffer the inha
bitants to remain in it ; f uffer Gran
gers also to vifir it ; the poor will
then be able to live ; commerce will
flourifti ; abundance will return ; and
Paris will become the fir It city in the
world."
September 19.
By letters received Tuesday and
Wednesday lull, we learn, thar du
ring the night of Sunday and Mon
day lall, the mob here broke open
the jewel-office belonging to the
Crown, and Hole out of it all the
jewellery and regnlia.
The treasure depoflred in this
J>lace, csimprjfing diamonds and o
ther precious (tones, the rich pre
sents made by sovereign Princes, See.
was by far more valuable than thai
belonging to any other crowned head
ill Europe. The total value of the
diamonds, pearls, coloured (tones,
and diamond ornaments of the King's
dress alone, is estimated about one
million tterling.
Monf. Merlin, member of rhe com
mittee of refearclies, has given the
following account of the robbery :
At ten at night a patrole of the
feJiion of the Thnilleries perceived
a man who was defcendhig the lamp
pott of the jewellery office. On leiz
i"f, him, iiis pockets were found full
of jewels, diamonds, gold and silver.
Another robber, in attempting to cf
cape by throwing himfelf from the
top of oneuf the pillars, was wound
ed in the head and taken ; he was
covered wiih brilliants, and had a
handkerchief full of gold and silver,
diamonds, (apphires, enterals and to
pazes. lhe National nfiembly has
thij morning named four of its mem
bers to be prcfent at the information
of ihij sfluir, Two cotifiderable dia
nioncis, orie nained the Regent, wpnh
500,0C0i. ItcÂ»ling, and the "wuci, sic
carried ofF, with nil the mott pre
ciolis billibitls. 1 lie value is eiti
mated at several millions flerling.
In confecjuence of this depredation,
an older was iiined mftantly to ihut
the barriers, and I'earch every per
lon who attempted to pal's. At the
(atue time couriers were dispatched
on every road leading fioni the ca
pital, with orders to iiop every car
riage they met.
Decree of the Poiflonniere.
The following will (hew our readers
the respect entertained for the
scriptures by Some of the Parisians.
A letter having been read from the!
reAor of St. Laurent, inviting the
aflembly of that fedion to the
funeral service performed in honor
of our brethren, who f ell on the 10th
of A tig 11 ft last. the aflembly, persuad
ed that it is at length time to speak
the language of reaf'on, decreed the
following answer :
The martyrs of liberty, our brave
brethren, who fell on the ioth of
August, have no need of being excus
ed or recommended toajutt, good,
and merciful God ; the blood which
they have thed for their country ef
faces all their faults, and gives them
aclaim to the beneficence of the Deity.
What ! shall we go and offer our
prayers to the Divinity that he may
not condemn our brethren to the pÂ»-
nifhment of eternal fire ! This would
be offering an insult to him, it would
be telling him that he is the mofl fe
rocious, the molt absurd, and the
most: ridiculous of all beings. God,
Sir, is jufl ; our brethren consequent
ly enjoy a perfect happinels, which
nothing can e'eftroy : bad citizens]
alone can doubt it.
Shew ns upon your altar pieces the
glorious victims of liberty, crowned
with flowers and occupying the place
of Sr. Crispin and Sr. Evinlin.
Substitute songs of liberty for the
abi'urd hymns afciibed to that feroci
ous David ; that crowned monlter ;
that Nero of the Hebrews, whose least
crime was his having aflaiiinated a
huiband, in order that he might sleep
more conveniently with his wife.
We (hall then unite with you in cele
brating together that God who im
printed 011 the heart of man instinct
which excites in hiin the love of li
berty.

Firing at the King of Pruflia,

LYONS, September 1 3
In imitation of the example set t>y
the Parisians, the prisons in this city
were forced open, and the pril'oners,
tliotgh defended by the Municipal,
Officers, were all slaughtered indif-1
criminately; nothing could exceed
i he ?ury of the populace, and ihe ef
fetffs it produced are too (hocking to
relate ; several heads were carried
through the ftreers. One of the pii
foners liad escaped from his murder
ers, and came to the Hall of ihe Ma
gistrates to implore protection j but
' veil h'.. Judges couM rot save him
from the monsters vvho were in pur
fiiit of him, and who cut him in pie
ces, with several more unfortunate
citizens and prisoners, in the very
presence of the officers of jultice.
At night the bloody scenes increas
edâevery moment the prisons were
opened â a great number of priests
were murderedâone ef them was
disguised in woman's cloaths : the
llaughter did not cease till the streets
were covered with dead bodies.
An infurreiftiou has also taken
place at St Martin near Lyons; 4'e
ven persons, among whom were four
priests, were saved from being mas
sacred by a party of National Guards.
BRUSSELS, September 22.
After the events of the 14th inft.
the news of which you probably have
lifeard, the armies under the com
mand of the Duke of Brunfwick, hav
ing turned the mountains of Cler
montois, found the armies of Luck
ner, Dumourier, and Kellerman, ve
ry advantageously ported in a chain
of mountains parallel to the river of
Ainfe.
The combined armies offered bat
tle to the French, which they refill
ed. It then became neceflary to turn
a corps of 20,000 men under M. Dn
mourier, who occupied a hcighth
which is considered as a key to ihe
pafles. The intrepidity ofthetroops
conquered all obstacles ; they attack
ed and took a battery of cannon, and
M. Dumourier perceiving they ftiould
turn his flank took flight. The two
other Generals followed his example,
and the French army palled the Ain
fe in the greatest diforder,'and. fled
towards Chalons, where it is thought
they did not flap
In this retreat, from four to five
lundred prifoneis have been made,
md they loft a great number of peo
)le, four pieces of cannon, sixty wag
jons, and an infiniteqtiantity of bag-
? a S e -
JVI. de Sombrneil, aid de camp of
the Prince of Nallau, has gained great
credit in this acftion by his valour and
intelligence. It is umlerftood, that
the king of Prussia decorated hiin
vvith the military orders 011 the field
of battle.
All the difficult paff'ages are now
forced, and the combined armies have
the key to Paris, except the battle
which t he patriots at e to in the
plains of Champagne, behind Cha
lons; but it is feared their courage
will not await the Auftrians and
PrnlTians

Official letteison the retreatof the
French army to the camp of Daili-

" In our retreat to the camp of
Dammarrin, two leagues from St.
Meneliould, the rear-guard of onr
army was vigorously charged ; but
the body of our army had got to the
camp in the bed order, and was. even
already encamped ; on a sudden,
some ill-intentioned persons spread
the alarm, by announcing that the
rear-guard liad been cur to pieces,
and enemies were falling in great
force on the main body of the army.
The waggon drivers increased the
terror by being firft to take the alarm.
The confufion wasfuch, that jco men
might easily have routed the hnlf of
the army.â !n the mean while the
General beinginformed of this event,
went out to meet the army. He found
the cavalry in the best order at his

A correspondent observes, that there must be
some mistake in the paragraph which the
carting vote of the Vice-President on the Rcprc
femation Bill, as the cause of the oppofitioo in the
state of Virginia, to the re-cleft ion of that gentle
man. It is well known that the Vice-Prefiiicm is
in favor of a large and equal reprefeutationâhis
vote against the r-uio of 30,000, was therefore pro
bably on the idea that luch a ratio would encreafc
the inequality resulting from the operation of an
unequal principle in the bi)l--but it would be
highly derogatory to the honor of any flaie in the
Union, 10 thro Wan odium on a member of a le
gislative body, for exercifniq the fiift principle o!
repubhcanifm in a free independent voteâthere

Mr. W. Smith lupported the relolridon. He
Ihewed by the report iti'elf, and from the rea
lor.iiig uled by geutlemtn in opposition to the
resolution, tnat the two secretaries were impli
cated ill the caul'es of the failure of the expediti
ng { ro in hence he inferred the julbice and pro
priety ot giving them an opportunity of excul
pating theitilelycÃ.
Mr- Gerry exprefled surprize at the apprehen
sion which lonic gentlemen appear to entertain
of the :n; alt. If ox introducing the heads of de
partment into the nouie; for his part he had
â ho such appreheufious. The secretary will at
tend at the orders of the house, luureiy to give
Inch information as may be retired, and not as
members or miiiiflers, to influence and govern
â the determinations ot the house.
Mr. Venable objected further to -he resoluti

heads of departments coming forward, ar.d at
tempting 111 any way to influence the delibera

Mr. lanvrance replit d to Mr. Venabie ; he
abferved that the gentleman appeared to mil

fempUted that Either of the iecretaries should
appear on the floor of the house, to influence,

Mr. Murray objedted to the resolution. The
report, he observed, is made to the houseâis in
the course of its difcuilion any futther light or
information ihould be deemed neceifary, it may
then be cailedfor, and in that mode which lhall
appear moil eligibleâat prcfent the question ap

IVednefday, November 14.
Sketch of the Debate on the metion for recommitting
the Report.
Mr. Madison fuggeited that the most simple,
apd confident plan would be,
;o recommit the report of the Sele& Commit
tec, and refer the preleat application;>* to the
Committee, to whom the report&all be re-com
mitted âHe therefore moved that the Commit
tee of the whole ihould he dtfeharged from con
sidering the report on the eaules of the failure
of the late expedition.âMr. Smith (S. C.) ob
served that fevera! ohje&ions {truck him in op
pofttioa tp this motion. The House must at
some period laid he, meet this buiinefs ; if it is
recommitted, here will be an impropriety in re
ferring it to the fain Committee, if a new Com
mittee is appointed they mull begin the whole
bu/inefs de novo; and if their in veil i gat ion
should take, up such a length time as that of
the lormer committee the i'elfion will be expen
ded; and at the close of it, the business will recur
on the house, and tfie fame difcufiVon will be to
be had, that is now proposedâHe hoped the
house would therefore proceed in the considera
tion of the report, aflign two or three days in
the week for the purpofc, and continue the in
vestigation till the whole is finifhed.
Mr. Giles replied, that he had no doubt that
the vouchers on which the committee had foun
ded the report would appear fuffiÂ«ient to juftify
the decifioxis that they had made. He laid, that
he did not fuppole that the applicants would ad
duce any new informationâone of them had
been called on, he attended the committee, and
he supposed that he had furniftied all the infor
mation he was in possession of. He obje&ed to a
re-commitment, as one of the committee he was
perfectly iatisfted with the report; nor did he
conceive there was any additional evidence to be
produced, except it was of a recent date.
Mr. Ames said, he perceived such a difineb-na
tion to go into the business as indicated a pro
per temper oi mind in relation to the perions
fuppoled to be any ways interefleri in the ulti
mate decilicn of the lioufc He was opposed to
* recommitment; as it would procrastinate, in
Itead ot expediting the enquiry. He adverted
to the report.âFa els are ftatcd, the public have
been left to draw the inferences, tlie committee
have not explicitly criminated any body; but
ttiey have determined, in feverai instances, who

to get through the bufincftin a (horter time tl.au
a ieleJt committee. He added several other rea
sons which induced him to be in favour of the
houie proceeding with the report.
Mr. Gerry said it appeared to him that the
only qneftion leemed to be, whether the houfc
or thfleled committee lhall efUblift the fails?

T"u n 1 5*, ve c l ual as if they were
eftaWilhed by the house? He < onceived it would
not; but should the result be acormftmn on the
part of the house, that some of the officers arc
culpable, will the house reft an impeachment on
the report of the committee ? He conceived the
house ought to found their decisions on fads as
certained by themselves. It has been laid there
is no diiference between the house and the com
mittee : If this is the cafe, does it not imply a
cerafurc by the house on certain fhara&ers? He
thought it did. It therefore becomes the house
to difcufc the report that it may be determined
on what footing it Hands. If, in the cafe of a con
tested ele<sUon the house revolted from the idea
of Submitting their judgment to fa&s fubflanti
ated by a committee, the cafe before us is of
unlpeakably greater magnitude, for thel'e and se
veral other reasons he hoped the report would
not be recommitted,
Mr. Williamfon was in favour of the motion
for recommitting ; he supported his opinion by
the uniform pra&ice of the houfc, which in eve
ry cafe where new evidence was adduced, always
provided that the new evidence should be exa
mined by the fame committee, who had original
ly brought in the report. He said if this mode
was departed from, we should find no commit
tee would bring forward a state of fa&s in fu- j
He thought it was not treating the com
mittee with proper candor to decide on their re
port in its present situation.
ture.
Mr. Sylvester observed, that the resolution
of the house at the close of the last session, that
they would take up the business early in the pre
fcut session, precluded a recommitmentâhe was
therefore oppoled to the motion.
Mr. Boudinot w?.s in favour of a recommit
ment, he said, if there is new evidence to be
brought forward, the house ought to wait fill
that is received and reported at the Clerk's ta
ble ; ami this he conceived ought to be done in
the usual way, by a feletSfc committee; till the
whole testimony i? completed it appeared to him
the house was not prepared to take one step in
the business.
Mr. Madison replied to Mr. Gerry's allusion
to the cafe of the contested ele&ion. He enqui
red of him whether the house itfelf went into
an investigation of fa&s in the firft inftamx ?
believed he would not fay thst tliey did.
With refpedt to the memorials, he enquired,
whether, if they had been presented at the time
of the investigation of the fubje& by ths felecft
committee, they would not have been referred
to rhe committee; if they would then have been
thus referred, the fame reason exists for referring
them to a fele& committee at theprefent time.
Mr. liawrance was of opinion, that a re-com
mitment wouM tend to a saving of time; the
committee will not he obliged to go over the
fame ground agjiin that has already been explo
redâall they wiil be obliged to do is, to invef
tigatc the new testimony which will be adduced.
He hoped therefore, that the motion would pre
vail.
Mr. Giles said, that the proceedings of the
committee were public, and that the secretaries
could have attended all the time, had they fecn
properâThey attended but once, and then ap
peared extremely anxious to get away, to attend
to their offices. The committee would have been
extremely glad to have had thofc gentlemen pre
sent oftener, and to receive all the information
they could giveâand supposed they had done it.
Mr. Gerry replied to Mr. Madison; he said,
if gentlemen would recur to the proceedings of
the house on the contested ele&ion, they will
find, that the house expressly reserved to itfelf
the rights of fubilanriating the faÂ£s, which
should appear from an examination of the de
positions, taken in conformity t* the resolutions
of the house; and here he adverted to the mode
pointed out by the house in taking thole depo
lition.n. The adverse party was to be summoned
to attend to the taking them ; but in this re
port it appears, that exparte evidence has been
admitted as the foundation on which some of
the decifjons have been made.
Mr. Murray lupported the motioij for a re
commitment. Heobferved, that the business in
its present (late was so incomplete, that he
could not fee how the house could proceed upon
it. One part of the evidence only is finifhed,
Mid the report is made on that evidence. Now,
we are told, new testimony is offered; let the
whole be brought into view at once, and then
the house will be in a situation to judge.
Mr. Page was in favor of a further comriiit
mentor the buiinefs; but whether to the com
mittee who made the rej o t, or to a new com
mittee, he lhould not take upon him to fay.
With refpedt to the admiflion of any head of a
department to the bar of this houi'e, except in
caie of an impearhment, he would never confe'.it
to it It would be a precedent of a most dan
gerous nature, tending to a deftrudHon of all
freedom of (inquiry by committees.
Mr. Findley observed, that the committee
wiflied tbi>t Mr. Hodgdon fhouldhave been pre-,
lent, but he did not make his appearance; the
committee therefore proceeded on the testimony
they had, and as there is now new evidence
brought forward, he thought it was proper that
the report ftould be recommitted. An one of the

Steele remarked on the want of candor towards
,the committee, which had been (hewn by some
ot the members in thecourfe of their observati

pcx-nig ex parte evidence,and observed that with
itlpcft to the Secretary of War, it was not true
t nat the committee had proceeded on exparte

by the delays of the committee from the recruit

Mr. Steele then concluded by some addition
rerr*arks on the indelicacy manifefted by some
gentlemen in their treatment of the committee,
and obierved that he did not apply it ro himfelf
peiionally, but as it refpedted the Committee at
large he thought proper to express the contempt
whiclt he conceived it merited.
Mr. Dayton replied to Mr. Steele, he repeat
ed the ftibftance of his original remarks on the
report, and added that in the courfc of the dif
cufljon he should attempt to shew that the de
duitions madein several parts of the report were
falfe.
Mj. D 1 yton added, that whatever ;he gentle

SIR,
After the close of die lafl femon of
Coagrefs, I saw with much concern the
: rÂ¥poAof the cominittee appoiuted to en
quire 'into the causes of the failur'e of the
expedition under-Major Get). St. Clair, of
tfec Bth of May, 1792, which having been
prefeiited to the house in thelaft moments
of the session, was ordered Â»o be printed
and has since circulated in the public
newspapers throughout the United States,
containing fuggeitions molt of them foun
ded upon ex parte invelliVation, which
have been underltood in a icufe very iuju
rions to my reputation-.
Learning that the prefentday was ap
pointed for taking into corifideration the
above-mentioned reportâl luvr waited
with anxious expectation for fouie act oi
the houte enabling me to attend the piu
grcio of the examination upon which iney
are about to enter, for the purpose of fur
nithing such information and explanation*
as might conduce to a right underlUud
ing ot lacls, in which I am to materially
implicatedâThe failure of a pvopoGtioi
which I am informed was nude to i,io
house with that view, has auded to my li>
licitnde and regret.
I'll us lituated, I feel njyfelf called uj
on to alk of the justice of the houle that
some mode may be deviled, by whicn ii.
will be put into my power to be pttient
during the course of the intended liiquny,
as well to hear the evidence oil which the
several allegations contained in the report
are founded, as to offer the information
and explanations to which I have alluded.

To the Charge of the Chief Justice,
delivered to the Grand Jury of the City
and County oj Philadelphia on Tucfday

r rHE Gtaiul Jury of the city and
A county of Philadelphia, beg
leave to return their thanks to the

delivered 10 i lieui at Lhe opening of
thepre'ent Icliions of Oyer and I er

do iiiicerely participate in the pain
exprellctl by your honor on account
of t he late illegal combination among
some of our western brethren, to op
pose the law of the United States fur
railing a revenue 011 diltilled spirits.
It is matter of great concern to us,
that an event l'o prejudicial to the
public happiness, and so inconfillent
with an enlightened attachment to
liberty and law, (hould haveoccnrred
in a Rate of which we are citizens,
and which is so deeply intereded by
its internal and local circumstances
steadily to maintain public order.â
Antid(bthÂ«fÂ« painful sensations, how
ever, we beg leave to aflure the ho
norable couit, that we have not failed
to exercise our vigilance and zeal in
making diligent enquiry of all Inch
offences as may have been committed
within our jurifdidiion ; and are hap
py to affiire you that we have fofind
none of the nature referred to in the
proclamation of the President of the
United' States ; whose upright and
mild, but efficient adminilhation of
conltitution and laws,
we vÃll ever strenuously support, both
in our public and private capacities.
We beg leave to request a copy of
that part of your charge which re
lates to the President's proclamation
for publication, being fully imprefl'ed
that the fentinients contained in ir,
will meet the entire approbation of
every good citizen.

Hon. Thos. M'Kean, Esq. Chief
Justice of the State ps Pennsylvania,
The proceedings of the National
Aflembly and the Community of Pa
ris, at the fame time that they dilplay
great enthufiafin, exhibit such strong
fyinptoms of apprehension as mult
create dismay and alarm in the other
parts of France, and increase the
confidence of the enemy. Their de
crees bear the molt evident marks of
precipitancy and want of system, and
seem to arise on the fpurof the occa
sion, without previous arrangement
or forefight. To oppose, with effect,
so powerful a confederacy, as that
which now invades France, theie
fliould be a well organized system of
defence,an energetic executive power,
and a numerous and well disciplined
army, acting under one head, and
well (applied with arms,ammunition,
clothing, forage, tents and other mi
litary apparatus. Patrioiifm is a good
thing, but it cannot prevail without
ihefe cflerniaU. Mail.

that he never did pay or fend any Jum to thi

THE great importance oi the Holy Scriptures,
I intercf; ?ng to every individual ; :he divine exce!-
I Icnre of its doctrines and precepts, and the beauty
and (Ã¼blimiry of its pafLges, have so long made it
i capital o&jeÂ£t of attention, as to prccludc occa
sion or opportunity for eulogium.
The piety or enterori/e of individuals has pre
sented t his invaluable book to ihc public in a va
j nety of forms ; in fotne editions it has been highly
embellished with superb engravings, which have
greatly enhanced its price; in others it has been
accompanied with voluminous commentaries
wh>ch necelTarily encreafed the size; while a va
riety of plain cheap copies have generally difTufed
the knowledge of the Scripture, and made the
purchase easy to every elafs.
Without wishing in ihe (mailed degree to lessen
the merits of the various editions, whether plain
or ornamented, which the public are already in
pofTeflion of, !t is pertinent to remark, that very
many readers-os tafie and judgment have exprefTed
a wish for a Family Bible unencumbered with ad
ditions. There 'ftiH appeats room for another
edition on a beautiful new type, superior in
and elegance to any bible that has yet been printed

adventitious cirriimftances (if ornament or com
