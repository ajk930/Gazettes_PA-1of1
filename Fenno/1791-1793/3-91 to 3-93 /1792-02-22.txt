NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF FRANCE
NOVEMBER 17.
AVIGNON.
THE minister of the home department pro
duced difparches, which the comniiflioners
of the king employed for the purpose of reflor
ing the tranquillity of Avignon, had addrel'ed
to him by nn extraordinary courier.
They announce, ' that their endeavours had
succeeded to the fatisfartion of the unfortunate
inhabitants, whom the ruffians of the army of
Monteox, called Patriot, had pillaged and mafia
cred with impunity. The French troops are in
pofT'effinii of Carpentras and Avignon, to thegreat
diCpleafure of these ruffians. Those who had
fled f'm consternation now return to their
liomes. One Lecuyer had pillaged the inhabi
tants of Avignon ; he was mafTacred. His friends
took oicafioti to ravage the town, and under the
pretext of avenging his death, killed all tlieper
fons of probity whom they detested.
" They plunged them into the prisons of the
palace, and there mnflacred them in cold blood.
Sons were murdered in the prefenee of their fa
thers! mothers expired on the bodies of their
sons ! nlns ! <11 perished miserably !-â[The aflem
bly ftiuddered with horror; shrieks were utter
ed, expressive of the deepefl concern. J
" Barbarity spared not even the bodies of the
unfortunate vitftims :âthey were beheaded, cut
in pieces ; â the bodies of women were embow
elled ! the mangled remainsâ("Here, M. MOll
- could proceed no farther, his frame wascon
v til fed, the paper dropt from his hands, he co
-vered his face, and fled with precipitation from
the tribune. His flight was behind in a gloomy
silence : of so numerous an aflembly not oneper
fon was found, whose curiosity had so far maf
rered his feelings as to oppose his departure, or
demand his return.]
After a panfe of horror, M. lfnard, the fecre
rary, was ordered to proceed with the recital.â
" These mangled remains of their fury were
thrown into a ditch, colled Glaciere du Palais :
the entrance was closed up ; we discovered this
tomb, and caused it to be opened. A putrid
flench rendered it aJmoft inaccessible ; we, how
ever, caused it to be examined with proper pre
cautions, in order, if possible, by the number of
heads, to discover how many lives had been loft.
[The aflembly resounded with a mingled excla
mation of indignation and sorrow.]
" A crowd of unfortunate citizens came every
day to embrace our knees, and demand of us
their fathers, husbands, children and friends,
whose bodies were among the numberof thelixty
â virtims butchered at the caflle.
" It appeared to us indispensable to cause to
be arretted all the persons concerned in autho
rity at Av.gnon at the period of the mafl'acre :
the Sieurs Jourdan and Tonrnel are arretted;
the firtt was distant a league from Avignon, the
other attempted to fly, after discharging a pirtol
at the officer who was going to seize him ; he at
firtt Caved hi in (el f by clambering along the roofs,
but fell, and having a leg broken, was taken.
"We arrelfed the young Lecuyer, who, in
cited by an in Pitiable thirtt of blood, in order to
avenge his father, maflacred sixteen priioneis of
the palace.
" All these fa<fts have been authenticated : the
national afiembly, perhaps, regret having heard
at its bar, an emillary of the ruffians, who had
the audacity to acctife Mr. Mulot, the coininif
fioner of pacification. We are," &c.
The aflembly referred these dispatches to the
committee of legislation.
LONDON, December 7.
Amongst other lingular properties of charcoal,
It has lately been discovered by a gentleman at
i^eterfburgh, that all forts of glass velfels and
other utensils may be purified from long retain
ed fmehs and taints of every kind, in the eafiefl
and most perfecft manner, by rincing them well

The exhibition of legs in Mrs. Cowley's Co
medy, reminds us of a bon mot of George Sel
wyn's, who, on being asked how he liked the

it extremely well, and did not care to what
height the fafhion was carried !
Scottish plaids, to be used as furtouts, are be

apprehended.

It is a dark shade, something between a Coqueli

44 To virtue and to wisdom dear,
44 In words as lading as this earthly frame,

44 Go, Hero ol undaunted mind,
44 Goâleave thy rural enres behind ;
44 With all thy (kill and force oppose
44 Thy country's fierce, ambitious foes,
44 And from the threaten'd ruin save my land."
44 Scarce had your Guardian spoke the word,
44 When o'er his shoulder hung the sword ;
44 And to the field, with eager haste,
" To meet your Foe, the Hero pafs'd.
44 There horrid stood the British god of war,
'â¢ A lion dreadful rose upon his ihield ;
44 His head was cover'd with a blazing star ;
44 In aÂ£t to fttike a flaming spear he held.
14 No terror toueb'd the god-like Hero's breast;
44 He rulh'd impetuous on the furious foe,

44 Wound follow'd wound, 'till overcome with toil
44 The Foe retn'd; still on the Hero prefs'd,
44 And (buck the blow that fore'd him from your foil.
44 Curs'd be the hour (the raging warrior said)

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
FRIDAY, February 3, 1792.
hi committee of the whole, on the Fijhcry Bill.
[CON TINU ED.J
MR. A M ES,
AFTER some introdu&ory obfervations,adverted to the necef
litv of fixing some point in which both fides would agree.
Dilputes he said, could not be terminated, or more properly, they
could not be managed at all if some firft principles were not con
ccded. The parties would want weapons for the controversy.
Law is in some countries the yoke of government, which bends
or breaks the necks of the peopleâbut thank heaven, in this coun
try it is a man's shield ; his coat of mail, his castle of fafety ; 'tis
more than his defenceâ'tis his weapon to punifti ihofe wtio in
vade his rightsâ'tis the instrument which assistsâ'tis the pricc
that rewards his industry.
If I fay that fifhermen have equal rights with other men, every
gentleman feels in his own bosom a principle of afTent ; If I fay
that no man shall pay a tax on fending his property out of the
country, the conftituiion will confirm it ; for the constitution fays
no duty Jhall be laid on exports : If I fay, that on exporting dried
fifli, the exporter is entitled to drawback the duty paid on the
fait, I fay no more than the law of the land has confirmed..
Plain and short as these principles are, they include the whole
contioverfy : For I consider the law allowing the drawback as
the right of the fifhery ; the defe&s of that law as the wrong fuf
fered, and the bill before us as the remedy.
The defeats of the law are many and grievous. Dollars.
Supposing 340,000 quintals exported, the fait duty is 42,744
The drawback is only ... 34,000
Lois to the fifhery,
Whereas government pays
at 132 cents including charges, which are 3! cents on a
quintal : Which is beyond what the fifhery receives 11,900
And a clear loss to government of - - o,i^6
So that though the whole is intended for the benefit of the fiih
ery, about one fourth of what is paid is not so applied : there is
an heavy loss both to government and the filhery.
Even what is paid on the expoi tis nearly loft money; the boun
ty is not paid till the exportationânor then till fix months have
elapfcd : Whereas the duty on fait is paid before the filh is taken;
it is paid to the exporter, not to the fifherman. The bounty is
so indirefl that the poor fifherman loses fight of it. It is paid to
such perform, in such places, and at such periods, as to disappoint
its good effe&sâpalling through so many hands, and paying so
many profits to each, it is almost absorbed. The encouragement
too is grrateft in fuccefsful years when lealt neededâand is lcaft
in bad fifhing seasons when tis molt needed.
It is a very perplexed cmbairafling regulation to the officers of
government and to the exporter âhence the gteat charge; and with
all tins charge and irouble it is liable to many frauds. 400 miles
bf coastâ little towns, no officer.
All thefc defeÂ£U the bill remediesâand besides, gives the mo
ney on condition that certain regulations are submitted to, which
arc worth almoO as much as the money.
The bill is defended on three groundsâlft it will promote the
national wealth â2d the national latelyâ3d justice requires it ;
the last is fully relieH on.
To shew that the filhery will increase the wealth of the nation,
it cannot be improper to mention its great value.
&Uso
ULI.IN.

45.9Â°Â°The export before the war, brought more than a million of
dollars into this country ; probably it is not less at present, and
no small part in gold and silver : It is computed that 30,000 per
sons, including 4,000 seamen subsist by it. Many fay very corn
pofedly, if it will not maintain itfelf let it fall. But we should
not only lose the annuaT million of dollars which it brings us ; an
immense capital would be loft. The fithing towns are built on
the naked rocks or barren sands on the fide of the sea. Those
spots however, where trade would sicken and die, which hus
bandry scorns to till, and which nature seems to have devoted to
eternal bJJrrennefs, are feletted by industry to woik miracles on :
Houses, stores and wharves are ercfted. and a vafl property crea
ted âall depending on this bufinefs.âBefore you think it a light
thing to consign them to ruin, fee if you can compute what they
eoft ;if they outrun your figures, then confefs that'it would be
bad economy as well as bad policy to fufter rival nations to rum
our fifherv.
The regulations of foreign nations tend to bringthis ruin aboutj;
France and England equally endeavor, in the language of the Se
cretary of State, to mount their marine on the deftru&ion of our
fifhery.
The fifh of Newfoundland is allowed liberal bounties by the
English government ; and in the French Weft-Indiesâwe meet
bounties on. their fifh, and duties on our own, and thefc amount
to the price of the fifh : From the English iHands we are quite (hut
outâ yet such is the force of our natural advantages that we have
not yielded to these rivajs. The Scciftary of State has Hated
these, and 6th, of his report.
The more fifh we catch the cheaper ; the English fifh will need
a greater bountyâwhereas if we should yield, the English would
probably need no bounty at all ; they would have the monopoly.
For example, suppose the English can fifh at two dollars the quin
talâwe catch so much that we fell at one dollar and two thirds;
the loss to them is J dol. each quintal. They mufl have that sum
as a bounty.
W-heieas if we encreafe our fifhery, a greater and a greater
bounty is needed by foreign nationsâthe contest so painfully sus
tained by there mufl be yielded at last, and we shall enjoy alone
an immense fund of wealth to the nation, which nature has made
ours ; and though foreigners disturb rhe poflefiion we shall finally
enjoy it peaceably and exclufivelv. If the lands of Kentucky are
invaded, you drive off the invader, arid so you oughtâwhy not
protest this property as well.
Tfiefe opinions are fnpported by no common authority.---The
State of MafTachufetts having reprcfented the difcouragcments of
the filherv, the fubjeft has received the fanftion of the Secretary
ol State ; he confirms the facts stated in the petition ; he fays it is
too poor a bufincfsto pay any thing to government. [SÂ« page 12.]
Yet instead of a(king bounties, or a remission of the duties on
the articles consumed, we a(k nothing, but to give us our own
money back, which you received under an engagement to pay it
back, in cafe the article should be exported.
If nothing was in view therefore, but to promote national
â wealth, it frems plain that this branch ought to be protested and
preserved ; because, under all the discouragements it fuffers, it
encieafes, and every vearmcreand more enriches the coutuiy,
and promises to become an inexhauftable fund of wealth.
Another view has been taken of thefubjeft which is drawn from
the naval protection afforded in time of war by a filherv.
_ Our coasting and foreign trade are increasing rapidly; but the
richer our trade becomes, the better prize to the enemy': So lar
from protecting us it would be the very thing that would tempt
bim to go to war with us. As the rice and the tobacco plantei
cheerfully pay for armies and turn out in the militia to protest
their property on shore, they cannot be so much deceived as to
with to have it left unprsteaed when it is afloat ; especially when
it is known that this proteflion, though more effcÂ£tual than the
â whole revenue expended on a navy could procure, will not cost a
farthing ; on the contrary, it will enrich while it piotcflsthe na
tion. The coasters and other seamen in the event of a war would
be doubly in demand, and could neither protest themfelvcs nor
annov the enemy to any confiderablc degree; but the Sfhermen
thrown out ol business by a war, would be instantly in action
They would as they formerly did, embark in privateer-âhaving
nothing to lose, and every thing to hope, thev would not difho
nor their former fame. Their mode of life makes them exnert
and hardy feamcn. Nothing can he more adventurous They'
cad anchor on the banks. 300 leagues from land, and with a ercat
length ol cable ride out the storms of winter : If the gale proves
too strong they often fink at their anchors, and are food for filh
which they came to take ; lor ever wet, the sea almost becomes
their cementâcold and labor, in that region of fro ft, brace their
bodies and they become as hardy as the Bears, on the islands of
ice; their (ktU and spirit are not inferiorâ familiar with danger
they defpifc it. If I were to recite their exploits the theme would
find every American heart already glowing wilh the recoiled!,on
ol them ; it would kindle more emhnfiafm than the fubieft has
need of: My view is only to appeal to lasts to evince the impor
tance of the filhery as a means of naval protection. It is nrooer
to pars over Bunker's hill, though memorable by the valor of a
regiment of fifbermen ; nor is it necelTaiy to mention further that
500 fifliermcn fought at Trenton.
It i. known that the privateers man'd by fiffiermen, in want of
every thing, not excepting arms, which thev depended on takine
from their enemies-brought into port warlike fto.es of every
rnv 35 eV " y us mcrchan< ' i Â« Sufficient for ,he ar!
my and the country : the war could not be carried on without
them. Among other exploits almost beyond belief, one instance
Â» worth relating-âthese people in a privateer of ,6 guns and t S o
men, ,n one crutfe took more than 20 Ihips with upwards of 200
guns and nearly 400 men.
The privateers from a single diftria of MatTachufetts where the

beg, and earnestly too. that gentlemen will not trust their fir ft o
pinions and vote against the bill, without condescending to re
ceive and to weigh the faÂ£ts and calculations of its advocates.
The firfl qurftion is, how much docs government receive by the
duty on the fait used in curing the fifh which is exported.
The quantity of lifh mull be known.
Several ways of information are to be explored.
The Secretary of State supposes the fifh of 1790, to be 354,276
quintals.
A treasury return of fifh exported from Aug. 20th, 1789, to
Sept. 30th, 1790, which is 13^-months, is 378,721 quintals.
For a year equal to 340,849
See Secretary's Report, page 16.
Foreign dried fifh imported from 15th Anguft, 1789, to August
1 79Â°Â» 37 01 quintalsâs per cent, drawback thereon is only 310
dollars,at i|- dollars per quintal.
Mr. Giles is mistaken in supposing that foreign fifh dcdu&s
16,000 dollars from oureftimate.
Return of fifh in 7 months, from May 30th to December, 1790,
exportedâall fifli of the United States, 197,278 quintals ;
Which for a year is 338,184 do.
The medium may be fairly taken for the time pad at 340,000
quintals a year.
Six gentlemen of Marblehead certify, that 5043 hogsHeads, or
40,344 bushels of fait were used on 38,4973 quintals ; which for
340,000 quintals, gives 356,200 bushels.
The duty at 12 ccnts is 42,744 dollars, which government re
ceives.
But the charge to the United States is, at 13J cents doI!.Â«.
per quintal, 45,900
Whereof the fifliery receives 10 cents on each quintal
exported,
Charges as the law stands
Further this is but an estimate made up from what the last year
proved. The next mav be very different, and probably it will
be. If more monev should be demanded than 44,000 dollars,we
must not be accused of misleading Congress. But in that cafe an
increase would be made by the lawâfor the more fifh is exported
the more igi cents to be paid ; so that the bill creates no burden
in that way. Bur rfie increase of the export of fifh will
operate in favor of government. For it is known that the econo
my, skill and a&ivitv of the fifherv are making progress. It's
luccefs has progressed. The more fifh to a vefTel, the cheaper the
allowance on the tonnageâTherefore the tonnage of vefTels will
not ir.creafe in a ratio with the increase of the filb.
The very obje&ions prove this. For they deem the encourage
ment too great. But anv encouragement mud have the cffeÂ£l.
The difference of the x greemepts for distributing the fifh accord
ing to the present pra&ice, or by this bill, makes a great one in
the quantity taken. The bill reform!? the practice in this point.
Marble head veflels take less than those from Beverly. The for
mer throw the fifh into a common stock, which is afterwards di
vided upon a plan very unfriendly to exertion. A man works
lor the wholeâperhaps 12 hours, and they take about 800 quin
tals to a vefTel. But in Beverley, the exertion is as great as can
oe madeâlÃ hours a day, because each man has what he catches,
and they catch noo quintals..
Marblehead seamen failinf; from other town?, and dividing as
last mentioned, which the bill eftablifV.es, frldom fail to catch 2
300 qu,nta, Sm Â° re Chanel, and men from Marblehead on
the hrlt plan Accordingly I assert on good authority, that the
increase in Marblehead only may be computed at 1 c,ooo quintals,
merely in confeqtiencc ofthe reform by the bill. ' The heft in
armed persons whom I have consulted, entertain no doubt that
he export in cafe the bill should pass, would not be less than
400,000 quintals, probably moreâbut at 400,000 quintals, it
would add 7,200 dollars more to the fait dutv : a sum more

ft has been asked, as if some cunning wa* de
teifted, why if the money received in the trtÂ»f o "
ry to pay the drawbacks is equal to the proposed
bounties,a further appropriation should be made ?
This cunning question admits of several very si m !.
pie answers.
The bill being for 7 years, the average product
is the proper Jum to be calculated. But the
firft years may fall /hort of the bounties, fayiooo
dollars a year, which is 6000
The 4 last may exceed 2000 8000 "
Shall a poor fifherman wait for the whole, or
if he takes his part according to the money in

2d. This delay would happen after a bstf year
the very time when he would mo ft need proirfot
pay. r
jd- But fifh taken this year will no; be export
ed till December next. Therefore the money
will not be Hopped by the drawback as the law
stands, till 6 months after.
34Â» 000

A ftfbftitute has been propoferl for the clause
to appropriate the drawback only.'
This is absolutely improper. For the to cents
allowed as drawback is but a part of the tlutv
paid on l.iltâlt is not easy to fee any reason why
a part flopped at the treasury Humid be equal to
the whole paid there long before. The draw
back falls near 9000 dollars short of the fait duty
received by the government. The expence of
the drawback would be verv heavy and useless.
Nor may gentlemen apprehend* that govern
ment, by paying next december, will advance
money to the fifhery. The fait, duty will have
been paid, and government will have the trie of
the money many months befpre the filbermen
will have a right to call for the bounties.
It is left to the candor of the gentlemen who
have urged this objection, whether a better or
further answer is desired.
After having laboriously gone thro the estimate
of the probable export of fi(h, it will not be ne
cefl'ai y to he equally minute as to the quantittor
kind of vessels which are to receive the bonti^.
The estimate we belive to be very high. Th*t
it is high enough, we fnppofe very probable from
the estimate of the Secretary ot State, tfhichii
only tq,tÃj tons.
This modeof paying the bounty on the tonnage
is very (imple and fafeâThe measurement is al
ready made and costs nothing ; and as it was
made to pay a duty on tonnage, we are very fare
that government will not be cheated by an over
nieafure. The mode of paying the drawback,as
the law now flands, is expensive, perplexed and
embarrafiing ; liable to frauds and delays.
This intricate and disgusting detail ofcalcula
tions was neceflary, to fatisfy the committee that
each of the three grounds of defence on which
the bill reds, is tenable.
Instead of impoverishing the nation by scatter
ing the treasure of the whole to benefit a part,
it appears that we are preserving a mine of trea
sure.
In point of naval protection, we can scarcely
estimate the fifhery too highly. It is alvvavsrea
dy. always equal to the objectâit is alinoil the
only fufficient source of security by sea. o ur
navigation is certainly a precious interelt of the
country. But no part of our navigation can vie
with the fifhery in tefpect to the protection it af
fords.
There is no point which regards our national
wealth or national fafetv, in refpedl to which it
seems practicable to tlo so much with so little.
We rely on the evidence before you, that the
public will not sustain the charge of a dollar.
Those ought not to doubt the evidence who can
not invalidate it. If then the fifherinen ast: ye"
to restore only their own money, will you deny
them ? Will you return to every other per'" l
exporting dutied goods the money he has p sl "i
and will you reful'e the poor fifhermen !
If there must be an instance of the kind, Wi "
you single out for this opprefiive partiality, that
branch which is described by the. Secretary o
Stare as too poor even to bear its part of the com
mon burden. That branch which neverthe' e<

THE D A Y.
SF.F, with wide intervals of time and foace,
Mow few are fcaitered of lite hero race ;
Heaven seem-; to raise them in the expanse of air,
Rc'ulgcnt stars that btaz.e, and dtfappcar ;
Jo deck the and mark the wanderer's wav
And ehear the nations with benignant ray :
Rnt from the centre how they rulh afar#
And coinet-like, shed pestilence and wa-\
Genius how rare, beftow'd how much in vain,
Or worseâdestroyer of the race tjf man !
The foul that iparkles with celestial fire,
Lights up of power the unquenchable desire ;
Strong parts to ftrongcr palTions lend their force.
And fwift ambition kindles in its courseâ
How fierce the rage from rivallhip that springs.
How welcome vengcancc wrcak'd on tyrant Kiogs f
How vi&ory shouts, how glory lights the fkics,
And dazzling lustre overpowers his eyesâ
Now drunk and blind with powerâthe world his own,
Hefcorns all duties, and wouid reign alone.
Curlt with the rage for fame the hero's age
Seems still to redden in the historic page ;
There truth infh utts us, while our sorrows flow,
More than the tragic muse (hedeals in woe.
Now birtory (miles delighted with her theme,
And to admiring nations tells thy name 5
Thy name, O WASHINGTON, their zeal inspires.
Slaves drop their chains, and glow with patriot fires.
Another sunshine seems to cheer mankind,
And from the froft ot ages thaws the mind ;
Wak'd by the vernal breeze, fee Poland, France,
With vouth renew'd, and vig'rous health advance.
Another spring has (lied a sweet perfume,
What fruits are promis'd by so rich a bloom !
Round the whole earth mav liberty be spread,
And vanquifh'd flaverv hide her hated head.
The genial Oar, presiding at thy birth
Vot to thy country gave thee, but the eaÂ»"th.
Yet in what region 'twixt the pole and line
Is not thy country's glory spread with thine ?
The tongue of Fame is never tir'd of thee,
And virtue criesâmy champion he shall be ;
The power confer'd he uses in my cause,
He fav'd his countryâyet lefpelis the laws ;
Yet famebv others followed, follows him,
And kings with envy fee their crowns glow dim ;
They hide their vulgar heads, compdl'd to own
How much by virtue, fortune is outdone.
With tears of anxious joy, thy country hears.
The long recital of thy sixty years ;
And fees how well thy virtues have combin'd
Repulsive partsâand by affection jom'd :
But ah ! looks forward to a dreary shore,
For fate ordains that thou shall be no more.
Union withdifcord holds a doubtful ftrife.
Our liberty seems lengthen'd with thy lifeâ
To thee may ev'ry gale of heav'n bring health,
A boon more precious than a nation's wealth
If heav'n thy valu'd being should prolong,
Habit may make the sense ot Union strong,
Thy breath the bond that keeps us join'd and free-
Thus thy admiring country lives with thee.
This dav (and noton the lull inft. as mentioned in a former
paper) the President ot the United States enters into the 6a It
year of his age.âThe occasion will excite a glow of patriotism >
and gratitude ill the breast of every friend to freedom and man
kind.
The eledlion of Governor tor the State of New-
York is drawing nigh. Three candidates have
been ltartedâHis Excellency the prefentGover
nor, the Hon. John Jay, Chief Justice, and the
Hon. Aaron Burr, Senator of the United States.
Anthony Morris, Esq. is eledted Senator of
this Commonwealth, in the room of the Hon.
Richard Peters, resigned.
It seems to be lamented that there are writers
who vindicate any of the proceedings of Con
gress. We are told of ministerial puffers and
sycophants. Where one piece appears for go
vernment. are there not a score against it?âlt
seems as if sedition had an hundred tongues, and
all of brass.
One of the legion of fault-finders (for they are
many) in a late paper, in a very devout and ten
der hearted sentence, denounces the vengeance
of Heaven on the government, becaufcit has op
prefled the widow and fatherlefs in the provision.
for the public debt. The fame writer, however,
it seems, would .help them no further than by his
prayers, or rather his maledidiions onCongrefs;
for he considers the provision for the debt unÂ«
constitutional, being against the general welfare.
The creditors, doubtless, are a minor part, so
that the general welfare or convenience is plain*
ly on the fide of making no provision for the
debt. It goes terribly against the conftiugtion
of great numbers to pay their debts. Perhaps
this is the ground of the writer's constitutional
obje<flian to the funding art. He is also averse
to an import tax âBoth these difficulties, howe
ver, are overlooked, when he has occasion to
mention the opprefEon of the fatherlefs and the
widows. He calls do-m divine vengeance 011
Congrefiiâyet he deems a provision' by law for
the debt unconstitutional, and the revenue to pay
it oppressive. What a friend to the widows anal
fatherlefs !
