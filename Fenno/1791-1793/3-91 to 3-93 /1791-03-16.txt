Discourses on DavilaâNo. 26.
THESE reasons of the Queen, urged and re
peated with energy, would have staggered
the King of Navarre,, and perhaps the Constable,
if the Duke of Guise would have listened to them.
But he wilhed for warâby the favor of which he
flattered himfelf, he Ihould recover and even in
treafe his ancient power. Moreover, in quality
of Chief, and Protecftor of the Catholic party, he
wished to annul, by any means whatever, all
that had been done againlt his inclination, to
the prejudice of the Churchâand to arrogate to
hiinfelfall the glory of such a revolution. He
conibatted therefore, with vivacity, all the rea
sons of the Queen, and remonstrated to his con
federates, that they would infallibly lose all
their credit and reputation, by fuffering them
selves to be so easily amused by a woman, who
had no other design than to throw herfelf into
the arms of the opposite party as soon as they,
from a blind confidence in her words, should de
part from Court. Nothing" added the Duke,
4 will be more prejudicial to cur cause, nor more
4 infamous for us, than to avow that it is neither
' the public good, lior the maintenance of the
' Royal Authority, but private paflions and per
' fonal interests, which have put us in motion.
4 It will be believed, that the remorse of ourcon
* sciences, has obftrudted us, in the pursuit ofour
' enterprise. The artificial discourses of the
4 Queen, ought not to prevail with us, to abandon
Â« a resolution, maturely weighed, and taken by
* concert, nor to interrupt the execution of a pro
' jeet, ditlated by reason, prescribed by honor,
4 and commanded by that attachment, which we
4 have profefl'ed to religion, whose preservation
< and interest, have chiefly determined us to this
4 measure. It is 110 longer the season to delay,
4 and to waste time in disputes. Already the
4 1 rince of Cond<= is advancing in armsâthe for
< ces of the Hugonots are alfcmbledâthey are
' ready to fciznw the person oj the King, if *<us do
4 not hajten to place him in a situation of fafetyâand
4 since we caunot terminate this affair by perfnafion,
4 let us not be intimidated from employing force : Let
' us take away the King, and leave the Queen to
4 take the part which Jheihall judge moll conven
-4 ient. The resolutions of this Princess are of
4 little moment to us, as soon as we (hall be fup
< ported by t he prefenee of our lawful Sovereign,
4 aided by ihe authority of the firit Prince of the
' blood, to whom, by right of birth belongs the
' government of the kingdom.'
The Prince of Condi, united with theColignis
and other Lords of |iis party, approached the
Court. TheConftable, and tlieKiugof Navarre,
persuaded by the Duke ofGuife, gave the Queen
to understand, that it was neceilary 10 take her
resolution, without loss of time ; that for them
selves, they hadrefolved to conduct to Paris, the
King, and his brothers, for fear they should fall
into the hands of the Hugonots, who, according
to intelligence, were not far diltant. That they
would not abandon their mailer ro the mercy of
I>ereticks, who intended to take him away, in or
der to make an ill use of his name, and under
mine the foundations of the monarchy. That
there was no time to be 1011, or trifled away.â
That they Jhould couduil the King to Paris, as their
own honor, and the good of the ft ate required : That
as to herfelf, they pretended not to constrain her
in any thing ; but fliould leave her, with all the
refpetft that was due to her, at libertyto dispose
of her person, as (he should think (it. The Queen
was not afloniflied at this declaration, bold and
sudden as it was. She had forefeen it, and de
termined, beforehand, on her plan, in such a si
tuation. Forced to declare lierlelf, altho flie tore
jaw that the two parties would soon come to
blows, flie would not abandon the Catholic pany :
She pretended that her honor, and her reason,
attached her to it : She imagined flie saw her
fafety, and that of her children in it. Taking
therefore in an inltant her resolution, ihe anfvver
ed,with her usual presence of mind, that no per
son was more attached than herfelf to the Catholic
religion, nor more zealous for the good of the
StateâThat flie would, upon this occasion, give
way to their sentimentsâand since they were all
for quitting Fontainbleau, flie would concur with
them.
With the utmost promptitude (lie gave orders
for their departure ; but at the fame time she
wrote to the Prince of Cond= a letter, in which
she lamented, that flic could not commit herfelf,
Wednesday, March 16, 1791-
and the person of the King, into the hands of his
partizans, according to the promise ihe had made
him : That the Catholics had prevented them,
by conducting them by force to Paiis: That,
provided he did not lose his courage, ftie exhort
ed him not to fuffer his enemies to take pofleflion
of tiie whole authority of government. She then
commenced her journey, with the King and her
other children, surrounded by the Triumvirate,
and the other Catholic Lords, who to console her,
treated her with great refped: and honor. She
arrived that evening at Melun, the next day at
Vincennes, and in the morning ofthe third day
at Paris. Many persons observed the young
King in tears, thinking the Catholic Lords had
deprived him of his liberty. The Queen, irri
tated by the ill-success of her artifices, and fore
feeing the calamities of an inevitable war, disco
vered, during the whole journey, a mournful and
mortified air and countenance. The Dnke of
Guise was so little afFedted with this, that he said
freely and openly, that the public good was a pub
; lie good, whether it was obtained byconfent or by force.
The Prince of Conde was informed, upon his
march, of the departure of the King, and per
ceiving himfelf either prevented by the Catho
lics, or deceived by the Queen, made a halt, and
remained sometime undecided, what course he
(lioukl rake. The terrible picture of those dan
gers which threatened him, presented itfelf in
lively colours before his ejes ; but the Admiral,
who had remained â¢Â» little in the rear, arriving,
they conferred together a few minutes, and the
Prince, with a profound sigh cried out, " The
Die is call, we are too far advanced to retreat."
He took immediately another road, aud march
ed with rapidity towards Orleans, of which, he
had for sometime resolved to take pofleflion.
This city, one of the principal of the Kingdom,
about thitty leagues from ParL, is vast, well
built, and very populous ; it is situated in the
province ofÃeauce, alinoll in the middle of France
upon the banks of the Loire, a Jarge navigable
river, which after having watered leverals pro
vinces, falls into the ocean in Britany. Orleans,
by its navigation, the fertility of its territory, its
reputation, and its facility of communication
with several other provinces, appeared to the
| Prince very proper for a place of arms and the
I center of his party, and to be opposed in foine
j fort, to Paris
For several months, that he had meditated to
nake hinifelf matter ot this city, he had enter
ained a secret intelligence with some of the in
labitants, inclined to the do>ftrines of Calvin,
.vhoin he employed to engage a great part of the
roung men, who were reftlei's, fediiious and gree
dy of novelties. As it is not intended to relate
in detail, the whole of this hiltory, it is fuffi
cient to fay that he got pofleflion ofOrleans, that
the two parties published manifeftos, and that
chicanery, negociations, battles, sieges, confla
grations and aflaffinations, succeeded in all their
usual train of horrors in civil wars.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, Feb. 4.
The HANK BILL under cons deration.
MR. BOUDINOT faidhe meant to confine
himfelf to two or three great points on
which the whole argument appeared to him to
reft. He considered the objections to the bill as
pointed against its constitutionality and its ex
pediency. It was efl'ential he observed, that
every member fliould be fatisfied as far as poflible
of the firft, for however expedient it might be, if
it was clearly unconstitutional the bill (houlcl ne
ver receive thefaniSion of the representatives of
the people. He would in a great measure refer
its expediency, if constitutional, to the experi
ence of every gentleman of the House, as the
1110 ft fatisfacftory proof on that head, and he con
ceived there was no need of much argument in
fupporc of its decilionâThe firft queltion then
wasâls Congress vested with a power to grant
the privileges contained in the bill ? This is de
nied and ought to be proved. In order to fhevv
in what manner this fubjecfthad struck his mind
he firft laid down these principles.
Whatever power is exercised by Congress must:
be drawn from the constitution ; either from the
Â«!Vrprefs words or apparent meaning, or from a
neceflary implication, arising from the obvious
intent of the framers.
That whatever powers (vested heretofore in
any individual State) not granted by this instru
ment are still in the people of such ilatp and can
not be exercised by Congress.âThat whatever
implication dettroys the principle of the confti
tuiion ought to be rejeifted.âTliat in conihuing
an instrument the different parts ought to be so
expounded as to give meaning to every part
which will admit of it.
Having dated these preliminaries, fr.r. Bou- j
dinot proceeded to enquire, what were the pow
ers attempted to be exercised by this bill ? for
until the powers were known the quellion ot
constitutionality could not be determined.
By it Coiigrefs was about to exercise the pow
er of incorporating certain individuals, thereby
establishing a Banking Compauy " for fucccfsfull}
conducing th; finances of the nation
The next enquiry isâWhat rights will this
Company enjoy in this new character, that they
do not enjoy independent of it ?âEvery indivi
dual citizen had an undoubted right to purchase
and hold property, both real and personal, to
any amount whateverâtodifpofe of this proper
ty to whom and on Vhat terms he pleasedâto
lend his money (in legal interest to any person
willing to take the fame, and, indeed, to exer
cise every power over his property that was con
tained in the bill. Individual citizensthen, hav-
ing these powers, might also aliociate together
in company or copartnerfliip and jointly exer
cising the fame rightsâmight hold lands in joint
tenancy or as tenants in common to any amount
whateverâmight put any sum of money into
joint stockâmight iff'ue their notes to any amount
âmight make bye-laws or articles of copartner
fhipfor their own government, and finally, might
set up a bank to any amount, however great, and
no authority in the government could legally in
terfere with the exercise of these rights. The
great difference between this private aflociation
of citizens in their individual capacities, and the
company to be created by this bill, and which is
held up in so dangerous a light, is, that the one
exposes the company ro the neceflity of ufingeach
individual's name in all their tranfatftions âsuits
mult be brought in all their namesâdeeds mufl
be taken and given in like mannerâeach one in
his private estate is liable for the default of the
reftâthe death of a member dilfolved the part-
nerlhip as to himâand for want of apolitical ex
igence, the union may be dillolved by any part
of its members, and of course many obvious in
conveniencies must be fnffered merely of an of
ficial kind. By the bill, thcfe difficulties are to
be removed, by conveying three qualities to them.
ift. Individuality, or constituting a number of
citizens into or.e legal artificial body, cabable by
a fictitious name, of exercising the rights of an
individual
2d. Irresponsibility in their individual capa
city, not being answerable beyond tlie joint cap
ital.
3d. Durability, or a political existence for a
certain time, not to be aftedted by the natural
death of its mejnbers.
These are the whole of the powers exercised,
and the rights conveyed. It is true these are con
venient and advantageous to the company, but
of trifling importance when considered as a right
or power exercised by a national legislature, for
the benefit of the government. Can it be of any
importance to the state whether a number of its
citizens are considered in legal contemplation as
united in an individual capacity, or Separately
as so many individuals, especially if the public
weal is thereby promoted. By their irrefponfi
bility being known, every person dealing with
them gives his tacit consent to the principle, and
it becomes part of the contract. And by politi
cal duration, their powers and abilities are lim
ited, and their rights relhiifted, so as to prevent
any danger that might arise from the exercise of
their joint natural right, not only as to the amount
of their capital, but as to the bye laws they might
make for their government.
A private bank could make contrails with the
government, and the government with them, to
all intents and purposes, as great and important
as a public bank, would their capital admit of it;
though they would not poflefs fucli qualities as
to juftify the confidence of government, by de
pending on them in a time of danger and necef
lity. This might put it in the power of any in
dividuals to injure the community in its ellencial
interests, by withdrawing the capital when molt
needed. To prevent this and many other incon
veniencies, it is neceflary that a bank for the
purposes of govern ment should be a legally arti
ficial body, poflefling the three qualities above
mentioned.
Mr. Boudinot then took up the Constitution,
to fee if this simple power was not fairly to be
drawn by neceflary implication from those veiled
by this inllrument in the legislative authority of
the United States. It sets out in the preamble
with declaring the general purposes for which it
waÂ» formedâ" The infurancc of domejlic tranquil
ityâpftvifion for the common defence âand promotion
of the general welfare." These are the prominent
features of this instrument, and are confirmed
and enlarged by thefpecific grants in the body of
it, where the principles 011 which the legislature
should reft their after pi oceedings are more fully
laid down, and the division of power to be exer
cised by the general and particular governments
dilliniftly marked out. âBy the Bth feifuon, Con
gress has power " to levy taxes, pay debts, provide
If or the commou defence and general -welfare, declare
-jjar, rat ft: and support armies, provide J or andmain
782
tain a navy," and as the means to accomplilh these t
important ends, "to borrow mouty," and finally, "
"to make all laws, necejfary and proper, f or car' A
rying into execution the foregoing powers." 9
Let us then enquire,âls the conltituting a pab- â 
lie bank lieceflary to these important and eflential 'â 
ends of government âif so, the right to exercise jfl
the power mult be in the fuprcme legislature. ,ffl
"He argued that the power was not contained iu|fl
express words, but that it was necefiariiy
ced by the itrongefr and molt decilive
tion, because he contended that it was a
means to attain a iitccjfary end. Necellary
tion had led Congress, under the power to
and collect impolt, and taxes, to eitablilh
for the collectionâto infuift penalties

The following Letter was addrefled by the late

the death of Mrs. Lawrance :
Dear Sir, . J
At a time when all friends ought to fhewthetrj
kindness, with a character which ought to ma

that you have yet heard nothing of me. _ j

physic five times, and opiates I think fix.
day it seems to remit. , r
" The loss, dear Sir, which you have lately luN,
fered, I felt many years ago ; and know their-,
fore how much has been taken from you,
how little help can be had from consolation. twj
who outlives a wife whom he has long ove ,
himfelf disjoined from the only nnnd t .at _
the fame hopes and fears and interest ; tronil l
only companion with whom he lias stared 1
good or evil ; with whom he could fe_t his
at liberty, to retrace the past, or antiopafuture. The continuity of being is lacerated ;
the fettled coutfeof fentimenc and a<ftion is (top
ped ; and life stands suspended and motionlets,
till it is driven by external causes into a new
channel. But the time of fufpence is dreadful.
Our firft retourfe in this dillrefsful folitude,is,
perhaps, for want of habitual piety, to a gloomy
acquiescence in necessity. Of two mortal beings,
one must lose the other. But iurely there is a
higher and a better comfort to be drawn from
the conllderation of that Providence which watch
es over all ; a belief that the living and the dead
are equally in the hands of God, who will re
unite those whom he has separated, or who lees
that it is belt not to re-unite then).
The King's compliments of congratulation to
their Imperial Majelties, on the Emperor's electi
on as Ivir.g of the Romans, were sealed up before
the cabinet council, at the Secretary of States'
office, on Monday night, and the Earl of Elgin,
appointed amballador extraordinary to the court
of Vienna, to deliver the fame; with which his
lordship set off immediately.
Earl Cornwallis, on acconnt of the present com
plexion of affairs in India, continues Gov. Gene
ral some time longer.
According to letters from Berlin, a great change
has taken place in the ministry there, through
the influence of Prince Henry, the King's uncle.
Comte de Hertzberg, the prime minister, has re

The town is now under the protection of the

complete, both here and all over the couutry.
The Patriot party is now quite annihilated, the

arretted this morning, in attempting to escape
to England, and is now a prisoner. General
Koehler, commander in chief, is expected here

The King's letter upon the Civil Conjlitntion of the
i HIS morning, Mr. Andre, the Prelident,wait
ed on the King to know if the'decree on the con
ititutioii of the clergy had been accepted. The
King Tent the following answer in writing :
which immediately caused the warmeit debates,
and is likely to be followed by the moil alarming
consequences.
" In accepting the decrees upon the civil con
stitution of the clergy, I announced to the Nati
onal Affenibly that 1 would take the most conve
nient measures to secure the execution of that
decree. From that time, I have not cealed to
think 011 the fubjeft. The decree of the 27th of
November being 110 more than a confcquence of
that of July, 110 doubt ought to be entertained
of my intentions ; but its execution appears to
me to require the greatest attention. My refpeifl
for religion, and my desire to fee the constitution
eltablilhed, without agitation, and without trou
ble, have made me redouble my activity in the
measures I have taken, and I hope the National
Aflembly will agree with me, by employing the
1110 ft lenient measures, and fucli as would be mod
secure from troubling the public tranquility ; I
hope to consolidate the basis of the constitution
ot the kingdom. I repeat it again to the Allem
bly, that they would place in me all the confi
dence I mtrit."
This letter caused a long debate, which con
cluded with a decree, that " the IVefidentfoonld
wait on ilie King to-morrow, to desire him to give
an anfwcr (fignetl by his Majesty, and counter
signed by a JVliniller} to the dccice oi' the 27th

WILMINGTON, March 2
We are happy to inform our readers, that the
improvments in grift-mills, lately invented by a
citizen of this ftate,Mr.oliver Evans, are encreaf
ing very rapidly in public eltimation. Every
part of the machinery in which those improve
ments consist, is now in use at the Brandywine
Mills, and is highly approved of. The wheat
elevator has been lately applied,for rhe firil time,
to unload a lhallop ; it elevates 300 bushels per
hour, and enables the miller to convey his wheat
to any granary in the mi'l without the assistance
of manual labor. To Inch perfection are our
grift and merchant mills brought, by the aflifi
ance of those improvements, that we may fay,
perhaps without boasting, that they are not equal
led in the world. The machinery is so well ap
plied, that from the time the wheat leaves the
waggoner's bag, the measurer's hals-bushel or
the veflel's hold, as the cafe may be, no manual
labor is required, but t:ie wheat is converted in
to fuperfine or other flour, fit for packing, en
tirely by the effetfl of the machinery. Mr. Evans
has obtained a patent for hisdifcovery, which we
are happy is like to turn out much to his advan
tage.

feredâthe principal ftrokesare placed by themselves, and accom
panied with particular explanations. A table, or scheme, is ad
ded, which exhibits at one view the component parts of each let
ter, both small and great, placed indifferent clafles, that the learner
may at once perce've, by infpeÂ£lion, the relation and dependence
which one letter has upon another. To which is annexed, a Dia
logue, calculated to fix the attention of children, and impress their
minds with right ideas of the letters. This work is defined for
the benefit of schools, and may be used with advantage by all who
would acquire a knowledge of penmanship.
Five of the remaining fix are proper Writing Books, with Cop

PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION, A
COLLECTION of STATE PAPERS,
INTENDED AS MATERIALS FOR
AN HISTORY OK THE UNITED STATES OF
By EBENEZER A. M.
IN this collcftion will be contained the Charters of the
feveial states which now compose the Union ;âthe Records
of the United Colonies of New-Engi a nd ; âRoyal Induc
tions to Colonial Governors ;âExt r acts from Public
Records ; âand other authentic Documents tending to elucidate
our History.
The deftgn of this compilation was intimated to Congrcfs, and
honored with their approbation.âOn the 20th July, 1778, their
committee, to whom his memorial was referred, reported it as
their " Opinion, that Mr. Hazard's undertaking is laudable and
deserves the public patronage and encouragemenr, as being pro
ductive of public utility;" Whereupon they " Relolved, That
it be recommended to the Governors, Prefidcnts, and Executive
Powers of the several states in the union, to aflift Mr. Hazard,and
give facility to his labors ; and that for this pnrpofe he be admit
ted to an infpe&ion of public records, and be furnifhed without
expence with copies of such papers as he may judge will conduce
to the valuable end he hath in view.
He wasj of consequence, admitted to the infpe&ion and use both
of public records, and the collections made by individuals, from
whence this compilation (much the largest he has ever met with
on the fubjedl, and, he flatters himfelf, the largest ever made in
America) was formed. It has since met the approbation of many
eminent chara&ers,and even in its manuscript slate, has facilitated
the settlement of Tome important controversies.
The compiler cannot suppress the following letter from the honor
able the Secretary of State, to whose inlpeftion part of the com
pilation was submitted, as it contains so flattering and refpefta
blc a testimony in favor of the importance of the work.
" Philadelphia, February 18,1791.
SIR,
I return you the two volumes oj Records, with thanks for the opportu
nity of looking into them :âthey are curious Monuments of the Infancy
of our country. I learn with great fatisfattion that you are about com
mitting to the Press the valuable Hijlnrical and State Papers \cu kink
been so long colfetting. Time and accident are committing daily havoc
on the originals deposited in our public offices : the late war has done the
work oj centuries in this bufmefs : the loft cannot be recovered; but let
usfave what remains ; not by vaults and locks, which fence themjrom
the public eye and use in confgning them, to the wafbe of time, but by such
a multiplication of copies as jhali place them beyond the reach of accident;
this being the tendenc\ of your undertaking, be assured there is noonewhs
wishes it a more complete success than. S 1 i?,
Yout mofl obedient and mofi humble Servant,
THOMAS JEFFERSON."
