REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION
Concerning the Foreign Debts of the United Slates.
AT the commencement of the present go
vernment, in 1789, the United States
were indebted to France, Holland, and Spain,
and to the foreign officers ol the late army, in a
sum amounting to near twelve millions ot dol
lars. Near a million and two-thirds of this sum
was due for arrears of interest, inattention to
which, would have been too difgraceful to have
admitted of a hope ot public credit, until inea
-1 fures were taken for its discharge. Above a
million and one-third of the principal sum had
become due, and the time ot other installments
was coming round. The resources of the coun
try had been examined and considered, but not:
tried. The claims of thefc foreign creditors,
were,originally,the most delicate in themselves;
and in the cafe of France, the ft&te ol her revo
lution in the summer of i79-> placed her de
mand in a situation peculiarly interesting. It
was perceived that the adoption of the Federal
Constitution and the measures taken to restore
public credit, had made strong and favorable
impreflions on the European money-lenders :
and it was not doubted, that the arrears of in
terest and the principal due, might be discharg
ed by loans, upon terms which would produce
very little loss. The requisite authorities were
given by the Legislature, which resulted in the
borrowing of a sum equal to the discharge of all
the exigible debts. But as the occasions of the
French were likely to be emergent, and there
was reason to confide, that a firm and steady
pursuit of the financial system, which had by
that time been adopted, and an adherence to
the upright spirit of the Constitution, would ra
pidly meliorate the credit of the United States,
it was deemed expedient to extend the autho
rities to borrow, to a sum equal to the whole of
the foreign debt, provided the installments not
due could be discharged by means of loans ad
vantageous to the United States. The interest
of above seven millions of the foreign debt, be
ing at the rate of five per cent. per annum, it
was not doubted that the money might be ob
tained so as to render the discharge of the part,
not exigible, really advantageous. It has ac
cordingly happened, that a sum adequate to the
principal and interest due, has been borrowed
' within the terms of the law, so as to support
the credit and good faith of the United States,
1 and critically to accommodate the people of
France. The further expe<stations of Congress
have also been fulfilled ; a considerable loan at
four and one-half, and two loans at four per
cent, having been effected, so as to realize an
advantage in the discharge of a large part of
the principal, which was at an interest of five
per cent. The United States having thus com
: muted their foreign debt, further than is due,
: with honor, and, on a medium of the whole,
, with advantage, are relieved by these operati
ons from any possibility of preflure to perform
the remainder of their European engagements.
The friends of our public credit, of our national
1 fafety and refpe&ability, and of the revolution
of France, among the citizens of the United
States, will reflect upon this actual course of
' events with cordial fatisfaftion.
I The condufion : being mifcellaneowi thoughts on the
government.
The people of the United States enjoy a pe
culiar felicity in the ppifeffion of principles of
government and of civil and religious liberty,
more found, more accurately defined, and more
extensively reduced to practice, than any pre
ceding republicans. There is not one iota of
delegating or delegated power, which is not
poiTelfed, or may not be acquired by every citi
zen. It is true, that there are in practice, se
veral deviations in the distribution of powers
to the various sub-divisions of the country, and
to the proprietors of cei taindefcriptions of pro
perty ; but these are acknowledged departures
from principle, and are known to have risen out
of the antecedent state of things. They could
not be immediately corre&ed without violent
struggles and disorders, and without injury to
the property of descriptions of citizen*, too
great for the country at any former period to
, compensate. Mild remedies are,however, dai
ly applied to these partial diseases; and it is
manifeft, that the course of time is diminishing,
and will finally remove them. The right of le
gislative interposition, on the part of the chief
magistrate, which, in the practice of another
country, has been commuted for an unlawful
and injurious influence, is here wrought into
the essence of the constitution, and is not only
exercised in the independent and uncontrouled
consideration of every resolution and bill, but
by the practical application of the negative.
The execution of the office of the chief ma
gistrate has been attended through a term of
almost four Jyears with a circumstance, which
to this nation and to the surrounding world re
quires no commentaryâa native citizen of the
United States, elevated from private life to
that station, has not, during so long a term, ap
pointed a single relation to any office of honor
or emolument.
The senatorial branch of the government has
been created and continued in a mode prefera-
I ble to that which i-. purfucd in any other nation.

Tne representative branch of the govern
ment is equally well constituted.
The military code for the government of
such troops as are occaiionally raised and em
ployed, is well calculated to produce discipline
and efficiency, when time is allowed for the I
purpose, and consequently to render the United
States refpeftable in the eyes of foreign nations.
All christian churches are so truly upon an e
qual footing, as well in practice as in theory,
that there are and have been in the legiilative,
executive, and judicial branches ot the general
government, persons of the following denomi
nations :âepifcopalians, pve{byteriaii, indepen
dent or congregational, quaker, Lutheran, re
formed Roman, and probably others, which do
not occur. There have been, and indeed yet
are, a few ecclesiastical distinctions in the state
governments, which reason and time are rapid
ly destroying. It is easy to 'perceive that reli
gious liberty supported by the National Conlli
tution, and a great majority of the ftatc con
stitutions, cannot but attain, in a very fliort
time, the fame theoretical and practical perfec
tion in the remainder, which it has acquired in
them.

IN a despotic government the slaves and tools o
power affctt to treat the people with contempt
for though a sovereign without fubje&s, impliei
an abfurditvâand the multitude of the people
rcallv constitutes the glory of a Prince, yet so in.
confident and besotted have the tyrants of the
earth beeru, that the people by whom they reign
and from whom they derive all their support, arc
too often considered in no better a light thar
beasts of burden: hence their obedience to the
laws is a blind spontaneous fubmiflion, withoui
sentiment, and consequently never to be depended
on.âln a free government the cafe is far other
wise; a wife and virtuous people, in refpe&ing
their rulers, honor their o*n chara&erâand the
magistrates, while executing the laws, confidei
themselves as agents of the people and organs of
the public will.âThe name of citizen is the high
est political appellationâand the approbation of
the virtuous majority, the highest reward of an
honest ambition. There are various currents in
the tide of human affairs, ro precipitate nations to
ruin. History and experience afford abundant
teflimony to prove, that free States as well as in
dividuals, have been carried down the smooth
dream of flattery to thegulph of slavery and des
potism : we need only refer to that notable in
stance, Julius Csfar ; if the Roman people had
been invulnerable to the flattery, adulation and
largefles of that nfurprr, they would not have fallen
;he viÂ£Hms of his artifices, the Haves of absolute
luthority. The duties of governors and of the
governed, are reciprocal ; when all impreflions of
efpeft fiom one to the other are obliteratedâon
he one hand government becomes contemptible,
ind is inevitably considered as tyrannicalâon the
)ther, the people become supine and invite mif
ule and oppreflion ; fa&ions fuccccd, and thefc
)verturning the free government, open the door
o anarchy, confufion and dcfpotifni.
There is a public magnanimity of character
vhich ?1 ways accompanies a superior ftatc of civil
ibertv; the loss of this ma'gnanimity generally
>recedes the loss of freedom. This noble fenti
nent should inform, enlighten and animate the
reat public will ; it is this alone which can
nake a people superior to the adulation of those
Â»afe minds, who flatter, to deceive and betrayâ
nd at the fame time equal to sustaining the ele&ri
ying power of truth. For it may fafely be af
erted, that truth and freedom are so intimately
Hied, that whenever the former is found to offend,
he latter very Toon takes its departure.
In feleÂ£ling their civil rulers, a wife people will
iot be deluded by the syren song of unprincipled
latterers ; of all attainments, a proficiency in the
rts of adulation is the easiest of acquisition ; at
he present day the world abounds with models
,n which perfonsof themoft slender abilities may
orm their chara&ers ; and it is too much to be
amented that those who never had honesty enouon
o piopofe an unpalatable truth to the public con
ideration, are considered as patriots. How dif
erently mankind condutt in matters of religious
oncern, from those of a political nature ! The
>opular preacher is he who draws the mod dr
eading picture of our species ; âin politics some
nodern patriots apply a certain do&rine to the
><rO/>/e, which republicans justly reprobate as ap

[iftrate, viz. That the King can do no wrong;
his is daubing wi<h untempered mortar, uniefs it
an be demonftratcd that the popuhr opinion,
lowever variable, is always right. We have fern
n our country a variety of changes in the fenti

ought to meet with the approbation of the people :
those who have whiffled and veered to every dif

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES,
Mr. Fenno*
IJ yourfelf and your brother Printers through the Con

conduSl of Mr. Jefferfon, which appeared in your

the [tgnature of" An American," will now

Philadelphia, September 4, 1792
Mr. Fenno,
IN your Gazettes of the 4th and nth of last
month, there appeared two publications un
der the signature of " An American," replete
with the most virulent abuse of Mr. Jefferfon }
and containing charge 1 ; against him, founded in
the basest calumny and falfhood. The intem
perance of this writer, and his utter difreg&nf
of truth and candor, will be readily perceived
by an impartial public, when they refer to one
of his concluding suggestions in the firft publi
cation, to witâthat Mr. Jefferfon is the patron
and promoter of national di/uviun, national infig
nificanct, public difordcr and discredit ;-*-a fuggeP
tion, made on no better foundation, than
being oppsfed to some of the principles of the'
funding system, of the national bank, and of
certain other measures of the Secretary of the
Treafurv ; an offence, which, I fear, if crimi
nal, will involve a great majority of the inde
pendent yeomanry of our country in equal
Tuilt. How long Mr. Jefferfon has been diftin
riufhed as the Cataline of the day, or as the
imbitious incendiary, who Would light a torch
:o the ruin of his country, may be matter of
lfeful speculation; and whether he is now, for
:he firft time, thus distinguished, because of the
nanly freedom with which he declares his ab
lorrence of some of the leading principles of
Vlr. Hamilton's fifcal administration ; or, that
iccaufe of his known attachment to republic
:anifm, he is feared, as the decided opponent ot
riftocracy, monarchy, hereditary fuceeffion, a
itled order of nobility, and all the other mock-*
ia<*eantry of kingly government, will be the
Ã¼bjedt of future enquiry; in which it will be
:onfidered, how far the distinguishing traits I
lave glanced at, form the appropriate and pro
ninent features in the character of another po
itical luminary, and of the measures of his ad
niniftration. An enquiry like this may be use-
Ul, has been invited by the writer I' refer to,
ind, as the invitation will not be refufed, may,
n the test of comparative merit, disclose fa&s
ind principles in relation to public men, which,
lowever important for the public to know,
low concealed in the arcana of a certain con
"ention, or remain involved in all the obfeurity
if political mystery and deception. At present
nv sole purpose is, by a reference to certain
'aft',, of which I have been pofTeffed by a gen*
leman in this city, to exonerate Mr. Jefferfon
"rom the two principal charges made -against
lim, and, in so doing, to prove the malignity
ind falfhood of them.âThe firft charge is,
â¢ that Mr. Jefferfon was opposed to the present
:onftitution of the United States"âand the
ither is, " that Mr. Jefferfon, when Minister
:o the Court of France, advised Congress to
icgociate a transfer of its debt due to thtt>
"Tench nation to the hands of individuals in 1
Holland, upon the idea, that if the United States
hould fail in making a provision for the debt,
he discontents, to be expected from the omif
ion, may honesty be transferred from a govern
nent able to vindicate its rights, to the breasts
if individuals, who may firft be encouraged to
lecome the substitutes to the original creditors,
ARISTIDES.âd may afterwards be defrauded without dan-
CI"
In re!', tto she f.rft charge, and any ratio
or candid inference to be derived from it,
j. ~,-..'. co , d not ...van that Mr. Jeiferlon was
frier. .1 - to, 'â¢id' re mended the adoption ot
t u e (â¢â - â  , lt ;. a ; and vet, Inch is the plain and
fi m p!c i'.i r. v. kh writer for bis own mli
i\ to.rua ; into an inference,
that M l ' wr. opp,.':d to the constitu
tion, ar.d is yet an eneivy to that, and to the
American Union.
Let tho'b w! o re, ' d the truth, recur to the
Dibates of the Virginia Convention, pages 100
an d i oiâwhere, in the fpee'ch of Mi. Pcndle
ton, the President of thatConventipn, they wil.
find the following fentiinents :
" I was surprised when I hea'd introduced
the opinion of a gentleman (Mr. jefferfon) whom
1 highly refpeft. I know the great abilities of
that gentleman. Providence has, for Me good
of mankind, accompanied thole abilities with a
di'pofition to make u<i of them for the good ot
his fellow beings; and I wilh, with all n.v heart,
that he was here to assist us on this intereftmg
occasion. As to his letter, imprefled, as I am,
with the force of his authority, X think it v is
improper to introduce it 0.1 t is occasion. The
opinion of a private individual, however en
lightened, ought not to influence our decision.
But admitting, that this opinion ought to be
conclusive with us, it strikes me in a different
manner from the honorable gentleman. I have
seen the letter, in which this gentleman has
written his opinion upon this fubjeft. It ap
pe ir ;'that he is pofleled of that Constitution,
and has in his mind the idea of amending it.â
He has in his mind the \ ery question of ttbfe
nu-nt or previous amendments, which is row
und?- consideration. His fentiinents 011 this
fubjet are as follow : â" I wilh with all my
foul, that the nine firft Conventions may accept
the Xew Constitution, because it will secure to
us the good it contains, which I think real and
important. I wilh the four latest, whichever
they be, may refule to accede to it, till amend
nieuts are secured." He then enumerates the
amendment', which he wilhes to be fecuieil,and
add â'â¢ we inuft take care, however, that nei
ther this, nor any other objection so the form,
produce a schism in our Union. That would
be an incurable evil; because friends falling
out, neve â¢ cordially re unite."âAre the r e fen
tiinents in favor of those who wilh to prevent
it" adoption by previous amendment? He wilhes
the firft; nine States to adoot it. What are his
reasons ? Because it wil! r ecure to us the good
it contains, which, he thinks,great and important;
and he wilhes the other four mav refufe it, be
cause he thinks it will tend to obtain necelfory
amendments. But he would not wilh that a
schism Ihould take place in the Union, on avx
conjrdoation. If then we are tcbe influenced by
his opinion at all, we will ratify it, and secure
thereby the good it contains."
The public will observe, that this part of
Mr. Pendleton's speech was made in reply to
another member of that Convention, who then
made the fame attempt to pervert Mr. Jeffer
fon's sentiments, which the present writer has
now doneâand that the unexpected quotation
of Mr. Jefferfon's letter, with the jnft and judi
cious comment upon it, made by Mr. Pendle
ton, arretted the influence of the poison, in that
instance, as I trust it will now do, to the fatis
feftion of an enlightened and impartial public,
to whom, without farther animadversion, it is
submitted.
In re'peft to tlie other charge of the advice
given by Mr. Jefferfon to the former Congress
concerning the French debt, it is worthy re
mark, that the accufcr skulks from the charge,
when, in a note subjoined to his publication, Ire
favsâ" The precise terms are not now recol
lected, but the fubltance maybe depended upon;
the poor Hollanders were to be the victims."â
Thus (tabbing the reputation of an old merito
rious publu servant, by an unwarrantable con
clusion, whillt he disavows a recollection of the
farts, on which lone tV conclusion could be
jnftified. B.'t the pitiful evasion will not avail
him; he has produced a falemn charge at the
tribunal of the publicâa charge, which, involv
ing no fiuall de :rrr of moral turpitude, will
render the accused, if guilty, unworthy the con
fidence off his fellow citizens. It is his duty,
therefore, to substantiate his charge, not b\
vague and unfounded inference, but by an ap
peal to truth, a reference to plain and simple
facts, and a recital of the preci'e terms of the
advice given by Mr. Jeffe son; without a
Knowledge of which, the public cannot be ena
bled to render a just or impartial judgment â
If he fails in this, the public will regard him as
a ba e and wicked calumniator. I have no
hop;, howeve', that he will ever attempt to
bring forward the proofs of this chargeâfatis
fied with the time, manner and efleft of his ca
lumny, he will now retreat behind an anonymous
filature, and vent his flanders at the reputa
tion of anv other honest man he meets, like a
coward; affaflin, who strikes ia the dark, and
securely v.ounds, because he is unseen.âl fav,
he will retreat, because he well knows, notwith
standing anv affected ignorance on the fubjeft,
that bv an appeal to facts, the truth will appear
that Mr. Jefferfon gave advice to Congress ex
prefslv contrary to that which he has ascribed
to him.âThat this was the cafe, and that Mr.
Jefferfon even pointed out a mode by which the
honor and credit of t ie United States might be
p e'erved, can and will be proved to the public,
if the pre ont accuser (hall dare to bring for
ward the proof in support of his charge.
It ha; be?n faifl, Mr. Fenno, that a certain
heid of a department is the real author oÂ«- in
itiator of this utiprovokecjand unmanly attack
on Mr. Jefiferfo âand that the time of that
gentle departure from this city, on a visit
to his home, was considered as best foited to
answer the tlefign it was intended to efteft
Be that as it may, or whether the writer be of
this or that state, or of th's or that partv, cer

OSTEND,, July 19
Yesterday we received an account
of a battle between the French and
Auftrians, in which the latter were
vi&oiious. It is said, 1200 French
were killed, and 600 taken.âln con
feqoence of this defeat, the town of
Orchies is in pofleilion of the AulVri
ans, with a great quantity of It 01 es of
all kinds. On Monday the Austrian
army was reinforced by 28,000 men,
lately arrived from Germany.
M. Valid,uiune has this moment
arrived from Lisleâhe was a f'pecta
tor of the battle : it was between
Lisle and Orchies. The body of
French were 5000, who were going
from Lille to Alsace : they were at
tacked by 16 or 1700 Auftrians, who
rather had the worll of it at fir ft ;
but in the end made terrible havock,
and drove the enemy into Lifle.whei e
they were very badly received by the
people.
W A R S A W, June 20.
Some days ago, the account of the
Ruffians entering Wiloa, was made
public here.
Two battles have taken place, the
one on the ioth of June, where we
101 170 men, and the second 011 the
nth, which did not last long. We
were obliged to retreat, which we
effected in the bed order. Hoili bat
tles were fought near Mire and Swer
zen.
The King will go this week to Ko
ziniice, and from thence 10 the camp
at Lubar, in otdei to adt in conjunc
tion with General Poniatowfki.
M. Bulgakow, Ruffian anibaflador,
has not yet left this place.
M. Ignace Potocki, grand Marshal
of the grand Dukedom of Lithuania,
arrived here from Berliu ; the an
fwer he brought from that court is laid
to be unfavorable 10 our republic.
Camp, near Zanjlaw, June 19.
Fighting and marching for ihele
five days pait, have left us no time to
give regular accounts of our motion
and fit uation.
On the 14th inft. having perceived
a column of Ruffian troops on the
right of our camp at Lubar, and ano
ther on the left, crofling the river
bluez, our General, Prince J. Ponia
towfki, ordered Gen. Kofciulzko,with
four battalions of infantry, one bri
gade of national cavalry, and one
pulk of light hoi fe, to march towards
Czartorija ; whillt General Urelhorf
ki, with Ihe brigade of Mukzonow iki,
went along the river Sluez, to recon'
noitre the enemy towards Oftropol.
The Prince hiinfelf soon followed
with the sth regiment of Luboniirlki
He found Gen. Urelhotfki already
engaged with four battalions of chal
(ems, two battalions of light horse
and a pulk of Coflacks. Seeing our
cavalry pre lied by superior numbers
rhe Prince fell on the left flank of 1 he
enemy, which put them into confuii-
ARISTIDES.
114
Oil, and they retreated towards Uri
niopol, where the vanguard of Gen.
Kochowfki was eficamped, composed
of* two battalions of grenadiers, two,
chito of challffurs, two pulks of light
horse, one piilk of cnrafiiers, and one
'ditto of collitcks. After having re
connoitred ilie Hifiny, the Prince,
returning towards Lobar, gave or
ders to It) ike t lie camp, and the whole
.u my began the liiari h at tour 111 the
morning, leaving Gen. Urelboifki vo
bring uptherear. The rear was con
tinually liarraHed by 4000 Ruffians,'
lill coiningto Corufzkowee, our march
was interrupted by a fatal accident.
I he wooden bridge gave way 1111
der the weight ot the cavalry. ihe
enemy in the mean time brought up
[heir main force, and their cannon
began to play 011 the mill-dam which
we had to pals. Two battalions, un-
Col. Grochowiki and Capr. Bronikow
ski, were thus left expol'ed to a furi
ous attack, after a 1110 ft gallant relilt
ance, having loft 200 infantry, and a
bout 50 cavalryâthe remainder re
treated through the water, having
firft funk their cannon. We loft in
this action x major and 8 officers kill
ed, and 2 milling.
The main army finding the fortifi
cations at Volonna untenable, on the
1 7th inft. marched lowards Zielime,
where, being reinforced by some
troops fromZanflaw, it halted to give
battle to the enemy. They footi ap
peared, confilting of about 8000 ca
valry, 9000 infantry, and 24 pieces
of cannon. The action began with
1 he greatest fury, and continued from
7 o'clock in the morning till five in
the afternoon, when the enemy was
obliged to retreat, leaving 11s the field
of battle, whereon having rested for
two hours,our army inarched toZanl
law, near which it is now encamped.
We cannot yet ascertain our lossâ
it appears to be about 800 infantry,
and 300 borfe ; and that of the ene
my about 4000. The Ruffian forces,
when joined, under Gen. Kocholki,
we hear, will be three times more nu
merous than ours, to which we have
only our courage and patiioiifm to
oppose.
LISLE, July 3
The army is eftablilhing itfelf at
Fama and at Mauldeânothing re
markable si.ice the affair of Couitray

July 7. The progress of the Belgic
patriots seems at a Hand ; the pre
parations for the equipment of a
number who are still unclothed, are
deferred, and they are in 2 Hate of
general dejection.
Immediately after the evacuation
of Courtray and Menin, the Aulhi
ans penetrated into all their former
stations, though it was night, and o
vertook a party of about fifty of the
Belgic legion, who had not timely no
tice of the French retreat, being up
on guard at an out post. They fell
into the hands of the enemy, and next
day ten were hung on the public mar
ket place. The reft have probably
by this time experienced a similar
fate.
It is not yet known whether any
part of Marlhal Lucklier's army will
relume the pofiiion near this city,
but notice has been given to the pea
fa in s not to till the ground formerly
occupied.
Deserters from the Auftrians are
constantly coming in ; ami our pa
troles, sent out to scour the country
at night, commonly return with pri
foners.
PARIS, July J.
if any thing can save us from im

parties, which is so great, that among
twenty persons, we scarce find two

quently no one party can judge where
to fix a point of union. The number
ot leifis in politics seem to be as great
as that which pievails in religion,

violent, and intolerant.

" We approach the famous epoch

it only permits the renewal of the

ously, That all thoi'e members who
both abjured and execrated a repub

whole Aflembiy immediately arose,
and solemnly declared, they never
would fuffer, either by tlie introduc
tion of the republican system, or by
the eftablilhment of two honfes,
any alteration whatever in the cou
ftitiuion. A geneval cry of union
followed diretftly. The members who

received them with open arms, and
in their turn went and placed thern
felves on the benches on the left

Scarcely had t'uey clone this, when the ap

He was accompanied by his ministers, and plac

THE PRESIDENT'S REPLY.
" Sire,

It is a dreadful epoch for its enemies, hence
forth the nation is invincible. In vain tyrants
conspire against liberty."
Both tbefe speeches were received with the
loudest applause.
The King made Tome efforts to answer, hut
was so much aflfe<sted that he could only fay, in
a tone which indicated the utmost emotion,
44 The pleasure which I feel is delicious." He
then retired, accompanied by a deputation, and
the fitting rose, amidst the acclamations of Vive

Philadelphia, Sept. 8.
ABSTRACT of EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE.
By the English papers it appears that on the
19th and 20th June, ail iminenfe body of the
people of Paris went to the Tiiuilleries, and
demanded of the King that he should fan ft ion
the two decrees of the National Assembly ; one
for the expulsion of the nonjuring and refrac
orv clergy.; the other for forming a camp of
twenty thousand men in the environs of Paris.
The mob on the 20th June was supposed to con
f;ft of 100,000 personsâthey committed great
! excesses, and at length broke into the King'
apartment. In the confufion a bayonet was
aimed at the King, but the stroke was parried
by the. interference of one of the National
Guards. The King, by address and great pre
sence of mind, evaded a compliance with the
demandâand by subsequent accounts, it feenv;
that thole decrees have not received his appro
bation.âThe tranfa&ions of the 20th of June,
cau'ed a considerable ferment in the army 011
the frontiers, particularly that division under
the command of M. dela Fayette. A petition
t.o the National Aifembly was the coniequence,
praying for an abolition of all the Club^âthis
was carried to Paris by M. de la Fayette, and
P'efented to the AfTembly. Violent debates
took place on the occasion, in which the most
i'evere and pointed ftri&ures were made on the
cond 116 VofM. La Fayette. He was compared
to Julius Csefar, Oliver Cromwell, &c. and
charged with dilating laws to the country at
the head of an army. The result of the debate
was a spirited decree, declaring that military
officers, commanders, &rc. should not petition
the Legislature on any fubjett except those im
mediately relating to the army. The Jacobins
appear to have been greatly exasperated at the
condutt of M. de la Fayetteâan attempt was
made to burn him in effigy, which was prevented
by the interposition of the National Guards. A
motion was made in the AlTeinbly to fend M. de
!a Fayette to Orleans as a prisonerâthis how
ever did not obtainâand without effecting his
he left Paris and rejoined the army.
A letter i- publilhed, fa id to be from the Kin.e
of" Pnil'ia to the King of Polandâin which he
fa. â u Whatever be the frienclfl 1 â  that X 1-ave

the Emp.r fs of ftuflia, and to explain myfelf at

strive to reconcile the different interests, and
to agree on measures capable of restoring to
Poland its tranquility." The EngliJli of all this
is y that J Poland will bow the neik, dejputjm will re
place the yoke which they have thrown off.
Official accounts of the fuccel's of the Britifli
arms in India, had arrived in Englandâreceiv
ed over land via Constantinople.
Jljnke Ferdinand of Erunfwick died at Brunf
the 3d of July, of an apoplexy.
mM'he National Affembjy having declared by a
i fclic ast that the nation is in dangerâan ad-
ifs to the people, and another to the army,
Jras been published by their order; in which they
'all upon both, by every confederation that can
move freemen to such exertions, as may diiap
point their enemies and preserve the Constitu
tion.âA letter from the King to the Alfembly,
on the ioth July, informed them that all the Mi
nisters in their resignations. M. De
mourier, late Minister of War, had gone 10 Va
lenciennes. âGreat difolders took place in the
galleries on the evening of the ioth. The mob
hiflTed, hooted and even menaced the Alfembly.
Voices were heard calling out, u Get you gone,
get you goneâyour labors are not worth your
eighteen francs a dayÂ«"âThe Piefident order
ed the guard to restore order in the galleriesâ
which, after forne difficulty, was effected.â-The
Ministers, in the account which they gave in of
the state of the kingdom, fay, that the frontiers
would soon be attacked by about 200, 000 men,
to which France had about 248,000 to opposeâ
that the King of Sardinia might be reckoned*
among her foes âand that fbe had not a single
ally, except America, from whom nothing could
be expected, but supplies for her Colonics.
The grand federative meeting took place in
the Champs de Mars on the 14th July, and the
clay pal Ted without any disagreeable occurrence
whateverâthe procerfions of the citizens, the
military, &c. were splendidâThe King and
lloyal Family attended on the eccafior.âwhen
he renewed the oath to support the Constitution.
The Englifli papers further fay, that the pro
vince of Holland, and the city of Amsterdam,
had agreed to join Austria and Pruflla against
Franceâand it was expected that the reil of the
provinces would do the fame.âMeaiurcs are
pursuing to have M. I'Abbe Mauryelertcd Bishop
of Liege Adivifion of Poland between Austria,
Ruflia & Prussia, & the King, is talked ofâwho i:
tobeprefented with the smallest part. âThe King
of Hungarv has ordered prayers to be put up in His
dominionsfor fuccefsagainft tLeFrench. âGreat
insubordination had prevailed in the French ar
mies, to which may be attributed the partial
'needles gained over them by the Auftrians j
but since the French Generals have got their
troops into better order, they have Â£hewn them
selves. in fcveral instances more than a match
for their enemies.âThe command of M. Je la
Fayette's division of the army, devolved on M.
d'Hangeft, during the journey of the former to
Paris.
M. Petliion, the Mayor, has publilhed obser
vations on the events of the 2oth June. He
attributes all to mere accident. The Mayor,
it appears had been suspendedâbut a decree of
the National Aflembly had restored him to the
exercise of his fun&ions.âAn Englifli paper
fays, M. de la Fayette's army may yet save the
French nation from deftru&ionânot by oppos
ing the Auftrians, nor by fighting the Pruflians,
but by marching to Paris, and in conjunction
with the National Guards, restoring the Crown
to its dignity, and the people to their lenses.â
The Erg lifh Royal ijis appear anxious Jor a second Gen.
Monk to Jhew himjelj in France.
A writer in the Pittsburgh Gazette of last Satur
day, speaking of the Excise Law, laysâ" I con
gratulate the Western Counties, of which I am an
inhabitant, that the opposition to the law is on thr
decreafe âlast year it appeared as a committee
chosen by a number of people in the different
Counties, and came forward with some kind of
powers ; this year it was not even the ghost of a
committee, only a few persons assembled, notwiih
ftanding a public invitation was given, end thofc
but from two Counties; they endeavored to be
come refpedable by attempting to drag in bye
danders, but in vain ; they were abashed (their
only merit!) and adjourned to a more obiciirr

Exlrafl of a letterfrom C*pe-Vra.ncoii y dated Aug. 18.
u The beginning,of this week a dispute arose
between a white man and a mulatto, about a
negro girl, when the former killed the latter.
The town was immediately alarmedâfive
whites were ioftantlv killed and three wounded,
and one mulatto. Thus the affair ended ; but
as long as a mulatto remains in the island, so
longwiQ these disturbances be: for the lower claf
of whites are very much ex:\fperated agtfinfi
them on account of their liberr . âThe negrcc-,
almost every night let fire to tie young canes,
and do as they pJeafeâ-being in quiet pfclieilrori
of all the country around the Cape."
Lad Monday arrived the Hoop Sally, Capt.
Ridgeway, t'rom Cape-Francois.
Letters by this veflel dated the JBth August
mention, that they had accounts from Aux-
Caye.t, that it was destroyed by fire, that the
negroes had beat the white people in an engage
ment, killed about 300 of them, and took their
Cannon : âThe fsme letters mention that dis
turbances had begun in the Cape between the
mulattoes and whites, that there were several
lives lofi ; that the negroes were in arms, and
going 011 with as much fury as formerly ; that
an embargo was laid at the Cape, that the vef
(elswere afraid to land their cargoes, as both
lives and property in the city were considered
as in great danger.

PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION,
An ELEGANT FDITWN of the
SACRED SCRIPTURES
Of the OLD and NEW TESTAMENTS, with the
Apocrypha,'
Oil a very large and beantiful new Type, andJuperjint
Paper.
THE great importance of the Holy Scriptures,
imcrcfting to every individual; the divine excel
lence of its do&rines and precepts, and the beauty
and sublimity of its passages, have so long made it
capital obje& of attentioo, as 10 preclude occa
sion or opportunity for eulogium.
The piety or entrrprize of individuals has pre
fcnted this invaluable book to the public in a va
riety of forms ; in some editions it has been highly
cmbcllifhed with superb engravings, which have
greatly enhanced its price ; in others it has been
accompanied with voluminous commentaries,
which neceflarily encreafed the size; while a va
riety of plain cheap copies have generally diffufed
the knowledge of the Scripture, and made the
purchase ealy to every class.
Without wifning in the smallest degree to leflen
the merits of the various editions, whether plain
or ornamented, which the public are already in
poffeflion of, it is pertinent to remark, that very
many readers of taste and judgment have exprefled
a wiih for a Familv Bible unencumbered with ad
ditions. There still appears room for another
edition on a beautiful new type, superior in size
and elegance to any bible that has yet been printed
in the Englilh language, arid which, leaving the
adventitious circumstances of ornament or com
ment, may exhibit the Oracles oj God in their na
tive limplicity.
SPECIMEN OF THE TYPE.
5 And God said,
d Let there be light: and
there, was light.
With refpe&ful fubmiflfion to the judgment and
candour of the public, the following proposals arc
offered :
I. The woikfhallbc printed with the gieatcft
fidelity and attention to corre&nefs both in the
text and marginal references, on a fuperfine Paper
made on purpole, with an elegant new Type calt
for the woik of the size of the above Specimen.
11. The woik will be comprised in twenty
number?, nuking two elegant volumes in Folio;
to be furnifhed to fubfciibers at one dollar each
number. To prevent any complaints ot v dÂ«t of
punttuality, no pÂ«rt of the work will be deh\crc<*
unless paid for.
111. The fir ft: number, containing sixty folit>
pages, elegantly printed, will be furnifhed on the
fiilt Saturday of July next, when fubferibers
to pay the price of the firft and lecond numbers*
and the price df one number to be always in ad
