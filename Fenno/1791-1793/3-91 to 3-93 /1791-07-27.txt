Mr. Paine s pnnciple, and it is the real around
upon which he prefers the French conflnution

that the Engl,ft conflitution is bad, because un

enarted and are not yet repealed. And he con
cludes that the French conflitution is excellent
because the un.verfal freedom of the chace, and'
the univei sal freedom of trade are placed beyond
the controul of their legislature But the pre

have the power of making game Jaws for the

Mi. laine has not however, grounded liis pre
fe,encetothe French conftitutiun, upon truth, in
tins inuance any more tiian in the other. 7he
principle of excluding placemen, pensioners,
and executive officers from the national reprefen
tationi is acknowledged by the laws under the
knglifh conftuution, as well as in that of France.
1 ne only pofnble advantage which the French
can pretend to, is, that they have been more
lucceisful in its application. Mr. Paine might
if V r f i K Was not luffic 'ently extended by
the English laws, and that it was by the French â¢
and his opinion would have had its weight; bu[
this would not answer his purpose : The French
confhtutioii must at all events have a triumph;
and a system foodious as the. English government
was not entitled to the benefits of common truth
and jultice. There are however several adls of
Parliament, expressly excluding a great variety
of placemen, peniioners and officers dependent
upon the executive authority, from holding feats
in the house of commons. With refpedt to pen
-11 one is their principle is more equitable than the
total exclusion of the h rench. Every perf'on hold
ing a pension at the pleasure of the liing, or for
a term of years is excluded, because fucli a man
may be too liable to be under the influence of
the executive power; but if a man has received
a pension for hfe, as a reward for services ren
dered his country, a pension which carries no
dependence, and which can have no effect upon

credit to the sincerity of the Monarch. His Ma

MR. FOX AND MR. BURKE.
WE know not which to admire 1110 ft : The
manly manner in which Mr. Fox solicited the
continuance of Mr. Burke's friendfiiip, or the
unshaken steadiness which accompanied the lat
ter gentleman's noble defence of his principles.
In the one, the feelings of the heart, for a mo
ment quelled the ftubborntiefs of an opinion
founded 011 the conviction of a ripened and en
larged mind. In the other, every private at
tachment, and every friendfliip that can be dear
to man, were facrificed with Roman firinnefs to
support the Constitution of his country. Each
thought himfelfin the right, and each conceived
that he was arguing for tlie Public Good. Mr.
Fox has long been known to profefs,a strong af
fetftion for more of the republican system in our
Government than Mr. Burke would ever bring
his judgment to approve. The former conceives
that there is a natural right in man to be free ;
the latter thinks that such freedom would be
subversive of all the blessings which we at pre
sent enjoy. Mr. Fox would narrow the limitsot
monarchy, and extend the liberty of the people.
Mr. Burke would neither abridge the one nor
enlarge the other. On these topics they have
'often difFered in private ; but as there was no
event to prove who was right, the argument ne
ver rose to any thing more than the convivial
diflertations of the table. But the French Revo
lution had no sooner happened, than each seized
upon it as a strong tettimony to prove the julhce
of his own opinion. Mr. Fox conceiving it to
be a circumstance which must give the moll glo
rious blessings to France ; Mr. Burke a (let ting
that it was the 1110 ft difgraceful and deftrudtue
event that could ever happen to an empire. t
was now 110 longer a difcourle 011 a fpecuiatne

Thursday, there was a very numerous and re
fpe<slable meeting of the Society for Propagating
( hriltian Knowledge. Sir William Forbes, of
Pitfligo, Bart, in the Chair. This extraordinary
meeting was called to announce the very great
and princcly donation of Ten Thousand Pounds
in the f per cent Annuities. The hiltory of the
corrcfpondence, which, for several months, has
been carrying on upon that interesting btifinefs
was dated at length, from which it appeared,
that their benefactor, with a delicacy of mind,
not less singular than the extent of his benefi
cence, had taken the moll effectual measures to
prevent the discovery of his name, and feenied
]>articularly anxious to remain concealed. The
members agreed that however much their own
gratitude might prompt them to the measure,
they were so far bound in duty, to consult the
feelings of their unknown benefactor, as to a
void publishing an acknowledgment of his boun
ty in the newspapersâ but resolved, that a nar
rative of the circumstances attending this great
event, so far as they should find themselves at
liberty at the time, shall be laid before the pub
lic, in the appendix to the next anniversary ser
mon to be preached before the society, and print
ed as nfual. In the mean time, it was proposed,
and as heartily as unanimously agreed to, that
two gentlemen, the friends of the donor, who
have been hitherto inftrinnental in carrying in
to execution this great and good work, the one,
the truflee to whom the sum is conveyed for the
benefit of the Society, the other a clergyman, by
whom the ncceffary correspondence was carried
on, and both men of refpetfable characters,
/hould, without waiting for usual forms, be im
mediately admitted members of the Society ;
and that the Earl of Leven, the Prcfident, be re
quested to fend along with diplomas of their ad
mission, letters to each of these gentlemen, ex
preflive of the grateful sentiments of the Society
upon this occasion.
B O S T O N, July 13.
FROM A CORRESPONDENT
The papers of late have teemed with abuse of the Vice Pr e
siden r. He is confulered the author of " Publicola"âthough
I do not suppose lie is ; but if that was the cafe, the fentimenis I
conceive are purely republican ; and such as would do honor to
any man whatever, As might have been expe&ed, there are
many replies, but few or no anfwcrs. It would be an abomina
ble-thing in the view of some men, should the people more full)
know the truth of the cafe, which is, that the Vice Pr esident
of the United States is one of the most perfett and confijlent Re
publicans in America, and this is so abundantly apparent from
his works, that I do not believe they were ever read by any per
lon with candor and attention, who was not convinced of the
faÂ£h
Hence the replies to PuhlicoU, which go on the above supposi
tion, instead ot attempting to answer the nervous reasonings the)
contain, catch at draws, or abound in ribaldry and abuse. â Any
man who presumes to think for himfelf, will have his opinions
controvertedâand I trufta free press will forever exist in America.
No man has made a better use of one than Mr. Adamsâand I
believe there is not a greater tricrid to free difcuflion than he is.
Happy for his pic-sent peace of mind, and future fame, though
mip-eprefemation raay cloud the public eye for a time in refpeft
to his principles (for it is too much the cafe that people will not
read for themselves) yet the utmost efforts of envy or malice can
not reach his character. His honor and integrity are unimpeacha
bleâand as to his ABt I tTiEi they cannot be steadily contemplated
by one of his opponents âtheir optics' arc not competent to the
exeriion.
The attack from a Western Paper is absolutely a compliment
to the republican character of the Vice President. The
quotations from his works were felefted by the eye of picjudice.
as the most exceptionableâthose very quotations trace every thing
in government froin the people.âAnd as to the charges, they are
unsupported by any quotation or reference whatever, âneither
are they deduflions from any previous remarks that had been
made.
It would be an Herculean talk to attempt to refute his system.
I hardly expect that it will ever be undertaken. The experi
ence of mankind for thousands of years, without an exception,
mud exhibit a basis that cannot be overthrown ; and every man of
modesty, however great his .abilities, will pause before he at
tempts to refute the republican principles laid down in the Defence
of the American Conjlitutions.
Bkaintree, July 7, 1-791
Monday last being the fifteenth anniversary of American Inde
pendence, the fame was celebrated in this town wiih everv mark

the purpose by Mr. John Lathrop of Boston.)
2d. The Vice-President, and Congress of the United Statesâ
(three cheers.)
3d. Ihe Governor and Commonwealth of Maflachufettsâ

Mav the revolution ot France cause a political fire, whose efful
gence shall irradiare the nationsÂ«which arc now wrapt in the gloom
oflbvery; and whose heat (hall dissolve the chains with which
the v:ctims of tyranny arc bound.

-A hill laying on the river, near Weymouth, which affords a beauti-
Jul prefbefl of the harbour y and adjacctit towns.

13th. The Memory of those Patriot Heroes who fell in the
Cause of their Country.
14th. May we never forget those whpfe exertions procured the
Independence of America; and may \ve never abuse our Liberty
to lioentioufnefs.
The Vice-Prejident then arose, and gave the following toajlâ
May every Citizen be a Soldier, and every Soldier a Citizen.â
(three cheers)
After which the company retired, each one highly gratified
with the performance of the day, which was condu&ed with great
propriety,,and without the occurrence of any accident that might
allay the joy so conspicuous in every countenance.
GEORGEtTOW X, July 16.
Ext raft of a letter from a gertUman in Philadelphia, to his friend in
ji.:. i J-i- j rr..~
this town, dated July 10.
" Inclosed you will receivc Mr. Adams's Letters on the American
Revolution. His writings of the date of thcfe letters and prior to
them, breathe different sentiments from those that now flow from
the pen of Publicolaâand it is unfortunate to his cause that they
rife up in judgment against him. It is truly astonishing that the
man who thundered fortii the inspiration of liberty, and damped
his country with independence in the year 1776, should have so far
forgotten himfelf, or the principles of her divine oracles, as to
espouse the detestable cause of hereditary arift'ocracyâand to em
ploy those talents and time, that should be devoted to his country,
in Supporting the principles of a government that affects to hold
ours in the utmost contempt."
N Â£ W- Y O R K, July 22.
If the esteem and refpeft of the people, for those men, whose
talents and abilities are uniformly devoted to the fcrvice of their
country, and who have proved eminently ufeful to the public,
ought ever to be manifefted, every man would think them deserv
edly bestowed on the Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States. A just sense of his merit, and of the benefits which the
agriculture, commerce and manufaÂ£hires of this country, have de
rived from his labours, impelled the Corporation of the Chamber of
Commerce, of this city, to give an entertainment on Wednesday last,
at the City Tavern, to that worthy Statesman, at which the follow
ing toasts were given : '
lft. The United States.
2d. The Piefident.
3d. The Vice-President and Senate of the United States.
4th. The Governor and State of New-York.
sth. The Judiciary of the United States.
6th. All foreign powers in friendlhip with the United States.
7th. May America be grateful to those who have diflinguiihed
themselves in forming the present government.
B.h. May the Merchants of America ever be foremoft in support
of the laws of their country.
9th. May the Treasury of the United States always be adequate
to the exigencies of the nation.
10th. May Agriculture and Manufactures incrcafe, and open
new sources of Commerce.
11th. May a flourifhing Commerce amply compensate the Huf.
bandman and Manufa&urers' toil.
12th. The Arts and Sciencesâmay they continue to be im
proved and cultivated.
13th. The rising generationâmay they be virtuous and happy.
14th. Oblivion to all local prejudices*,

FROM AN ENGLISH PAPER.
The following Verses' were ordered by the late
Mrs. Turner, of Woolwich, to be laid upon
her Husband's writing desk a few days before
her death, and may prove acceptable to the
admirers of that Lady's compositions : â
A HYMN.
-1- HROUGH all the various fiiifting scene,
Of life's mistaken ill or good :
Thy hand, O God ! condu&s unseen,
The beautiful viciflitude;
He portions with paternal care,
Howe'er unjustly we complain ;
To each their neceflary (hare,
Of joy and sorrowâhealth or pain.
Trust we to youth, or friends, or pow'r,
Fix we our feet on Fortune's ball ;
When mod fccure, the coming hour,
If He fees fit, may blast them all.
When lowest funk with grief or shame,
Gorg'd with affliÂ£tion*s bitter cup ;
Loft to relations, friends, and fame,
His pow'rful hand can raise thee up.
His mighty consolations cheer,
His smiles erect th' affli&ed head :
His hand can wipe away the tear
That secret wets the wiaow'd bed
Philadelphia, July 27.
011 Friday last the {hip Commerce, Capt. Jones,
arrived here in 45 days from Exeter, England.
â Accounts by this veflel are to the full: June.
1 hey inform, T hat the Turks have gained an
advantage over the Ruffians, the Grand Vizir
having obliged them to raise the siege of Zacka
nali, with the loss of 700 men, and '36 officers
killed, beftdes many prisoners, and 19 pieces of
cannon taken, with all the veflels which the
Ruffians had allembled at the place. On the
2 5 ta ' v -'-y the trial of Mr. Haitings recommenced
in the House of Lords.âAccounts are received
of the arrival at Botany Bay of the transports
with a great number of conviifts The press
continues with unabated vigor ; the bounty to
lea men extended to the 30th JuneâThe'Na
tional Allembly have resolved, that the members
of one legislature may be eleifted in a fubfecjuent
one, but not without an inteval of two years
which will induce the necessity of an entire change
at every general election.âThe Lotd Bishop of
Durham, brother to the Chancellor Lord Tliur
lovv, died the 25th May, after a long and severe
illness A meflenger from Petersburg has

brought: dispatches to the Ruffian Ambaflador in
London, âthey state, that the Empress will noc
deviate from the plan she lias proposed. to the
Turks for making peace ; flie is preparing for
making a resolute defence, in cafe (he should be
attacked by a British fleCt.â Hopes are however
entertained of a peace, as itisfaid the Turks are
now willing to acci.de to the terms offered by the
Empress, viz. That Oczakow and its dependen
cies should be ceded to Russia.âFrom these, and
other circuinltances, it is generally supposed
that the present British armaments will not be
brought into atftion. The Eriglifh nation ap
pears averse from a war with Rullia, aud the ad
ministration will not precipitately adt counter to
the general sense of the people. The English
fleet is about three-fourths manned, and consists
of fail of the line, besides smaller ships.-
The late surprizing revolution in Poland, is a
triumph ofrealon and benevolence overcivilarid

doned as in a momentâand the tiers etat admit

participation of the legislative and executive
powers of government. âand declared, eligible
to any office civil, military or eccleliaftical.
Mr. Pitt was thirty-two years old on the 28th of

in Constantinople ; the people are clamorous for
peace; the Sultan persists in continuing the war.
Several fires have taken place, by one of which
an entire quarter of the city was consumedâthe
loss is estimated at twenty-five millions of piastres.
âNegociations are carrying on in all the North
ern kingdoms, the designs of which appear to be
much confufed.âReligious liberality begins to
appear even in Spainâthe English papers men
tion in handsome terms an instance of thift libe
rality at Alicant, on the death of a Mrs. Fall, who
was buried according to the rites of the Proteltaat
church, and in the Proteflant burying ground.â
Some intimation is given of a design to celebrate
the anniversary of the French Revolution in
COMMUNICATIONS.
Ten cities, it is said, contended for the honor of having been
the birth place of Homer; but this contention, at the distance of
more than twenty centuries, is found to have been about a non
entity. A modern French critic has discovered that no such per
son as Homer ever existed ! âWhat illusions are played off upon
the feelings of mankindâhow has their sympathy been abused by
reading such strains as the following :
" Can all the -wreaths that crown'd his head )
" Compensate now to Homer dead,
" The living Homer's want of bread ?
Another modern discovery is, that Dean Swift did not write
the Tale of a Tub. We are not informed as to the circumstances
which led to this discovery, but one obvious remark is obtruded
on the mind, not very favorable to the reputation of the Dean,
supposing the discovery to be well founded, and that is, the impo
sition which he put on mankind while living, and, owing to his
incorrigible diflionefty, has been continued ever since his decease.
Several pettv robberies have been committed on the Fame of Shake
speare ; and we may expect every day to hear that Milton was not
the author of Paradise Lojl.
But theaffuranceoffome wonderfully sagacious modern politicians
in their modern discoveries, exceeds all former examples. The pa
triots of America, whose wisdom and valor is emancipating the
old world as it has already the new, have in a recent party publica
tion been stripped of their laurels and their honors decreed them
by a grateful country . -Their tiiumphs in the field, and that con
stitution which was the result of their combined wisdom, " were
the produ&ions of chaia&ers which will never enjoy the historical
fame thereof." A most modest attempt truly to depreciate in the
eyes of their countrymen, the patriots of America. If this is not
Toryism, it is something that bears a strong resemblance to it.

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful situation is not surpassed, if equalled by any ; be

to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by realon of the flats, this wharf is necefiarily extended 10 the
channel, where ships can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the most extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3-4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all classes of people, for
the success of ihis enterprize, together with the very great advan
tage which this Icheme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet publilhed in
Ameriea) induce the managers to believe the tickets will meet with
a speedy sale.
The drawing will positively commence at the State-House, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be published, and the prizes
paid on demand, by the managers. Those prizes notcalled for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
