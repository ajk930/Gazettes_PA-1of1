FROM THE. AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER
(CONCLUDED.)
Paris, May 3, 1788.
" "TT7HILE there, (meaning Amsterdam) I
VV endeavored to get as well as I could
into the state of national credit there; for al
though I am an enemy to uling our credit, but
under absolute necelTity, yet the poflelling-a
good credit I consider as indifpenfibJe in the pre
sent fyftetn of carrying on war. The exiftcnce
of a nation having no credit, is always preca
rious."
" I inicrreW rejoice at the acceptance oi our
new constitution by nine states. It is a good
canvass on which lome strokes only want re
touching. What these are, I think are fuffici
ently manifefted by the general voice from north
to south, which calls for a bill of rights. It
seems pretty generally understood that this
Ihould go to juries, habeas corpus, standing ar
mies, printing, religion, and monopolies. I
conceive there may be difficulty, in finding ge
neral modifications of these, luited to the habits
of all the states. But if such cannot be found,
then it is better to eftabliih trials by jury, the
right of habeas coi-pu , freedom of the press and
freedom of religion, in all caJes, and to
standing armies in time of peace, and monopo
lies in all cases, than not do it in any. The
few cases wherein these things may do evil,
cannot be weighed against the multitude where
in the want of them will do evil. In disputes
between a foreigner and a native, a trial by
jury may be improper; but if this exception
cannot be agreed to, the remedy will be to mo
del the jury by giving the medietas linguae ill
civil, as well as criminal cases. Why futpeird
the habeas corpus in infurreftions and rebellions?
The parties who may be arretted, may be char
ged instantly with a well defined crime: ofcourfe
the judge will remand them; if the public fat'ety
requires that the government Ihould have a man
imprisoned on less probable testimony, in tho e
than in other emergencies, let him be taken and
tried, retaken and retried, while the ner JTc
continues, only giving him redress again!" 1
government for damages. Examine the '
of England, fee how few cases of the ft
of the habeas corpus law have been ' Li../ .
that fufpenlion. They have been cit : r<
treasons, wherein the parties i. 'ght "J*'Â®
have been charged at once, or : 1 â  pie/ e S lct

good, that operation is now beio - haftilA.
and the minds of the nation almoii. â ;> 1 -VÂ» r ;fsf e
live under its constant suspension. Adti*
tion that the federal government wil â â  e \ras
strain the prelTes from printing any ti> t
please, will not take away the liability -i tii,
printers for falfe facts printed. The di. Jura
tion that religious faith (hall be unpum'iw
does not give impunity to criminal a<fts di<sla:ed
by religious error. The faying there lhall le
no monopolies, lessens the incitements to inge
nuity, which is spurred 011 by the hope of a 1, o
nopoly for a limitted time, as of 14 years : bl
the benefit, even of limitted monopolies, is too
doubtful to be opposed to that of their *fl
suspension. If no check can be found to keep
the number of standing troops within fats
bounds, while they are tolerated as far as neccf
fary, abandon them altogether; discipline well
the militia, and guard the magazines witn them.
More than magazine guards will be useless if
few, and dangerous if many. No European n-a
tjon can ever fend against us fucli a regular ar
my as we need fear, and it is hard if our militia
are not equal to those of Canada or Florida,
My idea then is, that tho' proper exceptions to
these general rules are desirable, and probably
pra&icable, yet if the exceptions cannot be
agreed on, the eftablilhment of the rules in all
cases will do ill in very few. I hope therefore
a bill of rights will be formed to guard the pe j
ple against: the federal government, as they are
already guarded against their state governments
in most instances. The abandoning the princi
ple of necessary rotation in the ienate has, I fee,
been disapproved by many; in the cafe of the
president by rone. I readily therefore suppose
my opinion wrong when opposed by the majo
rity, ars in the former instance, and the totality
in the latter. In this, however, I lhould have
done it with more complete fatisfa<stion, had we
all judged from the fame position."
Paris, Nov. 18, s;88.
" As to the bill of rights however 1 still think
it Ihould be added, and 1 am glad to fee that
three states have at length considered the perpe
tual re-eligibility of the president, as an article
which ihould be amended. I iho" M â-âirecate

li I cannot refrain from making short an
swers to the objections which your letter states
to have been raised. I. That the rights in
question are reserved by the manner in which
the federal powers are granted. Answer, a
constitutive ast may certainly befo formed ar> to
need no declaration of rights. The adt itfelf
lias the force of a declaration as far as it goes;
and if it goes to all material points, nothing
more is wanting. In the draught of a cdnftitu
tion which I had once a thought of propoling in
Virginia, and printed afterwards, I endeavored
to reach all the great objects of public liberty,
and did not mean to add a declaration of rights.
Probably the object was imperfectly executed ;
but the deficiencies would have been fnpplied
by others in the course of discussion. But in a
constitutive a<st, which leaves foine precious ar
tides unnoticed, and raises implications againfr
others, a declaration of rights becomes necef-
Jary by way of supplement. This is the cafe of
our new federal constitution. This inftmment
forms us into one state, as to certain ohjefrs
and gives us a legislative and executive body
for these objects it fliould therefore guard us
against their abuses of power within the field
submitted to them. 2. A positive declaration
of some ellential rights could not be obtained in
the requisite latitude. Answer, if we cannot
secure all our rights, let us lecure what we can.
3. The liinitted powers of the federal govern
ment, and jealousy of the fubord nate govern
ments, afford a security which exists in no other
instance. Answer, the firft member of this
seems resolvable into the firft objection before
stated. The jealousy of the subordinate go
vernments is a precious reliance ; but ob/erve
that those governments are only agents. Thev
must have principles furnifhed them whereon
to found their opposition. The declaration of
rights will be the text whereby they will try all
the acts of the federal government; 'n this view
it will be necefTary to the federal government
also : as by the fame text, they may try the op
position of the subordinate governments. 4. sEx
perience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights.
True ; but though it is not absolutely efficaci
ous under all circumstances, it is of yeat po
tency always, and rarely inefficacious. A brace
the more will often keep up the building which
would have fallen with that brace the less. There
is a remarkable difference between the charac
ters of the inconveniences which attend a de
claration of rights, and those which attend the
want of it. The inconveniences of the decla
ration are, that it may cramp government in
its ufeful exertions; but the evil of this is short
lived, moderate, and reparable. The inconve
niences of the want of a declaration, are per
manent, afflicting, and irreparable ; they are
in a constant progreflion from bad to worse. I
know there are some among us who would now
establish a monarchy, but they are inconsidera
ble in number and weight of chara&er. The
nfing race are all republicans. We were edu
catad in 1 oyalifm . no wonder if some of us re
tain that idolatry still. Our young people are
educated in republicanism : an apoftacy from
that to royalifm is unprecedented and impofli-
I am much pleased with the profpeft that
1 . 'aration of rights will be added ; and hope
iii be done in that way which will not en
dangc *be whole frame of the government, o.
any eflential part of it."

gentleman Una" to those points. j
The facts which have been established e'ear
lv demonftiate, that in the form in which it is
made, the charge is well founded.
If Mr. jeffertbn's opposition to the funding!
fyltem, to tjie bank, and to the other meafurcs
which are connected with the adminiftjjitjqn of
the national finances had ceased, when thole
measures had received the fanftion of law ; no
thing more cou'd have been laid, than, that he
had tranfgrefled the rules of official decorum,
in entering the lifts against the head of another
department (between whom and himfelf, there
was a reciprocal duty to cultivate harmony)
that he had been culpable in pursuing a line of
conduct, which was calculated to Tow tke feeds
of discord in the executive branch of the go
vernment, in the infaricy of its existence.
But when his opposition extended beyond
that point; when it was apparent, that he wish
ed to render odims, and of course to subvert (for
in a popular government these are convertible
terms) all those deliberate and folenin arts of
the legislature, which had become the pillars of
the public credit, his conduct deserved to be re
garded with a still severer eye.
Whatever differences of opinion may have
preceded those a<stsâhowever exceptionable
particular features in them may have appeared
to certain characters, there is no enlightened
nor discreet citizen but must agree, that they
ought now to remain uvdijiurbed, To set afloat
the funding system, after the faith of the nation
has been so deliberately and solemnly pledged to
itâafter such numerous and extensive aliena
tions of property for full value have been made
under its fan (stionâwith adequate revenues,
littleburthenfome to the peopleâin a time of
profound peace*âwith not even the shadow of
any public neceflityâon no better ground than
that of theoretical and paradoxical dogmas
would be one of the most wanton and flagitious
arts, that ever stained the annals of a civilized
nation.
Yet positions tending to that (jifgraceful re
sult have been maintained in public discourses,
by individuals known to be devoted to the Se
cretary of State ; and have been privately
smiled upon as profound discoveries in political
science.
"\et the less discreet, though not least impor
tant partizans of that officer, talk familiarly of
undoing the funding system as a meritorious
work : Yet his Gazette (which may fairly be
regarded as the mirror ol his views) after hav
ing labored for months to make it an object of
popular detestation, has at length told us in
plain and triumphant terms, that "the funding
fvftcm has had its day and very clearly, if
not expressly, that it is the object of the party
to overthrow it.
The American, then, has iuftly, and from
fufficient data, inferred, that Mr. Jefferfon's
politics, whatever may be the motives of them,
tend to national disunion, infignificance, difor
er and discredit. That the fubverlion of the
tunding system would producenationaldifcredit,
proves itfelf. Loss of credit, the reason being
. Â® ra , me ' mu(l attend nations, as well as indi
viduals who voluntarily and without neceflity
violate their formal and poiitive engagements.
Infignificance and disorder, as applied to com
mumties, equally with individuals, are the na
tural offspring of a loss of credit, premeditated
ly and voluntarily incurred.
Disunion would not long lag behind. Sober
minded and virtuous men in every State would
all confidence in, and all lefnect for a go
vernment, which had betrayed so much levity
and mconftancy, so profligate a disregard to the
'tfto oj property, and to the obligations of good
* Their support would of course be so far
withdrawn or relaxed, as to leave it an easy
prey to its enemies. These comprize the ad
vocates for separate confederacies; the jea
lous partizans of unlimited sovereignty, in the
; tate governmentsâthe never to be satiated
lovers of innovation and changeâthe tribe of
pretended philosophers, but real fabricators of
chimeras and paradoxesâthe Catalines and
the Casfars of the community (a delcription of
men to be found in every republic) who leading
the dance to the tune of liberty without law,
endeavor to intoxicate the people with delicious
but poisonous draughts to render them theeafier
victims of their rapacious ambition : the vi
cious and the fanatical of every class who are
A^ e ' r ll r , the wi,lin E or the deluded followers
of those seducing and treacherous leaders.

Not to cfttf or trace those fool and peftifent
whispers, circulating thrWjh
the country, have, as far as was frra&icable,
contaminated some of its faireft and worthiefi
characters, an appeal to known circunfftances
will juftify the charge.
Some time since, there appeared in print cer
tain speculations, which have been construed
into an advocation of hereditary diftinftions in
government. These (whether with, or without
foundation, is to this moment matter of con
jeaure) were ascribed to a particular charac
terâpre-eminent for his early, intrepid, faith
ful, peri'evering and comprehensively tileful ser
vices to his countryâa man pure and unspot
ted in private life, a citizen having a high and
solid title to the esteem, the gratitude and the
confidence of his fellow-citizens.
The firft volume of the " Rights of man"
makes its appearanceâThe opportunity is ea
gerly seized, to answer the double purpose of
wounding a competitor, and of laying in an ad
ditional stock of popularity ; by alTociating and
circulating the name of Thomas Jefferfon, with
a popular production of a favorite writer, on a
favorite fubjeft.
For this purpose the Secretary of State fits
down and pens an epistle to a printer in the city
of Philadelphia, transmitting the work for re
publication, and exprefling his approbation of it
in a way, which we learn, from the preface of
that printer to his edition of the work, was cal
culated not only to do justice to the writings of
Mr. Paine, but to do honor to Mr. Jefferfon ;
iy diufling the mind to a contemplation of that
republican jirmnefs and democratic jimplicit) l , which
ought to endear him to every friend to the
" Rights of Man."
The letter, as we learn from the fame pre
face, contained the following passages : u I am
extremeiy pleased to find it will be reprinted
here, and that something is at length to be pub
licly said against the political which have
Iprnng up among us." I have no doubt our ci
tizens will rally a second time round the Jlandard
of common sense."
There was not a man in the United States,
acquainted with the insinuations, which had
been propagated, who did not instantly apply
the remarkâand the signal was so well under
stood by the partizans of the writer, that a ge
neral attack immediately commenced. The
newspapers in different States resounded with
inventive and scurrility against the patriot, who
was marked out as the object of persecution,
and if poflible of degradation.
Under certain circumstances general expres
sions designate a person or an object as clearly
as an indication of it by name. So it happened
in the prelent cafe. The Javelin went direct
ly to its destination.
But it was quickly perceived, that discerning
and refpeftable men disapproved the step. It
was of consequence to endeavor to maintain
their good opinion.âProtestations, and excuses
as frivolous as awkward were multiplied to veil
the real design.
u The gentleman alluded to, never once en
tered into the mind ! It was never imagined,
that the printer would be so incautious as to
publifli the letter or any part of itânothing
more was in view than to turn a handsome pe
riod, and avoid the baldnejs of a note that did
nothing but present the compliments of the
writer !"
Thus a solemn invocation to the people of
America, on the mod serious and important
iubject, dwindled at once into a brilliant con
ceit, that tickled the imagination too much to
be refilled. The imputation of levity was pre
ferred to that of malice.
| But when the people of America prcfented
themselves to the disturbed patriotic fancy, as
a routed host, scattered and dispersed by politi
cal sorcerers ; how was it polTible to refill the
hcroic, the chivalrous desire, of ere&ing for
them some magic standard of orthodoxy, and
endeavoring to rally them round it, for mutual
protection and fafety.
In so glorious a cause, the considerationsâ
that a citizen of the United States had written
in a foreign country a book containing stric
tures on the government of that country, which
would be regarded by it, as libellous and iedi
tiousâthat he had dedicated this book to the
chief magistrate of the unionâthat a republi
cation ot it under the auspices of the Secretary
of State, would wear the appearance of its
having been promoted, at least of its being pa
tronized by the government of this country â
were considerations too light and unimportant
to occasion a moment's hesitation or pause.
I hose who, after an attentive review of cir
cumstances, can be deceived by the artifices,
which have been employed to varnifli over this
very exceptionable proceeding mull: undenland
little of human nature must be little read
in the history of those arts, which in all coun
tries, and at all times have served to disguise
the machinations of fa<ftious and intriguing
The remaining circumstance of public noto
riety, which fixes upon Mr. Jefferfon the im
putation of being the prompter, or inftigatorof
detraction, exists in his patronage of the Na
tiona] Gazette.
Can any attentive reader of that Gazette
doubt, for a moment, that it has been fyftema
ticallv devoted to the calumniating and black
ening of public characters ? Can it be a qtieftion,,
that a main object of the paper is to deltroy
the public confidence in a particular public cha
racter, who it Teems is to be hunted down at all
jÂ° r the un pardonab]e fin of having been
the Iteady,invariable and decidedfriend of broad

a question, that the persecution of the officer al.

ABSTRACT OF FOREIGN NEWS.
The National AlTembly having annulled the
arrete of the feftion of Mauconfeille for de
throning the King, the departments of the mu
nicipality of Paris caused the decree of the As
sembly to be proclaimed by found of trumpet.
Prince Lumbefc, formerly commander of the
guards of the king of France, has lately been lb
hardy as to return to Paris, to fettle some do
mestic affairs. persons were hung at
Toulon the firft of July for aristocracy. Six
others loft their lives at Pertrice on afimilar ac
count.â'Notwithstanding a majority of the Na
tional AlTembly are against the proportion for
dethroning the King, at Jeaft as inexpedient at
the present crisis, a petition is opened at the
Champ de Mars for that purpose, to which about
fifty thousand persons have affixed their names,
and the number was continually augmenting.â
An infurre&ion broke out among the Austrian
troops in Tournay ; in consequence of which
the gates were shut ; the can e or the event
were not known.âSince the decree of the Af
iembly, declaring the nation in danger, was
pal Ted, the number of volunteers that turn out
is incredible.âAt the present moment, all that
is wanted in France is Union. A concert of
views and exertions as to one great object, that
of repelling their invaders. A sense of the dan
gers of discord must neceflarily produce this ef
fectâand a coalition will render them invinci
ble âFive hundred and ninety fix millions livres
of the affignats have been cancelled and destroy
ed.âA squadron intended for St. Domingo, con
fiding of one 74, four frigates, and 17 trans
ports, with 8000 men, was at the Ifje of Aix,
ready to fail, by the last accounts.âlii various
fkirmilhes with the Auftrians, the French have
had the advantage. In an action near Longwy,
the former are said to have loft: 600 men. The
armies of Austria and Pruflia were in motion on
their way to Franceâthe citizens were making
the greatest preparations to give them a warm
reception, and to defend their country to the
last extremity. About the 3Â°th J two
the enemies camps were attacked by M. de la
Fayetteâhis fuccefswould have been complete,
but for the treachery of three officers who de
serted, and alarmed the Auftrians. He howe
ver killed about 400 of them, and took 3Â° co ~
vered waggons. The loss of the French was
only three killed and twenty wounded.â I'Lon
don accounts fay, that it is an erroneous repre
sentation that Admiral Paul Jones died in dis
tress. He has left more than a thousand pounds
between his two sisters, now in the North of
EnglandâAdmiral Jones li3d a public funeral,
ordered by the National Alfembly. This, it is
said in the Paris papers, was contrary to the
opinion of the American Ministerâwho is cen
sured in those papers for his conduct, particu
larly for not attending the funeral of that ce
lebrated commander.
Some priests have been? inhumanly butchered
at Bordeaux. An ecclesiastic, 70years old, who
was endeavoring to set the fra&ured limbs of
some people at Limoges, was cut to pieces by
the mob. The Duke d'Orleans drove post, on
the iÃfh July, through the Louvre, on his
way to Paris. He was hifled, in his way thro'
the town, by a whole regiment and by the citi

ris He has been advised not to attempt any
new schemes, for the National Guards are re
solved to defend the King and the Constitu

FROM A CORRESPONDENT.
The several trials which the free
constitutions of the United States and
France have to undergo, arise from a
lawless opposition to the measures
adopted by the conftitutionai autho
rities, in pursuance of those constitu
tions. This fort of opposition has
done much to ruin the affairs of France,
as is solemnly declared by the great;
and good Fayette. Let us take care,
that the attempt begun at Pitifburgh
does not produce similar effects.
Even the Miamifavages, prompted
by rival foreign Indian traders, must
have ienfe enough to fee, that they
have better chances of wounding the
frontier people, so long as their mea
sures go to destroy the government
that proteifts them, and the revenues
afligned to pay our army. Penn.Caz.
It lmift, Cays a correspondent, give
real pleasure lo all the friends to good
government, to observe how extreme
ly watchful the President of the Unit-'
ed Stales is at all times, to discharge
the sacred trust reposed in him by
the Conflitution, with refpetS to the
execution of the laws ; and the ex
ample is worthy of being copied by
the State Governors. For it may be
taken for granted, that people who
will oppose the laws of the United
States, would, on a trivial change of
circHtnf}ances, as readily oppose those
of an individual State. And perhaps

Â£ For Proclamation of the President of the Unite <5
States, fee the 4th pageBY THE
PRESIDENT of the United States
A PROCLAMATION
. \-\7HEREAS certain violent
( / VV and unwarrantable pro
ceedings have lately taken place,tend
ing to obftrudt the operation of the
laws of the United States for raising
a revenue upon spirits difti 1 led with
in the fame, enacfted pursuant to ex
press authority delegated in the con
ltitution of the United Srates : which
proceedings are subversive of good
order, contrary to theduty that every
citizen owes to his country and tothe
laws, and of a nature dangerous to
the very being of a government.
And whereas fach proceedings ?re
the more unwarrantable, by rea(on
of the moderation which has been
heretofore shewn on the part of the
government, and of the disposition
which has been manifefted by the le
gislature (who alone have authority
to suspend the operation of laws) to
obviate causes of objection, and to
render the laws as acceptable as pos
sible : and whereas it is the particu
lar duty of the Executive " to take
care that the laws be faithfully exe
cuted and not only that duty, but
the permanent interests and happi
ness of the people require, that every
legal and neceflary Hep should b~- pur
sued, as well to prevent such violent
and unwarrantableproceedings, as to
bring to justice the infractors of the
laws and secure obedience thereto.
Now Therefore I, GEORGE
WASHINGTON, President of the
United States, do by these presents
most earnestly admonish and exhort
all persons whom it may concern, to
refrain and desist from all unlawful
combinations and proceedings what
soever, having for object or tending
to obftruft the operation of the laws
aforefaid ; inafnuich as all lawful
ways and means will be ftridtly put
in execution for bringing to justice
the infractors thereof and securing
ehcdience thereto.
A.ad 1 do moreover charge and re
quire a It courts, niagiftrates and offi
cers <vl it may concern, according
to the th of their several offices,
to exert th : powers in them respec
tively v.-fti by law for the purposes
aforefai.i ereby also enjoining and
reqnliin -.11 persons whomfover, as
the} te ?r the welfare of their coun
try , th< ill and due authority of go
vern mei t, and the preservation of
the p'il ic peace, to be aiding and as
sisting therein according to law.
In 't'tftimony whereof, I have caused
(he Seal of the United Slates to be
affixed to thefeprefents, and Signed
'.he fame -with my Hand- Bone this
fifteenth day of September, in the
year of our Lord one thousand seven
hundred and ninety two, and of the
Independence of the United States

PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION,
An ELEGANT EDITION oj the
SACRED SCRIPTURES
Ot the OLD ami NEW TESTAMENTS, with the
Apocrypha,
0n a very large and beantijul new T)pe, andfupeijine
Paper.
THE great importance ot the Holy Scriptures,
imereiting to every individual; the divine excel
lence of its doÂ£trincs and precepts, and the beauty
and sublimity of its paflages, have so long made it
a capital object of attention, as to preclude occa
sion or opportunity for eulogium.
The piety or enterprize of individuals has pre
sented this invaluable book to the public in a va
riety ot forms ; in some editions it has been highly
embellished with superb engravings, which have
greatly enhanced its price ; in others it has been
accompanied with voluminous commentaries,
which neceflarily encreafed the size; while a va
riety of plain cheap copies have generally diffufed
the knowledge of the Scripture, and made the
purchase easy to every class.
Without wishing in the lmaileft degree to lessen
the merits ot the various editions, whether plain
or ornamented, which the public are already in
poirtflion ot, it is pertinent to remark, that very
many readers ot taste and judgment have exprefled
a with for a Family Bible unencumbered with ad
ditions. There still appears room for another
edition on a beautiful new type, superior in size
and elegance to any bible that has yet been printed
in the English language, and which, leaving the
adventitious circumstances ot ornament or com
ment, may exhibit the Oracles oj God in their na
tive limplicity.
SPECIMEN OF THE TYPE.
I 5 And God said,
d Let there be light: and
there was light.
With refpeÂ£lful fubmiflion to the judgment and
candour of the public, the following proposals are
offered :
I. The woik (hall be printed with the gieateft
fidelity and attention to corre&r.efs both in the
text and marginal references, on a fuperfine Paper
made on purpose, with an elegant new Type call
for the work of the size ot the above Specimen.
11. The work will be comprised in twenty
number.*, making two elegant volumes in Folio ;
to be furnifhed to fubfeubers at one dollar each
number. To prevent any complaints of want of
punctuality, no part of ihcwork wll be delivered
unlef. paid for.
111. The firft number, containing sixty folio
pages, elegantly printed, will be furnUhed on the
firft Saturday of July next, when fubferibers are
to pay the price of the firft and second numbers,
and the piice of one number to be always in ad
vance till the work ts completed. The subsequent
numbers to be published regularly on the firft Sa
turday of each succeeding month, till the whole
is finifhed.

Church Lottery.
THE peculiar circumstances of a gentleman
who had undertaken to difpofeof a propor
tion of the tickets in the New-Bi unfwick Church

venient for him further to proceed in the sale
thereof, between eleven and twelve hundred tick

Church-Wardens and Veftiy-mcn. This lays the
Managers under the neceflity of further adjourning
the drawing of the Lottery, until the fifteenth day
of O&ober next, that they may have time to trans
mit these tickets to the parts of the state where they
aieapplied for, and receive the returns. As there
are but few tickets besides these remaining on
hand, all persons who are disposed to promote the
pious object of this Lottery, or to take a chance
for the prizes therein, are requested to supply them
selves by the firft of O&ober ; and the gentlemen
appointed to dispose of them, are desired to return
those to the Managers which then remain unfold,
