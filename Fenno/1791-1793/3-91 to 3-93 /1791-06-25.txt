FROM THE (BOSTON) COLUMBIAN CENTINEL.
Mr. RUSSELL,
IN examining the question whether the Englifti
nation, have a right, fundamently to demolilh
their present form of government, it becomes
neceflary to inquire whether Mr. Paine's afler
tion that there is no such thing as an Englifli
constitution, be really true ? This question may,
perhaps, in some measure affe<st the people of
America. For if thegovernment ofGreat-Britain,
is an ufnrpation, it may be worthy of considera
tion how far we are bound by treaties, which do
not reciprocally bind the inhabitants of that
Illand.
" A Constitution," fays Mr. Paine, " is not
a thing in name only, but in fad:. It has not an
ideal, but a real existence ; and wherever it can
not be produced in a visible form, there is none."
Mr. Paine Ihould have gone further, and told
us, whether like a deed it mult be written on
paper or parchment, or whether it has a larger
latitude, and may be engraved on (lone, or carv
ed in wood. From the tenor of his argument
it should seem, that he had only the American
Conftitutionsin his mind, for excepting them, I
believe he would not find in all history, a go
â vernment which will come within his definition ;
and of course, there never was a people that had
a constitution, previous to the year 1776. But
the word with an idea affixed to it, had been in
life, and commonly understood, for centuries
before that period, and therefore Mr. Paine
must, to suit his purpose, alter its acceptations,
and in the warmth of his zeal for revolutions,
endeavor to bring about a revolution in lan
guage also. When all the moil illustrious whig
writers in England have contended for the li
berty of their country upon the principles of
the English constitution ; when the glorious COll
- of 1774 declared that " the inhabitants of
" the English colonies in North-America were
" entitled to certain rights by the immutable
" laws of nature, the principles of the English Con
" flitutior., and the several charters or compacts,"
they knew very well what they meant, and were
perfe<fily understood by all mankind. Mr. Paine
fays that " A constitution is to a government,
what the laws, made afterwards by that govern
ment are to a court of judicature." But, when
the American States, by their constitutions, ex
pressly adopied the whole body of the common
law, so saras it was applicable to their refpecftive
situations, did they adopt nothing at all,becaufe
that law cannot be produced in a visible form ?
No, Sir, the constitution of a country is not the
paper or parchment upon which the compacft is
â¢written, it is the system of fundamental laws,
by which the people have consented to be go
verned, which is always fuppol'ed to be impres
sed upon the mind of every individual, and of
â which the written or printed copies are nothing
more than the evidence.
In this sense, Sir, the British nation have a
constitution, which was for many years the ad
mii at ion of the world ; the people of America,
with very good reason, have renounced some of
its defeats, and infirmities. But in defence of
some of its principles, they have fought and con
quered. It is composed of a venerable fyjlem
of unwritten or customary laws handed down
from time immemorial, and fancftioned by the
accumulated experience of ages ; and of a body
of Itatutes enacted by an authority lawfully com
pet en cto that purpose. Mr. Paine is certainly
Hiiltaken when he considers the British govern
ment, as having originated in the conquest of
William of Normandy. This principle of being
governed by an oral or traditionary law pre
vailed in England eleven hundred years before
that invasion. It has continued to this day, and
has been adopted by all the American States. 1
hope they will never abolish a system so excellent
merely becaufeit cannot be produced in avifible
form. The couftitutir>n of Great-Britain is a
Conltitution of principles, not of articles, and how
ever frequently it may have been violated by
tyrants, monarchical, ariftocratical or democra
tical, the people have always found it expedient
to restore the original foundations, while from
time to time they have been fuccefsful in improv
ing and ornamenting the building.
J he people of England are bound therefore
by a social compact now existing. And they have
110 right to demolilh their government, unless it
be clearly incompetent for the purposes for which
Saturday, June 25, 1791-
it was instituted. They have delegated their
whole collective power toa legislature, confilling
of a king, lords and commons, and they have in
cluded even the power of altering the conftitn
tion itfelf. Should they abuse this power so that
the nation itfelf should be opprefled, and their
rights to life, liberty, and property instead of
protecftion, should meet with tyranny, the people
would certainly be entitled to appeal in the lad
resort to themselves, to resume the trust which
has been so unworthily betrayed, and (not to do
whatever they should choose, but) to form ano
ther constitution, which (houldmore permanent
ly secure the natural rights of the whole com
munity. The fame may be said of the National
Aflembly of Ftance, who according to Mr. Paine's
idea, are poflefled of the whole collective power
of the nation, and who seem like him to think
they have a right to do whatever they choose.
Mr. Paine fays, that " the authority of the pre
sent aflembly is different to what the authority
of future aflemblies will he." Butif theprefent
aflembly lhould decree that all future national
aflemblies should pofl'efs the fame power with
themselves, it would certain'y be binding as an
article of the constitution. ,Vlr. Paine, indeed,
will not acknowledge this, and it is the second
right which he denies his nation, which at the
fame time has a right to do every thing. Mr.
Paine's ideas upon this fubjert appear to have
been formed by a partial adoption of the prin
ciple upon which Roittfeau founds the social com
part. But neither the principle of Roujfeau, nor
that of Mr. Paine, is true. Rousseau contends
that the social compart is formed by a personal
aflociation of individuals, which must be unani
mously aflented to, and which cannot poflibly be
made by a representative body. I shall not at
present spend rny time in fliewing that this is
neither practicable nor even metaphysically true.
1 shall only observe, that its operation would an
nihilate in an instant, all the power of the Na
tional Aflembly, and turn the whole body of the
American constitutions (the pride of man, the
glory of the human understanding) into a mass
of tyrannical and unfounded usurpations. Mr.
Paine does not go quite so far, but we must ex
amine whether his arguments are nor equally
wide from the truth. " A government, fays he,
on the principles 011 which constitutional govern
ments arising out ot society are established, can
not have the right of altering itfelf. Why not !
Because, if it had, it would be arbitraryÃut
this reason is not Sufficient. A nation in form
ing a social compart may delegate the whole of
their collective powers to ordinary legislatures
in perpetual fucceflion, and reserve only the right
of refilling the abuse of those powers ; and eve
ry other queftinn relative to the reservation of
powers to the nation, must be only a question of
expediency. The fame power which the pre
sent national aflembly pofl'efs in France, is by
the English constitution, constantly velted in the
king and parliament of Great-Britain ; and the
people in both kingdoms have the fame right to
resist and punish the abuse of that power. Sure
ly, Sir, the people of the United States have a
constitution, although they have given the pow
er of making alterations, to those by whom it
is administered, in conjunction with the State
legislatures. Surely, the people of Maflachufetts
have a constitution, though it provides for cer
tain alterations by the ordinary legislatures, and
though since it was formed, such alterations have
accordingly been made. The constitutions of
several of the United States, are expressly made
alterable in every part by their ordinary legis
latures. 1 think there is not one of them, but
admits of alterations without recurring to " the
nation in its original chararter." Yet Mr. Paine
will surely acknowledge that the American con
stitutions arose out of the people and not over
them. His principle therefore " that a consti
tutional government cannot have the right of al
rering itfelf" is not true. In forming their con
stitution a nation may reserve to themselves such
powers as they think proper. They may re
serve only the unalienable right of resistance a
gainst tyranny. The people of England have
reserved only this right. The French national
aflembly have been in feflion more than two
years, to make laws nominally paramount to
their future legislatures : I shall hazard some
observations upon this fubjert, when I attempt
to follow Mr. Paine, through his comparison be
tween the French and Engiifh constitutions. But
65
if
[Whole No. 225.]
as the English have delegated all their power, I
contend they have no right in their original
character to change their form of government,
unless it has become incompetent for the pur
poses, for which all governments are instituted.
I am aware of thequeftion which will occur here,
Who is to judge of this incompetency? and I
am aware of the triumphant manner in which it
may be asked. But a triumph is not my objert,
and in the pursuit of truth I (hall venture in my
next number to consider this fubjert.

N. B. About one quarter of the fpermacati is head-matter, ore
quarter of which was exported to Great-Britain, the remainder
manufaÂ£lured into candles. The fpermacÂ«eti oil, previous to the
revolution, was mostly exported to Great-Brtaiin. The aveiage
price in that market for five years previous to the war, about sony
pounds flerling for the fpermacasti oil, and fifty pounds for head.
The whale oil was formerly about one half exported to the French
and Engl'fh Weft-India islands, the other half fold in the United
States. The average price of this oil, about seventy dollars per ton.
A whale producing one hundred and twenty barrels whale oil, will
generally produce two thousand pounds bone, which was chiefly
exported to Great-Britain, the price about half a dollar per pound.
A whale producing fifty to sixty barrels, will generally produce
nearcft ten pounds of bone to a barrel of oil.âThe average price
of oil for three years past, as follows, viz.
Spermaceti, one hundred dollars per ton.
Whale oil, filty dollars per ton.
Head-matter, one hundred and fifty dollars per ton.
Bone, about fifteen cents per pound.

X2OOPARIS, April 20.
THE Kin" of France having on Tuesday fen -
night been ob ft runted by the people in
proceeding to St.Cloud.for the purpose of (pend
ing Easter there, the following took place in the
National AHembly, 011 Tuesday last m coale
quence of that affair.
AT two o'clock the President read a letter
from the King, dating his design to come to the
National Aflembly. â
The King shortly after entered. The molt
profound silence took place. Every one role.
He took his feat by the fide of the President.
The ministers took their stations beneath, and
the reft of his suite within the bar. 1 here was
then pronounced, with firmnefs and sensibility,
the followingâSPEECH by the KING :
Gentlemen, .
I HAVE come into the midst of you with that
confidence which I have ever lelHfied in you;
you have been informed of the obftruclion which
1 vefterday experienced to my departure to St.
Cloud. I would not consent that it rtiould be
repelled by force, from the fear of occasioning
acfts of severity against a deceived multitude who
thought they were arting in conformity to the
lawsfat the time they were infringing upon
them. But It behoves the nation to prove that lam
free : Nothing is so eflential to the authority
of the faniflions and of the acceptations which I
have given to your decrees. For this potent
reason, therefore, I persist in my intention of
going to St. Cloud, of which the National As
fembly will feel the neceflity. It seems as if,
for the purpole of instigating a faithful people,
whose affetftions I have deserved by what I have
done for them, endeavours were making to 111-
spire them with doubts with refpedi to my sen
timents for the constitution.
I have accepted,and I have sworn to maintain,
that constitution, of which the civil constitution
of the clergy forms a part, the execution of
which I will maintain with all my power. I
now but repeat those sentiments which I hav<
often manifefted to the National AlTembly : I
knows that my intentions and my wishes have
no other objeift than the welfare of the people ;
and that welfare can result but from an observ
ance of the laws, and an obedience to all legiti
mate and confticutional authorities.
The President immediately read the following
answer :
Sire, if the profound femiment with which
the National Afferobly is penetrated towards you,
could pofiibly receive any increase, it would be
from your presence ; May your finda
niong us, in those testimonies of aflretftion with
which you are surrounded, some compensation
for your nneafinefs. Inquietude is inseparable
from the progress of libertyâin the midst of the
cares which the good citizens take to quiet the
people, alarms are circulatedâthreatening cir
cumstances unite from all quarters, and their dif
trufl returns. __
Sire, you, the people, liberty, the conftitutipn
have but one interelt. The cowardly enemies
of the cotiftitution and of liberty are likewise
your enemies. Every heart is devoted to you.
.As you wish the welfare of the people, the peo
ple are equally solicitous for the welfare of their
King. Let us prevent a fa<ftion too well known
by its plans, its efforts, and its plots, from inter
posing between the throne and the nation, and
all our willies will be accompliflied.
When you thus come, Sire, to bind more close
ly in this Aflembly, the ties whereby you are at
tached to the revolution, you ftrengtlien the
friends of peace and of the laws. They will tell
the people that your heart is unchanged, and
every uneasiness, every diftruit, will disappear,
our common enemies will be again confounded,
and you will have procured for the country a
new victory.
[The King's speech was received with great
attention and profound silence. The President's
answer was honored with plaudits from that part
of theHoufe where the Members who belong to
the Club des Jacobins usually fit: The other Mem
bers were silent. Whilst his Majesty was with
drawing, the Jacobin Members only cried Vive
ie Roi; those who were known to be his parti
cular friends did not utter a syllable ; they said
afterwards, that they were too much lhocked at
the indiscretion of the President's speech, to be
able to express joy on the occasion.]
April 21. Order is now pretty generally re
stored, to which the conduct of the King, in dif
mifling several obnoxious persons from his ser
vice not a little contributed.
Yeflerday after dinner he difmifl'ed the former
Bishop of Senlis, and the Cardinal de Montmo
rency; and this day the majority of aristocrats
â who have hitherto surrounded his perlon, were
all difmifled, and replaced by persons less objec
tionable. This has given much pleasure to the
people, as they now promise theinfelves perfect
security, against the machinations of the enemies
of the constitution.
During tlie late riot, a Chasseur came up to
the carriage of the King, and fa.d to his majesty,
that iliac which alarmed the people of Pans was
the confidence which he had placed in puefl.,
declared enemies of the revolution, and that it
he had placed it in Ecclefiaft.es who had taken
the oath the people instead of opposing his de
parture; would have considered him as their
guardian angel.âM.de la Fayette ordered the
chafleurto be taken into custody, but it was not
The feflions met on the 19th to deliberate on
the question submitted to them by the diredlory
and as many of them as had come to any bnal
resolution, when our accounts were made up,
had refolverl. that his majesty s speech to the
National Assembly appeared to have quieted the
fears of the people ; there was no occahon tor
confiderinfrthe questions proposed ; and that it
was their duty to rely on the wisdom of the de
partment, for restoring public confidence and
tranquility
Aprtl 22 ' j i r
To calm the minds of the people, an addrels
from the department to the citizens of Paris, has
been publiihed. It is of some lengthâlaments
the late mifcondu<ft of the people, represents to
them the neceflity of good order, and due obe
dience to the laws, jultifies the King from the
suspicions entertained by the people, that he was
about to desert themârecalls to their memory
the many proofs which he has given of his pa
â¢ ental care for their welfare, and his attachment
to the new constitutionârepresents the proper
mode of redress of grievances, whether real or
supposed, hy addrefTes, petitions, deputations,
&c. which are legal steps built upon the conttitu
tion itfelf. It concludes with the strong neceiii
ty of paying due attention te this address, by be
having as good citizens, if they wilh not tia fee
the late glorious rtvolution overturned, and del
potifm, anarchy, and confufion, substituted in its
olace*
The following address of the municipality of
"'aris, to the King, has also been published :
" Sire, the municipal officers of the capital,
entrusted with ths maintenance of order and
oublic tranquility, owe to your majesty an ac
count of thecaufes which have disturbed them.
" Repositories of the interests of the people,
honored wilh their immediate confidence, it is
heir dury to make known to your majesty the
alarms which have agitated them. It is to fulfill
his double duty, that we state to your majesty,
hat the people fee vfrith alarm the throne sur
rounded by those men, who have declared them
selves their enemies, andwhofe counsels are per
haps perifidious fuggeftior.s.
" If these men, fire, were friends to yonr per
son, they would makeknown to you the withes
of the people, if they were truly religious, they
would not calumniate them to you. But, fire,
we ought to tell you, for which we have leflons
of experience, the people love the King whom
these men deceive, the power which they abuse,
and the religion whose treafurei feed their idle
ness.
" Sire, we beseech you to fend from your pa
lace, those who, concealing the regret of their
pride, under hypocritical fears, occasion uneasi
ness in your loyal, generous foul, and provoke
the just distrust of a people, jealous of the heart,
| and of the confidence of their King.
" You have declared yourfelf, Sire, the King
of the constitution, the restorer, and the guardi
an of French liberty. May these titles wnich
cover yon with immortal glory, be announced
and proclaimed amidst surrounding nations. No
thing will then be heard by you from the French
people, but acclamations expressive of their wel
fare ; and their magistrates will come with joy
to bving you testimonies of their gratitude.
These testimonies, Sire, we present you, in re
turn for the brilliant step you took yesterday, in
the midst of the National AfTembly. The fenti
ments which you then exprefled, were, for the
nation, a new proof of your love, and a new
pledge of your attachment, to the constitutional
laws of the state.

The following is an official answer which was
sent to the preceding :
To Mtffrs.the directory of the department of Pari.
" Among tlie different objecfts, gentlemen,
which you have presented for the consideration
of the King, and on one part of which his ma
jesty had already anticipated the wish which yon
expressed, (the difmiflal of the aristocrats and
nonjuring clergy) he particularly attended to
the desire tertified by the department, that he
{hould make known tojforeign nations, his senti
ments in favor of the constitution. These the
King has incessantly manifefted on all occasions,
by means of ambaft'adorsâand to the aflurances
which has been given on his part, to the differ
ent courts of Europe, we are doubtless indebted
for the tranquility which we have hitherto en
joyed. But his majesty, who will ever refped
66
the public opinion, and who will never hefftate
to remove any doubts which may be entertained
with refpedt to his sentiments, will give orders
to the ambassadors and niinifters of France, at
foreign courts,to explain thenifelves in his name,
in the fame manner as he himfelf did to the Na
tional Afl'embly. You will acknowledge, gen
tlemen, in this Hep, the readiness with which
the king, adopts whatever can contribute to
tranquilize the minds of the people, and to re
move diltruft and uneasiness.

Yesterday M. de la Fayette resigned his situa
tion, in consequence of which the centry box at
his door was immediately removed. Some sol
diers, however, went voluntarily to his honfe
for the purpose of mounting guard there, to tef
tify their profound esteem for this friend of li
berty and the laws. It is feared that this resig
nation will be followed by others. It is report
ed that the King has delayed his departure for
St. Cloud, till after the holidays.

We cannot for a moment liefirate in faying,
that the trade for slaves to Africa ought to be a

Britons. It can be vindicated by no arguments

davs it has been decided by a very great majo
rity, that this traffic is not to be abolished, a de
cision which adjusts the difpnte for the present,
but which we hnve no doubt will some time here
after be reversed ; the honor of the nation re
quires it, and humanity and every christian prin
ciple calls loudly for it.

The ELECTORS.FRANCE
The Aflembly of France have at length come
to deliberate on those great points on which
alone mull depend the excellence and perma
nency of their constitutionâthe responsibility of
the executive Ministry, and the purity of the
Legislative Council. Oti these capital points
they seem to be influenced by the fame wisdom
â¢which has uniformly marked their proceedings.
To give an idea of their sentiments in this in
stance, we givean extract from their minutes :
The responsibility of Minilters was the order
of the day ; and the following are the princi
pal articles decreed.â
No order of the King can be executed, with
out being under-signed by the minister.
No order of the King, whether verbal or writ
ten, can protett a Minister from responsibility.
Ministers shall be responsible,
1. For all offences committed by them againfl
the fafety of the nation, and the constitution of
the kingdom.
2. For any attempt against the liberty and
property of an individual.
3. For the employment of the public funds,
or any dissipations they, have made or favored.
A law also pafled, according to which.no mem
ber of the National Aflembly can accept a place
for a relation or friend, to be entered under
four years after that Legislation, of which he is
a Member, is diflblved.
Every step they have taken here appears to
have been dilated by the genius of liberty.

LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JUNE I.
OnThurfday, on a resolve reported by a com
mittee of the House of Representatives for pur
chasing four hundred fbares c pital Hock, in the
bank of the United States, a very animated de
bate took place.
The arguments advanced by the advocates of
the resolve, wereâthe influence the Common
wealth must naturally poflefs in the direction of
an incorporated body, who in foine considerable
nienfure would influence the government of the
Unionâthe preventing this influence being plac
ed entirely among the Natural Ariflocracy of the
country, i. e. men of influence and opulence, by
giving the poorer citizens whose circumstances
prevented their poflefling per/onal\x\Qaer\ce, that
influence through the medium of the State pro
perty thereinâthe advantages in a pecuniary
light, which this state would reap from such a
disposal as this of their paper and specieânow
lying useless in the treasuryâthe manifeftation
of the good will of this state to the Union, and
to the ellablifhment of a BANKâthis mode of
advantageously employing the money of the
Commonwealth, being the only one in which it
could engageâthat the avidity with which indi
viduals inverted their property in the stock of
this bank, was a strong proof of the well found
ed anticipation of its advantages, which had been
held outâwith many other reasons which the
house seemed to consider as forcible.
These were opposed with much ingenuity, and
in reply it was said, that before Mallschufetts
engaged in any such fchenie, lier own creditors
ought to be paid their just demands
that to counteract the influence the bank
-would poflefs over the government, by merely
pur chafing as much of that influence as we could
afford, was a very improper mode of proceeding
âthat being a check on the Fidtral Government
by purchasing the stock of a corporate body was
not a right mean of effe<fling itâthat if any such
thing as a Natural Ari/locracy did exill, let it be
pointed out, and fupprefledâthat if it did not,
it was ridiculous to guard againli: itseffei r ts â that
other proofs more flattering than this might be
given the Federal Gov/rnvient of our approbation
of its tneafures ; and, that it was doubtful whe
ther the stare could with propriety engage in
such an undertaking.
The qneflion, Whether the Resolve fhouldpafs ?
was negatived by a great majority.

f In t-he very intereftingdebate which took place
in the British House of Commons on the 19th of
April, 011 the fubjeil of the Abolition of the Slave
Trade, Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Fox, Mr. Pitt, and
other members, distinguished themselves by their
masterly Ipeeches in support of " a bill to pre
vent the farther importation of African Negroes
into the Briti/h Plantations." Mr. Pitt, on this
occasion, said, " That every principle that could bind
a man of hontur and of conscience, viould impel him
to give the mofl powerful JuppO't he could to the mo
tion for the abolition."
After a long and mofl important debate on the
Slave-Trade, in the Britifti House of Commons,

NEWBURYPORT, June 8.
A fubfeription is now set on foot for building
a bridge over the river Merrimac, a little above
this townâThe expence is estimated at five thou
sand pounds, which is divided into two hundred
{hares. It is already brought to a certainty that
fubferibers will not be wantingâand the utility
of filch a bridge, in this part of the country, is
so obvious, as to render it altogether unneceifary
to comment 011 the fubjetft.

SONNET to CAROLINE.
H AST thou not seen upon some night serene,
The silver moon with smiling radiance beamâ
Illume the groveâenliven every dreamâ
And add new charms to every lovely scene ?
So charming Caroline thy angel-smile
On day or night unequall'd joy bestows.
Does the fad breast ot grief and pain beguile,
And stays the tear which elle forever flows.
In thy foft smile the foul of sweetness lives,
That grace, which shines exalted over artâ
Which speaks the friendly and the feeling heart,
And ev'ry virtuous wi(h and transport gives.
Then lovely Carol i n e thv smile repeat;
I fear not there the poison of deceit.

pursuing their plan of fubferibing to the Bank of the Unued States.
Subscriptions in New-York, Boston, and other parts of the Eas

venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks on
each fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid veflels in pafling through. Also, one lamp on each fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during
the continuance of the lease.
(c p. 3 m.
The bridges ate to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as {ball render them perfe&ly substantial and secure in
the opinion of the commiflioners, and are to be of a fufficient
height to protest them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for cairiage way, 20 feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on each fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet.
Do. for balluftrades, 1 foot each r 2 feet.
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluftrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Boston and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept in constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be (urrendered in good order,
agreeably to the a6t.
The following arc the terms which the commiflioners are au
thorised to offer to contrattors :
A lcafc of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the pre
sent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an estimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
aflual rtceiptsof the ferries for a medium of five years last part,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will consequently produce an
immediate income of goo pounds per ann. This may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftruftion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the weflern fide of the Hudson, are all important
circumstances, which must neceflarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commissioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads connected
withthebridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places shall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the contra&s for eiefting them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as maybe inclined to contract on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to William Maxwell,
E(q. in New-York, fpecifying the (honed period of lease for
which they will undertake to ereftthe said bridges,together with
proper fecunty for performing the fame.
