A DISCOURSE OF STEPHEN BOEJ'IUS,
Concerning voluntary Servitude : Or the Anti-One.
(luntinuedjr'um A'o. 8 vf this Gazette.)
T? U 1 if, by accident, there fliould be born at
-Aâ' this day a nation wholly new, not acctiltom
ed to Fubjeciion, nor habituated to the delicacies
tit liberty, and it they were ignorant of both,
and scarcely knew their nanu s : if you present
ed to them the offer, eitlier to be lubjcCt, or to
live in liberty,to Which would they devote tliein
lelves ? We ought not to make any difficulty, in
believing that they would love better to obey
leafon only, than to serve any man : at ieatt e
very people would make this choice, except the
Israelites, who without constraint, and without
any neceliiry made themselves a tyrant : of
which people I never read the history, without
ieeling such a resentment as to become almost
inhuman, and rejoice in all the calamities that
befel them. But certainly all men, who have
in them any thing of the leal character of men,
before they fuffer themselves to be fubjeÂ«sied,
they must be either confirained or deceived :
conllrained by the arms of it rangers, as Sparta
and Athens, by the forces of Alexander ; or by
tactions, as tlie domination of Athens had once
before come into the hands of Pilillratus. By
fraud they frequently lose their libertv : and in
this, they are not so often seduced by another
as iliey arc deceived by themselves. Thus the
people of Syracuse, the matter city ol" Sicily,
which is called at this day Saragofia, beingprefl
ed by wars, inconsiderately adopting no order,
but againit danger elevated Dionyfius the firit,
and gave him the charge and command of the
army .- and took no precautions, till they had
made him so great, that this brave fellow, re
turning victorious, as if he had not conquered
his enemies, but his fellow citizens, made him
lell of a captain a king, and of a king a tyrant.
It is not credible, how the people as f'oon as they
are InbjeOted, fall suddenly into so profound an
oblivion of t heir franchifes, that it is not poliible
they should awake to reoain them : Serving so
frankly and lb voluntarily, that one would fay,
at the figlu of them, that they had loft not their
liberty, but their servitude. It is true, that in
the beginning they serve by conftraint,and over
come by force : but those who come after, hav
ing never teen liberty, and knowing not what
it is, serve without regret, and perform with a
good will what their predecefiors did by con
itraint. It is thus, that men born under the
yoke, and afterwards houi iflied and elevated in
servitude; without looking forward, contenting
themlelvesto live as they are born, and not
Thinking that they have other rights, nor other
property, than such as they have found, they
mittake for their nature, the Itate of their birth.
\et there is no heir so prodigal and careless, as
not to edit his eye sometimes upon his parch
ments, to fee whether he enjoys all the rights of
his lucceilion, or whether any one has trel'pafled
or intruded on him or his predecellor. Certain
ly custom, which has in all things a great power
over us, lias in nothing so great a virtue as in
this, to teach us to serve : and, (as they fay of
Mithridates, who familiarized himfelf to drink
ing poison) to teach us to swallow and not to
find bitter the venom of servitude. It cannot be
denied, that nature has a great power over us
to draw us as (he will, ahd to make us properly
be called well or ill born : but we mult confefs
that fiie has less power over us than cullom :
becaute the natural disposition, however good it
is, is loll,if it is not cultivated : and nurture and
education makes us always what it will, in
fpigbt of bature. 1 lie feeds of good, which na
ture has planted in us, are so slender and deli
cate that they enduie not the smallest injury
from a contrary education. They grow not with
more east ih their natural fliapes than they
are bastardized, transformed and brought to no
thing, like the fruit frets, which have all some
natural contexture, which they preserve well, if
you lutler them to grow : but they yield them
selves with equal ease, to bear a foreign fruit
and not their own, as soon as you graft or ino
culate them. The herbs have every one their
peculiar properties, their natural Angularity :
bur the frott, the season, the foil, or the hand
of the gardiner, can either add or diminish much
of their virtues. The plant which we have
leen in one plare, we are fcarcelv able to know
in another.

ELEGY 11.
WHAT unknown Beauty so majestic moves !
Softâlet rne pais her, on her charms to gaze ;
The look of lovelinels my heart improves,
Dear to my foul is female virtue's face.
Heavens! tis the woman of my hopeless love !
Tis (he ! tis (he ! the sovereign of my foul !
Time's unrelenting trials cannot prove
Of force energic paffton to ccntroul.
Bled be this hour of new-creating joyâ
Haftrâlet me follow where her beauty leads ;
Despair no more (hall happiness destroyâ
Delightful extacv my grief succeeds.â
âWhere will my trembling transports bear me on !
Realcn thy power is baniih'd from my breast.â
Delusion's momentary reign is gone,
Known but to break with agony my reft.â
Such is the fortune of my wayward days,
With Irantic woe, convulsive sorrow, fraught;
With peace that, flattering, to despair betrays ;
And all the keener pangs of torturing tho't.
O I have strove, with carefulnefs, and pain,
This hapless pailion from my foul io rend ;
Have bent to study, sleepless toil'd for gain,
And hail'd wild difiipation for my friend.â
Rich inourfelvcs, with mutual fondnefs blefs'd,
We could have lived, the envy of the age ;
With equal love, carcflitig and carefs'd,
Have smiled tegardlefsof affliction's rage,
For wealth to me isjoylefs and despised,
I ask not riches, as I love no; care;
By me the smile ol competence is prized,
It gives contentment if it cnarms my Fair.
On us. what greater joy could gold bestow
But that it gave us liberty and ease ;
The power to heal the broken heart of woe,
And human pleasure, human weal increase ?
Then, while the look of cheertulnefj, and praise,
The prayer of giatitude, thy footftjps blefs'd ;
To fold thy beauties in a last embrace,
And, life resigning, fink upon thy breast j
Would be my earnest, and my only, prayer.
But now remembrance, exquisite in grief,
Fills all my anguifh'd besom with despair,
And wrests from Mercy'i hand all kind relief.

FROM THE CONNECTICUT COURANT.
THE PROMPTER.
When a man is going down hill, every one gives liim a kick.
THIS, it is laid, is very natural ; that is, it is
very common. There are two reasons for
thisâFirit, it is lnucheafier to kick a mail tlo-mn
hill, than to push him up billâSecond, men love
to fee every body at the bottom of the hill but
then.selves.
Different men have different ways of climbing
into ranks and office. Some bold fellows take a
run and mount at two or three flrides. Others
of less vigor use more artâthey creep slyly along
upon their bellies, catching hold of the cliffs anc!
twigs to pull thenifelves upâfonietiines they
ineer a high rock arid are obliged to crawl round
itâat other times they tatch hold of a promi
nent cliff or a little twig, tvliith gives way and
back they tumble, scratching their clothes and
fonietiines their Ikin. However it is, very few
will lift their neighborsâuiilels to get a lift
themselves. Yet fonietiines one of these Crawl
ers will lend a hand to their neighbouring Crawl
ersâaffetft to pull hard to raise them all a little,
then getting upon their fliohlders, give a leap
to an eminence, and leave them all in the lurch,
or kick them over, 'i he moment one begins t >
tumble, every one who is near hits him a kick.
But 110 people get so many kicks as poor debt
ors in failing circumltances. While a man is do
ing very well, that is, while his credit is food,
every one helps himâthe moment lie is pj efled
for money, however honest and able he maV be,
he gets kicks from all quartets. His frier.ds and
his reputation desert him with the less of his
p'urfe, and he soon tumbles to the bottom of the
hill.

FROM THE FEDERAL GAZETTE,
Mr. Brown,
T HEREWITH transmit you a very important
A Decree of the National Aflembly of France mi
the fiibjeci of Tobaccoâit has a tendency to pro
hibit the carriage of that article in American
bottoms to France, and is therefore of serious
consequence to our navigation and commerce
our rulers will do well to have an eye on the ope
rations of the European governments, which
one after another seem to aim at clipping the
wings of our rising trade in proportion as they
endeavor to protect their ownâthe corifequences
of these ineafures cannot but be felt in this coun
try by and by, if not.timely noticed and prevented.
Holland is about preventingthe importation of
teas but by their own tart-India Company, in
consequence of, it is thought, importations of
that article from the United States to Amfter
dninâSpnin excludes our ships and people from
all her colonies and lays heavy duties on our flour
exported to themâFrance will {hut up her colo
nies to us the moment her liarveit fhal 1 be copi
ous enough to enable her again to supply them
In Portugal our flour is prohibited and even our
grain fold under many diladvantages and reftric-
VÂ° l,s â t ' le Mediterranean the Barbary cor
sairs allow us no acctfs, and our flag is scarce
seen in that seaâShould a pacification happejt
between the Ruffians and Turks, the demand fpr
our supplies of grain must be considerably re
duced by abundant, and cheap supplies from .the
Baltic.âBut now for the Decree abovementioned,
of which follows an accurate translation
DECREE on the importation and exportation of
1 obacco, and out lie duties on the importation
thereof.
Article i. ThÂ» importation of manufactured
tobacco is prohibited throughout the kingdom,
nor (hall it be imported in the leaf but in hag
fheads through the ports and in the lhips here
after mentioned.
2. Leaf tobacco shall be only imported by sea
from the United States of America, the Spanilh
colonies, Russia and the Levantâtliefe tobaccos
mud be imported divert, that is, those fro in the
United States in ships of the said States, or in
French shipsâthose from the Spanilh colonies in
Spanilh or French shipsâthose from the Ukraine
in Ruffian or French (hipsâthose from the Levant
in French ships only,âall importation Â®f the
said tobaccos in other bottoms is prohibited.
3. The importation of tobacco from the Uni
ted States, the Spanish colonies, the Ukraine and
the l evant, shall only take place at the ports
following, to wit : Bayonne, Botiideaux,Roche
fort, La Rochelle, Nantes, L'Orient, Moilaix,
St. Maioes, Grandville, Honfleur, Cherburg,
Rouen, Havre-de-Grace, Dieppe, St. Valery on
the Somme, Boulogne, Calais, Dunkiik, Mar

4. It is further permitted tin import foreign to
bacco in the leaf and in good order whatever be
the growth of itâthrough the custom houses oF
Stralbourg, Valenciennes and Lille, paying du
ties thereon of 25 livres per quintal.
5. The fame duty of 2J livres per quintal shall
be paid on all tobaccos' imported in the ships of
the United States, Spain or Russia.
6. A duty of only 18 livres 15 sols Jjer quintal
shall be paid on tobaccos imported an French
ships direcft from the United States, the Spanish
colonies, Ruflia or the Levant.
The Aflembly suspends the consideration of the
importation of tobaccos from the colonies of
Franceâby the above regulation a hogshead of
tobacco imported in an American bottom into
France pays about 12 dollars more duty than the
fame hogshead would do in a French (hip the
motion had a good deal of opposition in the As
sembly, and some friends of America warmly in
terposed, which occasioned one member wittily
to observeâ" thefegentlemen are so much Ame
ricans that they forget they are Frenchmen"â
the Decree was carried by a considerable ma
jority.

LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
The committee appointed to count the votes
for Governor and Lievu. Governor reported,that
His Excellency John Hancock, Esq. was cholen
Governor, and His Honor Samuel Adams, Esq.
Lieutenant Governor of this Commonwealth.
At half pall 12 o'clock His Excellency the Go
vernor appeared in the House (where the Senate
had convened) and in a short and pertinent ad
dress, informed the two branches of the General
Court, That he had been politely informed by
their committee of his having been re-eleifted to
the office of Fitft Magistrate of the Common
wealth , that he was fully sensible of the honour
done him by this fYefli instance of the confidence
46
rcpofed in him by the citizens thereof ; that he
expeiienced the highell famf.uftion in contem
plating that the welfare and happiness of the
Commonwealth had ever been the chief objects
of his concern, and that he (hould nor fail 0 f
paying that attention to its interests which this
repeated instance of confidence demanded. The
Pi efident of the Senate then administered the
oaths to his Excellency. Before the President of
the Senate administered the oaths to his Honor
Samuel Adams Efq.he addrefled the two branches
as follows
Mr. President.
BY the Constitution of this Commonwealth,
powers fufficient for the preservation of the
rights and liberties of the people and the well
ordering of civil fuciety. are annually delegated
to such persons as the free citizens think fit to
confide in. Those original righrs of men,which
are deemed to be by the laws of God and Nature
unalienable, are secluded from the controul of
civil government ; and are lefc to be exercised
by eaHi individual, at his own discretion with
out injury to others. It is a Constitution, not
obtruded by any one man, or any number of
men who might combine to gratify their own
feelings to the exclusion of all others, but con
templated, deliberated, approved and adopted
by the people themselves.
You are very sensible, Sir, there are advan
tages in frequently recurring to fir it principles.
It is the express language of this excellent
Constitution, and I conceive it to be the clear
voice of Nature and Ileafon, that "all power
originally resides in the people ; and being de
rived from them, the several Magistrates and
Officers of government, whether Legislative,
Executive orjudicial, are their substitutes and
agents,antl are at all times accountable to them."
That " the people alone have the inconteftible,
unalienable and indefeafible right to institute
governments, and to reform, alter or totally
change the fame, when they find their own fate
ry, protection and welfare require it." That.
" the idea of a man born a Magistrate, Legislator
Â°r Judge, is absurd and unnatural."
May it not hence be inferred, that claims to
hereditary right, to shares in sovereignty, or in
the adminilb ation of government, tranfmiflible
to children, or relations by blood are ufurpations
of the natural rights of men, as well as totally
repugnant to the firft principles of our free Con
stitution. It is further declared, that " thr
people have a right, at certain periods, to cause
their public officers to return to private life, and.
to fill up vacant places by regular elections and
appointments." And, " that all elections ought
to be free."
Upon thele, and other like principles, the
people of this territory did solemnly and mutu
ally igree with each other, to form thcmfclvcJ in
to a free, sovereign and independent body poli
tic or flare.
When the year expired, in which I was called
to officiate in the office of Lieutenant Governor
of this Commonwealth, I freely and voluntarily
complied with a rule of the Constitution, wifely
calculated, and I conceive intended, to secure
and perpetuate annual elections, and returned
to my own native private ftatiou in the commu
nity,
A joint committee of the two branches of the
General Court, have by their order informed
me, that my fellow citizens have thought it pro
per again to elet r t me to the fame office. lam
highly honored by this repeated mark of their
confidence. I accept the trust : And am ready,
before this venerable and freely elected Legifla
iure now convened for the purpose, ro take and
fubferibe, the several oaths and declarations
which the Constitution of this Commonwealth
have made pre-requifite to my at r ting in the of
fice. Havingdone this I ffiall ufemy utnioft en
deavor, to perform the duties required, diligent
ly and faithfully, according to the belt of my
ability and understanding.
A petition from Mr. Winflow Warren was
read. It stated the circumstances of his commit
ment for debt under the authority of the United
States, and the peculiar hardlhips with which it
\ras attendedâand prayed that relief might be
granted him by an a<'t or resolve being paned
explaining the law of the Commonwealth which
granted the privilege of iinprifontnent the
gaols, to the Unired States, so as that the prison
ers of the United States may not be precluded
from the liberty of the yard, in such cases asaie
allowed by the laws of this State.
Referred to a committee who reported a b.U
agreeable thereto.
Died at Concord, the 16th in ft. Col. John But-
TERtcic, in the 6oth year of liis age.âA widow
and ten children deeply mourn the loss of a ten
der husband and kind fatherâand the town and
Church sincerely regret the death of a very va
luable member. His remains were interred un
der arms ; and other marks of affection and ref
peJt accompanied his interment. The corpl'a*as carried into the nieetlng-houfe, where an
ingenious and well-adapted oration wnsdelivered,
to a numerous allembiy, by John Merrick, Efq!
His fellow-citizens were excited to such expref
fionsof friendship and honor io his remains and
iipemory, by a grateful sense of his patriotic and
Leroic conduct in the late American revolution
and particularly by the recolleJlion of his bra
vely and fii muelSj 011 the memorable 19th of
April, 1775, being one of the two who, at Con
cowl bridge, led 011 the American militia to face
and repulle the Bririfh troops. A number of
fingers preceded the corpse, and as the procession
approached the bridge, on the very spot where
the deceaft-d, in 1775, gave orders to return the
Briufh fire, they sung a well chosen hymn, and
moved on singing tothe place of interment.

And nobly imitate their fire.

Mr. Cowan,

EVERY rhipg wears here a fiugulaf afpedi
We had yesterday a meeiing of the citizens,
pursuant to summons from the high flienff, ii<
order to censure that part of the address of the
house of lords, moved by the Duke of Lei lfter,
which infinnated, that thepeo ; leofl'eland weie
a mifgnided set of men. This was agreed to with
only four diffenring voices.
It was unanimously refjlved, that we never
will, as inagift rates or jurors, give operation to,
or allow the force of, any English acft of parlia
ment ; and that an imme Hare committee of cor-
Tefpoudence be appointed to hold council with
the reit of the aflbciations of Ireland.
I he fecrerary came in about four, arid in a
speech of a long duration endeavored to explain
to the house the purport and tendency of a bill
for regulating ihe intercourse and commerce be
tween G eat-Britain and In andâafter having
urged a great variety of arguments to prove ihe
propi ety of proceeding by bill in preference to
any other method, concluded with leave to brino
it in.
. ' Mr.Connolly opnofedthc motion in the fuft
inltance, declaring that the bill, if fuffered io
be brought in, would totally take away their con
ltitution, and leave them no commerce at all
Mr. Fetter objected, and pledged his ho
no,r(t"Blve ,c eve, T opposition in his power.
Mr. Grartan, in one of the ableit and mod
eloquent speeches perhaps ever delivered in this
house of parliament, opposed the bill as a door
ro vafialage and slavery, since it proffered com
merce as a barter for constitution.âHis speech
>vas full of pointsâit-was interesting, attractive
and sublimeâThe whole audience grew silent
as he fpnke, and, having caught the enthusiasm
were loft in admiration.
" James, you know the little fellow, he was
upon his poor little legs for two hours and a half.
" T he iuftant he fat down, Mr. Montgomery,
member for your county, aroseâHe appeared'
vo be pel tectly familiar with the fubjetft, and as
ulual proved his claim to patriorifm, reputation,
and a man ol talents. The debate continued for
some time with uncommon vehemcnce ; all the
great speakers, and the diftinguiflied country
gentlemen, took part in the business, and mem
bers from every part of the kingdom declared
themselves against such a system.
" Parliament is now (thank fortune) pro
togued until September.â We have had aveiy
long and a very interesting feflion, endeavoring
to procure by threats what I fear will Coon be
lhei el ult of blows. âIf I guess in this pa r
licular, 1 desire you may'give no credit to any of
my future prognoflicationS."

AN IMITATION.
All tongues speak of himâaged fights
Are peftacled to fee him : The pratling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While fbe views him The rustic lasses pin
Their richeff geeraround their fun-burnt necks
Clambering the walls to eye him : flails, trees, windows
An-fmother'd up ; house-tops and ridges fill'd
With various ranks of men ; all agreeing
In earnestness to frt him old Senators
Do press among the popular throng, and puff
To win a vulgar flation : beauteous dames
Commit thi' war of white and damask in
Their nicely gauded cheeks, to the wanton spoil
Of Phcebus' burning kisses. Such joyful (horns
As if the VERY DEITY WHO GUIDES HIM
Were slyly crept into his human powers
To give him grace and honor !

such an antagonist, and observed that it was unjust, and a rnanifeft
dereliction of every principle of proprietyâa discouragement to
every effort to acquire a competent knowledge of the profeflion
of the law, to obuin which much study was requisite, and great
expence nccelTar.ly in. urred. The Juflice observed in replv, tha

SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
I do not think with the paragraphs in your last, that age alone
uggefts a fufficient reason for the rejection of any customs, forms
or ceremonies, which have heretofore obtained among mankind;
hut I do conceive, that as the rays of knowledge and common
r enfe extend thei* influences thro' the civilized world, thfc barbae
rous ideas which have kept our species in the lowest degree of de
gradation, will be exploded, and man become more
the friend and alTociate of manâwhich never can be the cafe, so
long as riches, titles, honort and iijlincltons, draw such a line of
eparation between them. c
The credit of the United States, through the benign influ
ence of the general government, and those financial arrangements
which have been formed under its auspices, has emerged from the
mod deprelTcd and abject situation. Theftocks have risen beyond
all experience and all parallel. If the expectation only of punc
tuality on the part of the government has been equako producing
such furprifmg effects, what may not reasonably be anticipated
from that great aÃive capital which will be crcated by the Bank,
fvftem, to aid and facilitate the payments of individuals to the go
vernment, and of the government to its creditors ?
There can be little ooubt of the fix per cenis being very fhort
'v above par. The holders of public paper would do well there
fore to deliberate leisurely before they part with their flock.
The interest of the general government, is the intcreft of the
States, individuallyâthey (land or fall togetherâthis idea pro
ved paramount to that local jealousy, which, while it produced
a wretched schism, would have kept us forever weak and de
graded.
The clause in the law for establishing the bank, of the United
States by which any particular State is precluded from a larger
credit than 50,000 dollars, so far from (hiking at the fuvereigntv
of the individual Statesâis, fays a correspondent, calculated to
produce dire&ly the reve.fe effect ; it puis every State upon an
equal footing, thus precluding jealousy; and consequently no par,
ticular State can avail ufelf ol superior fun Is to enhance its credit
with theTreafury of the United States,and to encreafe its influence
in the Union to the injury of its neighborsâneither is there an un
due ftimulous held out to a powerful State to aid in measures.
which might be injurious to the others. The disinterestedness of
the provision is equally conspicuous with the justice and found
policy of Itâfor the general government thereby precludes itfelf
from offering a douceur to a particular State, for any fmifter pur
pose whatever. ' "

Subje&to a dedu&ion of twelve and a halt per cent.
The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to thofc who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven ; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful situation is not surpassed, if equalled by any ; be
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the iound
but by reaion of the flats, this wharf is necetfarily extended to the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the mo ft extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3~4ths ot a mile; and not only the
mercantile interefk of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general with that prevails in the minds ot all clalFes of people, for
the fpccefs ot this enterprise, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there being; more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet published in
Amcriea) induce the manager? to believe the tickets will meet with
a speedy sale.
The drawing will ppfitivcly commence at State-House, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, it the
tickets are sols.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be pubiifhed, and the prizes
paid on demand, by the managers. Those prizes notcaJled for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
for the ufc ot the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.

TWO THOUSAND ACRES of LAND, in Jrffcrfon County,
state of Kentucky, fttuate 25 miles from Louisville, in a thick
fettled neighbourhood. This tract is supposed by good judges
who are acquainted w?ih its situation and quality, to be the moil
valuable in that part of the country, as its connedtion by water
with Louisville, the principal town in all Kentucky, muftincreafe
its value âit was some of the firll land taken up in thu neighbour
hood, so that the title is indisputable. Lands in the neighbourhood
of Louisville, not superior in quality or situation, have fold cur
rently at one guinea per acre.
The Proprietor of this tra& wishes to dispose of it for Cash, in
order to improve other trafls in that neighbourhood, and therefore
will fell cheap.
Any gentleman desirous to bargain for the fame, may, by appli.
cation to the Printer, be informed of the price.

gentlemen in the state of Virginia, who will if required, certify
its value. (taw gw)

memorial to Congress, stating his intention to publish ,1
complete and corred ottavo edition of the Laws, Refutations, and
Treaties oÂ£ the United States, and praying that such meafur<-Â«
might be adopted as would give authenticity to said edition
The memorial was read in the House of Representatives, and re
ferred to the Secretary of State. On the seventh of February that
officer, after mature deliberation made the following report :
<4 The Secretary of State, to whom was referred th? memorial
of Andrew Brown, printer, of Philadelphia, has had the fame un

printed by Childs and Swaiiie; that this edition is authentic, the
proof-fheets thereof having been carefully collated by sworn
clerks, with the original rolls in his office, and rendered literally
conformable therewith. That the fit ft volume of this edition can
now rarely be found, the copies originally priottd being mostly
disposed ot.
That it is desirable that copies of the laws should be so multi
plied throughout the states, and in such chcap forms, as that every
citizen of the United States may be able to procure thein. That
it is important also, that such publications be rendered authentic,
by a collation of the with the original rolls, by fworrÂ»
clerks, when thev are print -o at the feat of government, or in its
neighbourhood, and by a collation of the whole work when print
ed at a distance, and a certified correction of its typographical er
rors annexed to fach volume.
That this, however, if done at the public expense, would occa
sion an inconvenient augmentation of the number of clerks, as the
ast of collation requires the presence of three clerks, one'to hold
the roll, a second a printed copy Jafteady authenticated, and the
third the proof sheet.
That it would be more reasonable that persons of confidence
should be emploved, at the expence of the Editor, to be named
and sworn as clerks, for the fpeclal occasion.
That, in this way, he is of opinion that it will be advantageous
to the public 10 perinitthat the Laws, to be printed by the Memo,
rialift, be collated with, and corre&ed by, the original rolls, and
that a certificate thereof, by the Secretary ol State, be annexed to
the Edition.

As this Edition of the statutes of the united states is
to be printed at the feat of government, and with the ftppi obatios
of Congress, and as the proof-flieets shall be collated with tlVc
original rolls and records, by sworn cleÂ»ks, in the office of the
