by the Greenwich School, for the sea service, in Qr
about the year 17 75, and who was then of the age
of 14 years, or thereabouts, and failed from Eng

from thence in the said month of March, or in the
month of April following, to some portor place in
America, but to wh3t port or place is not known ;
and that in the Month of Mav, 1780, the said fliip
or veflel was seen at Barbadoes, in the Weft-In

heard of, and is supposed to be dead, it having
been reported that the Tender belonging to the
said ship or veflel called the Vengeance, which
ship was then commanded by Captain Knowles,
with a number of her men, to the amount of 20,
or thereabout (and among whom the said Henry
Webb is supposed to be one) were taken bv the

MR. FENNO,
Having lately had a conversation with a friend,
who has travelled in Europe, and made a great
many observations on men and governments,
1 have thought his sentiments, on the present
temper of American parties, proper to be
known. I have endeavoured to express the
substance of them in the following remarks.
FACTIONS are almost harmless in Englandâ
and as our language is the fame, and our
form of government nearly similar, we are apt
to conclude that faction-, will be harmless alfoin
thi-, country. A great many persons seem to
like the budle of wrangling parties, ami the
Printers think their Gazettes insipid, and in
danger of losing cuftoni, if they refufe to mix a
portion of gall with their ink. They sometimes
want fprightlinSfs, they are often barren of in
formationâbut their readers do not fay that
they are too milky. Accordingly we fee the
government bespattered, and the heads of de
partments, and members of Congress, blacken
ed; and ail the arts of infmuation and decep
tion put in praiftice, to make the people as an
gry as the writers seem to be.
We are told that the measures of government
have done but little good, and that littte was
Wednesday, June 6, 1792.
States;
{epxm & \awwri)
HOPE

not intendedâthat, however, they have done
infinite mifchief, which was intended, and is a
part oi a plan of iniquity contrived by those
who administer the offices of the government.
This evil, they tell us, is ft til spreading, and
will be fatal to the property, rights and liberty
of the many, in order by their plunder to ag
grandize the few. That all these consequences
are the more to be dreaded, and are the more
certain, as the country is too extensive to be
subject to one free government, and the consti
tution has not made a proper definition and a
clue separation of its powers. Let any man
read the newspapers which have been publiflied
for some time past, and judge what consequen
ces the writers must intend to have drawn from
their premises, and what is the tendency of the
opinions they propagate so industriously. Doubt
less these writers wife to persuade the people
that what they tell them is trueâand if the
people can be brought fully to believe themâif
they can fee the government and its officers in
as odious a light as they are exhibited, the event
is inevitable. The people having all power in
their hands, will certainly use it to destroy a
government that will destroy them., and which
they are told has already made great progress
the work.
Inflammatory addrefles to the passions of men
have a tendency to create disturbances and con
vulsions in all countriesâbut they are peculiar
ly alarming in our country from the nature of
our government, and the temper of our citizens.
In England, we fee, the most threatening ap
pearances have not been followed by civil war,
although from time to time it has been gene
rally thought inevitable : but England is an
island ; the sea like a band prefTes the State to
gether and keeps it from breaking to pieces ;
foreign enemies, stronger than itfelf are feared
fufficiently to keep the sense of national union
always strong. A King at the head of the force
of the nation, and to whom all men of property
cling with a confcieufnefs that all property will
jbe set afloat with the government, is able to
crufti the lirft riling against the laws. There
is no legislative aflembly, subordinate to the
Parliament analogousto our State governments,
to collect the discontented together and to ena
ble them to wield the lawful authority of a
diftrift against the whole of the nation.
More than all, habit has moulded them into one
indivisible nation, and has given a fan&ity to
the laws and constitution which no party man
can invade without shocking all his adherents.
Prosperous as our country is, and free and
enlightened as our citizens are beyond the reft
of mankind, we are so newly moulded together,
we have so little to fear from other nations,
and the sources ofdifcontent and division are so
fruitful and various, that the love of good or
der cannot be too fedulouflv cultivatedâThe
government being the work of the people them
ielves, and being their only security for the
preservation of liberty, (hould be viewed with
aflfeftion and supported with vigilance and care.
It (liould be well watched, it is true, and if bad
men gain an election, the only and proper re
formation is to chufe better men in their pla
ces. But let the friends of the unionâlet those
who abhor civil ftrife look to it, left while they
are unmindful of the turbulent and deftrut'tive
deligns of the enemies of the constitution, a few
million of the uncontradicted falfehoods which
are spread about (hould have poisoned the minds
of the peopleâlike the eggs of the infe<st tribe
they are deposited in every lurking place, to
remain inactive till the firft season of ferment
ation shall hatch a venomous and loathlbme
race to canker and devour the fair fruits of
which we already fee the blodbms.
Our government is too new, and too feeble,
and its powers too much divided with the State
governments to bear the convulsions of vindic
tive factions. Perhaps there is no class of men
who are more interested in the preservation of
the present constitution than the Printersâ
their business has grown and is growing furpri
iinglv ; yet although full of federalifm, zeal and
intelligence, it is painful to fee that they seem
generally disposed to prefer the publication of
such pieces as are unfriendly to the national au
thority. What is this owing to ? Surely not to
the desire of prostrating the government. Ge
nerally fpealcing, they are principled against the
fchetties of those who are laboring to fu'overt the
union : for the fiiccefsful progress of their art
depends on a free, firm government, and inter
nal tranquility,more perhaps than any other bu
siness whatever : The cause is to be fought ii)
another quarter; the blame of men and mea
fijrcs fells better than praise ; and, as a news
paper is supported by curiofity,it maybe doubt
ed whether the exclusion of such incendiary pub
lications would not injure the circulation of the
newspaper. Accordmgly, we fee that in every
country the nexufpapers are almost er.clufivelv
in the hands of those who complain of the ad
ministration. Let the priuters go on and pub
liftiâlet the public hear all that the most angrv
man has to fay : But let the printers observe
that they ought to publilh the other fide of the
question also ; that they ought to let the answer
follow the charge, and that they are not bound
as good citizens to publilh and repubtifli the
falfeft and fouleft flanders of the principles of
the constitution, and of the men who exercise
its powers.

FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.
REFLECTION'S on the STATE of the ITNIOS,
Concerning the manufafturei of the United States.
IN purfuingthe confiderationof American ma
nufactures as beneficial and neceilary to the
southern states, it will be ufeful to take a curl'o
ry view of the indications of attachment and
disposition to them, which are discoverable in
that quarter.
Virginia appears to be making a greaterprtf
grrft in merchant mills than any state in the
union, though some are yet far before her in
those beneficial works. Maryland and Delaware
which are in the southern moiety, are second
only to Pennsylvania in this branch. There is
little doubt that more pig and tar iron is made
to the southward of Pennsylvania, than to the
northward of it. A lead mine has been opened
in Virginia, whica is extending its supplies
through the union, and promises fair to be coirt
menl'urate with the present demand : and there
is one, which is now worked, in the territory
south of the Ohio. But no lead mines are in
considerable operationinthe ftatesnorth or eatt
of Virginia, though a fnr.ill beginniag upon one
in the western part? of Pennsylvania is made.
An alTociation in Virginia, another in the ter
ritory south of the Ohio, and a company in the
western distriCt of South-Carolina, have [provid
ed themselves v.-ith carding and spinning ma
chinery on the British plan, to manufacture
their native cotton. The planters in the south
ern states raise quantities of this raw material,
unthought of before the war, and until the dif
cuflions of the (Ã¼bjeCt of manufactures, which
took place after tiie treaty of peace. The fa
mily manufactures in cotton are much greater in
the four fouthemmoft states, than in the four
eastern states. There are not wanting consi
derable numbers of Jheep in the five southern
states, yet by the two returns ofexports, it ap
pears that no meo/has been sent from thence to fo
reign markets. It has been couimoa to receive,
wool in Pennsylvania from the eastern states,
though they manufacture so much, but it is not
known that any is ever received there for sale
from the foutliern states, Wool has been trans
ported to Salem in North-Carolina,and to Wui
chefter in Virginia, from the city of Philadel
phia, for the hat manufactory.
There has been full as great a current ofe
migration of flour mi/lcrs, black-smiths, timers, hat
ters, cabinet-makers, dijlillers, coopers, &c. to the
southern States from those north of them, in
proportion to numbers as of farmers; so that
the worklhops of the middle and northern states
yield a double benefit to their fellow-citizens in
the south, in supplying them with manufactures,
and artizans,
There is greater variety in distillation in ths
four southern states than in the four eaflerrâ
that is, the manufactory is ejlablifhed on a bioader ba
ft. It is also more certain in the south than in
the north. In the latter, molasses is the prin
cipal ingredient, and being from an external
source, may be loft to the eastern distillers.
Their manufactory is even now at hazard, un
less they resort to the grain of the country to the
southward of them. But in the southern states
they manufacture spirits from molalTes, peach
es, apples, several kinds of grain, and probably
will, as their country is cleared, extend it to
the grape. This has been tried with success in
the experimental way, at Galliopolis, near the
Scioto,
The legislature of North-Carolina made a
loan of money since the late war, to aflift the
introduction of the paper manufactory.
An affbeiation, containing forty of the most
respeCtable planters arid farmers, in the western
, diftriiSt of South-Carolina, has been eftabliihed
within a few years for the promotion of manu
factures, and agriculture. A fubfeription to
the amount of about 25,000 dollars has been
made in the territory south of the Ohio, for the
purpose of carrying on the cotton manufactory.
An indication of zeal not equalled in any mid
dle err northern state, corifid?ring that the whole
population of the government is 3 3, 000 whites,
and j,ooo blacks.
The preparation of tar, pitch, turpentine,
spirits of turpentine, and rosin, in North-Caro
lina and its vicinity, may bedeeiried a manufac
ture as justly as the making of linseed oil, pot
ash, or ordinary tanning. A very small quanti
ty indeed, of these articles, will be made in the
dates north of Virginia, because nature forbids;
but they will, from obvious reasons, increase in
the south.
During the existence of the state impdft laws,
twoof the foQthern states (Maryland and Vir
ginia) imposed extra tonnage, not only upon fo
reign (hips, but upon those of the other states,
by which they evinced a strong disposition tt>
encourage the manujaflurc ofjhips. The fame
two states laid duties on the importation of spi
rits manufactured in the other parts of the
union,
The state of Maryland imposed considerable
protecting duties to encourage their own manu
factures. The legislature of Maryland have
encouraged the glass manufactory in that Itate
by a conliderable loan. That of Virginia pasT
ed a fpetial ast since the peace, to encourage
the manufiftory of fnuff and tobacco.
There ale more factories of cordage and cables
intwo of the'fouthern states, Maryland and Virgmia, than in any two oftlieftates ofNew-Jer
ley, New-York, Conne&icut, ancl New-Hamp-
Jhire. Virginia laid a dut* of two-thirds- of a
dollar on cordage by her state import: law.
The important manufactory of (hips has be
come greater in each of the three state s of Ma
ryland, Virginia, and North-Carolina, than it
now is in New-Hampfliire. The fouthem state
of Maryland manufactured in 1 as many ves
sels as any two of the northern states of New-
York, Coimeflicut, and II hode-Ifland.
The paper-mill in the United Sates, which is
mott remote from the Tea, is to be found in the
town of Saiein, in North-Carolina, three hun
dred miles from the lea. No such manufac
tures as those of that village (a Moravian set
tlement) in the southern fta*e of North-Caroli
na, exiit in any part of the uuion north of Ma
ryland, equally remote from the sea.
There is one fceneonly, in the Atlantic coun
ties, in which coal, iron, and waterfalls are
found together in abundance, That Â£cene, is
therefore, peculiarly qualified for the iron
branch of manufactures. The city of Rich
' mond on the banks of James' river, 111 Virginia,
which is the place contemplate !, may be conli-
in a permanent view as having an incon
"eftable natural advantage over anymore north
ern seaport in this interesting branch. How
profitable wou'd it be to Virginia, were all lier
pig and bar iron pafled under the tilt hammer*,
or through the rolling ai d flitting mills which i
might be ereeled at that place.
Some oi the produce of thefifheries, as before
observed, are to be deemed manufactures. The
herring and (had (or river and bay) filheries,
south of Penniylyania are very coofiderable. A
barrel of herrings is worth.- on a medium at the
fifliing places, 25 } cents. The manufacture of
the calk, the packing, curing, making pickle,
and trimmijig, amount to more "than one fourth
of the sum or tweritv-five per centum. The
calk and manufacturing of distilled spirits from
molaflVs, does not amount to more than one
sixth of tlie value of the commodity, or i6j per
cent. A barrel of pickled fijh of the foutiiern
states may be therefore as jultly deemed a ma
nufacture, as a calk of country rum. A fiinilar
comparison might be made between this article
and ieveral other fmiple manufactures of the
middle and eastern parts of the union. It is
not intended todifcufs the propriety of granting
bounties,but if they were deemed propergrants,
there are points of view in which the southern I
states would appear to have a greater intereftj
in them, than the eastern states.
1 ft. A', the southern states cultivate a greater
variety of raw articlesâand are capable of produc
ing a much larger quantity of them, all thatexten
five class of bounties, which are resolvable into
an encouragement to the-growth of therawina
terial, will be much more beneficial to them,
than to the eastern states, whichare more limit
ed both in the kinds and quantities they can;
bring forward for the bounty.
2dly. The southern states having extensive i
and very rich interior and western counties, far
from navigable*rivers, (which the eastern have
not) and the production of thole scenes being
liable to a long and expensive land carriage, I
the bounty would soon be found to enable them ]
to bring the simple manufactures and raw ma- i
terials to the markets 011 the lea coasts, which
they would not, without the bounty, attempt
to transport. This will not be deemed a mere
suggestion of ingenuity, when it is remembered
that the Britilh and Irilli give bounties on their
fabrics, and even on the bulky articles of flour,
grain, and biscuit, to enable the exporter to deliver
them with advantage in foreign markets.

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
April 3, 1792,
I'he report ef the committee of the -whole,
on the Secretary's Report on the Public
Debt, under consideration.
SHEREDINE moved an a -
-LÂ»-L mendinent to the sth resolu
tion, the purport to provide for tlie
aflmjiption of the (late debts paid,
Slid unpaidâthis was amended by Mr.
Madison, by adding the words " fiucel
the peace."
This motion was supported by Mr
Mercer, Mr. Madison, Mr. J. Smith'
and Mr. Findleyâand opposed by
Mr. Gerry, Mr. Ames, and several
others.
In support of the motion it was
laid, that the states adted as agents
for the United States, and that the
securities in the treasuries of parti
cular states, which had been paid,
were iouajide as much a debt against
the union, as the securities in the
hands of individuals.
To this it was replied, that the bu
siness at firft \>lufh mull appear im
practicableâfor it would be a revival
of the whole debts of the Hates incur
red during the whole war-and vva>
deviung a plan to tax the people in
the most grievous manner, merely for
the fake of raxing them.
This motion was determined in the
negativeâayes 26, noes 29.
Previous to the queliion's being
pur, Mr. Page made the following re
marks :â 1 ibonkl not, said he, trou
ble the House with my opinion, ref
peeting the amendment now piopol
ed,hadit not been determined to take
the ayes and noes on the occasionâ
as this is the cafe, and 1 fliall vote
agaiuft the motion, 1 will in a few
words afiign my realbns for so voting ;
they are theseâl look upon the rel'o
lution before you, Sir, as out of the
reach of any amendmentâas utterly
incapable of amendment â for theaf
fumption of the date debts always
appeared to me as impolitic, unjult,
and unconstitutional. No arnend
ment can now be offered to the rel'o
lution, which 1 shall not look upon as
thrown away, offered in vain, and
which 1 should not think myfelf bound
to rejecfl, with the whole resolution,
if adopted. 1 will not, after so much
has been said, take up your time, Sir,
to shew why 1 think the afUimption
of the state debts impolitic, unjust,
and unconstitutional; but I will pledge
myfelf, before the bill ever pass, to
carry these resolutions into effec r t, to
prove, at least to the fatisfaftion of a
considerable part of this House, that
it is soâat present, I fliall only de
clare this as my opinion, and (hall
vote ugainlt the amendmentâ-and if
that be received, or not, againlt the
original resolution.
APRIL 9.
In committee cf the whole on the Repreâ¢
fentation Bill.
The motion was to inferc 33,000 as
the ratioâoll this occafton the fol
lowing observations were made by
Mr. Page.âno arguniems have
been produced to convince me that
I was miltaken whew 1 voted tofill tip
the blank on a former occasion with
â  30,000 âanil indeed as nothiug has
been laid that can induce those who
voted with me 011 that occasion to al
ter their opinion, except lhac the Se
nate will not agree to any other ratio
than that proposed by themselves;
and that we ought to agree to a coin
promife with them. 1 lay, as tin's is
the cafe, 1 (hall vote as formerly for
filling up the blank with 30,000. As
to compromising, 1 have no idea of itâ
1 cannot make a compromise by which
1 inuft facrifice the interelfrs of my
constituentsâand as to yielding to
the wi/hes of the Senate upon this oc
casion, I think it unreasonable that
the direift representatives of the peo
ple, and a more numerous branch of
the legifJature, fliould give way thro'
mere complaifanee to the Senateâthis
would be contrary to the very prin
ciple of a republican government, that
the majority fliould be ruled by a mi
nority ; but what impropriety can
there be in fending up to the Senate
the bill filled up with the fame ratio
which was before sent to them. The
ratio of one to 30,000 has been adopt
ed by themâthe only difference be
tween us was, the application of that
ratio. We wished to apply it 10 the
lev era! slates according to their num
bers refpetftively ; the Senate, to the
whole number of all the ftaies ; and
the other branch of the legiilatui e has
refufed its aflent, not to the ratio, but
to this application of itâwe ought
not therefore to suppose, if we apply
that ratio conftitutionally,that the bill
will be again refufed. 1 cannot sup.
pose that the Senate would be so in
flexible as not to yield to the repeated
wilhes exprefled by the votes of this
House and that too, in a cafe in
which this house and its conflituents,
alone 1 may fay, are peculiarly inter
etted. In fliort, if we are to propose
to fill up the blank with no other
number but such as gentlemen tell us
the Senate will agree to, I will fit
down, and never wish to rife here
again ; for surely if this be our cafe
this House is ulelefsâand it mult be
to no purpose to make any motion,
until the Senate have been confnltedl
whether they will agree to it or not

MADRAS, December 29.
THE Cyngalefe, whose depreda
tions were mentioned in a for
mer courier, are now preparing for a
grand attack on the polleiiions of the
Dutch, on the Ifiand of Ceylon, in
which it is 10 be hoped they will not

ineiit their perfidy so amply merits.
Capture of Sevtrn fit oug.
On the 21ft, Lord Cornwallis, ac
companied byGeneral Meadows, went
down to the Batteries, and there de
termined on an immediate allault,
which was accotdingly carried iuio
execution in the following order :
The Light Infantry of his Majesty's
76th, leading the dorm, were covered
by the Grenadiers of the 2d regiment,
in ihe centre, and the Grenadiers of
the 76th, in the rear, under the com
mand of Capt. Gage, with orders, on
entering the breach to rti/h forward
on the left hand, if poflible, gain the
fumtnit of the mountain \v hi lit the
Hon. Captain Lindfay, with the Gre
nadiers of the 7rft" and 72d regiment
was,oll entering the breach,Co attempt
the accomplishment of the fame pur
pose to the right : where Capt Ro
bertfon, of his Majesty's 71 ft regiment
with two companies, his own and the
Light Infantry, of the 72d regiment,
also led an attack as did the Hon. Capt.
Monfon of his Majesty's 52d regiment
with his own Light infantry company.
The storm commenced about 10
o'clock in the morningâOur Troops
dalhed on with firmnel's and intrepi
dity not to be refilledâand in the
short space of one hour and five mi
mites, gallantly carried the whole of
the enemy's works, without the loss
of a man.
The garrison appeared bewildered
in aftoniflnnent, and the only refin
ance they made, was at the attack led
by Capt. Monfon, who forced two
gates.
Severn Droug, is about twelve miles
to the Weft ward of Bangalore .
is a mountain of considerable magi,
tnde, and is said to be upwards of ;
mile in perpendicular height â twi
thirds of it is impregnable, and the
only part where access is polfibleâ
is interrupted by deep chasms, thai
form a superior kind of natural ditcli
â the lower part of the Mountain is
defended by a fort, or rather a chain
of fortifications, running over de
tached rocks and the funimit, is crown
ed with a work, which a few deter
mined men might in great fafety
maintain against an Army.
1 he capture of Severn Droug, is of
the utmost consequence, taking it ei
ther in a local or political point of
view : under the former ii secures
protection to fifty thousand Brenga
ries, who will now be enabled to
bring in their supplies to the army
free from apprehensionâand under
the latter it cannot fail of making a
very deep inipreflion oil the minds of
Tippoo's troops.
Capt. Beatfon is ordered by his
Lordship, to examine the roads, and
woods, to the right and lefc of the
general route to Seringapatam : he
inarched with a party for that pui -
pose on the ift instant.

The following nervous and beau

whofeconded the address to the King,
on the opening of the present feUion

an Epglifh reader.â i
*' For* ftiyfelf, I am glad of this op

his grateful fubjetfts.âBut I an> at

are in all countries, and particularly

Philadelphia, June 6.
Bytwo French Oilps a. , ived at Norfolk, Virginia,
in forty-five days from France, we learnâThat as

and Â» lie Cou.it d'Arauda Vice-Piefidcnt.âThat
the Tribunal of policy created by the ix-Mtnifier,

is no doubt hut that Spain will returntotfiofe pr'in

i. e. to look upon Fiance as a natural ally, whole
friendftiip cannot be departed froin without cx
poling herlell to the fame calamities Ore underwent
befoic the treaty of Utrecht, and the introduction
ol a King of the Bourbon family.âThat the Count
d'Cifuciites (who was President of Caflillc, and a
Iriend to Florida Blancha) having died suddenly,
the Kir.g appoint-d Don Juan d'Anzedorico (an
upright inagiftrate) as Governor oi that Council, to
i he general fatisfaÂ£tion of the people of Madrid.
That fincc the dismission of Couut Florida Blan

in a convent of FYancifcan Fryars) the Chevalier de
Burgoin, and M. d'Durtuby, the French Envoys,
have fettled at Court, and that Count d'Aranda has
piomil'ed that every fatisfadlion Iball be given to
the grievances of the French nation, and of indi

and the death ot Leopold have cut off the head
and arms of the artftocratic party in France. â
The captain, of the above ihips further inform,
that the aflignats had taken a rife, and for a dis

When we take into consideration the many im

The circumllances which have led to these re
flections, have originated from the performance of
a curious Fire Engine, conftrufted by Mr. Richard
Mason, of this city, for the Diligence Fire Com
pany ; and however astonishing it may appear, yet
it is a fact that may be relied on, that on Saturday
last, when the Diligence Fire Engine was played
horizontally, the water was thrown to the dtftance
of one eighty feet, arid when moved
to Christ Church yard, and played in a perpendi
cular direction (although with an unfavorable
w inu} the water was then thrown to the perpendi -
cuiar height of one hundied and sixty-six feet, and
within three feet of the four windows at the upper
extremity of the ficrple. As the performance of
this Engine so considerably exceeds anv. others in
Amcrica in dilcharging such a body of water with
so much force and to such a distance, would it not
be advifeable for the different fire companies to
prt fer such fire engines as the Diligence and'Hi
hernia, so the finaller ones which have been in ge
neral use in Philadelphia ? Fed. Gaz.
M. dp Gardnqui, who succeeds M. de Lerena,

We hear from South-Carolina, that the extra

" Such is the temper of the people of France
at this time, that both republicans and aristo
crats feein alike regard'efs of the dreadful con
sequences of civil commotions. The rhotto of
both isâ" Success attend our cause, and no
matter for the reft." The republican thermo
meter, however, seems not so high as that of
the sticklers for the old government. These
are every where fomenting internal troubles,
principally by means of the priests, who are al
ways, on such occasions, the instruments of po
pular deception ; and upon these deftriiftive
agents, the counter-revolutionists reft their'
principal hopes cf success." Leyden Cat.

It is particularly worthy of notice? (fays a
correspondent) that no denial has ever appear
ed of the direct and multiplied aflertions, that
tie members of the general government have
carried on job fa and fpcculatiuns in tlieir own
meafures,even uiki/Jl tfwfe measures were depending.
If these charges be true, can any thing be more
difgraceful to the councils of a free country, or
more loudly call for the indignation of a virtu
ous people ? If they are not true, why are they
not denied, and, as far as the cafe will admit,
disproved by appealing to circumstances which
can be investigated ? Instead of being denied,
however, the public has been insulted with at
tempts to slur the matter over by mysterious
and unmeaning paragraphs, the low virulence
'of personal abuse, or, what is worse, by sugges
tions that thole who warn the people against
Peculating andilock-jobbing corruptions in the
government, are enemies to the government
and to the people themselves. Nat. Gaz.
Nothing can equal the malignant effrontery
((ays a correspondent) of certain paragraph writers
in certain newspapers. They deal out general, in
difcrirninate insinuations againfl members of the
government, without ipecifying either persons or
tacts, and they then rail at all concerned in it, be
cause no body comes forward to deny or disprove.
Is any individual to suppose himfelf particularly
aimed at, when a general charge is made against a
number, and to single himfelf out in a newspaper
as t,he vindicator of his innocence? If any man
were weak enough to do it, he would inftantlv be
tola, and rightly, that if he had not been confeious
of guilty he would not have supposed himfelf fuf
pefled. Frpm what too is a man to vindicate him
felf, when no fpecific chaige is made, no fpecific
faÂ£t alledgcd ? Speculation and jobbing, charged
in the lump, are as vague as witchcraft and heresy.
Any man who expeÂ£ls to put another upon his de
fence before the tribunal of the public, ought to
come forward and ailedge that A. or B. has done
this or that ill thingâhe should lay his finger on
the fact ; else he can neither mean nor expeÂ£l to be
anfweied. He makes his chargcs to alarm the
community with ill-grounded fears, and he affects
lo complain that '.hey are not anfweied ,to ftrcngthen
aJufpiiion v-hich he knows to have no foundation.
To fuÂ«;h ge r nejal aspersions it is fufficientto anlweri
generally, that there are many members of
vernmcnt, and among them ihofe who have had a
chtej agenc) in the measures mod bitterly cenfuied
by the Faction, w>.o can conscientiously and
boldly give a flat denial to every imputation of in
terefied or sinister motivesâwho are absolutely
fiee from every thing that is called speculation and
jobbing. Who dare compare the whole tenor of
their lives and conduct on the score of difinterefh
ednefs and exaÂ£l probity, with any of the mollj
canting pretendeisto superior purity among their
opponents, and who mufl ever feel themselves
humbled by a comparison on those points with
moft*of those who are loudest in their harangues on
the love of liberty, and the love of virtue.
Some persons are very wife in regard to the
dciigns of others. They chatter about the par
tisans of* Kingly power, and affe<st to consider
the plan of subverting our republican govern
ment and free conilitution as well matured, and
that great numbers are engaged in it. The
certificate men, the stockholders of the bank,
the tools of the ministry, the aristocrats, are all
conspirators against liberty; in fliort, all the
men who wifli to buoy up the prefentgovernment.â
Strange ! that a plan against liberty and the
coriftitution ftiould be supported by thole who
are ridiculed fjr puffing the const tution and the
present happy condition of the union, and above
all, who are for buoying up the government. If
a revolution of government is to be attempted,
will it be firft espoused by those whose property
depends on the preservation of the prelent state
of things ? These men are represented as wholly
void of public principle, and mindful only of
gainâand, in the next breath, as blinded by en
thufiafni against liberty to such a degree, as to
put all the property they hold under the present
government, at hazard, for the fake of over
throwing it;, and setting up a despotism. Is not
the constitution a free one \ It is. Is it not
plain that all the property created by the bank
and funding system depends on preserving the
constitution unchanged ? Surely those men will
not be the least friendly to liberty, who willlofe
most by its overthrow. Or, will our wife ones
pretend that men of property are the firft to plot
revolution* &nd civil convulsions ?
But thcffe Mlo delight to cry knave, (pecula
tor, aristocrat, and kingly power, take both
fides of a Â£011 tradition, and maintain each with
equal good temper and good sense.
The constitution of the United States is so
happily conllrufted, that liberty and property
are inseparably connected with a firm support oi
its principlesâthis is the grand desideratum ir
government, the want of which, has too often
led the affluent in mod countries to plot thelub
verfion of freedom, rn order the more effedualiy
to preserve their poifefiions.
In this enlightened period of the world, we
are astonished at reflecting on the conduct of
those delpots, who having had it in their power
to command with the wealth and personal ser
vices of mankind, their friendfhip andj admira
tion, excited their abhorrence while living, and
left their memories to the execrations of all
succeeding ages.
Mankind, by a just and wife government,
may be formed to goodness, greatness and true
gloryâbut to fay that the order and happiness
of society, and much more, sublimity of charac
ter, do not depend on government, is faying
that effects may be produced without a Cause.
It will very soon be found out among other dit
coveries, that government and laws are the
greatest bore that the world of mankind ever
fuifered.

veyed in the mail, and be by such Post-masters
delivered to the mail carriers to be lodged as
they pass at the Jlands here referred to. But
as the Post-masters are rfcfponfible for the post
ages of all newspapers by them delivered, such
subscribers niuft either pay the postages in ad
vance, or make engagements to the fatisfa&ion
of the post-masters refpe&ively for the payment
thereof, monthly or quarterly, as they can agree.
3d. It is desirable that such news-papers as
are to be conveyed in the mail fhouldbe driedâ
This will reduce their weight about one third ;
and at the fame time secure their delivery in
good orderânews-papers put up damp from the
pjefs, often get injured in the carriage, their
covers are worn off, and their directions ren
dered illegible.
4th. These modes of conveying news-papers
are proposed as the most eligible which at pre
sent occurâlf others more convenient fliould be
devised, they will be readily adopted.

WE the subscribers, weavers of the city of
Philadelphia, attended this day, Thursday
May 24th, at Mr. Pearce's Cotton Manu
factory, No. 13, Pcim-ftreet, to view his ma
chinery ; mod of us are Europeans,and do all agree,
that his abilities in mechanWm are superior to any
we ever saw, especially in his double loom, in
which one man can weave two pieces at the fame
time, 42 inches wide, with equal facility to one
piece in the common loom; this ufeful loom,
when examined, appears simple, the art of work
ing it soon attained, and the extra expence very
small ; his machines for carding and roping are
excellent, and all the reft of the utensils prepared
for the business are contrived with judgment',
the whole of which we hope will soon come into
general use, and be found of great utility in the
United States.

PASSED AT THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS:
COLLATED WITH, AND CORRECTED BY THE ORIGINAL
ROLLS IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
Price One Quaitcr of a Dollar.
THE ACTS of this fellion, agreeably to the plan of this edi
tion of the laws of the United States, will be confidcrcd as the
FIRST FART of the second volume; so that the aÂ£ts of each
Congress (the duration of which is limited by the conflitution to
the term of two years) will be comprised in one volume.
To the acts of this fcflion will be annexed the ratifications of
the amendments to the Constitution ; the confederation between
the United States and the Delaware nation of Indians ; the trealy
between the United States and the Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa,
Chippewa, I'attawatimi and Sac Nations; the treaty between
the United States and the Cherokee Nation; and the armistice,
declaring a celfation of hoftilitieÂ» between the United Slates and
Great-Britain: These, with those in the firft volume of the laws
are all the existing treaties.
A copious index will accompany the second volume when
completed, at ihe end of the next feflion ol Congress.
" As it is desirable that copies of the laws (hould be so multi
plied throughout the States, and in such cheap forms,as that every
citizen ofthe United States may be able to procure them," it has
been thought advifeahle, in this addition, 10 omit the ftgnatures
of the Prelident of the United States, the f'rclident of the Senate,
and the Speaker of the House of Rcprefentatives. Their signa
tures would have increased thefizeof the volume, and co<ifequcnt

nefs or authenticity, mafmuch as the Secretary of State's certificate
is to be prefixed to th< volume.
