[No. 22, of Vol. lII.]
FROM THE (BOSTON) COLUMBIAN CENTINEL.
Mr. RUSSELL,
~E> Y the English Constitution, the whole collec
tive power of the nation is delegated, and
the constitution itfelf is alterable by the fame au
thority which is competent to the common pur
poses of legislation.
Ihe trench are to have a constitution, every
part of which will be nominally beyond thecon
troul of their common legislatures, and which
will be unalterable in all parts, except by the na
tion in its " original character." Ac least Mr.
Paine has undertaken to anfvrer for them that it
will be so: Although I have not seen any such
article in the constitution, and though perhaps
it has not yen been decreed, I am willing to take
Mr. Paine's word for the fadi, and to conlider
the fubjetft, as if it were already determined.
I have made some observations upon Mr. Pa ine's
arguments, as they refpetf: the right of a nation
to delegate all their power. As a question of ex
pediency, it may perhaps be more difficult to de
termine, which of these two schemes contains
the least evil. Both of them are fuppovted by
the example of several among the American
States, and can therefore boalt the fantfiion of
authorities equally refpeitable.
Ihe fundamental principle upon which soci
ety is formed, appears to be, in order that the
power of the whole may be rendered subservient
to the interests of the whole. The problem to
solve is, in what manner the power shall be dis
tributed, so as most effeiftually to answer that
purpose. Confldering the extreme difficulty with
which a whole nation can be brought to atfl in
their original chara<ster, it should seem, that wis
dom mult didlate to them the necessity of dele
gating their whole power, in such a manner as
that it may be rendered beneficial to the nation,
because whatever power is retained by the peo
ple, cannot be exercised for their advantage,
any more than to their injury. The question
therefore occurs, why a nation should not dele
gate all its powers > Mr. Paine has bestowed ve
ry little Cpi.fir'erstion upon this fubje<a ; I fnm
that although he gives us his own opinion very
fieely, he offers only two reafoits to support it.
One, because, " such a government would be ar
bitrary The other, because " there is a para
dox in the idea of vitiated bodies reforming
themfelyes." In the sense in which the word
binary is here used, the firft argument attacks
the foundation of civil society itfelf ; for when
ever a number of individuals aflociate together
and form themselves into a body-politick, called
a nation, the poflL-ffion and the ufi of the whole
pov.er, (which is not however arbitrary power,)
is the very objeift of their allociation. This pow
er must exist Come where, and I cannot fee the
reason why it should not exist for the benefit of
the people.âBut wheneveraconftitution ismade
unalterable by the common legislative authority,
the naiion do in reality abdicate all the powers
which they are laid to retain,and declare that very
important powers (hall at all events be useless to
t hem, from an apprehension that they might pof
fiblv be abused to their injury.âlt is as if a man
should bind himfelf never to wear a sword, left
lie should turn it against his own breast. The
only reason why the whole power of a nation
should not be delegated, mult arise from the dan
ger of us being abused: And a melancholy ex
perience has always shown that when the whole
power has been thus delegated to one mau, or to
one body of men, it has invariably been grossly
abused, and the sword of the people has been
turned into a dagger against them. From the
the predure of thole evils, many nations have
been induced exprcfsly to forbid their govern
ments the use of certain powers, without consi
dering that the impotence of their supreme au
thority, would certainly be very prejudicial to
them, and perhaps as fatal, as the abuse of pow
er. This experiment has repeatedly been made;
i t has frequently failed ; and I believe that after
several more experiments shall fully demonstrate
the ill policy of thus annihilating the power of
the nation, it will be clearly seen, that all the
powers of the people ought to be delegated for
their benefit, and that their true interest consists
in the distribution of those powers in fucha inan
rer as (hall in its own operation guard against
theabufes which alone are dangerous to the neo-

French and of the Englifti, while it has avoided
.he evils of both. By that constitution, the peo
ple have delegated the power of alteration, by
veiling it in the CongrL-fs, together with the
Mate Legislatures ; while at the fame time it has
provided for alterations by the people themselves
in their original charadler. whenever it shall evi
dently appear to be the wuhof the people to make
them. This article appears to be replete with
wisdom ; I believe it will stand the celt of the se
verest examination, though according to the ideas
emanating from Mr. Paije, and coming to us at
the I'ania tune by refle<fti( r .i from the Secretary of
State, it contains a very tiangeroua political he
resy.
It is a maxim which wi not I trust, be dispu
ted, that no government of which the people is
not a conftuuent part, an secure their equal
rights ; but where this is the cafe, to cramp the
operations of their own government, with un
neceflary reftritfions, and forbid themselves to
enact ufeful laws, what : s it but to defeat the
purposes of society, by t'. ; very art, which gives
it a permanent existence; to tie theirown hands
from an imaginary appre' enfion that if left at
liberty they would admii fterpoifon to thebody
which nourishes them ?
It is in the distribution >f the national powers;
it is in the independent fj irit of the people, and
not in the manuscript limitation of the Legisla
tive authority, that a nar jn is to secure the p; o
tecftion of its liberties.â] this Commonwealth
we have a constitution, mi ft parts of which are
unalterable by ouk- ordinary Legislatures; it has
existed but ten years ; an already its operation
has convinced us all tha several alterations in
the system would be highl ' expedient. Our Le
gislative body would be fully competent to the
purpose, and if they had ihe power would rea
dily make such alterations as might suit the con
venience of the people; but they have no autho
rity ro a<ft in these cases for the benefit of the
people, and as the inconveniences to which this
injudicious jealousy has fubjecled us, are not
'-!* this time fucii iiiipti?\aiice as to render the
alterations, of immediate or absolute neceflity,
we must wait our appointed time, and patiently
submit to the operation of bad laws, because we
have not chol'en to invert our Legislature with
the power of making good ones.âLet us not be
frightened, however, from the pursuit of our
common interelt by the words arbitrary power.
Distribute the whole of your power in such a
manner, as will neceflarily prevent anyone man,
or body of men, or any poflible combination of
individual interests, from being arbitrary, but do
not encumber your own reprefenratives with
fliackles, prejudicial to your own interests; nor
fuffer yourselves like the Spanilh Monarch, of ri
diculous memory, to be loafted to death, by de
nying to your fervantsthe power of removingtlie
fire from before you
But although a constitution, profefledly unal
terable by the common legislative authority, is
of weight fufficient to prevent the enading of
many good lawn, yet it will not always opera*e as a
check upon your legislature. Such is the pover
ty of all human labours, that even a whole na-
tion cannot exprcfs themselves upon paper, with
To much accuracy and precision, as not to admit
of much latitude of explanation and eÂ»nftruc
tion. Thelegiflature must always be allowed to
judge of the intentions with which the instru
ment was formed, and to construe and explain
accordingly the expressions which it contains.
They fonietimes think proper to violate the let
ter' of the constitution by adhering to its spirit,
and at other times they facrifice the spirit by ad
heriug ftri(flly to the letter. But when vour le
gislature undertake to decide that the Ipirit of
the constitution, is diredly contrary to its express
letter, where is the power in the nation that
lhould controul them i The fame power, which
will al ways be ftifficient to controul a Legislature
of which the peopie are a constituent part; it is
ihefpint of the people.âLet your Legislative and'
Executive authorities be so constituted, as to pre
vent every eflential, or dangerous abuse of the
powers delegated, but depend upon the honest
and enlightened spirit of the people for a fecuri
nty which you never will obtain, by merely with
holding your powers, unless that spirit fhotfld be
constantly kept up. Divide your power so that
every part of it may at all times be used foryour
advantage, but in luch a manner that your rights
may never depend upon the will of any one man

when ac the lame time it may be impolfible for
you to act in your original character, with the
expedition neceff'ary for your salvation ; but re
ierve to yonrfelves a concurrent power of alter
lng the constitution in your own persons, becauf<
by the decay to which all the works of man an

eases, and no more involves an absurdity, than
hat a phyflcian should use his own prescriptions

ipprobation, from the general convirtion of is

>i oper that the power lnouJa be deieo-ated Up
'n. the principles of equal liberty, upon the
irinciples of public liappmefs, and therefore of
Jolitical expediency, I think it may be fairly
_oncluded that Mr. Paink's preference of the

relates to this article, is not founded in truth.

This being done, it rnuft be perfectly soaked in

ON behalf of the inhabitants of the borough
of Lancaster, the members of the Corpora

rival at this place. On this joyful occasion, they
approach the First Magiftrateot the Union, with
hearts imprefied with no less grateful respect
thin their fellow-citizens of the east and ot the
south. With them they have admired those ta
lents, and that firm prudence in the field, which
finally enfuved success to the American arms.
But at this time reverence forbids the language
â which would naturally flow from the recapitula
tion of the events of the late glorious revolution.
The faithful page of liiftory will record your
jllnftrious actions for posterity.âYet we cannot
forbear to mention what we, in our day, have
beheld and witnefl'ed. We have seen you, at
the awful period, when the storm of war was
burlting around us, and our fertile plains were
deluged with the richelt blood of America, ri
ling above adverfiry, and exerting all the talents
of the patriot and the hero, to save our country
from the threatened ruin : And when, by the
will of Heaven, those exertions had restored
peace and profperiry to the United Stares, and
the great objecft fur which you drew the sword,
was acconipliihed, we have beheld you, adorn
ed with every private, social virtue, mingling
â¢with your fellow-citizens. Yet that tranfcend
ant love of country, by which you have always
been actuated, did no! fuffer you to reft here ; â
but when the united voice of myriads of free
men (your fellow-citizens) called you from the
repose of domestic life, actuated f'olely by the
principles of true gloryânot seeking your own
aggrandizement , but fact ifking the sweets of
reti'ed life to the wiflies and happiness of your

confidence of a great people, presiding over their
and, by your happy adminift'-ation,
â uniting them together by the great political bond
of one common interest.
It is therefore the inhabitants of this borough,
seize with joy the only opportunity which has
offered to them, to teftify their approbation of,
and their gratitude for. your services.

themselves as Britons, as flatefmen and Christi
ans, b'U must eventually, as the light of evi
dence shall be more and more diffufed, be se
conded by the good wilhes of every man not
immediately interested in the continuance of
that detellabls commerce.
Resolved,
That anticipating the opposition we should
have to sustain from persons trained to a fami
liarity with the rapine and desolation neceflarily
attendant on the ilave trade, and sensible also
â¢)f the prejudices which implicitly arise from
long established usages, this committee consider
the late decision in the house of commons as a
delay rather than a defeat. In addrefling a
free and enlightened nation on a fubjeifl in
which its justice, humanity and wisdom are in
volved, we cannot despair of final success ; and
we do hereby, under an encreailng conviction ot
the excellence of our cause, and in conformity
to the distinguished examples before us, reneyc
our firm panellation, that we will never desist
from appealing to the consciences of our coun
trymen till the commercial intercourse wiih
Africa (hall cease to be polluted with the blood
of its inhabitants.
By order of the Committee,
Granville Sharp, Chairman.
PITTSBURGH, July 2
Thursday evening last arrived here from De
rroit, which place he left the 10th ult. from cap
tivity among the savages, Mr. Thomas Ray, \vh
was taken from Cuffawago by four Indians fomt
time ago. Mr. Bay has related to us the follow
ing, viz. At the time he was taken the Indians
killed and scalped one William Gregg; the)
then proceeded to Sandulky, where a pai:yol
Indians had just returned from committing de
predations 011 the frontiers of Ohio count j, who
were about halt drunk, and they beat hiin in a
cruel manner. Seven days after his arrival
there, news came in that our army was 011 their
march, against that place, upon which they
hurnt the houses and deltroyed the corn they
had planted, and removed their families offto
the rapid of the Miami river; at that place ht
favr a great many Indians, to the amount of'twc
or threethoufand, receive arms and ammuni ion
and proceed on to the Ma 11 inee towns, where, i
was said, 7000 were affeinbled,; that at Detro",
011 the ftrft Thursday of June, at a review of the
militia, he saw Ijo turn out voluntarily to join
the Indians ; that he saw a number nf Indians,
to the amount of 17 or 18 canoe load, who said
they had been three moons on their journey
come to join the others; they had bows and and
arrows, and had otter {kins for breech clouts
and bufftiloe Ikins instead of blankets ; that a
bout the Ift or 2d of J line the Indians brought i
12 scalps, together with the guns, bayonets, &c.
belonging to the party; that he saw Thomas
Dick and his wile, who were taken from nea:
this place, in good health at the Miami River,
and the boy, by the name of Brickel, with his
head Ihaved and painted, on his way with a
party to the Maumee towns. Mr. Raywasbought
from the Indians by a Britifti officer by whom he
was released.
Mr. Ray further informs, that the Indians en
tirely blame Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hamilton, as
being the cause of the Indians being killed on
Beaver creek, and fay, if they ever Ihould fall
into their hands, they would put them to death
in the molt cruel manner.

Aristocracy is in a deep and rapid decline; In
the example of the United Stats, the world
has seen, that the energy and dig.ii:y of govern
ment may be combined wiih the jult rind equal
Rights of Men. Power ought ever to spring from
the People--atid being delegated for a given
timeâthose who life it, mull at the expiration of"
that time, revert to the general mass, and there
by be fubjecfl to every adt which is the execution
of that power, they have made. Thus arises a
security paramount to all others. Hereditary ex
ecutives, and hereditary Legiflarors are now ra
pidly growing into political tnonftersâwhile the

Republicanism is every day growing more amia

Philadelphia, July 15.
Sunday evening an cxprefs arrived from Pittsburgh with dis
patches from Major General Butler, which were immediately
laid betore the Prehdent ot the United States, by theSecietary oi
the Department ot War.
The following article lately appeared in an
American newspaper, viz. " r tie re is one all'er
don ot'ihe author, which, as lie defends it, from
the experience of hiltory, and the actual ltaie
of the world at this day, caÂ«not otherwise than
claim fotne attention, viz. Th.it religion (its the
word is generally utidei Itood) is not uirtiu. Ihe
Jews (fays he) were eminently pure in their
worshipâthe Egyptians and the Persians were
(to them) Idolaters and Atneiltsâthe morals of
the latter were good, those of the former abo
minableâRome, when (he produced the virtues
of Decius and r'abricius, was pagan and atheilt.
Constantinople was the reservoir of all the molt
detestable vices, after Conltantine had intro
duced the Chriltiau religion.âWe have Apolto
lic, Catholic and molt Christian Kings; but no
Titus, no Trajan, no Antoninus. Modern Rome
in appearance is nothing but religion ; what
philosopher would compareit wi. h ancient Rome,
in refpetS to talents, industry, or merit ? Reason
therefore concludes that rehgioti is not virtue."
It may be called modern refinement, but it is
not a new thing under the fun, that men lhould
seriously propose to eradicate morality from the
world.â Ihe companions contained in the above
paragraph have a very obvious meaning ; they
aie designed to make the molt unfavorable im
prellions on the public mind in regard to the re
ligion profeiied in the United States, and in al
uioit every other civilized country. " .Religion
.s not virtue," âthat is, chriltianity is inferior to
paganifin !âCivilization is inferior to nature in
aer rudelt forms ! âThe idolatry of the Egyp
lians was superior to Judaism ! How prepolte
rous and absurd ! In one breath we are told that
<he world is making the most rapid progress in
civilization and reformationâin tlic next we
are referred to pajl ages as models for our imita
tion!â Pagan, atheiltical Rome produced her
Fabricius and her Deciusâchristianized Constan
tinople was the reservoir of the most detestable
wees ! But was there no religion in Rome before
chriltianity was introduced Let impartial histo
ry determineâWhen Rome w.is religious she was
ioral, she was free, flourifhing and happy
'Vlien religion declined, the Gods were con
emned, and their worlhip was despised, Rome
became venal, vicious, vile and contemptible,
lie people lolt their moral character and with
hat thiÂ°y lolt their- freedom. -A few virtnous
nen appeared in the decline of the empire, ar
icftedits fate, and protratfled its existence.
she introduction of chriltianity by Conftantine
in all probability added a thousand years to the
â¢ ge of the governmentâlmmediately before the
tVeedam of Rome was annihilated by the Csefars,
every species of villainy that springs from infi
del principles was rampant through ihe com
monweal! hâand when similar practices, ori simi
lar pi inciples, had filled up the measure of their
iniquities, heaven permitted Mahomet to annihi
late the empire of the eaft.âlt is abundantly e
vident from the feftimony of history, that the
deity governs the world by moral principles
without refpe<ft to particular religions tenetsâ
1 he prolperity of nations bears an exart pronor
uon to their practice of the moral virtues, and
and when these become extinifl among a people
their freedom and happiness soon follow.â '
" Religion is not virtue"âgrant itâbut till
we can find virtue without religion, I trust in
God that the good people of the United States
will not, at the inltance of any foreign or domestic
infidel part with their religionâlt has been of
service in times pad ; for though they may have
been deceived by rcligioui charaders without vir
tue. it is equally true that they never found a
virtuous character destitute of religion.

"On the ninth day we reached Newtown
where the Indian treaty is to be held, becaufi
rhe waters are too low to permit the boats wit!
pt efents and provision* to grf up to the Paintec
Port. We alighted at Col. Pickering's lodgings,
and found hiin conferring with feme Oneida
and other Eaflern Indians, who have conic down
with a view to mediate a peace. Their chief,
Hendvick Apanmiit, the samÂ« from whom I fe
ceived a letter some time finre, was speaking
when we entered: "The little Tomahawk the
Indians fight with," said he, " colls them very
little. They can kill game with it, Â«nd support
themselves ; but the Great Hatchet that the

United States use in war cods a great deal; ar.d
those who carry it into our country mult be pr o

the United States are so powerful that they
could rife and dettroy all the Indians at onre.-l
It is true, they are too power fnl for the Indians â¢
but remember, tho' you may kill some wolves'
and frighten the reft away, you cannot deltroy
them all. They will return and infelt von ] t
were therefore much better for the United States
to live in peace with the Indians. A great while
ago, ourselves and the Shavvanefe were one peo

we separated to seek for food. We still speak
the fame language. lam willing to go to thein
and persuade them to peace. All o.her Indians
know that we have always been friends to the
English. They all acknowledge we know more
about the white people than they do. If I
I know it will be at the risque of my life. Per
haps your warriors will arrive at the fame time,
and then nothing can be done. I therefore
want to fee some of your Great Men. If they
will keep your young men at home, I will go.
Perhaps I may be able to induce their Chiefs to
come down and treat with your Great Men
about a lasting peace." This offer is now under
consideration. We hear that about Booofthe
Six Nation Indians will be at the Painted Poll to
day. They are expeAed here by the end of
the week; but it is not likely that the treaty
will beheld before the 27th or 30th of the month.
After which we hope a week or ten days will re-
Itore us to our friends and the comforts of civi

that its beautiful situation is not furpafl" d, if equalled by any ; be

to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by realon of the flats, this wharf is necefTarily extended to the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the most extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3~4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and (he towns adjacent, but th
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. Thi
general wish that prevails in the minds of all clafles of people, for
the success of this enterprize, together with the very great advan
