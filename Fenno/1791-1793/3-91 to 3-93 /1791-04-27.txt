BUT amidst all these scenes of anarchy, car
nage and defolatiori, aiul aniidit so many
pretentions to reformation, were there no pro
jects to change the form of government?â Yes,
there were ; and lonie persons appeared as zea
lous to deltroy the monarchy and nobility at that
time, as any of the national allembly, any of the
men of letters, or public creditors of the present
day in Fiance. One of these has left an ellaylo
â very curious that it is worth preserving : It con
tains all that can be said or thought, as far as I
know, against monarchy and nobility, and (liows
that the dodtrines which now prevail in France
are no new discoveries or inventions : They are
nearly two hundred and fifty years old. Neither
Turgot, Rochefoucaulr, or Condorcet, have the
merit of these invention?. Stephen Boetius, as
we learn from his friend Montaigne, died in
1563. His vehement Philippic against monarchy
and ariltocracy, mult have been written therefore
more than 230 years agoâit mult have been writ
ten an hundred years before Marchement Ned
ham's Right Constitution of a Commonwealth.
Inllead of taking praise to themselves, the men
of letters in France, if their present systems fuc
ceecLand prosper, ought to eredl statues and llrike
medals to Boetius and Nedham, whose political
dilciples they certainly are.
If by divine power a man flioukl be miracu
loufly formed of mature reason and full informa
tion of every thing, but men, nations and go
vernments : and you Ihould aik hiin, what he
thought of tWenty-five millions of men, compo
fmg the whole of a great nation, furrenderii.g
the whole sovereign legislative and executive
power over themselves to one individual, and or
daining that all that power should descend to his
male pofteriry forever ; he would probably think
it the moll irrational, and ridiculous idea ima
ginable. If you were to tell him that alrriofl:
all the nations of the earth had done it, he mull
be aftonilhed and very inquisitive to be informed
of the causes, physical, moral or political,
â which could have prevailed upon reasonable
creatures to consent to such an inllitution. Is
there any other answer that could be given to
him than this ? Mankind found by experience,
government necellary to the preservation of their
lives, liberties and properties, from the iujuftice
of one another. That they had tried all poffi
ble'experiments of elections of Governors and
Senates: But that they had found so much di
â verfity of opinion and sentiment among them.
So much emulation in every heart, so many ri
valries among the principal men, such divisions,
confufions and miseries, that they had almoll
unanimously been convinced that hereditary fuc
cefiion was attended with fewer evils than fre
quent elections. This is the true answer, and
the only one, as 1 believe.
It is to be regretted that Boetius, who disco
vered so much ingenuity in reasoning against the
one, and the few, had not told the many, how
they (hould govern themselves. He is for pujl
ingdown, but (hows not how to build up. That
lie who abates a writ ihould give a better, is as
reasonable a rule in legislation as in law. If
Boetius, or the National Mlembly had proposed
a sovereignty in three branches forming a mutual
balance, whi?h would have prevenred the one,
the few and many from running into the fins
that molt easily beset them ; they would have
teen justly applauded : but to throw the whole
power into the hands of a majority of that mul
titude against which Boeiius raves with more in
temperance, if poflible, he does against
Kings, is an experiment which must be fully tri
ed and found beneficial before it can be appro
ved. But as the reader will be more entertained
and inftrurted by the discourse of Boetius, than
w ith the discourse on Davila, he shall be no long
er detained from it.

of their properly, that is to fay before their civil
government was determined on, several Bifliops
b'gan to thunder foith their Anathemas againii
the proceedings of the National Aflembly, under
cover of" certain writings called Mandates, or
P ditoral letters. The refufal of the National As
fembly to eltablifti the Roman C atholic religion,
furniihed them with an occasion for writing and
circularing their inflammatory productions, the
whole view and design of which was to alarm
weak understandings and by universally spread
ing discontent throughout the Nation, to obligt
the Aflembly to defiit from their determination
of granting freeclorji of conscience. In the large
cities, and even in the Provinces, where the pen
pie were not wholly unenlightened, the poison of.
those Holy mj n could do no harm â¢; but in the
cantons where ignorance and superstition (till
maintain their influence over the minds of men
(places, fortunately, at this day no more than in
fignificant fpotsin thevaft extent of France) there
it was that disquiet took pofleflion of every bo
som, and the interested cauf'e of theJ'e gowned
hypocrites was made the cause of the God of
peace and purify ! âlf the disturbances at Nitnes
and Montauban had not been extinguished at their
firft appearance, again should we have witnefled
those horrid scenes which dif'graced Prance in
the fifteenth century ; but thanks be to God, the
vigilance and zeal of some neighboring towns,
more enlightened by the benevolent philosophy of
the present age, and principally Bourdc-aux, had
the ability to prevent those cruel excefies. No
sooner where these tumults allayed than the Civil
Constitution of the Clergy afforded another pre
text for infurrecftion. The National Aflembly
having divided the Kingdom into departments,
to destroy, root and branch, those former di
visions called Provinces, had thought proper al
so to direcft a new division of Dioceses. I hey
had remarked that the Bifliops had always ex
ercised over the Clergy of the second older a de
gree of authority littie ffoort of defpotifin, and
which appertained neither to the ipirit of reli
gion nor the Constitution ; In consequence of
which they decreed that the Bifliops fliould ef
tablifli permanent and regular courts, but (hould
pais, no aifis of authority till the second order
had been admitted into a fliare of their deliber
ations. It was to no purpose that the Bilhops
ftrennuoufly opposed those innovations (as they
termed them) and complained of an invasion of
the spiritual jurifdidiiun and that the Aflembly
encroached upon the authority of the Church.
They were deaf to their complaints and remon
strances ; and referred them for an answer to
the authority of Charlemagne and the ancient
disciplineâUpon this the Episcopal Mandates
and Pastoral letters suddenly made their appear
ance again, (luffed with complaints more violent,
and refiecftions more bitter than ever ; but the
difcentented Clergy perceiving their letters dil
regarded and not answering the purpose intend
ed, fell upon other means of blowing up the
flames of discord. They flattered themselves
that a Proteflation, worded equivocally, and with
a plain title, and signed by some of the more ftt'ict
Clergy would have both a surer and readier ef
fect. And hence originated the famous Decla
ration, which at firft was only signed by those
refractory Bishops, who were deputed to the Na
tional Aflembly. This piece proposed a coalition,
and by that means gained some attention ; but
altho' it was publiflied throughout the Kingdom
to a degree of l'atiety, it made few converts, and
only received in general terms the approbation
of those whose opinions were already fixed 011
the fide of the BilhopsâSo much clamour, secret
machination, felf-interefted opposition, and the
apprehension of flill greater evils, have at length
determined the Aflembly to take efFet r tual men
fures humble the High Clergy. Kor this pur
pose they have decreed, that all Ecclefiaflics ant!
public officers of the Church should be compelled
to take an oath " to support not only the gene
ral government of the Kingdom, but also their
own particular constitution 011 penalty of being
deprived of theirplacesandlivings." 1 h:s seems
to be the last remedy in a desperate cafe, the on
ly probable means of accelerating and confoli
datino- the re-establishment of order in the King
dom.âHowever (to speak the truth) there is no
EXTREME REMEDY without danger ; and it is

Mr. Pitt said he had no objection that this pe

that there might be cases which would deserve

From the bey den Gazette, of February I.
Mr. Luzac, the Editor, after giving extracts
from the British papers on the fubjedb of the
WAR IN INDIA,
Inch as have been publiflied, adds, With ihefe
accounts, taken from English papers, it may be
Swe ll to compare tlie following extract of a letter,
dated Pondichery, July the 27th. The letter was
received by La Nyviphe, a French frigate ot war,
that left the IHe of France the 24th of last Sept.
and arrived at L'Orientthe 12th January.
" The army of Geiteral Meadows having be
gun its march the 10th or 12th of this month, as
if to proceed to CoinikoutoH*, for the purpose ot
attacking that of Tippo Sultan, commanded by the
Prince hiinfelf, the Madras Gazette of the 9th of
fuly, informed us, that on the 14th, a conlidera-
Lle firing was heard at a few leagues diltant Ca
rour, and that there was no doubt but that there
mud have been a brisk engagement between the
vanguards of the two armies. It was not before
the 27th that we were fully informed of the par
ticulars of this attack. Occnlar witnelles report
them to be as follow : The southern English ar
my having attempted to take a road, which led
to a defile, through which they intended to pass
in order to cross the mountains, without being
obliged to meet TipporSultan at Coimboutour,
and to pour in their forces into the extensive
plains of Seringapatnam, the capital of Mi foreâ
the Nabob met them with his feletft forces, chose
liis situation as an experienced general, and de
ceived the English by opposing them, to appear
ance, with a battery of 2 or 3 pieces of cannon
only : But in one night augmented it to IJ, and
raised two more of equal force, as wings to sup
port the firft ; but concealed them behind bushes.
lie also placed in ambuscade in the plain of Jou
ary, at the bottom of the defile, a considerable
body of cavalry, and of Caytoquiers. The British
on the 14th July, advanced to force themselves a
paflage ; but were surprised to find the refinance
jÂ»reat, and were obliged to fall back. General
Meadows then drew up his army in three columns,
and again advanced up to the batteries, which
he attempted to take by a (fault. The rolumn
which was directed to make up to the firft bat
tery, obliged to pass by the plains of Jouary,
to reach it : Two or three thousand hand-gre- j
nades here, cause much confufion in the column
arid the cavalry of Tippo at this instant came out
from their ambuscade, fell upon the column, at
tacked it vigorously, and prevented its rallying.
The two other columns were in the fame manner
driven back. Tippo-Sultan was posted behind
these batteries, with 12,ooochofen men, infantry,
and cavalry, and his army wjsd. awn up in order
of battle, at about a league from the place of
action. His son and Sayb-Saheb's commanded the
centre battery ; the other two were commanded
by Lally, andanother general of reputation. The
action, tho brisk, lasted 3or 4 hours. General
Meadows was obliged to fall back three leagues,
to encamp in a fafe place : He has loft in this at
tack his bravest troops. Provisions are fcaree in
liis army, and the price of then enormous. The
light cavalry of Tippo intercepts every thing
that attempts to pass between Trichenapala and
Carour. It is added, that Madras, which the
news of this action reached on tlie22d, is in great
consternation ; and that the loan of J lacs of pa
godas, which t lie English company is in great
want of, it is possible, may not succeed. This,
loan was opened at Madras, upon an interest of
10 per cent, the principal to be redeemed in two

It is well known that the National Aflembly
had very sanguine expectations of relief to the
Finances from the patriotic gift and the volun
tary contribution of the fourth ofevery citizen's
income: Indeed, it was publicly alferted that
the contribution of Paris alone would amount to
30,000,000 of livres, about 1,250,000!. llerling.
How were these expectations answered ? It ap
pears by the last accouut Mr. Neckar presented
to the National Aflembly, 31ft July, 1790, that
the receipts of the patriotic gift amounted to 110
more than 361,000 livres, and of the voluntary
contribution 9,721,000 livres : so that the patri
otifin of all France, urged by all its ofators,
to fubfci ibe in support of its new born liberty,
produced about 420,000!. Englilh money, a sum
considerably less than our annual malt tax:

PARIS, February 17,
The two extremities of France, Britanny and"'
Alsace, are in a 1110 ft convulsed liate, and boiU
for the fame reasonâin the former province,' well
known for the bravery of its inhabitants and their
little knowledge of the French dialeift, the peo
ple consider religion as injured, as annihilated
by the laws enacted on the civil constitution of
the clergy ; they think that their children wilt
not be baptised, and that the patient, ftruggli n >r
against the afiault of death, will be deprived of
the spiritual comfort he would at a former period
have foliciied and obtained from ihe Minister of
the Altar. "We will, fay they, keep onr good
Bifliop among us, and he (hall continue in his pa
lace at Vannes ; we will have our Redtors and
our Chapter, onr Clergy (hall be honorably us e d .
we will pay them their tythes ; we regre: the
suppression of the monasteries, and we deem wor
thy of public indignation all such as buy what is
misnamed national property." Thus was the
matter laid before the AU'embly on the 14th, and
it gavp rife tothe following decree : " The King
is prayed immediately to fend into that province
troops, to quell the disturbances that diflradt it
and commifiioners to calm the people's fury;"
and the Aflembly enacfts, " that the Bilhops of
Morbihaun, of Leon, and of Vannes, do attend
the House." It is imagined here, by both par
ties, that the Bishops will not be allowed to come
up to Paris, and that the foldierswill ineet with
a warm reception from the hot-headed Bretons.

their fathers as and feeni inclined to
risk their all tooppofe those whom they consider
as the tyrants of their conlcience. On the 9th

enation of the domain of Fenetanges in favor of

HARTFOKD, Apt il 18,
A Correspondent observes, by a paragraph from an European
oaprr, that the National Assembly of France, in forming a judi
ciary system for that kingdom, contemplate the eftablifhirient of
juries, but are at a loss to know what the Englilh mean by calling
a trial by jury a trial by a man's petrs ; and it has been much deba
ted whether any property, and how much should be made a re
quisite to constitute a legal juroT. There is no doubt but any man
would be puzzled to find how jury trial in England is a trial by
nery man's equals \ as civil suits of all kinds, whether between
two noblemen or two tenant# are tried by a common jury.
It is fufpefted that the English idea of the origin of juries is
wrong, and it has remained for one of our own countrymen to
detest the mistake. Mr. Webster, in his ElTays and Fugitive
â writings, has made it probablo that the word peer did not come
from a word, denoting equality, but had a very different origin.
If his derivation is the true one, it throws new light on the ln
dilution of juries, as well as on other parts ot the Englilh conlli-
tutton,

FROM THE (MaIT.) HAMPSHIRE CHRONICLE.
MR. PRINTER,
I AST Saturday night I went with several gentlemen, who view
ed and measured the rock from which Lt. Joseph Shaw fell,
an was remarkably preserved from a sudden death : And as I
oubt not but you will give it a place in your paper for your
readers I beg leave to fend you an account of it for publication.
On the morning of the 19th Feb. last, Mr. Shaw had taken a
and on the top of a very high mountain, for the purpose of
way-laying a fox which he expe&ed, as the hounds were then
in the woods, and at no great distance. He had not waited long
f Â°re the fox came in view on a cragg of the rock some distance
e Â°w him ; he fired, and the fox dropped from the rock on
TKf fell dire&ly out of fight down the mountain.
e f 'Â°w was exceedingly hard and smooth, occasioned by a
Â«on iderable rain which had fallen a few days before, and after-
Vva r s froze very hard. A considerable quantity of water had
e m way from cinder the snow, a few feet from the verge of
â¢c preje 1 pice, and there frozen to a smooth, solid ice, which ad-
j c t0 *he hideoufnefs of the place ; a light snow which was then
a ,n g, made it impoflible to distinguish between the encrusted
now anc * ice : Thus ciicumftanced Mr. Shaw ventured to the
Â°f the ledge to fee what had become of his fox ; when
ad got within a few feet of the summit of the rock, he fteppefi
the icc, and his feet flipping up, he fell instantaneously
Â°*n the precipice.
wher 'h* dr3wn rom *ke pl ac c where he flipped off the rock, to
t Cr f e struck, which was on another rock, measures fitiy-
and an half; he then fell fifty-feven feet and an halffur-
j fel C }*l re ' ,e struck again, and from thence he slid twenty-five
ot (J ' even inches, to the verge of another ledge, or benching
hold e f rnouma,n , where he providentially flopped, by catching
he it Â° A P' nc bush not larger than a man's finger. When
Â°ppcd,he lay wiih his head so far over the rock that he cou -a
look down the ledge, wheretf he had fallen again, he mull have
dcfcended seventy or eighty feet further, and probably have been
dalhed in pieces. As foori as he was able he callcd for help, and
two young men who were hunting, and *vere at the foot of
the mount ain, thr> they exerted themselves to the utmost of their
power for his dflillance, could not by any means get within feve
â¢ral hundred feet of him. Alter some lime had elapsed, his bro
iher, Mr. James Shaw, hearing him calling for help, tho at a
d (lance ol near a mile, came to his affitlance ; after two hours
incredible toil, he at length got within five and twenty or thirty
febt of him, and found it irapoflible to proceed any nigher.
Mr. Shaw, finding no way to be aflifted, found it necelfary to
extricate himfclf from his deplorable situation ; he therefore, not
without great danger, found means to get into his hand a dry small
ltick, the end of which he sharpened with his knife, and then by
cutting holes into the snow and ice, drew himfelf on his belly to
his brother.
One thing I had like to have forgotten to mention ; when Mr.
Shaw had lain in the situation I have described. near half an hour,
and was endeavoring to fhift himfelf into an easier pofturc, he
found his fox dead, and lying under him, which he threw down
to the men who wrere waiting lor them at the foot of the ledge.
Tho the two brothers were now together, they found it very dif
ficult to get off the mountain, which however they effected in
about four houts ; and notwithstanding Mr. Shaw had fallen so
far, an d was \ery much bruised, yet he walked home to his own
houff, nnd is now nearly recovered.
The above circumjlances are well authenticated.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES,
SOFT o'er my foul the voice of music breathes,
Waking the sympathies which thrill delight.
The Mental Spirit hails seraphic light;
Heavenly Visions fill the fight.
Glory bangs immortal wreaths;
Joy the Harp divine unfheaths ;
Echo answering as it rings,
Female Virtue strikes the strings.
Nearly allied the trembling Pa/Jions live :
And all the Emotions of the human mind,
In mystic bands united, fondly give
Mingling responses, tremulously join'd.
Now tranquil Pleafurc foftly moves along.
Touching the cord to which mild Melancholy's voice,
In answers low, awakes the figh-cxciting song,
Making sweet Pity's tear-fuffufed eyes rejoice,
As now, in awful tho't fubltme,
She fees the immortal Spirit triumph over Time.
O Thou whofc foul, rcfponfive, wakes the lyre!
Throw off, of gorgeous praise, the rich attire,
And. with united labours, let us toil,
To raise the mind to energy of tho't;
To bid Morality attractive frnile;
And deep impress what Heaven itfelf hath taught.
O let us strive, with union'd hearts sincere ;
To form the patriot foul to deed severe;
To draw the sympathetic tear ;
To bid of love the generous transports glow;
The ennobling warmth of friendfhip flow ;
And kind companion's hand.
In extacy expand,
To soothe Misfortune's woe.
O let us wake the Imaginative Powers
Wbofe smiles give pleasure to the pafling hours ;
Whose kind progreflion weans the heait
From earth, and all its low concerns,
And bids it, anxious, wish that better part,
That borne, for which the immortal Spirit yearns ;
Which draws it, sweetly, from this fad abode,
To Heaven, to Happinef, to GOD.

And Human Bltfs, breathes o'er the echoing lyre.

European accounts, received in various direc

measures adopted by the government of the Uni

promoting prosperity at home, as well as to sup
port their chara<fter and relpecftability abroad,
more particularly in regard to its public credit
and financesâand no law that has been enadled,
is more likely to conciliate the refpecft of Fo
reigners than that for the establishment of the

Law are contained hi the Report of the Secre

A letter from London, to the Editor of the Ge

AH'embly have equipped two vellels to go in quest
of M. de la Peyroufe.
When I left Madrid a trial for a libel was pro
secuting against 4 Italians and 3 Spaniards, all
men of familyâthey were accused of writing a

Not Florida Blanca, heis minister of Stateâand
a man who defei ves to be, and is beloved.
It was talked of at Madrid, that Mr. Cabarrus
would be set at libertyâThis worthy gentleman
was accused of causing to be bought at Paris, to
the amount of eight millions in the French funds,
and the King had been made to believe there
would be a lofa of twenty-five per cent. But
since a private bancker of Madrid has contracted
for the purchase of those funds the disagreeable
impreflion on the character of Mr. Cabarrus, is
done away.
In Italy every thing is quietâin Spain it is a
crime to (peak of the French revolutionâltaly is
still too fond of the fine arts, to allow them time
to turn their attention to politics. For my part,
I wifli that every nation may enjoy that liberty,
the sweets of which you Americans have so well

Two years have elapsed since the firft number of this Gazette
was published : In retracing the period, what a series of events
croud on the mind ! pieafing, important, and intercfting to man
kind in general, and peculiarly so to the citizens of these free
States. The transforming influence of that Conflitution, which,
without fraud, force or surprise, a wife and magnanimous people
have adopted, is most strikingly exemplified, in that peace, secu
rity, and respe&ablity, which this Union now enjoys :âLong
may they continue ; and under the'r benign afpe&s, may the
foundations of civil liberty be laid so broad and deep, as to resist
the changes of human weakness, and the ravages of time. It has
been the supreme ambition of the Editor to disseminate senti
ments favorable to the produ&ion of these events ; if he has, in
any degree, contributed to r.heii existence, his labors will be re
warded, at lead with pieafing refle&ions.
The present poftureof affairs in this Union, is as novel as it is
pleasing : Envy, faction, and party, are drftitute of a fubjettâand
except the pride o f prophecy fliould be piqued at finding its anti
cipations totally illusory, our country mud progress in freedom
and happiness.
The United States may therefore be felicitated on its situation
and profpe&s ; a glorious spirit of emulation pervades the several
governments, and to excel 111 arts, manufa&ures, agriculture, and
commercial enterprise, appears to be the general object.
A series of speculations in the newspepers, on the mod ufeful

SXPENCE AND PROMT OF RAISING SILK-WORMS
ONE hundred trees of two or three

and improve the ground in which they
grow. Any vegetable or grass will
thrive well under them : indeed by
keeping the ground loose about their

The worms thrive best in mere flieds
almost. A tight room is not the thing.
A hut, any kind of rough and flight shel

corner of a barn enclosed for the pur

lieceflary to run up a small building for

Suppose our farmer has a wife and two chil

ot hatching his eggs (they will cost him nothing)
and by rhe middle of August the work is done.â
In that time his wife children and himfelf, not
employed all the day long about the silk-worms,
may raise at lead 160,000 of them.
Then the only thing is to reelofFthis silk. To
be sure if will require time, patience and indus
try to reel off 1,900,00 c yards of silk which these
160,000 worms have made ; but no money is re
quired to doit. The wife and children doit at their
