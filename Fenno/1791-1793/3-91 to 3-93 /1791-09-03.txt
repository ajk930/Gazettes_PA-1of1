FROM THE NEW-YORK JOURNAL, &c.
To the Gentlemen ej the GrarJ Jury of the County nf ABBEVILLE in
Ike State of Sou th-Caro l i n a.
A PRESENTMENT from your body tÂ» one of the judical courts
of your State, has been published in several Gazettes in the
United States. As it applies solely to a national law, it is a pro
per object of decent com ment for any of your fellow citizens ;
and it cannot be doubted that you will be ready to hear any thing,
which can prove you are honestly mifhkcn in a matter which ts
deemed of so much importance to liberty, and which is also of
conlequence to the cridit of our common country abroad, and a;
home.
You fay the cxcife ast is a grievance of the highest nature. This
is (Irong language, brethren, and llronger, it is believed, than you
will find the faÂ£ls to support. If this law had been pafled with
out competent powers in Congress, aud to carry on an ambitious war,
it would surely have been a grievance of a higher nature. This is
no play on words, for grand juries are sober and important bodies
of men, have the mod serious duties to performâ(hould " enquire
diligently, and make true presentment." They (hould not mis
name man-daughter and call it muider, nor (hould they call b)
either of those criminal names, the lawful aflions of an individual,
much less of a government, though those actions should unhappily
end in death. It is never well in discharge of public duties to let
expressions go forth, which, by irritating, may produce lament
able evils. The more freedom is used with you, brethren, on
this point, because it is supposed the language of freedom will not
be oitenfive to you, and because you have (hewn all necessary mo
deration and reason in the conclusion of your presentment, by re
commendinga conftiiutional and lawfulapplication, through your
fenatois and representatives, for an alteration of the law.
You fay also, that all excifcs arc incompatible with liberty,
which history, you observe, will fully (hew. This is certainly a
miflake, lor the history of every nation that ever contra&ed debts,
and formed a fyftein to discharge those di bis (hews that they have
uniformly had recourse to them. The American provinces had
excises laid by their own legidatures, the popular branches of
which were freely chosen by the peopleâyet nobody ever thought,
or said, the provincial legidatures enslaved their conllituents. On
the contrary, it is well known they were conltantly engaged 111
druggies, against the crown, in favor of the people. The State of
Pennsylvania, which had only one popular house, for many years,
and no negative in the execuiive, had an excise through half this
centuryâThe amount of it being eight pence, their money, per
gallon, was as near as poflible to nine cents, which is the rate of
country fpirils, per gallon, under the aÂ£l of Congress, unless the
diftill: r, living in the country, chufes to pay sixty cents per an
num, for each gallon his (I'll holds, for the right of (tilling as
much as he can through a year -Then the duly will be lower, if
there is any industry in working the Hill. Massachusetts, a free
State, with a well conllituted government, had an excifeâCon
nefheut, with a legislature chofrn half yearly, had an excise ; and
Co of other American States. Britain and Holland, two of the
freeft countries in Europe, had an excise ; and Fiance, now freer
than cither of them, or any other country in Europe, has anexcile.
All taxes (including excise) are equally compatible with liberty, if
the legijlature iifreely and frequently chosen. How can the cxcife of
Congress be incompatible with liberty, if the people veiled them
with power to lay it, and can turn out every Congress man that
voted for it, if they really think it bell, and chufe others instead
of them. Freedom can never be endangered by a law, the repeal
of which, a bate majority can any moment effect.
You suppose the dwelling houfesoi the people liable to be entered
at all times, night orday, by ihe oiticers. In this, brethren, you
are mistaken ; and it is a very great millake, for the officers are
not authorised to go into the dwelling houses, in ihe night or day
either. They can go into liquor (lores, liquor cellars, and liquor
vaults, and distilleries marked as such, but that only in the day
trmc. So tender is the law, that though it (hall be made to appeal,
on oath to a judge or justice of the peace, that spirits are fraudu
lently hid in a dwelling house, to deprive the country of the duty,
the officer cannot go into even that house without a warrant under
the hand and seal of a judge or justice, nor without a conft,.ble or
peace officer with him, nor can he go at any time, but only by
day. 1 1
It IS said, again, by you, brethren, that the dnty will not bear
theexpenceof coining in some places. This, also, mult be a
nunake, for a land tax, or poll tax, in a thin fettled country, must
be more cxpenfive and troublesome. Ailments, Uvics, dis
traints, advf rtifementss, and sales ot property for those taxes, are
much more inconvenient.
It fcems probable, that you were mifinformed about many
parts of the law, especially the manner in which the duty is laid
on country stills. Jomc have thought the duty to be sixty cents
for every gallon that the still (hould make ; bui this is a great error.
No more is laid than sixty cents tor a whole year upon thequantity
that would fill t he still once, and if enough fpiiitslhould notbemade
to amount to that at nine ccnts per gallon, the owner may have
it deducted, by taking care to keep an account of what he makes
in the manner the law dircdls. More than nine cents on what is
made will, therefore, never be paid by those who take proper
care of their own business ; but less will be paid by all those who
arc so induftiious as to make more spirits than sixty cents, on the
measure or capacity ot the still. will come to. This will have an
effect very favorable to the planters and farmers, because industri
ous men, who will make a trade of distilling, will set up work-,
ant! making considerable profiti by this, and by distilling largely,'
will be able to buy larger parcels of grain at better prices, to
manufacture into spirits.
You complain, that the northern distillers will have the ad
vantage, but you will think otherwise when you have examined
this point. Spirits from molafles pays two cents per gallon more
than that from grairror fruit, which is above twenty-two percent,
or twenty-two pounds in the hundied. This is too clear and
plain to dwell upon. It would be to queftian your candor or
understanding to do more than mention the tact.
'Â»u appear to labor under the fame want of information, when
you complain about theexcife being too high in proportion to the
jmpoft Â«)i) foreig/t spirits. The loweit proof of foreign rum,
randy, See. is at twenty cents ; the lowest proof of country grain
or fru't spirits is at nine cents. The difference is prodigioufiy in
hÂ°f 1,0 homc anf * ' s Plainly better for him to have
1 e ftnall du y on country m.-de spirits, feeing it is accompanied
with one so much greater on rival foreign spirits.
It is but right to remember how much the States are made free
â¢ Â« he occafiori to lay taxes by the aflumption, which part of the
P u ',c a "d the defence of the western country, this duty is
appropriated to. If South-Carolina is averfc to the excise, she
Saturday, September 5, 1791.
ought not to avail herfelf of the opportunity of getting four mil
lions of her debt on the United States. The ineafure comes re
markably easy to your State, because little foreign rum is used on
the sea coast countie , on account of the small number of whites,
and great number of blacks : and in the western country the
h' ne made spirits are to pay only nine cents, which is less than
half the duty.
I am, gentlemen,
Your friend and humble servant,
A New-York Grand Jury Man.

Mr. Trumbuli.,
In a late paper of your's, there appeared a para

ledging their fidelity and fubmitiion to the new
conlliiution.
June if. The following articles have been
added to the New Coiittitution, and have receiv
ed the unanimous fantfion ofthe Diet of Poland.
Of the King, the Executive Power.
" No Government, though it were the mod
perfect that can be imagined, can subsist unless
the executive power be enabled to act with the
fulled energy.
[Would to Heaven that this principle, which
is incontrovertibly just and true, were every
where admitted ! Owing to the non-obfervaiice
of this indif'penfible axiom, the revival of liber
ty has become odious to all those who have Hill
a regard for social order.]
" Jult and equitable laws are the foundation
of national happiness.
All the good effects to be expected from
them, mutt depend on their having been vigor
ously executed.
" Experience has taught us, that to a want of
this executive energy, Poland owes all its mis
fortunes.
" For these reasons, after having insured li
berty to the Polish nation, and having made it
independent ; after having secured to it the
right of making laws, and of watching over the
executive authority, and also of chooling all pub
lic magistrates ; we entrull the King and his
Council (which shall hereafter be Ailed the Su
pei intending Council) with the Supreme execu
tion of the laws.
'[ executive power fliall be under a ftritft
obligation to superintend the execution of the
laws, and exemplarily to ,conform to them, k
(hall at't in all cases permitted by the law ; in all
such cases which require a fuperintendance, exe
cution, and even a coercive force. All Mapif
trates are bound to obey it implicitly ; and by it
they are liable to bepunifhed for neglect of duty
or disobedience.
" The executive power fliall neither make
laws, nor explain them. It (hall not impose tax
es, or levy contributions. It fliall not contract
public debts, nor make the lealt alteration in
the collection of the revenue. And finally, i c
fliall neither declare war nor make peace ; not
make any treaties with other powers. It fliall
only be enabled to have a temporary correspon
dence with foreign courts, so far as the fafery
and tranquily of the ftatc may require ; and for
this ir fliall be accountable to the following Le
gfflature." Â°
ROME, June 3.
The chagrin experienced by his Holiness, oc
casioned by the revolt of Avignon and the de
crees of the National AHembly of France relative
to the Clergy, is a little alleviated by learning
the progress of the Roman Catholic religion in
some of the provinces of North-America, and
chiefly in Acadia, Maryland, and part of Penn
sylvania. Charles Walmefly, Bifliop of Rama
has consecrated Mr. John Carroll, superior of the
foreign milfions, in quality of Bifliop of Balti
more, the Congress of Philadelphia having per
mitted the free exercise of the Roman Catholic
i eligion in the aforefaid provinces.

The accounts from the empire are confirmed.
The Count d'Artois has been at Ulm, but is re
turned to Augfbourg. M. de Calonnc does not
mean to go there, for which reason the Prince
de Lambefc, and other emigrants of the old
French nobility, have quitted Manheim and Deux
Pouts, where they had aflfembled to wait the re
lult of the attempt on Huninguen, which itfeenis
has not answered their expetfation.

LONDON, June 30
The Marquis de Bouille has not been appre
hended. It is said, that he escaped by changing
his uniform with a private dragoon ; and that
this man being taken for the Marquis gave rife
to the report of his apprehension.
M. Calonne is said to have taken abroad with
him a Sw'ifs gentleman, whom he had leletled
out for very 1 are ability.âThis gentleman had
the address to reach the French Kingâto carry
on and plan all that scheme, which, so unfortu
nately for the King, has been defeatedâlie ar
ranged everv means for hisefcapeâprocured the
relay of horses, along the road, and concerted
every step neceflary for the escape of the Royal
Family.
That gentleman is now fafe !
He made a noble effort to rescue the Kingâ
whose person made it (till more dilficult to faye
him.
Fortune has defeated that event !â It will re
main with a generous people not to make an ill is
sue of what accident lias put into their power.
Greatness of mind never appealed to such ad
vantage, or flione with more brilliancy, in the
Royal House of Brurifvvick, than in the conduct
of our present foveteign towards the Duchess of
Albany. When we reflect on the misfortunes of
that unhappy family, and with what an eye of
enmity they have been beheld here, the recepti
on of the Duchess at this Court proves that his
Majesty is poflefled of every milder virtue.
Under our present form of government, this
country has arrived to a (late of wealth, power
and national happiness, that no other kingdom
or (late upon the face of the earth enjoys iii the
fame degree of perfection. Ought not the man
or men, therefore, who wilh to alter that system
of government, he gibbeted in the most conspi
cuous manner, as a common enemy and traitor
to the Constitution ?
At no time fi-.ice the discovery of America,lias
a trade of equal extent been carried 011 between
this country and that continent, as exills at this
moment, and which trade, fortunately for En
gland, is every day rapidly increasing.
It is greatly to the credit of adniiniftration,
that they are endeavouring by every prudent
means toincveafe the trade of Amei ica, and to
render them and us united as it is our mutual in
terest to be. The corn art of the last session will
be extremely gratifying to the Americans, and
â will mod certainly be considered by them as a
favor from this country.
Mr. Minchin's promised bill for the encourage
ment of the culture of hemp, which will be
brought forward early in the next feflion, will
likewise be advantageous to America, as we are
given to underftnnd thar it is the intention of
the promoters of that bill to introduce a clanfe
for allowing a bounty on the importation of hemp,
the growth of America.
The orders from America for woolen ponds
have much inereafed ; the quantity about to be
exported from Leeds, and its neighbourhood on
ly, amounts to nearly 600,0001.
There can be no doubt of the poflibility of ren
dering America as serviceable to this country, in
146
the production of raw materials, asthemoft ft te
nuous advocates against a Ruffian War contend
that Russia is ; and it is prefumcd that every
Entrlifhman, from the funilarity ot manners the
fame language, and the fame habits with his bre
thren of America, would prefer a trade wit 1
them to any other people under tlie fun. No
thing is more certain than that the Americans
prefer a connexion with England to any o> .iet
nation, and that they are daily becoming mote
attached to this country than they ever wet e.

From Jersey we learn, that the inhabitants have

The fire which broke out during the night of
the of May, at Brefl.iu,appears to have been
more deftruftive than from the fir It accounts it
was imagined. Seventy honfes, two bridges,
h.ee churches, a convent, and several mills tull
of corn, fell a facrifice to the flames.
M. de Calonne has drawn a very large portion
of his fortune from'this country in aid of the
counter-revolution in France. The Polignacs,
ind some other rich dillinguifhed persons, who
are likewise of the Royal Party, have also con
tributed very largely.
CAPTAIN GROSE
The literary quacks of the day elbow them
selves so much into public notice, that they
scarcely leave a niche for real genius ; hence we
hardly hear a word to the memory of the late
Captain Grofe, except the paragraph of his death,
and the advertifenient for the sale of his books
and drawings.
i he late F. Grofe was lefc a very independent
fortune by his father, at an early age ; but like
many men of a sprightly turn and good parrs,
lie did not reckon right for the evening of life
fie engrafted carelefsuefs on a love of pleasure,
and what was (till vvorfe, mixed the former in
his business ; insomuch that when he was Adju
tant and Paymaster in the Surrey Militia, his
only two books of accounts (as he used pleasant
ly to tell) were his right and left hand pockets
âIn the one he received, and from the other
paid, and'this too with a want of circumfpecfti
on which may be readily supposed from such a
mode of book-keeping.
His lotTes, however, on this occasion, roused
his latent talents. With a good claftical educa-
ion, he united a fine taste for drawing, and en
couraged by his friends, as well as prompted by
his situation, he undertook a work that will long
remain a monument of his geniusâ" The anti-
quities of England and Wales " âThis was fol
lowed by " The antiqnities of Scotland " A
Treatise on antient armour & weapons of war
â" Gambado on Horfemanftiip â" Military
antiquities and History of the English Army
â A number of private viewsâhumorous books,
prints, sketches, &c. &c. His last work, which
is unfinifhed, is "On the antiquities of Ireland;"
âTo which place he went in the course of last
winter, and where he died suddenly at the table
of a friend in the 54th year of his age.
This is a sketch of the literary hillory of the
late F. Grofe, Esq. which, as it is,
was exceeded by his good humour, conviviality,
and friendlhip. Living much abroad, and in
the best company at home, such as the Earl of
Bute, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir JoftiuaÃeynolds.and
the feleifl members of the literary societies, lie
had the easiest habits of adapting himfelf to all
tempers and, being a man of general know
ledge, he always drew out some conversation
that was either nfeful to himfelf, or agreeable to
the party ; he could observe upon most things
with precision and judgment, but his natural
tendency was to humour, in which lie excelled,
both by the feletftion of anecdotes, and his man
ner of telling them, it may be said, too. that his
figure rather ailifted him, which was in faift the
very title page of a joke.
He had neither the pride nor malignity of au
thorshipâ he felt the independency of his own
talents, and was fatisfied with them, without de
grading others. His friendfhips were of the fame
cast, con (fan t and sincere, overlooking little faults
and reeking our greater virtues. In fiiorr, he
had a good heart, and, abating those little indis
cretions natural to most men, could do no \vron<*.
The address of the National AlTeaibly to t'â e
people of France, in reply to the king'? prodT

enlighiened representatives of the French, a i U
tio:i united among tliemfelves, and breathing a
spirit of liberty, and internal union and harnio

oils of despotism, and even defy tile worlj

A prosecution was lately commenced in the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland,
against a Dr. M'Gill, for heresy ; but the A lie in

difference between the present and former times.
A society of gentlemen, of whom Mr. Thorn
ton, Mr. Sharpe, and other friends to the aboli
tion of the Slave Trade, are the principals, have
undertaken an emerprize of lingular benevo
lence. The difappointmenr in the loss of the
question on the Slave Bill has excited them to
pursue the fame object by different, and it is hop
ed more fuccefsful means. They are about to
form a settlement 011 the native coast of the ne
groes in Africa, for the purpose of exhibitingthe
advantages of cultivating their own foil, inltead
of employing their lives in making each other
(laves to foreigners. From what we can colled
of the plan, it is proposed to invite, by the moll
kind and generous offei s, the natives of the coun
try to fend their children to this new feulemenf,
to be educated in religious principles, and to
learn the different methods used in the planting
of cotton, coffee, rice, and such vegetables as suit
the foil and climate, and to initiate therifingge-
lieration to such habits ot life as may give thein
some elevaiion in the fcaleof rational exiltence.
We remember that this idea, which is one of
those extraordinary stretches of lininanity that
diltingiiifh the present age, was darted many
years ago by the venerable Dean of Gloucelter,
as the only effectual means to be employed for
the removal of that grievance, the Slave Trade.

Our modern physicians have so many infalli
ble cures that it is wonderful any one ihould he
afflidted with any disorderâand yet the Bills of
Mortality continue much the fame, or rather up
on the encreafe. How can these things be ac
counted for ? Many of them aflert, that they can
cure the gout ; âlet the afflicted beware of phy
sicians, for we read in the fir it book of Kings, that
Asa was the firit man who had the gout, and we
read also, the consequence of his resorting to me
dical assistance. " Now, Asa, the King was Hif
eafed in his feet, and he applied to the Physici
ans instead of applying to the Lord, therefore
the Lord flew him."

Agreeable to an act of the last Allembly, the
surveyor general departed from hence last Friday
t;> explore the communications between theHud
fou lliver and Wood creek, falling into lake
Champlain, for the purpose of ascertaining the
mo ft eligible place to lay off the ground for the
proposed canal, to open a water communication
with Vermont, and thereby divert the produce
from Canada to our navigable waters.
We are further informed that Major Ilarden

the bead of Mohawk river and Wood creek,
falling into the Oneida lake, b rom ihefe ap

SPRINGFIELD, Angnfl 24.
HaM.y, Augufl ii, 1 791
On Friday evening lalt, as Mr. Ebenezer Bolt
wood, Mr. Gideon Parsons, and Mr. Merril, were
going from Hadley to Amherft, in a covered wag
gon, they miffed their way, and instead of driv
ing to Aniherft, they turned to the left hand at
the North end of Hadley, at a place called High
Banks, and drove direcftly down the bank : âIt
being measured the next morning, it appears the
horses and waggon descended 40 feet before they
{truck, and then threw the inen 8 or 10 feet fur
ther before they landed, without material injury
to men, horses or waggon. Something peculiar
must attend old bachelors, or Mr. B. inuft have
been killed.

the House of Reprefentativeg, confuting of Mr.
Clyster, Mr. Finley, and 'Mr. Gallatin, to bring

uâ¢ a]tli tlie fif-ft article of amendment, propot'ed
by Cor.grels to the Constitution of the United

Same clay an aiifwer to the Governor's speech
was rn efented by a committee of the hbufe;âln
which they recognize the great attention paid by
the firft niagiftrate to the public interest during
the recessâand mod heartily concur with him,
" in declaring that the prosperous iituation of
this slate, connedted with the credit of.the Union,
happily provides the means, and affords the, op
portunity, not only for the improvement of Penn
sylvania in her natural advantages, but in her
arts, commerce and agriculture."
The merchandize imported into Peterfburgli,
RulTia, the last year, amounted to 22,964,619 rou
blesâand the duties paid on merchandize im
ported at Revel, amounted to 1,500,000 roubles ;
in the year 1789, they only amounted to 200,000
roubles.
Some late accounts in . the English papers re
port, that insurrections have taken place among
the people in several parts of Spain.
The accounts from various places on the conti
nent, where the refugees from France are fup
pofcd to reside, contain no pofiiive relation of
such movements among the anti-revolutionists at
the time of the King's flight, which ftiould lead
to a supposition, that any plan to invade the king
dom was digested or ripe for execution.âThe
officers of several regiments, ic is said, have left
the kingdom ; but it appears to have been in
confeqiience of a belief that the King had ef
fected his el'cape. Should the belligerent pow
ers conclude a general peace, some of the neigh
N Y, August 22
bonring states may possibly interfere in the af
iVus of Franceâbut, even in that cafe, their at
tempts will depend on a concurrence of circum-
Ihmces, of which present appearances do not war
rant a:i expectation; among iliefc are, a certain
ty of their own dominions being feeure from in
fnrreclions, and thar fucli a p oportion of ihe ci
tizens of France will unite with thein, as to ren
der an iuvafi jn p atfticable, and in a high degree
likely to lucceed.â But should the French in the
mean time complete the fabric of freedom and
good government, they may defy the united
powers of despotism in their attempts to effedt a
counter-revolution.
Arrived at Bermuda-Hundred, brig Petite, Na
netre, Pittalugne, Havre-de-Grace, with Jl pas

of a Mr. Smith, now in France.
Barns, it has been observed, are more fre
quently (truck with lightning than other build
ings May it not be owing to the rat ified (late of
the air within, occasioned by the heat generated
by grain and hay put in and closely confined, be
fore they are perfetfly dry. If this is the fad:,
would it not be belt to keep the doors and win
dows of barns constantly open till the above arti
cles are entirely diverted of moisture, that the
density of the circumambient air may not be
greater than that within ?âAnd on the principle
that r.irified air has a tendency to attraift the elec
tric fluid j fliould not the doots and windows of
houses be kept open in athutiderfhower, in order
to keep up ail equilibrium of air in the house
with the air without."
A letter of a late date from England;,'fo a gentleman in this city
contains the following observation " But it comforts me to con
clude that the boftilities upon the eminent will giv# the French
an opportunity of eftabliftiing their government, and of making
their kingdom an afvlum sot those opprefled fubjetts, whose age
or poverty will not admit of their fetking relief at three thousand
miles distance."
Arrived lately at Boston, the schooner Cohaffet, Plummer,
from Oporto. During the homeward bound passage, one of the
crew of the above schooner broke out with the small-pox, on
which Captain Plummer instantly innoculated hiinfelf and the
whole crew, ho all recovered.
Governor Mifflin's speech recognizes two circumstances in the
situation of our country, which will doubth fs inspire every good
citizen with sentiments corresponding with those expressed by the
patriotic firft magistrate of so refpe&able a member of the Unionâ
allusions to the flmrifhing state of our country from so high an au
thority, will have a proportional influence on the public mind ;
they are of more weight than the anonymous effufions of piivate
individuals however sincere and fervent ; and infinitely more
than counterbalance the evanescent ebullitions of little sneering
paitv mindsâThe Governor fays,
" I am happy in addrefling you at this period, while the beneficial
efFeÃs ofthe eftablifliment of the public credit of the United States
yield a conclusive evidence of our national prosperity â
and leisure afforded from our private avocations, by an early and
abundant HA RVEST, will enable you to renew vour public
labors with the fame zeal and alacrity which distinguish the legis
lative proceedings of yo ur l feflion."
In times of anarchy and confufion, the bonds of focicty being
either relaxed or broken, confidence in public and private jufticc
is destroyedâthe circulating property of men of business and
wealth, gtadually recedes, and becomes dormant; the precious
metals are transported into other countries, or retire to secret cof
fers, and rust in their retreatâevery enterprize is foreborne, and
universal distress enfnes. In this situation of things the people are
very apt to mistake the cause of their diftrefles, and in consequence
have r<couifc to a variety of ill adapted expedients to retrieve
their affairs.
To rcftore mutual confidence, and give life and aÂ£t vity to agri
culture, arts and commerce, the only adequate means is good go
vernment ; which being firmly eftabliftied, and just and compe
tent laws ena6ted and executed, produce 1 renovation in the ass irs
of every country. How forcibly is this sentiment imprefLd ou
the mind by the experience ofthe United Statesâfrom a full con
fidence ill the permanency of those fyftenis which the united wis
dom of our country has adopted, the men of property arc now
coming forward with their capitals to eflablifh manufactures on a
broad and extensive scaleâwhich for wait of union in our coun
cils, and the incompetency of individnal means, have languiftied
under every discouragement, or proved ruinous to every periou
who has had temerity enough to engage in them.
There is a great degree of perverfenefs in some dispositions ;
to find fault appears their natural habitâand it is in vain to expeÂ£t
any thing like good nature, or a generous acknowledgment of
merit from thi m. Men of property, who by a patriotic confi
dence in the fuccefsof the American cause, have encreafed their
foitunes, have been branded with the basest epithetsâ-and now
that some are devising plans for the advantage of the countiy, in
the establishment and extention of manufactures, they are charged
with designs hostile to the real interell of the peopleâSuch con
duct need* no comment.
Some opposition, it is said, appears againll the excise in the
weftein countryâbut if this is fact, we doubt not on a little re
flexion it will disappearâwhen it is confidired that the froniiers
arc generally fettled by persons, who from previously living in the
more populous parts of the country, fee and realize the impor
tance of paying for the protection of government and the sup
port of just la ws, we may expect the most cordial acquicfcence
will soon take place; especially when they rcfltdt on the iinmcnfe
expences actually incurred by the United States for their prt sent
defen e, and the great sums in solid coin sent into the midftof
them so pay the army march ng from 6 to 700 miles for their
protection. Some persons are so illiberal as to fay that an exemp
tion from all taxation is one great ohieft to perfnns who emigrate
to the frontiers ; if this is the cafe, it is not this, that or the other
tax that would suitâevery public imposition to raise a revenue
for any purpose whatever being equally odious.
The PROMPTER, corrrftcd, and with additional Numbers,
is shortly to be re-publifhcd in an O&avo Volume.
