AS pflblic?Mnpinefs : includes the g-eneral welfare of ihe p p o-
of)lcrvatujns will rcfpeft equally national and indi
vidual profperTiy. We will fiift conlider ihe facts and circum
stances, which nnKv exist favorable to hapoinefs in the United
Slat's of America. The territory is as gteat as the w;fhesof man,
it is diverfified with all the varietv ot foils and climates ncceffary
for every production ; it is accommodated with the fincft riveis
and .harbors, in ihe known wotld, with every other circomftance
conducive to and commereeâv.t. Teas and rivers are
ftorcd wiih the greatest variety' and plenty of ft!h, and its forcfts
with deer, and other al'eful animals, which supply the new fet
tlfrs with ptovifionsâin short, this quarter of the world is une
qualled on the globe tor its natural advantages.
The next circumftauce to be confidcred, is the government. As
no people can long prolper without a good government, this isof
high importance ; and in this particular the United States, areas
hapovas they are in their natural fuuation ; their government is
eftablilhed on the basis of public welfare, and its principles the
refji; of reason and the experience of aliases. It has also this
funPrlative excellency, a principle of improvement in it, by which
the people may, at any time, when a majority judge it nectlfai*v,
makf amendments. By this admirable principle, all tumults and
revolutions, which have convulsed and ruined othen nations, mav
be forever prevented ; for whenever a majority wffti for aberra
tions they can ctf< ft them by a vote. If ihe minority unreason
ably Hamuli' - , they wi'l throw their words to the wmd, and if
thev t.fe force, they will be treated as rebels againlt liberty.
Therefore the goyernnirnt of this country may justly be confider
cd as the prrf:ft freedom, and the most permanent,that ever
exist d. N> ither the kinjly, or republican governments, of an
cient or modern times, will bear a comparison with the Unwed
States of America, either for excellency or duration. Nothing
less than a total pervcrfiori of human minds, produce

We wili next consider the floinilHiitg Aate of the country ftnee
therrtablifh rentofih ir excellent -government,and theimprove
m rtt the people a e makmg of their natural advantages. Orje.of
th molt ft piking features, which arrcfts the attention of all -re
fitting nvnds, is the rapid population. By the late enumeration,
it appears, that ihe United States have about jour millions of neo
ph ! a growth, w<is never before seen under the fun. Their
progrefsin aÂ»ts and sciences, in a'grieii lure, mahnlaftures and
commerce, have more than equalled the rapidity of population.

their future advances, and build w.th all human certainty on events

P'.'RLIC credt being efl". ntial to the welfare of the people, they
can never hope ioi permanent prosperity until hinds are pro
vid <\ and sacredly employed to pay their debts. Therefore, Con
gress with great wisdom funded the public del t% and provided
for the pivment of the inter* If, and gradual cxtinftion of the prin
cipal. The revenue fyftetn was formed, and is executed with
such discernment thai public credit has rjfen in the Uil'ted State
in a drgfee (inparallel'ed in the world ; and the geneial prosperi
ty of the people has also increafcd beyond calculation. No'hing
is now wanting to complete and perpetuate the geneial welfare,
but a ft-~ady pursuit of the means wh'ch have been so emincn'l)
fiiccefsful. Asa finking fund is paTt of the system, and has already
t begun its operation, and as the money pitfduced by the sale o'
lands 's solely appropria'cd to this purpose, with the proceeds o!
the Port-Office,together with the surplus of the momy tailed by
all imp )fts and cxcifes,- her paving the neceirarv expenses of go
vernment, it is reafonai -.-< xprÂ£\cd the public .debts will be ra
pid! v reduced until their final extinttion. Although the funding |
and revenue system has not been two years in operation, the reve
nue already exceeds the cxnenfesof government, and in addition
lo the interefl of flic debt, large funis of the principal have been
paid. Andasihe revenue will increase wi'h a rapidity equal to
the growth of the country, the finkingfund tnuft enlarge from two
caufcs, whofc operations will perpetually augment each other ;
thercffyi&ion of expenses as the debt It (Tens, and the growing rc
vmu?âThe period may not be far distant when the government
may bg employed to appropriate the revenue to such public pur
oofes as will most advarffce and insure the grcatcft interest and hap
jjsine's of the people. As 01 â¢ capital.mean to a:c.eler Â»te a day 'o

PubliJJjed in Martinique, on the "]th of J'tly, by the
King's Coinviijfioners, ftnt to enjorct th? law o\ th'

that Colony.
IMPRESSED with the of our nvfltort, and e?eerto
â¢ nlwre itsfuccefs, we have hitherto taken, for the rule of our
conduct, a principle which as Hrongly prevails in our hearts. aÂ«- i
is laid down in our inftru&ioiisâthai our mmiftry is a mmiftry
ot peace, not ot n^ur.
In rfFcft, we are the organs of the rriother country, and the de
pofrartesof her will, winch (he has charged us torarrv into exe-
Qwion, Mnon(r Frentbnven, hÂ» r sons, and our brethren. We ha<l
therefore reason Â»o think, that it > ould have been fuflicieni torus
to speak in the name of the nation, the law and the kirn; : and
thai tnftant obedience would be paid, and order and Â«cgal lubor
<Jinatimi rellorrd.
- And mutt we relinquifb ftieb flitter'ng bones ? Snail 'be bene
volrnt views ot the nation and the king be difappointcd ? After
having tried every mcafure, that pa'ience, moderation, and the
K)veof peace, could mud we now be o' ' i \cA 10 have re
conrfe to coerrive mÂ« an?, in order to ens refpeft u> 'he law }
The objetk of that law is, the general |>?etfiearion of the \\ nd

Yet it is Frenchmen who inhabit it!âchildren, who, deaf to
their mother's voice, thus facrifice her favors and their own in
erefts, to their private palfian.sand refentment! âbrothers, whom
it is neceflary 10 reftraiq fi:>m cut ling Â«-ach other's throats!
A simple error is but of short duration. When the intention
is pure, the mind is easily brought back to reason. When the
common cause is a* flake, all Drivate pretensions are forgotten, all
animosities are appeased. But it :s evident, that there do exist
men fudicientlv wicked, fufhcjently iÂ»ad,to persist. in their private
resentment, to ferment that of others, to endeavor to perpetuate
difordcr, and to rekindle the flames of war in this colony.
A proof of this wicked diipofition appears in those threats dic
tated by party Cpirit, against individuals of the op polite partyâ
in those acts of violence committed in several places, against their
peifoil's and their property âin that universal terror which has
spread through the ifland,and p-oauccs daily emigrations.
If the legal authority has proved irtfiifficient to prevent such ex
cefl" s, which almost all originated.iii mysterious darkness, it be
comes only the more ncccifary tocheck their progress, and to in
flict a signal punishment on those who lhall be difcovercd to be
the authors.
In confequencrâhaving received information of the late infu -
reft ion at Satin Pierre, on thegdinft. and being convinced by
this mortifying example, that steps.less fciiousindeed, but not less
criminal, had preceded, and that private quane)?, and the pi oft
trifling acts of violence committed HV 4wo individuals, are fuffici
ent to cause a general ferment in that cityâwe renew the prohi
bitions already expreHed- in our proclamation of the tj.ih of last
April, forbidding all persons, of -yhat rank focver, to offer, any
insult, or commit any ast, whereby peace and good order may be
"violated, cf\l of being profecuied and punilbed, according to
the rigour of the law.
We Jjk.ew.ifc forbid all peifons, iiujfer what pretext soever, to
cry out, To Arms, or to appear in armed bodies in the streets, on
pain of death, in conformity to the ordinances.
We declare, that we will ufc ever/ forcible means in our power
to fuze whoever shall contravene tiis proclamation, and to put
injLo immediate execution the fenten:e pronounced on the authors,
abettors and accomplices of such infurteftions. And from the
neceflijy of coercing, by striking examples, those who have, for
so Ibng a time, forgotten and despised the laws, we htVe enjoined
the public officers to make all necefTary researches, that inlonna
tioo nÂ»ay be given, without delay, refpefting the unlawlul
ceedings which have lately spread the alarm in the city of St.
Pierie ; and to ast conformably to our former rcquihtion, relative
to 1 he dtflurbers of the public tranquility.
We direst and order all the tribunals, and all those whom it
may concern, to publish this proclamation in their refpeftive dif
| trifts, and to aid and ailift in carrying it into execution, so far as
each is concerned.

The spirit of revolt, the embers of which are

powerful restraint on the interposition of the

The Empress' i An finer to the Minijlers of the allied
poiotrs by Count d'Ojhrman.
" Whenever the courts of Berlin and London
and other powers, made known to the Empress
their desires of feeing the war, which unhappi
ly broke out- between Kuffia and the Porte, spee
dily finiflied, her Majelty always shewed such in
clination as fully demonstrated a perfect con
currence in the wilhes of such powers, of which,
in all thtf cabinets, are to be fonnd the nioft in
controvertible proofs
" The ineiaorial delivered on the 26th of May
new stile) by the minilters of the two fiift na
med powers, only mentions, in general terms,
the procuring fafety for the Ottoman Porte in
the next peace, and of commencing a negocia
tion on that fubjetfl. Her Majesty can penetrate
its objetft and aim the less, as the flatters herfelf
in having offered all that peaceablenefs, geneio
fity, and condefcention, suggested to her tor the
general convsn'unces (perhaps circumllanas would
be a better word) confident with her dignity,
the juflice of her cause, *tnd lier care for the
fafety and tranquility of her empire.
" For, after having been unlawfully challen
ged and attacked, as is well known to all the
world,and which bave been particularly acknow
ledged and confelled formerly by the courts of
London and Berlin ; after a heavy expenlive
war during four years, though on the pare of
Ruiiia it has been attended with uninterrupted
advantages, and which have put her in polieliion
of several provinces and (frrong places, under the
Turkiih dominion ; the Empi ess, conformable
to the laws adopted and acknowledged by all na
tions, ought to have a due right of keeping the
whole of these conqtiefts, or at least a part, as a
jufl, but yet too finall an indemnification for so
many disasters, and incalculable of which
the heavy burden has been supported all the
time by her dominion.
" However, her Majesty being inspired with
moderation and difintereltednefs, has not hesi
tated to make a facrifice of all the advantages
which the progref3 of her arms fsemedto promise
her, by making 110 conditions for herfelf, ex
cepting only to secure the (lability of a peace
which she wilhes to conclude, by fixing a new
frontier, and which frontier far from exposing
the defenfive fafety of the Porte, on the contra
ry insures it, as it removes all canfes of difference
and contentions, which an immediate neighbor
hood is too much liable to do, and which has be
come a source and occasion of dilFentions and
bloody wars.
" A river, like that of the Neifter, offers a
frontier as natural, as fit to prevent, in the pro
gvefs of time, all the above-mentioned inconve
niences, without having any particular influence
(which can easily be demonlti ated) 011 the pow
er of both parties interefled ; her Majelly thinks
it necessary to infill upon this demarkation of
frontier, the more so, as ihe thereby makes it a
gree to profpeds which the Courts of Berlin and
London leem to have at heart for the fafety of
the Ottoman Porte, and for the preservation of
the lasting and univei sal tranquility of Europe,
which the Empress has also ever made a fubjeifl
of her continued and moll animated care.
" Guided by these motives, evidently ;he basis
of equity and justice, her Majesty lias ordered
her ministers to declare to the Courts of Berlin
and London, thatihe Itill continues in the lame
peaceable and moderate sentiments which ftie
has ever Ihewn ; and thatihe will avail herfelf
with the greatest pleafureof every impartial and
amicable step which the courts (hall think pro
per, for the continuation of the salutary works
of peace, provided her dignity and the welfare
of her subjects be provided for in fucha manner
as ajuft cause and reason prescribes and requires.

before the cattle, where being drawn up in the
presence of a great concourse of fj>ec r tators they
were viewed by his excellency lord Dorchester

PORTLAND, (MalT.) Sept. 19.
A writer in the Liverpool paper of July 21ft,
calls eai neftly on the inhabitants of that place
to erea a number of new Churches, for the ac

fand poor personsâos whom upwards of thirty
thousand are altogether unprovided with places
of public worship. " We fee thousands of the
lower fort," adds he, " in defiance of all law
and decency, profaning the Sabbath, and loiier

Jfthofe ofthe e[tabiifh;d Church in Birming

their brethren in Liverpool, we may readily ac
count for their late horrid proceedings. How
should men fear a God whom they had never

HEALTHY ratn require a little above fix hours
flee]); healthy women a little above seven in four
and twenty. If any one desires to know exac'ily
what qjaniity of fleei) his own conliitutiou re
quires, lie may very easily make the experiment
which I made about sixty years ago. I then
waked every night about twelve or one, and lay
awake for some time. I readily concluded, that
this arose from being longer in bed thaii nature
required. To be fatisfied, I procured an alarum,
which waked me the next morning at seven (hear
an hour earlier than I rose rhe day before) yet I
Jay awake again at night. The fccond morning
I rose at fix; but notwithllanding this, I lay a
wake the second night. The third morning I
rose at five ; but. nevertheless, I lay awake the
third night. The fourth morning I rose at four,
as, by the grace of God, I have done ever since.
And I lay awake no more. And I do not now
lie awake> taking the year round, a quarter of
an hour together in a month. By the fame ex
peviment, rising earlier and earlier every morn
ing, may one find how much lleep- he really
w.ints.
Philadelphia, October 5.
Friday ihe 30th September, the tune limited by law for receiv
ing Subscriptions to the Loan of the United States, expired. On
that day, we are informed thatSubfcnp.ious for <> Million Dollars
were received, and the public offices were kept open till 12 o'clock
at night.
The plan for funding the Continental Debt appears to have re
ceived a very genera] approbationâof the twenty-seven millions
estimated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, upwards
of twenty millions arc already subscribed.
By the Schooner- Hardy, Capt. Green, which
failed from Cape-Francois the I2th ult. and ar
rived here on Saturday last, we have received
intelligence, that the mulauoes and free blacks
hare got fire-arms, &c. out of the King's store at
the Cape, and done more execution against the
black insurgents than the white inhabitants had
been able to effecft : above 3000 of the insurgents
have been killed.
The embargo was taken off American veflels
at the time of Capt. Green's failing ; but it was
thought there would probably be another em
bargo laid in cai'e the dillurbances were not qui
eted.
The insurgents having beat off a {loop of war
which was going round to seize some cannon at
Port-au-Paix, several American f'ailors went on
board the Hoop, and fought bravely under the
command of Captain Lillybridge.âit isf.iid that
the Ihot which was fired from the (loop of war,
were picked up by the blacks and fired back again.
A letter from a relpectable house in Cape-
Francois to his conefpondent in Philadelphia,
expressly fays, that 180 plantations have been
ilellroyed.
Anion git all the hardships under which the
whites jiow labour, it is a great consolation that
they are not in want of provisions,and that there
is fufficient for fix months.
11l addition to the above we learn, that great
numbers of the women and children of the blacks
bad surrendered ihemfelves at the Cape, where
attempts had been made to set fire to the town,
but were happily fruit rated. Several of the
blacks taken pri (oners', previous to their execu
tion declared that they were iultigated to thole
attempts by some white men, who were conceal
ed among the insurgents, and adviled them to
thole measures as the belt way to recover their
liberty, kc. The blacks are aimed with guns,
piltols, swords, knives, and other inftrumen.s of
delhutftion, and were collected in large bodies
within three or four miles of Cape Francois, and
were very desperate ; but it was impoflible to
ascertain their numbers, which confuted only of
such as werecapable of offence, their women, chil
dren and old men not being permitted to flay
near their camps.
Le Logocrai'hh,Journal Nation* if, a
Paris Paper, contains a complete account of the
debates of the National Affen.bly, taken in the
mode described in a number of this paper some

of tbis publication.
" The debates of the National Aflembly are

The plan for eftabii'fhirtg manufatftufes upon
an e xtenlive scale, which l.is been late.ly-fnbmit
ted to the public confidergtipn, meets with such
general approbation, thac subscriptions al
ready amount to much inoiie than one half the
In 111 proposed to be raised.;
It is but a few years fince'the opinion was very
common, that manufactures could not be eftab
liflied in this councry 011 an extensive and profita
ble plan. The want of hands, and the tempta
tions held out to the poor in the cheapness of our
unfetiied lands, it was supposed would for many
years preclude the polfibihty of carrying 011 ma
nufactures to advantage. It will however appear
on a lecrofpt-Otive view of affairs, that the above
were not the molt formidable obltacles in the way
of manufactures ; not only /lew enterprizes were
opposed by the wretched lituation of the conti
nental and Hate 'governments, but even those
branches of mechanics and manufactures, with
which we were fully acquainted, and to which
long experience had proved our competency had
declined ; and had not an alteration taken place,
our fhip-cai penters, and the nutnerous trades and
profeflions connected with the business of ship
building, would all have been obliged to emi
grate from the United States ; great numbers did
actually go to the British settlements.
Good government, jult Jaws, and a restoration
of public credit, on thele depended our salvation
âonthefe depended every entei prizeâand as
soon as these were eftablilhed, what has been the
confequenre ? In feme of" the States feveta)
branches of manufatftuie are prosecuted with
success, which it was once thought it would have
been madness to have attemp edâother branch
es are pui sued in other Statesâand on trial, it
is found that the quality of our fabrics is superi
or to European, while they can be afforded at as
reduced p'ices as similar articles imported from
abroad.âExperience will doubtless convince us,
that we can extend our plan to a variety of arti
cles ; for, it will be found that in the coarferfa
brics in particular, we pay more than they can
be made and fold for in this country.
Tranjlation of a letter from Cape-Francois, dated September n.
Since our last of the 22d ult. the face of things is quite changed
here by an infurreftion of the slaves, which broke out on the 23d,
in this quarter, from Port Margot to Limonade, being an extern
oi twenty leagues. They set fire 10 all the houses, and butchered
all the white people ihey found in them. Having rendered them
selves mailers of all the open country, they leparated into bodies
of three or four hundred each,polling ihetrifelves in different houses
which serve them as places of refuge. The small number of troops
we have to occupy ftveral advantageous ports, which defend the
c ty, docs not allow us to do moi-e than sally out against them
from time to time, when they approach too near. If we had a
greater number of regular troops, we niight invest them in their
lurking pLccs. These ravagersare too numerous to be attacked ;
as rhey have obliged all the houfe-flives, even against their will,
to join them, and maflacred such a attempted to make their escape.
After having ravaged all the levil, populous country, they made
their way through many exterior settlements, and "here the un
fortunate few soon fell victims to their rage. They fei fire to eve
ry thing on their way.
We have lent to the United States, to request the afliftance of
some troops to aflift us in deflroying these ravagers. But are we
roexpe&them ? We have sent also to Jamaica, and to ;hc Spa
niards. We wait with impatience for the return of our meflengers,
and earnestly hope they may bring us fatisfaftory answers. Our
only security is thiscity, which is fortified and well guarded. A
the commencement of these disturbances, our chief apprehensions
were from our domestic slaves, who were in great numbers, and
might perhaps be in league with the insurgents, to set fire to our
houses. But our vigilance, by day and by night, has preserved
us from iheir fufpefted designs. Sevcial have however, been ftiz
ed, and brought to justice. The others, who were not fufpe&ed.
have nevertheless been put in a place of security. By means of
this prudent precaution, we now enjoy greater tranquility.
At the firft breaking out of these difiurbances, a general em
bargo was laid upon all the vellels in the harbor, without diftin
lion. For the present, our AfTembliw, in concert with the Go
vernor, have determined to permit as many of the American ves
sels to fail, as there Ihould be new arrivals.
Friday last, both houses of the Legislature of the Common-
of Pennsylvania adjourned fine die, having palled, during
the feilion, 24 laws; among which are the following :
An ast affording relief to D ckenfon Colleg-.
An ast to continue the ast for transferring certain powers, for
merly exercised by the Supreme Eiecutive Council, also by the
President or Vice-President thereof to the Governor of this Com
monwealth.
An ast ratifying on behalf of Pennsylvania thefirft amendment
propoftd byCongtcfsto the Conftitutiorl of the United State!.
An aÂ£t to ri peal so much of every ast or acts ot Assembly of
this State, as relates to the Colleftmnof Excil'e duties.
An ast to enable the Governor of thii Commonwealth to incor
porate a company for opening a canal and lock, navigation, be
twetn the river Schuylkill aid Sufquehanna, by the waters of
Tulochoccon, Quittapahilla and Swatara, in the counties ol Bciks
and Dacphin.
An att to provide more effeflually foi.the payment of the pub
lic debts and obligations.
An ast to leimburfe the Mayor, Aldermen, and Cili*"is of
Philadelphia, and to the Commifiionersof the County of Phila
delphia, the expeneesaccrued in providing for the temporary ac
commodation of lhe Piefident and Congress of the United Slates
of North-America, in the Cit) of Philadelphia, and to enable the
Governor to inake futther piovifion for the accommodation of
the said Prcfidcnt
An adt touniie the University of the Stole of Pennfvlvania, and
College, Academy, nd Charuable Scltoyl of Philadelphia, in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
A fuppleinent to the att, entitled, " An ast to establish the ju
dicial courts of this Commonwealth, in conformity to the altera
tion< and amendments in the confutation."
There are in every country pretenders to the
public patronage who poflefe neither abilities or
character to recommend them.
Such persons to the chagrin of honed men, of
ten insinuate theuifelves into the favor of the
183
people by the aid of a brazen front, and a plau
sible knack in propagating falfehoods.
At the present day, superior light and infor
mation appear to direit the public mind ; men
are eftiniated by merit and abilities, not by mere
profeflionsâthis being the cafe, the chance is
againtt those whose whole (lock of recommenda
tory qualifications confills in declaiming againlt
a government whose adminiilration has immedi
ately realized the belt withes of the friends of
our country, and opened the biighiell prospeCtS
for poilerity.
T lie Western Territory of the United States is
said to contain 220,000,000 of acres, inferior in
fertility, salubrity and conveniency, to 110 coun
try upon earth.âWhat a fund for the future exi
gencies of our country !â May the wisdom of our
government keep it from the grasp of unprinciy
pled land jobbers.
What an asylum for the opprefled ! divided
upon agrarian principles, what multitudes may
here find freedom and support. America "opens
wide her arms to embrace millions, and waifs to
crown all the indultrious and virtuous with plenty
and happiness."
Then hither comeâreason's firft law obey
Self prcfervationâfpuru tyrannic swayâ
Here freedom lights her pure ccleftia) fire,
Which, but with time and nature (hall expire.
Several of the States are placed in nioft eligi
ble circuni(lances as Governments, in consequence
of the happy re It oration oft he credit of the Union.
Having large amounts of the public securities in
their treasuries, they are now in the receipt of
an interest which is almost fufficient to fupercede
the necessity of the imposition of taxes for the
support of their refpecftive Governments. Sound
wisdom, and a just regard to the solid advantage
of the people, will however lead to a different
appropriation of the produce of these funds
1 he support of their economical,republican forms
of Government, can never beconfidered as a bur
thenâand the requisite contributions for this pur
pose, will always be chearfully paid.âThe con
tinental funds of the State then can always be
applied to the purposes of improving the roads
and inland navigation, and in encouraging th 6
agriculture and manufactures of the country.
The policy that would fdggeft the expedient
of the Stare's diverting itfelf of these funds, is
like that of a young heir, who to furnilh hinifelf
with present pocket-money, cuts off the thrifty
young wood from his extensive acres.

WHEN night Hied hei folttude round,
And Cynthia iHumin'd the sky,
When dew drops bcfpangled the ground,
And light mill flew wantonly by;
Alone to a neighbouring grove,
With partial dtftra&ion I ftray'd,
There tho't of the maiden I love,
While rapture my senses betray'd
On the wings of delusion I flew
To the feet of the fair one I love,
I told her my paflion anew,
My paflion she deign'd to approve :
There fancy depi&ed our joy,
'Twas pleasure unmingled with woe,
'Twas happiness free from alloy,
'Twas Eden replanted below.
Reclin'd on her bosom of love,
As playful, and happy as May,
Lay an infaht as pure as a dove,
And bright as the young star of day;
The rose budded fair in its face,
Truth and innocence beam'd from its eyes,
Its smiles were the symptoms of grace.
Its charms were the charms of the Ikies.
\
My hoqfe was an inn for the poor,
The beggar was often mv guest,
They fmil'd as they went from my door,
Their gratitude fweetcn'd my reft.â
My Delia was pleas'd to bellowâ
What Providence freely had given
She fhar'd with the children of woe,
And bade them feel thankful to heaven.
While thus in fwect rapture I view'd
The scene which my fancy had drawn,
My feet wamler'd far thro' the wood,
And insensibly trode the gay lawn ;
The sweet briar lent me a rose,
An emblem of life and its cares,
A moment it buds and it blows,
But thorns are the burthen it bears.
I smelt of the fragrance it shed,
'Twas (weet as the breathings of mornâ
I prefs'd itâlow droop'd its fair head,
And nothing remain'd but the thornâ
In a moment my senses returned,
I funk to the depths of despair,
And as the foft vision I mourn'd,
The cries of distress fill'd the air:
The shepherd lay frtug \h his bed
While dogs tore the lambs of the fold;
Too late to their rescue I fled,
Their lives to the prowlers were fold.
No more shall their bleatings delight;
No more fhallthe innocent tram,
In frolicfome gambols unite,
Or fportiveiy fltip o'er the plain.
I wept o'er their carcases torn,
Their pleasures Ijad scarcely began ;
But perhaps had they fern the next morn,
I heir lives had been flaughter'd by man :
My mind thus from ills of mv own
Turn d to those of a lower degree,
I tho't I was wietrffed alone,
But brutes were more wretched than me.
Ah Corydon wbv will vou love !
Why feed the foft paflion in vain !
No sighs her com paflion can move,
She Imiles at the tale of your pain~-
To love her alas} is delight,
'tis blifi to my heart,
Tho'defpair fpreadsaround me her night,
et despair can her bleflings impart.
She is fair as the pride of the vale,
The lily that vies with the snow,
Her breath ;s as sweet as the gale,
Where clover-fields fragrantly blow;
Her temper is sweet and serene,
Here bosom is pure and refiri'd,
Exprcfljon enlivens her mien,
And virtue enriches her mind.
She is chadc as the flceces that fly
On the wings of the tempefl of snow,
Soft pleasure oft beams in her eye,
She can weep at the language of woe;
Her lips utter accents of truth,
Her voice is the music of even,
Her face wears the features of youth
Of youth in the garden of "heaven.
And when with the swain ofherctsoice
She shall wed (may the moment be nigh}'
Tho' bleeding, my heart shall rejoice,
She is happyâl'll bless herâand die:
Not a tear from my eyes shall be shed,
Not a sigh from my bosom arise,
In secret I'll lay down my head,
And wait for the fair in the fkics.
