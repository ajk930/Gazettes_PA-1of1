HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.
THURSDAY, Feb. 28.
ON the motion for referring the resolutions
refpefting the official conduit of tiie Se
cretary of the Treasury to the committee of
the whole,
The two firft resolutions being read, refer
ring them to the committee was objected to; it
â¢was said they were abilrafl proportionsâmay
contain felf evident truths in themselves, but
Jiable to modification in their application to
particular circumstances ; if these are refer
redâthe committe may wale their ti*ne'in
<lifcufung propositions which do not in
to the merits of the main object of the enquiry;
this discussion may and probably would be
spun out to such a length as to preclude a con
sideration of the main object; the charges
adduced against the Secretary. The coofe
cjuence will be that the resolutions will be
printed, go out into the world, and make im
pr#>4foiw op t*ie public mind without being â ac
companied with any statements or reasonings
to counteract or obviate their tendency
That the present enquiry may involve a fur
ther stepâan impeachment; it therefore ap
peared improper for the House to commit it
felfin refpeeV to abftraft portions, which would
tend to embarrass both the Houle and the Se
nate should an impeachment be the confe
rence of the firft discussion.
In answer to these obje&ions it was said,
that it was furel v not the way to obtain a full
difcuflion of a proposition to mutilate that
proposition in the firft instanceâThat every
member has a right to bring forward such
propositions as he thinks properâthat it ap
peared a strange way to decide on the merits
of a proposition, to preclude the House from
a â¢lonfideration of all the parts of such propo
sition.âThat a difference of opinion appears
to exist in the conftruftion of the lawbetween
Congress and the Secretary of the Treasuryâ
That the two firft propositions may be confi
Â«iered in the light of a preamble to a fubfe
<)Â»ent actâwhieh is afterwards susceptible of
ificJ.M4Â»n io any ftegp of th*
deliberation on the a<st, fetter or embarrass
that deliberation.
The last resolution is to this purport, That
a copy of the foregoing resolutions be laid be
fore the President of the United States.
It was remarked 011 this, that the obvious
motive sos it is, that the President may take
a hint to dismiss the officer in question from
officeâthis it was said was giving the Reso
lutions all the force and effect of an impeach
ment; for dismission from office is the only
confeauence of impeachmentâso that the
responsible officer is in this way to fuffer all
the consequences of criminality without one
of the forms prescribed by the constitution in
cases of impeachment.
The following remarks were made by Mr.
Smith, of South-Carolina, on this occasion :
Mr. Smith was decidedly opposed to re
ferring thole resolutions to the consideration
of the committee of the whole house, because
he neither viewed a discussion of them as ne
celTary on the present occasion or warranted
by the nature of the inquiry into the Secre
tary's conduct. It was trifling with the pre
cious time of the House tolavifh it on abftraft
propositions, when the obje<ft of the enquiry
ought to be into facts ; he was fatisfied that
should the House once involve itfelf in an in
vestigation of theoretic principles of govern
ment the short residue of the fellion would
be exhausted, and no opportunity remain for
examining the charges themselves ; t.hofe
charges being made, it became the House
from a sense of duty to the public and jultice
to the accused to proceed immediately tocon
fider them. If the mover intended to apply
the principles of the two fir ft resolutions to
the fatts contained in the subsequent ones, it
was unquestionably proper firft to substantiate
the fa&s and then eftablilh the principles
which were applicable to them, but it was
surely a reversal of order to spend much time
in eftabliihing principles, when it might hap
pen that the charges themselves would be to
tally unsupported. He did not like this mode
of proceediag because it might tend to mis-
Jead the House; it was sometimes a parlia
mentary practice to endeavor to lead the
mind to vague and uncertain results by firft
laying down theorems from which no one
could dissent and then proceeding to imper
ceptible ihades to move unsettled positions in
order ultimately to entrap the House in a
vote which in the firft instance it would have
rejected. This mode of conducting public
hufinefs he confickjred as inconliftent with fair
inquiry. The qneftion was, had the Secreta
ry violated a law ? iffo, let it be shewn ; eve
ry member was competent to decide so plain
a quettion; he could examine the proofs,
read the law, and pronounce him guilty or
innocent without the aid of these preliminary
methaphyfical djfcufllons.
If it were urged that the proportions are so
and obvious that no time wouldbe loft
Saturday, March 9, 1795.
in confuli-ring them, he then bÂ«gged leave to
observe that all antecedent difcnfGons of con-*
ftitutional questions had never failed to occu
py a larjre portion of their time and that how
ever felf evident the resolutions might at the
firft glance appear, a more critical attention
would fatisfy a mind notmuch given to doubt
that they were by 110 means so conclusive as
ta be free from objections.
Though the position contained in the firft:
resolution, as a general rule, was not to be
denied ; yet it malt he admitted that there
may be cases of a fufficient urgency to jufti
fv a departure from it, and to make it the
duty of the legislature to indemnify an officer ;
as, if an adherence would in particular cases,
and under particular circumstances, prove
ruinous to the public credit, or prevent the
taking meafuresefTential to the public fafctt,
against invasion or infurre&ion. In cases of
that nature and which cannot be forefeen by
the le.ifUture, nor guarded against, a dilcre
tionary authority must be deemed to reside in
the President, or some otberexecutive officer,
to be exercised for the public good ; fucn ex
ercise instead of being construed inro a crime,
wotfM always mert ttaf approbation of the
national legislature : if tliere be any weight
in these remarks it does not then follov.* as a
general rule, that it is eflential to the due ad
ministration of the government, that laws
making Specific appropriations should in all
cases whatsoever, and under every polTible
circumstance be ftriÂ£tly observed. Before
the committee could come to a vote on such
a proposition, it would be proper to examine
into the exceptions out of the rule, to state
all the circumstances which would warrant
any departure from it, to whom the exercise
of the discretion should be entrusted, and to
what extent. Did any member wilh at this
period to attempt this enquiry I He supposed
not. Let every deviation fiom law be tested
by its own merits or demerits.
The second resolution v/as liable to stronger
objections ; it might with propriety be ques
tioned whether as a general use the position
was well founded. A law making appropri
ations may be violated in various particulars
without infringing the constitution, which
only enjoins that no monies (hall be drawn
irom tik treasury but in consequence of the
appropriations made by law j this is only to
fay, that every disbursement must be author
ized by foine appropriation ; where a sum of
money is paid out of the treasury, the pay
ment of which is authorized by law, the con
stitution is not violated ; yet there may have
been a violation of the law in some Collateral
particulars ; there may even have been a
fhifting of funds, and however exceptionable
this may be on other accounts, it would not
amount to that species of offence which is
created by the constitution. The comptrol
ler of the treasury must countersign every
warrant, and is responsible that it be author
ized by a legal appropriationâyet it cannot
be supposed that he is to investigate the source
of the fund.
One of the alledged infractions stated in the
subsequent resolution*, namely, the drawing
part of the loans into the United States with
out the inftru&ions of the President, evinces
that the opposite conftruftion is not a found
one, for suppose the fa ft proved, and suppose
it a violation of the law, it certainly would
be a very different thing from drawing mo
ney out of the treasury without an appropri
ation by law, for in this cafe there would be
no drawing money from the treasury at all,
the money never having been in the treasury.
Mr. Smith then said, he should also object
to referring the last resolution, -which is in
these words, Resolved, that a copy of the
foregoing resolutions be transmitted to the
President.
The object of this resolution went clearly
to direst the President to remove the Secre
tary from office : the foregoing were to de
termine the guilt, the last to inflidt the pun
ifhment,and both the one and the other with
out the accused being heard in his defence ;
when the violation of the constitution was so
uppermost in our minds, it would be indeed
aftoniJhing that we should be so hood-winked
as to commit such a palpable violation of it
in this instance. The principles of that con
futation, careful of the lives and liberties of
the citizens, and what is dearer to every man
of honor his reputation, secure to every in
dividual in every class of society, the prc
cious advantage of beirg heard before he is
condemned.
That constitution, peculiarly careful of the
reputation of fcreat public funttionaries, di
rects that when acciifed of a breach of duty,
the impeachment must be voted by a majority
of the House of Repreientatives, and tried by
the Senate, who are to be on oath, and two
thirds of whom must concur before a sentence
can pass, by which the officer is to be deemed
guilty-âThe officer is to be furnifhed with a
copy of the charge, and is heard by himfe!f or
his counsel ill vindication of his conduct.â
Such ie the fo'emnities and guards by which
they are protested, and which precede a sen
tence, the only effect of which is a removal
from office. But if the House proceed in the
321
mantfc'r contemplated hy this TPfoUrtwm, if
thfcy. firft vu te the chargevand lend a
of them to the Pieiid-.nt, as an inflection to
him to remove the officer, they will violate
the sacred and fundamental prn :cipiesof thi?,
and every free they wjjl con
demn a man unheard, nay, without his having
even been furniftied with the charges
him j they will condemn to infamy a high
and responsible officer, eopviCled by the Re
presentatives of the people, <>1 a violation of
the important trusts committi d to him, with
out affording bim one opportunity of vindi
cating his character and juftifying his conduct.
In committe* of the whole, Mr. Muhlen
berg in the chair, on the 3d, 4th, sth,
6th, 7th, and Bth ltfolutions, as pub
lifted in the Gazette of Wednesday
last.
MR. Giles, the original mover of the
refolutions,rofe. He was fenlible,
he said, that he flood in a peculiarly de
licate. iituation, iu which nothing
,tkÂ« public good, could have indited him
to place himfelf. If a public and highly
responsible officer had violated the laws,
it was neceflary that he should be called
to an account for it ; and to determine,
whether in the inrtances before the house
he had been guilty of that violation, it is
neceflary to compare the teftimouy with
the facts alledged in the resolutions befoie
the committee. He firft adveited to the
law authorising the President of the Unit
ed States to borrow 12 millions of dol
lars, for the purpose of paying the foieigft
debt. On this he remarked, that the au
thority of borrowing was expressly given
to the President, no doubt with an eye to
the personal virtues of the charafier who
fills that office } the loan is also diredted
to be made, solely for the purpose of pay
ing the public debt. Here he remarked,
that in every appropriation-law the appio
prrAtlun iÂ» always emphwifcaily mtifition
ed, which is an evidence that the legisla
ture intend to remain the sole judges of
the applications of money. He read a let
ter from the Secretary of the Treasury,
who was employed by the President to ne
gotiate this loan, to Mr. Shoit, the Se
cretary's foreign agent 'for this purpose,
dated ihe 9th May 1791, i" which the
Secretary informs Mr. Short, that one
million and a half of the money he had
obtained on loan was destined for Franct ;
of which sum he was authorised to apply
immediately one million, but to relei ve
800,000 florins to answer subsequent di
rections he should receive from the treasu
ry. He cited this paflage to fliew-that the
million and an half which had been ob
tained on loan, was defined for France.
To remove any doubt that might re
main npon this head, he referred to a pre
ceding letter from the Secretary to Mi.
Short, dated the 13th of April, in which
it is also expiefsly said, that of the two
millions borrowed, one million and an
half is intended for France, the remaining
half million to wait for further dire&ions.
Having eflablifhed this point, he advert
ed to the resolution before the committee,
which fays, that he applied a portion of
the principal borrowed to the payment of
the interest falling due upon that princi
pal, without being authorised so to do by
any law. To (hew this he referred to a re
port of the 3d January, containing sun
dry statements refpefting foreign loans.
That part of the report to which he allud
ed in proof of the fad, dated in general
terms, a sum paid on account of foreign
loans, and this sum was taken from the
principal borrowed, and amounted to
189 florins. If his statement was
accurate, the fad he wilhed to eftablifli
was, he said, proved. He wanted more
light, however, he confeffed, than he
could colled from the Secretary's official
communications. He should not go into
the examination of what circumitancts
might have induced the Secretary to devi
ate from the poGtive injunctions of the
law, or to make any remarks upon his
condud, until he had heard what gentle
men would fay to controvert the fad he
wished to eftablifli.
Another fa A of confluence be wiflied
[Whole No. 405.]
to prove, viz. that part of the money ob
tained on loan in Europe bad been drawn
over, though not wanted here fui any pub
lie purpose : this appeared, he (aid, from
other papersâHe turned to the iintitic
tions from the Prelident to the Secietery
of the tre a fin y, authorizing him to bor
row fourteen millions of dollars, in which
the Secretary is cautioned to keep in view
the two several atts authoring the loans,
and the diftinft conditions they content
plate. By the inltru&ions of the Preli
fident the Secretary is authorised to apply
the monies. In the execution of the trult
confided to him, the Prelident generally
dire&s him to employ Mr. Short to nego
ciate the loans, to borrow in the manner
prescribed by the aÂ«Sts, and to discharge
immediately the arrears of interest due to
the French, to which purpose and tt> the
complete payment ef that debt, the 12
million loan was appropriated.
If this money, then, was fliewn to have
been drawn here, it was neither warrant
ed by law nor by the Prefident'g inltruc
tions. The Secretary d'd begin to draw
as early as 1790, and had continued to
draw from time to time, till 1793. with
out giving notice of this to the legislature.
Having (hewn that the Secretary had
drawn without authority to draw, he next
proceeded to consider the object of thole
drafts.
The money thus drawn for was not,
he dated, applied to the purchase of the
public debt ; no money obtained from fo
reign loans was thus applied until this
year ; the resources appropriat
ed to this objedt were never exhaufled.
These were the fadts involved in the firft
resolution, which he \vifhed to eflablifti :
before he proceeded further into the dif
cuilion, he Ajeilhed to hear what gentlemen
had to fay to controvert them. He wiftted
to fee jullice doiie in the bufincf* before
the house ; he meant justice, also, to be
tempered with moderation and mercy,
and if gentlemen could fliew a necedlt v for
the deviations from positive law, whichhc
had endeavoured to point our, it would
exonerate the Secretary from a very great
share of blame.
Mr. Barnewell called for the reading of
certain paits of the two acts authorising
the loans. Out, of the 4th of August, ati
thorifes a loan ps 12,000,000 to be ob
tained without limitation as to the inter
ell, for the purpose of foreign
debt, the other is of the 12th of Angufl,
for 2,000,000, the interest to be not more
than 5 per cent, and for the purpose of
reduciug the domcllic debt.
Mr. Sedgwick lamented'the fhortnef*
of the time for the difcuflion of an obje&
of so milch impoi tance to the party accu
sed, and in which the honor of the go
vernment ami the peafce and quiet of the
community were so deeply interested.
For what object, he was thi6 extra
ordinary invelligation at this time ? It
was not for the dete&ion of fraud, cor
tuption, peculation ? Thef? chargeswere
relinquiflied, and now the prosecution
was confined merely to enquiry whe
ther this officer had discreetly and ably
discharged the important duties assigned
to him; whether he had observed by
(hillings and pence, during the conrfe of
his adminifttation, the precise limits of
his authority, in points of appropriation;
and whethrer, fiom confcions innocence,
he has dared to express to thin House, the
natural fentimer.ts of an injured and me
-1 itoiious officer in language ofFenfive from
being too plain not to be understood, and
too bold not to give offence, in short, io
the language of freedom. Gentlemen
did not hesitate, for these unimportant
purposes, to r.onfume the greater portiqn
of the few days allotted to our political
exiltence, and even attempt to agiute by
founding an alarm, the public mind from
St. Croix to St. Mary's : and for what
ends ? Did the gentlemen prosecuting
propose an impeachment ? No, they r*-
prefsly disavowed any such intent ion. Fcr
what other puq>ofe we were authorize A
Vto Intrude as 'iccaOj, as grofecutors into
the executive department, Gentlemen
had not yet declared. 1 lie events wouM
declare how agrec.ible it wn., to the peo
ple of America, I fiat the House of Re
prcfentativt:6 should attempt to contract
the Prclideiit in tlie free exercise of his
difcretioii in fei*Â£ling the proper inttiu
iiteritl o! executing the laws. 1 lie pro
secutors in their z-al hud forgot that it
was effeiitial to rierfonal feeurity and free
dom,that a per ton fhoilld not be condemned
without an opportunity of being lieaid m
his defence; no such opportunity had
been indulged the man, whose icputation
dearer to him as a man of honor, titan
life, was attacked. He was willing howe
vei, to proceed to the difcufiion ot the
qucllion before the committee ; and in
tegard to the tefolution immediately un
der confideratiou, and to those which
would fncceed in their order, as far as he
might take pa>t, he should only (late the
fatts in relation to the quellion immedi
ately under debate, and endeavour to
point out that relation. If these fails
should be established and those relations
underlined, he would run the venture to
predict, that the sensibility by which the
ingenious and intelligent Ameiican mind
is attached to the objedt of the prosecu
tion, from a confidence in his integrity
and talents, will be greatly increased.
The resolution immediately under con
fideiation, charges the Secretary with vi
olating the law of the '4th of Augult by
ill. Applying a portion of the princi
pal borowed under that aÂ£l towards pay
ing the interest of it.
ad. By drawing part of the monies
into the United States, without .the in
ftruftionsof thePrefident.
Refpe&ing the I ft. particular, he le
quefted gentlemen to attend to a Ample
statement of the facts. Money was in
Europe applicable to purposes of appro
priation in America. This being imme
diately conne&ed with the 2d. paiticular
chargt-d in the refolutiori, ai.d it being
inftparably involved with other f acts re
lating to that particular, he would now
aflume it as a fact That money was in
Europe appropriated to the aid of the
finking fund, and which therefore might
be brought here, the real fcane of its>de-
Aination. It was also true that the mo
ney arising from our domestic ttfources
being destined to pay the interest on the
foreign loans, we had of course money
here destined to foreign purposes. To
introduce the exploded nonsense under
these cifcumftances of the ear-marks of
meney, seems the objedl of the charge,
which for no ufeful purpose would fub
jeft us to the rifle and expence of fending
the money to Europe and of bringing
the fame money from Europe here. What
did the Secretary ? He borrowed from
one fund, he repaid with the other. He
avoided all rifle and expence. He fully
executed the purposes of the government.
He did, in Â£a6l, what any prudent, ho
ne ft agent would have done for his prin
cipal, what every man of common sense
would have done for himfclf. Had he
pursued another course, had he tranfpoit
ed money from Europe to America and
from America to Euiope in the instance
before the committee, it might be said
with truth that he had given conclusive
evidence of a paltry genius, wholly un
worthy of the high itation in which he is
placed.
The next particular was that he had
drawn part of the money borrowed under
the ast of the 4th of August, into the U.
States, without the inftruftions of the
Picfident ?'
Should the truth of this charge be ad
mitted, it might be alked what authority
had the House of Representatives to in
terfere ? Was not this an ufurpa'tion ?
Were we now to go into a confederation
of the refpeftive fubjcfts afGgned the se
veral departments of government ? Or
was the House under the plausible pre
tence of purifying the executive, to usurp
the appropriate ajid most nectflary pow
ers of that department? To whom was
intruded the execution of the loan ? To
the Prcfideqt, not the House of Repre
sentatives. Who was to feleft the instru
ments of execution ? Who was, to remove
from office? Could the houfe,by any arti
cle of the constitution interfere in vemo
.val from office, but in the process of im
peachment, which is declared not to be an
objeÂ£t of the picfeat prosecution ? He
.would not here reft the defence, though
the que (lions he had alked fuggelled id.as
worthy the confideratiou of those to whom
they were .\ddrefled, and of the public.
Before he proceeded to the mod imt
portantciicumiUncesrelatingtothischargr,
lie woukl take notice of the evidence Â«>n
which the gentlemen relied. It was rnerej
ly of a. presumptive natureâa prelumptU
on he said he would Itake his refutation
in believing wholly in Confident with the
character of the President or his Secreta
ry. Was it the character of the Presi
dent, to admit fubjeÂ£ts of valt magnitude,
committed to his management to be con
ducted without his knowledge, by his im
mcdiateandconfidential minitters? Would
he not expel from his confidence the min 1
who should dare thus to conduct.
On the other hand, is it poflible to sup
pose that the Secretary could have pre
sumed to have abused the confidence of
the man on whose pleasure his exiflence
absolutely depended ? It could not then
be supposed confident with the character
of either gentleman that any necefTary
information could be withholdenâthat
any important (lep would be taken by the
fubordinatt; officer, without iuftruClions
where.those inltrudtions wotild be necefTa
ry oi expedient ; and that should he fail
in that attention which the nature of his
relatiou, and the fubjedts under his ma
nagement required, it was a natural pre
emption, that the President would do
what was proper to be dor,e. Certain it
was that it was not fubjeflt to any consti
tutional controul of the House of
fentatives. '
He said, that by the confti'tution of the
Treasury department the general fupeiin
tendance of the finances was committed
to the Secretary. That by the ast of the
4th of Augult, 1790! which would be a
gain mentioned : The Piefident was au
thorised to caufeto be borrowed 12,000,000
it would be a question, whether, when
this money was borrowed, the general fu
perintendance of it was not in viitue of
the ast, conflicting the Treasury depart
ment committed to the Secretary. If this
was the true.conllruftion no inftruftions
would be necefiary to enable the Secreta
ry to make the appropriations pointed
out by law. This, however, not being
neceflary to be relied on, he mentioned
only cideniinally.
He observed, that the money to be
borrowed under that ast was solely appro
priated to the difch'arge of art ears and in
ftallinents, payingofFthe fote'igii debt.
He wilhed that the committee would be
pleased to notice as a fact to be-particu
arly remembered, that there was no re
ltriftions as to the time of borrowing ; on
ly that they (hould be advantageous to
the United States, and of this there was
no criterion; the only security of the pub
lic was the discretion of the President :
It would thetefore never be a question,
whether a loan made at 5 per cent interest,
and 4 per cent, premium was within the
authority' delegated.
. He said that it. had been denied that 3-
ny of the money borrowed in virtue of
this ast could be drawn into this country.
This was in his opinion wholly unfounded.
He afifed where were the words that con
tained this restraint ? He said, that all tjhf.
money borrowed might, confident with
the law have been drawn hither, iuvefted
in produce, and that produce been deli
vered in diicbarge of th? debt; and that
in fact a very large portion had within the
knowledge of every gentleman present
been applied to that purpose, and very,
advantageously to country'. He said
if the President ftiould believe it advanta
geous to the public he might not only
draw the money here for the purposes
mentioned, but fend it 'to China or to
Lapland.
He said, that by the ast of the 12th of
Augull, in the fame year, a further autho
rity was given to the President, to bor
row 2,000,000 of dollars, to be applied
to the purchase of the debt ; but in this
cafe the interest could not exceed 5 per
cent. Previous to the passing of this ast
our bankers had made a proviHtniaUo**
3,000,000 of florins. It was aflced whe
ther any part of this loan could be said to
be applicable to the purposes of the last
mentioned ast, or in other words for aid
ing the finking fund ? And was it drawn
here with the knowledge of the Prclident ?
A iimple statement of facts, he said, would
form the bell answers to both these quef-
tions.
It was, he said, stated by the Secretary
as early as thp 25th Aug. 1790, that this
provilional lrjpn was made, that it might
be at command iÂ« the course of the then
322
year. That the expediency of its accept
ance, and the application of one thiiJ of
it to the purposes of the act of the 12th
of Auguit, was under the conlideiation of
the Prelident. At that time, then, which
was the earlielt pojlible moment, it was
known to the PreGdent that the loan was
made; it was known to the ligiflature
what would be the probable application
of it, and yet he laid it was now preten
ded that every body was kept 111 total ig
norance. This, he said, was not all, oil
the 28th of the fame Auguit the Pieti
dent authorised the fecretaty to cxecut
, the power of botrowing uniLr the autho
rity of both aits, and to the amount of
14,000,000 dollars, would it be said that
thi whole money was intended by the
Prelident to be applied to the foreign
debt ? This would be charging him with
an intention more ctiminal than had been
alledged againfl the Secretary ; for he
was not authorized so to apply more than
12,000,000. In the fame month the se
cretary latified the provilional loan of
3,000,000 of florins, and expiesfly decla
red it to be in virtue of the conjunct au
thority of the two loans.
This, he said, was not all. At the
opening of the next session, on the Bth
of December, 1790, and it was to be ob
served that the firft drawing of the mo
ney into this country commenced on the
15th of tliac month, the President in his
speech communicated the loan, and ex
pressly said, that it was made " in con
formity to the powers veiled in him by the
acts of the lalt session." Had not the le
gislature then the earliest possible informa
tion of the loan and of its intended appli
cation ? In the fame fpecch the President
informed the legislature, in relation to
this fubjeft, that the Secretary had his
direction to communicate such further
particulars as might be requisite for more
precise information. Afterwards, in the
fame session, the Secretary had given the
precise information which was directed by
the President; he ftatedthe terms of the
loan, which were at 5 percent, inter It ex
clusive of premium, &c. and said that
from thence a doubt had arisen, whether
it was within the meaning of the ast of
the 12th of Augult ; that in his opinion,
it was very expedient and highly import
ant to the general operations of the treasu
ry, that it should be deemed to be within
that act. That the residue beyond what
had been appliedto the forcigndebt might
be applied .to the purposes of that aft.â
In pursuance ot this information, the le
giflayire, to remove the doubts which had
been expreficd by the Secretary in,the said
session, pa! Ted an ast, declaring that that
loan " should be con (trued, and dbemed
to be within the true intent and meaning
of the ast for the reduction of the public
debt," and extended the operation of the
ast to any future loans which should be
made 011 the fame terms. He asked leave
to remind the committee of what he had
before dated, tljat there was no reftriftion
as to interelt ot piemium to be allowed
for loans made under the ast of the 4th
of August ; it would therefore, he said,
follow irrefutably, that the legislative in
terference was not only unneceflary, but
absurd, on the idea that ,no part of this
loan was to be applied to other purposes
than the foreign debt ; the words, too,
of the ast, rendered the Intention perfect
ly unequivocal and certain. Nor, he said,
did the whole proof reft in the docu
ments to which he had referred the con
sideration of the committee. That tiio
ney had been drawn into America arising
from foreign loans had been Hated to the
legislature at the commencement of their
next session after passing the last mention
ed act. This was by the Treasurer's ac
cbunt then reported to Congress, which
was explained and verified by the Comp
troller's report, to which he referred the
committee. The fame information had
from time to time been given by the
Treasurer, as money had been received
by him from this source. He concluded
,by requelting gentlemen to review the evi
dence he 4iad mentioned, and then, as
their minds should determine, pronounce
whether there was any foundation for fay
ing that no part of the tirft loan was appli
cable to the purposes of the ast of the 12th
of August, or that it was drawn here with
out the knowledge of the President? Was
there any reason on this evidence to which
gentlemen had hitherto confined them
selves for affirming the truth of either of
the propositions now imiOcdiately under
con si deration ?
[N. B. Ihe foregoing observations

Mr. Giles remarked, that the Secrets,.
before the function of the law
was obtained.
Mr, Fitzfimons obfervtd, on the
charg' to ihe refoliition, that as the in.
tcrclt of tiie money borrowed in Europe
is payable w here borrowed, it was econo
mical in the Secretary to interctl
with monies there,which were to be draw,,
here, and teplace the sum by taking the
amotint from the funds here destined for
that payment. A financial operation of
this nature is fituple, and saves the trouble
of drawing with the one hand, and ttmit.
ting with the other. He conceived there
was no just foundation for the firft charâ¢
Mr. Lawrance said, that when the re'
solutions calling for information from the
department were firft brought
forward, the public mind was impteffed
within idea, that there were monies un
accounted for ; this charge is now diopt
and it is honourable to the officer concern*
ed that after much probing, nothing i,
found to support it. The enquiry now is
whether a debt was paid out of this or
that fund. He did not admit the fact,
thkt it was paid out of any other monic,
than what law ftriftly warranted. He
went into a history of the business ftom i's
origin. He dated the nature and purpofts
of the loans. There was nothing to ore
vent the President, he said, to consolidate
the two loans ; provided such an arrange,
ment did not interfere with the purposes
intended by them. The President em.
ployed the Secretary to obtain the loans
under the joint authoiitv of both a&s, as
it was found that the object could belt be
carried into effect in such an arrangement.
The money thus borrowed, became fubjedt
to the apprbpriationsofboth acts, and not
exclusively for the payment of the foreign
debt. Then as part of that money was
fubjeft to be drawn here for the redemp
tion of the domestic debt, and the interest
of the loan was to be paid with domestic
funds, it wasperfeftly reafoaable to avoid
further drafts and remittances, to pay the
debt there with money there, and replace
it here with money already here. The fact
dated in the firft part of the refoliition is
by this plain (late of the cafe substantially
refuted, and appears altogether unfound
ed ; but if the fact is proved, what is im
plied ? no injury to the interests of the
community ; the intention of the legisla
ture has been in every point fulfilled. If
the Secretary had acted differently, he
would have been guilty of an absurdity,
and to blame for facrificing the public in
tt?reft and neglecting the spirit of a law,
for a strict and unprofitable observance of
its dead letter.
Mr. Giles said the tranfaftion alluded
to by the gentleman, to controvert tl e
fact laid ddwn in the firft part of the reso
lution before the committee was not im
material as they had endeavoured to (hew
it.' It was not merely a financial operati
on to avoid the neceflity of drawing and
remitting. The truth was, that the Se
cretary had drawn over near 3,000,000
of dollars. The President's authority
was limitted to 2,000,000.
Mr. Lawrance was of opinion, that if
the President, or his agent, had drawn
the whole amount of the money obtained
under both loans, he could not be said to
have gone beyond his authority. He was
authorized to borrow 12,000,000 to pay
the arrears on the foreign debt, and to
modify the whole. In the execution of
this trull he might have found it advifea
ble to draw to this country the whole of
that sum. It had been found advifeable
to draw for part, and to pay the French
by dipping produce to St. Domingo. If
the money expended soÂ»- supplies to St.
Domingo is deducted, the balance will be
found less than 2,000,000.
The committee reported progress and
obtained leave to (it to-morrow.

BALTIMORE, March 5.
ExtraEl of a Letter Jrom a .Gentleman in Philadel-
phia, dated 23 d n/t.
" The late call upon the Secretary of the
.Treasury, has served, in my opinion, to raise
his character ttill higher. How he has been
able to go over so large a Geld, in so Ihort a
space of time, to detail so many intricate ope
rations of finance ; to exhibit their depen
dence on each other ; to lhew the means by
which the credit of our country has been re
stored, and its specie increased ; and to Ihed
over the whole monied tranfaftions of four
years, at home and abroad, a light which dis
pels ambiguity, and discovers suspicion in
blulhes, is truly surprising, especially as the
call was as luddenas unexpected. I can re
collect nothing from any British Minister, iiv
all the conflicts of party, equal to it. Even
Necket*s boasted account of the finances of
Fiance, rendered to his King, is inferior ; al
though that was the result of long fludy and
elaborate preparation, and Hamilton's the
work of the moment. Poor Fellow, if he has
(1.-pt much for thele three weeks palt, I con
gratulate him upon it. I fincerelv wish that
the whole of his information could be publilh
ed in a cheap form, lo that it might be read
by every citizen of the United State, instead
of the minced pieces that mav occasionally be
served up to them by party writers. A man
of such information, exactitude, firmnefs, iu
dultrv, strength of judgment, fertility of re
source. and comprehensive views, ought to be
thoroughly known to all whom it concerns,
and may well be coniidered, by the most en
lightened, as an uncommon production ; and
yet a more unctmnui thin% would be, to fee a
sett of ambitious and difappo'iDted men, ac
quicfcing in his fqperior t-ilents and utility,
instead of laboring to drive him from a station
which the/ may polfibly covet; or moving in
323
Congress a refalution of thanks, in Head of
calumniating him in Gazettes. But has any
country given a ipecimen of such kind of am
bition*? If not, why Ihou'd the United States
let tive example ? Dutch Republicans mur
dered Wit and ate his heart. Republicans
baniflwd Arijlidcs thejuft, put Phocion to death,
and condemn-, d Socrates to As yet
we hp.ve confiiied the punilhnent of eminent
fervicesand ability to attempts to degrade
them trom office, inuendoes, ele&ioneerints
- and newspaper detra&ion : This,
however, may be only the pre ude to eating
and banishing. Let us be thankful, my friend,
that Nature has not lubje&ed you and I to
such a fate."

COMMUNiCATIO
It niu'ft afford genuine fatisfacTion to tie
public 6t' the' United States to learn, that af
ter the 'everest fcrutlify by the Repre&i ta
tives of the people into the official <otu!uÂ£t of
the Secretary of theTreafniyâit has appeal
ed uublemiHied and honorable.
There was a mistake in faying that the Se
cretary had been acquitted * because acqfi|traf
implies trial, anxJ trial prefu >poles theaccufed
party bei rig heard in his defence, which was
not the cafe in this inftante ; The chart s
brought against the Secretary were fubiv.it ted
to the House when crowded with hufinefs and
but three days before an unavoidable adjourn
ment ; and though their object and tendency
involved his removal ftom office, his ruin a id
hisdifgrace, he had no opportunity of answer
ing them or vindicating his conduct arid cha
racter. But even under this dfiadvantage,
he has been cempleatly exculpatedâand his
proceedings fulfy juftified by the Reprefenta;
tives of the nation, and fan&ioned by the ap
proving voice of many hundreds of refpesta
ble .citizens who attended the debates.
Inquiries into the conduct of public officers
are in general attended with very salutary ef
fects, and when they originate in motive 1 ;
truly patriotic and in aconvittion of* mifcoi -
du6t, they reflect credit on those who insti
tute themâat the fame time every candid
mind will allow that charges of a high nature
again ft a public officer, vested with the exe
cution of an important and delicate truit,
charges which excite alarm and diftruflr, and
threaten the national tranquility, ought to "be
preferred with caution and temperance. Any
previous fymtoms of personal diflikc or alter
cationâany long continued evidence of a
rooted disgust, or any avowed reprobation of
systems connected with the officer's stability
and reputation must in the eyes of a judicious,
â¢public, essentially detract from that merit,
which is alone due to the virtuous and dis
interested patriot, prompted only by pure re
publican principles.
* See Federal Gazette of Saturday lajl.
It is the firft principle with our government
to pay off the public debt ?s fact as the circum
ftanc.es of the people will permit. âThose who
fee the mo ft evil in a public debt, will conlefs
that it is not capable of ham when
the operation ot finking it is kept in regular p/oÂ«
grefsâTh y al'ow that much good comes out
of th's evil. One remarkable efF: Â£fc of the in
crease of our a&ive capital, is the increased price
of land â New manuf;iÂ£lures and new eriterprizes
are increasing every where. It would beagainit
reason and experience to affirm that the public
debt produces'no benefit# to the citizens at a
distance from the fear of government, and who
may not be poUcfled of the certificates. The
man who has occasion to ask creditâwho wants
to borrow or to fell, is sure to find his terms
hard when money \s scarce. On the contrary,
the increase of capital is sure in a great degree
to equalize its benefits to part ef the foci
cty âThus it is that in almost every operation
of traffic and induftty, each dtftritt of country
â¢urns to account the addition made 10 the wealth
of tiie whole.
Our party men are extremely afraid of the
government becoming corrupt. These cham
pions of virtue seem to be willing to put their
own purjty in the way of all manner of con
tamination. They consider the Frehch revo
lution as the inoft noble triumph of republican
virtueâand O ! Shame, where is thy blushâ
they dare to tell us that the ill success ot the
attempt to censure Governor Clinton's
canvaifers is an event of no less merit and
importance. The inoft audacious ast of a
party to place their favorite in the chair of
state in open contempt of their State consti
tution, is made the fubjeft of praise and ex
ultation. Such an outrage on the rights of
freemen has never happened in our country
before, and we hope it will never happen a
gainâand such an outrage on common sense
and decency as the paragraph alluded to iÂ«
hitherto equally without a fellow.

To th' amount of many thousand pounds;
Snug in the banks the treasure liesâ
A sure defence should dangers rife ;
For while 'tis hid from public view,
It mocks the grafting, fchemiiig crew;
But cunning now exerts us fpiings,
To give the dormant eagles wings ;
Hence a new banking plan is form'd,
And soon the bolted vaults are ftorm'd,
On paper plumes they mount the air,
And flyâthe Lord alone knows where;
Meantime the (harks of Speculation,
Laugh at the faqes of the Nation !

pence will be taken from the principal prize) the
CommiflTioners having agreed to preferit in re
turn a fufficient quantity of excellent free-ftoneÂ»
togeiher with the best adapted lots for the hotel
and for the out-houfes, the value of the lottery
entire may be fairly rated at something more than
p(}r: In this important instance it will be found,
on examination, to exceed all the lotteries that

perhaps in any other country. The keys of the
Hotel, when compleat, will be delivered to the
fortunate podeflor of the ticket drawn aagainfl

venient HOTEL or INN, with hot and cold
Baths, Stables, and other out houses, if presented

back avenue to the stables, &c. Se&ions and
estimates of the expense will be expected
