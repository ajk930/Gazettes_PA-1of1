FROM THE (BOSTON) COLUMBIAN CENTINEL.
Mr. RUSSELL,
IVTR- PAINE has undertaken to compare the
-L A English and French constitutions, upon the
ai ticle of reprefentacion. He ha\ of course ad
mired the latter, and censured the former.
This is unquestionably the molt defective part
of the English constitutionâbut even the uioit
ellcntial of those defedls appear to flow from the
natural order of things which a revolution in go
vernment could not reform ; from a Hate of lo
ciety, where every principle of* 1 religion or of
morality has loft itsinfluence, and where the on
ly shadow of virtue, public or private, remain
ing among a great majority of the people, is
founded upon an imaginary point of honor, the
relicfl of the exploded age of chivalry. Such at
piefent is the situation of the national character
both in England and in France. To attempt to
govern a nation like this, under the form of a
democracy, to pretend toÂ«ftabli(h overfuch be
ings a government, which according to Rousseau I
js calculated only for a republick of Gods, and
which requires the continual exercise of virtues
beyond the reach of human infirmity, even in
its belt it may poflibly be among the
dreams ot Mr. Paine, but is what even the Na
tional Aflembly have not ventured to do; their
system will avoid some of the defetfls, which the
decays ot time and the mutability of human af
fairs have introduced into that of the English,
but I do not helitate to affirm that they have de
parted much farther from theeflential principles
of popular representation ; and that however
their attachment to republican principles may
have been celebrated, die theory of their Na
tional Allembly is remote from the spirit
of democracy than the practice of the Englifb
House of Commons.
1 he grounds upon which Mr. Paine acknow
ledges his approbation of the French constitution
are that they have limitted the number of their
i eprefentatives, in proportion to the numbers of
citizens who pay a tax of 60 sous per annum, and
the duration of the aflembly to two years. It is
certainly eflential to the principles of represen
tation that there should be a frequent recurrence
to the constituent body for election, because it
is the only security of the conftitueiu for the fi
delity of the agent : It is the only practical re
fponllbility by which the representative is bound.
The term of seven years for which the House of
Commons is elected, weakens the refponlibiliry
too much, and is a proper fubjetft of constitu
tional reform ; but by the French constitution,
there is no responsibility at all; no connexion
between the representative and his constituent:
The people have not even once in seven years an
opportunity to dismiss a servant who may have
dilpleafed them, or to re-eleifl another who may
have given them fatisfatfion. 7 here is upon
the French system less dependence of the repre
sentative upon his constituent than in England,
and the mode of election renders the biennial
return of the choice almost wholly nugatory.
It is not true that the French constitution allows
he privilege of voting for a representative in
the National Aflembly to every man who pays a
tax of 6c sous per annum. Mr. Paine has mis
taken the tact, for u is impossible that he should
have intentionally misrepresented it ; though
it differs a!molt as much from his principles as
from those of a real popular representation I.
is as follows. Every Frenchman born or natu
ralized, of 25 years of age, who pays a tax equal
to three day s labour, is not a hired servant, nor
a bankrupt, nor the son of a deceased bankrupt
(a very unjufl qualification) fliall be allowed To
A ' e P re '" eilta tive to the Nati
onal Aflembly ?_By 110 means. Yet one would
think the exclusions fufficiently severe, for a Go
vernment founded upon the equal rights of ail
men ; but he fliall vote for members of a certain
aflembly : This aflembly is allowed to choose,
not the representatives of the nation, but ano
ther body of electors, who are to be the imme
diate constituents of the legislative afTembly.
Thus the supreme legislative council of the na
tion, are to be the representatives of a repre
sentative body, whose constituents are the re
prefentaiives of the people ; and at every ftae;e
ot this complicated representation, the free citi
zens ot the state, are excluded from their natu
ral rights, by additional qualifications in point.

of property.âYet this is the system which we
are told is to abolifli aristocracy.
In the formation of the legislative body, the
National Aflembly, contemplated three different
objects of representation, the perfoiu of the peo
ple, their property, and the territory which they
inhabit .- They have endeavoured to eftablifli a
proportion compounded from the three, but in
the refinement of theft- metaphysics and mathe
matics, they have loft the primary objecft itfelf,
and the people are not represented.
But setting aside their calculations, what is
the ejfential principle upon which the represent
ation of the people in the legiflalure is ground
ed ? it is, that a Freeman, /hall never be bound
by any law unless he has consented to it. It is
impossible, except in a very small slate, that eve
ry individual lhould personally give his voice,
and therefore this practice of voting by repre
sentation was invented. In its moll perf'cdt state
it cannot folly anfvier the purpose of its institu
tion, because every representative is actuated by
several powerful motives, which could not ope
rate upon his constituents. It is an artificial de
mocracy, which can never perform completely
the funiftions of the natural democracy ; but
imperfect as it always mult bÂ», no other con
trivance has been hitherto which could
so effectually give their operation to the opini
ons of the people. In the theory of representa
tion it is a personal trust, by which a thousand
individuals may authorise one man to express
their sentiments upon every law which may be
enacfled for the benefit of the whole people :
And therefore in theory every representative
ought to be elected by the unanimous vote of
his constituents ; for how can a man be said to
have been consulted in the formation of a law,
when the agent authorised to express his opinion
was not the man ofhis choice ? every pecuniary
qualification imposed either on the electors or as
a condition of eligibility, is an additional restric
tion upon the natural democracy, and weakens
the original purpose of the institution. Thus
far the people of America have submitted to ne
cefTlty in the constitution of their popular afiem
blies. But when the principle is abandoned so
completely, the individual citizen, even in
the pretended exercise of his infinitefimal frag
ment of sovereignty cannot possibly form an o
pinion, who will be the cletfor of the repre
sentative that is to be the depofirory ofhis opi
nion in the acfts of legislation. The aflembjy
thus formed may indeed afTume the name of a
democracy, but it will no more be entitled to the
appellation than an ill drawn miniature portrait,
to that of the animated original which it may
profefs to represent.
It is obvious that the reafoji why the National
Aflembly have chosen to refine their representa
tion through so many (trainers was to avoid the
violence, the tumults, the riots which render al
most all the populous towns in England a scene
of war and blood at the period of Parliamentary
-Elections. Time alone will inform us what the
success of their system will be, even in this parti
cular. Their elections however must be ex
tremely expensive, and mult open a thonfand a
venues to every fort of intrigue and venality.
The National Aflembly as a body, will be in
theory an aristocracy without refponflbility.
This aristocracy thus constituted are to podefs
the supreme power of the nation, limitted only
by a priuted constitution, fubje<ft to their own
conftrudtion and explanation.
Happy, thrice happy the people of America !
whose gentleness of manners, and habits of vir
tue are still fufficient to reconcile the enjoyment
of their natural rights, with the peace and tran
quility of their countryâwhose principles of re
ligious liberty did not result from an indiscrimi
nate contempt of all religion whatever, and
whose equal representation in their legislative
councils was founded upon an equaliry really ex
iting among them, and not upon the nietaphy
fical (peculations of fanciful politicians, vainly
contending against the unalterable courfcofe
vents, and the eltablifhed order of nature.

MR. FENNO,
' I ' HE nioft i'lgrmous authors are apt to involve themfcNf in
A contraaifliom, when they afTume principles winch aic refu
table. Th us it has happened that Mr. Paine, after laboring haid
to prove that the English nation have no conltituuon, incautiouSy
throws himfelf off his guard, and makes the following ob'ferva'-
tions : " The laws of evei y country niuft be analagous to some
common principle. In England, no parent or mailer, nor all the
authority of Parliament, omnipotent as it has called itfeif (and as
Mr. Paine himfelf has called it, for he fays it can change what in
England it called their Constitution) can bind or controul the
personal freedom even of an individual, beyond the age of twenty
one years." Admitting this alTertion to be true, whence antes
the doÂ£lrine, if not from the constitution of England ? Wt'.v can't
a parent controul the personal freedom of his foil, or a master of
his servant, after they have attained the age of twenty-one, unless
they bereftraincd by the conftitmion ? Is there any law in that
countiy which impofesfuch a restrain; ? I know of noneâperhaps
Mr. Paine does. But what is very extraordinary, why cannot
the omnipotent power of Parliament, which some writers have
said can do every thing, except make a man a woman, bind or
controul ihe personal freedom of any individual of the age of
twenty-one ? I suppose Mr. Pa ne would answer, beeaufe (he laws
of every country mufl be analagous to some common principle;
and this is a common principle in England. As I deny the truth
of this position, which is nothing more than a fanciful theory, un
wari anted by fa ft, and difptoved bv the hiflory of many coun
tries, I (hould answer, because it makes a part of the conllitution,
acknowledged from time immemorial, engrafted in the breasts of
Englishmen, and which the Parliament dare not therefore vio
late. What is meant by a common principle, to which the laws of
every country mull be analagous ? I confefs I have no clearer
conception of it than of Mr. Burke's ttnbought grace of life, which
Mr. Paine could form no idea of. I i ave no idea of a principle
paramount to the legislature of a nation, unless it be a covkitutional
principleâwhere is this common principle to be found ? Does it
exist merely in the minds of the people -or is it recorded on
parchment? Whence is it derived ? If it be found in every coun
try, then I should wi!h to enquire, what is a common principle
"1 Algiers, m Turkey, or in AbyiTinia ? Whether it is a religious
as well as a political principle in some countries, or whether it is
merely political ? Whether the despots of Asia are always re
drained by this principle in their decrees ? And whether the laws
of ever) country are ipfofatto null and void when they oppugn
this common principle > And finally, who arc to judge whether
they are null and void ? Unless these queries are fatisfaftorily an
swered, I Hull continue to believe that this tranfeendent common
principle exist* only in the imaginations of theoretical politicians.
Brit before I dismiss ihis fubjefl, I with to be informed with
what truth theaficrtion is made that the Parliament of Great-Bri
:Â»in cannot bind or controul the perform! freedom of any individual
of the age of twenty-one. The alkrtion is a very broad one. and
includts a great number of cafcs which 1 am fatisfied Mr. Paine
had not in view, viz.âthe cale of debtors, lunatics, and many
others, which mull readilv occur to persons acquainted with En
glilh jurisprudence. Believing lhat he stated or meant to Hate a
modified proposition, but at a loss totfeertain the nature and ex
tent of the modification, I beg leave to recall to his rcolleftion the
power of each house of Parliament to commit to prison thofc who
have infringed their privileges, even their own members, who of
courfc mufl be twenty-one vears of age. Now I have no other
mode of reconciling this fact with Mr. Paine's afTertion, but fuo
po.ing that imprifonmrnt in England is not binding or controll
ing one's personal freedom, as it is in other countries. To com
ment a little further upon this flrange text, what magic is there in
'he age . tuevty-one, that a parent or master, or the omnipotent
Parliament, cannot controul the personal freedom of any indivi
dual who has attained that age, but have liberty to do what they
pifale i! he wants a month ot it ? Unless this particular period of
life be definedby some conditional principle, there will be some
difficulty in deducing its origin. Why Mr. Paine's common
principle fhouid exaQly fix on the age of twenty-one as the period
of free agency, he alone can. I fancy, explain. This is certain,
that this common principle is not common to all countries, for m
fomr, majority takes place only at the age of twenty-five. I (hall
be told that the common principle of England has fixed that par
ticular age, and that the laws mufl conform thereto. Common
principle is then only another appellation for constitutional prin
ciple ; and Mr. Paine admits that England has a conllitution, but
under another name. The whole difputc is then about words.
Here is admitted by Mr. Paine to exist a certain principle, call it
what you plcafe, which the Parliament ot Great-Britain mufl con
form to. Is not this alTertion direÂ£lly inconsistent with his other
afTertion of the power of Parliament, to do what they please, un
controuled and uncontroulable, unlimited by any constitution, and
fully competent to change the form 6t government as often as their
capricc shall dittate?

AT a meeting of the General Council of tlie
Commons of Paris", 011 the 22d April 179 r, M.
de la Fayette delivered the following address :
Gentlemen,
I COME in the Commons' Hotife where foniany
agreeable remembrance'sllrike me, to acknow
ledge these lall initances of your goodness, with
all the lenlibility of ai> heart, whole firlt Â«i(li is,
after that of serving the people to be loved bj
them; and who is altonilhed at the importance
ascribed to an individual in a free counti j , where
nothing ought to be of importance but the law.
If my condatft on this occalion, gentlemen,
were to be directed only by thole sentiments
which 1 feel of tenderness and of gratitude, 1
Ihould only make reply to the regrets with which
you and the national guard have honored me,
by obeying your requeils ; but as in this business
I have listened to no personal motive, so amidst
the tumults which agitate us, it is not by the
suggestions of private feelings that 1 am to be de
termined.
I do not think that the national guard, the ma
jority of whom were ever deaf to the voice of
faction and of party, can have seen with indif
ference the cause of my difcourugementâThe
conftirutional authorities set at noughtâtheir
orders def'pifedâthe public forces oppufed tothe
execution of the law, whose defence was entrust
ed to it. We are citizens, gentleman, we are
free ; but without obedience to the law, there
remains only conftifton, anarchy, defpotifin ;
and if this capital, which has been the cradle of
the revolution, instead of ftrrrounding with its
light and its refpedt the depositories of the na
tional power, fliall besiege them- with tumults,
or fatigue them bv violence, it will cease to be
an example for Frenchmen ; it will be in danger
of becoming their terror.âEefides, gentlemen,
in the striking tokens I have received of affec
tion, too tnnch has been done for meâtoo little
for the law ; 1 have felt with the tendered emo
tion thatmy'fellow (oldiers love me ; but I have
not yet learned how far they cherish the princi
pies upon which liberty is founded.
I deposit in your hands, gentlemen. this fmeere
avowal of my sentiments; be pleal'ed to make
known to the national guard, whose tokens o(
friendlhip I have received with so much fenfibi
lit}', and to whom 1 fliall be ever a brother as af
feiftionare as grateful.
I acknowledge, to command them I warned to
b'e afl'ured that they firmly believed the fare of
the conftitntion as depending on the execution,
oftlie law, the only fovereigu of a free people ;
that the liberty of individuals, the fafety of
liotifes, religious liberty, refped: for legitimate
authority; that these, without exception, would
be held by them as facreel as by me. We not
only want courage and vigilance, but also una
nimity in the principles I have just laid down ;
and I have thought and Hill think the constitu
tion will be better served by the deliberate re
llgnation I have given in, than by my acquies
cence with the invitations with which you have
deigned to honor me.

HOW long, Sir, are we to be bored with the
idle speculations of endless writers about
(he British constitution ? Of what concern, ]
should be glad to know, is it to us, whether
Great Britain has or has not a written conflitu
tion, or whether it has certain principles in the
nature of a constitution, or whether it has only
a form of government instead of a cor ftitution?
The celebrated Mr. Burke lamented, that France
in her revolution had not more closely attended
to the British constitution ; Mr. Paine thereup
on gets in a rage, and writes a dozen pages to
prove a negative, that is, that Great Britain has
no constitution.â Publicola is displeased at this,
and infills that it has, and Brutus and Agricola
again contend that it has not. The three firft
of these writers having managed the subject
with ability, a patriot reader might peruse their
publications wijh tolerable attention, but I can
not help wishing that Agricola would attend to
his fields and his plough ; and when 1 saw the
fir 11 number of Brutus, I involuntarily exclaim
ed, Et tu, Brute ! Indeed, Mr. Printer, I dont
fee the neceliity of fluffing the newspapers day
gftei' day. morning and evening, with all these
pros cons, and 1 recommend to these
great politicians, who are so fond of writing,
to turn their thoughts and their hands to some
other i he people of England have
sense enough to take care of themselves, and if i
rhev have not, its no business of onr's. Every
body acknowledges our constitution to be a good
one, and that under it the people of the Ui7ited
States are happy and growing rich. Whar then
is the tendency of these numerous diflertatiuns
about revolutions, new constitutions, abolitions,
informations and so forth ? Tqueftion whether it
be 3 salutary one. These authors had bettet
write fomeufeful treatise on agriculture, or fug
some improvement on our domcftic manu
factures: Indeed they would, in my opinion,
render more service to society, if they were to
invent some mode of getting rid of the flies at
this troublesome season, or discover how wem ight
keep ourselves cool in this city. A. B.

having been to Long Island to fill several calks
with water ; on her return, the people feeing
unacquainted with the set of the current ill the
East River, were drifted below Governor's Is

time at south-west, and meeting the ebb tide,
railed so ihort and hollow a sea, as to founder
the boat, and leave the people adrift. Mellis.

OF JURIES.
Extract from a fpach oj judge Wilson
IT may seem, at fiift view, to be foniewhat ex
traordinary, that twelve men, untutored in the
study of juri fp. uclence, should be the ultimate
interpreters of the law, with a power to over
rule the directions of the judges, who have made
it the lubjedt of their long and elaborate re
searches, and have been raised to ilie feat of
judgment, for their profeflional abilities ati-cl
Jkill. But a deeper examination of the subject,
will reconcile us to what, at fiift, may appear
incongruous. In criminal cases, the design is,
as iias been already intimated, closely interwo
ven wjth the tranfatftion ; and the elucidation of
both depends 011 a collected view of particulars,
arising not only from the testimony, but also
from the character and conduct of the wit-nefies,
and sometimes likewise from the character and
conduct of the ptifoner. Of all thcfe the jury
are fittelt to make the 1 proper comparison and
estimate; and, therefore, it is molt eligible to
leave it to them, after receiving the direction of
the court in legal questions, to take into their
confiderarion all the circumstances of the cafe,
the intention, as well as the facts, and determine
upon the Whole, whether the conduct of the
prisoner has or has not been within the meaning
of the law.
Juries undoubtedly may make mistakesâthey
niav commit errorsâthey may commit grols ones
âbur, changed as tliey conltantly are,' their er
rois and miltakes can never grow into a dange-
system : The native uprightness of their
sentiments will not be bent under tlie weight <U
precedent and authority. Befidrs, their mil
takes and their errors, except the venial ones on
the fide of mercy, made by travcrfe juries, are
not without rediefs.

in reality were either accomplished by the fpiric
of the people, or the blunders and mistakes of

1 he disappointed envy ant! malice of some

in anv occasions,- but it was hardly to have been
expected, that they would have blundered oil lo
palpable a misrepresentation as the above, This'
is truly a modern discovery. There is Hot an in

was efFeified thro the wjfdom of those plans which

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven ; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful situation is not furpaflcd, if equalled by any ; be

to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by reaion of the flats, this wharf is necessarily extended to the
channel, where ships can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the most extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3-4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all claflfes of people, for
