Observations en the I.eilcrrtf " A F* it
Addrejfed to the YeomwryaJ. the United
AN idea has been circulated, that Congrcjs
have granted exemptions, privileges and
bounties to the New-Jersey Shitty for promoting
t'feful manujadures, and parts of the letters of
" The Farmer" tend Co confirm that mistake.
The freemen of the United States will find, how
ever, on the ftrifteft examination, that no vote,
refolutiou or act, of the federal legi.lature, has
been parted concerning that company, and of
course that no bounty, privilege, exemption or
other advantage has been given by Congress to
them, their workmen or their property, of any
fort or kind. They are indifputab'y liable to
the impolt, tonnage, duty on distilled spirits,
and every other revenue of the United States,
present or future, in like manner and in equal
proportion with any other citizen or owner of
property. They have no direst or indirect ad
vantage under the acts of Congress, but what
every citizen has, who inclines to pursue the
branches they may carry on. It is therefore
tin high duty to the people to undeceive them in a
matter, which might give them discontentment
with a government, under which they are tail
ing a degree of prosperity never before enjoyed
by them, or any other nation.
The whole of the advantages enjoyed by the
New-Jersey manufacturing company are under
a law of that State. This art has exempted
their workmen from military duty, except in
cases of invasion or imminent danger ; but this
will not avail them in the fmallejl degree, because
it exempts only from calls under the laws of
the State, which are now annulled by the mili
tia art of Congress. From militia duty they
are not nor can they be exempted by the legisla
ture of New-Jersey ; and the law of the United
States requires the fame militia services, du
ties, fines, &rc. from each of the New-Jersey
Society and its workmen, as from any other ci
tizen or manufartnrer.
The company have powers relative to canals
and inland navigation, similar to those of the
Sufquehannah and Schuylkill canal companies,
in Pennsylvania, and the Hudson and Mohawk
river companies, in New-York. Corporations
for inland navigation exist also in New-England,
Maryland, Virginia, North and South-Carolina,
though it should seem that " The Farmer's"
objections to this kind of alTbciation is such,
that it is doubtful whether he would confeut to
â¬ corporation for making a turnpike road, or an
inland navigation, or a religious society or a
public school. The yeomanry of the United
States, however, it is presumed have no such
fanciful objections to these common and neces
sary means of obtaining such desirable and ufe
ful objerts. We have city, town, and borough
corporations in Pennsylvania, and in all the
States, with civil powers to preserve the peace
and order of the focietv, and the health of the
people, and to facilitate the settlement of ac- ]
counts and debts in places where there is ufual-1
ly some dealing and trade. Burlington, Amboy,
Elizabeth-town and Brunfwick, in New- Jersey,
being so incorporated, the legislature of that
State appear to have thought it no great favor
to provide for the eftablifhme/it of the diftrirt
which (hould become the principal feat of the
pianufartory in the fame manner, but probably
deemed it, as it really appears, highly expedient.
It seems to be very wife to have a well regu
lated police in a place where there will be ma
sy ft rangers. The aflembly of New-Jersey
have exhibited a cautious delicacy, worthy of
the legislators of a free and intelligent people,
in exprefly providing, that the place or diftrirt
lha!l not become incorporated, if a majority of
the taxable inhabitants thereof (hall fignify to
the Governor their disTent from, or disapproba
tion of the incorporationâSo that if, on ma
ture deliberation, rhcy do not like the powers
of the incorporation, or if they are, on general
principles, again ft any fort of incorporation,
they have ample power to prevent it. Thi c ,
fellow citizens, is the law which 4< The Far
mer" tells you u grants to a few wealthy men
the exclufivt jurifdirtion of fix miles square, and
a variety of unconstitutional privileges." It ic
not a few wealthy men, but all the taxable inhab
itants, who are to be incorporated, and nearly
all of the principal owners of the stock of the
company artually re fide in other town (hips,
counties and States, and a few in foreign coun
tries ; and not being 44 inhabitants" cannot be
members of the territorial corporation, which
is to pofTefs the civil powers. Besides it reallv
is not true, that they a*ie to have 44 cxduf.vt"
jurifdirtion, for they are as much under the
controul of the legislature, the Governor, and
the judiciary of tiie State and of the government
as the United States, as any otSier city or cor
porate town, or any county or .village in New-
Jersey. It is not neceifary to comment upon
the indecorum and abuse for art, design, crimi
nal itvf folly, and breach of duty, which 44 The
Farmer 1 ' bestows upon the government of
N-w- jersey, the Secretary of the Treasury,
and the company, in the very page wherein he
thus amply miflakes and misrepresents their
proceedings. Ke fpeaksof danger from a capi
tal stock of Â£. 140,000 sterling in the hands of a
great number of persons, when there are and
have been these thirty years several individuals
in the United States, who are each worth as
great a sum. This stock is owned by manufac
turers from abroad, who are employed by the
company, by farmers, merchants, lawyers,
physicians, women, minors, landed men, and
monied men, members of the general govern
ment, officers of the State of New-Jerfev, ci
tizens of various States, and foreigners relident
here and in other countries. Can it be expect
ed, that combinations and devices dangerous to
liberty or honest induitry can take place in so
mixed a society or can it be fuppoled, that such
perversions of the countenance of a State will
be permitted to exist a single month.
The legislature of New-Jersey have exempt
ed the workmen from their State poll-taxes,
upon their persons and occupations ; but it
is not likely that such exemption will be of
any value, because poll taxes are so generally
diiapproved that they are always made very
light in this country, and are seldom or never
imposed on any but single men, and taxes on
occupations are a very trivial part of the re
sources of any State, and the exemption will be
of little avail, because Congress will lay the
principal taxes and they have not given any ex
emption. The great taxes of all known coun
tries are consumption duties, custom-house du
ties and the land tax. All these the workmen
will have to pay, whether laid by the State or
by the United States. But as the finances of
New-Jersey are in a very good situation and dai
ly improving, and it is a State of great ceconomy
in its public expences, its legislature will have
very little occasion to collert money from the
people. The federal customs, duties and taxes
are thole which the citizens of New-Jersey will
principally have to pay, and the workmen, raw
materials, manufartures, lands and tenements
of the workmen and of the company will be as
liable to those customs, duties and taxes as if
the exemption had not been made by the State.
For it is plain that a State art cannot exempt
from taxes of any kind due to the general go-
vernment.
[To be concluded in our next.]
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES,
Mr. Fenno,
IT is true that men have degenerated from what
the ancients were. But one is led to believe,
from the resemblance of temper and condurt dis
covered among certain writers agarnft our govern
ment, that the Athenian blood is not yet all run
out.
The best republics of ancient times were ruined
hy the ambition of men who ftudicd the moll re
fined arts, and pra&ifed the vilest means to krep
the multitude restless and inflamed. Men poflcfT
ing the powers of oratory to govern the aflemblies
of i he people, were jealous of their own authority.
They haled those whom genius made their com
petitors, and merit and virtue their superiors.â
Impatient for honors and employments, of which j
they were unwoithy, they aflumed the office of i
censors on those who poflefled them. Not having
nor being entitled to gain the public confidence,:
they made it their inceflant care to deflroy it j
where it was placed. By arts, alwavs odious,
but always formidable, they inflamed intestine dif
fentions; they diflemmated suspicious and fright
ful tales through ihe state. They had againfl
them, indeed, the severity of the laws, and the
contempt of all good men : but in their favor they
had the pretext of public good, so often made
an instrument >n the hands of ambition and party
enmity; and they had also, what was of ft ill more
avail to obtain their ends, their effrontery and
their insolence. No city had more glory than
Athensâno citizens enjoyed less tranquillityâ
none had wiser laws or less regarded themânone
produced more great men or better citizens : yet
none murdered more reputations, or spilt more of
the blood of heroes than Athens. O city ! not
less renowned for tumult than for genius, while we
weep and wonder over thy ruins, may we learn
this inftruftion, th?r even wile and equal laws, un
less flrirtly and ftradily enforced, incite faftiom
to a fiercer aniinofny, and arm them with more
deadly weapons. B.

French people, flill less ro ditftate
laws to them ; and that they are on

ing overthrown the empire, threaten
the general fafery of all Europe to
gether.â 2flly. That they enter into
France only to facilitate to the King
the free exercise of his lawful autho
rity, and the means of concerting with
the French pation themeafures which
circumstances, and the return of tran
125
quiliry make necefl'ary.â3d!y. They

PARIS, July 16
On the Federation day a circuni
ftance took place while the King was
at the Military School,which is known ,
to very few bat those present. About
1200 national grenadiers, who formed
the escort of the royal family to and
from the Thuilleries, being aflembled
in the court of the military school,
oneof them addrelling his brother sol
diers, told them there was a probabi
lity that some evil ininded pcrfons
might make an attempt upon the
King, he invited them all to swear
mutually to defend their King till
the lafl moment ; the suggestion ope
rated like the ele<ftric spark, they all
to s man knelt down, and with their
, hands uplifted, called to heaven to
witness their oath ; to which they
evei added, that in cafe of any fu
ture danger, they fhouldall repair to
the palace as the common rendezvous,
and make a rampart of their bodies
before their sovereign.âThe officer
of the guard informed the King of
this tranfa&ion ; his majesty descend
ed from the falloon to the court yard ;
the tears flood in his eyes ; he could
fay no more than, "My children !
My brave comrades !" He palled a
long the ranks shaking hands with
the foremoft men. An exprtiffive si
lence terminated this affeiXing scene!
The grenadiers kept their word :
when the King joined the National
Aflembly, to ascend the altar, they
formed a line three deep on each fide,
and, contrary to order, even ascended
the altar with the King ; in vain the
federifts and pikemen â¢itteniptedi to
enter their ranks, claiming equally
the fame honor of approaching their
hereditary representative ; their only
answer was, " the King is confined
to our care ; you cannot pass ;âa se
cond, but ineffectual, attempt was
made to fore etheguard, and toafcend
the altar ; they continued firm, and
never quitted the King until they had
left him fafe in the Thuilleries.
I must mention to you another fact ;
during the reading the oath, the King
kept his usual tone of voice, but when
he came towards the end, he fixed his
eyes on M. Petion, and raising his
voice, spoke these words, so as to be
heard at an immense distance, " Je
Jure de faire refpeifier la Loi*." The
cries of Vive la NationâVive le Roi,
were on the instant, and indiscrimi
nately, utrered by every fpedtatur.
* I swear to make the law refpe&ed.
O S T E N D, August 3
Manifesto, fnblijhsd at Brajjeli the
28tb July, 1792, given by the Duke
of Brunswick, Commander in Chief
oj the Austrian and Vruffian Armies.
THEIR Majesties the Emperor and
King of Pruflia, having confided to
me the command of the combined ar
mies which they have caused to be
assembled on the frontiers ofFrance ;
I have refolvrd to announce to the
inhabitants of that kingdom, the mo
tives that have induced these two so
vereigns to this Hep, and the princi
ples by which they are governed there
in.
After having arbitrarily ftipprefl'ed
the rights and prerenfions of che Ger
man Princes in Alsace and Lorraine,
and overset a!l inierior order and
good government ; exercised against
the sacred person of the King and his
augult family, innumerable injuries
and violences, continued from day to
day, and constantly renewed. Those
who have usurped the reins ofgovern
ment have, at length, filled up the!
their iniquities in causing
[Whole No. 554.]
an unjust war to be declared against
his imperial Majelly, and in attack
ing his provinces, fituatedin the Low
Countries. Some of the polil-fiions of
the Germanic empire have been in
volved in this invasion, and others
have elcaped, only by fubniitring to
the imperious menaces of the predo
minating fadtioi!, and of its einiiia-
ries
His Majesty the King of Prufiia, u
niting with his Imperial Majelty, by
the ties of a ftritft and defenlive alli
ance, as well as in his quality of pre
ponderating member of the Gerina
nick body, has not been able to re
fufe marching to the succour of hi*
ally, and co-estates ; and it is in both
these qualities, that he takes upon
hiinfelf the defencc of that monarch
and of Germany.
To these two interests is unired a
nother equally important anil which
the two lovercigiis have much at heart
â¢ âthac of causing the anarchy existing
in the interior of France to cease, to
itay the allaults made upon tlie throne
and the altar ; to ie-eltabli<b the le
gal authority ; to restore to the king
the liberty and fafety of which he
has been deprived, and to place him
in a Htuation to exercise the legiti
mate authority that of right belongs
to him.
Convinced that the found part of
the nation abhors the excefles of a
faction that subdues it, and that the
greater number of the inhabitants
wait with impatience the moment of
auxiliary aid openly to.declare theni
felves against their odious oppreflors,
his inajetly the einperor, and his roa
jelty the king of Prussia, call upon
and invite them to return without de
lay to the paths of reason, of justice,
of order, and of peace these
views the undersigned general and
commander in chief of the two armies
declares as follows.
ift. i hat, led into tills war by ir
refiltable motives, the two courts pro
pole to thenifelves no other objects
than the good of France, without in
tending to enrich thenifelves by means
of their conquelts.
2d. That they do not intend to in
termeddle in the interior affairs of
France, but mean only to deliver the
king, the queen, and the royal fami
ly troin their captivity, and to pro
cure to his mod chriltian majelly the
neceflary security that the king may
be enabled without danger or obsta
cle to call together such convocation
or aflembly as he may think proper,
to alfift in preserving that happiness
to his subjects, which he has promised
them, and to which he will contribute
all that may depend upon him.
3d. The combined armies will pro
tect all cities, burghs, villages, per
sons, and pofleffions, that shall submit
to the king, and they will instantane
ously contribute to the lettering of
order, and a good police throughout
all France.
4th. The National Guard are call
ed upon proviftonally, to watch over
the tranquility of the country, to the
fafety of the persons and effetfis of all
French citizens, until the arrival of
the troops of their imperial and roy
al majesties, or until it (ball be other
ways ordered under pain of being
held personally rel'ponfibleâOn the
other hand, such of the national
guards as lhall have fought against
(lie troops of the allied courts, and
(hall be taken arms in hand, shall be
treated as enemies, and puni/hed as
rebels to their king and as disturbers
of the public peace.
sth. That the general offieers, su
balterns and soldiers of the troops of
the French line are equally called
upon to return to their ancient feal
ty, and inltantly to submit to the
king their lawful sovereign.
6th. That the members of the de
partments, the diftridt* and municipalities and held equally responsible
on their heads, and with all their
goods and chattels for all crimes,fires,
murders or atrocious that they
may not have used all their endeavors
to prevent within their jurifdidtion :
they are further held provilionally to
continue their functions until his
Molt Christian Majeity fliall be placed
at full liberty to provide ultimately,
or at lead until in his name other
Heps (hall be taken in the interval.
7th. The inhabitants of all cities,
boroughs and villages that lhall dare
to defend themfelven againlt the ar
mies of (heir Imperial and Royal Ma
jellies, or to fire upon them either in
the open field or from any windows,
doors, or openings of their houses,
shall be immediately punished accord
ing to the rigour of the martial law,
and their houses shall be demolished
or burned ; on the contrary, all in
habitants of the said cities, burghs,
or villages, who shall hallen to lub
mit to the king,, by opening their
doors to the troops of their majesties,
shall be instantly placed under their
protection, their persons and effects
shall remain under the fafeguard of
the laws, and care shall be taken to
provide for the security of all and
each one of them.
Bth. The city of Paris and all its
inhabitants without diftintftion, are
held tofubmit immediately, and with
out delay, to the King ; to set the
King at full and entire liberty ; and
to afl'ure to him as well as to the Roy
al Family, that inviolability and ref
pert which fubjedis owe to their fo
vereigu by all the laws of nature and
of nations. Their Imperial and Roy
al Majesties render personally respon
sible of all events upon their heads,
and to be tried in a summary milita
ry way, without the least hope of
pardon, all members of the National
Assembly, the department, the dif
tric I }, the municipality, and the Na
tional guard of Paris, jultices of the
peace, and all others to whom it may
belong. Their said Majesties declar
ing, on the faith and word of an Em
peror and a King, that if thecaftie of
the Thuilleries is either forced or in
fulted ;âthat if the least violenceâ
the least outrage be offered to his
thajefty, the queen, or the royal fa
milyâif immediate measures be not
taken for their l'afety, their prefet
vation, and their liberty, that they
will take an exemplary and ever me
morable vengeance by delivering over
the city of Paris to military execution
and a total subversion, while the guil
ty revolters are receiving the punish
ment they will have merited.
Their imperial and royal majesties
On the contrary protnife to the in
habitants of the city of Paris, that
they will use their good offices with
his mod Christian majesty, to obtain
pardon of all wrongs and errors that
may have been heretofore done, and
to take the moll rigorous measures
to enfuie their persons and effecfts, if
they immediately and exadtly obey
the present injunction.
Finally their Majesties being una
ble to acknowledge any laws as ex
isting in France except such as shall
emanate from the King, enjoying a
perfect liberty, they protest' before
hlSnd against the authenticity of any
declarations which may be made in
the name of his most Christian majes
ty, as long as his sacred person, that
of the queen, and the royal family
shall not be really in fafety In con
sequence their imperial and royal ma
jesties invite and eameftly folici't his
most Christian Majesty to name a eity
in his kingdom the most near to the
frontiers into which he maybe pleas
ed to retire with his Queen and fa
mily under a strong and fuflicient es
cort which shall be lent for that pur
pose, in order that his most christian
majesty may call together the minis
ters and counlellors he may think
proper ; or colledl such convocation
or aflembly as may appear best to him,
to provide for the 1 eltoraiion of good
order by the regular interior admin
-illration of his kingdom.
In a word, I do further declare and
engage myfelf in my own name, and
in my quality above mentioned, to
occaiion to be every where observed
by the troops entrusted to my com
mand, a good and exaift discipline,
promising to treat with mildness and
jnoderation all well inteniioned /"ob
jects that may appear peaceable and
submissive, and to apply force enly
againlt inch as shall be guilty cf re
filtance or ill will.
It is forthefe reafonsthat I require
and exhortall inhabitants of t he king
dom in the ftrongefl and nioft eaniell
manner, not to oppose the march 1 and
operations of the troops that 1 com
mand, but rather to allow thfin free
paflage and all ftichgood will and ai
(illatice as circum dances may require.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
TO ARISTIDES.
THE " American" to confirm the inference
resulting from the official connexion be
tween the Secretary of State and the Editorof the
National Gazette,appeals to a conformity of the
political principles and views of that officer with
those which are sedulously inculcated in that
Gazette. If this conformity exists, it certainly
affords a strong presumption, in aid of iireft
fa&s, of the operation of his influence or the
complexion of that paper.
The circumstances of conformity allelged,
fall under two head 1 ;; one, That the Secretary
of State was in the origin opposed to thatCon
ftitntion, which it is the evident object 01 the
National Gazette to discredit: the other, That
he has been, and is opposed to thore measures
â which it is the unremited, and it may be laid
the avowed endeavor of that paper to censure
and subvert.
lit contradiction to the firft fuggeflion, Afif
tides cites an authority, which the American ap
pears to have relied upon in support of his afler
tion ; the speech of Mr. Pendleton in the con
vention of Virginia. Let an analysis of this
speech fliew whether it fuppoi ts or contradicts
the aiTertion.
Mr. Pendleton represents a certain letter of
Mr. Jefferfon as containing these particularsâ
a strong v/ilh that the firji nine convcntioni may
accept the new constitution because it would
secure the good it contains, which is great and
important. 2d. A wi(h that-the four latest which
ever they lhould be, might refufe to accede to
it till amendments were fecurei. 3d, A caution to
take care that noobje<stion tothe form of the go
vernment (hould produce a schism in the union;
which Mr. Jeiferfon admits to be an incurable
evil.
From this it appears, that, though Mr. Jeff
erfon was of opinion, that the constitution con
tained " great and important good", and was
desirous that the firft nine deliberating States
fhouid consent to it for the fake of preserving
the existence of the union ; yet he had strong
objections to the constitution ; so strong that he
was willing to rilque an ultimate dtjmembement in
an experiment to obtain the alterations which
lie deemed neceffarv.
It the four last deliberating States (particular
ly if they had happened to be States in geographi
cal contiguity, which was very poflible) had re
futed to ratify the constitution, what might not
have been the consequence ? Who knows whe
ther the afTenting States would have been will
ing to have been coerced into the amendments
which the non-aflenting States might have been
disposed to dictate > Calculating the intrigues
and machinations which were to have been ex
pefted to stand in the way, who can fay, if even
two thirds of both houses of CongreVs fliould
have been found willing to propose, that three
fourths of the legislatures, or conventions, in
three fourths of the States would have been
brought to adopt the required amendments ?
Could anything but obje&ions to the constitu
tion of the most feneus kind have iuftified the
hazarding an eventual schism in the union, in
.0 great a degree as would have attended an ad
herence to the advice given by Mr. Jefferfon ?
Can there be any perversion of'truth in affirm
ing, that the person who entertained thole ob
jections was opposed to the constitution !
The opposition which was experienced in
every part of the United States, acknowledged
the necessity and utility of the uniou; and, G
enerally fpeaking,that she constitution contained
many valuable features; contending onlv that
it wanted some eflential alterations to render
it upon the whole a fafe and a good government.
It may be fatisfaftory to review what was
aid 111 the fame convention of Virginia bvfome

argued fmcerely from his impreinon of the true
import of the letter, or made an attempt " tc
pervert Mr. Jefferfon's sentiments," as Arif
tides allinns, must be reserved to his own con
sciousness, and to the candid coultrudtion of an
impartial public.
Mr. Msdifon, in reply to Mr. Henry (p. 122
of the fame debates) expreUes himfelf thusâ
" The honorable member, in order to influence
our deciiion, has mentioned the opinion of a ci
tizen, who is an ornament to this itate. When
the name of this diftinguifhecl charatier was in
troduced, I was much surprised. hit come to
this then, that we are not to joilow our own reason ?â
Is it proper to adduce the opinions of retpetta
hle men, not within these walls ? If the opinion
of an important character were to weigh on
this occasion, could we not adduce a character
equally great on our fide ? Are we who (in the
honorable gentleman's opinion) are not to be
guided by an erring world, now to submit to the
opinion of a citizen beyond the Atlantic f I believe
that were that gentleman now on this floor, he
would be for the adoption of this constitution.
Iwifhhis name had never been mentionedâ
I wish every thing spoken here relative to his
opinion, may be iupprefled, if - our debates
Ihould be publiflied. I know that the delicacy
of his feelings will be wounded, when he will fee
in print what bas, and may be )aul concerning
him on this occasion. I am in some measure
acquainted with his sentiments on this subject.
It is not right for me to unfold what he has informed
me. But I will venture to assert that the clause
now difculled is notobjefted to by Mr. Jefferfon.
He approves of it, because it enables the govern
ment to carry on its operations, &c."
It is observable that Mr. Madison neither
advocates the accuracy of Mr. Pendleton's com
ment, nor denies the justness of that ot Mr.
HenryâHis solicitude appears to be to destroy
the influence of what he impliedly admits to be
the opinion of Mr. Jeferfon, to prefsout of fight
the authority of that opinion, and to get rid of
the lu'ijeet as fa ft as poflible. He confeffes a
knowledge of Mr. Jefferfon's sentiments, but
prudently avoids disclosure ; wrapping the mat
ter in mysterious reserve ; and leaving the pub
lic to this day to conjecture what was the pre
cise import of the sentiments communicated.
Enough however is seen to juftify the conclusi
on, that if the spirit of Mr. Jefferfon's advice
had prevailed with the convention, and full cre
dence had been given to the expected adoption
by New HampshireâVirgipia,NorthCarolina,
New-York and Fihode-Iftand wjuld have tem
porarily thrown themselves out of the Union.
And whether in that event, they would hane been
at this day reunited to it, or whether there
would be now any union at all is happiiy a spe
culation which need only be pursued to derive
the pleafmg reflection, that the danger was wife
lv avoided.
To understand more accurately what the
American meant in aflerting that Mr. Jefferfon
had been opposed to the constitution, let him
be Compared with himlelf. 11l his hvft paper
he exprefles himfelf thusâ" While the consti
tution of the United States was depending be
fore the people of this country for their consi
deration and decision, Mr. Jefferfon being in
France was oppoftd to it, in rone of tts ntoji impor
tant features, and wrote his objections to iome
of his friends in Virginia. He atJitJl went so
far as to discountenance its adoption : thoug he af
terwards recommended it on the ground of expedi
ency in certain contingencies."
From this, it is evident, that so far from de
nying, he has even admitted, that M. Jefferfon,
at onefiage of the bufmefs, recommended the adop
tion of the constitution to his JJlqzv citizens, but
upon a contingency. And this is literally the
fa&, as established by the letter quoted in the
debates of the convention- The advice is to a
dopt if nine dates had not previoully adopted;
to reje<st, if number of states had previous
ly adopted. This is clearly to adopt, or not,
upon a contingency. Thus the authority ap
pealed to by Aiijlides confirms the latter part of
the American's allertion, without contradi&ing
the former part of it.
Arijlides Las not denied, nor do I believe he
will denyâThat Mr. Jeiferfon in his early com
munications discountenanced the adoption of
the conilitution in its primitve form. I know
the source of the American*s information. It is
equally authentic and friendly to Mr. Jefferfon-
Allowing for the bare pofiibility of mifapprehen.
fion, it exattly accords with the statement
which has been made of it. If the fa<st fliall be
denied, the source of information will be indi
cated, under due guards for the delicacy of the
proceeding.
This will serve, either to confirm, or, in cafe
of mi (conception, to corre&.
I add that some of* Mr. Jefferfon's objections
to the constitution have not been removed by
the amendments which have been proposedâ
Part of his objections went to the flru&ure oi
particular parts of the government.
As to the fccond fart with which the American
corroborates the charge of Mr. Jefferlon's par
ticipation in the views of the National Gazette,
it is in a degree conceded by Arijiidcs. He con
feffes, nay he even boajls Mr. Jefferfon's abhor
rence of some of the leading principles of Mr.
Hamilton's fifcal administrationâthat is, the
leading principles of those mea'fures which have
provided for the public debt and restored public
credit.
It would have been well, if Ariflides had told
us what those leading principles are, which are
the obje<sts of so much abhorrence to Mr. Tef
ferfon.
The leading principles of Mr. Hamilton's
fifcal administration have beenâthat the public
debt ought to be provided for, in favor of thole
who, according to the exprels terms of the con
trad, were the true legal proprietors of it;
that it ought to be provided for, in other re
peats, according to the terms of the

To give an idea of the accuracy with which
Arijlides difcloles Mr. Jeiferfon's opinions I foil
c ite one of his phrases with a (hort observation
He aflerts that a suggestion against Mr. | t fel
ion, which he states, is made on no better fono.
dation than his being opposed to_/Â» Â£ of the prin"
ciples of the funding system, of the national
bank, and of certain other measures ofthe Se
cretary ofthe Treafory. It is matter of gene
(ral notoriety, and unquestionable certair.tv
that Mr. Jefferfon has been opposed to tie u'
tional bank in totj, to its conjiitulionahi, arid it
its expediency. With what propriety is it tiiei
said that he has been opposed only to "Jem c
the principles of that institution."
I proceed scow to state the exact tenor ofrtÂ»
advice which Mr. Jefferfon gave to Conjpdsie.
fpedting the transfer of the debt djqe tofooi
to a company of Hollanders. 'After mental.,
an offer which had been made byf'ucbacorapuj'
for the purchase of the debt, he concludes wist
these extraordinary expreffonsâ" If there isi

This letter was the fubjeft of a '

treated the idea of the transfer proposed ai I*)#'
unjust and impolitic: vnjujl, becauie tlie natiajr
would contract an engagement whichthert
110 well grounded profpeft of fulfilling;
because a failure itt the payment of intertft,ojj
the debt transierred (which was itmlalk)vi&t'
bhjl all hopes of credit with the citizens
the United Netherlands, in future pressing
gencies of the Union : And gave it as their epij
nion, that it would be advisable fÂ»r Congrdi,
ivit/wut delay, to inllruft their Miniver at tli
Court of France, to forbear giving his faoAiif
to any such transfer.â
Congress agreeing in the ideas of the board,
caused an inftrudtion to that effect to be sent
to Mr. Jeflferfon*. Here then was afoleran ast
of government condemning the principle as unÂ«
just and impolitic.

I Here is no complicated problem which fop.iif
try may entangle or obscure. Here is a plain
queflion of moral feeling. A government is en
couraged on the express condition of MhaMg' l
projpett of making a due provision for a debt
which it owes, to concur in a transfer oj t a
debt from a nation well abie to bear the incon

P. S. Some additional observations are re

Philadelphia, Sept. 19.
the latest INTELLIGENCE from FRANCE.
Friday last th? (hip Ohio, Capt. Kemp,arrived
at New-York iti Jo days from Bristol. By this
veiTel London papers are received to the I fth
August. We have room only for an abflrafl:
of the intereliing information they contain.
Augvjl I. The President of the National
Alfembly informed that body that he had re
ceived by poll the declaration ilTued in the name
of the Duke of Brunfwick.âThe Aflembly de
creed by acclamation, " That if the laws of
war are not ftrietly observed, in regard to all
Frenchmen taken with arms in their hands, all
the officers belonging to the enemy, who may
be made prisoners, shall experience a fnnilar
treatment, whatever may be their rank, titles
or diftinftions."
A letter was fentby the King to the Aflembly,
relative to the Manifeftoâin which he fays that
it exhibits nothing that can be considered as a
proof of its authenticity. He calls on the na
tion to be unitedâand profeffes in the warmest
terms his determination to support the C.onfti
tution, Independence and Liberty of France. â
This letter being read in the AfTembly, a mo
tion was made that it should be printed and sent
to the 83 departments. On this motion, the
previous question was called.â u M. Iznaid,
having with difficulty obtained a hearing, said
that the Kind's letter contained only a heap of
falfhoods." The proposal of printing the letter
was rejected.
Augvjl 4. The Envoys of the Commonalty
of Paris, with M. Petion at their head, appeared
at the bar, and M. Petion demanded in the name
of the 48 fe&ions, that the King should be ex
eluded from the Throne, and that the manage
ment of affairs during the interregnum, should
be entrusted to responsible Ministers, until the
of a new King in a National Conven
tionâ-M. Petion said the King has always shewn
himfelf an enimy to the people, an enemy to the laws,
and an enemi to France. This excited a violent
agitation in the Aflembly. Several members
dei]red to be heard, but the tumult rendered it
impossible, and the President put an end to the
fitting without any vote being come to upon it.
The Aflembly have passed a decree, in which
fueh temptations are thrown out to induce the
Auftrians and PrufTians to desert their colours,
as it is thought will desolate their armies as soon
as they pitch their tents in France.-âThe Duke
of Brunfwick was expected to march on or be
fore the firft of August.âA letter from Paris,
dated 4th Aug. in an English paper, has |his
palTageâ u I will not fay that in this fever of
republicanism, the King may riot be declared to
have forfeited his crown ; but I am sure that
republicanism will not endure for a week. 1
hope, however, that they will avoid the dread
ful evil of suspending the King, as I am sure
the fame effect would disband their army."â
Such was the state of things on the 4th August.
About the 28th July the Auftrians made ar.
attack on the French army at Mauldeâthe
French advance Guard consisting of 6000 men
was attacked by 10,000 ; the Auftrians yielded
the fieldâthey loft 200 men, and great part of
their baggageâ and had it not been for the
treachery of two Colonels who deserted, the
vi&ory of the French would have been complete.
M. La Fayette was well, at the head of his ar
my the 28th July.
M. Luckner in a letter to the National AfTem
bly, has expressly denied that he ever acculed
M. La Fayette of an intention to march against
Paris. M. La Fayette in another letter fays,
that such an accusation u is not true"
M. Montefquiou, commander of pne of the
French armies on the Frontiers, has resigned.â
M. Luckner, while at Paris, gave a most de
grading account of the grand armies of France
in refpeft to their numbers and equipments. â
The King of Denmark being invited by the
Kings of Hungary and Pruflia to join the confe
deracy again# France, has declined to accept
of the invitation. Among other observation
in his answer, he r ays, u Denmark has acknow
ledged, as well as the dcccafed Emperor of the
King of Pruflia, the confHtution of France,
since Louis XVlth. has solemnly avowed it."â
The celebrated Paul Jones, it is laid, died in
the utmost povertyâit has been conje&urec
that this was owing to his favoring the anti
revolution party in Paris.
The New-Brunfwick Gazette fays, notwith
standing the many discouraging accounts so fre
quently publllhed from the "VVeftward, the re
cusing business goes on very well. It is con
jectured by some that peace will overtake us
sooner than many imagine.
In the fli'p Amelia, Hill, from London, ar
rived John Penn, E r q. and his Lady; Andrew
Allen, Esq. with his four daughters and three
sons; together with the domestics of both fami
lies making 24 paflengers.
TI eDafliwood Packet from England brought
a Diploma from the University of Edinburgh,
conferring the Degree of Doctor of Laws on the
Hon. John Jay, Chief Justice of tlie United
States.

/would be highly becoming in the people of the
I United State*:, to join as with one voice, in t
a:iy of thanksgiving tot/re Supreme , for the mer
cies he has so abundantly bellowed on them,
of peace and general frefperity ; and to implore,
that he may avert the evils which are meditated
iytht Despots of Europe, against their fellow men,
of the French and Pohjli nations, and that these
pefpots and all mankind, may be convinced in
Uae time, of their folly and wickedness.
