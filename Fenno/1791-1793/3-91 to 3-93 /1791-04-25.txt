(concluded.)
NARROW and illiberal sentiments are not
peculiar to the rich or the poor. If the
vulgar have found a Machiavel to give counte
nance to their malignity, by his contracted and
illiberal exclamations againlt illustrious families,
as the curse of heaven : the rich and the noble
have not unfrequently produced fordid inltances
of individuals amongthemfelves, who have adopt
ed and propagated an opinion that God hates the
poor, and that poverty and misery on earth are
infli&ed by Providence in its wrath and displea
sure. This noble philofopliy is surely as shallow
and as execrable as the other Plebeian philolb
phy of Machiavel ; but it is countenanced by at
leift as many of the phenomena of the world.
Let both be discarded as the reproach of human
understanding, and a disgrace to human nature.
Let the rich and the poor unite in the bands of
mutual affection, be mutually sensible of each
others ignorance, weakness and error, and unite
in concerting measures for their mutual defence,
against each other's views and follies,by support
ing an impartial Mediator.
That ingenious Genevan, to whom the English
nation is indebted for a more intelligible expla
nation of tlieir own constitution than any that
has been ever publilhed by their own Aclierly or
Bacon, Bolingbroke or Blackllone, has quoted
this paflage of Machiavel, and applied it, like
him, to the dishonour of republican governments.
De Loltne, in his constitution of England, Book 2.
c. 1. faysâ" 1 cannot avoid tranferibing a part of
" the speech which a citizen of Florence add relied
" once to the Senate : the reader will find in it a
" kindofabridgedftoryofall republics." Ilethen
quotes the passage before cited from Machiavel.
Why should so grave an accusation be brought
againtt republics ? If it were well founded, it
would be a very serious argument against such
forms of government: but it is not. Thediflen
tions of families are not the effect of republican
government, but of human nature. They are
the unavoidable consequence of that emulation,
which God and nature have implanted in the hu
man heart, for the wisest and be!f purposes, and
which the public good, instead of cooling or ex
tinguifliing, requires to be directed to honour
and virtue, and then nourilhed, cheriftied, and
cultivated. If such contentions appeared only
in republican governments, there would befome
color for charging them as a reproach to these
forms: but they appear as frequent and as vio
lent in despotisms and monarchies, as they do in
commonwealths. In all the despotisms of Asia
and Africa, in all the monarchies of Europe, there
are constant fucceftions of emulation and rivalry,
and consequently of conceits and di (Tendons among
families. Defpocifm, which crushes and decapi
tates, sometimes interrupts their progress, and
prevents some of their tragical effecfts. Monar
chies, with their spies, lettres de cachet, dun
geons and iriquifitions, may do almost as well.
But the balance of a free government is more ef
fectual than either, without any of their injus
tice, caprice or cruelty. The foregoing examples
from the History of France, and a thousand others
equally striking which might be added, (how that
Bourbons and Montmorencis, Guises andColignis,
were as fatal families in that kingdom as the
Buondelmenti and Huberti, the Donati andCer
chi, the Rici and Abbizzi, or Medici at Florence.
Instead of throwing falfe imputations on re
publican governments ; instead of exciting or fo
menting a vulgar malignicy against the most re
fpetfiable men and familiesâlet us draw the pro
per inferences from history and experienceâlet
us lay it down for a certain faift, firlt, that emu
lation between individuals, and rivalries among
families, never can be prevented : second. let us
adopt it as a certain principle that they ought
hoc to be prevented, but directed Co vircue, and
'hen Simulated and encouraged by generous ap
plauTe and honorable rewards. And from chele
premises let the conclusion be, as it ought to be,
that an effectual controul be provided in the con
tution, 10 check their exceilcs and balancetlieir
If ihis conclulion is not drawn, ano

CONGRESS has 110 armiesâand if it had, our
people might mock at force if that only was
used to govern them. It mud frame its laws on
such principles as an enlightened public will ap
prove : let the public then form its opinions calm
lyâlay facfts and arguments before it. Those
who do not chufe to be calm may give vent to
their passions in the Gazettes; a free press is a
sluice-way which lets off the torrent : But do not
blind the public with authority ; do not flop the
ufeful progrels of enquiry by telling it it is too
late, the trial is over, the point is adjudged by
the State legislature ; is there not danger that
this decision of a State will make right opinions
too liafty and wrong ones too obllinate, so as to
render the former despicable and the latter per
nicious ?
Every man may judge for liimfelf whether State
resolutions will croud narrow local prejudices in
to Congrels, or whether they will secure us an
adniiniitration upon liberal national principles.
The public will judge too whether a State go
vernment is the mod impartial judge of the con
du<ft ofCongrefs. It is best that a cause ftieuld
not be carried for trial before a tribunal which
is fufpeCied to have an interest in giving judg
ment against the defendant.
I am proud of iny country, becaufc I know chat
the government of it is a free one, and I think
it is well administered, but these bleflings are loft
to him whose mind ispoifonedby suspicion. To
vapourish women and hypochondriac men, even
health is no blessing. If State resolutions andin
(lruiftions convince liim that he is governed by
knaves in Congress who have bound liberty fall
for {laughter, he is more to be pitied than a fa
tisfied slave. He will even make a bad defender
of that liberty which, though he values, he deems
loft.
Ic cannot be denied that State resolutions may
be used to pull down a government. When the
national administration shall have become so cor
rupt and wicked as to be intolerable, this inflru
ment of deftrutftion may be employed with suc
cess. Perhaps fomc men in the State legislatures
are of opinion that the proper time for begin
ning this work of deftruftion is already arrived.

Philadelphia, April 20.
ExtraElfrom the Minutes of the House of Representatives of the Com
monwealth of Penrijylvania.
FRIDAY, April 8, 1791
THE Address to the National Aflembly of France, read April 6th
inft. was read the second time, and adopted unanimously, viz.
SIR, .
THE Representatives of the People of Pennfylvama, have unan
imously concurred in the desire of expressing to the Nation
al Assembly of France, their sympathetic feelings on the fubjeft of
their virtuous exertions in the cause of freedom : 1 hey lincerely
offer their congratulations on the success that has attended them,
which they have viewed, in its progress with the most pleasing
and anxious sensations.
A nation which has been aÂ£luated by such magnanimous policy,
which, with a noble enthusiasm, so generoullv mterpofed its pow
er, lo profufely poured forth its treasures, and mingled its blood
with ours, in defence of the liberties of America, is entitled to a
grateful return of our regard, and to the warmest wishes that sensi
bility or attachment can express.
It was under the operation of these feelings, that we have al
ways lamented that a brave and gallant people, who have become
the voluntary companions of our freedom, should not themselves
be free ; that after having aflifted in ereÂ£hng for us a temple of li
berty, they Ihould return to the house of bondage. Fortunately
the scene is changed, and your present situation awakens the molt
amiable sympathies of the human heart.
We now view, with grateful exultation, your glorious triumph
of reason over prejudiceâof liberty and law, over flaveryand def
poric will. You have nobly broke the fetters that bound you to
, our former government, and have, *n the view of astonished Eu
iOpe, undertaken a revolution, founded on that pure and elcrnen
825
Hkso
[Whole No. 207.]
:ary principle, that the people are the source of power, that in them
it is naturally inherent, and from them can alone be derived.
The truth of this hallowed maxim, the pride and boast of our
American constitutions, could not remain undiscovered, and un
attended to, amidst the blaze of patriotism and philosophy which
has long enlightened France.
We rejoice that your government, though differently organized,
is eltablifted on such congenial principles,as to cement byftrong
er, because more kindred ties, the friendftip that nowconnefls us.
As an evidence of this disposition, we can allure you that the
fuffrages and sentiments of our citizens are all united in the warm
est predileÂ£tions for your cause, and your country. We antici
pate the happiness and glory that will await you, when those var
ious resources by which you are surrounded, and which nature
has so profufely lavished on you, shall be put into energetic motion
by the operation of a free government.
We fondly hope that no untoward or inauspicious circumstance
may intervene to interrupt your glorions career, until you have
effe&ually restored to the bleflings of equal liberty, civil and reli
gious, so many millions of our fellow-men ; until you have abo
lifted the odious and arrogant diftinttions betwixt man and man
âuntil you have implanted in the minds of the people, a generouÂ»
and paflionate enthusiasm for their country, instead of a confined,
though romantic, attachment to the person of a King.
But whilst viewing with awe and admiration the principles you
have eftablifted, and which we ardently wist may defy the ef
forts of time, tyranny and treachery to overthrow, we cannot but
rejoice that you have been expoled in your progress to few of
those convulsive struggles, that so strongly marked thevarious aeras
of the American Revolution.
If our solicitude for your success could be cncreafed from the
operation of extraneous motives, it would receive considerable
force from the animating and philanthropic refle&ion, that other
nations of Europe, from the influence of your example, will learn
to value and vindicate the rights of man ; and that such political
institutions will be more generally eftablilhed, as by experience
are found to contain principles favorable to the happiness of our
species, and suited to the dignity of our nature.
To the Prejidznt of the National Assembly of France.
From the New-Havbn Gazette
I HAVE frequently observed, that those per
sons who are troubled with weak or defective
eyes, endeavour to remedy the evil by using
fpecftacles with coloured glades. The prevalence
of this pra<3ice is an indication of the inattenti
on of man to fubjeifts of the utinofl. importance ;
and will be some apology for the following re
marks.
Every person who has removed suddenly from
a very dark situation to a strong light; or the
contrary, is confeious of having experienced a
very painful sensation. The sudden dilation or
contratftion of the pupil of the eye, and the vio
lent exertion which is required in the surround
ing inufcles,to enable us to perceive obje<Siswith
diltindtnefs, when the quantity of light has been
much increased or diininifhed, strain and injure
the vifive faculty. Coloured fpedtacles operate
in a similar manner; and consequently every
time we put them on, or take them off, the eye
fuffera. Thus the weakness we designed to re
move is perpetuated ; and after having accustom
ed ourselves to the use of them for some time,
the eye becomes so tender, that we are never af
ter able to relinquish with facility the ailiftance
, they afford us.
If the light proves troublesome to theeye, na
ture has pointed out the manner in which the
remedy should be applied. In a very ftronglight
we always projeA our eyebrows to preserve oÂ«ir
eyes. This should teach us that the proper mode
of excluding all the fuperfluous rays of light, is
to suspend a shade from our foreheads.âFor thiÂ»
only diminishes the quantity of light, without
altering its natural qualities by any interposing
medium.
There are two methods by which we can de
termine, whether a parcicular pair of fpedtacles
is injurious to the eye:âr. If it is evident that
that organ has been {trained or fatigued, we may
conclude that the convexity or concavity of the
glafles we have used, was not adapted to the si
tuation of our eyes: This inconvenience is not
confined to the colour, and can only be remedi
ed by changing the form of the glass.â2. If af
ter having used Spectacles tor some time, we
lliould find upon removing them, that every sur
rounding objetSl is tinged in a disagreeable man
ner, we may conclude that the eye has been for
ced into an unnatural state, and has consequent
ly fufFered : coloured glafles produce this effetft.
Besides, green is not transparentâAnd if, by
indulging ourselves in the practice of wearing
coloured Spetftacles, we should become so much
habituated to their uSe, as to be unable to fore
go their assistance without the greatest inconve
nience ; in the decline of life, when the decreas
ing convexity of the humours of the eye, renders
it neceflary that we should employ convex glafles,
coloured ones will by no means answer the pur
pose for which they are designedâThe eyes of
elderly persons are defective on two accounts ;
i fir ft, because the rays of light do not convergeto a focus until they have parted the retina: and
secondly, because a greater quantity of light is
neceflary to imprint an object with diftinCinels
upon the retina. Convexglafles of any kind will
remedy the fii ft defect ; but if they are coloured
they will ditninilh initead of increasing the quan
tity of light the eye receives; and will be found
to operate exactly in an inverse proportion to
onr wants. The more defective the eye becomes,
the stronger mult be the light it requires, the
more convex must be the glass it uses, and 11
lhatglafs is green, the greater will be the quan
tity of light excluded.
I offer these hints to the public, that tliofe who
have weak or defective eyes may examine this
fubjea, and discover whether for a temporary
convenience they do not expose themselves to
greater inconveniencies, which may arise at a
period when it will be too late to think of devi
line any remedy for their calamity.

AFTER the debates which were finiftied by
the law relative to proclamations, the Diet
entered on the question proposed to know whe
ther they should lefume the business of the Car
dinal laws, some of which had already been de
creed by the Diet, previous to its new conftitu
lion, or if they lhould proceed to regulate the
form of government. Upon this occofion some
violent debates ensued, and a great disorder pre
vailed throughout the afl'embly. Matters even
rose to such a height, that some Nuncios endea
voured to oblige the Marshal of the Diet to join
them, to separate themselves from the Senate,
and take polTefiion of the Nuncio chamber. The
Marshal of the crown thought to restore tranqui
lity by putting to the vote the question which
occasioned the disturbance, but the tumult only
increased. They reproached hitn with exceed
ing his authority in putting the question without
its having been called for. The King, however,
at length brought them to be quiet; and it was
resolved that the question should be put the next
day, whether they should proceed with the form
of government and Dietines, before they began
to discuss rhe Cardinal laws. They were a long
time in collecting the votes on this occasion, as
each member gave his motives for voting as he
did. Nearly all the Senate, the Marlhals of the
Diet, and a great number of Nuncios voted for
rhe continuation of the Cardinal laws ; but rhe
majority were for previously beginning with the
form of government, and in the firft place with
the new form to be given to the Dietines.
The decision of the republic relative to the suc

whole provinces are againfl an hereditary suc

INHABITANTS AND ELECTORS OF IRELAND.
From the detailed statement given at different
times of the population of that country,it appears
that the number of inhabitants in the nine north

1.323,228
are
In the twelve eastern and midland
counties of the province of Leinlter,
are
In the fix southern counties of the
province of Muniter, are 1,011,498
And in the five western counties of
the province of .Connaught, are
Making a sum total of 4)166,418
Of these the electors of all the counties, cities
and free towns amount not to 60000âa dilpro
portion flriking and fhameful and that loudly
calls for immediate correction.
The progress of improvement, and the conse
quent increase of wealth, will no doubt effedit

causes should be accelerated by the spirit of the

The following is one of the principal causes
ofDividends remaining unclaimed,and weftrong
ly recommend the public to attend to it. A
named John Smith, dies, and leaves
James Brown, executor. James Brown does not
take the Stock into his own name, but with a
view perhaps to avoid a trifling fee to the Clerk,
has his name added ro the original account, so
that he receives his dividends in the name of
Smith, till his dying day.
His executor then applies to the Bank to know
what stock stands in the name of James Brown :
he enquires of the Clerk under the letter B. who
answers there is no Stock in Brown's name ; the
clerk having no concern with the Ledger under
the S. can give no intelligence with refpe# tothe
name of Smith, so that it frequently happens
that both principal and interest are 101 l and neg
ledled altogether.
In order therefore to avoid this mistake in fu
ture, we advise all executors to take their stock
into their own names immediately, and the pub
lic in general, whose friends or relatives were
ever known to be interested in the funds, to en
quire after the names of those persons to whom
such relations were executors: this,in many instan
ces, will lead to discoveries not only of dormant
dividends, but also of the dormant principal.

Infant re-animation, by Mr. R. Thompson.
I was lately called to a lady, who was deliver
ed of a child to appearance dead ; I ordered ltto
be put before the fire, and as soon as I could
leave my patient, which was in about a quarter
of an hoar, I examined the infant. It was dead
ly cold, its face livid, and no signs of life re
mained. The father, who was of thtf profefiion,
was fatisfied it was dead ; but I rubbed it with
warm flannel, and inflated its lungs by blowing
in the mouth frequently. By persevering in
these methods, I had at length the pleasure to
perceive signs of returning life, and the child is
now a very fine girl. The gratitude and tran
sport of the parents, will be better conceived
than language can possibly describe.

PITTSBURGH, April 9
For two weeks past we have had no accounts
of any depredations being committed by the In
dians, and from every appearance there are none
of tliem in our neighbourhood. Several parties
of volunteers, both from Weftmoreland and Al
leghany counties, have been scouting on the weft
fide of the Alleghany, but have made no disco
veries of any frefh signs.
A company of militia, consisting of ico men,
have been drafted from the four battalions in
this county, and are now scouting on the weft
fide of the Alleghany ; they are to serve two
months, and, no doubt, they will be relieved by
an equal num'ber, to be drafted for the fame
purpose.

CHARITY A-LA-MODE.
FROM southern climes a wandering veflel came
That from her looks or size small note could claim :
Her freight compell'd in port to stay,
Long by the walls this empty schooner lay ;
In vain the Capt. fe ch'd his fapieut flcull,
And flufh'd her masts, and painted up her hull,
No fails to trim, no work but mixing grog,
Pensive he fate, and long'd to heave the log ;
In vain he fearch'd, and ftopt up every leak,
Ana aavertis'd his bark from week to week.
All would not do !âthe dock was still her fate
Idle the Master, unemployed the Mate ;
While, with the tide (he lay to rife and fall,
The wharfinger, 'twas thought, would take her all.
At length a man, who had much gold in flock,
One morning fair, came waddling to the dock,
Addrefs'd the Capt. as he pensive fate,
And cry'd " what fay you, friend, wilt take a. freight ?"
" Take it ! (said Jonas) take it ! âthat I will
Take it as quick as patient takes a pill ;
This idle life's the very worst disease : â
But, let me know your terms, Sir, if you please,"
" Afv terms are so andfo" the merchant cry'd.
" What! sixpence less than all the world beside ?
What reafoncan be given, I humbly aflt,
That fix-pence ftiould be dipt from every caskâ
Five (hillings, truftme, is the usual freight,
And given by every ftiipper in the State."
" That may be soâthe miser said (most cool)
And yet there's one exception to the rule.
If you're arerfe, there's hundreds will agree,
This sixpence fav'd is meant for charity ;
My terms are goodâÂ»you can't be angry, sure,
Each fix-pence fqueez'd from you, fhallblefs the poor ! n

Extract of a Utter from N;iv-Tork
" A society has been lately instituted here, for
the promoting of agriculture, the arts and ma
nufactures : It bids lair to be ufeful, and if the
fliftridt secretaries are public spirited and atflive,
it will be the means of advancing the general
interest, and circulating important information.
Exertions have been made to stimulate the legis
lature to imitate our brethren of Pennsylvania,
in roads and inland navigation : These attempts
have been but partially fuccefsful, but the germ
public spirit is quickening into birth, and I
forefee the spirit of emulation operating on our
Dutch Bottoms. The finances of our state
a mod pleasing situation ; exceeding, perhaps
the whole political world. The probability of
3 fuflicient fund in theftocks of the United States
to yield an interest after all debts are paid,
equal to supporting our civil lift ; this will fuper

The present situation of the United States mud
inspire the mind of every Philantropift with the
molt pleating reflection, and the bosom of every
patriot with sensations moreeafily conceived than
described.
So great, sudden and compleat a transition
from weakneis, confulion and discord, to strength
order, union and refpetlability, as this highly
favoured country has experienced, is absolutely
beyond ail parallel in the history of man ; and
while it forcibly imprefl'es on the mind a power
ful conviction of the excellency of a government
which in so (bott a period has produced such af
tonifiling effects, the people of these free states,
cannot fully realize their obligations ofgratitude
to the Supreme Legislature of the Universe, for
thus guiding their feet into the paths of " Peace,
Liberty, Safety," under the aufpicesofa free
conltitution.
Tuesday Evening last, the Hon. Judge Wilson

those who have attended them, reflect great ho

Extract of a tetter from Amsterdam, to a gentleman
in this City, dated Jan. 16,1791.
" The admiralty of this country are endea
voring to colledt information with refpeift to our
ship timber, and particularly the live oak. They
have applied to Mr. refpedting it. Unfor
tunately the carpenters of the United States are
in the habit of employing timber 111 an unsea
soned state. This has already thrown our ship
ping into discredit which will prevent that art
becoming an important addition to our commerce,
unless the evil can be remedied by some means
or other. Some houses here had ordered iliipsto
be built in America by way of experiment. They
have turned out so badly, notwithstanding the
cheapness of the firft cost, that they have aban
doned the prosecution of their objectâand this
has induced others to follow their example with
out the expence of an experiment.
" Samples of the fiigar of the maple tree re

from them, that they intend to fend refiners
there, and endeavor to introduce this article in
to the commerce between this place and the Uni

some time before enough is made for our own
consumption, and that until then it cannot be
come an article of exportation."
By an extratftfrom the Leyden Gazette of Jan.
7 it appears that all the French Bifliops (except
ing only the Biftiop of Aucun) persist in refufing
to take the oath lately ordered by the National
Aflembly. The Aflembly refufes to give them
any longer timeâand thus all the high Clergy,
and not a few of the second order also, are up
on the point of feeing themselves deprived of all
their places, and of all their revenues. A letter
from Paris of 15th Feb. fays however, that three
quarters of the Clergy in the Kingdom have taken
the oath. The carnage of Ifmael continued for
two complete daysâthat is, there were two days
of human slaughter, after all resistance had ceas
ed. Thus was revived the infernal mode of
butchering our fellow creatures, which for the
honor of modern humanity we were led to hope
was totally extin<st. But fnch are the effects of
unreftained power, and lawless ambition in eve
ry age.
A school for inftruifting indigent blind per

House of Reprsfcntattves of the United States,Yeb. 23
IN the debate on the report of the felecft com
mittee, to which was referred the meflage of
the President of the United States, of the 14th feb.
MR. BALDWIN
Made the following remarks : He said he was
of opinion, that no person, who was not under
the influence of strong passions on this fubjeA,
could fuppofeit possible for Congress to form and
pass a navigation law, during the five days that
remained of the prelent session. It cannot be for
gotten, said he, that this has been considered in
general in this country as one of the greatest,
and at the fame time, 1110 ft difficult and perplex
ed fubietfs that had ever presented nfelf to the
councils of the country. The difficulties and
perplexities which it had occasioned, were among
the principal causes, and may almost be said to
be the onlr cause, which brought about our lalt
revolution". He then particularly alluded to the
different stages of the progress of this business,
as well in the proceedings of the several States,
as of the old Congress, and also of the federal
convention, which formed the conft.tution And
with this view of the importance and difficulty
827
of the fubjeft, can tills liotife, heaflced, after hav
ing been nearly eighteen months in acftual feflion,
on other business, which they have supposed more
important, expect to be able to take up ihis, do
j lift ice to ir, and finifh it in five days ? He 'was
lure the house was not yet fi> hardy in managing
the difficult affairs of io difficult a government,
and could not withold expressions of his surprise
to find some gentlemen, whom he hail so much
refpecfted for their wisdom and moderation, so
much engaged in this projetfi.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE USITED STATES.
A Gentleman being asked to fubferibeto the plan of the Sunday
Schools, declined, and gave the following reasons :
lft. Public subscriptions of all kinds are a very unequal and un
just mode of taxationâthe wealth) never pay their proportion.
2d. Jnftitutions that the public interest is so eflentially connect
ed with, as those of Education, ought not to depend on a
casual support.
3d. In this free country, it is laying the foundation of a servile
disposition in the rising generation, to make the poor depend on
charity for education.
4th. Charitable institutions of this kind, never were, or can be
made commensurate to the great object of a universal diffufion of
the means of knowledge among the poor ; not one tenth part of
the poor in any country, where they depend on Charity Schools,
ever receive any education at all.
sth. A little Chanty will atone for a total neglect on the part of
government, in not making that provision, which every di&ate of
humanity and found policy urges, should be made by law, to sup
port a general plan of school education.
6th. In this country, the acquisition of a decent competency is
within the reach of every person whatever, who duly improves
fix days in the weekâthe sabbath therefore ought to be a day of
reft to all ; but if our children are to work like (laves fix days, as
the children of the poor are neceflitated to do in European coun
triesâand on thefeventh areto be confined to the shade of a school,
the sabbath will soon, as in the language of scripture, prove a bur
thenâand religious worfhipand education become their aversion.
7th. The poorer and middling classes of citizens form the ma
jority in all countries; and in a republican government, ought to
have at least, equal influence in society with the rich; this, they
never will attain to, so long as they depend on the charity of their
opulent neighbors for the education of their children.
Bth. There can be no excuse for negle&iug the public interest
of education ; for the means judiciously applied, will always be
found adequate to the end, in every country.
The gentleman added, that tho he had no children, yet so fully
was he convinced of the importance: of diffufing knowledge a
mong all claflcs, without diJlinttion y that he would cheerfully pay
his proportion of public taxes for the support of public schools,
in which every citizen should have a right to have his children
inftru&cd in those branches of learning, eflential to all ; and this
he conceived would be not only the best, but the mod economi
cal plan that could be adoptedâit had, he fdid, the Left of ex
perience in its favor, at least.
The Empress of Ruilia rejects the terms which
the allied and mediating courts propose as the
basis of peace : She fays that the ceflion of the
places she has taken, would not be likely to pro
duce a lasting peace; but would occasion bicker
ings between the two courts.
Other accounts fay that the face of affairs on
the continent aflumes a pacific afpecft. The bel

his principalityâhe went to the cathedral attend

his highness on his return.

City of RICHMOND, Virginia,
To GEORGE WASHINGTON, Eft. PRESIDENT of the UNITED
STATES.
SIR,
IF in you the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonality ofÃichmond
beheld only the chief Magistrate of the United States of Ame
rica, they would indeed feel all that refpefl which is due to the
ruler of a free people ; but when they contemplate those virtues
which have excited the universal approbation of your own coun
try, and the admiration of all mankind, they cannot approach
you without emotions of veneration too big lor utterance too
pleafmg to be foppreffed.
If the voice of the people be the trumpet of the Almighty, the
univeifality of that gratitude which pervades every bosom in Ame
rica, will ever remain an inconteftible proof of the plaudit of
Heaven on the fortitude and wisdom which secured to our com
mon country independence and empire, and which now leads her
to wealth and glory.
We well know that to a mind like yours, fraught with bene
volence and affe&ion for all mankind, the gratitude and love of
the nation which you have saved mull be the best and moll pleas
ing reward ; yet we are aware that to such a mind nothing could
be more painful than that servility which would convert the sen
timent of love into the language of adulation ; we shun therefore
the expreflion ef the one, leoft we ftiould incur the imputation of
the other ; and while we beg leave to congratulate you on the
astonishing success which has heretofore attended all your endea
vors for promoting the public welfare, we look forward with
confidence and joy to the continuance of that administration,
which, through the hlefling of the Supreme Being, hath been al
ready productive of so much general happiness to the American
empire ; and we implore that Being, propitiously to smile on all
your future designs, to guard and protest you in your intended
tour, to grant you every earthly good, and that, when his provi
dence fliall fee fit to summon you hence, you may be wafted to
the regions of eternal happiness, lamented by men and welcomed
by angels.
The PRESIDENT'S Reply to the above.
Gentlemen,
THE very distinguished manner in which you are pleased to
notice my public services, and to express your regard towards
me demands and receives a grateful return.
If to my agency in the afFairs of our common country may be
ascribed any of the great advantages which it now enjoys, I am
amply and moll agreeably rewarded in contemplating the happi
ness, and receiving the approbation of my fellow citizens, whofc
freedom and felicity are fixed I trull for ever on an undecaying
bafisef wisdom and virtue.
Among the bleflings which a gracious providence may be
pleased to bellow on the people of America, I shall behold with
peculiar pleasure, the prosperity of your city, and the individual
happiness of its inhabitants,

obligations to you can be better felt than described ; and we trust
will not only influence the present generation, to admire public
and private virtues, from your example, but teach your fucceflors
how to watch over the welfare of this extensive Union.
We have the fulleft confidence in Divine Benevolence, that the
Disposer of all good will be graciously pleased long to continue

LIVERPOOL, March 3.
JOHN WESLEY.
On Tuesday evening died, of a gradual de
cay, the Rev. John Welley, in the 88th year of
his age.
This extraordinary man was born in the year
1703, at Epworth, a village in Lincolnlhire, of
â which place his father, Samuel Wefley, was
Redtor.
At a proper age, John was sent to Chrifi: Church
College, Oxford. About 1725 he was eledted
Fellow Â©f Lincoln College. In 1729, he joined
a society of fellow students in private devotion,
and from this his spiritual career may be dated.
In 1735, he embarked for Georgia, in order to
convert the Indians, but returned to England in
1737, where Mr. Whitfield had commenced the
â work of reformation. In 1738 he visited Count
ZinzendorfF, at Hernhuth in Germany, the chief
of the Moravians. We find him in England a
gajn in the following year, and on April 2, he
preached his firft field sermon at Bristol, from
which time his disciples have continued to en
creafe. He remained the reft of his days in this
kingdom, travelling through every part of it,
and eftablifhiug congregations in England Scot
land, and Ireland.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
In 17jo he married a Lady, who died in 1781 â
by her he has 110 children
Mr. Wefley's income was prodigious, not less
than io,cool. a year; but oot of that he appro
priated no more to his own use than was fuffici
ent to supply the necefl'aries of life. The money
went to build chapels, and pay his preachers
throughout the kingdom.
