AGRICULTURE,
Experiment todetermine whether itisbrfl to plant Urge or fmatl cuttings
of Potatoes ; in a letter from the Rev. Mr. Cochran to the Secret n \
of the Agriculture Society Jor the County of Hants, dated Wind/or
(Nova-Scotia) February 12, 1791.
6 I R,
TN the Nova-Scotia Magazine, J for Dec. 178 c), there appear-
X ed some extiu&s from an EfiTay on Potatoes, publilhed anions
the papers of the Bath Agricultural Society, tor 1788. In thefc
a prodigious difference is noticed, between the produce from large
ciii rings and that from small, in favor of large ones, as nine to one.
That a considerable difference of produce might elcape the ob
servation of mere practical farmers, who seldom make compara
tive experiments, is readily to be supposed, and that, therefore,
it might still be a disputed point amongst them, whether large or
i'mall cuttings are most profitable, as the author who relates those
experiments asserts it is, and as we know it to be here : But we
can hardly suppose that any farmer, who should fee one acre in
his neighborhood's field produce as much as nine in his own,
would continue inattentive to the advantage of using larger feed.
In the extracts, where this amazing disproportion of produce
is mentioned, it is not stated what proportion the cuttings, uled
in the one and in the other cale, bore to each other. Probably
1 here was a greater difference than between those which are com
monly used here. However if the lofsby planting Imall cuttings
ihoulc! only be one half, or even one fourth part of that mention
ed above, still it would be an objtft highly deferviug the atten
tion of farmers. I thought therefore, it might be a u!eful experi
ment, to try two or three different sizes of cuttings, near to those
nfually planted in this neighboihood, and to mark the difference
of produce, if anv. /
For ihts purpose, in the second week June last, I took an equal'
number of cuttings, of three different fr/.es ; the largest (No. i.);
"were somewhat larger than thole ulually planted here. The fe
rond size, which I (ball call No. 2, was lets than one half of No.
The third size (No. 3.) was about one thud of No. 2.*
I planted 100 hills with each size, four cuttings in each hill.
The land, manure, and cultivation as nearly alike as 1 could
make them.
From the firft appearance of 1 lie* plants a striking difference,
in favor of the largest size, was obfcrvable. Many of the hills from
No. 1. had ten, twelve, or fourteen (talks, ilrong and healthy.
Those from No. 2. much fewer and weaker. Those from No. 3,
in many instances had not more than four stalks, and those I mall
and feeble. The difference, though still veiy perceptible, was
not so great towards the end of the fuinmer, as at the beginning.
In the beginning of November they wac all taken up and ihc
pioduce weighed
No. 1. produced 2 8o!bs.
No. 2. 2/ioi
No. 3. 168
The medium weight of a bulhcl, upon fcyeral trials, was found
obe 611 b. Therefore the produceof No. : was something above
our hulhels and a half; and xhe difference between No. i. and
No. 3. nearly two bushel. This is very considerable. If an acre,
planted with cut'.iugs such as No. 1. would produce 200 bushels
by planting such as No. 3. the farmer will lose 80 bushels. In
iour acies the loss will be 320 bushels; in eight acres, which ma
ny farmers plant in a season, it will be 650 bushels !
I ain informed, that some farmers in the province plant only
ibe eyes of their potatoes, and give the reft lo iheir cattle or hogs.
AVith tbefe the loss tnuft be Oill greater.
I defigri to pursue the fiibitfct farther, and may hereafter com
municate the result to vhe Society. Meanwhile, â with the greatcft
icfpeÂ£t for you and them
1 remain, Sir, your most obedient,
And moil humble Itrvant,

* The cuttings oj each size mere weighed, and the weight voted at
the time of planting, but the memorandum has been mislaid. However,
01 though I cannot recollett the absolute zveight } lam tertuin the propor
tion to each other was, very nearly, as above.

that it cannot be iranfliAted. âThe following is an

FROM THE NLty-YORH DAILY ADVERTISER.
ADVICE TO COUNTRY TAVERN KEEPERS.
AS a great deal of custom is neceflaay to make good markets
and good inns, and as there is but little travelling, except on
public roads, the question is, how shall travellers on private roads,
where there i{. but little travelling, make provision; for entertain
ing gentlemen well, without futtering great losses. 1 i'peak not
of provision for Country people, tor these are willing to take ci
der and pot-luck, or ihecommon faie of the taverner's own fa
mily { but 1 speak of provision for people who have been accuf
torried to a city life and betjer cpok errand liquors. It appeajs tome
that provision fdTihe Tatter may be made, wfth on f~n ee dl et y~-w ast e.
You cannot, for example, buy a pipe of Madeira wine of the
firft qualit)âbut you can keep a gallon or two for many months,
and when gentlemen find aglafsof good wine in the country, they
are willing to give a good price tor it. But I would recommend
it to you to be more careful in the choice of }our wine. Few ot
you are judges of wine ; and wh-n you purcliafe, the wine fellers
turn you oft with any adulterated mixture they please. After a
great number of experiments, I can fafely declare, that nine times
out of ten, the wine 1 have called foi in Country Taverns has been
a mixture of Cider, Molasses. and a little real wine; or brandy
and wine, and not unfrequently with a strong tincture of Sugar of
lead. Such mixtures pass, in the country, tor Malaga, or other
sweet wine. To avoid impositions in purchasing wine, get some
gentleman who has always been used to wine to choose it for you,
and keep a little of the bejl quality lor such passengers as are v illing
to nav for it.
With refpe& to spirits, the fame advice is necessary ; but of the
quality of fpiiits you are better judges, and therefore lets liable to
imposition. Keep alio a little of the best kind of teas, as Hyfou,
Gunpowder, or Souchong; and good loaf Sugar. A small quan
tity of each will serve you for perhaps five or fix months. Moll
paffaigirs will not want these articles; they will not be able or
willing to Day for them, but a few will wish for them, because
they have always been accustomed to them : and you must make
a difference of piice between a breakfaft or supper of Bohea tea
and fryed pork, and one of hyson tea and loaf sugar.
With refpeft to meat, there is no difficulty, if you will have a
little forefight, You cannot indeed hive frefh meat every day,
and gentlemen do not like boiled pork and cabbage, cooked and
diflicd together. But if you will every winter provide a number
of good hams and bctj's tongues, vou may, in the warmest weaihei,
fpiead a table that no gentleman will find fault with.
In cooking take a word of advice. Use the Gridiron inflead
of ihe Frying pan. Do not road or broil meat until it is as dry
and tough as foal-leather. Meat slightly done, is both more pa
latable and more healthy. Do not boil meat and vegetables to
gether, unless you pur the vegetables in a bag. Do not bring
upon table different kinds of meat in the fame dilh ; nor meat
and vegetables in the fame di(h. Lrteach be brought on in a fe
paratedilh. Do not kill a fowl and put it warm over the fire.
A fowl is tough and good for nothing, unless it has been killed
24, or at lealt 12 hours. When vou bring on liquors, endeavor
to give every one a separate glass. If you have not enough in
the lioufe, you will be excused ; but gentlemen do like not that
all the company fhotild drink out ol the fame glass.
Endeavor to accommodate different companies with different
rooms. Nothing is more disagreeable than to croud a number of
strangers into the fame room ; or to oblige travellers to fit down
with grog drinkers in ihebar room ; furnifh yourselves if possible
with beds enough to give every lodger one to hiinlclf. It is a
monflrous indecent, as well as -infate prattice for perlons, per
haps total strangers, to deep 111 the fame bed. It is an affront to
a man to request it. And a word to you about keeping your beds
clean : Gi\e every decent man a decent bed. Every one ought
to have clean frefli (beetsâit is an imposition to ask a man to lay
on (beets, that have before been slept in by you know not who ;
you fav, it is a great trouble ; very well, then make your lodgers
pay for the trouble. Thofewho expert clean beds are willing to
pavforthem. In the hot months, talte special care that the beds
are not infefled with bugs. This is an article of advice verv 11c
refiarv for many of you. It is a filthy infamous negligence which
fufftrs these animals to trouble your lodgers. Nothing is more
ortcnfive to travelers, and nothing docs more toward injuring the
reputation of a tavern.
I trufl you will take these hints in good part ; for they are
meant for your benefit, as well as for those who travel.
I am, your ftiend

ALGIER S, July 15
BABA Mahomet, Dey of Algiers, died the 12th
iiiftant, in consequence of a dy fernery, ac
the age of 80 years, and 111 the 25th of his reigiii
Cid Hnfiiui, his prime ininifter, a man about 50,
was immediately proclaimed by the militia, and
the election was made withouc tuviult. The
three firft officers of the Regency had each pre
tentions to the sovereignty, but they very wil
lingly refigtied them, and were permitted to pay
their reipeifts to the new Dey. One of the thrde,
the onlyaga of the Spahis, was arretted and tak
en into cuitody the moment they were gonig to
enter the palace. His rival ordered, him to be
banilhed to a fort twelve miles from the capital,
and confifcated his estates.
The reign of Baba Mahomet was remarkable
for its brilliancy, utility, and tranquility. It is
to be hoped that that of Cid Hafl'an, who appears
to be favorably disposed towards France, will not
be less glorious. He fee ins eager 10 ratify the

and a divine, a great share of merit will not be
denied him by those who are acquainted with
his writings. His poetical wor&s are marked

THE PRELIMINARIES.
Agreed iipbn between the Allied Courts and
lluflia, as the basis for negociating the peace
between the Turks and liiiiijans.
On the 22d of July, the ministers of the allied
powers delivered a third memorial, which was
followed by an anfuter of the Ruiiian Court, da
ted the 27th of July, in which the Empress a
jrreed with the lninilters of the laid courts, ref
pecfting the conditions which are to fervc fortlie
basis of the pacification between Ruilia and the
Porte. These conditions conftlL in the following
points :
I. That the city of Oczakow, all its fortifica
tions, and its whole diftridt, (hall remain in the
pofleffion of her Ruffian Majelty.
11. That all the country situated between the
rivers Bog and Dneiller, Ihall for the future be
long to Russia, in a full fovcreignty.
111. That the river Dnielter (hall for the fu
ture determine the frontiers of both kingdoms.
IV. That the two powers ftiall have a perferfi
and equal liberty to eredt on the ihores of the
[aid river, which (hores lhall serve for frontiers
of the refpec r tive empires, as many fortrelles as
they ihall think proper.
V. That her Ruffian Majesty grants a free na
vigation on the river Dnieper ; and,
VI. That the Courts of London and Berlin
will engage to propose the said conditions to ih&
Porte, and agree to declare to the Divan, that
they could obtain no other conditions, from her
Imperial Majesty ; and that the allied courts ex
pert the Porte will make no difficulty in accept
ing them ; as, should the terms be rejected, they
(the allied courts) will much regret being un
der the necelfity to abandon the 1 urks to the
fate of war
These preliminaries having been signed by the
English and Prussian Miniflers, were immediate
ly Tent by couriers to' the refpetftive Courts to be
ratified.
Her Majesty the Empress has also fetit couriers

PORTSMOUTH, July ir.
This morning came into our harbor f rom
vrt-de-Grace, the sloop Trotters, Richard White,
niafter, having on board three cases, containing
an elegant model of the late French Prison, the
Baftile: It is cut out of one stone, and must have
been made at a great expencc ; a large ftancl,
exhibiting the Glacis and out-works which fiir
rounded that famous edifice, in ,the middle of
which it is intended the model of: the prison is
to stand, and then it will be a complete minia
ture representation of that emblem of defpotifin,
which the enlightened Frenchmen, to their greac
honor, have utterly demoliftied.
The third cafe contains a stone taken from the
ruins of the Baftile, iu which is inlaid a drawing
representing the fcite of that building, and in
scribed with the following words :
" Envoye a Mr. Stanhope, Prcjident de laSociet:

place in the precincfts of this town. Mailer
William Travel s (only son of Mr. John 1 ravers,
of this place) a highly proniifing lad, in the 14th

companied by a negro boy, who, in crofljng a
run of water, gave a spring, by which incident
the contents of the gun, which he held on l" s
arm, were fatally discharged, and entered the

' The latter cud of Julylalt, the Cherokess kill

the Chickafaws.
It is reported that the three towns of Creek In
dians, that flood out and would not accede to
the New-York treaty, have, through the great
exertions of M'Gillivray, ratified the fameâand,
it is generally expected that they will remain at
peace, if the Cumberland people will overlook
the depredations committed oil that settlement
during the lart summer.
The proprietors of the Muscle Shoals, on the
Teneflee, are determined to effetft a settlement
there, at the risk of every thing, and are making
all the preparations in their power for a number
of emigrants to let out early in November next.
The Creeks and Cherokees are very much a

both nations, sooner than fnffer that country to

Philadelphia, October 15.
The present situation of affairs in the Eastern Hemisphere exhi
bits a very motly appearance.
The fame papers which inform us of peace between Russia and
the Turks, give the details of battles, vittory and carnage. There
are strong rumors of attempts to effett a counterrevolution in
France. Â°The Banks of Venice, Genoa, See. it is said, have made
loans to the male-contents and exiled princesâthese on the other
hand are dependant on the Emperor's bounty for supportâthe
Prince of Conde has lately mortgaged his jewels. One account
fays the King of Sweden is inveterate against the National Aflem
bly; another fays he is very temperate and moderate in his refent
tnents; and even among the injured petty German Princes, there
appears to be a great fohifm in opinion. Some of the paragraphias
fay the frontiers of France are in a detencelefs state; but the re
ports made to the National Aflembly fay the fortifications are in
good repair. The English have made great preparations to com
pel the Empress of Rullia to make peace ; but Catharine, after re
peatedly beating the Turks, appears to have made a peace agreea
ble to herfelf. The National' Assembly have declared the person
of the King to be inviolable, but,ftill keep him in custody. The
King is however to have his liberty at Fontainbleau to accept of
the Constitutionâbut if he does not accept, he is to be no longer
King. There appears to be no doubt of his accepting it.
The English papers contain a letter from the King ot Sweden,
*0 hi& Ambassador at Parisâlll which he dirc&s that he (hould
keep from all intercourfc with the Revolutionists. Its authenti
city is donbted.
Infurre&ions have broke out in Switzerland âthe motto on the
buttons of the people is, " Live free, or die."
The Britilh Government has received favorable accounts from
India. Lord Cornwallis was before Bangalore with an army of
#5,000 men; and General Abercrombic within 40 miles of Se
ringapatam, with a large force. Tippoo has been uniformly
beaten, and the British armies were in high spirits.

u Mr. , who lately arrived from France, informed me that
the impositions on our oil, See. in that kingdom, are occalioned
merely on account of there being no d'.fcrimination made between
our allies, and those not in alliance with us. 1 hey fayâWhy
foould we admit your commodities free of duty, when you make
us pay the fame as the English do ?
" II Congress was to put 10 per cent, on all foreigners not in
alliance, and appropriate the proceeds of such a duty as a bounty
for the encouragement of the whale fifhery, it might prevent our
best whalers going to France and England, to carry on and learn
them the buhnefs. Uolefs the general government some
thing to encourage the business, you may depend that this great
article of commerce will in a few years be loft to the United States.

A mod extraordinary account is given in a letter from Bour
deaux, dated 2qth July lalt, of the conduct of Mr. Fenwick, the
American Consul at that place.
An American veflel. with 2?.q hhds. of tobacco, from Virginia,
was officially informed against by the Consul as not coming direÂ£l
from America. It seems (he had touched at an outport for orders.
He thought her cargo fhou!d not therefore be admitted to enter
for home ronfnmptionâin consequence the dire&or of the custom
house rcfufed to accept the inward duties theteon, and the con
signees entered the cargo for exportation. The queflion is, whe
ther a vessel from the United States, that touches at an out-port
tor advice or orders, without breaking bulk, is to be considered
as coming dirett from America ? The new French law faying that
" American tobacco can only be imported in French or American
bottoms coming dircft from America The consignees, Mcffrs.
M'Carthv and Brothers, fay that veffcls in the above predicament
are doubtless within the pale of the lawâthe American Consul
differs from them, and favs he acts by orders from Mr jpfferfon.
There are other vessels similarly situated. Time will elucidate
this business.

" Onfe of the Indian captives lately died- at
this placeâhis Excellency Governor St. Clair gave
liberty to the reft to bury the corpse according to
the custom of their nation : the mode is, that the
body be wrapped in a shroud, over which they
put a blanket, a pair of moggafins 011 th<; feet,
and seven day's rations by the fide of the head,
with other necefl'aries. The march from Fort-
Washington was very folenm ; on their arrival at
the grave, the corpse was let down, and the rela
tives immediately retiredâan aged matron then
descended into the grave, and placed the blanket
according to rule, and fixed the pro*ifion in l'uch
manner as fhethought wouid be mod handy and
convenient to her departed friendâcalling her
eyes about to fee if all was right, Hie found the
deceased was barefoot, and enquired why they
had omitted the moggafins ? The white person
who superintended the whole business, informed
her that there were 110 good moggafins in the
(lore, but that by way of amends they had put
a liifficiency of leather in the knapsack to make
two pair at the fame time shewing her the lea

have made a proper impression on the minds of
the Indian Nations in general, agreeable to the
trite observationâa thing well done, is twice done.
If a peace is patched up now, government will
soon have to begin the business dc novo; or the
poor Icattered citizens in these parts will once
more have to wade through a sea of blood.
" A few particulars refpeifting this country
may not be uninteresting loyou :
" Washington is thecounry town for iliecoun
ty of Mason, and is the second in point of popu
lation in Kentucky.
" The county of Hamilton lies between the
two Miami Rivers. J nit below the mouth of the
Little Miami is a garrison called Fort Miamiâ
Ac a small diflauce below this garrison is the town
ot ColumbiaâAbout lix miles from Columbia, is
the town of Cincinnati, which is the county town
of the county of Hamiltonâand here is erected
Fort-Wajhington, the Head Quarters of the Fede
ral Army. This fort is plealantly fltuated on the
banks of the Ohio, oppoiite the mouth of Lick
ing River. Seven miles below this is a fettle
mem of 18 or 20 families, called South Bendâ
about seven miles from this, also on the Ohio, is
the city of Miami, founded by the Hon. John.
Cleves Synimesâl2 miles up the Great Miami is
the settlement called Dunlap's Stationâand 12
miles up the Little Miami is a settlement called
Cavault's Station. The numbers of militia in
these places, according to the best accounts I have
received, are, at Columbia, 200 âCincinnati, I JO

"We have now had three expeditions from
Cenrucky against the Indiansâ the firft and latt
ippear to have been happily executed on every
accountâand notwithitanding the men were all
mounted, they did not fuflain any loss of confe
quencc, even in horses. The Generals in both
these expeditions appear to have been much
pleased with their men, and the men with their
commanders. The second expedition turned out
entirely unproductive, it was against a town,
which had been abandoned many months before
the arrival of the troops âand not being strong
enough to pufli forward to St. Duflcy; they re

RIOT KING'S BENCH.
MONDAY night, there was an alarming in
furredfHon in the King's Bcnch p'rifon, an
attempt being made by the greater part of the
prisoners to escape ; much inifchief was done to
the inner part of the prison, and the outer gate
would have been forced, had not a body of horse
and foot arrived to restore order, which they
liappily effected without any bloodflied, before
eleven o'clock.
The following are fonie of the particulars of
the riot : The prisoners having dined together
as a weekly Club, were a little elevated by li
quor, and aflembling in the yard, began to mur
mur at the delay of Mr. Grey's bill refpetlitig
debtors. Some of them even threatened to ef
fect their enlargement immediately, and tliey
deputed Major Pitcairn to wait on the Mar/fral,
and request that Colonel Harrington, who has
been eight months closely confined for having at
tempted to elcape, might be as much at liberty
as thenifeives ; but instead of their desire being
complied with, Major Pitcairn was 'detained in
custody.
This circumstance added to their discontent,
and they became more clamorous and desperate ;
when the Marlhal with some afiiltants went a
niong them, and seized two or three of the ring
leaders, but was so roughly handled thac he was
obliged to retreat. The violence of the prison
ers encreafing, the Marshal and all his officers
armed, and going into the area between the two
gates, they fired two guns into the air with a de.
Jlgn of terrifying the mal-contents, who endea
voured to provoke them, and threw a ftiower of
brickbats over the wall, by which they fractured
one man's JI.-ull very dangerously, wounded feve
xal others, and obliged the whole to retire to the
top of the Keeper's house, where they could fee
Awhat was doing, without rifting their pcrfonal
fafety.
.Mr, Bowes went among the crowd and liar
rangued iheni, but as lie advised peace and good
order, lie was so ill received that he found it
prudent to defifl ; and the Marlhal feeing the
danger thicken, and tliat a general aH'ault at 11-ie
gates might probably be made, he Cent a nieflen
ger to Jjiltice Hyde, who communicated tile in
telligence to Lord Ar.iherft ; two troops of horl'e
Avere dispatched, and in about an hour afterwards
they were followed by a party of the foot guards,
who went within the walls, and drew up before
the prison, when every renionltrance and periua
lion being used to pacify the rioters, at length
the majority of the prisoners retreated to their
rooms, and the riot was fortunately quelled. A
guard of twelve foot fbldiers within, aiul about
tsvenry horse without the prison, were left liow
ver all night, and it is supposed a party of mili
tary will hcnceforwaid always be stationed there.
Ycfterday fix of the ring-leaders iu the riot
were brought into the Marihal's house, and exa
mined before Justice Hyde, when several facfis
being proved againlt them, they were committed
to tlie new gaol in the Uorounh.
