LONDON, July 7
ESCAPE of the ROYAL fAMILY from PARIS
THE eft:ape of (he Royal Family was made at
one o'clock on Tuelday morning, June 21,
Jior was it dilcovered until between seven and
eight, wlien the Commandant of the Caflle of
the Thuilleries went towards the King's apart
ment, to fee whether his Majelty was stirring.
He was met by one of the houfbold, who told
him that neither the King, Queen, the Dauphin,
hoi the Princess Elizabeth, were to be found.
I he ili ess in which ihey efeaped is not so well
authenticated, nor do we believe that it is pre
cilely known to any one.
It was at ti. It 1 ulpetfted that M. de la Fayette
was p: ivy m the design, for no sooner was the
King's el'cape known, than he and Monf. Cazales
e Seized and held in confinement, until a
deputation from the National Aflerably rescued
them The people talked of no less than hang
ing rhein, and would have kept their resolution,
had not the pretence of the troops protected
them.
The Duke d'Aumont was likewise flopped by
the people, and the clothes torn offhis back. The
people were conducting hi in to the Plaa de Crevt,
with an intention of hanging him a la lanterne,
but he was fortunately rescued by the National
guard, and conducted to the guard house, though
not without (bine refinance, for the people re
fufed to give him up. He had been on duty the
preceding evening, and it is (ufpecfted he favor
ed the Royal escape. He has demanded to be
tried by a Court Martial
The escape was certainly made through one
jf the piivate doors of the Palace ; it is believed
through a pallage leading from (lie pavillion in
which the slept, and from which theie is
a private communication to rlie garden. This
avenue had 110 fen .ry pi.iced over it. It is said
that the Royal family got into 1 heir carriages at
the Pont Royal, a ihort diltance from the Palace.
The carriages confided of a be 11 in drawn by fix
horses, and two diligences. The berlin had been
made some time before for an officer of the Roy
al Guard, and held fix persons very coinmodioufly.
The pollill ions who drove the Royal Family from
Paris fay, that in the berlin were two women,
and two children, and in one of the chaises two
men of a swarthy complexion. They drove them
as far as Senlis. Several otficers of the King's
former body-guard attended at the efcapc, and
foine of them followed the Royal carriages at a
â¢ . - â Â» r*
little diltance drellea in liveries. About fifty
persons immediately in the confidence of their
Majelties are milling.
It is fufpe<fted that M. de Bouille, who com
mand!! in French Flanders, alfifted the escape
through the garrison towns under his authority.
The news of the escape became generally known
through Paris about nine in the morning, and,
as it in ly be supposed, created great confufion ;
the National guards were immediately ordered
mi !er arms, and double sentries ported at all
the ga es of i he ci y, with orders to prevent any
pe.fon from palling or repafling.
Many faces wore a countenance of surprise,
several car ied vjfible marks of terror, and a ge
neral difiiKty prevailed. The people, made amock
parade of t lie King's Arms in the Marketplaces,
and, dafliing them and the figure of a crown to
the ground, they trampled upon them, crying
outâ" Since the King has abandoned what he
owed to his high situation, let us trample upon
the ensigns of royalty !"
The King on rhe preceding; clay had mritten
:i letter with Iris own hand, addrefled to M.de la
Porte, one of the Ministers of Slate. This let
ter contains the reasons which induced his Ma
jelly and the Royal Family to make their escape,
Copy of the King's 1 rodamation to all the French,
rj'i his departure frotn Paris
" Whilfl the Kingconld hope to fee order and
happiness reilored by the means employed by
the National AflVtnbly, and by his own residence
rear that Alfembly, he fubniined to every (aeri
fied ; he was even content to bear the loss of his
liberty, of which he lias been deprived since the
month of October i 7P9 ; but now, when the re
fill! of all these operations is found to be the de-
Ururtion of royalty, the violation of property,
the wvafion of pei fonal security, the ellahlifli
mentof a compleie anarchy in every part of the
cmpiie, without any appearance of authority

fuffieient Co restrain it ; the King, afcer proteft
iug against all the adts extorted-from him during
liis captivity, thinks proper to submit to the eyes
of Frenchmen an accounc of his conduct.
" In the month of July, 1789, the King, rely
ing on his own integrity, came, without any ap
prehensions, among the Parisians. In the month
of Olftober of ilie fame year, fully informed of
the intentions of the factious, he dreaded left a
handle should be made of his departure, in order
to foment a civil war. ft is universally known
with what impunity crimes were then commit
ted.
" The King yielded to the wifli cxpreffed by
the army of Parisians ; came, with his family,
to reside in the palace of the Thuilleries ; no
thing was prepared for his reception ; and the
King, far from meeting with the accommodati
ons to which in his other palaces he was accus
tomed, did not even poflefs common convenien
ces. In spite of every constraint, he thought
proper, the day after his arrival, to give the pro
vinces assurances of his residence at Paris. A
more painful facrifice was Hill exacted ; he was
obliged to remove his Gardes du Corps, of whose
fidelity he was allured ; two of them weremallh
cred, and several wounded in executing the or
ders, which they had received, not to fire all
the art of the factious was employed toiGprefent
in the worfl light a faithful Queen, whose con
duel had been uniformly unexceptionable ; it is
even evident that all these machinations were di
rected againfl the King hiinfelf. It is to the sol
diers of the French Guards, and theParifian Na
tional Guard, that the care of the King's person
has been committed under the command of the
Municipality of Paris, froin whom the Comman
der General derives his authority. The King
thus has found him felt a prisoner in his own Hate
for what other name cm be given to him, who
is forcibly surrounded by persons whom he sus
pects. It is not in order to criminate the Parisi
an National Guard that I repeat this detail, but
in order to slate the real facts ; on the contrary,
I am ready to do juflice to their attachment,when
not under the influence of the factious. The
King ordered the Convocation of the States Ge
neral ; to the Third Estate he granted the privi
lege of a double reprefentatioo ; the re-union
of the Orders ; the Sacrifices of the 23d of June
âall have been his works, but his efforts have
been flighted and perverted. When the States
General aflumed the name of the National Afli. ni
bly, they revived the plots of the factious in se
veral provinces ; they revived those attempts
that had been made to reverse the inftrinftions of
their conflituents, which appointed laws to be
enacted in concert with the King. The Aflem
bly have removed the King from the Conftituti
on, by denying him the privilege of fandtioning
tonftitutional acts ; in which class they ranked
whatever acts they thought proper, restricting
to the third legislative body the privilege of re
fufing its fancftion. They have given him twen
ty-five millions which %re entirely absorbed by
the neceflary cxpences of his lioufehold. They
have left him the profits only ofcertain domains,
saddled with oppreflive forms : and have depriv
ed him of the patrimony of his ancestors ; they
took care not to comprehend, in the article of
expence, those services done to the King, as if
they were not inseparable from those of the slate.
1 Let the different parts of the adminiflration be
examined, it will be found that the King has no
longer a fliare ; he has 110 part ill enacting laws ;
he can only intreat the Aflembly to dirert their
attention to fnch and such subjects. In the ad
miniflration ofjuftice, nothing is left for him,
but to dispatch the commiflions ofthe judges,and
to name the coinmiflaries of the King, whose
functions are much less considerable than those
of the ancient Procnratoi s-general- The public
part has been committed to new officers ; and
one prerogative flill remaining, the niofl valua
ble of all, that of pardoning and remitting pu
nishments, has been taken away from the Kings,
and is now veftc-d in juries, in consequence of
their of explaining, according to their
pleafurp, the sense of the law. Thus the Royal
Majeftv is impaired, to which the people former
ly had recourse, as to the common centre of
goodnefi and beneficence. The internal admi
niftratjon of the departments is embarrafled by
wheels which obflruct- the motion of the ma
chine ; and the fuperimendance of ministers is
1 educed to nothing.

[Whole No. 245.].
'â¢ The Societies of Friends of the Constitution,
are mucli more powerful, and engrofsevery part
of the adlive adminiltratioii. The king lias been
declared supreme head of the army ; however,
every thing has been done by the Committees of
the National rtflembly, without my participation ;
they have granted to the King ihe nomination
of some places, yet the choice which lie has made,
has experienced contradiction ; lie has been
obliged to revise the operations of the General
officers of the army, because their choice displeas
ed clubs ; to them only are to be attributed the
greater number of the revolis of the regiments ;
when an army no longer refpedts it officers, ic
becomes the terror and firebrand of the ftaie:
the King has always been of opinion that officers
ought to be puniflied as well as soldiers, and that
the road to promotion ought no less to be open
to the latter according to their desert. As to
the foreign affairs, they have granted to the
King the nomination of Ambafladors, and the
conducfl of negociations ; but they have taken
from him the right of making war ; they ought
not however to have fufpedted that lie would e
ver declare war without special reason. Ihe
right of making peace is of a different foit. Ihe
King wishes only to a(ft in concert with the nati
on, but what power will enter into negociations,
when the right of reviling them (hall belong to
the National Aflembly,
" Independently of the necefTary secrecy,
vliich it is impofiible to preserve in an AHembly
vhofe deliberations are public, who would choose
o stipulate engagements, except the persons with
vhom they were formed had the power of rati
"ying them ? With refpeft to finances, the King
iad recognized before the States General the
ight which the nation has of granting fubfidics,
tnd in this refpecl he complied 011 the 23d June
ivith every thing that had been demanded. On
lie 4th February the King requested the Nati
jnal AfTembly to rake into conlideration the state
as the finances ; they deferred it too long ; they
have not yet a just statement of the receipt and
expenditure ; they allowed themselves to go in
to hypothetical calculations ; the ordinary taxes
are in arrear, and the resource which has been
employed of the twelve hundred millions of af
fignats is almost exhaufled ; they have left to
the King nothing upon this occasion but a barren
nomination ; he knew the difficulty of this part
of the administration ; and if it were pofiible
that this machine could have been put in motion
without his direcft fuperintendance, his Majesty
would only have regretted that there was no di
minution of the imports ; an object which he de
sired, and in which, had it not been for the Ame
rican war,he fliould most certainly have succeeded.
" The King has been declared Supreme Head
of the Administration of the kingdom, and he
has been able to change nothing without the de
cision of the AfTembly. The chiefs of the pre
vailing party have thrown out such defiance a
gainst the agents of the King, and the penalties
denounced against prevarications have occasioned
so much alarm, that thefe'agents have remained
without force. The form of government is in
two refpetfs particularly faulty ; the Aflembly
exceeds the limits of its power in interfering in
justice and the internal administration ; by its
Committee of Researches, it exercises the most
barbarous of all despotisms. It has established
afl'ociarions, known by the name of Friends of
the Constitution, which present corporations in
fini:ely more dangerous than the ancient; they
deliberate 011 every part of the government, and
exercise a power of such preponderance, that all
the bodies, and even the Aflembly itfelf, can do
nothing except by their order. The King does
not think it possible to preserve such a Govern
ment. In proportion as the period of the la
bours of the Aflembly approaches, the sages of
whom it is conipofed lose their credit. The new
regulations, instead of pouring balm upou the
fores, on the contrary inflame their malignity ;
a thousand journals and libellous pamphlets per
petuate the difordc, which the Aflembly is un
able to remedy ; their labours tend only to a go
vernment, meraphyficnl in its principles, and im
practicable in its execution.
" Frenchmen, Is it this which you intended
by fendingvour Representatives ? Did yon defile
that the defpotifni of clubs should replace the
monarchy under which the kingdom has pros
pered during fourteen hundred years? The at
tachment of Frenchmen to their monarch is rank-Ed among the number of their virtues. I have
received marks of it too affecting to be ever for
gotten; the king would not bring forward the
following, were it not to repiefent to his faith
ful fubjecti the difpofilion of the factious. The
people kept in psy for the triumph of M. Necker,
affected not to pronounce the name of King;
they, at this period, persecuted the Archbilhop
of Paris ; a courier of the King was rtopped,
searched, and the letters which he carried broke
open ; at this time the Allembly feeined to insult
the King; it was determined to carry to Paris
the words of peace; during his journey, they
Hopped, in order to fupprcO any cry of Vivt I:
Rot. They even made a motion to carry him off,
and to put the Queen in a convent ; this motion
was applauded. On the nights of the 4th and
sth, when it was proposed to the Afleinbly to go
and hold their fitting in the prefelice of the King,
the answer was, That it was not consistent with
their dignity to go thither. From that moment
the fcencs of horror were renewed. Upon the
arrival of the King at Paris, an innocent person
â¢was maflacred almult under his eyes, in the gar
den of the Thuilleries ; while all who abused re
ligion ami the throne received the honour of tri
umph. At the Federation of the 14th July, the
National Afienibly declared, that the King was
the head ; but in order to (how that they could
name another, his family was placed separately
from him ; it was then, however, that he spent the
mod agieeable moments of hisrefidence at Paris.
" When, from religious motives, Mefdames
wiltied to go to Rome, notwithftanditig the decla
ration of rights, their departure was opposed ;
they were carried to Bellevtie, and then to Ar
ney-'e-Duc, to wait the orders of the Aflembly
for their departure ; the authority of the King
was disregarded. In the tumult which fat'lioufly
disposed persons excited at Vincennes, thofewho
aflembled around the King from regard to his
fafety were maltreated ; so far was their inso
lence carried, that their arms were broken in the
presence of the King under whose protection they
were. When, to get rid of an indjfpolition, he
was preparing to go to Sr. Cloud ; in order to
Hop him, they availed themselves of the refpec't
which they knew he entertained for them, and
the religion of his father ; the club of Cordeliers
brought a charge agamft him as refractory to
the lawâin vain M. de la Fayette endeavoured
to protect him: they violently seized the faith
ful servants who surrounded him, and he again
relumed his prison. In fine, he was obliged to
oider the removal of his chapel, to approve the
letter of the Minister to foreign powers, and to
go to mass at the new curacy of Saint Germain
I'Anxerrois. With such motives, and in the im
possibility which the King feels to prevent evil,
ir is natural that he should endeavor to ensure
his fafety.
" Frenchmen, and yeu who are called inhab
itants of the good City of Paris, withdraw your
confidence from the suggestions of the factious,
return to your King, he will always be your
friend ; when your holy religion (hall be ref
pedted, when government shall be secured on a
firm footing, and liberty eftablilhed upon an un
ihaken basis. (Signed) " LOUIS."

The Ptefident refnmed the chair, and the As
fembly so med itfelfinto a deliberntive body.
One of the secretaries read a letter, ftatinp.
that three cil izens of Paris offered to the Aflem
bly a voluntary contribution for the payment of
the National Guards who (bould be employed in
the defence of the frontiers.
Monf. Mangin, the surgeon, who was the means
of apprehending the Royal Family, was the per
son dispatched to the National Aflembly, who
were deliberating at the moment, when a con
fufed cry was heard in the hallâ" He is taken !"
" he is taken !"
A packet was delivered to the President, when
the Secretary was ordered to read to the Allem
bly, a letter from the officersof the Municipality
of Varennes, dated the 21It of June. It was con
ceived in these terms:
To the President of the National Affemlly
" Sir,
" In the state of alarm which we are now in,
when every moment is of consequence, weamho
rife M. Mangin, Surgeon at Varennes, to wait
upon yon instantly, to inform you, thai the King
is now in our hands ! We beg of you to inform
us what condudt we are to puifue."
A letter was theti read from the officers of the
Municipality of Saint Menehnud, which gave an
account of various orders iliiied by M. iiouille,
commander of the troops, to fend to him a num
ber of troops of the line, as well in the Munici
pality of Menehoud, as elsewhere.
I he President announced that Mangin, from
Varennes, desired to be admitted to give an ac
count of the manner in which the Ki was Hop
ped. He was admitted, and gave the following
account:
" Yelterday, June 22, about one in the morn
ing, a carriage entered Varennes, which was not
suspected to contain the King and the Royal Fa
mily. It was efconed by a detachment of Lau
zun's hollars, and attended by several per Tolls
who acted as couriers.
" The Poll-Mailer of St. Menehoud, who en
tertained suspicions relpetfting the carriage, and
had followed it from Clermont, where the cou
riers declared that they were going to Verduu,
perceived that it took the road 10 Varennes. He
then got before it, and cried out ill the town to
stop a carriage that was paflinor
" Two young men, Paul le Blanc and Joseph
Ponfin, Hopped the carriage. The polfillions
whipped their horses, and the men threat
ened to fire into ihe carriage if they attempted
to proceed. The persons in the carriage order
ed them to flop. In the mean time several other
persons allembled, and gave the alarm. The tra
vellers alighted wiihout refiilanct. The Na
tional Guard fin-rounded the detachment of hus
sars, who also fabmicted. The Attorney-Gene

his house, where they alked for vefrethmrnr Â°
" Their quality was (hil unknown, when I en.
tered and recognized the King, the Qiieen t |,J
Dauphin, Madame Royale, and Madame Kliza

citizens, that it was the King ami Royal' Kam! v "
They profeffed the greatest zeal to oppose their
departure, and drove away foine officers of h-if.
fars and dragoons, who attempted to favor it __
The good countenance of the National Guards
and the firninefs of the Municipal Officers re â!
dered all tlieir attempts fruitlels.
" 1 iuftantly mounted a horse, ss did twelve'
of my fellow citizens. We rode from vjli:i<re to
village for alfil'ance, and in less than an hour We
collected above four thousand National Guard,
besides the hollars and dragoons, who joined u<*
and condu< r ted thetnfehes like good patriots. '
" When 1 saw that we could nnfwer for the
detention of the King and the Royal Family, {
hastened to the capital, to quiet the ininds of all
good citizens, and especially the reprefentativrs
of the nation. I set out at four in the morning,
and reached the barriers of Paris at seven in the
evening. The people of the capital, whom I in
formed as I palfed , prevented ine from appearing
sooner before this august Aflembly, by their ea
ger: efa to be afl'ured of the farts, which 1 have
now communicated."
The account was received with loud applause
and ordered to be printed.
The Aflembly having heard the different dis
patches, immediately ilfued ordersâ
rff. That Ihe most inviolable regard iliould be
paid to the fafety of the King's person, in con
ducting him to the capita'.
2d. That information should immediately be
conveyed to the whole kingdom, that the King
was taken.
3d. That M. Ronille fhonld be deprived of all
command, and immediately arretted.
Thrnf.iay Afternoon,
The President read the following letter from
the three couiniiflionei s to meet the King:
"La Fertefous Tottare âA'ire o'clock in the v/ornin^.
" The King left Chatons Jaft night, efcortea
by sin army of national guards, assembled from
;he neighbouring departments, as soon as the
news of his being (topped was made known. We
have given orders every where for the fateiyand
tranquility of the return of the King. We have
been effectually seconded by the dispositions of
:he citizens. The fentimenrs of the people are
every where the fame as at Paris; their deport,
ment is magnanimous, vet tranquil. We have
every where experienced teltimonies of refpetfi
and confidence in the National Afleinbly."
Letters from different departments were then
read, nil breathing an entire devotion to the de
crees of the National Aflembly.
A numerous deputation of t lie National Guard
was admitted, when M. la Fayette, the speaker
of the deputation, addrefled the President in the
following tpeech :
" Von fee before yon citizen?, who have never
measured theii zeal but by the exigencies ot their
country. They ask for the permillion of swear
ing, in your presence, that they will noc employ
those arms which they took up in the canl'e ot li
berty, except in the defence of the conllitution
and of freedom. The late occurrences, as far
as they have affeiled the people of the capital,
have been what all movements and procedures
fliould be which do not attack the rights of ci
tizens. If ic he true that the bold and impre!-
five serenity of which they have displayed so at
ferting an example, augments the fury ot our e
nemies, haflen to inform us of those places in
which thev can be discovered ; and may the Silt
soldiers who armed themselves in the defence of
liberty, become, likewise, the firft soldiers who
marched forwards to give battle to the champions
of despotism !"
The President made the following reply :
" From you it was narural to expert \he moffc
intrepid and virtuous efforts fur the prefervatioii
of rhe public freedom. All France is too sensi
ble of the obligations which you have alreai'y
bellowed, nor to suppose it certain, that, in die
sequel, yon will confer more. It is with jov, it
is with confidence, that the reprefeiiratives ot
the nation receive your oa hs. should our ene

united the Swiss Guards, and a great numbei o
citizens, armed and unarmed, entered with op'
lifted hands. They inarched across the ha ,

These having retired, were succeeded by a |( jj
rher patriotic phalanx, which also made the
reloimd wirh their oaths and acclamations

Two hours and a half were confumecl 11 ia ',

these with the fame acclamations.
(Tu lie ctntinusi.)L O N D O N, July 5.
It evidently appears that Louis lfith. intended to escape toMentz,
the capital of the Eleclor of that name, where the chiefs of the
counter-revolution now are. It is certain that he never meant to
go to Bru(Tels,and the report of the government raeflengerof his
having paflfed Douav, is wholly unfounded. Tiic king was to
have met the prince de Conde, the count d'Artois, and M. de Ca
lonne at Ment?, where the two former arrived the 13th instant,
accompanied by the dukes ot Boitfbon, and Ertgien, and were re
ceived under the discharge of a.w*ute of artillery, and on the pa
rade by a company of gren^tlie^y.

In confrquence of a decrce passed soon after the opening of the
National AfTembly on the morning of the 21ft of June, Mr. de
Rochambeau appeared at the bar. This venerabe soldier observ
ed to the aflemblv, that the decree which ordered him to head
the troops, and secure the frontiers, imposed on him a refponfi
bilitv, which perhaps exceeded his physical and moral power ,
as he was then at the age of seventy years ; but that he would ne
verthelefsfet no bounds to his zeal, and that thealleinbly and the
nation whom they leprefented, might depend on his fidelity.
Mr. de Rochambeau was accompanied by a number of general
officers, who as well as he, all bound themselves by oath to defend
the conflitution,
The last advices from China acquaint us, that the Emperor of

By private letters from Pcterfburgh, received by vefterday's
mail, we learn that Mr. Fawkener had his firft audience of the
Empress the id inft. seven days after his arrival at Pcterfburgh.
The fame day he was at Court, but very coaly received. The let
ters mention that the Empress made extremely ligi t of being
threatened into the measures of the allied Courts, by our fend
ing: a fleet into the Baltic. She oMerved that she had a fleet also,
which was fufficient to prff eft her.
In consequence of these advices, Stocks fell near one per cent,
although there was no open market.
The National Aflembly, it is said, have determinedâ" That
the King, by palling beyond the dillance of twenty leagues from
Paris, without the consent of the National Aflembly, had, ac
cording to a constitutional decree fan&ioned by himfelf, commit
ted a formal abdication of the Throne ; that he was declared to
be deposed ; that the Dauphin was entitled to the Crown, and
should govern under a commiflion of Regency, the members of
which would be appointed as soon as poflibJe ; and that his edu
cation should be superintended bv three Commiflioners, and by
visitors chosen by the National Aflembly."
The Dauphin is now in his seventh year, having been born

It was not believed, that M. D' Oilcans would have a (hare in

The Duke de Choifeul and Count Damas, who facilitated the
flight of the Royal Family, are aireited, and now in prison at
Verdun.
Colonel Frofen is arretted on a charge of having procured the
cairiagesand horses that conveyed the Royal Family out of the
capital. M. Thierry, the King's valet-dc-chamber, has disap
peared.
The King's departure from Paris was to have taken place five
days b.efore it actually did, and was delayed by his reluctance.
He was not prevailed upon to move at lafl but with much diffi
culty.
On the road he insisted on flopping four hours at one place for
refreftiment, to which the failure of the whole plan is attributed.
It was the current report, that the King asked La Fayette, 44 Are
the National AflVmbly and the people disposed to put us to death ?"
To which the Commander answered, " Sir, the National Alfem
bly, and the citizens, who tenderly loved you, commiserate the
situation in which you have plunged yourlelt ; but as to the Queen,
I am ft lent."
A gentleman just returned from Peterfburgh fays, that the re
ception which Mr. Fawkener experienced from the Czarina, and
the Ruffian Ministers, on his arrival, was not only the molt polite,
but the moll cordial that any of his predectffors ever met with at
that Court ; and at the time of his departure from that city it was
positively said, that the Empress had agieed to submit hcrfelf, in
the molt eanaid manner, to the mediation of the allied powers.
A plan for railing the Royal George was this day laid before

getting upon the ice.
Should a peace between Ruflta and the Porte be concludcd on,
the frelh bet ween the latter power and Aultria will ot
couiTe terminate ; and there is reason to believe that the King of
Ptuflia has undertaken to accommodate the bufmefs; as for this
purpose he has fetit Col. Bifchofiswerder to the Emperor in Italy.
The following is the copy of a letter from M. D'Orleans to the
printer of one of our newspapers, after the flight of the King
was known.
" Sir,
t{ Having read in your Journal your opinion on the measures to
be taken on the return of the King, and all that your justice and
impart allty have dilated refpetfcing me, I ought to r peal to you,
w hat I have publicly declared since the 21ft and 22d of this month
to several members of the National Aflembly, that I am ready to
serve my country, bv land or by sea, in a diplomatic capacity in
Ihott, in any post which r quirts bur a zeal and an unbounded de
votion to the public good ; but that it a legencv be the qu ftiou,
I lenounce from this moment forever, all rights which the confti
tin ion gives me to be elected to that office. Ido allure you, that
having marie so many facrifircs to the- interests of the people, and
the cause of liberty, I have not freedom in my own mind to de
part from the rank of a simple citizen, which I have adopted, bui
with a firm dererinination to remain forever in itâin conftqucnce,
ambition would in me be intxcufable. It is not tor the purpose
of filencingmy detractors, that I make this declaration. I knou
too well, that my zeal for the national liberty, and for equality,
â¢* hich is it s bafts, will ever heighten their hatred against me. I dif
iheir calumniesâmy conduct will ever prove the malignity
and the absurdity of them ; but on this occalioi., I ought to de

The affairs of France have long exhibited an intertfting fpe&acle
to mankindâthe friends of the human race have rejoiced in the
downfall of one of the most stupendous fabrics ever ere&cd by the
dempn of defpotifrn, and have earnestly wiftied to fee the glorious
temple cf freedom ere&ed on its rnins. The progress that has
been made in this great work, is truly allonifhing. At the present
moment a piinciplc of enthufisfm in the cause of liberty appears
to have taken poflTeflion of the minds of the great body of the peo
pleâand aÂ£luated by one impulse, in whatever shape or form the
ancient tyranny appears, it is instantaneously refilled.
The recent attempt of the King, and its consequences. exh'bit
the new character of the people in a most rtfpt&able point of
light. At the moment when a fele&ed body ot troops were called
upon to afliil in aiding the flight o! the King, their aims fell from
their hands ; and those whom it was expected would have been
the faithful adherents of the Monarch, were instantly transformed
into the guardians of the public fafety;-â-Well might Louis de
clare. that he was now convinced that the people were in favor of
the Revolution.
Tt is a pleasing reflection to every patriot that the laws of the
Union have not only retrieved <4ur credit as a nation, but have al
so placed the funds of every particular slate in a rtioft eligible litu
ationâa fituat on that was not anticipated by an individual in the
r 'nited States. And can it poflibly be considered as a criterion of
.pntriotifm to excite jealoufus and suggest suspicions refpe&ing the
teneial government ? Can those men be friends to the peace, the
â appinefs, the prosperity or freedom of their country, whose
whole merit as political chara&ers, arises from their secret and
â pen cabals this government and the present administration
Ii- the people know that thev cannot. >
The individual governments, and all the particular branches
nd members of them, niuft on every confident principle, be ftte
uous supporters of the government of the ; and this they
will do, for it is not pofHble that men in their senses should at
tempt to render useless the pillars that fuppoit the temple of our
unionâexoerience {hews that without a general government,
ftaies will destroy each other.
F.nvy is a mod fruitful source of complaint and declamation;
the Jjrofperity of our cotemporaries to be borne, unltfs we
have participated in their good fortune ; " it is by pruÂ£tifing the
arts of knavery and deceit that great estates are accumulatedâin
a fair competition, the abilities of mankind are so exaÂ£lly on a le
vel, that an equal diftrbution of riches must be the refult-âthere
fore we that are in the rear in the pursuit of gain, have not been
JairJs diflanced thus will the envious vent their spleen against
their more prosperous neighbors, and if it relieves their minds.
it may fervethe purpose of more just and liberal reflexions. There:
are methods however which the envious adopt to express their
chagrin and malice, which are not always so harmless in their ef
fectsâif in their great wisdom they can trace any connefton be
tween the fucceTs of individuals, and a just confidence in the go
vernmentâaltho this confidence was proposed to every citizen
without exception, the government forfooth must be traduced for
not making their fortunes, equally with those who embarked their
all on the ifTueof that contelt, which saved the liberties of Ame
ricaâa little attention to motives, will prevent a great deal of dc-*
ception.
