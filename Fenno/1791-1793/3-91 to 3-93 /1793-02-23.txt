A tal arul bodily uccomplifliments should

in ordinary cases, and is utterly inadni llibie.
1 he ravage state in which they continue is
no evidence of itâThat barbarism implies
any defect of natural capacity, the history of
Â«ll disprovesâThe Egyptians, iPerfians,
PhcMiicitns, and Chir.cfe, all which after'
wards became great and improved nations,
ere once barbariansâthey were even igno
rant of the use of fire, and of all the arts
>vhich are depsndanton it and eonnetfed with
; than which there can fcaicely be a more
deci&yc proof of their extreme barbarityâ
/id Z&C Yur-//iC 'Jthtto,
Saturday, 1 793'
The fame may be fa id of feveraj other nati
onsâeven the polite and polilhcd Greek % to
whom (through the medium of Europe) we
are indebted for all our knowledge, 44 descend
ed from savages, who wandered in the woods
and tields without laws and leaders, having
no other retreat but dens and cavernsâ"with
out the use of fire, or of food proper fov ll)en
ânay so ferocious as fbmetimes to each
other." Such was the 1 original stare of a peo
ple, de (lined to be the patrons and improvers
of the arts and sciences, and the admiration
of all future a^es âThere is not a trine per.
haps in America, whole rudeness equals thi s
descriptionâTheir barbarity, therefore, can
not be regarded in any degree as the fruit of
imbecility, either of mind or body. The enu
meration of the real causes which have hu
therto retarded the progress of civilization
among the Indians, with the measures which
appear to me most likely to accompliHi that
obje&, will be the subject of some future pa
pers.
In tW w~?cfr*tave. -.-rtajJ- -
ed the civilization of the Indian-, wc mult
not reft contented with a (ingle view of the
subject, but obfefve the force of all the colla
teral causes which may in any degree have
operated that erfeelâThe firft that I (hall
mention, is that which arises from 4< the few
and feeble exertions that have been made for
this purpose, the manner in which theft have
been conduced, and the langor with which
they hatfe been purfucd." The civilization
of a barbarous nation is difficult and labori
ous-âthe transition from the hnnter's to the.
pa (to i 1 a! life, afid thence to that of agriculture '
and coftimfcrce, is efte&ed by flow advancesâ
All changes indeed in t'ie habits and cuftonis
of a nation, mnft be made graduallyâmen
are attached to that mode of life to which
they have been accuttomed, and are aver e to
the idea of altering it ; the educati
on create a prejudice in favor of their own
state, and an i'r difference to othersâMen also
who are accuftrmed to perfect independence,
as is the cafe with all fa vage nations, tevolt
at the idea of furfenderirig their liberty to
the condition of law, or of submitting to any
kind of rcftraint. The an Twer of the ancient
Srvthians to the ambaflador of Menander the
greatâof Anacharfis of the fame nation to
Solon, and the avei fion of all savage nations
from adopting the arts and manners ofpolifli
ed life, evince the partiality they entertain
for their own condition, and their indifference
to the bleflings of improved societyâThe hif
torv and exper'ence of all agÂ£s, proves the
difficulty of bringing a barbarous nation to
the knowledge and practice of social duties.
Some centuries elapsed before the inhabitants
of ancient Greece were brought to any dfcgree
of civility. The fame may be said of many
other nations. Nearly four hundred years
are fuppo r ed to have pafled from Manco Ca
pac, the firft Inca and founder of Peru, to the
conquest of that country by the Spaniards.
Those sages who firft recovered men from
their wandering savage life to a fixed reft
dence, and inspired them with a raft e for the
enjovments of facial life, generally pretended
a million from a superior being, whom they
represented as the author and natron of that
manner of life and of blessings thev wish
ed to introduce.âAlmost ill nations, of whole
origin we have any diftinft: account, were
formed in this mannerâThe firft legislators
of the Cretans, Egyptians, Grecians, Locrians,
Ariniafpes, Getes, Romans and Peruvians all
pretended intercourse with some invisible
power, and a commiflion from himâThus,
by availing themselves of the ignorance and
credulity of mankind, and converting super
stition into an inftrumeut of policy, they ob
tained a ready reception to their inftru&ions,
and gave permanency to their establishments.

To Ph i'lo Dinc k n esâthe author of a piece, in
the Daily Advertijer cj Saturday laji.
Citizen Author,
I HAVE obfei ved your dirpofition to join
with me and other friends of democracy in
pointing out the macula which (with good glas
ses) may be discovered in a certain political
luminary. We think however, you direst
your Attention to a wrong quarter, and v. ifii
you to djre4 vour telescope to another limb,
where the dark spots of aristocracy are very
evident, and which will furni.li you with more
mat ter for aniinadverfion.
As to the negroes, you inuft be tender upon
that fubieiS âfor we think it is rather a mark
of modern democracy. It is certain that
Rome, during the republic, had abundance of
slaves, and that it was Kings who abolilhed
the practice. We have seen Stanislaus labor
ing to emancipate the (laves in Poland, and
Catharine bettering their condition in Rcffia,
âeven Louis the XVlth has figr.ed a decree
in favor of the negroes ; why then Ihnuld any
one ape such munarchual c onducft : Conduct
which would give great offence to some of our
best patriots. I ajfirin it, that the contrary
conoud is raoft like a good republican.âLook
305
about you, Citr/jcn ! Who talk most about li
berty and equa'ityâwho monopolize the vir
tue and fair it of America ? Who are the guar
dians of toe equal rights of* man? Is it not
those, who hold the bill ot* rights in one hand,
and a whip for t{*e affrighted (laves in the o
ther ? Are not Tome of our warmcft declaim
ers upon liberty, men who traHick in human
flefli and riot on the profits which a rife from
the sweat and groans of their Â»lufky brethren?
Mark their conduct, Citizen, and you will a
gree with us, that an eternal oppreflion of
these Wretched people, is very consistent with
the pure spirit of modern patriotism !
J n this therefore you were wrong ; but I
will point out proper subjects for your future
lucubrations refpe<fting the ar'iftocratical con
dutt of a certain great man. In the fnft
place, it has been a practice with divers
in order to *et through the multiplicity of
their business, to apportion their time, and do
all things with much regularity ; Aifred's
eronomy of time is well known : the late
King 6f Prulfia always retired early, and con
~ftaij.tly (even in his last fickoefs) role at four
in moÂ» ningr, employing himielf till f<roi.K
faft with his secret-aries, in reading petitions,
letters, learning the state ot the
Kingdom and dispatching the public business.
âWill you believe it, Citizen even
this symptom of monarchy is to be found in
this free country ! it is said that He alio re
tires at an early hourâthat the duties of the
day, with him, begin with the fun, and that
most of the public bufinefsis difpatcbed before
some of our democratic club are out of their
beds; to be Aire foiiie advantages may ari'e
from this, and the public business will never
get in arrear. But why should any one, at
feaSjfc this Angularity but from a love of mo
narchical manners ? and why (hould He not
rather copy certain young patriots, v/ho lye
in bed so long that they have not time to
comb their heads before they go to Congress ?
No- 11.
A fecoud mark of aristocracy is, that Hi
frequently goes to Church and even (hews a
refpe<ft for pious clergymen. I s not this aping
the conduct of many Kings of old, who were
devout worfliipp-jrsâ~nd in erfed copying after
Kinff David, who as the Puns ccnriune allures
us, was a crowded rascal. Is this, Citizen
Philo! is this the conduit of our modern pa
triots 1 those who adore liberty To muchâ-do
you ever fee thein adoring their maker ? Is
not infidelity a mark of what at present pailes
for good democracyâand does not a certain
Gazette frequently blend an outcry ef liberty,
with a sneer at religion ?
Yes, Citizen, until our rulers get rid of the
trammels of religion, .they will never be con
fide red by us, as free from the leaven of arii
tocracv
As to the clergy, I believe it can be proved,
that a certain pcrjon has been feet< in their
company and has ever been heard to speak
refpe&fully of them. A sue mark ot' an
aristocrat ! King-craft and Prieft-craft go
togethe) âand one ot our very patriotic mem
bers has-alreaÂ«ly intimated, that we fliall ne
ver do well, till we get rid of the clergy.â
The time for (hipping them off is not yet
come; bnt every man who does not lean to
â  arirtocracy, aiight to tefufc them counte
nance or fupportâ'Jti?ht to declaim ag&inll
| Prieft-crattâridicule the puritanical folly of
going to Church and Make these black coated
â  gentry, as poor as rats and a* (habby as a
tinged cat.
Thirdly, fti'ck to the fiibjeft oflevees ; it
}s ti'tie visit? of ceremony must be reccivfcd â
foreigners will to fee a man wiiofe ta
l&rtts and virtues have made his naThe deal*
through the civilized world.âCitizens will
croud to pay him refpeft, and rtiembers of
Co-VgreOi and public officers, think it but de
cent to jhetr re!peft't<> rHE man of the pko-
PL-k. But what then ! Alight he riot, Citiain
PhTto! to be visible at all Hours, and <>n all
davi, cJpecMly on Sundayt, when many of our
cliifrdon't know how to employ tileinffilves !
lfthi' perpetual Visitation did interrupt or
retard the public bulinels, would not that be
compensated by the irtfijfmation hr might gain
iu these very interesting and profitable visits;
Besides we could then call upon him, without
being put on a footing with new ptop/e, who
have started up like Jonah's gourd, and seem
to overshadow the ancient families of the Jo
minvn. But as things are managed, one may
be obliged to (land along fde of a man, whom
a few vears ago, no body knew. Another
thingâwhv should not, a? MiV*l*iui fays,
whv Ihould not our ruters go to the coffee
houfes? I never saw the Governor of Pen 11-
fylvania, or the Secretary of Stare, or mem
bers of Congress and other peat men frequent
these places, where they might pick up much
useful informationâat least about the price
of stocks and inohiTes ; indeed the beer lhops
might be a place still better, and vifitingthem
would evidence a more genuine democratic
spirit. I fay every great officer ought to
mingle with the people, and if he could not
find time in the day, he might keep o|>en
houfeat night and join with his fellow-citi
zenJ in a sociable game of wbift or all-fours.â
It certainly would oblige some of os, whose
i'ondsefs for that rational amusement is well
[Whole No. 3^9.]
known: hut it is confidently fai. J ., that card*
â¢are never permitted to be played in the rfo-;fe j
What Â«bOfft:iiab!e aristocracy and defpotifin is
this, in a free country !
Laiiiy you may obforve, Citizen Philo, that
there is great aristocracy in the preeminence
of his virtues.âHow is itâ .if,-he is not aim
ing at some higher r ank, that he continue*: so
unite in his favor the attachment and
of every hone ft mind ? How' is it that he has
twice been tbfc unanimous choice of three
millions of people ? And why is he not con
tent with a common (hare of public confi
dence. Such conduit is a snare for the liber
ties of our countryâHis very merit is dan
gerousâ*ind it is high time for America to
shew that republican ostracism which profew
cutes a man for the superiority of his worth.

This examination was undertaken at a con

that was once deemed incompatible with

MY mighty Genius! whatfo'er thou
Whether divifiV, Or hunftn, bird or beast!
For beast and bird,
Oft have I heard,
Great power pnftefs, and great sagacity, 5
And in a millstone far as man can fee ;
Witness that bird, by vulgars called, a Goose,
That, fquatirig near the wall,
Of Romeo's-great Capitol,
Which her enemies in ire 10
Coming to set.on fire,
Quicki\fmelt the Rat,
And wifely from her squat
His long neck ftretch'd, and round the City
spread the news
And stories like to this I think I've read, 15
Of beads too, but my head
Being full of greater things, I can't just now
The tales repeat, tho' there are such I know.
My mighty Genius! now I fay againâ
But for my wandering drain 20
I a(k your pardon, which I hope you'll grantâ
As well you know we men by Fancy's fire
Spur'd on, of words ne'er feel the want.
Nor like dull, fnail-pac'd Pedants, stick in the
mire,
But as our Fancy pricks our Nobs, we chant. 25
Oh ! thou who halt presided o'er my fate!
And got me wondrous honor trom the dale-
Yes ! wondrous honor ! for Ah ? who but thee,
Could ever have procured the feat lor me !
That feat which when my friend Oe-l-rs came, 30
He told me gave Ef quire to my nameâ
For thus he said, " Shquoire Shwânâk you'se
got in,
" Pyeturdty foteszt/idid de le&ion win."
Who? who but you with (kill and power so
fraught,
Could "e'er the Woodfawyers and Porters taught 35
To ast their part so wifely and so well,
And for my work theii votes so nobly fell ?
None! none but you ! I freely do confefs,
And you, my guardian Goddess, you alone I
bless!
Thanks to your magic arts, 40
Which, with my dinner and my wine,
Burst opc the gateway of the people's hearts,
And made them wholly nine!
Yet ah ! dear Goddess j leave me not I pray !
For should m) face, 4^
Bereft of thyfiveet grace,
By fad mischance betray my inward heart;
Much, much disgrace,
I fear, at next eleÂ£lion will take place,
In spite of all my cunning art, 50
And my dear honors shall be hifyd away.
Ah ! as the Bible fays, I teel
That prayer at ccrtain times is good ;
For now my blood
Creeps thio' my veins meandring like the eel; 55
And now like bottled beer it works,
And soon (hall drive the corks,
That all the paffcs stop.
Whererulhlike porter,fountains,infpiratiom, up.

Shall ru(h abroad, f
In founds as loud and fwectly fine,
As when the nine,
Beside Panaflus's hill,
Their voices join, 5^
And fingin concert with the Heliconian rill.
Or (hall I fay,
To give Imagination play,
Loud as o'er the wall,
The mill-pond waters roaring, floundering fall ?
Hark ! 'hark ! Tom !
Thou art great and glorious!
Hark ! hark ! Tom !
For thou art vittprious !
Thy enemies n&w may muster,
And threaten, and b1o(lÂ£r,"
But still our G-v-n-r thou (halt remain,
As long as I thy smile and nod can gain.

And such great Tom ! my art is, tho' a Poet,

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, February n, 1793,
In committee of the whole, on the report of
the Secretary of the treasury, relative to a plan
for the reduction of the public debtâ
Mr. Dayton in the chair.
The report being readâ
Mr. Giles adverted to the ImperfeA (late of
the information before the House, relative \o
the state oi the funds, particularly as the resolu
tions calling for this information had not yet
been complied with, and he was apprehensive
the requisite statements would not be furniflied
during the present feflionâThis being the state
of things, he thought the committee were not
in a fit uat ion to go into a difcuflion on the fub
jeÂ«fts ot the new loans, and new taxes, without
further light: he moved therefore that the com
mittee Ihould rife. This motion was seconded.
Mr. Fitzfimons was opposed to the motion ;
After briefly slating the importance of the fub
jedl, the general expe&ation of the people that
something would be done the present feffton rer
lative to a provision for reducing the public debt;
the duty of the government to avail itfelf of the
right reserved to it of paying off a part of the
debt; the ilate of the treasury ; the material in
formation already received from the Secretary ;
the atftual surplus in the treasury, &c. concluded
by faying, that he hoped the committee would
not rife, but go into a difcuflion of the fubje<sfc,
take up the proportions offered by the Secreta.
r y, and adopt or reje& them, as their merits
shall di&ate, or agree toothers which may. be
brought forward by any member of the com'
mittee.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) alluding to the speech of
the President of the United States, refpe&ing
this particular objed, and* the answer of
the House thereto, gave a short account
of the progress of business in the
House; it had been negle&ed ever since the
30th November, though the Secretary's report
has been in itspoffeffion ever since that period.
For the committee then to rife, would be tan
tamount to a relinquilhment of the objed the
present session. He dated several particulars to
shew that it was probable the existing funds
would be adequate to the objedfc in some degree,
without being obliged to have rccourfe to new
306-
taxes. He said, that he had been informed a gen
tleman of the committee had prepared some re
solutions relative to the bulinefs; he hoped
therefore, that the committee would not rife,
but that the gentleman would produce his reso
lutions; that the cemmittec would take them
into cpqf|c\eration, and at leall take fuc'n steps
in the business, as would manifeft some difpoli
tion to meet the wilhes of the people, and jufti
fy the profeflions made by so great a number of
the members of the legifLture.
Mr. Giles repeated his objedtions arising from
the imperfedfc state of the information before
the HouseâAdverting to th 2 Prelident's speech,
he laid, the propoiitions before the committee
were in diredl opposition to the peech. The
speech does not contemplate any faew taxes, but
the reverse. The proportions dire&ly propose
them. He was as much disposed as any mem
ber to go into measures for a reduction of the
debt, it was an object he much desired ; but he
called on gentlemen to lhew how this could be
done with any propriety, when the most import
ant and most neceiTary information refpeitmg
the funds is not in their pofleflion.
Mr. Lawrance adverted to the resolutions
brought forward a few days lince by Mr.Giles;
and going over them one by one, he aflced what
connexion the present fubjeft had with a folu
tipn of the principal part of the enquiries con
tained in those resolutions ? The most important
information expedted from the requisitions con
tained in the resolutions, he observed, was in
the poffeflion Â©f the House, particularly that,
which had any afpedl 011 the present business.
He was opposed to the motion for the commit
tee's riling.
Mr. Mercer said, he saw no good end that
would result from the committee's rising. Had
he the least suspicion that the project of the Se
cretary of the treasury would be adopted, he
would bÂ« one of the last that would ri e in fup
poi t of a mot/on to go into the difcuflion at the
present time ; but he had no such expe&ation.
He then entered into a consideration of the do
cuments before the Houfc, received from the Se
cretary of the treasury ; ne observed they were
inaccurate, defe<sfcive and imperfedt; they do
not furnilh the requisite information as to the
expenditures of the public monies which have
been already paid by the people. He (hewed the
impropriety of laying any new taxes until fatis
fa&ion was had relative to the sums already
paid; the people would not consider their inter
est consulted until this was done. He then urg
ed several reasons in favour of a poftponcmcnt
of a permanent provision for the reduction of the
public debt, till % more competent representati
on was on the floor; that it was extremely im
proper so the reliques of an imperfect represen
tation at the t'ofe of the feflion, to go into the
consideration of so important business. He pro
felTed his wishes that provision should be made
for the reduction of the public debt, and con
cluded by suggesting, that a temporary provi *-
on only, be made the present fefTion; further
than this he thought it would be improper to go
in the present state of affairs.
J. A. PANET.
Mr. Fitzfimons observed, that the gentleman
last lpeaking furniflied him with an opportunity
to suggest to the confidcration of the committee
some ideas he had revolved in his own mind, re
fpe&ing a temporary provision. He then port
ed out resources within the controul of the le
giilature, that might be applied to this objc<ft,
without recurring to new taxes, fpecifying the
sum that would be wanted to begin the operati
on, he mentioned a particular surplus, and the
bank dividend as being adequate to the obje<st.
Mr. Clark said, he wanted information as
well as the gentleman from Virginia; but he
saw no use in the committee's rising; they
would get up where they fat down, if they
(hould now rife. He wiflied the propositions
which had been mentioned were brought
forward, that they might be considered; but
there was another business which he thought had
a prior claim to attention, and that was the
debt due to the bank : in December that busi
ness was puflied with great zeal ; since that
time nothing had been said about itâthis ap
peared mysterious.
Mr. Lawrance rose to explain the late of the
business refpedting the debt due to the bank.
The fubjetffc had been suspended, in order that
the House might receive complete information
as to the state of the public funds.
Mr. Page offered some general remarks on
the report of the Secretary of the treasury,
which he said, was considered by many persons
as exceptionable in all its parts. He had his ob
je<stions to it. He wiflied the whole fubjedt to
revert tÂ© the consideration of the legislature, and
had therefore seconded the motion for "he com
mittee to rife, as the most delicate mode of giv
ing the business the go by.
Mr. Madison defended an observation brought
forward by Mr. Giles, which was that there
was a manifeft impropriety in bringing forward
abftra<st propositions for difcuflion, when it was
not known what consequences were involved in
the adoption of those propositions. Mr. Madi
son stated a variety of particulars to {hew that
such ab(lra& propositions are improper. He pro
feffed his wishes that some provision fhouldbe
made for reducing the debt; he believed his col
league was sincere in his profeflions to the
fame purpose. He recapitulated some of the ob
jections arising from the imperfedl Hate of the
information before the House.
Mr. Giles withdrew his motion ; his obje<st
in doing so was to give an opportunity for bring
ing forward the propositions which had been al
luded to.
Mr. Fitzfimon*, after offering some remarks
in answer to observations which had been made,
tending to impeach his consistency and sincerity
in the present business, read two proportions;
the purport of which is. That an annual fund
be conflituted, totonfiftof 103,199 dollars and
6 cents, to begin to accrue the fir ft Jan. 1793;
and that a loan to the amount of 550,000 dolls,
be made.

President of the United States to Congfefs of
the 14th of February 1791, on the fubjed of
the commercial intercoufe of the United States,
with foreign nations--which meflage had been
referred to him by the House.
The letter dates that a report on the fubjeA
is prepared, but suggests the idea of postponing
the confederation of it till the next session, on a,
supposition that in the interim, he may obtain
some information which would conduce to ren
dering a report on the fubje&, more compleat.
This letter was referred to a feled: committee,
confining of Meflrs. W. Smith, Giles, Lawrance
S. Bourne, and Baldwin.

mote the progress of ufeful arts, and to repea
the a& heretofore made for that purpose; an
an a<st to repeal part of a resolution of the ate
Congrels, refpe&ing the inhbaitants of 0
Vincennes.
In committee of the whole on the bill ceiV
ed from the Senate, entitled, An ail in ad ,noB
to and for amending the a<sfc, for extending tietim< limited sot fetling the accounts between
the United States and the individual Hates.
Mr. Dayton in the chair.
A motion was made to strike out the firft fac
tion of the billâThis fe&ion gous to repeal the
second fe&ion of tke former a&, which makes
the state of Vermont a party to the accounts be
tween the United States and individual states. In
fkpport of the motion it was said that Vermont,
participating in all the advantages of the inde
pendence of the country, and being a member
of the union, is justly chargeable with its quota
of all the expences that have been incurred; that
as on the one hand, were (fye a creditor state, ftie
doubtless would come in for her proportion of
the balances which (hall appear to be <iue from
the United States to the creditor states; so on
the other, if (he is a debtor state, it is but rea*
fonablethat ftie (hould be liable to pay her pro
portion of those balances; a contrary principle,
it was said, willencreafe the burthens of other
states. It was further said, that in all the great
questions relative to the finances and accounts
of the United States, the voice of Vermont has
had its proportional influence; and (he is there
fore on every principle to be considered as a con
stituent part of the union, and liable to all the
disadvantages resulting from the tonqe&ion.
In oppofftion to the motion it was said that
Vermont as a government bore her proportion
of the expences and facrifices of the war. She
was a frontier state, & only barrier between the
United States and Canada. Her exertions during
the war were made by her citizens alone, with
out afliftance from the other states. That in con
sequence of the peculiar confufions which pre
vai'ed in that state, the accounts of her Services
and fuppiies were left in a very deranged fitÂ»a
tionâ-That though the former a& allowed
17, months for her to bring in her claims, yet it
is said the other states have had a much longer
ume. fhat though it (hould be concluded that
Vermont ought to beconfidered as a part of the
confederacy prior to her adoption of the federal
eonftitution, the time certainly ought to be ex
tended for her to bring in her accounts. But it
was urged th.tt (he could not be so considered;
and therefore is not a party to the accounts, pri
or to that period. Since (he came into the Uni
on under the new constitution, (he has borne,
and will continue to bear her proportion of the
burthens of the United States, and will be oblig
ed to pay her proportion of the balances which
shall be found due from the Union. In answer
to the reasoning from her being represented on
the floor of Congress, it was said that the repre
sentatives of that state are representatives of the
Union; they a& in a legislative capacity, and
not as a committee of accounts.
The motion for striking out the I ft fe&ionwas
negatived. Some further amendments were mo
ved but difagrred to. The bill was reported with
out amendment. IntheHoufe Mr. W. Smith
renewed the motion for striking out the ift sec
tion, and called for the ayes and noes, which
wereânoes 39, ayes 17, as follow:

was read twice, and referred to a committee of
the whole House to-morrow.
In committee of* the whole on a bill for ex
empting from impost duties, ufeful beasts im
ported for breedâMr. Murray in the chair.
The bill being read, it was moved to add af
ter the words ,l for breed"âor on rags.
Mr. Livermore obje&ed to this motion. He
Observed that the objeA of the bill is to encour
age the importation of stallions, bulls and boars,
for the purpose of improving the breed of ufeful
animals. These, he said, ought to (land alone;
he thought it would be a very odd aflociation to
conned them with rags. Besides, said he, I d 0
not conceive there is any neceflity for bringing in
the article, for when the rage of calling for in
formation js abated, there will be such a dimi
nution of the business of printing, that he doubt
ed.not afufficsent quantity of rags might be ob
tained in the country by the paper-makers.
Other obje&ions were made by several mem
bers, and the motion being put, was loft. The
bill was then reported without amendment.â
Some verbal amendments were made in the
House. The bill was then ordered to be en
groflcd.
Mr. Barnwell laid the following motion on
the table:
Refohred, that a committee be appointed to
bring in a bill for altering the allowance to the
cpUcdors of impost and tonnage, so far a3 that
po colledor (hall receive more than per

li The year commenced in this part of the

to the Province. Some days frnce, a most
horrid plot was difcove ed (thro' the goodness

executed by a part of the Prince's regiment.
They were to kill him, blow up the Maga

Boston. The Magazine contained 4000 bar

have been increased by the deftfu&ion of the
whole city of Quebec, and perhaps not even

Robert Forfyth, Marshall.
Upon which the attorney general of the
United States, as counsel tbr the plaintiff,
grounded the following motion made on the
nth of August, 1792. 44 That nnlefs the
state of Georgia (hall after reasonable previous
notice of this motion, cause an appearance to
be entered in behalf of the said state on the
fourth day of the next term or fliall thenftiew
cause to the contrary, judgment shall be en
tered against the said state and a writ of en
quiry of damages fliall be awarded."
But to avoid every appearance of precipi
tancy, and to give the state time todeliberate
on the measures she ought to adopt, on motion
of Mr. Randolph it was ordered by the eourt
that the consideration of this motion ftiould be
postponed to the present term. Accordingly
on Tuesday the sth inft. the attorney general
proceeded to discuss the interesting qneftion,
" whether a state could be sued by one or more
individuals of another state and in an ar
gument of about two hours and a half, ably
supported thÂ» affirmative-fide of tlie queltion
âWhen Mr. Randolph had closed his speech,
the court after remarking on the importance
of the fubjeft now before them, and the ne
ceffitv of obtaining every poflible light on it,
exprefled a wifli to hear any gentleman of
the bar, who might be difpoled to take up the
gauntlet in opposition to the attorney general.
As 110 gentlemen however were so dilpofed,
tlie court held the matter under advisement
until Monday the 19th inft. when, in presence
of a numerous and refpeftable audience they
feverallv declared their opinion on the ques
tion that had been argued.
Judge Iredell was firft called on by the chief
jufticefor his opinionâln an argument of
one hour and a quarter, he maintained the ne
gative of this question ; he considered the
states as so many separate independent sove
reignties. He relied much on the books of
Englilh jurisprudence in proof that no sove
reign could now be sued unless with confer,t
of the fameâHe was aware that the states
had transferred certain prerogatives of their
sovereignty to the United State-,, but what>
ever tliey had not clearly transferred were
certainly retainedâthe right of commencing
a suit against the states he did not think clear
ly veiled in the government of the United
States, nor recognized by the judiciary law
palfed in pursuance of the article of the
constitutionâJudge Iredell referred to many
authorities, and 011 a variety of grounds de
clared his opinion to be agaiuft the motion of
the attorney general
Judge Blair thought the question turned
wholly on the word'! and intention of the con
stitution, and of the judiciary lawâhe regard
ed the spirit but more particularly the plain
and.obvious meaning of the words in this light
âhe was fatisfied that this court had cogni
zance of actions against states, at the suit of
individuals, and he thought the provifioi. in
the constitution wife, and promotive of the
general good of the people of the United
Statesâhe was averse from the court a (Turn
ing powers which did not fully belong to it;
but he thought he ihould betray the ge
neral interests if he did not lend his aid in
support ofthe real jurifdi&ion of the court.
On the wholÂ« he was clearly and decidedly
in favor of the motion of the attorney general.
Judge Wilson next took a very broad and
enlarged view of the question, which he tho't
would again resolve itfelf into a question of
no less magnitude than whether the people of
the United States formed a nation. He exa
mined the fubjeft by the great and general
principlts of law and jurifprudence,by the laws
and usages of nations, and by our own consti
tution and the judicial law of the United
States,. His argument was elegant, learned,
and contained principles and sentiments high
ly republicanâ!t occupied one hour, and con
cluded pointedly and unequivocally for the
motion of Mr. Randolph.
Judge Cufhing confined himfe'f to a narrow
compass, to the constitution and laws of the
United States; his argument was fiiort but so
lid and judicious. He saw no room for doubt
but fanftioned by his opinion that of his two
brethren who had immediately preceded him.
Chiefjuftice Jay delivered one of the most
clear, profound and elegant arguments per
haps ever given in a court of judicature; he
took a view of the United States previous to
the late revolution, when we were the fub
jefts "f a sovereign; after our independence
he considered the people as becoming indivi
dually so vereign. In this capacity they form
ed the present government; be then examined
the reafbns of adopting the present constitu
tion as expreflVd in the preamble to the fame;
he examined the distribution of powers which
they had made in this instrument, more par
ticularly those of the judiciary department,
among which he was clearly of opinion, was
that of compelling the of a state
in the supreme eourt of the United States,
even at the suit of an individual of another
state; he commented on the wisdom and found
policy of this arrangement, and concluded
in faror of the attorney general's motion in
the pre'ent cause.

ID
DECEIVE tbe gratulations of a heart
Unknown to fcrvile adulation's art;
A Heart that Virtue loves, and loving her,
Mud ever love thee, Vice'* Conqueror.
Tho' strong, yet gentle is thy generous mind.
And long confefs'd the friend ol all mankind;
Tho' great thy toils in war to set us free
From Britiih chains, and give us Liberty ;
Yet thro' some breaib such blood degenerate
flows,
Those who were brethren once, are now thy
While yet thy fame hut equal'd their's they grew
Impaflion'd with thy worth, and praises due
To thy great merit liberally bestowed,
Yet as we knew paid only what they owed.
But those who fee the subtle aits that dwell
In haughty fouls, that with ambition swell,
Know that in praising you, they gave to praise
What in themselves they tho't deferv'd the bays.
For while your fame assumes a bolder flight,
And rising, spreads around a stronger light,
(As when a blazing ball whirls high in air
Its sparks more bright and glorious appear)
By malice struck, they lift their scowling eyes,
And ft ill purfuc thee, but with envious cries.
Yet,WASHi ncton ! be firm,complete thy plan,
Undaunted, still remain the friend of man ;
For Wisdom speaks this truth, round Virtue's
gate
The howling whelps of Envy ever wait.
COMMUNICATIONS.
Peace ftould be the wish of every benevo
lent heart. War throws mankind bick in
their projjrefs <if improvementâ.it ii
my to the happiness of the human rar/e. But
ifwarfliould spread in Europe, ar\d Gieat-
Britain engage in ir, it is happy for America
that we are at liberty to remain fit peace
Let others fightâpeace and profperitv are
companions and fellow travellers. It be
hpves our government to ta'/e care that our
fiery spirits are kept in rjftraintâleft the
raflinefs of individuals ihovild involve the na
tion.
Half the trouUes and altnoft all the quar
rels that vex human life tyring rather from
little ill humours that ought to be governed
and sweetened, than from any real adve-fity.
We make or mar our own hippinefs. This
being true, it only remains for those who
would breed dlfcontents among the people to
watch for little thing'sâfor flight events that
stir the fretfulâthat alarm the timid, or that
irritate the proud and envious. Thus by
negle&ing nothing, they may accomplish
every thing. But why lhould they do
this? it will be demandedâArfvcr, to
get cbofen into Congrefn. Many indeed are
hunting finaller game. It is more proper to
fay, they are kept for their barkingâand the
expedled reward is, to get the bones when
their masters shall lie seated at the table.
Mr. Fen no,
P leaje to publijk the following Impromptu, J*om

THE Secretary makes reports,
Whene'er the House command him ;
But, for their lives, some Members fay
They cannot understand him.
In such a puzzling cafe as this,
What can a mortal do ?
'Tis hard for one to find reports
And under {landings too.
The Senate of this state, on Tuesday last,
palled a resolution, for the appointment of a
Federal Senator, by joint vote of both houfqs.
The resolution will, no doubt, be concurred
in by the house of Representatives.
