But, Gentlemen, how noble is the thought,!
how condolatory the reflection, that after youj

the accused ; a trial by another jury of his fel

with the right and the opportunity of summon
ing wiueffes for his defence, with the right al
so, in capital cases, of peremtorily challenging a
large number of thejurors, called upon his trial,
(in treason thirty-five, in other capital offences,
twenty) accompanied also with other privile
ges, 1 believe never granted in the fame ex
tent in any other laws, the having delivered
not only a copy of the indictment and a lift of
the jury, ar.il witnesses in prosecutions for
1 reason, but a copy of the indictment and a
lift tifi-J'.-j Jury, in other capital prosecutions, a

trealon and mifprifion of treason, a',l thele ad
vantages exirt in England, in their fuileft ex-
Fai: in all other capital cases, (aftoniih
'"g as it is) at tliis very dav, in that enlighten
ed country, counsel are not allowed to speak to
_ any but questions of law, and it is considered a
I' matter of favor in the court, to permit them
even to alk queftlons for the prisoner. It is
, ind.isd a mod melancholy consideration, that
loiv aiter liberty had been contended for, and
to a gi'-at degree obtained, as to other objetts,
tii? personal fafety of individuals fliould have
been so little regarded. It was thought to re
quire laws in England, fame years after the re
volution, in :688 (one indeed even so lata as
Queen Anne) to entitle a prisoner to have wit
nen examined 011 oath, in his defence. Ac
cording to an iniquitous practice originally in
troduced, as there is great reason to believe,
without any colour of law, prisoners had nor
only been excluded from this privilege, but al
io from being allowed a full defence by counsel;
and this unprincipled practice had so long pre
val' 11 t'j; it at length acquired the pretext of
on bni'nnnouiitable prescription. Happy are
that p.eopie whole liberties depend, not on the
mercy or discretion of courts, but 1 pon written
provilions, too plain to be misunderstood, and
protested in the most sacred manner, by guar
dians too watchful and too powerful tn be over
come !
tenk
The Constitution itfelf, together with amend
ments to it, which have received the requisite
consent, secure the invaluable benefits I have
mentioned, of a trial by jury, of a public trial
in the face of the ncufed, of having precefs- for
witnefles, and the assistance of counsel. The
other advantages enumerated, form part of the
Criminal Code, derived from the Legillature
alone,,and partake of that discerning zeal, for
the real security and true happiness of ali the
citizens, which lb eminently diftinguifli a Go
vernment, founded on the very basis of freedom
aVid ju-ftice.
Another protection, gentlemen, in laws whose,
spirit of mildness and liberality we cannot 100
much admire, is a limitation of time for the
pFofccution of, offerees. No capital o&nce
(murder or forgery excepted) is to be profecu
ted but within three years after the commiflion
of it, nor any prosecution for any oil . nce not
capital, or for any fine or forfeiture under any
1 penal statute, but within two years after the
i commiifion of the offence, or the incurring of
the forfeiture. There is an exception, how
ever, in both inftauces, of persons fleeing from
j oft ice. This also, in its extent, is an improve
ment, I believe, on former systems.
The crimes, gentlemen, of which you are to
enquire, are crimes committed aÂ«ainft the
United States within this diftrift. These are
defined and the punishments prescribed, in cer
tain a&s ofCongriifs, pal Ted in virtue of pow
ers contained in the Constitution of the United
States. They will be found, I trust, all of them
congenial to the spirit of a free people, the
principle of whose aim it invariably is, and
ought to be, to unite all the energy necessary
for the support of Government, with an inflex
ib!e attention to the proper security and pro
tection of individuals. It does not appear to
! me material now to point them out particular
ly to von, not only because I presume you are
. we 1 acquainted with riloft if not all of them, and
can have easy access to them, but because I
have reason to hope you have no occasion at
this time to present many, if any particular j
offences- The very favorable accounts I have ;
every where heard, since I have had the pleasure
of being on this Circuit, of the good order and
refpecVful fubiniiHon to the laws which univer
fillv prevail in it, have given i;:e the utmost fa
tiÂ«fa.ftion. In addition to my own personal ob
fervati<i>ns, they have imprefTed me with the
highest refpeft for a people who have bad the
good i'enfe so happily to combine an invincible
spirit of freedom, with an enlightened regard
for such a government and such laws ,as car
alone be adequate to secure it. May this ex

FROM THE AMLRH AN DAILY ADVERTISER-
J MR. Dunlap,
j Pe p/e.ifeJ to ivjert the fallowing, as a Supplemental
I Aote to No. 11, in your paper of the 10th itiji.
i "\/\7" HEN tlie ext'afts explaining Mr. JefFer
j V V fun's political principles, refpefting the
i constitution, were sent to the prefÂ«, with an
Intimation that" the originals fiiould be made
acceflible if necefTary, it was with reason con
cluded that no man of candor would entertain
any doubt of their authenticity A writer, un
der the fignatnre of Catullus (who, notwith
standing his ridiculous transfer of his author
ship, is evidently the original writer under the
signature of An American) has beep To far want
ing in this virtue, as to contradict so rational a
supposition. To put an end to all possible ca
vil on this fubjeft, notice is now given, that
any gentleman of known honor and delicacy
who (hall be named to the Editor of the Ame
rican Daily Advertiser, fliall have an opportu
nity ol exair:tiling not only the passages ettrzfl
ed, but the entire contents of the original let
ters. It fortunately happens, that irom <\e
writer's practice of mentioning in every letter
the date of the preceding one, it is demonstra
ted by the letters themselves thattheyform the
whole of this correspondence within the i "f
---lary period. The propriety of requiring u âit
nefs in this cafe of the above description ac
counts for itfelf. In the freedom of iin exteiir
five correspondence with a confidential friend,
it could not but happen that many things must
be included not only irrelative to the fubjeft in
question, but to any other of a pnblic nature,
and which though unexceptionable in their
place, fiiould never leave the depository of
private honor. With refpeft to the letter of
July 6, 1788, publiihed in your paper of the
10th instant, this sagacious commentator has
been as unlucky, as in all his other inferences
from presumptive aircumftances. It is neither
the letter spoken of by Mr. Pendleton, nor
written to the fame person. Had the critic,
however, been possessed of less sagacity, with
âthe smallest particle of candor, lit- might eafilv
have reconciled the statement given by Mr.
Pendleton with the extra# in question. The
bill of rights mentioned in the latter might
surely be called, either by Mr. Jefferfon, in ano
ther letter, or by Mr. Pendleton, stating, in
his own language, the contents of the one he
saw, an enumeration of the amendments wish
ed to be secured. Every particular right secu
red is, in fact, an amendment, ar.d is so desig
nated in the amendatory supplement to the con
stitution. It is painful to wafle a moment in
explanations which seem to be so unnecelTary ;
yet, as a fpeeimen of tie manner in which the
attack on an illustrious patriot is cpndudted, it
may not be unworthy of attention.

BRUSSELS, August 24.
MLa FAYETTE was taken in the
. following manner :âOn the
19 th, St ten in the evening, a pat role,
confining of seven men, belonging to
the advanced porta of Rochefort, in
Ardennes-, in the Bifhoprick of Leige,
where M. Harnoncourt commands,
met with a number of French officers,
followed by about twenty domestics.
They were on the point of being 6r
ed at by the picquet guard, but in
stantly one of the strangers quitted
his company, and was conduced to
M. Harnoncourt.
This |eai!cman wag M. Bureau de
Pufy, officer of engineers. He de
clared that his friends and himfelf
were French emigrants going to Hol
land. M. Ramoncourt asked
how it happened that they were not
going to join the Princes ? M. Bureau
answered, that, differing in opinion
ifromtherS, they preferred going to
! Holland. M. Harnoncourt told him,
[that they mull te ffeated as prifon
|ers of war. Not one of the whole
company objected to giving hi* pa
role, except M. Alexander Lametb,
who began a fine speech on the rights
of nations, and fa id that they were
arvefted in a neutral country. They
were then on the territories of the
principality of Leige. M. Harnon
court anfwered,tbat the French had
been so extremely clever in confound
ing all kinds of rights, and the rights
of nations in particular, that it wasHO WQfcder if mistakes (hoold be ihc
confe<justice. i M. de Lametb threat

M. la/ayette h*d attempted to found
the dispositions of his (o)diers, and j
finding that they had refulved to l
*ihoot him, and being desirous hiinfelt
â of living a little.longer, he took the
firft opportunity to pnfs into an ene
niy's country.
Every day fre(h prisoners are bro'c
to Luxemburg. On the evening
previous to the raising the camp at
Montfort, 38 French prisoners were
â conducted to it, that the Prufiians
might fee them. Among these were
fix peasants. The Duke of Brunf
wick sent for them, gave them a fe-
Trere reprimand, and lent theiu back
to their own country
The Pruflian army having, on the
Bth in raised the camp
it Monrfort, marched four leagues
awards tilt French territories, and
rfFe&ed a jon&ioil with the army ot
general Clairfayt. These combined
forces encamped the fame evening
on the French territories, at two
leagues distance from Thionville ;
their right extending as far as Long
â¢wi. The king of Prufiia slept in the
Chateau de Bettenburg, only . one
league distant from the French fron
tiers.
On the 19th, 18 waggon loads of
bricks were carried from Luxemburg
to Greven maker, to build ovens with,
'and to make a Boulangerie de Cam
pagne,
Letters received from Luxemburg,
lated the 20th instant, inform tisrhat
he fortrefs of Longwi is taken by tlie

another letter we i ave the following
details :â" The intention of the ar
my was to scale the place ; but be
fore preparations for that pnrpofe
could be made, the garrison, whose
answer to the firft summons was, that
every man was resolved to be buried
under the ruins of the fortrefs, sur
rendered without attempting to make
the least defence ! They were all
made p>ifoners of war ; they were
in number 1800, and were conducted
to Luxemburg. The Prussian Bou
langeries were immediately removed
to Senger. The troops are in full
march to meet M. Luckner, [now
Kellerniau] who is encamped with
25,000 men, under the walls ofMetz.

of which the followingis an abltratft:
The cominiflion affesnbled duringthe
suspension of the night fitting, being
informed by several citizens, that the
people were continuing to rush in
great tin tubers towards the different
prisons, and were there exercising
their vengeance, they thought it ne
cessary to write to the council gene'-
ral of the community, in order that
they might learn officially the true
ftaie of things. Hie community feni
back word, that ihhey had ordered
a deputation to go, and give an ac
count to the cominiflion of what had
happened. At two o'clock the depu
tation confifling of Meflis. Tallion
Tronchon, and Cuiraut, were intro

*1. Trouclu.ll then said [hat the great
er part of ihe prisons were empty â¢
that about hundred prisoners
had been maflacred ; that he had
thought it prudent to release all pri
loners confined for debt at the prison
of La *01 ce, and that he had done
the lame thing at St. Pelagie. That
vhen he returned to the community
be recollected that he had forgot to
visit that part at La Force whe. e the
-women were confined , ,hat he i m .
mediately returned, and set at liber
ty twenty.four. That h e and his
colleagues had taken under, heir par

The very interefling news from

that of the 10th of Augult, for in

but totally mifreprelented, for the

to make the National Aflembly unpo

LONDON, September 8
The withdrawing of our Ambada
dor from Paris in the present mo
ment was a matter of mere etiquette ;
but to order hftli to deliver suchÂ« note
on his departure, is viewed by everv
liberal politician sn this country, not
merely as an insidious act, unworthy
of a manly people, but as an unwite
measure, calculated to involve us dan
gerously with Franceâdangerously
we mean as to our permanent in
terefls.
Jt is mentioned at Valenciennes, as
a. blocking p'<iof of La F.ayecre's Trea

accusations are quickly multiplied.

ftatc .-.s at pret?nt; the increase of people, rich
es, and agriculture is ahnofl incredible, except
to ttfofe who are eye-witneiles of ir. The pre
sent? war with the Indians has for a while flop
ped emigration to the western territories ; and,
from, the influx of Germans, French, liifli, &c.
tne scheme for deepening rivers, cutting canals,
r^akinÂ«.roads, &c. which twelve months ago I
thought impoifible to be accompli flied for ages,
is now in such lorwardnefs, that I believe this
â State v ill, in the course of 12 or 15 years, be
in a* good a situation, in this refpecH, as England:
as our Aifembly spares no expence, but is liber
al in encouraging these improvements.
u We have at present a profpedt of a good
harvest. Some few manufactories have been
attempted to be erected in this State ; but from
the high price of wages, the great plenty of
provisions, and above all, the cheapnels of land,
tbey do not succeed excepting those for bulky
articles, the ra>v materials of which are cheap,
and the expence of bringingoverheavy.
" The leather manufactory, for instance, is
in a fiourifhing liate ; a good raw hide can be
purt Mted in our market for 2s. (it is not long
jince toe flelliers gave as much to carry them
uff; litrS oak and bark can,be had for a trifle ;
yet the fanners are obliged to pay luch high wa
ges to their men (from 7s. to 9s. sterling pr. day)
that Brftifli leather is often imported in such
.quantities, as to Have -necefiitatfed the tanners
here to apply to Congress for relief. Congress
have increased the duty on leather, and on ar-.
tides made of it, from 3 or 4 to to per cent.
44 The paper-mills, manufactories, and hea
vy iron goods flour: Hi belt. Glass hou'es and
manufactories of stone ware are increafijjg.
" But all our manufactured goods are a
mere trifle to what are imported from Great-
Britain and I.relaird. To the south of Virgi
nia, no article however bulky or coarse, is ma
nufattured; every thing ulcd there is imported
from Great-Britain, or the northern States."
A correfpom! >Nt who has read the
Proclamation and a letter ligned A. J. Dallas,
informing the public 44 that tflere are rejects
in the return*', but that it pearly appears from
injormat TGXurfis that the omitted votes wouid
not alter the Hate of the election," requeits an
ar.lwer to the following queries : lit, "Whether
the writer of that letter ir, the lame gentleman
\vho was a member of the committee of cor
respondence ? 2d, Whether ffte power to jud,e
in the aboveraentioned ca.'e is vetted in mn or
in the House of Representatives ot the United
States ?,,
Several citizens vequeft to know whether
there is not a variation between tile Gover
nor's Proclamation and his Secretary's
the one lets forth jthat by virtue of the law
requiring lum after receiving the returns to
pubhlh the namesâhe therefore declares t<je
ibverai person", fluiy elected from the ix ur:::,
which muit ofcourfe mean all the return* : Where
as the other tells us that all the returns we. e
not received, but that it clearly appealed (to
the writer of"the letter, I ftippoie) that the fupr
prefTed returns would not change tiie election.
Tiiey request further to be informed whether
in iucli a cafe the Houie of Representatives of
the Uniied States, can alone decide that tlÂ»e
fuppreflcd votes would not vary the state of the
Poll, or whether it is left to the Governor or
j his Secretary to judge of the election I

Refpcflfully submits to the Citizens of the United
States, the following
PROPOSALS
fop jÂ»u or T 9.i* * tfO B* r .Â»Â»Â»csi" ric^,
An AMERICAN EDITION of
Guthrie's Geography
IMPROVED.
Of which theft arc the terms :
1. TT shall be published in 48 weekly numbers,
JL each containing three (heets,or twenty-four
pages, of letter press, in quarto, printed with new
types on fine paper.
11. In the course of ihe work wi|l be-delivered
about thirty Urge maps, of the fame fisc Â»s thofc
in the European editions, viz. most of them ftieet
ttnaps on post paper.
(Â£3T Bef/des the maps in the Britijh editions, this
work will curtain maps of as many of the United States
as can he readily procured, executed by the beji engrav
ers in the United States.
111. The price of each number will be a quar
ter dollar, to be paid on delivery. No ad
vance required.
IV. The woik will be put to press as soon as
yooVopies are fubferibed for.
V. Sub(cKibei's who disapprove of the work, on
the publication ol the three fiiftnumbeis, are to
be at liberty 10 return thetn, and shall have their
money repaid.
VI. The fubferibers* names fliall be prefixed as
patrons of the undertaking.
Perhaps there is no science more entertaining
and ufefubthan geogiaphy. It reveals the disco-
Meries ,of travellersâthe remarkable curiofitics of
all countries, in nature and artâthe situation ot
provinces, cities, towns, villages, livers, & moun
tainsâin,fine, the history, manners, customs, laws,
forces, revenues, and government of different na-
tions.
It is an old observation, that li there is not a
son or daughter of Adam, but has some concern
with geography and that a knowledge of this
science rs indtfpcnfable towards the lludy of his
tory with advantage or fatisfa&ion. Indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannot dtfcourfe on the
most common newspaper topics of the day without
betraying his ignorance.
So much for geography generally. With rc
fneft to the present plan, let it fufftce to remark,
that Guthrie's Geography ha> been long acknow
ledged to be the best in ihe Engiifh language :
however, the account of America in it has, from
obvious reasons, been very erroneous and defec
tive. The errors of former editions will be cor
rected, and the defers fupplicd, by gentlemen of
abilities, who have engaged to fuperimend this
undertaking, and to avail themselves of all the in
formation that cftn be procured, to lender it the
most complete edition extant.
The Pi inter t ameitly solicits the support of his
fellow-citizens throughout the United States : and
as no deposit is requited, and every fubferiber will
be at liberty to withdraw his name, if, on trial,
he (hould dilapprove of the work, he hopes the
friends of science. and of Ameiican arts and ma
nufactures, will'cheerfully and eaÂ»ly patronize this
ufefnl work, the gieateft and most expensive, pro
bably, ever yet attempted in America, in the typo
graphical line, the Encyclopedia excepted.
