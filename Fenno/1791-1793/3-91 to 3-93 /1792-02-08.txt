FROM A VIRGINIA PAPER
LEGISLATURE OF GEORGIA
ON the ryth of December the Senate after
having examined into the several charges a
gainst Judge Olborne, pronounced him guilty,
as follows :
Whereas Henry Ofborne, Esquire, one of the
judges of the Superior Court of the State of Geor
gia, hath been impeached by the Honorable the
House of Reprel'entatives before the Senate of
the said State, and in General Assembly met ;
the Senate having heard evidence in support of
the said charges, and on hearing argument, as
â well on the part of the prosecution, as on the
part of the said Henry Ofborne, and taking the
premises into conflderation, do find the said Hen
ry Ofborne, one of the judges of the Superior
Court, GUILTY of the firft, second, third, fifth,
and sixth articles of impeachment against him.
The Senate do find the said Henry Ofborne not
guilty of the fourth articlc against him. And
for the offences whereof the said Henry Ofborne
is declared guilty, this High Court, founded on
an express article of the Constitution of the State
of Georgia, doth award and adjudge.
First. That the said Henry Olborne fliall be no
longer'one of the Judges of the Superior Court
of the State of Georgia ; and that his naine be
struck off the lift of Justices in Cambden county.
Secondly. That he (hall be incapable to hold
any office of trust, honor or profit, iVÂ» this State,
for thirty years
Thirdly. That his name ftioll be struck off the
roll of the attornies at law.
Fourthly. That he shall pay the sum of fix hun

On the 23d of December, both Houses of As
fembly of that state came to the following refo-
Jution :
Refotved, That the approbation and thanks of
this Legtflatnre be communicated to Gen. James
jackson, a Representative from the county of
Chatham, for his exertions in bringing forward
to public investigation an attack on the liberties
and privileges of the citizens of this Hate, in the
last election for a member to represent this (late
in the Cotigrefs of the United States.
The conducft of the citizens of the State of
Georgia, in thus punishing an officer who had
made so nnjuftifiable a life of his appoiniment,
deserves to be highly applauded by every friend
to his country. This noble example will prove
to our rulers, that the people watch with due
circumfpetftion, their rights and privileges, and
that they are at all times ready to step forth in
defence of them.

By a letter from a gentleman at St. Paul's Bay,
to a refpec r table mercantile house in this city, we
are favotctl with accounts of a diftrefling ten
dencyâ Ihe 6ih inft. a shock of an earthquake
was felt, and between that and the 15th (the
date of the letter) 29 (hocks more were felr, 9 of
which were very severe, and did considerable da
mage to feveial houses, the church, &c. It ob
liged the inhabitants to quit their honfes very
often, feai ful of their falling every moment, as
nothing lei's could be expetfed. At the time of
the gentleman's writing the account, lie felt two
lhocks more ; a poor female loft her senses by the
frightâthey did not hear of any lives being loft,
buc the people were in a state of apprehension
for other quarters.
FROM THE QIJFEEC HERALD.
MONODY
Alas, where wish for I have Jlray'd
/ can wander with pleasure, alone !
LEAVE me, my friend, the wild fequefter'd wood,
The melancholy brook, the whifp'nng wind,
The plaintive linnet's Â«ote,* and solitude
Suit bcft the tender anguifhof my mind,
Nor wonder at my choicc, if fond I stray,
Refign'd to thought, beneath the lonelv grove ;
Absent and dull I lounge among the g a y;
Their jokesdifpJeafe,âmy heart is with my love.
Would'ft thou with friendly conveife sooth my cÂ«re,
Praise the mild azure of my Delia's eye;
Dwell on the loften'd graces of my faii%
Nor call it affe6tation, if I sigh.
Her foft, expressive, melting eyes bcfpeak
A foul as gentle as her acccnts How ;
Mild is the dimple on her crimlon cheek,
Her auburn trefles shade a neck of snow r
Tall Chines thcgrsceful maidâyet ?b desist,
In pity cease to praise the matchlcfs fair ;
You nurse the anxious sorrows of my breast.
And only plunge me deeper in despair.
In silence oft, and with a ftifled sigh,
An humble tender glance I fond have stole ;
if I met her foul fubduiog eye,
Let lovers tell the transports ot my foul !
I thought (be pity'd meâah fool, the while !
Her lovely eyes a thousand hopes can move ;
Despair is banifh'd by her beauteous smile ;
And ah, how talfe a flatterer is love !
Here muting, let me pass my penfiveday ;
Disturb no more, my friend, the sacred fliade ;
For here. *n happier hours, she deign'd to stray,
Each objed round recalls my fav'rite maid.
On this green bank, where once her limbs reclin'd,
Romantic let me sigh mv hours away,
And in fond raptures gladly call to mind.
The gentle things my charmer deign'd to fay.
Ah whv thy melancholy friend persuade
The dull, unfeeling revellers to join ?
To quit the image of the beauteous maid.
And drown my cares in turbulence and wine ?
I hate such gross debarments of the foul,
Such falfe, unfteadv joys I scorn to prove ;
Full well thou know-'ft 'he magic of the bowl ;
And wine deceives and flatters more than love.
Haft i-hou iy>t seen a veteran profound
In drunken ostentation count his fears,
Hisflufh'd companions nodding ail around,
Tir'd with a long detail of endless wars ?
His u-nprais'd arm would many a hofl engage
Down it deeendsânor e'en the table spares
Then, with a (VgH, wc pity'd prating age,
And loft the reverence due to silver haits.
Haft thou not seen, deceiv'd by fraudful wine,
In felf conceit and nauseous bumpers drown'd,
Ten orators, at dnce, attempt to (hine,
And sputter nonfenfeand confufion round ?
The foul, rrrijlrujtirtg, ajks iftkifbe joy /+
Such groveling scenes are poor relief for sorrow ;
E'en while falfe hopes his heated mind employ,
Each bloated caitiff trembles for to-morrow.
Say, ftiouid I quit love's pure, refining sway,
To claim a despicable drunkard's praise ?
As soon I'd change the morning'schearful ray
For the dull crackle of a stubble blaze !
Rut flattering love ill can mv foul withstand ;
My Delia's eyes inspire a brighter flame;
The *rntleft preffureof her lilly hand
Thrills with ethcrial transport through my frame.
F.'lacious Love, thou dear deluding pwwer,
Soften her tender bosom while I sigh ;
Or change my being to a vernal flower,
Plac'd on her breast to taste of blissâand die !
Fancy, be itill ! ah why increase my pain ?
Why fondly dwell, invidious on her charms ?
Why aid Dlspai r to paint some happier swain
Clafp'd to her breast, and folded in her arms ?
And felf tormenter, Envy, shun mv breast
Whate'er my fate, be this my conftaint pray'r ;
In all her wilhes let the maid be blcft,
And be her life as happy as she's fair !

PARIS, O&ober 26
THE Archduke and Council ot Brabant have
lately taken the most decided and even vigo
rous nieafures againfl the refracftory Hates ; as
they give room for apprehending serious conse
quences, and are even considered as 011 the eve of
a declaration of hollilities. ,
The minister at war has given a farisfaftory
account to the national afl'embly of his condudt
with regard to the four soldiers who are detain
ed in prison notwithstanding the amnelty. It
appears that the non-conforming priests are in
force in several of the provinces. At St. Pierre
le Bonne, they appeared at the head of five hun
dred peasants, and plundered the church of the
holy utensils, &c. &c.

Mr. Hooft, the patriotic Burgomafler,and one
of the 1110 ft diftinguifbed of the Dutch refugees,
has been insulted in a very violent manner ac
Deventer, and conduced out of the town amid
the abuse and pelting of the populace, who filled
his carriage with mud. The government are
fufpecfted to have countenanced this proceeding
from political motives.
In the department de l'Orne, the refradtory
priefls have attempted to make themselves mas
ters of the parifti church of , by force of
arms. This sedition has been quelled by the
good eonduil of the municipality.
The carriage and free circulation of grain and
other provisions, continues to meet with greac
interruption from the fears and fufpicionsof the
people in the provinces ; particularly in the de
partments of the Loiret, Loir and Chur, Indre
and Loir, and Magenrie and Loire, which has
drawn upon the directories of those department*
a very sharp monitory from the minilter, by the
King's order.
M. de Damas, late governor of Martinique, is
accused before the national aflembly, by (oineof
the persons whom he sent to France, of sedition
and rebellion at the commencement of the trou
bles in that island. Are there no tribunals of
juftire but the legiflarive body, which cannot ex
ercise it without violating the constitution ? But
what is become of the amnesty !
VIENNA, October 14.
Government has just published an ordinance,
enjoining all its magistrates " ftriftly to observe
the conduct of the French emigrants in the pro
vinces of Austria : to prevent all unlawful exces
ses and dangerous enterprizes on their part, and
to be particularly careful that they do not enlist
any Austrian fubjetfsâand even to compel all
such Frenchmen to quit the country, who are un
der suspicions of that natureâtofeize upon their
persons, if necessary, to examine them, and to fee
that they he furnidied with no (applies whatever
by the fubjecfts of Austria, that might enable them
to acl offenfively against their country.

PEARL FISHERY
With the late advices received from the East-
Indies, a letter was received by a gentleman in
the city, giving an account of a late season of
Pearl-fifhing, full of information as to the nature
of it, and the success with which it was altered.
There fell some very fine rains at theo'*ej>ing
of the season. The several barks employed ia
the filhery put off each morning before the fuu
rose, and returned about noon.
The clivers were some of the mod expert in the
world. As soon as a bark had cad anchor, every
diver tied an heavy weight to one as his feet,
which funk him to the bottom of the sea. Here
he moved upon the sand, or among the points of
rocks, tearing off the oysters he met with, and
pulling them into a net tied to him by a long
cord, the other end of which was fattened to the
fide of the bark. By the fame cord he was pul
led when he was supposed to want air.
A fine /killFul boy, of spirit and adventure, ne
ver returned with his net; he was destroyed by
some fi(h. This sometimes happens, and is on<
of the greatest perils of pearl-fiftiing.
Â» â¢ â¢ - 1
The divers in general wore no sooner brought
up, than into the Tea they jumped again, conti
nuing this violent exercise without, intermission
for many hours. On the fliore they unloaded
their barks, and laid their oysters in pits dug in
the sand, till the fun opened and killed them
and oot dropped the pearls.
The pearls have an advantage over precious
(tones dug out of rocks, which owe their lustre
entirely to human industry ; â whereas the for
mer are einbellifhed purely by nature, and the
finiftiing of them is only by art: they are formed
wirh that brilliant waier which makes them so
highly prized : they have an elegant polifli in the
sea : nature adorns them herfelf, before they are
taken from her: they coine fair, perfetfl, and
beautiful from their mother.CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY, January 10, 1792-
Continuation of the Debate tn the Petition oj Catha
rine Greene, widow of the late Gen. Greene.
General sumpt-er raid, with refpetft to
the resolution as it now hands, he should
always feel himfelf obliged to oppose itâno
thing that has fallen from the gentleman over
the way (General Wayne) has convinced me that
the measure is proper or just. It was necelikry,
he said, to be cautious in the manner of difcufl
ing a matter of so much delicacyâhe did not
rife to make any pointed objections at present
that can in any degree injure the reputation of
the officer whose abilities he refpedted, or to hurt
the feelings of his family or connections. I lup
pofe, said he, that no gentleman will decide in
favor of the resolution without examining the
merits of the cafe : the committee will have that
information which they shall deem to be requi
site on the occasion. lam fÂ»rry to difFer in opi
nion with the gentleman from Georgia, and am
therefore difpol'ed to make lacrifices of my own
feelings of part injuries, and will not fufFer them
to warp or bias my judgment, but will endeavor
to decide in conformity with the opinions of the
people the state of South Carolina, and in parti
cular of the diftri<st which I have the honor to
represent. In going into the investigation of this
matter, I will give my reasons why 1 do not think
the country, although in extreme distress, was
in that deplorable situation which has been re
presented ; neither was its credit reduced folow
but that relief might have been obtained, and
that so small an army might have been accom
modated had a proper application been made in
time to the government. âThe gentleman mult
therefore be mistaken in Itating those circum
stances, for if the proper documents be examin
ed, it will appear that the army received very
ample supplies from the fame source, some months
previous to the contract made by Mr. Banksâ
which mult have been in November, or early in
December, and previous to the evacuation of
Charleston. Whether it was better to adopt the
means used by Gen. Greene, or those within the
power of the government, 1 shall iÂ»ot pretend to
determine, but I have no doubt but that the go
vernment poflefled both the means and the incli-
nation.
The contrail was firft made by Banks in No
vember or December, and Gen. Greene did not
become the guarantee until the April following
âwhether there were any reasons for preferring
this mode to that of an application to govern
ment, will perhaps appear in the course of the
investigation.
Mr. Chairman, this contract has been consider
ed to have operated rather as a misfortune, al
though it may have afforded a temporary relief:
it was the occasion of much complaint, vexation
and difltruft, rather than of conciliation : and
th&t difcouten-t ran through the army is with
in wie knowledge of several officers whose names
could be mentioned.
It is therefore neceflary to bring the matter
into the full view of the committee, and to have
recÂ«urfe to the files of the public offices, before
we agree to the resolution on the table. At the
fame time it is my sincere wiffi to render jullice
to the family of the deceased in every reasonable
accommodation ; but it does not appear to me
that the family are reduced to that disagreeable
situation which has been representedâThe large
grants that have been made by the dates of Geor
gia, North and South-Carolina, are (till in the
pofleflion ofthe heirs ofthe deceased, and 1 have
been informed that a gentleman offered 30,000
dollars for that granted by N. Carolina, so late as
last fumtnerâneither have I Iveard that any dis
tress has been levied upon any of these estates, or
that they are so much affedted in reality, but tha:
the claims made againll them are rather of a no
minal and visionary nature.âBut admiting that
General Greene was fertility for the United
States, and that the operation had been benefi
cial, (which by the bye I deny) does it appear
that executions have been levied to any consider
able amount, or to such an extent as to iuftify
the present application ?_To me it does not ap
pear this has been the cafe, neither do 1 believe
that the estate has been reduced in the manner
represented ; and whilst I fay it, I honestly and
unceieJy hope it ; under which impreflion I can
never accede to the resolution on the table
Mr. WadfworthâThe gentleman lalt up has
saul many things to me utterly unintelligible
and others which diredtly militate with what I
lias been said by the gentleman from Georgiaâ '
He has, however, declared that no real or sup
posed perfotia! injury (hall influence him in giv
ing his opinion or voteâl hope, fir, he will not
now feel or resent those real or supposed inju
ries Ido believe they are not realâand from
my long and intimate acquaintance with Gen.
Greene, 1 had good opportunity to know himâ
a better man I never did knowâthat he had e
nemies is not to be wondered atâthe nature of
his command to the southward was important,cri
tical and difficult, and he might be constrained
to do things that neceflity only would joftifyâ
if he has injured any man he has attoned for it
neither the tougue or pen of malice have been
able to affix a ltigma on his charadierâlf I ever
knew a man whose heart was pure and without
guile, it was Gen. Greeneâyet he had enemies
âno man deserved them so littleâmore honed
fame is due to no manâand if his fortune is to
be facrificed, and his family beggared, it is a con
folarion that his good name will lall forever.â
Being one of his executors, I know something of
his affairs, but it was with reludlance 1 rose, as
my attachments to him and concern for his fa
mily, render it extremely difficult for me to en
ter on the fubjediâThe gentleman from South-
Carolina has told us he is acquainted with the
affairs of the estates in the Carolinas, and has
told us they are without any executions against
them, the bonds on good credit, and the family
in no danger of poverty, &c.âl can hardly al
low, fir, that he is acquainted with the affairs of
Gen. Greene, even in South-Carolina and Geor
giaâbut if he is, I will ask him if he does not
know that all the negroes from the South-Caro
lina estate are fold, and the land totally unpro
ductiveâthat Mr. Rutledge has prevented exe
cutions from taking the Georgia estate by his
personal interferenceâthat all the estates in
Rhode-Island and New-Jersey are fold and
that the hope of the justice we now ask for, has
delayed the sale of all the reftâto fatisfy his
creditorsâhis southern creditors !
The proofs and documents alluded to by the
gentleman, (Gen. Sumpter) have been before
Congress for several years, and the friends and
executors of Gen. Greene, have challenged his
enemies in every part of the Union to disprove
themâand I hope no delay will now take place
âthe business is fully before Congressâl hope
justice will be done to the widow and orphans
of the late Gen. Greeneâand that the investiga
tion -will now be finifhedâhis honed fame vin
dicated and eftabliihedâand his family saved
from the ruin that awaits then).
MONDAY, January 24.
Same Subjefl continued.
Col. Hartley, in support of General Wayne's
motion, observed, I have paid some attention to
the report and the documents referred to in it,
as well as the objections made to the resolutions
under consideration.
Many of the objections have been answered by
gentlemen who were nearer the Scene of a&ion
than myfelf: I shall strive to obviate others.
The mode of conducting our affairs in South-
Carolina, does not seem to have been agreeable
to the gentleman opposite to me from that state
(Gen. Sunipter) and he expresses his high disap
probation of many parts of it. When 1 disagree
with that gentleman, I do it with great reluctance;
for no one en this floor has a greater refpecft for
him than myfelf.
In a hazardous and difficult situation, or in
carrying on war, or even in great politicaj ques
tions, the bell friends may differ in the mode of
conducing the fame ; and it has too frequently
happened, that such difference has tended to les
sen the friendfhip which formerly existed. Upon
the whole, our arms to the southward were
crowned with success: we must presume the
means generally used, were right.
If supplies could have been furnifhed by the
state of South-Carolina, it is a pity they were not
granted. I fay, it is poflible Gen. Greene might
have pursued a different mode to obtain cloathino
and prorrifion. He did not. He was of
no other plans could have been fuccefsfully fol
lowed, but those which were adopted.
The idea of his being a partner with Banks
and Co. seems to be given up bv the opposition.
The mere insinuation of Mr. Banks and some
others, can have no influeuce against such a cloud
of evidence and documents. These for the Ge
neral are so ttrong, that they would work con
viction upon almost the greatefl infidel.
I shall barely advert to a part of them, as men
tioned in the report, and on this head srive a few
observations of my,own.
The application to the legiflarnre of South-
Carolina, in order to create a competition. Had
he been concerned as a partner, or intended to
be io no competition through that channel would
have been proposed. If he was to be a partner,
ad'Zige " "â¢ lnr * 5U, â¢". "iEI." lhÂ«
Tile bond of indemnity so General Greene.
Oaths of Banks and Hunter,
326
Certificate from Major Forfytb.
Natbahiel Pendleton's oath.
Charles C. Pinckney's oath (now Governor of
Sonth-Carolina) and the certificates of the tw o
Chancellors of South-Carolina, who were both
high in the executive, when tliefe tranfaiftions
/hould have happened.
Besides, fir, if we consider how many partners
there were concerned with in the different
transactions ; had General Greene been one of
the Company, it must long since have been ma
nifefted to the world. The secret could not have
been kept nor can we possibly think, that Gen.
Greene (who was undoubtedly a man of nnder-
Itanding) would have exprefled himfelf in the
manner he has done, in the close of his letter
from Newport, dated the 24th of August, 1785
had he been a partner. He fays there, " Thus
have I given your Excellency a short narration of
the origin and situation of this matter, and have
only to add on this fubjedt, that I never held any
commercial connexion with the company, other
than what concerned the public, either diretflly
or indiredtly, or ever received onefarthingprofit
or, emolument, or the promise of any one from
them ; and my bond of indemnity expressly de
clares that I have 110 interest, connexion or con
cern in the debts for which I became bound, all
which I am willing to verify on oath."
Could he pledge his honor, his reputation, had
he been guilty of an untruth ? No, it is impotfi
ble ! nature cannot credit it. He would have
been silent had he been a culprit, and not have
challenged the world, as the power of detection
would have laid with so many, and the (haft of
envy always readyâl hope every man tnuft be
fatisfied that the General was no partner.
The great points of contest before the commit
tee seem now to be, v
I ft. Did the Genera! enter into these engage
ments out of personal regard to individuals, with
out a view to the public interest?
2dly. Was not the good of the public his prin
cipal object ?
Under all circumstances, (hould riot his
eftatebe indemnified ?
As to the firtt, I cannot think that the General,
out of mere personal regard to individuals, with
out a view to the public good, would have been
bail. He had been elteemed a man of prudence,
and was not a person of large fortune. How
would he embarrass his family and property in
such engagements? Who, under mere motives
of friendship, would have done so ? The sum was
too largeâhe had no interest. He got no goods
or money for himfelf. He might have had a fa
vorable opinion of some of the company, bat his
relponfibility was become neceflary with a view
to the public good.
As to the second, public good inuft have been
his principal object. The contracts before made
would not have been carried into execution,
without the aid of the contract, for which the in
demnity was made in April 1783. A great manv
articles were absolutely neceflary to the armyâ
they were connected with othersâthe neceflaries
could not at that critical period, or for the mo
ment, be obtained else where. The merchants,as
I understand, infilled upon two conditions before
they would deliver the goodsâift, that all (he
goods should go togetherâ2d, that the command
ing officer should become security.
There was a necessity for an additional capital,
Co furnifh the means for supporting the army;
and as mod of the goods were ufeful and neces
sary, the residue might be disposed of to the bed
advantage, and the money arising from them be
applied towards payment of the debt*-
Public necessity and the (late of things would
oblige the General to agree to the firft condition.
The compliance with the second condition be
came a neceflary consequence.
The General's letter from Newport, and Gen.
Wayne's oath, Nathaniel Pendleton's oath, and
other evidence, prove the situation of the army.
As to the third point, should nor his eflate be
indemnified ?âThrough his zeal for the public
good, he has unfortunately involved hiseftatem
difficulty, whatever the conduct of the company
might be. The creditors were not to be ?ffected
either by the fraud or failure of Banks and the
purchasers. General Greene was liable.
The General, when he hears of mifcÂ«ndoct,
does all he can Co save and indemnify himfel'*
and through him the United States fecuriti'j
were taken in as ample a manner as they com
be obtained from the delinquents ; and Genera
Greene never wished to call upon the public,
until every other means failed. So late as t
year 1785 he had dill hopes there would be no
loss, but then he found the danger ; a fenff 0
duty obliged him to come forward to save hiw
felf and family, to ask the protection of thep"
lie, to indemnify him from a debt that he '
contracted to save an army from mutiny and >
banding ; to protect a country which other"" e
would have been exposed. Many exertions ij>
he to make to feed the hungry and co*c 1 Â®
naked : were not these for the public good, a"
(hall his private property fuffer ? Shall his
ly be reduced to beggary, be ltiipped of t 61all to discharge what the United States are in
honor and jnftice bound to pay ?
Retrospective lÂ«tws, to afFeift rights attacked,
ou"ht never to pais ; but laws have frequently
been enacted to indemnify persons tor a con
du<ft, though not ftridlly legal, but founded on
the special circumstances of the cafe : the l.itety
or honor of a nation or army, where the contli â¢
tutional authority could not come forward in
time. Such was the treaty or system formed by
the Duke of Marlborough and the great DeWitt.
The j)utch instead of punishing their minilteiy
approved the inealure ; it eventually tended to
the fafety and honor ol the allies.â Ihe indivi
dual risks the step fW his country's good âa mag
nanimous government will always fanclify.
We fliould consider the cafe upon fubltamial
principles, not according to the letter, not a<ft as
the Lacedemonians did to one o( their leaders ;
they fined him for the infringement of the let
ter of the law, yer for the fame act rewarded the
hero with a garland.
The fine here ruins the General's eltate, and
the garland alone, ! fear, in this country, will
not give his children bread or a becoming edu-
cation. . ,
In our late contest the common maxims of old
nations could not always be adhered to. We
were obliged to ndl according to emergencies
In the cafe Greene, he seems to have in

save a country. His merit Itands high indeed.
I need not repeat the nmnber of his great and
glorious actions, which mark him the General
and the hero. His name will be handed down
with honor to succeeding ages.
Under all circuniftances 1 think his estate
should be indemnified. If the committee do not
like the whole of the resolution, let there be a
division, as proposed by one of the gentlemen
from South-Carolina ; though I fhoiild think we
might iafely vote for the whole of the rel'oltti
ob, and let the bill make airp other provisions
â which may be thought neceflary.

dry remarks on extratfs from letters wrote by
General Greene during the late war, inferred in
Gordon's History of the American Revolution,

the militia of South-Carolina, & the patriotism of
the inhabitants of that state. These reflections;

General Wayne's resolutions, as before stated,
were negatived, and a proportion laid on the ta

EXTRACTS FROM AN EUROPEAN PUBLICATION.
NO time ought to be loft in North America to introduce a ge
ral attention to the right inftruftion of youth. Combinations
ought to be formed in every county, province and city lor that
purpose, and small academies, instead of large colleges ought to
be promoted, particularly under the clergymen ; by which means
a brood of learned clergymen will be established on thecontinent,
and every parish will have the feeds of learning carefully sown,
which will produce a virtuous and proiperous people hereafter.
The education of the-female sex ought to be particularly at
tended to, and the fatal error avoided, that a woman's chief excel
lence consists in being able to make a pudding.
On the virtue, diligence, and fufficient learning and sentiment
of women, depend thecolourand texture of the character of their
sons.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FENNO,
I OBSERVE that in your last Gazette, it is said, that " Lord
Dorchester" was given as a toast bv three of the companies
which met in Quebec to celebrate the Constitution ; it may have
escaped your recolle&ion that Lord Dorchester is Governor General
of Britjh Americaâand as such is in the Hi ft lift of toasts publilhed
in a formei paperâconsequently was not omitted by either of
the companies aflembled on that occasion.
Philadelphia, February 8.
Extrafls from a letter jujl received J rom Cape-Francois, December 16.
" Wc expect 20,000 troops horn France, and true it is they
are much wanted ; the revolted negroes are still in arms, within
a few miles of us, and people of color are murdering the whites all
over the colon} : They have takejn sundry principal places, and
unless troops arrive loon, this country will be ruined ; 253 sugar,
and 1600 coffee works have already been burned, and a number
ot villages.
" A small veflel from Jamaica brings acconnts that the martial
law had been declared there to keep the negroes quiet."
" Since writing the above, the revolted {laves have, by two de
puties, demanded freedom tor their chiefs, and thev will make
peace; this was retufed. A vcflcl of war arrived yesterday with
130 soldiers, and accounts of 4000 being ready to embark.
" A small schooner trom Jamaica brings an account of the
whites having armed the negioes against the mulattoes, and thap
they had killed many of them."
The Brig Hannah, Capt. Latimer, of Philadelphia, arrived at
New-York on the evening of 2d Feb. Accounts from Cape-
Francois fay, the negroes continue burning and destroying the
country. The day before the Hannah failed, viz. Jan. Ift, the
Negroes made a deiperate atiack on Fort Dauphin, the event of
which was not known ; the produce of the Island of every kind
was very scarce, and niiog daily in value. Four hundred troops
had arrived 111 a frigate from France and brought the account of
3,000 more troops icaov for failing in two or three days after,
this frigate was immediately difparched to Port-au-Prince, from
whence the news arrived, that the remains of that town was de
populated. On the 15th Dec. an engagment began at Port-au
"Prince between the Mulattoes and Whites, the event unkown, the
lhipping of the harbor were under an embargo. St. Marks was in
pofTeflion of the Mulattoes who had armed a (hip and several small
vefl'cls which were cruifing'to intercept vefiels going in to Port-au-
Prince, rtiey had taken a French fch. loaded with provisions arid
carried her into St. Marks ; the Capt. in attempting to escape was
shot, a frigate was sent to cruifeoff St. Marks in search of the a
bove mentioned veflels.
The profpeft which the Managers of the Hospital have in view
of extending the building lo provide for a greater number of pa
tients, must be highly acceptable to a charitable and humane peo
ple.
When it is considered, that the inhabitants of the State are more
than double the number they were when the present house was
erected, the piopricty of enlarging it in proportion to the iticreafe
is evidently felt.
On enquiry it will be found, that, at this time, there are in the
Hospital not less than forty lunatic patients, and the apartments
provided for the accommodation of maniacs, will not admit of
more than twenty.

t'onÂ»d as any reflection on the gentlemen who iupo intend the in
(titution ; for it is well known, (hey contribute their money, arid
much of their time, to relieve the unhappy objefls of their cjrc
but how ran they effectually do it, unlets apartment* art provided
adequate to the numbers they receive.
it would excite pity in the bread of any fpe#ator, to observe a
c*fe which happened the other day (and cases of that kind are not
uncommon) âA youug lad whose feet were frozen, was in luch a
condition, that the physicians, on confuting, thought it was nted
lul to take off his legs in order to f#ve his life.
The poor boy lay in the long ward near three maniacs confined
in chains, which rattled in h.s hearing, while the cries of murder,
fire, and every alarmingnotfe, was diihirbing his repose day and
night. To relieve a person in this situation, seems to be almolt
impossible ; yet I am told he is likely ro lecover, under the grea*
care of the hospital physicians. A due separation of such patients
is theohjeft in extending the building, and, it is hoped, that all
the charitable citizens ol Pennsylvania will embrace the views of
their benevolent predecefTors, who founded the institution on a
liberal scale, to relieve the miserable lunatic and Tick poor, with
out partiality or preference to any.
Bv uniting together in their public and private stations. to es

wig, which hath already been founded, and hitherto condudted,

If it (hould be admitted that our frontier people have been the
aggressors, it only shews that the duty of a just government would
be to offer leparation for the wrong, and to seek peace. Buc
when every offer of peace is reje&ed, as it has been by the Indians,
they become the aggrefTors. [utlice is on the fide of the United
States.
But in time of war, the law of force subsists. lam nor to stand
"'ll and let another put me to death, because I have given him
reason to be angry. In this state did the government find matters.
Mutual injuries and provocations had kindled a predatory war on
the frontiers. The President fought peace, and lought it in vain.
No government, unless administered by Quakers, would lit it ill
and fee its citizens butchered. Congress did what seemed tM> be
right at the time. They had not a war to make, but they haa one
to carry on. They proposed to make it a short It seemed
to be the cheapest way to raise a fttong force and take a strong
post, which probably would bring the Indians to accept peace;
that being all rhai was defied. Had Congress negle&cd the de
fence of the frontiers, would they have avoided complaint? Had
they trufled to sudden inroads of an iiregular force, would not
the complainers have said tfiat 'hey were afraid of putting an end
to the war ? The'man in the fable, who was not allowed to drive
his ass, nor to ride him. nor to fuffer his son to ride him, has dif
fered perplexity for our benefitand inftruftion.âThere is no inea
fuie which will suit every bodyâGovernment must do it's duty,
and protest the defencelcfs. according to the social compact, and
trust to the good fenle of the citizens for it's juftification.
Government is a trust in the hands of the rulersâDoubtless this
is true ; but it is equally true that a free government is a trust, and
a precious one, in the hands of the people. Each individual con
fides in the reason and good disposition us every other individual,
not only that he wilj obey the laws, but that he will atford ins
voice, and, if necefTary, his strength, to preserve or restore good
order. Without this support of the lovers of order, the govern
ment of this country would not have so much as the (hadow of
force. Its life is in every man's hand, and every good man will
consider this trust as a sacred one. It is such a man's duty, as
well as his interest, to watch for the government which he has as
sisted to establishâhis duty, because he has engaged to do itâand
his interest, beraufe a free government is a rare privilege and blet
fing, and, if loft, not rafilv to be recovered. It is besides the only
mound between him and anarchyâa state in which every man
becomes the tyrant of the weak, and the Have ot the strong.
In this free country, therefoie, the people havecaufe to be jealous
of the attempts madeagainft government. It is being jealous for
themselves. It is to be lamented, that so many writers think it
their duty to hold np the government of the United States, and the
men who are entrusted with the administration of it, in such fright
ful colors. Thedefire to gain the praHe'of doing well, is as natu
ral to men in office as to men in a less conspicuous condition oÂ£
life.
