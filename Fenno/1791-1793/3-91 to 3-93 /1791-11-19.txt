Mr. Fitzfimons called up the petition of a torn
mittee of the public creditors, who loaned mo
ney to the Unircd States, between September
1 777, and March 1778, and moved rhat itibould
be referred to the Secretary of the Treafui-y,fur
his opinion on the prayer of the petition.
Mr. Sedgwick observed that the fubjetf of this
perition had undergone a decision during the
last session, wher) a petition of a similar nature
was presented. Speculation, he said, had alrea
dy taken a fufliciently ample range through the
United States ; and he hoped no new parhÂ»
would be opened forits future walks. He would
move thar the prayer of the peiition could not
be granted.
1., s
Mr. Fitzfimons said, that the natare of the
petition seemed to be misunderstood ; he was as
little disposed as any gentleman on the floor, tÂ»
innovate in the funding system ; he would not
undertake to. pronounce, that the petitioners
were entitled to any relief, bnt he thought the
Secretary of the Treasury did nor coufider thii
cafe as provided for under the funding law, in
which cafe, he thought thar the wisdom and jus
tice of the house were interested in takiiig'the
fame into confederation.
Mr. Gerry, after giving the history of rlie
emission of the bills of credit in qnefVion, urged
the propriety of doing equal jultice to every
class of the public creditors, and declared in fa
vor of the reference to the Secretary of the Trea
sury, who would state fatfs, upon which the
lioufe could determine whether or no the prayer
of the petition could be granted.
Mr. Sedgwick thought a fuflicient provision
had been made ; that it was not the intereit ot"
the people to proceed any farther ; this would
only raise paflions, that were now fobfided, hut
had heretofore been productive of considerable
mifchief to the country ; it would (hew the peo
ple, that the house entertained doubts refpecft
ing the futficiency of the provision ; fpeculatois
would employ all their arts to draw the certifi
cates out of the hands of the present holders ;
and he left it to gentlemen to determine whe
ther such a scene of fpecalatiou would prove ad
vantageous to the country ; besides, he would
ask, whether the required provision could he
made without altering the fyllem already esta
blished ?
States,
Mr. Gerry observed, that the objection, drawn-,
from Speculation, would prove an argument e
qually valid against funding, and even againlt
the coinage of money, since gamblers would ap
ply the coin to the purposes of gaining ; it had
been said, that many of the certificates in ques
tion had been loaned : but be would a(k, whe
ther, because a number of persons, not kuowing
their rights, lud yielded thein up, an argumenc
could thence be drawn, why others, who under
(tood their rights should not maintain thein, or
why the former (hould not be redressed ? Ought
the government to take advantage of the ignor
ance of the public creditois ? he hoped not : the
former memorial, to which the gentleman [Mr.
Sedgwick] alluded, was very different from the
present one, and contained many matters, which
would have required a total alteration of the
funding system.
Mr. Lawrance saw 110 necefiity for a
rence : a knowledge of faifts could be obtained
front the journals of Congress ; as to applying*Â®
the Secretary for his opinion, this would only
prove a source of embarraflment ; better to take
it up in committee of the whole, or in the house,
without a knowledge of his opinion : when the
scale of depreciation was applied to the public
debt, it was unequally applied, some receiving
interest 011 the nominal, others on the specie va
lue ; in the funding bill it was
that thfe former class fliould be allowed fucii W*
CONGRESS.
*tereft irp to the dose of the 3afl ypar ; ant! the
only question now is, whether any alteration
ihall be made in the funding bill ; whether one
class of public< creditors /hail have a different
measure of jultice dealt out to them, from what
others have had : he concluded with a wish that
the fubjetft fiiould be taken up in committee of
the whole.
The quedion, on the reference to the .Secre
tary of iiiÂ« 1 reafury, was then taken, and loft
v. liere upon,
JY!r. Luwranrc mover!, that the perition fhou!d
be referred to a committee of the whoie house.
Mi". jÃondiuot was ofoplnion, th:-t tliefunding
fyllem ' la d done ample juflice, and that thok
v, ho complied with it, have no reasonable ground
tit' complaint : at the time of thepafiing the law,
it had been laid, that men would be forced by
it to come in and subscribe, whether they would
or not ; a clause was there/ore inserted in favor
of non-fiibfcribing public creditors, by virtue'of
wbirh.the petitioners,who areof the non-fubfciilv
itig dais, consider themselves in the fane Jituati
oii us befoie the law was enabled ; but an impio
per conltrutflion has been given to that clause,
and therefore it is that the creditors complain :
were any one of them to bring an adlion against
the public officers, he would in his opinion, ob
tain redress : they applied to the House for re
drew ; and thequeftion was, wiiether they should
be forced to subscribe, or be entitled to the bene
fit of their contract ; he would not wijh that any
man should be forced to comply with the terms
of the funding system ngainft his will : he would
have every man at liberty to accept or reject them
at his pleasure.; and he thought it unreasonable
that any man should have his fix per cent reduc
ed to four, without his own consent.
Mr. JFitzfimons thought further information
on the fuhjeift neceflary, and therefore it was,
that he favored the reference : one circu'tnftance,
he said, was unattended to by the gentlemen who
had spoke on the Aibje<ft ; and that was, that the
non-fuhfcribing creditors mult deliver up the o
riginal certificates, before they can receive their
interett ; but this they do not choose to do, be
caul'e these certificates bear a promise of interest
on the original value,and they would afterwards
receive interest only on the reduced value.
The quellion being then taken on the commit
ment to a committee of the whole, and loth
Mr. Sedgwick moved a resolution, that the
prayer of the petition cannot be granted.
The queflion being called for, Mr. iiarnewell
oblerved that he, and probably fonie others of
the new members, were not thoroughly acquaint
ed with the fubjeOt ; and therefore hevyifliedthe
quellion might be puftponed. The resolution
Was, in conference, ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. Lawrance then called up a petition of
fonHry inhaditants of tlie state of New-York,
holders of certain bills of credit, ilS'ued in 1780.
Referred to the Secretary of the Treafory, to
consider and report his opinion thereon.
Mr. Baldwin called up the petition of General
Jackson, relative to the Georgia election ; which,
after, some debate, was referred to the commit
tee heretofore appointed to report a regular and
uniform mode of proceeding in cases of ronteited
elections. Adjourned.
THURSDAY, November 17,
Mr. Hartley, member for Pennsylvania, and
Mr. Schoonmaker, from New-York, took their
feats this day.
Sundry petititions were presented, read, and,
committed.
Mr. Lawrance laid the following refolntionon
the table,
Ilefolved, That a committee be appointed to
bring in a bill for extending tlje time limited for
fettling the accounts between the United States
Â»tid individual States.
IN COMMITTER OF THE WHOLE,
On the bill directing rbe mode in which, certain
evidences of the debt of the United States which
have been loft or destroyed, may be renewedâ
Mr. Muhlenberg in the chairâ
The bill was read.
Mr. Sedgwick moved that tlie words, loft or,
fcould be ltruck out of the firlt clauseâHe said
that the provisions in the bill to guard against im
position on the public in cases of 101 l certificates,
did not appear to him to be adequate to the pur-
P"'Â® â an 'l this was not only his opinion, but that
of every gentleman who was on the committee
**ho hail reported the bill in the above foiin, a
greeable to orders of the Hoivfe, He called on
ihofe gentlemen who were in favor of retaining
the Words, to devise a mode by which the public
Blight be secured.
Mr. Lawrance was opposed to the motionâHe
thought the bill itfelf contained competent pro
viuons in the cafe ; he pointed out several other
Particulars which might be attended to in the
P r Â»cefs of this bnfinefs, that would afford fuffici
ei 't securityâ furh as the checks which would
-l-eitain that the certificates, which it was ("aid
loft, had exiftedâreference to the left cer
li -c.aie might be contained in the certi
".nteâa procra.:>nat!pÂ» for a considerable time
"i the payment of the mtereit, & r
Mr Sedgwidc . c-piied, that the difficulties would

.leÂ»a, had higgelted. The committee
Pl'-l for information to the Officers of the
â  ! eall!! T." ho werit decidedly of opinion that no
. cfeqit.ite provifton againlb deception could bede
' ed in respect to the renewal of lolt certificates.
Conhct-rahie debate occurred on the motion,
bi. h was finally agreed 10, and the words 101 l or
ltrr.cK out. Sundry other amend merits were agreed
to by the committeeâthey then rose, and the
Chairman raported them to the house.
On motion to agree to the fir ft amendment,
Mr. Bourne (R. I.) said he hoped that it would
not be agreed to, as he conceived the bill in its
pi e.ent form would not afford the relief proposed
in any degreeâbecause, he obl'erved, that there
were very few cases in which politive evidence
of i,ic delh uction of a certificate could be pro-
Mr. Sedgwick observed that, most undoubtedly,
Itrong prejianpthe evidence would answer in eve
ry cafe, which would come before the perlbn ap
pointed to judge on t bote occasions.
Mr. Seney was opposed to the amendment he
laid it made a difcriminatioli between twoclafl'es
of unfortunate per.sons, which was not warrant
ed in reason or justice. If this amen J-nent Jhould
be agreed to, he should think himfelt obliged to
vote sgainft the bill altogether.
Mr. Sheredine and Mr. Murray spake a)fo a
gainfl the motion to agree to the ameadhient
An adjournment being tailed for, the house rose
without taking the vote.

ley ot the cl<Hs whose feats will become vacant at the expira
tion of four years, trom March, 1791â and Mr. Robinson, of
l/fat whole feats will be vacated in fix years,
A bill refpe&ing Consuls and Vice-Consuls, and a biU to deter

United States, have had a second reading :n the Senate of thcfUniic*!
States.
In our lad it was mentioned that the King of Spain had declar
ed war against rhc Moor*âit now appears that the sovereign of
Morocco had been before hand in declaring war against .Span;.
The letter from the King of France to the Natipnal AHembly,
Â«n which he accepts of the Couftmnion, is dated the 13th <S C p:!
On the 14th he was to meet ihe National AlTemblv to ratify th<-
eeiebrated instrument in their presence. The Ceremony of the
proclamation of the Constitution took pJace the 18th, in the FieJd
of Confederation. The Mayor of Poms, preceded by Heralds',
and surrounded by a numerous and brilliant troop of grenadiers'
ascended the Altar of the Country \ arrived at the summit, he held
up the Constitutional Code to the veneration of an immense mul
titude of citizens, who rent the air with shouts and acclamations
of joy. At 5 o'clock, a superb balloon -/as raised, and in the
evening the molt brilliant illuminations took place in the Â£lyfi3n
Fields, &c. &c. Ihe King and Queen, with the Prince Royal, vi
sing these, were received with enthusiasm, and shouts of Vive U
Roi, and Vive la Reine, were heard from all quarters. The Aristo
crats, it is said, are all in the utmost consternation at the Kino's ac
cepting the Constitution.
Thus the National AfTembly have brought their labors to a tri
umphant ifTue, by giving to the people of France a Conllitution,
in which, like that of the United States,the principle of improve
ment is infufed ; so that, if on experiment, it (hould be lound in
adequate to the preservation of Â«' peace, liberty and fafctt," it is
fufcepuble of being carried to the delired degree of perfection.
The fubjetH of the disturbances in the French
Colonies has occasioned much warmth in the Na
tional Aflembly, according to the latest accounts.
1 he intelligence we may expert to receive from
France after the recent accounts from Hifpaniola
lhail have reached Europe, will bo peculiarly in
teresting; for notwithstanding the idea of' dif
tanc Colonies as appendages to a government
has been lately philosophized upon, as disadvan
tageous, and pernicious to the parent country,
it appears that very powerful intei efts :\re in
volved in the question as it refpecfts France.
As a free government depends on the virtue of
the people, and every degree of virtue owes its
exigence to light and informationâthe friends
of our happy Constitution and the rights of the
people, may be felic'.ated on the profpec't which
now prcfents of (opening the channels of infor
mation to all parts of the Union. The Prefidenc
of the United States, with that promptitude ai;Â«l
decision with which he delivers his opinion on
erery fubjetft connected with the public welfare,
has recommended this business to t he serious con
lideration of the Legifiature.âAnd it maybe de
pended on that every individual member of both
houses, a* well as every officer at the head of the
executive departments, are fully imprefled with
this ideaâthat the people have a right to be fully
informed of the tranfadtions of their government,
and of the reasons on which all its decisions are
founded. This being the cafe, it is hardly pos
sible that the public expeiftation fliould be again
disappointed.
Extrafi of a letter from Port-au-Prince, dated Oil, 25
" I have the pleasure of informing you, that
peace is once more made between the Whites ancl
Mulattoes, on Saturday last, the 22d inlL andyef
terday 2500 of the latter marched with their arms
into town, and paraded in company with the for
mer before the church ; at which time the inha
bitants, with the officers of each party, entered
the church, and lung Te Deum. How long the
peace will last, is uncertain, as a number of the
inhabitants are not well pleased. Upon what
terms the peace is made, I cannot at present in
form you."
The English newspapers are, according to some
late accounts, divided into three descriptions
Ministerial, Anti-Ministerial, and Neutralâthat
is, thofein favor of Administration, thofeagainft
it, and those who are indifferent. In this account
we do not find that there are any who are in fa
vor of the peopleâWhat a set of venal wretchec
does this make of the Printers !âThe fame, or
similar accounts, appear refpe<fting the French
papersâthej are said to be licentious to the
highest degreeâthe fa<fts only, which they de
tail, are to be relied onâfor in the collisions of
party, right and wrong, truth and falfliood are
merely convertible termsâHence weare obliged
to go to the Netherlands for impartiality and ho--
neflyâhence also the celebrity of the Leyden
Gazette, which is now said to be the oracle ot
politics in the European world.

Last Friday the Gcnei al Afl'embly of this (late
closed the Ortober session.
In the course of the session, many important
matters came before the afl'embly, which were
referred for further confederation to the aflenibly
to be holden in May next. Among others, were
the report of a committee on the petiiion of the
fufrerers in the feaport-tnwns, by the inroads and
depredations of the British daring the late war ;
stating their fiJStrings by loss of property to a.
mount of nearly three hundred thousand pounds;
and an offer of three hundred and fifry thousand
dollars for n quit-claim of the territory claimed
by this fVate, south of Lake Erie ; an atft regu
lating the militia of this state; with others of
less consequence. The bill for dividing tlifc state
in (even diftridis, each to choose one member of
Congress, was taken back after conliderable dis
cussion.
LONDON,
Extrxft of a letter from Warfavi, dated Augi/ft 17.
Transactions, exhibiting an inHance of niolt
abominable fanaticifm, which happened lately
in the city of Ilawa, about 12 leagues from this
place.
A reputable woman, widow of an apothecary,
named Wilke, a protestant, and an old inhabi
tant of that place, having Tome business to tranf
a<fl at Warsaw, was prelented by a friend with a
doll for the amusement of her children ; the old
est of which was a girl of 8 years old.
The children on receiving this doli, without
any offenfive intention, decorated the fame by
hanging a small effigy of the (so called) Mother
Mary around its neck, which had been given
them by a Monk.
A fanatic and enemy to the family, who was a
ftvbaltern in the grenadier regiment of Kalzinf
ki, gave information of this innocent diversion
and complaining thereof to the board of civil
and military commiflioners, as being facreligious,
who caused a criminal process to be ifliied against
the poor widow, mother of the children, by
which 4he was condemned, and sentenced to be
beheaded.
Providentially Mr. Krapinfki, a member ofthe
Consistory of Diflenters at Warsaw, hearing of
this unnatural proceeding, iiiimediately present
ed a petition ia favor of this unhappy woman,
to the King and Sovereigti Council ; in confe
queneeof which, a Salvus was granted
to the poor widow, and orders given to the judge
to Hay the execution : Privilege was also granted
her to appeal-to- the-mixed Aifefibrial Court, to
determine refpetfing her unhappy situation.
This court, although it preserved the life
of the woii'an, nevertheless, pronounced the
following inhuman sentence, viz. â¢' That the
unhappy mother (hould be compelled to chastise
her own children in the presence ofthe initia;a
rorwith a rod, so long, and until the blood Ihould
follow the rod !"âOf which piiniihment one of
the children now lies dangeroiifiy ill. After the
above sentence was executed, the doll was pub
lickly burned on the 9 fh day of AuguO:, by the
hand of the common executioner.
