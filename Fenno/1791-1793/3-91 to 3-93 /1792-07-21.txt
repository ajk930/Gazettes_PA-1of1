PROCLAMATION,
(concluded-)
THESE meafnres, which France seems now to
have forgotten, were quoted to the prince? ot
the empire as an example proper tor them to imi
tate 111 the refpe&> ve ffates, anr3 with which the
defpoiic agents of the French government wouiti
be fatisfied.
We (hall avoi<l taking notice of all the calami
ties with which France is aHli&ed, we should leave
to time the disclosure of the machinations perpe
tually recommended by a set of insidious writers
jn their dangerous publications, were it not evi
dent that, at the moment of the intended aggres
sion againlt these provinces, a resolution is taken
to ipread tfce poifcu of a ftduftive illusion on the
pretended advantages of the French conflitution,
with a view to make those pat takprs ot u who
may be deluded Uy this means ; but it is neceii'ary
that the people who aie confided to our govern*
mem be reminded and informed that the king
dom'of France groans at this time, in the name of
liberty, the moil hateful ftavery, every fpe
cics of vice, of the molt unhridl&l paflions, and of
a species of Â»nsÂ»(Â£by whico ts without example;
that rights and property ate abolilhed ; that the
holy religion which we profefs is there trodden
under toot ; that altars arc profaned and polluted ;
that their trur ministers are deprived ot their juil
rights, ill treated, peifecuted cv n in their retreats
ainoi.g foreign nations, and replaced by intruders
who have no million from the hieraichy of the
Church ; that the pallors of the people have even
been deprived ot the diltincbve vestments by
which they were known to their flocks ; that in a
jmonftrous code, rights have been extolled which
man cannot enjoy in foocty, and which he
tacitly renounces, by being boin in civilized af
fociattoii* ; that, purfuaut to those chimerical
rights, attempts have been made to abolifn, ov. r
turn, and confound those real rights which have
been tranfmnted under the protection ot the fun
damental laws of the kingdom, from generation
to generation, to those venerable dalles 10 which
the French nation had in every refpett, the highefl
obligations ; that real property has given way to
the name by seizing the eilates of those who had
Wen folcmnly inverted with them by time, by
the laws, and by an uninterrupted poflVflion a
hundred times renewed and confirmed by the
trud representatives of the nation ; and all thii
under the deceitful colour ot an equality of chi
merical rights, not exiftingin faff, and annihilated,
if it could for a moment ertift, by that variety o! '
character, ttnpreffed on all mankind at their birth,
by they share, in very unequal proportions,
inoial faculties, the very diiproportion or which
has always determined and will ever determine
the afcendeney of genius, itrenglh, pattcnce, in
dullry, and economy over the oppolite qualities,
together with all the advantages which may law
fully arise hom them, and which may be trauf
" letted like every other species of property.
Finally, it is necvflary that the faithful fubje&s
.ol 1115 inajefty be intoimcd tha - , while pains are
.taktp 10 <. xiol the pie tended glory and profpeiity
oi the kingdom of Fiance, lately the moil flouriih
iiig in Europe, there is now no commerce, nocu
* culation of I'prcic or goods, no public force, no
jullice, uo police, and that the pnilofophical per
secutors of all those who are not of their i.ft,
kpow no bounds to their exedjes, which they ex
cite their people to commit, except a taticty ol
crimrÂ«,
Who, a s t rth-Sy could be so blind 01 stupid a
,to p.ace the leatt confidi nee in the promises and
in the iufidious afl'urances made by thole tyrants
, to thofc nations whom they wtlh to subdue, thai
they will refpett their property, their religion,
their rights, their privileges, and their conftitunon ?
Tyrants, who, fwee they have usurped the public
power and force in France, have trodden under
foot, with an affrontery and audacity hcuhertq un
heard 01, the mo ft solemn public treaties, all rights
human and divine, and every thing which is held
! m.qft sacred all over the world ; who, the moment
they, thould bee me the mailers ol one province,
would Icize, a* they Have done in their own
tiy, the estates ol the clci'gy and nobility, and the
property ot the cili7.cn-.
Once mote, having never haa any inclination
to meddle with the internal government of ail)
neighboring Rate, we fnould not have entered on
these ?ffl 6ting details, relative to objects which
are foreign to the government with which weaie
rntiuftrd, were it not that French writings and
French enjiflaries, and even the recent adts ot the
11 w legÂ»flature of France have a tendency to ren
der a fylb-m ol innovations whether
good or bad for the French nation, certainly and
decidedly ruinous to the people under our govern
ment ; bccauf" it is lubvofivf of all that political
organization delineated by a conftiiution which
tTicv love, whtch the lovereign has engaged to
maintain, and on which lhe o? Belgium
has tor ag. been founded.
It was our du.y to warn the people of the im
minent dangeis with which they are threatened.
We have laid belere them tinths which all well
meaning pcrfons will acknowledge to be ftnking;
Â«n<t ibÂ©v "will, of courle, use their uttTioft endea

THE houfeof the Jacobins is to be
fold, therefore they must seek
out for another spot ou which to hold
tbeir fittingsâwith a changeof place,
it is hoped they will change their mca
fnrcsâThe universal cry is, the Ja
cobins have ruined France â
havs latlely moved that the protec
tioi: of the State (ball be put into the
hands of what they call a national le
gion, to be conipoled of Invalids !
Thry have again revived the absurd
idea of transferring the French crowil
to the Honl'e of Brttufviick âa fliort
time will determine at what value this
precious diadem is to be elHmated.
A bill has been ltnck up in all parts
of the town, intituled, a petition of
ten millions of the French nation !
it is however only signed by fix Jaco
bins ; it recommends depriving M.
De La Fa v htt e of all military com
mand ; it fays, his victories would be
more ruinous than onr late dil'graces {
so that it appears every thing is to be
wrought for Francs and Liberty by
magick, or rather the c;u:fe is to work
itfelf.
Rochambeau is said to be 110 less than
a.traitor ; that he is in an infamons
league to enslave both France and
glanders -, âthe proceedings at Lijle'-
are spoken of, as, in some cases which
could be named, worthy of imitation!
The subsequent observations have a re
trofpeil to the Man'tfeflaiS ijfucj by
the House of Auftr'ta aiid their General
in the Brabant 'tne provinces, to jnJUfy
the combination of that ."id certain o
ther continental powers againfi the re
jormedgovern;aent and anjhtiition oj
France.
Nothing can afford a clearer proof
that governmental reformation is far
behind national reformation, than the
principles which the Governors gene
ral in the L'ow Countries have dared
to publish Kdilfeminate in their pro
clamations. XVe there find aliertions
[the nioft falfe, imputations the moil
fianderous, and the denial of fatSs the
molt notorious, 'l'liey deny, for in-
Ihncc, that the emigrants have either
he'en protected or tolerated in Ger
many ;and that the French travellers
and residents in those dominions have
been infolted, abused and plundered.
This audacious impudence that can
cooly deny fa<fts known to all Europe,
is not new in their fyllem of politics.
What is molt aftonilhing is, the deli
berate coolness vvitli which defpotifin
pnblilhes the catechifin of its faith,
and repeais the ancient creed, at the
present period as it would have done
3o years ago. The sacred name of
God is iauroduced to fandtion their
worse than Gothic abuses of true go
vernment, the perpetuity, we may
fay, the eternity of the molt absurd
institutions, couched under the res
pedable appellation of fundamental
laws, but in l'a<ft annihilating the
rights of men, who have taciiiy re
nounced those rights, merely for the
benelit of aflbciamig together, and
living under a defpotifin, that has
made them its abfoiuie polieiiion and
[Whole No. 357.]
properly. Ami these aie the base
principles which ait- preached up to
Jr'.urope at nearly the dale of tlie
eighteenth ceimiiy.

The letters by the Flanders mail
delivered yedetday confirm in evfry
refpeit the 1 total defeat of the Freucti
in the two actions before Touruqy and
Mons. In the annals of the French
hiitory, we believe their troops never
met with similar disgrace, which is.
heightened by the cruelty of their
conduct towards their officers. Tha
Romans made it a practice to admin
iiter every soothing comfort to their
Commanders under misfortune, â;he-
refined manners of the new order of
men in France make the Turks their
example. [Eng/ijh Triumph.]
At the af&ir of" Alois, aco French
emigrants were present, but without:
arms and without commissions ; and
their conduct was so tiilpleaiing, that
they were ordered to cjnit ftions in
24 hours. Those (liil remaining irt
the Low Countries are seen every day
passing through Br:i(fc.'<, pu thpir way
to join the Princes, for fear of being
ttruck out of the military roll.
This instant orders are jfl'ued to
the emigrants to <]uit Liege, Montmedy
and Trevet, to prevent the eleifloiates
from being attacked on their account.

STRASBOURG, May 8
The declaration of war, by the Aflem
bly, has produced here the mod live
ly emotions of joy.âOur troops are
in high fpivits, and eager to engage
the mercenaries of Austria.. This,
in a great measure, is due to the fkil
ful arrangements, zeal, anil patriot
ifen of Marechal Luckner. This of
ficer poflefles in the highelt degree
the confidence of the army, and if
conduced by him, will do every thing
that men can do. He is one of those'
few men who can derive advantages
even from misfortune. The late dil
aftrous events at M<ms and Tournay,
have determined him to enforce the
niolt rigid discipline, to prevent such
disasters in future,,and ensure success.
The following is the addrefshe made
to his army 011 this fubjevfi, on the
jth instant.
" Marechal Luckner informs the
army and the citizens that have taken
up arms for the maintenance of liber
ty, that the whole amount of the
killed in the repulse from Mons and
Tournay, is about one hundred and
fifty men. The Marechal is fully sen
sible that this failure of success can
not but re-animate the courage of all
true Frenchmen. He well knows
they are worthy to be a free nation,
and as such capable of ftruggiing a
gainst the blasts of adveil'e fortune.
By a steadiness and resolution, cha
rafteriftic of brave men, who are
fighting for their lights, they will
soon learn how tocirryofF the vic
tory from hostile mercenaries.â As to

It was this lenfe, Sir, of your pub

Tf which Mr, Jay made the following
â reply :
Gentlemen,
IT is far more pleasing to receive
proofs of ihe confidence and attach
ment of my native city, than it is ea
sy to express the sense which that con
fidence and that attachment inspire.
When I reflect on the facrifices and
efforts in the cause of liberty, which
diflinguiftied this state during the
late war, my feelings are very sensi
bly affected by the favorable light in
which yon regard my conduct during
that interesting period. That cause
was patronized by him who gave
to men the rights we claimed : He
crowned it with success, and made it
intlrumental to our enjoying a de
gree of national prosperity, unknown
to any ot her people : â May it be per
petual ! Such is our constitution, and
fucli are the means of procuring or
derand good government, with which
we are blefled, that while ourcitizens
remain virtuous, free, and enlighten
ed, few political evils can occur, for
which remedies perfectly effectual,
and yet perfectly confident with ge
nera] tranquility cannot be found and
applied.
I derive great fatisfacftion from .the
hope and expectation that the event
which at present excites fn much a
larm and anxiety, wijl give occafton
only to such measures as patrjotifin
may direift and jultify ; and that the
vigilance and wisdom of the people
will always afford to their rights that
protection, for which other countries,
less informed, have often too preci
pitately recurred to violence and com
motion.
In qneftions touching our constitu
tional privileges, all ihe citizens are
â¢qually interelled ; and the I'ocial
duties call upon U3 all to unite in dif
cufling these queltions ' with candor
and temper, in deciding them with
circumspection and impartiality, and
in maintaining the equal lights of all
with conllancy and fortitude.
They who do what they haven
right to do, give no jolt cavif'e of of
fence ; and therefore every consider.
ation of propriety forbids that dif
ferences in opinion refpeifting candi
dates, {honld suspend or interrupt thai
mutual humor and benevolence
which harmonizesfociety,and foftens
the asperities incident to human life
and human affairs.
By those free and independent e
lecftors who have given me their fuf
frages, I efteein my ("elf honored ; â
for the virtuous who withheld that
mark of preference, I retain, and
ought to retain, my former refpecfi
and good will âto all 1 wish proiprri
ty, public and private. Permit me,
gentlemen, to aflure you, and'your
constituents, that as 1 value their es
teem, and rt-joice in their approbati
on, (o it will always be my delirc, as
well as my doty, tojuftify as far as
poilible, ihe fcntiments which they
entertain ot me : and which you, Sir,
have exprefled in terms, and in a
manner, which demand, and which
eceive, my warm ell acknowied:*-

Nothing extraordinary happ cljl ,Â« t m V

that the crew once or twice complain

o'clock at night, the mate's watch be
jing Â°n deckâone of the crew called
I him, telling him that there was j
Dolphin a head ; the mate went for',

of the crew Hi nek him with an'axi.
and knocked him down, another <nve
him two or three (li okes with a knife
and threw him into the sea. Jhev
then called the captain and told him
that the mate had fallen overboard :
He came up, and as he fat his foot oil

over as the mate.
The crew went down and awoke
an old French sailor, the cook, and a
young woman whom the captain had
brought with him from Savannah ;
informed tliein of what had happen

they would not promile lecrecy on
the aflurance they gave of not reveal

and ihe murderers went in the cabin
and fat down the reft of the night,
eating and drinking. The next day
they divided the captain's and mate's
clothes and motley, and brought up
on deck a watch and iilver buckles
which were fold at vendue On
Thnrfday the 2:d they discovered the

BALTIMORE, July 14.
A correfpoiirfent observes (on the
paragraph copied from the National
Gazettt, in our paper of Thursday lalt)
that it is generally, if not always, a
proof of partiality or design, when a
pubii/her or conductor of a :':ewfpa
per is uniform inexpofingto liisread
ers but one ltde of a queftionâKor
example, it is not fair to stigmatize
the law of Cottgrefs refp'fting nrjjffa
\pers with having for its object the pre
vention of dominating the proceedings
of Cortgreft, and to hold up a majority
of the members of Congress as ene
mies to the liberties of the People. In
the firft place, the law ailuded to
obliges the poft-office to convey all
exchange papers, to and from print
ers, within the United States, jres of
pofiageâthereby enabling the print
ers in the several States to give due
anil regular information to the peo
ple of the proceedings of Ctngreji â
So far therefore from Hopping infor
mation at the feat of government, it
iias rendered its transmission to the
several States more certain than here
tofore âSecondly, the law does not
prevent, but anthorifei the printer!
in the several States to fend their pa
pers to their cullomers in any man
ner they might find most convenient.
!t dees not compel them to employ
the mail stages ; and allows them to
nfe any other. In tins refpeift, there

the smallest degree, the diffpminat.oit
of newfpa-pers or cangre^ttH"!proceeu

that the regulation in (jueltion is cal- (
calated to ensure the circulation of
newl'papers by annexing to them the
faille facrednefs and protection as to
letters, while the pottage is perhaps
less than they would be carried for
by a contract made by each printer,
taking into the account certainty and
regularity of delivery, which every
subscriber will naturally coHfider of

A writer in the New-York Gazette, on re
storing suspended animation, fays, that the im
mediate causes of death in a drowned person,
are the want of vital air, with loss qf tone in
[tiie moving fibres of the heart it.'elf.
This being admitted, the great object will
be to renew the aftiort of the heart and arteries,
by obviating tiie cautes which have interrupted
their action ; this is to be effected by three in
tentions :
ift. By restoring the heat and refpiiacion ;
this is to be accQinplilhcd, ift- By wiping die
body as dry as pofiible, and then by applying a
gradual uniform degree of heat, either by plac
ing it before a fire, simmering it in a warm
bathe, exposing it to the fun, by the warmth of
another person's body, or by covering it with
warm grains, warm allies, warm sand or fait,
or lastly by rubbing it with warm clothes. 2d.
By repeatedly inflating the lungs, imitating the
alternate motions of natural respiration ; ti i
can be done either by inserting a tube ip the
windpipe, or as recommended by Dr. Monro, by
inserting it into one of the nostrils.
2d. By more immediately reflcring the aftioi.
ofthe moving fibre-.,the means for anfweringtms
intention are, frifliovSy injections of tobaccoJmoke,
vomiting* warm stimulating drinks, &rc.
1 And 3d. By leflening the quanty of blood,
thereby promoting its circulation ; this is only
| to be effected by blood letting, in the use of this
' remedy however some caution is necelfary, left
Iwe take more blocd than is fnfficient to fulfil
I this intention.
These directions have been found repeatedly
fuccefsful.

I cannot help giving it as my opinion that it

produced was by far too (lender, on which to
have determined a matter of much less impor
tance. I despise the person who made the affi

under pretence of believing it, condemned my

me that I was fufpe&ed.âl know that I have
a conscience, and that I fultain a charafrer
which will support me under all the calumnies

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
THE Government of the United States has
been compared to a fhij - âwe like the fiiriHc ;
the lhip is thank heaven now under an easy lail,
with a chosen complement of officers and men;
the crew contented and happyâevery man un
derstands his duty, and leduloufly performs itâ
the prol'pect is flatteringâand though the voyage
is long, the concerned have every reason to
hope for the most prosperous issue to the adven
i ture.
There are some fellows who wMhed to enter,
but all the births being taken up, they were not
receivedâand it appears fortunate âfor there
is great reason to suppose they would have railed
a mutiny on boardâthey turn out to be a que
rulous unealy gangâand are fabricating and
Circulating the most infamous reports reflecting
the voyage the officers and menâit will not
fault if the enterprize does not finally
â¢msfvarryâand Â£he fliip founder, or be run on ti c
rocks or quick lands, and there be stove to pie
ces.âThese fellows have a few emissaries or.
various parts of the coast, who hang out falfe
lights and make other falfe signalsâbut the con
cerned repoie the fulleft confidence in the wis
dom and honor of the commander, officers and
crew ; they know them to be old sailors, that
they have been tried and proved in tempestu
ous seasons, and have never failed bringing the
{hip into a iafe port, and are firmly persuaded
that the present voyage will be the molt prof
j perous ever undertaken.
" AHoufe divided against itfelf cannot stand.
This is a quotation !Vom a certain book, which
contains doctrines highly important to the in
terest:. of society and of men. There was a
time whi nits full import was felt by the good
people of this cour.tr* âand tfcey snow realize
the bleflcd efeas. To perfect and perpetuate
the Union of this confederated republic, the
genius of Columbia brought us from the foun
tain of wisdom, the preient constitution of the
United States, that new bond of amity and
(trcngthâthis cemented our councils, gave us
laws & fecuritvâtreated a firm basis for our ere
ciitâgave wings to our commerceâhope to our
nianuiaftures, and nerved the arm of' agriail-
tare. It opened the strong boM of the miser ;
biafted a baseless paper mediumâbuilt a strong
tower of public and private confidence, and
what is more than allâdefined government,
and laid in the principles of equal representa
tion, so broad a foundation for civil liberty,
that the people of the United States can never
be enflavecl, except they enilave themselves ;
and this they never xviil do till by the arts of
unprincipled men, they Ihallbe induced to think
contemptibly of their union and government.
There is no leafon to think that a change of
mcafures, without a change of wen jn refpeff to
the government of the United States, would fa
tlsfy the present set of grumblers ; habituated
to a complaining, fault-finding temper, there is
no other way of silencing tliefe croakers, but
by giving them, as the.song, fays, " something
clfe to do."
It is Taid in Tome of the northern paper* that
the complaints against the measures of govern
ment proceed principally from adilaffefted jun
to at the southward ; this idea cannot be sup
posed tl} extend further fcutli than the feat of
government âfor excepting now and then a
stray paragraph, produced probably in the only
hotbed of antifederal politics in the Union, there
is scarcely a. single idea of difaffeftion to the
measures of goverrmentto be found in a months'
publication of all the newspapers printed at the
southward of Philadelphiaâand there one paper
only, enjoys the singular honor of depreciating
the government, by publication?, which if
founded in the least semblance of truth would
justly render it more deteliable th;,n the old
despotism of France.
The present situation aud circumflances of
the United States, contrasted with what they
were in 1787, is a point blank refutation of
the flanders of that antifederal junto, which
labored so incessantly, but ineffectually to pro
crastinate the happinel's of this country by pre
venting the adoption of the new Constitution.
"tfhis juilto, reduced to a very small number,
haa left-its influence, but has not loft its ve
nomous di"positionâit has loft its prudence f.iid
consistency, if it ever poflefled either, but has
not loft its propcnfity to mvfehief.
The Constitution of the United States is re
publicanâit is founded on the people, the only
legitimate source of powerâthe friends of this
Conftitntion are principled in republicanismâ j
they imbibed republican sentiments with their I
mother's 'milkâthey were nurtured and educa
ted in the dodtrines.of equal rights and equal'
libertyâand yet so confident is the junto, that
they accuse those men who have fought to efta
nlifh the freedom of this country (for these are
the men who Compose the administration of the
government) as calumniators of republicanism;
as agents to a factiou (sometimes it is a f.ifiion
itfelf) who are " paving the way to hereditary
monarchy on the fly destruction of popular go
vernment." It it hardly pofiible to conceive
that the' authors of J'uch paragraphs can be so
Weak as to behei'C what they write.
â¢ ,A coi'refpondent observes, that the enemies j
'of ouv peace are not only mortified at the fuc
cefsful operation of the measures of government
but they appear to be ve?:ed and chagrined that
the people arc contentedâand more so that
they ibou'd acknowledge that ttyeir iituation is
prosperous and happy.
It is really difficult to determine with what
propriety the terrrt faClion is applied to the friends
of chose measures of government which have
retrieved the affairs of this country from that
wretched situation into which they were plunged
previous to the adoption of the constitutionâ
nnd yet these real confident and competent
fr-ends ef the people are net only denonuntted
a ai. uÂ»t Imt aTe xv'.tu great
called "proud ar.d vain worfiiippers ot' arilto
crr.cy and monarchy"âSurely " tj:e grate of
impudence is a growing grace." But the peo
ple oftiiC United Sates are fully apprized of the
, ;. a ,â trs and views of those perlons who are
â¢adepts in nothing but finding fault.âTheir ob
ject is too apparent to be miflaken ; for, said
d gambler, " I must complain thatthe cards are
badly fla.fficd, till I have .a good hand."

[epjw]EXTRACT PROM THE ZENITH OF GLORY
A MANUSCRIPT ODE.
Sir Peter Parker's and General Clinton's Attack on
Port Sullivan, 1776.
Q IR Peter, loosed the bellying fail;
His squadron caught the riling gale,
And swept the wat'ry plain ;
With them, in priile of warlike force,
Erave Clinton ihap'd an equal course,
For Charle/lon * rich domain.
Forth from the camp with rapid haste,
Athwart a funbuint, sultry waste,
Zee's chosen columns sped :
Nor fwiftcr posts the rufbjng Heed
When urg'd along with doubling speed,
Earth scarcely feels him tread.
Now past the Ihelving sand forin'd bar,
At once begamtfee storm of war
Wild pouring on in flame.
Here Paikcr's the tar infpirM,
'â There Moultrie's voice his soldiers tir'd,
And Jafpcr purchased fame.
On purpled billows (laughter rode.
From deck to deck fell carnage strode.
Death fought the boldâthe brave.
fJeav'n, earth and sea were veii'd in fmolce,
ShaUs, mortars, cannon, raging broke,
Borne upward from the wave.
In vain the toilâfirm, unsubdued,
The itrong Palme toe tow'ring flood,
From dawn, till darkling night
When the whifft ensign's given sign,
Recalled the fhatter'd, finking line,
Arid clos'd the horrid fight.
