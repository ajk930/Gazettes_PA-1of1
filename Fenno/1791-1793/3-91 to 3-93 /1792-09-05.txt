FOR .'HE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES
REPRESENTATIVES in CONGRESS
[The following remarks appear in xhe Herald
of Vek mont âthey are ingenious, liberal,
nationalâand having particular relation to the
important subjeCt of Representation, can
not be too extensively known. â The Author of
the Essays under the fignaturr of C. therefore
offers them as a substitute for No. 5, of his own
writingâfully convinced thatihe performance
w il meet the approbation of every candid
reader.J
IT is of great importance, that the commu
nity ihould be properly represented. The
true principles of representation require, that
every interest, which is of national consequence,
ftiould be proportionably represented in the Le
gislature. The interests of Arts, Sciences,
Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures,have
an equal claim to attention. On a due atten
tion to all these, depends the highest prosperity
of a nation. Agriculture is, perhaps, the firft,
and rvjft extensive interest ; but it can hardly
e.xift t ithotit th * aid of some inanufa<sture^âit
can never flourifh in any country, without the
aid both of manufactures and commerce, by
which the tiller of the ground is enabled to ex
change his fuperfiuous productions for necefla
ries or conveniences, not otherwise within his
reach. It is the great business of legrflation, to
compromise the seeming opposition or' tiicfe in
terests, to give to each its due weight in the na
tional scale, and by this mean to render them,
as designed by Providence, reciprocally subser
vient to each other. As important as the in
terest of Agriculture is to society, it would be
not only unjust, but extremely pernicious to
the whole, to facrifice every other interest: to
this principal interest. Men, whose occupations
place them in one particular interest, may un
derstand it simply, and yet never have attended
to all its connections, so as to be able toeftimate
its jnft importance to society. All men, where
their immediate interest, or that of their class
is concerned, are subjeCt to a degree of delusion.
They are disposed to appreciate it too highly.
Such, however, are the men of whom legislatures!
inuft generally be composed; and thus the Intc-j
reftr., sentiments, manners, and pallions of the i
people, to which every law ought to be accom
modated, are individually brought forward to
discussion.
The science of legislation, in its failed extent,
comprehends a thorough knowledge of the prin
ciples of the government; of the manners, sen
timents, paftjons, and iuterefts of the people;
of the pursuits pointed out by the nature of
their situation ; of the means both of acquisition
and enjoyment; a knowledge of all national re
lations and connexions, internal and external;
of the moral, natural, and political influence of
measures. This science is exactly similar to I
the science of natural philosophy, in which, lit
tle or nothing can be known, without actual
experiment and observation ; without a clear
knowledge of causes, fubjefh and cffe&s, in all
their vast variety of combinations. It is evi
dent, that few men will be found to poflefs such
an extent and variety of knowledge. The de
ficiency mult be supplied by the knowledge
which individuals may acquire, of particular
parts. Each will have acquired a degree of
knowledge of those matters in which he is most
converfaut- He whose circle in life is more
confined, will be more confined in his know
ledge. He who is led to a<st in a more extensive
circle, comprehending a greater variety of ln
terefts, manners, and lentiments, will have a
more extensive knowledge, a greater fund of
that information, which is neceflary in legisla
tion.
No one interest ought to be negle&ed, or fa
crificed to another. No profeflion of men, no
class of citizens ought to be proscribed, no single
interest: toengrofs the dire&ion of national mea-
lures.
If* there be, among the class of Farmers,
Physicians, Merchants, Lawyers, or Manufac
turers, any men of known integrity of life, and
of more general information, who are able fully
to clilcern the importance of the several inter
ests, and their mutual connection in promoting
the national welfare, certainly narrow preju
dices ought not to deprive the people of the use
of such abiiities. Such men cannot fail to be of
the greatest fcrvice in a legislature, â¢ Is not the
present prosperity of these States to be, in a
good measure, attributed to an attention to
these principles in the choice of Representa
tives? A FREEMAN.
FROM THE CONNECTICUT COURANT.
ExtraCt of a letter from Bucks County.
" Last year we had no apples in this neigh
bourhoodâthe present year God has blessed us
with abundance, but an insolent Excife-Oflicer
is placed over us to prevent our making use of
this bounty of Heaven, as we think bestâThis
is the boasted liberty of the Federal Govern
ment." {Phi I ad. hid. Gaz.)
Such grievances are not a little ridiculous.â
u Last year we had no apples; this year God
has given us a plenty, and we may drink cider
duty free ; but cider is not fiery enough for the
throats of freemen, and if we diftill it into hot
[Whole No. 350.]
ardent spirits, that make our throats tingle, we
have jeveral cents to pay to government." A
mighty grievance ! and will freemen bear all
this ?âAn Excise Officer ! Why the col left or of
a land tax is a civil man; but appoint the fame
man to collect a duty on gin and xvhijky, and what
a devil he is ! Pimps and negro drivers are no
thing to him ! Sp much for prejudices acquired
in another country and under flavilh laws ; for
these violent grumbletonians, many of them at
least, were born abroad.
No. V
But all their grumbling has no effecft The
laws of* the nation are generally ageeable to the
communityâthe execution of them gives no
general uneasiness. The complaints of a few
four restless minds in the back parts of Pennsyl
vania and Virginia, produce no great effect in
the counties where they are echoed, and in eve
ry other part of the Union, they are treated
with their merited contempt. They proceed
from narrow-minded men, whose views, like
those of the pismire, are limited to the hillock
where, they live. Men who can take a com
prehend ve view of government, in all its de
partments and connections, juftify the nicafures
taken to raise money in the United States. In
deed in the northern States, people of all de
scriptions, though the price of spirits has been
raised within a year almost fifty per cent, not
onlv approve of the funding as", the duty
and the regulations of the Poll-office, but they
feel no small degree of gratitude to the Execu
tive officer and to Congress, who have planned
the present system of adminifcration. A com
plaint is scarcely heard in these states, norwould
the people willingly fee the fyflem altered in
the minuted particularâBut " offences mufl
come and when a fpir.it of censure and com
plaint exists in the body, it is best it lhould find
vent. Newspapers are the convenient vehicles
to carry off this spirit, and grumbletonians arc
the men to do the work. Every large town
must have a grumbling paper or two : they are
the common sewers of public opinion, and very
ufeful in discharging the filth of four minds, and
the dregs of wrong heads. The moving of this
filth is a little difagrceable for a moment to the
by-ftanders. but is necefTary to preserve the air
pure and salubrious. CATO.
CAPTURE OF SERINGAPATAM
FROM THE ST. CHRH>TOriIER'i GAZETTE.
MADRAS, March I
Camp,- Seringapatam, 24,1792.
LORD has great
pleasure in announcing to the
army, that preliminaries of peace
have been fettled between the confe
derate powers and Tippoo Sultan,
containing conditions highly honora
ble and advantageous to the Compa
ny, and the British Nation ; and in
consideration of the uncommon va
lor and fhmnefs that has been shewn
maiiifeftly by the officers and soldiers
of the king's and company's troops,
during the whole course of the war,
it is his Lonlfhip's intention to take
upon himfelf to order a handsome
gratuity to be diHiibuted to them
in the fame proportion as prize
money, from the sum that Tip
poo has bound himfelf by one of
the articles to pay to the Company
It has been agreed that from thia
day hostilities (hall cease on both
fides, but the army is not only to re
tain its present posts till further or
dersâbut his Lordship likewise en
joins in the ftrongett manner, that
no troops, nor persons belonging to
Tippoo shall be allowed to pass the
Picquet and approach the encamp
ment without a paflportor permiilion
regularly notified, and in general,
that the fame vigilance and ftriiflneft
that has been customary during the
war, lhall be observed by all officers
and soldiers in the execution of every
military duty, until the troops (hall
arrive at the port that shall be allot
ted to them, in the Company's terri
toriesâHis Lordfliip thinks it almost
unneceflary to desire the army to ad
vert, that moderation infuccefs, is no
less expeÂ«sied from brave men, than
gallantry in action, and he trusts that
the officers and soldiers in his army,
will not only be incapable of com
mitting violences in any intercourse
that may happen between them and
Tippoo's troops, but that they will
even abltain from making use of any
kind of an insulting expreflion to
wards an eneuiy now fubdocd and
humbled.GRAND ARMY
On our arrival near this place o.i
the sth in ft. Tippoo's army appeared
encamped 011 the north ot the Cave
ry, his rear to the island ot Seiinga
pat am. His right extending to the
toot of the hill 011 which the Carlgat
ta Pagoda ttands, and his left to the
Cavery above ihe island. Ihe Lock
any river which winds through the
plain to the northward ot Seringapa
tain, ran clole along part ot the 11 out,
and round the right of his line,where
it joined the Cavery, and several wa
ter coiirfes,ravines, and much Iwa 111 py
ground, ilrengtheiied his left.
The whole of his encampment was
enclol'ed with a bound hedge, in ma
ny places extremely impenetrable,
and several ftrongand well conftruift
ed redoubts, furniihed with a nume
rous artillery, were so placed as to
defend Hie approach, particularly to
wards the left of his polition.
This encampment having been re
connoitred 011 the morningofthe 7th,
orders were i(Tiled in the evening for
a general attack 011 the lines. âThe
army in three divilions commanded
by Lord Cornwallis, Gen. Meadows,
and Col. Maxwell, without guns, was
ordered to parade at feveti in the e
vening.
Gen. Meadows, with the right co
lumn, to enter on the left of the
enemy's camp, Lord Cornwallis to
attack their centre, and Colonel Max
well to gain the Carigatta Pagoda,
and the hill commanding it ; 011
which works had been conttrudled by
the enemy to defend their right.
The right and centre attacks were
directed to penetrate nearly to the
depth of the enemy's camp before
they turned to sweep along it, and
the whole were inftrutfted in the e
vent of success to fuffer their leading
diviHons to mix with the fugitives,
and if possible to enter the island with
them.
About nine o'clock the column
moved off, and at I 2 the attack com
menced on the left in, the centre.
The hills were rapidly carried by
Col. Maxwell's diviiion, and after a
fliarp contest for several minutes, the
centre column penetrated the hedge,
and put the enemy to flight.
Lieut. Col. Knox, with the leading
companies of his attack, pufliing the
fugitives, entered the island with
them at the great ford close to the
fort, and advanced across it, while
Coi. Stuart, with the 71ft regiment
and two sepoy battalions took a very
llrong redoubt, and drove the enemy
to his left, along the camp. Here
they were met by the column under
Lieut. Col. Maxwell, who quitting
the hills, had attacked the right of
the camp, and was forcing the enemy
towards the centre.
Anxions to pufli the advantage as
far as poflible, the leading part of the
left column under Col.Baird entered
the river, and attempted it by a very
rugged paflage, in which attempt Col.
Stuarts division joined.
The depth and rocky bottom of
the river, with a heavy fiie from the
lines, formed to defend it on the op
posite bank, for a considerable time
prevented the progress of the troops ;
but after more than an hour's exer
tion, the 71ft and 72d regiments, got
footing on the opposite bank, nearly
at the fame time that the few compa
nies who had pafl'ed at the proper
ford, and penetrated across theifland
to the southern river, returned to
wards the Pettah of Charganjain,
which was now taken pofleilion of by
the troops which had eroded.
The (hong lines which defended
the holdânear the Carigatta Pago
da, being now abandoned bytheene
my, several Sepoy corps eroded here,
and reinforced the troops already on
the island, so that by two o'clock in
the morning, all the eastern part of
the place, including the gardens of
Tippoo, the Tomb of Hyder, and
Charganiam (a Pettah on the centre
of the iflind) was taken by our troops.
In this Pettah a number of our un
fortunate countrymen were found in
chains, and released, as well as many
of the topafes taken at Coimbatore,
with Lieut. Chalmers.
While the centre and left divisions
were thus employed, Gen. Meadows,
whose march had been impeded bv
bad roads till after the attacks 011 the
other fide had commenced, entered
the hedge near a -very strong re
doubt, which the advance cf his di
vision under Col. Neibiti immediately
attacked
A considerable body of the enemy's
best troops, am.onglt whom was Lal
ly's corps, defended poit, and
the ilrength ot tlie work, which
mounted len pieces 6i' cann Â» i, to
gether with the ohitinaie reiiftance
of its defenders, made its reduction
an operation ofcoiiiiderable difficulty.
After several attacks had been made
and as often repnlfed, w it h great loss.
our troops at lail gained and eritered
tlie redoubt ; upwards of 300 of: the
enemy falling within it.
The delay occasioned by thisobfti
tiate defence, and some miltakes
which our little knowledge of the
exac r t (ituation of the camp (objected
us to, prevented the column from pe
netrating on this tide as far as was
intended, so that the lefc wing of the
enemy remained in a great degree
unbroken, while this column moved
to the left along the outside ot the
hedge, inltead of keeping within it,
and came 110 more into action during
the night.
Lord Cornwallis, with part of the
centre column, had remained near
the foot where the column had enter
ed the hedge to (u ft a ill the attacks if
neceflaiy, and be at hand to coimnu
nicate his orders to the whole.
About four in the morning, the e
neiny collecting from their left, which
had not been touted like the relt of
their army, came down in a very for
midable body, and attacked thefmall
force that remained near his Lord
fliip's person.
The attack was warm, and reso
lutely received by the 74th, and pari
of the J2d regiments, with two bat
talions of Madras Sepoys and three
companies of the 13th Bengal Sepoys.
The enemy were repeatedly charg
ed and broken, bur as often formed
again, and renewed the attack, with
a constant fire of cannon, rockeis,
and inufquetry. Removed from the
support of the reft of the army, and
ignorant of their situation, it became
necefiary, as day approached, to re
tire from under the range of; he can
non of the fort.âThe corps charged
and broke the enemy, and profiting
by their confufion, retired in good
order to the hedge at the footofCar
rigatt hills, where they were joined
by Maj. Gen. Meadows' division : at
the fame time the troops in the island
abandoned the Pettah, and several
of the advanced posts they had gain
ed, as they did not think it prudent
to risque the loss of rhe advantages
tliey were certain of pofl'effing, from
fecuringa smaller extent in the island,
by attempting to maintain more polls,
than the number of men they had
were capable of defendingâefpecial
ly ns they were not fufficiently ac
quainted with the situations to judge
of their strengthâat day light we
were enabled to view the scene of
action, and mark the efrects of the
night attack.âAll the encampment
of the enemy appeared in the great
cft confufionâmolt of the tents, a
mongst which was that of the Sultan,
ft'll standing ; guns and tumbrils,
laying fcatterfed over every part of
the lines, camels and bullocks wan
dering about, and horses galloping
amort git the dead and dying, wholaj
in heaps along the ground. Shelter
ed by the fire of the fort, the enemy
collected in great bodies, and cover
ed by large parties of horse attempt
ing to carry off the remains of their
tents and storesâbut a redoubt near
ly in the center of their camp, into
which Capt Sibbald, with a company
of the 7111 regiment and two of Se
poys, had been thrown during the
night by Col. Stuart, in a great mea
sure prevented their operations.
' here redoubts thev surrounded
and during the whole of the 7rh, at'
tempted by every means to force
ihey were conflantly beat off, and
front the Hills and Islands we witr.efl
ed the interetting spectacle of a fmal!
work which we had the night before
earned with the greatell ease, iâ lhe
mid It of r ippoo's army, refiftinjr all
his force, which repeatedly aflaulted
itâtowards evening the enemy re
tiredl abandoning all their works on
this fide the River, after blowing up
the umbilis, and burning some of
the carnages of their guns; and altho'
levei al of the guns we had taken dn
ring the night were drawn oft' by
110
them in the course of the day, 76 pie
ces of fine cannon, remained in pof
feiiion.âNothing but tile neighbour-]
hood of the Fori, the guns of which
commanded all the plain, enabled
.Tippoo 10 lave one of his field artil
lery. The camp equipage being
brought from the former ground on
the evening of the 7ih, the army en
camped fronting Sei ingapatam, and
as near the place as the range of the
lliot would permit.
Our loss in the action is not nearly
so great a& might have been expect
ed, when the circumltances of the
attacks are considered, the whole a
inount of killed and wounded not ex
ceeding 520. The proportion of ofH
cers is great, but moil of thole wound
ed aie doing well.âT he lols of the
enemy cannot be ascertained. By the
most probable accounts their killed
and wounded are 5000, their deser
tions in consequence of the defeat
near 20,000 âIt leems to have given
a decisive blow to the power ot the
Sultan, as his troops have loit all con
fidence. The Europeans in his ser
vice are defer ting, whenever they
have an opportunity of doing (o, and
many of these molt ufeful to him,
are among the number already come
to cam J).
In our lad courier we anticipated
the arrival of the hollages in camp.
âli was on the 27th, instead of the
24th, nit. that the important event
took place - about twelve o'clock tiie
works of the fort of Seringapatam
wei e crowded with an innumerable
multitude of people ; and the Sultan
was plainly clifcovered amongst them.
â111 a few minutes afterwards the
young princes made their appearance,
they were conduc r ted from the island
â o a large pavilion pitched lor their
reception, near Sibbald's redoubt,
aboMt a mile from the fort.
Here they were received by Sirjohn
Kenneway, who attended tlieni, ac
companied by an escort, to liead-quar
ters.
On entering the cainp, they were
fainted with nineteen guns ; and the
part of the line they palled was un
der arms, and the officers fainted â
Lord Cornwallis saluted them in his
tent, which was guarded by a bat
talion of Sepojs ; and they were then
formally delivered over to his Lord-
Ihip, by Gullum Ally Beg, the Sul
tan's Vackeel, as hollages for the due
performance of the treaty.
The scene was grand and affecting,
and imprerted all present with those
feelings which are not easily deliue
ated
It was a proud scene to the conque
rorsâit was the moll humiliating to
( O
the vanquifheo.
An awful lilence for a moment pre
vailed, and every one seemed absorb
ed in the tumult of which the
occasion naturally called forth.
At length Gulium Ally approach
ing Lord Coi nwallis, and under much
agitation, addrelled his Lord/hip in
tha following emphatic words "1 hefe
children," said he, pointing to the
young princes, whom he then pre
sented, " were this morning the sons
of the Sultan my matterâtheir situa
tion is changed, and they must now
look up to your Lordfliip as their fa
ther," âand the tender and affection
ate manner in which his Lord (hip re
ceived them, seemed to confirm the
truth of the expi ellion.
The attendants of the young prin
ces appeared astonished at what they
saw, and their countenances were
highly expressive of the fatisfaiSion
they felt in the benevolence of his
Lordship.
Some conversation took place be
tween His Lordship and ilie Vackeels
of Tippoo, in which the latter de
clared that the termination of the
war difFufed happiness throughout all
ranks of people, and after fining a
few minutes, they retired, accompa
nying the young Princes to their
Tents ; under the escort of a party of
our Troops, which remained with
them as their guard.
Before they took their leave, His
Lordship presented a gold watch to
each of rhein, as a mark of his regard.
The next morning his Lordship
made them a visit a t their Tents,
which are pitched near to the left of
Tippoo's redoubts.
1 he body guard and spearmen of
1 lie Princes, formed an avenue of con
siderable extent from the Tent of ce-
i-emoiiy, which is fpacioiil, ail
magnificent. .
His Lordfliip alighted at the end c f
the avenue, and walked up t0 u, e
Tent, saluted as he palled by
Pi ince's guai ds.
They met his Lordlhip at the en
trance, and by their refpeftful be'
havior, {hewed that they held i u
pleating remembrance the kind at.
tention his Lordfliip had lhewn t0
them.
At the extremity of the Tent, and
somewhat elevated, a number of chairs
were placed ; here his Lordship f eat .
eel himfelf with the eldest Prince on
his right hand, and the younger oil
his left.

The Varkeels ot Tippoo of whom
one was the person fen't fotne time a
go on an embafly to Conftaiuiliople,
and thole of the Nizam and Marraitas
arranged themselves in the fame or
der ; so that the whole formed a fe
rn i-circle : after a conversation of a
bout an hour, in which the Conllan
tinople Ambassador bore a consider
able share, his Lordship embraced the
Princes and gave to theeldeila fufee
richly mounted, and to the yomigelt,
an elegant cafe of pistols, and in re
turn each of them prefemed his Lord
ship with a sword ; beetle and Ottar
weie then broughc in, and his Lord
ship immediately afterwards with
drew, leading a prince in each hand,
to the extremity of the rich carpet
which was spread on the ground and
embraced them with the utmoll cor
diality. They remained on the spot
some time, paying their compliments
to the gentlemen of his Lordfliip's
li'uite, who falured them.
They are very fine boys; the eldest
is about eleven years of age, and ap
pears to be very quirk, (hrewd, and
penetrating : He addressed his Lord
(hip in a very pertinent speech, with
a great deal of propriety and without
any kind of confufion or embarrafl
nietn, and in the fame manner, 011
being defned by Gullum Ally, he re
peated some paflages from the Koran.
The youngest is remarkably hand
someâhis features are very regular
and expreflive, and his countenance
is mild and open, lie is about 7 years
of a g e âThey are both very graceful,
perfectly correct in their manners,
and appear to be extremely well bred.
They were drefled in white mus
lins, and round their necks they wore
fonie rows of beautiful pearls,to which
were suspended a peftagon, consisting
of an emerald and a ruby of consi
derable size, surrounded with a pro

WARSAW, June 2.
Ycfterd'.iy an express from Prince Joseph Po
iiiatowfki arrived with the following account,
dated at Vienna the 27th of May:âLieutenant
Oolciowfki of the National Cavalry, occupying
ail out-poft with three hundred men, perceived
a body of 2300 Ruffians approaching, who firft
began the attack, while Golciowfki having re
turned the fire, charged the enemy lword in
hand with such impetuosity, that their line was
compleatly broken ; a general action then be
gan, which lasted two hours and an half. Not
withstanding so great a superiority of numbers,
the field of battie remained to our troops; 33Â®
Ruffians were left on the spot; our lols is 43
killed and 23 wounded This body of the Ruf
fians was chosen from the nation called Czarno
morce, bordering on the Black Sea, reckoned
tjie bravest ; it is they who took Berezina, near
Oczakow, and who led tfie van in storming 11-
mailow. Elated with former fucCelTes, and
trusting to their numbers, they marched down
with seeming contempt, and littleexpefted such
a warm reception from a handful,of Poles.
Our different divisions are marching to Lithu
ania and to the Ukraine, with the greatest ex
pedition and alacrity. They had not a single
dei'erter. In Lithuania we fee the greatelt ardor
for defending their liberty and independence.
Even their ladies strive to encourage the youth
to noble actions ; instead of cries and tears, un
worthy of free women, they collected among
themselves 1,533 ducats at Wilora, for the ex
pences of the war.
We hear from the diftrift of Rzeczvca, that
the Ruffians have entered on that defenceless
fide, and begun to carry off all the peasants and
their families into ilaverv, to people their de
farts. Such are the proofs of the friendly as
surances given in the Empress's declaration.
LONDON, June 23.
By private letters from Paris, we learn, that
that capital is at present in extreme dilorder.
The late changes in the adminiflration, and
the firmnefs ofÂ°the King's reiiftance to certain

ple to the world. May it lie that of popular
afcsndency used with mildness and moderation!
A deputation of the citizens of the Sediion of

terms
" For the four last years the people have
been ailailed with plots, which seem to have

led to fanftion them ! You disbanded a Guard
audaciously aristocratic, and he hath recurned

clamation ! Most excellent Ministers formed
his Council â'ie hath difmilfed them !
" This hath given us the most lively
alarm. We wish to carry terror to the hearts
of the Conlpirators, and to teach them that the
Constitution shall never perish, as long as one
of its Defenders remains alive.

BOSTON, August 27.
In addition to the Foreign Intelligence, wc
can briefly addâThat Pari , continued in great
fermentâThat the King dared not appear it:
publicâThat vast numbers were daily leaving
FranceâThat the change in the French admi
nistration, as proceeding folcly from the King,
was deemed the 1110 ft important event that
could ever have taken place ; the iflue is ex
pected to be either a counter-revolution, or the
aflaffination of the KingâThat the King of
Hungary was not dead, but was very ill; âand
that the British government had equipped for
sea a fleet of observation, under Lord Hood.
We are forrv to inform the public, that the

or licence. I forgot in my last to mention to
you I discovered seven islands in the South Seas,
which I am sure from an examination of the dif

My journals being on board, puts it out of my

However, the French ship I mentioned to you
in my last, arrived here from the >3. W. law
of them, and claimed them as a new dif

111 our last it was. mentioned that Mr.Napper

es JÂ°hn Toler, Esq. the King's Solicitor Gene

above trial appear in an Etiglifh paper.
" That in lupport of the indictment, charg
ing Mr. Tandy with endeavoring, by letters
and otherwise, to excite and provoke Mr. To
ler to fight, it was allowed by Mr. Tandy, that
he did write the letters fpecifiedâand Mr. Smith,
Mr. Tandy's friend, declared in evidence, his
beliefâthat Mr. Tandy meant to provoke Mr.
Toler to fightâand wijhed to put the necejfity of
challenging on Mr. Toler.âMr. Tandy, never
tbelefs, was acquitted of endeavoring to excite Mr.
Toler to jght.
Mr. Tandy considered Mr. Toler to have gi
ven the offence, and accordingly called on him
for an explanation ; âyet strange to findâMr.
Tandy expected that Mr. Toler would lend
him (the affronted party) the challenge.
It is evident Mr. Toier was for fettling mat
ters inftantlvâand it is as evident, that Mr.
Tandy's backwardness to fight, increaled in pro
portion to Mr. Toler's forxvardnefs. Yet this
hero of heroesâthis redoubtable Napper Tandy,
was chaired after his acquittal, and illumina
tions made on his account, that his courage, it is
presumed, might appear the more conjpicucus.
Extract of a letter from a person in a dijlanl State

to the Editor.
" Nothing can shew more plainly the ill dis
positions of certain slanderers of government,
than their misrepresentations of the Poll-Office
law. They (tick at nothing to blacken the cha
racters of our rulers. It seems, on trial of the
Poft-Office law, impoflible that even such lrien
as the writers of scandalous paragraphs, Ihould
be hardy enough to charge the authors of that
law with a design to stop the newspapers and to
deprive the people of any means of knowing
how their affairs are managed. Not to men
tion that the provisions of that art carry on
their very face a strong desire to diffufe politi
cal information, experience has Ihewn already
that the law is well calculated for that purpose.
For it is well known that your papers formerly
came so seldom and so irregularly, that several
of your customers were discouraged and have
dropt your G; -.ette, notwithstanding their high
approbation of it, and their curiosity to under
stand public tranfartions. Since the firft of
June however, when the Poft-Oifice art came
into operation, I have not miffed receiving one
of your paper*, and I have no reason to appre
hend any difappointnient in future. 0

M. Rolland, one of the French Ministry, late
ly difmified, wrote the following letter to the
King on that occalion :
u Sire,
" The present state of things cannot conti
nue long; it is a violent crisis. The French
have made t! emfelves a conftitutior; this con- 1
liitution has made a number of malcontents.
The minority relying on culpable hopes, intrigue
with a high hand for the lupport of monarchy.
Your Majesty enjoyed great prerogatives, and
has not been able to bear the idea of losing them.
From this the enemies of the constitution have
counted upon secret prote&ion. Your Majesty
must at present chufe the alternative, either of
yielding up these habitudes, or of being fulpeft
ed of complicity. Every thing has its term ;
that of uncertainty is arrived. Will your Ma
jesty choole to defend the constitution, or to
range on the fide of the enemies of France?â
The declaration of rights is become the Evangil
of the people. Country is no longer a vain
word. The Revolution cannot but be com
pleated, even though it be terminated at the
price of blood. The Priests disturb the state ;
iandlion the decree which was intended to re
press them. Do not oppole the national will.
Sanction the decree for the levy of twenty thou
sand citizen soldiers."
A writer in one ot the Eastern papers, faysâ
" It is with singular plealure I obftrve the thriv
ing state of agriculttne, commerce, and arts in
every pat*t of the country I have visited. At no
former period of the last twenty-five years, have
people so gencrglly enjoyed the bltflings of pcace,
plenty and fatisfattion. It is a remark of farmers
in the interior country, that people were never be
fore so industrious, and never acquired property
so tafias at the present time. This industry is,
through the northern states, rewarded with the
molt plentiful crops ever known. Three years
;:gq industry languished, and multitude s of people
were wandering about the country in quest of
< mploymcnt. Day laborers were about the flreets
of our large towns in herds. But times are chang
ed. It is now almost lmpoifible to procure la
borers at any price. In the town and country
there is more employment than menâthe mecha
nic's undertaking retarded, and the farmers crops
wafting in the field for want of laborers. Even
emigration totheweftern lands is checked by this
lavorable state of btifinefs,
" Let the reader pause a moment and enquire
what is the cause of this new and unexpected
change of affairs. To what phyfical s moral or
political energy shall this flourifliing state of
things be alcribed ? There is but one anlwer to
tliefe enquiries ; Public credit is rejlorcd and ejla
bltjhed. The general government, by uniting,
and calling into action, the pecuniary rclources ol
the ftaies, has created a new capital stock of seve
ral millions of dollars, which, with that before
exifli ng ,\is dire&ed into every branch of bufintfs,
g'.ving life arid vigor to industry in its infinitely
divcVhfied operations. The enemies of the gene
ral government, the funding and the National
Bank, may bellow tyranny, arijlocracy and specula
tors ihiough the Union, and repeat the clamorous
din as long as ; but the attual Hate of
.gricubure and commerce, the peace, the content
merit and fatisfatf'on of the great mass of people,
;;ive the lie to their aflertions, and stamp on them
in capitals, Vox et praterea nihil. It is furpr.iftng
tliis pouting whining herd of dilappointed wiong
hcads will not be Jilent and retire with shame from
public notice, when they fee all their viiionary
predi6tions falfified, and instead of their eXpeded
calamities, thev fee the public mind at ease, and
.ill parts of the community congiatulating each
other on the full enjoyment of the bleflings of
peace, liberty, fafety and general prosperity.
One would think that baffled ambition itfelf
would retire from aflailingour ears and annoying
our bappinefs ; af;er having fcr two years mur
mured out its puny whinings m vain. But why
should government be exempted from the vexa
tions of harbonng toes in its bosom ? There was
a Judas among the difciplcs of Jesus, and the joys
of paradifc were interrupted by the leftlefs ambi
tion of a Satan. How then can the moil perfect
' fyflem of human government fatisfy all the wants
and wishes of its fnbje&s ?
" And little less than angels, would be more."
Those who deny that they are enemies of the j
government, and yet labor to undo all that the!
government has been three years in doing, af-i
fume all ihapes and use even contradictory pre
tences to carry their point. They call thern
felves firnple republicans, and they of course
abhor, as they afFedl to fay, the fine spun theo
ries and new fangled visions which Congress lias
adopted from the Minister of the Treasury.â
The irredeemable quality of the debt, the bank,
and almost all the principles drawn from ma
thematics, the most certain of the sciences, are
called schemes and visions with which the Se
cretary has bewitched the country. The fame
men do not however allow the merit of these
new invented schemes to the Secretary. Jea
lous of giving credit for any thing, they fay he
treads in the steps of the British financier. Ac
cording to these confident wife men, our sys
tems are at the fame time fanciful theories and
servile imitations of the pra&ice and experience
of other nations âthey want invention and they
have too much of itâthey are whims that no
perlon in his wits ever thought of before, and
they are dull and stupid because other nations
have done just so. This is blowing hot and
cold with the fame breath. But if the people
can be made to abhor the laws of Congress the
I end will juflify the means.
Thole who recommend good order and who
aid those who inculcate it will be right ninety
times out of an hundred ; for there will not
happen one occasion in a million when the peace
of society will not be found to be of more wort!
than any thing that the people will gain by dis
turbing it ; the agents of mifchief will gain,
though the people may fuffer ; for by blowing
up the coals of discord, they will be hired to
work at the bellows. Many political bullies
who wrangle themselves into places become ti;e
quieted men till they lose pofleflionâand ther
they have only to begin another fcjuabble.
COMMUNICATIONS.
That the debt of the United States is dimi
nished one million eight hundred forty-five
thou fan d two hundred seventeen dollars and
forty-two cents, is a fa(slâand that it is a fa<st
is the rubâit rubs off one of those raifreprefen
tations on which the junto founded their prin
cipal pretence to patriotilm. But as this fatffc
is so stubborn a testimonial in favor of the ad
ministration, it mud be obscured, and, if pofii
ble, overwhelmedâby what ?âby the abomi
nable crime of funding and providing for a part
of the public debt, which was as due
as any other part of itâand this is called en-
CTcafing the debtl It is the most fortunate thing
for the enemies of the government, that Con
grcfh have considered the publicJaUk as sacred
and as binding as private faith âhad a different
line of conduct been adopted, our pre'ent de
claimers, to have been confident, inuft have
been silent.
What a clamor rung thro' the continent during
the firft > ear ol the new government, because COll
- delayed funding the debtâbecause they did
not provide for the defencelefs frontiersâdid not
protest trade and, manufa&uresâwith a score of
other complaints. All these things have been at
tended to, and the laws fecm to operate as well as
was expected. But the peal is now rung against
those a6ts. The government would get nothing
by turning Quaker, for one cheek is smit
ten, these angiy men stand ready to finite the other
also.
At a Meeting of ftindry Inhabitants of theWeftern
Counties of Pennsylvania, held at Pittsburgh,
August 22, 1792,
The following report of a Committee was unani-
inoufly adopted, viz.â
Strongly impressed with a sense of the fa
tal consequences thac mull attend an Excise, con
vinced that a tax upon liquors which are the com
mon dtink of a nation operates in proportion to
the number and not to the wealth of the people,
and of course is unjust in itfelf, and oppreflive up
on the poor : taught by the experience of other
countries that internal taxes upon consumption*
from their very nature, never can effe&ually be
carried into operation, without veiling the offi
cers appointed to collett them with powers mod
dangerous to the civil rights of freemen, and must
in the end deflroy the liberties of every country
in which they are introduced; feeling that the
late Excise Law of Congress, from the present
circuwilUnces of our agriculture, our want of mar
kets, and the scarcity of a circulating medium,
will bring immediate distress and ruin on the
Western Country. We think it olir duty to per
sist in our remonflrances to Congress, and in every
j other legal measure that may obftruft the operati
|on of the law, until we are able to obtain its total
repeal.
Therefore, Resolved, Tliat David Bradford,
James Msi fhal, Albert Gallatin, Peter Lisle, and
David Philips, he appointed for the purpose of
drawing a remonstrance to Congress ilatng our
ohj< ftions against the law that imposes a duty up
on spirituous liquors distilled within the United
States, and praying for a repeal of the lame, and
that the Chairman of the meeting be directed to
sign the fame in the name of the meeting, and to
take proper meafuies to have it prefentcd to Con
gress at their next fcflions.
RefoJvcd, That in order that our measures mav
be carried on with regularity and concert, that
Wm, Wallace, [here follow 20 other names] bejc
fpesivelyappointed committeesof correspondence
for the counties of Washington, Fayette and Al
