DEBATS ON THE REPRESENTATION BILL.
{ The Senate had amended the bill by encreafing the ratio jrom 30,000,
to 33,000 ; the House had djagreed to this amendment ; the Senate vo
ted to adhere. It was moved in the House this day y that they Jhould re
cede Jrom their disagreement.]
MR. AMES laid, the amendment proposed by the Senate,
though a iingle propofnion,, involves two qucitions, which
it wnl be proper, on this occalion, to discuss dillinctly.
Is ihe bill wrong, as the House pal Ted it ? and is the proposed
amendment of the Senate fit and proper ?
The original bill gives the latio of one member to 30,000 per
sons, and proceeds to stare the number of Representatives which
the refpe6tive Slates fhail have in the next Congiefs. If in this
dillribution of members, it shall appear that we have not pur
sued tnconfliiution, the bill is a bad one, and it is our duly to
concur with the Senate, at leafl in finking out the exceptionable
part.
Tne conflitution dircfts that Representatives shall he appor
tioned among the fcvcral States according to their refpctfive num
bers. The tt n >fe number of Reprefeniativcs being firlt fixed,
they fh ' apportioned to any Siate accoiding to its census.
Then; I tinee will shew what part of the reprelentation any
State I.: The wisdom and caution of the conftuutioo
have - - tie to Congress in this affair. Though Congress
is to 1 the members, ihe rule of apportionment is fixed ;
thenumb.ro: Rc puft ntatives will be 112. Tnele are to be ap
portioned to < . cii > ate according to its numbers. What part of
she 112 membeis will Virginia have according to its people?
The answer is e<ifily lound. Virginia, having 630,000 persons,
(which is her federal number, after deducting two filths for the
fbves according to the constitution) is entitled to 19 members?
The bill gives her 21. Isthat nglK ? Who will (ay tnat the words,
or meaning of the conflitution are puriued ? Are the Re prefenta
tives,then, apportioned or dilpioporttoned ?
We may believe the 1 1 lull ol figures. The sum is short and easy I
to reckon. Let us not then p<rlill in a measure which palpably
violates the constitution. Tne aiguinent might flop heieâbut,
to shew how other States will be wrong d by the bill, it may be
well topioceed. If the conllitution had been silent, as we are
men, common lenfe would have told us, and as we aie freemen,
we Ihould nave Icai ned from our habits of actingâthat an une
qual reprefentaiion is wrong. But the conflitution is not filcut,
ansi yet the bill gives Virginia 21 members.
The States of Vermont, Hew-Hamplhir , Rhode-Island, Con
necticut, New-Jcrlev and Delawate. have 766,428 persons, and
they will have by the bill only 21 membeis. With upwards of
one hundred and thirty thouland per'ous more than Virginia,
they will have no more members ihan that fingie State.
"1 hus Virginia has by ihe bill iwo members more than her due
number compared with the who e union, and not less than four as
u relpp&s the lix States before mentioned.
From this view of the operation of ihe bill, I draw this con
clufion,which I presume is anticipated,that the proposed diihibu
tion ol representatives is neither just and iqual 111 ufelf, nor war
ranted by the conllitution.
If lurther evidence of this injustice should be demanded, it can
be turnifhed. Rcpreltntaiives and direÂ£t taxes are to be appor
tioned by the fame ruleâand there is a manifeit propriety 111 the
ruleâin the dillribution of benefits and burden?-, the conflitution
has wilely excluded this means and temptation to partially.
It is an additional fecunty to our property that those who hold
the power are made to feel it when they exercile it ; and that ex
actly in the d egree that ihey hold it ; taxes are to be apportioned
according to the numbers in the refpeÂ£tivc States. It would not
be alio wed by the conflitution to use one rule lor apportioning
taxes and anothei for tne members. If two things are to be com
pared with a third and made equal to it, it follows that they mult
be equal 10 each other. Let us suppose ihis bill to have become a
law; and for the more piainly fhewmg its tendency, let us sup
pose Virginia to have 630,000 persons, her true number, and 21
members, and the 13 States to have, as Delaware actually has,
59.000 persons each, and one member to each Stateâin the whole
1 <397> 000 P â¬| fens. Let us suppose a tax to be laid equal to a dol
lar tor each perlon in the 14 States, that is, a tax ol 1,397.000 dol
lars. V irgmia, in point ol justice, and by ihe couftilutton, should
pay only according to her numbers, or 630,000 dollars ; yet Ihe
would pay 21 parts in 34, or 1,007,000 collars, being 377 000
more than her proportion. Whether with 21 members in 34 this
wrong would be imposed or submitted to } is not my qucltion.
1 his maybe called an exti erne cafe ; yet in fact Delaware, New-
Jerley, Connecticut,New-Hampfhire and Vermont, on a tax equal
10 a dollar a head, would avoid more than 150,000 dollars of
their just proportion ; the justice and the conflitutionality of luch
an apportionment of taxes aie upon an qual looting.
Lztraoidinary as this flattment may teem, it is not easy to shew
an authoiity in Congreis to apportion a tax 011 any other princi
ple. It would not do to deprive a State of its pioporlion of
mein ers, and yet to laddie it with taxes, according to numbers :
I he departure from the rule ol the conflitution in the cafe of re
prefeniativcs would be rendered both more flagrant and more
ga by an adheiente to it in the imposition of texes. Such a
comment upon thi* law would filcnce its advocates, such an ex
ecution of it would disfranehife the fufferers.
But this is not the country, and I trust this is not the govern
ment to do a violence ol this foriâ therefore no tax would be Lid
and yet, unless a new census should be taken, or a new law, at
lea It, tor apportioning icpreieniai ives should be pa (Ted, Congress

tution and our primal y civil rights violated, we have liitened to
hear regions which would shew fomc refpeft tor the one and the
other. It is needless to decide v hether men's pafTions will be
soothed or their under Handings convinced by an argument of this
kindâthat as the small States are equally with the large ones re
presented in the Senate, the advantage which the bill will secure
to Virginia in the iepiefentative branch is fit and proper, and
that ii was To intended by the Conftilution. Is one inequality if
it reallf exilted to hp balanced by another ? Because the confu
tation has secured to cach S:ate an equal vote in the Senate, are we
at liberty to make a new confutation as often as wÂ£ make a re
presentation law, to counterpoise it ; and under a form of govern
ment contrived to feeure equal liberty, and to fix right above
opinion are the measure and the nature of this retribution to
the great vStates to depend on our arbitrary difcietion ? This an
fwei is perhaps moie feiious than the argument. Let it be re
futed by itfelt.
Because the great States fuffcr wrong in the constitutional com
patl, w ill this bill do them right? Is Maflachuletts or North-
Carolina benefited by giving Virginia two extra members? B/
this bill the great States are injured as well as the small ones. The
lmall ones are injured as it refpeÂ£U each other. Delaware will
have one member, Rhode-Island twoâyet the latter has only
nine thousand more people than the former. But the doflrine
tears up the foundation otcompa&on which we Hand, and under
the appearance of vindicating the bill from a charge oi violating
the conftituiion, establishes a claim to violate it at pleasure.
It has been (aid that th<r representatives are to be apportioned
among the several Statesâthat Congress is not to regard the num
ber of the whole nation ; It is not easy to fee how the hill can be
defended on any principle of diflribution among the States. The
representatives are to be apportioned according to numbers. The
number of members allotted to a State mult correspond either
with the number of persons in any other Stale, or the number 111
all the States ; compare Virginia with either of the fix States be
forementioned, or with the whole fix ; it appears that 130,000
persons in the latter will go unrepresented ; compare Viiginia
with the nation, she has two members more than her proportion.
Why then is it so zealously contended, that the apportionment is
not to be made upon the entire number of the union, but upon
the census of each State ? The bill is as naked of defence on the
one companfon as the other. Jt departs as widely from the
principles of its advocates as from those of its adversaries.
It is indeed intimated that you are to take the ratio of 30,000,
and to apply it to each State, without regarding its operation.
To juftify this interpretation, the text of the confiitution ought to
read, each State shall have as many members as the ratio of 30.000 ap-
number of per Jons wit! give it ; But that lnltrument is ve
ry differently cxpiefled,and much better ; repref ntatives and diretl
taxes are to be apportioned among the several States according to their
refpetlive numbersâwill any gentleman who votes for the bill lay
that it is luch an apportionment P Will it accoid with theConfti
tuiion to take, inlicad of such an apportionment, an arbitrary ra
tio, which, instead of apportioning, disproportions riprefenta*
tives to numbers ? The ratio mentioned in the Conftitiiiion, and
in the proposed amendment to it, evidently relates to the whole
number of representatives which according to it may be had from
the whole nation, and not from the number of people in a State ;
any other fenle besides being unnatural, would difagrce with the
clause which diretfs how representatives shall be apportioned.
By the 1 alio of one to 30,000 may be known the greatest num
ber of reprelentatives which shall form this branch ot the govern
ment. Having deteimined the number it remains to apportion
the members according to the census in the refpe&ive States. No
thing is more natural cr torrefponds more pei tecliy with the con
llitution than to find firft the whole number of representatives,
and then to apportion them as ttie constitution diredts. But this
method would not suit the present emergency ; for that would
give Virginia 19 members and no more. Instead of beginning
with ihe whole number, the bill lays, let us begin at the other
end ; give Virginia her 21 firft, and, if the number should hold
out, give to all the States at that rate. It ieems on trial the num
ber will not hold out to apportion in that manner, fttl!, however,
fays the bill, give Virginia her 21.
Let theconftitution become what the bill makes it, a dead let
ter. Still however, men, and freemen, will remain, who wil
prcferve the departed 4pirit ; for before the constitution was form
ed our rights were equal; and can it be believed that compafcl
has made them less ; Men equal in rights allented to a government
which prclervcs them equal in power : 30,000 citizens reliding
where they may, must pollefs civil rights and powers equal to
30,000 in any other part ol the union; yet though a compatfc
which ought to be inviolable, has ordained that rcprefentation,
>hat is to lay, power, shall be apportioned according to numbers,
this bill coniraditbng the language of naiurt and compact, dtre&s,
that 30,000 in Virginia shall have as much power as near 60,000
in Dciawaieand levcial other States.
It would ill suit the seriousness ot my present emotions to fay
how little the luppolcd expediency ot a numerous alfembly and
many other favorue topics have to do with the debate ; Contti-
JUtional questions are so frequent they have almofl loft then pow
er to impress us. But this touches the firft organization of the
-ody politic ; it goes to ftifle liberty 111 her cradle âit establishes
the power of a part over the wholeâit is a distranchifement of
some of the States. 11 the rights of Virginia were invaded, I
riift I should be equally zealous to maintain them. For the com
mon right is the common fecunty; but this bill tears the title
deed in pieces.
Having compaied the bill with the conftitution,and seen the re
fu!t of the comparison, it remains to enquire what amendment
w:ll be proper and constitutional. In this part of the enquiry, I
will not pretend to fay that I have ariivtd at equal certainty. I
h.uc no doubt that the bill is bad, but I am not equally fatisfied
of the best mode of amending it,
To determine what is right, some principle must be ascertained,
That firft pi inciple is equality ; it is another name for justice :â
Thai which is the right of the people:, therefore, is the duiy of thv
government. But as it is noi pradlicable to apportion representa
tives exa6flv among the several Hates accord ng to their numbers,
it is our duty 10 approach as nearly to that equality as may be. If
an apportionment is proposed, and it can be shewn that a more
equal one can be made, it becomes our duty so to make it. For if
we have an arbu ai y discretion to reject the mod equal apportion
ment , and to adopt a less equal, what is to rcftrain us from chufing
(he lead equal of all, that is to fay, having no apportionment at all.
If this principle is not to govern us, then we are to a& without
ony rule at all, and the constitution was made in vain. We cannot
have more representatives than one to 30,000 âbut in apportioning
them, let us follow the constitution, and do it according to num
bersâand when we Hop, as we mull, (h&rt of a perfect equality,
285
fslop o
[Whole No. 280.]
it will be the conflitution that restrains us. In doing this, we
ihall aflunie no arbitrary controul over the equal and sacred rights
ot the people. We {hall have done all that we can to give them
energy. 11 has appeared on difcuflion that the rule of 30,000, pro
posed by the bill, is so iar from being the most equal,that no more
capricious and unjust difpropoitionrnent of representatives has
yet been suggested. The ratio of 33,000, tho' not free from ex
ception is less unequal, and leaves less unrepresented tractions.
The amendment (Mr. Benson's) which was proposed to the
amendment of the Senate, would increase the representatives to
119. Two objections have been made to this increaseâit has been
called a representation ot fra6tionsâand a number of changes were
rung upon the idea. It has also been said to be as dispropor
tionate a representation as that given by the bill.
As to the- fir ft objection, it is a mere play upon the word frac-
tionsâfor if the effett be as it will appear to be, to pioduce a
more equal representation, it may be retorted that the bill gives a
rcprefentation by fractionsâwhereas the other mode makes 119
whole paits, nearly equal to each other, and gives a member 10
each.
This brings me to the next obje&ion, and which has been stre
nuously urged against having the amendment of 119 members f
that it will be as unequal as the bill.âThen I shall think as un
favorably of itâwe should not hesitate to renounce them both.
But figures will shew with certainty whether it is true that the
amend ment which proposes to add one member to (even of the
States will operate as uncquallv as the bill. To refute this I have
made a table in which are leen the effeÂ£ls of the two plans which
are to be compared.
Mr. Ames then read the following ftitement :
RATIO OF REPRESENTATION.
The amendment proposed in the Houle to the amendment of
the Senate, will make an addition of one meinbei to each of the
following seven States.
In the third column of figures is the ratio according to which
each State will be represented in cafe the bill should pals as it flood
when it. was sent to the Senate.

He then remarked, that if the ratio of 30,000 deserved so much
refpett as gentlemen had declared was due to it, because the
amendment of the conflituuon has adopted it, they cannot for
bear to fay that the bill in every inftancc, except four Stales, de
parts from that ratio ; whereas the plan he was comparing with
the bill has made it the common measure and applied it with less
variation than perhaps any other scheme will permit.
It appears from the foregoing ftatemeut, that the latio of thirty
thousand is applied with more equality, in put fu a nee ot the amen J
meut, than by the billâFor 50 members will be chosen by fix of
the seven States to which one member is propoled to be added,
and the ratio of 30,000 will be nearly observed.
The short numbers, in the cafe of 5 members, will be 1635 â
of three members, 1489 âof twelve, 540.
The deficiency oi numbers tor chuhtig 16, will be less than 300,
and for 14, less than 200.
The deficiency for the choice of the* two Delaware members,
will be greater âbut that will be only 2231.
Add to this, 55 membets will be cholen by New-York, Penn
fyWania, Maryland and Virginia, at the rate of one to 30,000.
So that 107 members will in effect be chosen by ihe ratio of
one to 30,000.
By the bill, fomc States, efprcially the seven to which additions
are proposed, will lose numbers. In ihe plan of the amendment,
they will gain âby comparing their loss, in one cafe, with the
gain in the other, the degree of equality can be exa&ly comput-

He said that if by this plan the seven States to which a member
was added gainers, that is to fay, would be allowed mem
bers for a less number than 30,000, the gain was very little. In sac
the Slates would be reprefemed very nearly according to the f >
scale ; the bili on the contrary makes the feale, or ratio, vary
from 55,000 to 30,000.
But if tfie advantage to the seven States, or the number lefÂ«
than 30,000 for one member is compared with the or ine
quality, luftained by the bill, it is found to be as 30,861 gain, by
adding seven members, to 178,171 loss, by th-e unreprefeiued trac
tions'âas the bill ftartds.

30851Mr. Ames made a number of remarks to elucidate the state
ments and to fiiew the unequal operation of the bill, and the
fairnefs of the other plan,
After which he proceeded to shew that the States of Kentucky,
Georgia, and Rhode-Iflaud would have the mod cause to com
plain of tra&ionsor unprefented numbers* But he laid the frac
tions of those three States amounted to the fraÂ£tional number of
one only of the seven States to which a member would be added.
If no nearer approach could be made towards an exa&ly equal
proportion, no just objection could be urged against the plan on
the part of Rhode-Island, Georgia, or Kentucky ; tor thev would
fee the cafe could not be remedied. He then urged the equal
operation of the plan bet ween States having equal numbers, and
contrasted the bill and the amendment which had been proposed
in the House.
From aggregate loss and gain on the two modes of apportion
ment in the foregoing flatements, fee the comparison more parti
cularly between particular States, viz.
Virginia has 21 members. The loss, that is, the excess of her
numbers over 30,000, is 54"
Massachusetts has 15 )

On the other hand, the gain on 21 members, or numbers short

mont, the numbers gained will be $
Balance against the bill is
The question isâwill the amendment* adding one member to
Massachusetts, and one to New-Hampshire, cure the error ?â
The answer appears by tbe statement, that Virginia will be as
fully represented, according to numbers, as those two states, saving
a difference of 13389, or within two-fifths of a member. In 42
members, that fra&ional inequality is scarcely an error.
In like manner, by adding a member to North-Carolina, the
error or inequality compared with New-York, is equal to a fourth
part the number for one memberâwhereas, by the bill, Malla
chufetts and New-Hampshire will lose almost two members, and
Virginia will gain two ; a difference little short of four members.
Mr. Dayton said that if the vote which was a
bout to be taken, were merely to determine what
should be the ratio of representation, he should
have been contented, he said, to have remained
in his feat, and to have given a ftlent vote upon
the occasion ; but to him it appeared to involve
in it a question and a principle of infinitely high
er moment. Â«
Two of the members from Virginia, Mr. Day
ton observed, had candidly admitted the inequa
lities complained of in the apportionment pre
lcribed by the bill sent up to the Senate, and had
acknowledged the advantages to be given to their
llate over every other : they did not, he faid,con
tradict the calculations, nor combat the argu
ments which had been offered again ft it, but they
boldly claimed and exatfed those advantages as
a right. This being the cafe, the question was
in reality no longer, whether 30 or 33000 ihould
be the rule of apportionment, but whether the
Jegiflature of the Union were in future to frame
their a<Ss with a view to the particular and all
moft exclusive advantage of Virginia, and to bend
and accommodate their laws to the interests and
will of the people or representatives of that (late.
It was now also to be determined, Mr. Dayton
further obferveil,whether Pennlylvania was here
after destined to hold in her hands, as ihe had
been in some measure used to do, the political
balance of the states, to be the umpire in our
disputes, and the centre ofourunion.âJudging,
he laid, from the votes upon record relating to
this business, and from some other circnmftances,
she was no longer intended or qualified to hold
that important station. The ancient prophecy,
he said, seemed to be verifying among a people
for whom he had never considered it as intend
ed. The saviour of this country, the political
Shiloh, was now among us,and universally known
and acknowledged, and the sceptre was about
to depart from Judah. Tbefe, he added, were
the well known preparatives to the summons
which was soon to follow for their adembling at
the New-Jertifalem. He concluded with faying,
that not I'ennfylvania alone, but far the greateit
part of the union would have reason to repent
the determination againll: the amendment of
the Senate, and of adherence to the original bill.
He, for his own part, believed that such a deter
mination not only struck at the existence of the
state sovereignties, but reached to the very vitals
of the general government, and that it must e
â ventually produce either a general consolidation
of the union into one national mass, or an abfo-
Kits separation of its members.
Mr. Venable supposed that a Virginian was
poflefled of equal rights with other men ; if this
lie a government of compaift, he has equal rights
with other men ; but is it a reason, that because
Virginia has relinquiflied a part of her rights
â¢when this compact was forming, that (he fliouid
not now hold what she has not resigned ? The
dispute on the ratio ot'reprefentation does not
affedt Virginia ; for whatever ratio may be a
dopted, her representation mud always be com
plete : whether this be a confblidated or federal
government, Virginia will have her full propor
tion in every cafe except one, that is, in cafe she
should be reduced to a less number than onemem
ber ; so that, upon whatever grounds we take
it, whether fractional or condittitional, the re
sult will be nearly the fame. Calculations there
fore are out of the question, and after all thear
guinents of northern and southern intereds, of
the differences between (mall Hates and large
dates, the companion is brought to Virginia and
Delaware, and the queltion to drike off seven
members from the five large dates, and add tp
the seven final'.er onesâThus is one-fixteonth of
the whole representation of the union to be dc
duifted unconditionally from one part, & given
away to another, which has already more than a
jud proportion in the government : for although
it is contended that we fhonld not argue from
the proportion the small states bear in the Senate,
yet I hold it fair, in speaking of a government
of representation, to take the whole into view,
and not to be governed by such partial compari
sons. Under this consideration I fay, that every
man inVirginia,as represented in the two branch
es of the legislature, is to a man in Delaware on
ly as one to eleven and one half, And in the electi
on of a President only as one to sne and an half.
This is an advantage enjoyed by individuals in
the smaller dates more than by those in the larg
er, and this advantage would be dill increafet! by
I an adoption of the amendment of the Senate :
Is it therefore just toincreafe this inequality ? Is
it fair that a man living in the neighbourhood
ofanother, with only the boundary line ofadate
between tliein, should be represented only in the
proportion of one to eleven and an half ? I contend
that the principle which comes the nearest to
hold out equal rights to every man, is the mod
proper one, and one that I will always contend
for as a citizen of the United States, and as a ci
tizen of Virginia. I shall never wish to encroach
upon the conditution, but I will be equally a
gaind dedroying the balance between the rights
which the people have delegated, and those they
have retained.

Take the fubjeft in any point of view, the five
large itates will fend, suppose 81 members, to
the House of Representatives, and 10 to the Se
nate, whilst the nine smaller ftatcs will have 31
members in this house, and 18 in the Senate ;
so that the majority of the representation in the
one is overpowered in "the other, and taking
the whole aggregate of the inhabitants of
the United States, if divided into the majority
contained in those five large states, and the mi
nority in the nine smaller ones, it appears that
the minority of the people candidate to the ma
jority in elections, &c. &c.

A second proportion offered by the fame gentlemen, to author

NEW CITY Of WASHINGTON
The following description is annexed to the plan of the
City oj IV afhingtcn, in the dijlrtft of Columbia, as
sent to Congress by the President fotue days ago.
Plan-os the City intended for the permanent feat
of the Government of the) United States, pro
je<fied agreeably to the direction of the Presi
dent of the United Slates, in pursuance of an
A(ft of Congrel's, pafled on the 16th of July,
1790, " establishing the permanent feat 011 the
banks ofthe Poto\viÂ«ack"--By Peter Charles
L'ENKA NT.
Observations explanatory of ths plan
I. v 8 HE positions for the different grand edi-
X sices, and for the leveral grand squares
or areas of different (hapes as they are laiddown,
were firft determined on the most advantageous
ground, commanding the most extensive prof
pedts, and the better fufceptibl'e of such improve
ments as the various interests of the several ob
jects may require.
11. Lines or avenues of diredl communication
have been devised to connect the separate and
most distant objetfts with the principals, and to
preserve through the whole a reciprocity of fight
at the fame time. Attention has been paid to
t lie palling of t hole leading avenues over the molt
favorable ground for profnedt and convenience.

/Jiution as the city into fqmrei, &c. and
those lines have been so combined as to meet at
certain given points with those divergent ave
luies, so as to form ontliefpaces " fn ft determin
ed," the different squares, or areas, which are
all proportional in magnitude to the number of
avenues leading to then).
BREADTH OF THE STREETS
Every grand transverse avenue, and every
principal divergent one, such as the communica
tion from the Prefldent's House to the Congress
House, &c. are l'6o feet in breadth, and tlins di
vided
10 feet for pavement on each fide is
go of gravel walk, planted with trees
on each fide,
So in the middle for carriage way,
The other streets are of the following dimen
flons, viz.
Those leading to the public buildings
or markets,

Others,
In order to execute the above plan, Mr. Elli
cott drew a true meridian line by celestial obser
vation, which pasTes through the area intended
for the Congress-House ; this line he crofled by
another due enft and weft, and which pafles
through the fame area. Tliefe lines were accu
rately meafored, and made the basis on which
the whole plan was executed. He ran all the
lines by a transit inftrnment, and determined the
acute angles by a&ual measurement, and left no
thing to the uncertainty of the compass.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
[Conclusion of a speculation began in theift pa s e of our last paper.]
SHOULD we have reason to regret our relapse
into errors, which we have heretofore deter
mined with ourselves to correct, and hoped to
subdueâlet us carefully examine whether we
have not chosen a wrong method to effedi such
refolutionsâihe passions of men, as well as their
reason, are the gift of nature, and intended to
make complete the moral character of man : it
is our natural access to vice, which enhances the
charms of virtue ; and " he that conquers hiin
felf is the greatest of conquerors"âand in no si
tuation do we derive equal fatisfatfion to our
ielves, or appear with greater advantage to those
around us, as after a fair competition with our
passions, vre can boast the ascendancy of reason
but our failure in acquiring this supremacy, is
oftener to be attributed to a want of ikill in con
ducing the conflict, than from real depravityâ
as when under the conviction of error we feel
an ingenious wish of amendment ; we are apt to
forget the strength and intimate connexion of
our natural propensities, still confirmed by habit,
and by too sudden an attack on anyone of them'
we give the alarm to the reft and rouse the whole
phalanx of our passions to resistance, which are
found too strong for the feeble barrier of reason
and collefling power from success, impose a hea
vier bondage whereas, if we would endeavor
their gradual and adroit fubjugarion, calling in
occasionally by reflexion the pieafure we deriv
ed from one conquest to our aid in the pursuit of
anotherâwe should soon find reason smiling in
the feat of empire, and by her rays be led to the

Old and New Testaments of his Royal Quarto Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE. The Apocrypha and Index, &c. will be finith

Such Gentlemen as hold Subscription Paters, he begs will
return them to him at Worcejler, or to him and Company at Boflen,
by the last day of November next, and as much sooner as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work has been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highest approbation; both as to the execution of the;
printing, its correftnefs, and its cheapnels compared with Englilh
copies of the fame size and quality.
As this verv laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking
is carried 011 solely at his own cost, he is led to hope that all those
who wish to polTefs a large Family Bible, will so far encourage this
laudable undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
to the fubfeription.
