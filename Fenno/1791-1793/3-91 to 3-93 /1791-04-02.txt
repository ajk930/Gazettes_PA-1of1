THK Queen-Mother had either lriore liypo
crify, or more foftnefs of temper or more
cunning. She was for eilaying all means of al
luring the Chiefs of tlie Hugonots to the bosom
of the Church, and their obedience to the King.
The differences of circnmftances, of manners,
of interelts and charaifters, as usual, divided
their sentiments, and, cauting them to look at
things on different lides, dilated opposite reso
lutions. The two Kings however take measures
in concert to suppress rebellions. The Queen
Â«f Navarre comes to court. The King engages
the family ot the Chatillons to a reconciliation
with that of the Guises. Their reciprocal hatreds
i'oon rekindle and breakout afrefli. The Queen
of Navarre in discontent quits the court.
The advice of tlie Duke of Alva was conform
able to the temper and character of this King.
He said he highly relilhed the sentiment of the
Duke of Alva ; that; the heads of thole rebels
were too high in the State. The four families
of Bourbon, Montmorency, Guile and Chatillon,
all stimulated by other subordinate families de
pendent on them, continue their emulations,
fallacies, hatreds, envies, oppositions, intrigues,
manoeuvres, combinations, decomposition'S, ter
giversations : Another civil war breaks out, the
history of which with its causes and events, we
ilfa.ll leave the reader to read in detail. In 1567,
at the battle of Saint Dennis, the Constable de
Montmorency, in fpight of five wounds he had
received in the head and face, fought with ex
treme valour, endeavors to rally his troops,
and lead them 011 to battle, when Robert Stuart
a Scot, came up to him and presenting to him a
pistol, the Constable said to him, " yon are ig
norant then that lam the Constable." "It is
because I know you, said Stuart, that I present
yon this," and at the fame time fliot him in the
ihoulder with his own pistol ; although the vio
lence of the blow (truck down the Constable, he
had still strength enough left to strike Stuart in
the face with the hilt of his sword, which re
mained in his hand, though the blade was bro
ken, wiih such force as broke his jaw, beat out
three of his teeth and brought him down by his
fide half dead. The Hugonots were defeated
however, but the next day the Constable died
at the age of fourfcore, after having shown in
the action as much enterprize, bravery and vigor
as if he had been in the full strength of his youth.
He preserved to his last moment, an admirable
firtnnefs and presence of mind ; a priest ap
proached his bed, to prepare him for death ; the
Constable turned so him with a serene counte
nance, and prayed to be left in reposeâadding
it would befhameful for him to have lived eighty
years, without learning to die for half an hour.
ITis wifdoin, his rare prudence, and long experi
ence in affairs procured for him and his family
immense riches, and the firft em ploy nients under
the crown : But he was always so unfortunate
in the command of armies, that in all the enter
piizes where he had the command in thief, he
was either beaten, or wounded or made prisoner.
I he Calvimftic army retired into Champaine,
and afterwards into Lorrain to meet the troops
they expecfted from Germany. The Queen, whom
the death of the Constable had now delivered
from the power and ambition of the Grandees
and who remained the single arbiter of the Ca
tholic party, would 110 longer expose herfelf to
the dangers of an unlimited power by advifmtr
the King to name another Constable or General'
of the army. She judged more proper to re-
Cerve to the disposition of the King and in her
own power, the whole authority of the command.
She therefore persuaded Charles, by many rea
sons, to place at the head of his army, the Duke
of Aujou his brother, a young I rince of great
hopes, but who was nor yet sixteen years ofa-re.
1 he army is reinforced byfuccouis Cent from
? landers by the King ofSpain, and from Piedmont
and many other places. The Duke of Anjou
follows the Hugonots, to give them battle before
their junction with the Germans. He overtakes
them near Chalons: But the misunderstandings
and other obltacles excited in his council, hinder
him from hazarding a battle. The Calvinifts
pais the Meufe and form a junction with the aux
iliary troops commanded by the Prince Caffimir.

to draw one the war, ii,to length ; marches off
the two armies, Satisfied with observing each
other's motions. This Fabian fyitem of the Ca
tholics disconcerts the Prince of Conde and the
Admiral, unprovided with money to support, for
any length of time, their army. In order to draw
the royal army to battle they form the siege of
Thames. The danger of that city gives occa
sion to new propositions of peace : Indeed a peace
is concluded and the two armies are separated ;
but the Hugonots did not surrender all the pla
ces they were matters of, nor did the King dis
charge his Swiss or Ifallian troops âwhich occa

TOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FENNO,
A WRITER in your paper has expressed his
surprise that only in the state of Pennsylva
nia the law for eftablifliing the Bank of the Uni
ted States has been found fault with : It has yet
had hardly time to circulate in the others ;
and it is a measure of so much depth, and in its
confeqoeiices of fomuch greater magnitude than
appeais on the fuperficies, that it will require a
good deal of time for investigation, before its
merits can be justly appreciated. It did not
want however for respeCtable authorities opposed
to it at its birth, and it is believed their reason
ings are such as will bear the test of time.
Whether the opposition be numerous, or whether
the publications against it be those of a single indi
vidual, or of many, is of no importance to the
question â¢ If the reasonings ate right, and ground
ed on solid principles, they will carry their own
weight with themânor will theprogrefs of truth
be less certain because of its being flow or unat
tended.
If an attachment to the Bank of North-Ameri
ca, (now called it seems the Bank of this State,)
be a signal of opposition, then indeed the num
ber of opponents will be numerousâfor that heart
inuft be dead to all the finer feelings of human
nature, that can at once forget the eminent ser
vices rendered by this Bank, not to the State on
ly, but to the United Statesâwhofeprefervation
in a very critical moment may be greatly deduced
from it : This attachment is the natural charac
terillic of an enlightened American, who has
vvknefled the scenes of the late war, and thinks
it hard the Bank alone should fuffer, in a moment
when all other creditors for public services are
ac Jealt receiving two thirds of their dues.
The friends of the Bank of North-America are
also warm and zealous friends of the United
States ; they are among the moll ftedfaft fup
portersofits present excellent Conllitution of
government âthey have no diffidence in the a
bundant resources of their country they contri
bute largely to its Imports, and have all'the zeal
any other citizens can have for the due support
of its power ; but they fee 110 reason for all this,
to relinquiili the solemn chartered rights thcvare
poflefled of, or to yield to any other Bank the
high privilege offerving their country, for which
they were so early and so fuccefsful candidates.
The people of Pennsylvania are too enlightened
to embark all in one bottom, or not to cherish
that power most, which is exclusively their own :
By being strong, the State is the more refpecfta
ble, and (he can riot be independent but by hav
ing her monied resources at her own command.
The public creditors are fafe in reposing 011
the faith of the Union for their payments : To
these no Bank is eflential, while the country has
justice to do what is right, and power to collecl
the necefl'iry funds : How far their interests are
concerned in the propofcd Bank can be easily
lievvn them ; it may become the grave of their
certificates, but can never give them more lifeJr
vigor than is implied in their present solid and
secure foundationâon the faith of the United States.
avarice
MR. Osterwald, a well known Banker, died
lately at Paris, literally of wantâ
â" A want, which many may think mad
" But numbers feci the want of what he had."
This man, originally of Neufchatel, felt the
violence of the disease of Avariceâ for surely it
is rather a disease than a pajfion of the mind, so
urongly, that within a few days of his death, no
importunities could induce him to buy a few
pounds of meat fÂ»r the purpose of making a lit

fliould not dislike the soup, but I have no appetite
(or the meatâwhat then is to become of that ?"
At the time that he refufed this nouriflnnent,for
fear of being obliged to give away two or three
pounds of meat, there was tied round his neck
a filkeu bag, which contained 800 Affignats of
1000 livres each. At his outset in life, he drank
a pintofbeer, which served him forfupper, every
night at a house much frequented, from which
he carried home all the bottle corks he could
come at. Of these, in the course of eight years,
he had collected as many as fold for twelve louis
d'ors, a sum that laid the foundation of his future
fortuneâthe fuperftru<flure of which was rapidly
raised by his uncommon fuccefsin stock-jobbing.
He died poffefled of three millions of livres,

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SATURDAY, Feb. 7.
Tb; BANK BTLL undc r confidiration.
MR. GILES,
IN thecourfeofdifcuffingthe present important
question, jr has been fevera] rimes iniinuateci
that local motives, and not a Candid and patrio
tic in veftigation of the fubjetft upon its merits,
have given rile to that difference of opinion,
which has been heretofore manifefted in this
house. I shall not examine the truth of this ob
servation, but merely remark, that the causes
which may have produced the arguments against
the proposed mealure, whatever they be, can
neither add to, or take from, their merit and in
fluenceâand of course the insinuations might
have been spared without injury to the fubjet'l ;
! but * ar as the observation may have been in
| tended to apply to myfelf, I can truly fay, that
j if a bias were to influence my conduct, it would
rather direct it to favor, than to oppose the pro
posed mealure : 1 his bias would arile from two
causesâthe one from the refpeft which I enter
tain for the judgments of the majority who ad
vocate the mealureâthe other of a more serious
nature : I have observed with regret a radical
difference of opinion between gentlemen from,
the ealtern and southern states, upon great go
vernmental questions, and have been led to con
clude, that the operation of that cause alone,
might call ominous conjecture on the promised
luccefs of this much valued government : Mutual
concefiiotis appear to be necessary to obviate this
effect ; and I have always been pleafcd in mani
felling my disposition to make advances ; but
from the mofl. careful view of the arguments in
favor of the proposed measure, considered under
this imprelfion, they do not seem to mefufficient
to efiablifh the propriety of its adoptionâand I
am therefore impelled by the joint influence of
duty and opinion to be one in the opposition.
A gentleman from Maflachufetts, (Mr. Ames,)
prefaced his observations with this remark, that
it is easier to point out defers and raise objec
tions to any proposed fyftetn, than to defend it
from objections and prove its affirmative propri
ety, and warned the house against the effeCts of
arguments of this nature, urged in opposition to
the measure now under confederation. 1 agree
with the gentleman in this idea in generr.l, but
we should reflect, that in the present cafe, the
addrefsof the arguments in favor of the measure
is made to one of the strongest affections in the
human mind, (the love ofdominion,) and hence
we may justly conclude, that they will be recei
ved and relished with their full and unabated in
fluenceâthis reflection appears to me to be at
least a counterpoise to that remark.
T he advocates ofthisbil] have been called on,
and I conceive with propriety, to fliew its consti
tutionality and expediency, both of which have
been doubted by those of the opposition. In sup
port of thefirft position a multitude of argument*
have been adduced, all of which may be reduci
ble to the following heads : Such as are drawn
from the cotiftitution itfelf : From the inciden
talityof this authority to the mere creation andfcxiftence of governmentâfrom the expediency
of the measure itfelfâand from precedents of
Congressâto which may be added, a similar ex
ercile of authority by Congress, under the for
mer confederation.
Obfervatior.s arising from the constitution it*
felf were of two kinds : The right of exercising
this authority is either exprelfed in the constitu
tion, or deducible from it by necetfary implica
tion. One gentleman only, from Maflachufetts
(Mr. Sedgwick) has ventured to aflert, that dis
carding the doctrine of implication, he could
show that the right to exercise the authority con
tended for, was expressly contained in the con-
Ititution ; this I presume mufl have been a mis
take in language, becaufethe difference between
an express, and an implied authority appears to
liie to consist in this ; in the one cafe the natural
import of the words used in granting the author
ity, would of themfelves,convey a compleat idea
to the mind, of the authority granted, without the
aid of argument or dedu&ion ; in the other, to
convey a compleat idea to the mind, the aid of
argument and deduc r tion, is found neceflary to
the usual import of the words used ; and that
gentleman proceeded with a laboured argument
to prove that the authority was expressly granted,
which would have been totally useless if his as
sertion had been just.
(Mr, Sedgwick rose to explainâhe never con
ceived the authority granted by the express words
of the constitution, but absolutely by necellary
implication from different parts of it.)
I lhall not contend as to the affertioii; but shall
proceed toconlider the arguments in favor of the
measure upon the dodrine of implicationâwhich
indeed are those only which deserve considera
tion.
]n doing this, Ifhall consider the authority con
tended for, to apply to that of granting charters
of incorporation in general ; for I do not recoi
led: any circumstance, and I believe none has
been pretended, which could vary this cafe from
the general exercise of that authority. To es
tablish the affirmative of this proposition, argu
ments have been drawn fromfeveral parts of the
constitutionâthe context has been resorted to.
[IVe, the people oj the United States, in order to jorm
a more perfect union, ejiablifh jujlice, injure domeflic
tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote
the general welfare, and secure the blefings of liberty
to ourselves and our pojlerity, ire.] It has been re
marked, that here the ends for which this govern
ment was created are clearly pointed outâthe
means to produce the ends are left to the choice of
the legislature, and that the incorporation of a
bank is oneneceflary mean to producethefe gene
ral ends. It may be observed in reply,that the con
text contemplates every general objeifl of go
vernment whatever; and if this reasoning were
to be conclusive, every objed of government
â would be within the authority of Congress, and
the detail of the constitution would have been
â wholly unneceflary farther than to defig.natethe
several branches of thegovernment, which were
to be intrusted with this unlimited, discretion
ary choice of means to produce these fpecified
ends : The fame reasoning would apply as forci
bly to every clause in the constitution, restrain
ing the authority of Congress as to the present
cafe, or to any other one in which the constitu
tion is silent. The only candid conftrudion ari
sing from the context appears to me to be this,
it is designed, and it is the known office of every
member to point out the great obje<fts proposed
to be answered by the subsequent regulations of
which the constitution is composed. These re
gulations contain the means by which these ob
jeds are presumed to be belt answered : These
means consist in a proper diftribuiion of all go
vernmental rights between the government of
the United States and the several state govern
ments, and in fixing limits to the exercise of all
authorities granted to the government of the
United States ; the context therefore gives no
authority whatever, but only contemplates the
ends for which certain authorities are subse
quently given. Argumentsdrawn from this source
appear to me to be ineffedual in themselves,
and the reliance of gentlemen upon them, indi
cates a suspicion and distrust of such as may be
drawn from other parts of the constitution.âThe
advocates of the bill have'turned away from this
context, and have applied to the body of the
conftitutioli in search of arguments : They have
fixed upon the following clauses, to all or some
one of which they alTert the authority contended
for is.clearly incidentalâthe right to lay and
coiled taxes, &c. &c.âto provide for the common
defenceandgeneral welfare, &c.âto borrow mo
ney, &c.âto regulate con>merce with foreign na
tions, &c, Thebill contemplates neither the lay
ing or colleding raxes, and of course it cannot
be included in that clause ; indeed it is not pre
tended by the bill itfelf, to be at all neceflaryto
produce either of those endsâthe fartheft the
idea is carried in the bill is, that it will tend to
give a facility to the ccllellion. The terms, (common
tlefence and general wrljare) contain no grant of
any fpecific authority, and car. relate to such on
ly as ,are particularly enumerated and lpecified.
7o borrow money,âgentlemen have relied much
upon tills clause, tlieir reasoning is, that a right
to incorporate a bank isincidental to that of bor
rowing money, because it creates the ability to
lend, which is necellary to effectuate the right
to borrow. lamat a loss to discover one single
relation between the right to borrow, and the right
to create the ability to tend, which is neceflary to
exilt between principal and incident: It appears
to me that the incidental authority is paramount
to the principal,for the right of creating the abi
lity to lend is greater than that of borrowing
from a previoully exilting ability ; I (hould there
fore rather conclude that the right to borrow, if
there be a connection at all, would be incidental
to the right, to grant charters of incorporation,
than the reverse of that proposition, which is
the doctrine contended for by the advocates of
the tneafure ; the fame reasoning which would
eftablilh a right to create the ability to lend,
gvould apply more strongly to enforce the will
after the ability be created, because the creator
would have a claim of gratitude at least upon the
created ability, which it withheld, perhaps with
justice might be infilled on. To regulate commerce
with foreign nations : This is by no means a fa
tisfacftory ground for the aflumption of this au
thority, for if it be deemed a commercial regula
tion, there is a clause in the constitution which
would absolutely inhibit its exercise : lallude to
that clause which provides that no preference
fball be given by any regulation of commerce or re
venue to the ports of one State over those of
another ; and it seems to be admitted that one
principal effect to be produced by the operation
of this measure, will be to give a decided com
mercial preference to this port over every other
in the United States.
Gentlemen finding it difficult to fliow that ne
ceflkry relation and intimate connexion between
the authority contended for, and any one of the
fpecified authorities before mentioned, which
would be essential to the eftablilhment of their
do<flrine,ha ve referred to what has been generally
called the fweepiug clause, and have made de
ductions from the terms necejfary and proper ;
they have observed, that certain fpecified au
thorities being granted, all others neceflary to
their execution follow without any particular
fpecification. This observation may in general
be true, but its fallacy here conflfls in its appli
cation to this particular cafe. It cannot be ap
pli ed until the exercise of this authority be pro
ved to be necessarily connected with some one of
the previously enumerated authoritiesâand here
the argument as well as the fadt fails : The au
thority contended for seems to me to be a dis
tinct substantive branch of legislation, and per
haps paramount to any one of the previouflv
enumerated authorities, and should therefore not
be usurped as an incidental subaltern authority.
I am confirmed in thisopiuion, from the indif
tindl confufed conceptions of gentlemen who ad
vocate themeafure ; they rely upon the incident
ally of this authority to some one of those par
ticularly fpecified, and yet have applied it as an
incident to several diftind, unconnected fubjecfts
of legislation ; and then diftruiting their own
conclulions, or as if the inquiry would be too
troublefoine or minute, they leave this ground,
and aflert that it is incidental to the result of the
whole combined fpecified authorities : Gentle
men mult therefore view this right through dif
ferent optics at different timesâor what I rather
believe to be the fad:, they have no diitinct view
of it at all, the right having no exiftenee.

Powderham-Caftlt, February
Yesterday evening a molt alarming accident
occurred at this venerable feat, which had very

was almost instantly inveloped in flames. Lord
Courtenay, who was happily in the room, with
wonderful presence of mind, threw his terrified
relative down, and instantly rolled the carpet
round her, and with the timely assistance of the
company, soon extinguilhed the flames. Miss
Courtenay is however dreadfully burnt in the
face, neck and arms. His Lordlhip's hands and
face are likewise much injured.

FRANCE
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, Jan. 27.
The King's JVLjfage to the Emperor of Germany.
A LETTER, bearing the name of Leopold, to
the King of France, on the fubjecfl of the claims
which the Princes and different members of the
German empire make to their pofl'effions in Al
sace, having been printed in the public papers
foine days ago, with many corruptions of the
text, the King sent a translation of the original
which is in latin, to the National AfTembly. This
communication was accompanied with a declara
tion from his Majesty, that he looked upon this
letter from Leopold, in no other light, than as an
official measure, as Emperor of Germany, and
that it was preceded and followed by the most
fatisfadlory afl'urance of pacific intentions. And
he takes the fame opportunity of profeffing that
such seems to be the dispositions of all the other
principal courts of Europe.
Immediately after the reading of this letter, a
decree pafled on the motion of the military com
mittee, for augmenting the fifty thousand fufees,
ordered by a decree of the 18th of December, to
be distributed among the National Guards, of the
kingdom to ninety-eight thousand. Of these
fufees, the officers of the departments, diftri&s,
and municipalities, are to be the guardians ; thÂ«
names of the citizens to whom they are entrusted,
are to be registered ; and, whoever is couvitSea
of felling his fufee, is to be rendered incapable
of bearing arms for three years.As Toon as thisdefenfive decree had pafled, M.
Mirabeau, and M. Alexander Lameth, produced
two plans of Decrees, the objeifl of which were,
torepref'ent the apparent dispositions of the pow
ers of Europe towards France, and the measures
to be taken for the fecuriry of the frontier,
To press the King to organize the army imme
diately, and fill up the regiments. For this lat
ter purpose, orders are given, that a hundred
thousand recruits fball be levied in the following
manner : The recruits which are to be levied in
the different departments of free citizens, are to
be enlisted for three years only, and to receive
three iols per day, under the condition of hold
ingthemfelves in readiness tojoin their regiments
when called upon, when they lhall receive the
fame pay as the regulars, and be furnifhed with
fifty livres for their equipment.
By this means the AUembly proposes, by a mo
derate expence, to provide for the defence of
the kingdom, in cafe of any attempts from a
neighbouring power, in conjunction with the in
numerable malcontents.
The King is also desired to com pleat the thir
ty regiments of infantry, and twenty regiments
ofhorfe, destined for the departments of the
Lower and Upper PÂ«.hine, the Ardennes, the High
Soan, Mount Jura, the Var, and the Higher and
Lower Alps.

His Excellency the Governor of this Commonwealth has ilTued
a PROCLAMATION, offering a reward of one thousand dollars
to any person or persons, who ihall apprehend and secure, so that
they may be brought to juflice, the men, or any of them, who
were guilty of murdering three men and one woman, belonging
to a party of friendly Indians, at a Block-House on the Weft fide
of Beaver Creek, in the county of Alleghany, the gth inft.
It is a Angular circumstance that none of the
oppofers of the Bank of the United States, either
in Congrefe or out of it, ever have attempted to
refute the arguments of the Secretary of the
Treasury in his report on which the system is
founded.
We are requested to contradict an account
published in some of the papers, of the Death of
General Gloverâthat gentleman being alive.
A letter from Fort-Pitt of 21 ft March, mentions
that the Indians have recently murdered sundry
persons within a Ihort distance ofthat place.
On Saturday the 26th inflr. was launched from
the {hip-yard of Mr. Ebenezer Young, New-York,
the Revenue Cutter Vigilant. '
The report of the death of M. D'Orleans by
the populace of Paris, appears to be a story from
the fame budget that produced the pretended
flight of M. de la Fayetteâand is therefore very
improbable.
