REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION,
(continued.)
A Sketch of the general Trade oj the United States.
r ~Â¥^llE coasting trade has become very great, and <
X the derangement cf the Welt-India trade
inuft extend it exceedingly, during the current
year, from the failure of molaifes. The increafi
ot mdimfa&ures, and foreign icitn&ions on oiher
branches, have contributed to elevate this valuable
part of our commerce; and the former fmanu
factures) will continue steadily to increase its im
portance. The vetfels which take supplies of
flour, and many other articles from the middle
and northern itates, to South-Carolina and Geor
gia, muke very frequent voyages, and they return
Icls than half laden ; but if the planters should
pursue the cultivation of hemp, flax, hops, and
cotton, they may come back with full cargoes.â
A similar lemark may be jultly made in regard to
other ftjtes.
The filherics do not appear to have recovered
their former value ; but it is plain they have in
creased yearly iince the year 1789 âand they are
even 1- w more valuable than they appear to be.
'1 he cisiiumpiion ol oil, whale-bonr, ikins of sea'
animals, spermaceti, and pickled and dried fifh,
is much greatÂ« r in the United Siat, s zt this time,
than it was twenty yeais ago. The out-fits of the
filhing vclfcls, too, are moie from the induilry and
relouiccs of the country than was formerly the
cafe. Wherefore the general benefits r< fulling
tiom the fifheries, are probably little less than be
loicthe levolution.
Remote as the United States are from all fo
reign nations,'totally unconnected with their poli
tics aDd having no temptation to wage war for
territoVy, they cannot but advance in commer
cial and agricultural prosperity, if they preserve
order and justice at home. Foreign reftri&ions
will be nectHarily leis rigid, as oeccfions for
luppliesand pacific ferviceslrom the United States
shall arise ; and these occasions mud inevitably
exist in every maritime nation, whichjihall engage
in war, even with a countiy which is not nfell
maritime.
The prosecution of manufa&ures has created
some increase of our foreign trade, and will ex
tend it. If we did not pursue ihat branch of in
dustry, wc (bould not import copper, iron, and
hemp, from the Baltic ; cotton, saltpetre and
White calliooes from India , ami cocoa, oye-wocus,
mahogany, cotton and hides from the Weft-In
dies and the southern part ot the American con
tinent. Some of these importations regular
ly and extensively made ; others are increafuig.
Without them wc should have no intercourse with
some of these countries, and much less than we
now have wth others. In like manner our 111-
tercourfe with fevcral countries is increased by
manufactured exports. The demand tor our pot
ash, distilled spirits, (hips and boats, feeel, malt
liquors, cheese, bar iron, flit iron, gunpowder,
carriages and other articles, occasions a greatei
and more bencficia! trade with many foieign ports.
It is impollible to lay how rapid and how confi
dsrablc the progress of this pait of our commerce
will be. The exported manufaflures of Great-
B.'itain in 1791, -were gieater than ihofc of fifty
years ago, by twice the value of our present ex-i
ports.
It is extremely favorable tj American com
merce, internal and foreign, that a variety of chan
ges have taken place in the affairs of the worjd,
which have opened branches of trade forincily
withheld from us bv monopoly, or other circum
stances. The ast ot separation from Great Bri
tain enabled us to trade to China, Bombay, and
Surat ; and the enterprise of our citizens soon dis
covered the way. The curious perfr&iou of ma
nufacturing machinery in Europe, has made it the
interest of the foreign India companies to fell us
I their piece goods in the markets ot the east, with
out taking them at fecoud hand. The misfor
tunes oi St. Domingo have encreafed our com
mercc in and will have the fame efieÂ£t
upon cotton, and they are driving us rapidly into
an internal trade in native spirits, which will of
course lead to external commerce of the fame
kind. This will appear to be a t matter of great
importance, when ii is remembered, that since the
hie peace, the foreign spirits imported have in
lime years been equal to one fifth of our (xports.
The failure of ship timber, which begins to ap
pear every where in Europe, is enublir.g the Un
ited States to carry on f.iip building upon very ad
vantagÂ«ous terms. The profitable establishment
of several banks of perfect credit with the mod
wary and judicious citizens ind foreigners, is at
once a proof and a great mean of commercial
prosperity. The growth of citics, towns,and ma
uufsftures has given to the fifheries a more sub
stantial basis in a conliderable home demand,!
than ihey foi merly had in a foreign one. The ba
nishment of paper tenders, and ex post facto laws,
ar.d the inteidithon oÂ» laws impairing the obliga
tions ol conttafts, have placcd cur commerce upon
a more honorable and solid footing, than it ever
was before. The mint, the laws regulating sea
men and the fifheries, the appreciation of the pub
lic debt, the {pint ol improvement on roads, ri
vers and canals, the difcovcry of coal near naviga
ble water, the late extension of the post office, the
constant incrcafe of light houses on the coasts, the
innod uftion of auxiliary arts, and above all, the
piogrefs ofjagriculture have given facility, stability
and extention to our tiade, which were unknown
before the revolution, and :n the riillrefsful
i derangements of 1786 ?nd i7B;appeared beyond
the bounds of realouablc expectation.

A FACT I ON, by which the kingdom of
France has for four years been torn asun
der, has jufk prevailed on his MoftChiiftian Maje
sty, to fa nation a Declaration of War against hia
Apostolical Majeftv, our mod honorable Lord and
nephew. The full a6ts of hofttlities seem to be
direÂ£ted against these Provinces ; and the enemies
of all order and power, who are meditating an
aggreflion so nnjuft, found their hopes ot success
lon the spirit of partv which was unfortunately
i diffeminatcd during the late troubles.
We will carefully attend to the defence of rhofs
provinces with the government of which we are
entruftcd, relying with confidence on the protec
tion of the Lord of Holts, who is pleased to mani
fest the effects of his omnipotence in favor of those
who are inl'pired with a sacred refpeÂ£t for the laws,
and for all powers by him ordained on the earth
for the government of human societies.
We flatter ourselves that everv class of citizens
will be animated with one spirit, and that they
will vigilantly attend to the maintainance of in
ternal tranquility and the prefcrvation of property,
while we order to the frontiers part of his Ma
jetty's troops, full of glory, and crowned by vic
toty under the two last reigns, until the league,
formed between several great powers, (hall oopofe
a mound to the torrent of Unifier pioje&s which
menaces the overthrow of Europe.
We owe it to the faithful fubje&s of his Ma
}efty, to inform them ot the meafires which we
have adopted, during a whole year, in hopes of re
maining at peace with France,; and to warn them
of the innumerable calamities which our enemies
are eager to spread and perpetuate, under the spe
cious veil of chimerical liberty, offered to a cre
dulous multitude, b} an impious feÂ£t of innova
tors, Jot difant philosophers, as the infallible re
sult ot their mad piojeits. 'i heir's is not to war
with the Ptinces of the earth, hut against the re
ligion of our ancestors, against tocial.order, againit
profperuy, and against ?!1 the comforts which n -
turally flow from it. 1 hey have already, by the
adoption of their absurd fyftcms, plunged their
country into all the horrors of anarchy. Jealous
of the prosperity of those nattorts who flill enjoy
the fruits of social order, they have formed for
their own protection the barbarous projett of in
spiring them with a similar delirium, of propaga
ting their errors, and with them all the calamities
| with which the kingdom of Fiance is at tins time
afflicted.
They have been, during a whole medita
ting and inventing pretexts for the aggreflion on
which they had icfolved. Having driven away
from the bosom of France, by dint of persecu
tions, al! those citizens who were attached to the
eftabliflied religion, and to the hi
therto held facrcd by the fundamental laws of
the kingdom, they have attempted to prevent
them from enjoying in any part of the world, the
fwects of holpitality which men reciprocally owe
to each othtr. We have been extremely caieft l
not to afford the flighted grounds of complaint,
' resolved not to meddle in the least degree, with
the political government of any neighbouring
states. We have taken care to prevent that any
thing fhouJd be attempted, or even written, in
those provinces, against the constitution just efta
bliftied in . ranee ; and as a reward for our ftri6fc
attention to the laws of good neighbourhood, a
horde of factious vagabonds has been assembled
ou our frontiers, resolved on the execution of the
most infernal plots. The mod infamous writings
against religion and against the constitutional au
thority oT the sovereign, have been dispersed in
ihefe provinces. These writings were fubftantial
!y the fame as th." speeches delivered in the midst
of the authorised societies, in which the most at
(.rocious crime* have been recommended as vir
tues, with a view to flatter ihe criminal propenfi
lies of a set of men, in hope* of reconciling them
: to a system, which 111 history will be the disgrace
! of the present generation.
All our remonstrances on this fubjeft have been
i made in vain ; and whilst we paid the greatest at
tention to complaints relative to armaments which
had no existence, and to pretended infuks offered,
to Frenchmen, all kinds of excefles have been mul
tiplied against the fubjeft of his Majesty, and com
mitted on his territories, and we have never ob*
tained on so many obje&s of complaint, any thing
more ?han promises of fatisfa&ion, which have iu
no inftancc been performed ; ana when we have,
on our part, exercised that vigilance, which was
become neceflary on the conduct of emifliarics,
who it was boasted openly, were sent into thole
provinces, on purpose to excite infurrettions and
10 create anarchy, we have been insulted for hav
ing taken ihofe precautions, which were construed
into attempts against the fafety aud liberty of
French travellers. On the other hand, we were
applauded for having given orders to prevent the
allemblmg of the unfortunate French gentlemen
who had emigrated from the kingdom, and to o
blige them to conform moll ftriftly to the laws of
simple hospitality, in order to preclude the pofli-.
bility of iheir arming and forming thcmfelves
into military corps. (Concluded in our next.)PARIS, May 9-

account of his death :
Relation of the siffajfination of M. The
obald Dillon, Marechal dc Lamp, at
Lift, ths 2t)th of April, 1792.
BY AN EYE WITNESS.
I DINED at Gen. Theobald Dillon's
the day of the expedition at 1 our
iiiay. In the course of the conversa
tion, he many times teftified his con
fidence in the good dilpofition and
courage of the ti oops he commanded.
Although I had been for. thel'e fifteen
years his intimate friend, it was not
until after the orders had been given
to the troops, that I knew he was to
march the fame evening.
He quitted me in the afternoon to
go to Gen. Daumont ; at half palt 7
o'clock the troops were under arms ;
they had the belt appearance pollible
âa little before' nine o'clock he went
out at the head of the army, by the
gate of Kiffe. The next day [Stinday
April 29 ] at 9 o'clock, I went to Gen.
Daumont, to alk him if there was any
impropriety iu my going to viewÂ»the
army, and if it was not necefl'ary to
have a paflport ? Ire replied in the
negative.
Madame Dillon tcflified great nn
eafinefs for her brother, but he as
sured me that it was without founda
tion ; and from the orders army
had received, an enji.iger.ient was not
likely.
I mounted on horftback, and de
parted by the gate of Fiffe, in order
to fee M. Diil'on. At a place near
the town I met four dragoons, who
\as soon as they saw me made Signs by
their sabres for me to return ; crying
that all was loftâThat the army had
been betrayed, and cut in pieces. I
begged them not to fprcad the alarm
in the town : but firft to acquaint
Gen. Daumont, and the principal of
ficers of it.âThey soon lefc me be
I returned into town with a
man without an uniform, who relat
ed that his comrade was killed by
his fide : with him was an officer of
the national guards, on a horse be-
Jonging to one of the artillery carri
ages, who also cried that all was 1011,
betrayed, and cut to pieces, but he
could not give any detail of particu
lars.
I took my domestic with me, and
returned again on foot to the gate of
Fiffe. The. street was full of fuldiers
and national guards, who impeded
the paflage of the cuirafliers,\vlio be
fan to enter in crowds with great
iforder. The Swiss of Dieiback,who
guarded the gate, had ereiTted forne
works and stationed patroles on the
outside : in the mean time the caval
ry- entered, raising the cry of trea
son, aristocrat, and a la lantern
The confulion now became gene
ral ; many, without knowing who
commanded, demanded the head of
Kochambeau ; I then went to the
fuburbi ; the infantry nowprefeuted
themselves, but in small numbers ;
the road was covered with cavaliers,
â¢11 crying treason. Not one wnnnd
ed, not even a horse ; I asked niaiiv
officers and soldiers news of the Ge
neral ; not one could give me any
account of him ; an officer of cuiraf
liers laid, that he was surprised to
hear me ask news of a general who
had led thein to butchery. The de
puty marflial general (M. de V )
said that M. Dillon had given him
orders to charge the cavalry.
soon as he perceived the enemy, he
found them retiring and in general
confulion. Ihe soldiers informed
me it would be imprudent to advance
further ; that the Austrian Huflars
piefled themclofely ; 1 Hopped some
time, and advanced again. I had
not yet heard the i eport of a fufce
nor seen n hulTar, nor any perfontlm
had seen one. The road was now
crouded with carts of baog 3ge and
peasantry, who fled with theirinove

was told, gave him a cut on the head
with his sabre, and firec{ a piliol at
his brealt. Then thenatioiial guards
and infantry took poflt'Hion ot hiui.
! saw one of the rtultiinn prisoners
killed, and two or three who were
dif'patcbed, trampled under feet, and
their bodies run through.
I heard the ridicule and the bar
barous fliouts of the foldicrs, and law
them amuie themselves in linking
the dead bodies with their h<inds.
They were crouded in a wheel-bar
row, with tlte officer of engt'necrs.
I Ihudder at the light. The munici
pal officers arrived with a cart, in
which they placed the dead bodies,
and continued to abuse them. It is
two o'clock, and I have not been able
to hear the lead news of (he Genei al,
or the aiftion. Not a wounded mart
has yet appeared, and among ail the
soldiers, not one C:fcivrs to have been
in battle, except a foot ibldier, who
had received ibine fliot through his
hat.
1 remained in the street to observe
the dispositions of the people About
four o'clock 1 went towards Fiffe
gate. In the entrance of the street
the agitation' was great,and the howl
ing terrible. At last 1 heard
the cry of " He's coming, he's com
ing, lo the lantern." I asked, with
a trembling voice; who ? Di}lon,fhey

Rocbambeau mult alio perifti, and
all ihe nobility in the army. Dillon
is coming in a cabriole ; his thigh is
alreaily broken, lei's go and finiCi
him. The cabriole soon appeared ;
the General was in it, without a
with a calm and firm look ; he was
cfcorted by four horse guards ; he
had hardly pafled through the gate,
when more than an hundred bayon
ets were ihroft in the cabriole amidst
the mo!t horrible shouts ! The horse
guards made use of their sabres, it is
true, but 1 don't know whether it
was to defend theinfelves or to pro
teÂ»ii the General. The man who
drove the cabriole disappeared, the
horse plunged, and no bayonets had
yet been fatal, when a shot was fired
into the carriage, and I think this
killed M. Dillon, for I never saw him
move afterwards : he was taken from
the carriage and thrown into the
street, when they trampled upon his
body, and run a thousand bayonets!
through it. I neither heard from
him complaints or groans,
Between fever, and eight o'clock I
went to the marker-place, where a
great fire was lighted, in which his
body was thrown. French soldiers
danced round the burning body of
their General ; this barbarous (cene
was intermixed with the 1110 ft savage
howlings. Parties of Swiss were pall
ing and repaliing in good order dur
ing this atrocious scene, with the
greatelt indignation painted in their
countenances. The filter of the Ge

orders remained constantly attached
!:o the late king, and at the diet of
iGcfie gave him the greatert proofs of
[their love for hfm, and unlimited
'confidence in his wfiidont. What waÂ«
advanced respecting the propositions
of ihe late king, touching an annual
jlupply of 1,100,000 ounces of silver,
the payment of his private debts,and
the opening of a loan for ten milli-
Jons, is equally falfe. The firft pro
Ipofition was never made by the king,
j hut was an arrangement proposed by
the lecret committee itfelf, aiifl. was
approved ofby the rtates. With re
gard to the fecoiid, i'uch an one could
never have been made, as the king
had no private debt ; and as to the
third, lb far from defiling the open
itig of a new loan for ten millions,
his inajefty had the latisfaJtion of re
nutting to thefecret corrnnitteea letter
ot credit for that fom, which the coi;;-
mitttee had left at his disposal lad
year,but which he had not made ufeof.
The equestrian order,in communicat
ing to the public the protocal of its de
liberations, only ditLwhat was cufloni
ary ; 110 rigorous measures were tak
en to interrupt the publication of the
deliberations of the orders of the
peasants, or to hinder the publication
of the (tate of the finances ; and the
restraint laid on the press was only
confined to the printing of certain
pamphlets, calculated to iniflesd the
public. Many public prints also con
tained an account of some pretended
representations, couched in very
strong terms, which the states of Swe
den madeto the king at the late diet,
refpe<fting his participation in the
affairs of France.â All these reports
are absolutely (aj,fe, as duiinir the
whole time ofthe alTetnhiy, there was
no mention made of France, further
than the paflage in the speech of his
Majesty at the opening of the diet.

HARTFORD, July 9.
THE deftruiftion of Apples, by the
canker-worm in various pans of the
country is a serious and alarming ca
lainity ; and it is the duty of every
man to contribute his mite towardj
retraining and avoiding the evil.
About a year agoa iel'pectablcgeit.
tleman who is more than eigbtyyeaia
of age, remarked to me, " that tbii
species of worrm never touch apnle
trees which stand 011 clay." I cast
my eyes over the orchards in this
tow", and found the
by fait*. In the center of the town,
where the foil is moiliy a pure ftiff
clay, not a tree was affected by thiÂ»
devouring animal, and this gentle,
man informed me, the fad had been
the fame ever since his remembrance.
I have lately made a journey 10 the
and am, by particular ob
servations, convinced of the truth of
the fa<ft. 1 find Wherever orchards
it and on clay, or a cold moid springy
Toil, tJie trees remain untouched. A
gravelly foil is riot friendly to these
worms ; but if the gravel is mixed
with a fofc light earth, the trees (here
on are conliderably injured. On the
01 her hand,'gravel mixed with a hard'
clayey earth never admits the worm.
In snort, the lighter the earth where
the trees stand, the earlier the worms
appear and the more complete ihei'r
ravages. ,
These fadls suggest to farmers the
propriety of chooling such spots on
their farms for their orchards, as do
not admit the worm ; for hard clay
and cold moid earth do not futnilh
this animal with agreeable lodgings.
| 1 would further jnlt hint to far
mers who have not a choice of foils
I for orchards, the possibility that by
plowing or digging up the earth un
der the trees, just before winter, and
exposing the worm to the action of
rain and froft, they may perhaps de
ft roy them or so leflen the number,as
to save the fruit of the succeeding
year.

MR. FENNO,

fubjeft of the conteftcd eiedtion in the State of
New-York, in which.the writer fays, that votes
in favor ot Mr. Jay were rejected by the can
vassing committee,. 44 because the name was
not orthographically written, and according to
tne latest improvementsv/hile at the fame
time this very committee admitted 44 fun dry
votes which came up under exactly parallel cir
cuniftances with tho e proscribed." The votes
of the rejejffced counties, the writer further fays,
he is informed, were left till the scrutiny had
proceeded lo far as to evince, that the election
would be loiT: to them if the whole were ad
mitted. Tncn were questions made which
would probably have never been moved, had an
evident majority appeared in their favor.â

Seringapatam, by the forces under Lord Corn
wallis. The whole now appears to be a fabri
cation in London, for jobbing purpoies. Later
and authentic intelligence, ftafes, that Corn
wailis had taken some small fort 1 ?, was on his
march towards Seringapatam, and that Tippo
had made lome proportions for peace, which
were not acceded to.

cinnati in that itate.
We are informed in the National Gazette of
Saturday last, that the new regulation of the
poft-ofiice in refpeft to newspapers, is u an un
happy affair, and will make the ensuing general
election not so iatisfactory a touchstone of the
public mind as it ought to have been. For it
is certain that in many places where the infor
mation contained in the papers will not now
I circulate, the elections will turn very differently
from what they would, if the people knew as
much as is known here on the spot."
The Salem Gazette some time ago contained
a remark to the fpllowing purportâ u Some
printers, at the feat of goverment, seem to think
that the people at a distance from that favorite
/pot, are so ignorant, that they know nothing."
The author of the above quotation from the
National Gazette, ft undoubtedly well informed;
for it is certainly true that the people in the
different parts of the Union, are determined to
fee, hear and judge for themselves ; and altho"
t!iey have been admonished, catechized,
corrected, berated, beduped, befooled, and
otherwise politely, candidly, honestly and fairly
treated for more than nine months palt, bv the
truly benevolent, federal and principled fup
portcrs of the National Gazette Yet alas 1
alas ! u the elections will turn very differently
from what" thele Â£ige conservators, of re pub

Alas ! alas ! that this is true.

(ep.tf)FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FENNO, .
YOU ave requested torepublifli the following,
being the proceedings of the People of Otfego
County, in consequence of the high-handed in
fringement as they conceive, of their rights of
iuffrage in the lace election of Governor, &c.
I aui the more induced to request this, as the
eonduA of the friends of Mr. Jay, who really
were the majority on this occasion has been very
unfavorably reprefeuted in a paper publiihed
in this city entitled the National Gazette.
The eftimaies of votes, extracts of letters from
New-York, paragraph, &c. in that National Ga
zette are meerly'quotations from the mod viru
lent publications 011 the fubjedt which have ap
peared in New-York ; but have been brought
forward with fotnuch zeal and attention, as to
(hew tbac one spirit actuates the whole of the
junto, who will ltick at nothing to carry points.
Tn the National Gazette of the 14th inft. they
fay, that the measures adopted by the electors of
the State of New-York to obtain redress of their
violated rights " is one of the blefied effe<fts of
that policy, which prpfefl'es to check the levity
of popular government, by the introdudlion of
Toryifin, and coutrouling the predominant spi
rit of democracies by throwing the Tory weight
into the federal scale." The RÂ«folutions, are
spirited, patriotic and federal ; they are a genu
ine exhibition of the spirit of '75.
At a numerous Meeting of the Freeholders of the
county of Otfego, State of New-York,hild the thir
tieth day of fune t at the Court-House, on the fo
let/m occajion of taking into consideration the vio
lent attack made by a majority of the caitvajfcrs on
the SuFFRAGtstf the freeholders of said county ;
Samuel Tubbs, iu the chair. After fame time
/pent in debating, the meeting appointed fames
Applin, Solomon Pier, Darius Warren, Isaac
Stacy, Daniel Johnfton, Jof;ph Cuher,' John
Adams and Rufus Hall, to be a committee to re
port to tht Meeting certain resolutions, proper for
of this county to adopt and pursue,
when after due deliberation, the committee returned
with the following resolutions, which were unani
tnoufiy adopted by the faeeting.
I, T} ESOLVED, That we resent the inflnua
-TV. tions promulgated by vile defamers, of
our being compelled to vote through fearâand,
that we are not in poffeflion of property enough
to entitle us to vote for governor, by the laws
of this State ; that being the language of vajfals
to a tyrant only.
11. Resolved, That we will hold in perpetual
contempt the names of those hardy and chofeu
seven canvaflers, who with deliberate wickedness,
deprived us of the rights of citizenlhip contrary
to law, good conscience and common sense.
111. Resolved, That we will revere the memo
ry of the virtuous four, who protested against the
infalt committed on the sacred rights of more
than c,welve hundred freeholders, whose feelings
are as acute, andj views (in transmitting to pos
terity their invaluable privileges) as liberal as
those of any other part of this State.
IV. Resolved, That we now report to the ci
tizens of this State that there are EIGHT HUN
DRED and TWENTY families now fettled in
the town of Oifego, as per the last return, luoft
of which are freeholders entitled to vote for go
vernor, although falfe and bale men have advi
sed that there is not one hundred.
V. Resolved, That those law characters who
palled through our county procuring affidavits
from vagrant persons, and unprincipled wretch
es, are unworthy our notice, feeing that theit
views were calumny pointed against a valuable
inhabitant among us, the father of our country.
VI. Resolved, That we will pursue with man
ly firmneft such modes of redress as the well
wishers to the State of New-York, fliall advise us
from time to time.
VII. Resolved, That if not advised to the con
trary we will as one man quietly march down to
New-York, and solicit of the legislature our dear
est and highly prized rights, as a teftitnony to
our children that they may fee that their fathers
did not quietly fu'jmit to a precedent operating
in favor of tyranny.
V ill Resolved, 1 hat we consider tlie prefeiu
adminiflration no less an usurpation than that of
the famous Kouli Khan, that being obtained by
the facrifice of one man, this by facrificin iT the
privileges of twelve hundred.
IX. ReTolved, That as it hath been reported
we were unfairly influenced to oppose the re
election of the prelent governor, that we unani
mously deny the charge, and will contradidl that
envious inlinuation by listing the reasons of our
objections as follows.
lit. Because, was he a good man, he has al
ready been too long in that important office.
2d. Because, he was a vigorous oppofer of
that conjlitution that has been the salvation of
our country ; that has made us refpetfable at
foreign courts, and nervous in our domestic ope
rations ; that has raised the soldiers pay from
2/6 to 20/ on the pound. To prevent the adop.
tion of which he came forward with ignorant
obstinacy and threw the State into violent par
A. E.
Your's,
ties, only kept from desperate aifrs by an over
ruling Providence.
3d. Because, he is a man of passion and party,
and of re fe 11 tin en i" deeper than i\\e grave.
4th. Bccanfe, he joined in an advertifemcnt,
purporting to tiie good people of this State, to
bringdown information to of the
lands they wanted to purchase, with their boun
daries and price, and wait fix weeks tor an an
swer. Many went and returned didatisfied, de
claring, that they were only made tools of, to
carry down information of the boundaries of
good lands that the governor's friends l>y bid
ding above them, might engross the whole.
Jth. Because, we humbly conceive that he was
not so ignorant as nor to know, that after felling
at more than three (hillings per acre many large
tracts of lands that others equally well licuated
were worth more than Bdâat which price,he has
fold near Jour million of acres, to Alex. Mc'Comb,
with a privilege of leaving one or two sixths of
the mountains on the hands of the people of this
State, for a trifling forfeiture ; molt of which
land we firmly believe our brethren of New-En
gland, would gladly pay interelt for at the rate
of eight shillings per acre ; which leads us to
consider (his single J'ale, as a facrificeof near one
million of money, not to mention the nature of
the sale, being discouraging to agriculture and
the commerce of this State, as it is now for sale
in Europeâwho when they own the foil, will
certainly turn the commerce through their own
government of Canada.
6th. Because, for hidden purpofcs, he com
-111 if honed the infamous Crijwold, in our county,
and since that has made partial and difgulting
appointments amongtt lisâfor the purpose we
verily believe of raising a party devoted to his
designs.
7th. Because, a majority of the people of this
State do not approve of him.
Bth. Becaule, JOHN JAY is a better man.
~ 9th. Because, when men in polls of great trust,
are partial to a party, they become dangerous
anil ought to be removed ; as the present in
llance of the canvall'ers att'ords a striking figure.
When our sacred privileges, every other way
so well guarded,were trulted in the hands'of cor
rupt men, they were flagrantly violaied and we
left in a deplorable lituation. Therefore,
10. Resolved, That as we have seen the rea
sons afligned by the fcvm canvaflers for their
conducfi, we are unanimoiifly of opinion, that ic
is a frivolous excuse for such a violent outrage.
âThey fay " there was rtafon to fufpedl fraud"
Would those monsters in iniquity destroy us
on suspicion without a hearing ? Why did they
not declare the truth at onceâ" That they fuj~-
peftedthe box of Otfego would, if cauvejfed, remove
Ciorge Clinton from office," which was certainly
the sole cause they were rejected.
it. Resolved, That we do now pledge our
selves to each other, not to fenarate till the lafc
extremityâthat we will pay cheerfully, accord
ing to our abilities, such expence as may strife
in regaining our rights, and fixing a lasting ftig
ina cn tliofe veterans in corruption who have
rended from us that which is more valuable to
poUcrity than our lives ! âTheinfult is too great
for the fouls of FREEMEN to bend to !
