M th GAS.tr If of the ONI rim STATES.
MR. FENN'O,
A WRITER in a laic Wilmington paper, in
fornt (Iti&torca on the oew proposed Cotifli
lution for the State ot flclawate, rrprbbalei the
article which iroderÂ»thÂ« Clernv ineligible to feats
in the Le^ifUture âthii he corifidets as a vtolauon
of .equal tights, a* degrading that order ul men to,
the condition of (laves, ar.d the offspring of flives.
In anfwcrto thcfe remarks, a writer tfi the Tame
payer oblcrtefr***" If there cxift* a c4Â«fi tff men
who by the influence-of their proUfQon,
or by any other iufluence, exacpt that of talents
end virtue, could gain feats in the Legtflature, such
clifirof met* faobld be excluded. Is there no]
dtngtr to be apprehended from eloquent and
crafty Priests ? Could not such command' a4l Â«br-l
1 votes Â»od all the influence of their congregations ?
1 He (word of religious discord, which has denrofr
ed more than plague, peftilcnce and famine, has
loft its edge in thtfc fhtcs. We have seep in a
public piotcfficm, Christian Mmifters of dtifeient
denominations walking arm in aim with a Rabbi
of the Je*s. Cut is there no danger of foment
mgafrefh trilgiona difienttons, by exciting in the
laity of different denominations, a conceit for the
eanyingof their refpeft've Priests ? Or is there uo
danger that such conufts would be excited ?"
Oft which a correspondent remaiksâThat the
reasoning contained in the above quotation, is fub
veifive of every principle of right, justice and 1
freedom. To point out, and ftigmatiae any cla&
or profetfion of citizens, by disqualifying diftinc
tioirs, is cleat!y an'invafion of ludcfeafible righi* ;
to deprive them of their rank in focifty, antece
dent to any ad by which they have incurred pte
n.foment, is unjust ; and a community to hold a
perpetual proscription over the heads of a panicu- 1
lar body of men, is an outrage against libeity that
every one pofleflitig a paiticleof benevolence irttlft
revolt sr.
But why talk of u eloquent and crafty PriefU"â
are tht re not eloquent and crafty Lawyers, Mer
. chairs, Physicians, Farmers and others ?â 41 Cun
ning and cralty" are convertible teims, fomctimes
meaning one thing, and fbmetimes another. In
Merchants, Lawyers, Farmers, See. they Agnify
address and found reafomogâbut applied to the
Clergy, they always have a wicked meaning. An
implacable spirit towards the Clergy, has been dis
covered in many recent publicationsâfor wbai
good rcafon does not appear. Certain it is that no
defcriptior* of pcrfons have (hewn thernfelves
greater friends'to liberty and the independence oi
the United States, than ttf* Cleigy. But there are
some individuals in emcmg rts, who arc so te
nactons of the rights of man, that they wilh to dfc
i pi ive the people of thenght oi i hiuking and
, ing for themlclvcs. Tbeie cieclatmeis for the peo
Â» pic, are for taking the people under their own
â  (ruardiaiiihipâand to prevent the people from
being imposed on by craft and cunnirtg, they would
deprive them of the right of electing those whom
the people may suppose the best qualified to P'Â°*
mote their interefLâ It would be just as wife to
prohibit the people from electing any m>n who
weaÂ«s a black coat, or a wig, as to exclude 'he
Clergy from the Legislatures in this country ; where
the clerical proleflion boasts ot no legal andexclu
five privileges, and where it can never be made an
/ engine of, unless by unjust clcrgymcn
i fh.micV be compelled to form combinations in their
own defence.

IT :i an obvious truth, that every thing i<;
more valuable in proportion to the number
and extent of it? iifei, or the pwrpofes to which
it cm be advantageously tr;>iriie*l. Flas, hemp,
wool, iilk, cotton, incline, tobacco, hides, iton,
wood, nain, and cattle, are valuable, wliert
they are wanted merely a? exports; but they
ttanif'efUy acquite a nfew v.il-ie, when wanted
to eAiploy, accommodate of hduTrfli manufac

cannot be exported, without a great expenl'e of
t r.uiijortapoii, it is very desirable to give theli)
this/r'cuii life : but in situations too inteiior trt

HOUSE OF RE I'RESENT AT WES,
THURSDAY, APRIt. 12, I7p 2
MILITIA BILL.
The feflion empowering the President oj
the United States to call out the Militia,
added as an amendment to the bill by
the Senate, under consideration,
MR. MERCERoppofed thefeciion.
He considered the fubjecft too
Important to receive a halty decision ;
and as the fcffion is so near its close,
and no immediate necefiity exilts to
inaUethe provision, he hoped it would
be postponed to the next session.
Mr. Steele objected to the fec'tionâ
he considered it as having an inaulpi
cious alpeiftâthat it was-an insult to
the majesty of the people to hold out
the idea that it may be neceHary to
execute the laws at the point of the
bayonet. He moved as an amend
ment, " that nothing in this av!t ftjall
be construed to empower the Pi eli
de nt to march the militia of oneitate
into another." He said he had no
doubt that there were in every (late
a fufficient number of persons well
informed, and attached to govern
ment, to quell any infurreftion, and
to restore good order.
Mr. Ben (oh supported the fec'tionâ
he observed that the question mult be
met some time or otherâand he con
ceived that it would be a perfetft nul
lity to pass a militia law without the
provision contemplated by the amend
mentâfor, he asked, to what purpose
is it to constitute a militia, if they are
not to be made any use of to fu.ppo.rt
the laws. According to a doctrine
whieh was avowed /in the lionfe yes
terday, the inftittition of a militia is
to enable (he individual states to op
pose the encroachments which may
be made on them by the general go
vernment ! This he conceived was an
entire new dotfrine, such a dodrine
as Was never before heard of. What
fort of government mult that be,
which is authorized to pass J,aws, and
at the lame time has nopoAer to car
ry those laws into execution ? He said
that' such a discretionary power was
lodged in the supreme executive of
the several dates, and for exacflly the
fame purposes fpecified in the amend
ment; and he had never heard it ob
jected to before Gentlemen contend
that this power is proper, as it re
fpeds the several states, but highly
improper as it refpeifts the govern
ment of the United States. What
sow of a fit nation said he, does this
place this government in ?
Mr. Williamfon objected to the
amendment, as imperfeA in its con
ftrutftion, and as containing some dan
gerous principles.
Mr. Livermore also opposed the
amendment.
Mr. Gerry opposed the amend
nieht, as veiling a dangerous power
ill tli-e fnpreme executive; that cir
cum fiances did not render the dele
gation neceflary. The people of the
leyeral states appear disposed to sub
mit to the laws, and foch an exigency
ought not to be anticipated.
Mr. Murray said he had voted in
the affirmative 011 the amendment
which had just been annexed to the
amendment from the Senate, because
it. limit ted the duration of a power
which (Iruck his mind as rather large
and undefined as to its obje&s. He
fhoukl now vpte againfi; the whole as
amended ; and he was at liberty so to
do, inasmuch as he had voted for the
amendment, because he wiflied, if the
gift of such power was to be made
to circumscribe at leafl its duration
He profeflwd' himfelf a friend to ener
gene government, but wiihedtocom
municate such energy through well
defined channels, and to fee it direst
cd towards conflitutional objeifts. He
would go as far as mofl men in en
forcing the laws of the unionâin pro
viding tor the calling out of the
flrength of the community topreferve
peace and repel forceâbut he could
not accede to the idea contained in
the provision of' that fetfiion, which
was, that the time; the cause, and the
place in which the militia were to be
called our ; fholild be all left to the
dil'cretion of one man. The theory
of the gctfernhienc warranted no Rich
dereliction of power in this House,
nor its delegation to another. He
imagined that as the conllitution had
cotitcinplU.cecl the organizing of the
militia fepaiately from the pvovifion
for calling them into acfin'dl service,
H wonld-be most proper to fepai'ate
these different objects in lcgiHation.
He tl'ierefore hoped the amendment,
as amended, would be negatived, and
ihar a committee would be appointed
immediately to bring in a bill to ac
compliih its with proper mo
difications. To.create and organise
a militia, was one thingâto provide
for calling it forth to executethe laws
of the union, fupprcfs irifurredtions,
and repel invasions, was another and
separate object. ' These things were
as separate in their natures, as they
were diverfified by relative inferio
rity and magnitude of objects. The
ingenuity with which a weapon is
formed, bears no comparifqn with the
principles and wisdom under which
its life and direction are to beappl : ed.
Of all the offices of politics, the uioft
ii kfome and delicate is that by which
a legislature diredsthe military force
of the community to its own corfer
vation, as it presupposes lit nations i M
which rcfiltance to the goveriment
itfelf is contemplated. Hence wt fee
a jealousy even in England of the use
of the (word, when drawn agcinff
any prrt of the community. Jtwas
surely the duty of Congress to define
with as much accuracy as poflible uole
situations which are to jultify thei
execution in its interposition of ami
litacyforce. Thebillhehad in view,
he hoped, would, attempt to mark
with precision the objects the coi.'lii
tuiion looked towards, under the
words " execute the laws ofthe union,
and suppress infurredlions." What
was the occasion to warrant force of
.hat species, was the fit It obje<ftâwho
was to judge of its exigence, was ano
therâ the space or diltrirt to which
; be daught should be or not be con
fined, was anotherâand the duration
ofthe service, another. Amongthefe
â conliderations, it could not be for
gotten that the civil arm was ever to
be united, if not commanding; and
how far the marshals and judges of
the courts of the union ought not to
have a power on this fubjeft, deserv
ed more time than the Houfc feenied
inclined at present to give this bill.
He would take the occasion to declare
he had no jealoujy as to abnfes of
powerâbut this government is to be
administered according to written
[ law, applying to defined objects and
situations. It was a government of
definition, and not of ti uft and dis
cretion. After the objetfts are well
described upon which the military
force is to a<ft, the evidence ,of the
occasion fettled, and the sphere and
duration limited, lie would heartily
support the mod energetic mode in
which the objed '/hould be reached,
and the ocafionobeyedâ he therefore
hoped the amendment would be ne
ganved, and leave given for a com
mittee to bring in a separate bill

BALTIMORE, June 5-
By the Brijgantine Greyhound, Captain Ellas
Porter, who arrived here in thirteen days from
â¢Cape-Fr&ncois, we are informed, that the fitua
â¢ tibn of affairs, refpefting the difturbanles in
Hifpaniola, wore e ry day a more melancholy
afpe#â-that all hopes of peace being rcftored,
were relinquiihcd-âthatthe colony was,beyond a
'ievably loftâthat, till latterly, some
expiations were entertained of the arrival of
more troop:, from but then every profr
peÂ£t of that nature had closed in despairâthat
attacks were made, almost every night, on the
out-ports contiguous to the Capeâthat the mi
litary forte was sb enfeebled, that a general
maJfacre was apprehendedâ-that the whites
were emigrating daily, and it was thought that,
in.the course of a few months, not one would
be found remaining on the French part of the
I .landâthat it was confidently believed, that
some celebrated characters (atnong whom iz
fnppOfed to be the well known Count d'E ,
who had, a little before, arrived in a clandeftiqe;
manner from France) were the chief a&ors a
mong the revolted mulatt<Je r âthat the Colonial
AfTembly was in a state of tlje molt ruinous a
naYchy, the members having, on the day before
Captain Porter failed, carried their differences
on political opinions so fa*-, that they actually
drew their swords on each other, and the house
would have been drenchcd in blood, had not the
interposition of some left turbulent spirits sub
sided the dreadf-il ferment.

23, 1792, to a gentleman in this to\vn, re

It ought in justice to be observed that the bu

moil candor, harmony and li'oerality. Nothing
of party spirit, private aniniofity or perfonai
abuse, was introduced in any of the debates.
The tendency of the public aÂ£ts, is to promote
Â£nd encourage the agriculture, manufactures,
commerce, and literature of this fbate, to open
a field for the exertion of enterprise and icdnf
try, and to communicate to every class of peo
ple the full en joyment of their rights as menand
citizens. Notwithstanding many liberal grants
and appropriations were made, such was the fa
vorable iituation of our finances, that it was
finally determined not to be necessary at this

âEven the bible is made out of rags !
And yet people will not save their rags ! Au
thors, printers, arts, sciences, and records ail
depend on rags for support, and yet rags are
thrown away. Great people, that is people really
great, save rags. Why ? because though saving
rags is a very little thing, yet it is a little thing
that has great ese&s. i'oor people, who are re
ally poor, that is, people who are not poor and
proud, save rags. Why ? because every little helps.
\ few pounds of rags bring a few pence, and
pence feed hungry children. But iniddlingpeo
ple, who are above want and below affluence,
will not save rags. Then let them put the bu
'finefs into the bands of little folks ; children and
maids. Tell Molly and Eetty to keep a rag bag
in a handy placeâ-give them all the pcnce that
their rags will produce. Their minds are not
above the butfinefsâthey will think of itâthey
will buy a cap or a hat with a year's collection
of rags ; and the rags will make a bible or a

multiplied by the number of shares, makes the

Extract oj a letter from Mr. Maury, Ccrtful for the
United States at Liverpool, to the Secretary oj State,
dated April 9, 1792.
u It is peculiarly incumbent on all Matters
if American vessels coming hither, toufe every
)rafticable precaution to be in-order.
u The brig Sukey, William Barker, mailer,
from South-Carolina, is under difficulties, and
he cafc appears a Angularly hard one. Previ
ous to leaving America, the master had those of
lis crew not natives sworn before a magistrate,
vhofe qualification was authenticated by the
Britifli Consul* Thefc men, on being examined
lere on oath, and their declarations riot acCord
hg with those they had made in America, the
teflfeT is flopped, and tho' I hope Ihe will still be
either admitted to entry or re leafed, yet the
celay and other inconveniencies will be very
great. The matter is now before the Lords of
the Treasury.â-I submit with deference the
propriety ef making this tr an faction public, that
V. may produce more caution."
A loan was necessary to carry into efifeft the
measures planned by the legiftature of the Uni
ted States for the protection of the frontiers ;
t'ie Itgijlature accordingly dire&edthis loan to be
made âthe Bank of the United States have
lc ined the sum wanted, at an interest of five per
cmt. per annum, this is called plundering the
people !
It seems that if the government wants nio
n?y it rauft borrow it, without interest-âor wait
11 the taxes are collectedâwhat apity they had
not applied to the dK-ivtereJic-d fault-finders !
In we fee a penetrating philosophical
mind duped by the advocates of religious fu
pcrftition and imposture. The clergy found him
tv>o great a man not to be drawn over to their
iide, and therefore accomplished their object in
the fame maimer as they formerly did with
Boyle, Locke, Newton, Addifon, &c. in England.
A Layman advocating fuperilition is always a
choice morsel for the clergy. See National Gazette
oj Monday l*fi.
A correspondent observes On the above, that
; the men who are tllere represented as the dupes
of superstition and imposture, were among the
nu>ft distinguished benefactors of mankind that
ever lived, and principally on account of their
being men of religion and virtue. The re igi
011s and moral character and sentiments of these
celebrated philosophers have been a u morsel"
to infidels that they could never digestâBut it
is to be lamented that it was reserved for this
enlightened age to produce an ailaflin of their
fame, men of common sense, or common ho
nesty.
~ The abufcrs of government pretend lliat they
pre only cxeicifing a right given them by the con
ftitutioli, for the purpoic of preventing abulcs, but
how unreasonable vs it thus to take the advantage
and under the clokc of duty to commit Â£rÂ»or.
May wc not be 1-eve in charity to our own coun
trymen, that they make but a small number of
(his rials, and that a majority of thcai are persons
from other countries who having lately escaped
from bondage, know not how to enjoy liberty."

I GO, my Love, and till we meet again,
Let hope and constancy the time beguile;
Again to meet, that profpeft (hall reftiain
The tears that start thro' my dissembled smile.
Farewell! but there is finirfi'd all my HoaO,
That tender accent takers <>n my tongue;
Ami I roust weep for that dear object 1011.
On which I gat'd so fondly and Co long.
O (lop, and turn, for ! have much to fay
One word, one look, I cannot leave thee so!
Ah me, (he take* a distant diff'rent way,
And I, unheard, unanswered, vent my woe.
From her foft voice no more I catch the found,
No more her beauties grace happy fide ;
I call, I search in vain, no more is found
My sweet companion and my promis'd bri^e.
Back to those happy scenes, remembrance fly,
Thy lenient aid my sorrows shall remove ;
For thou from those dear moments can'ft supply
Full many a proof propitious to my love.
Much tho' I lov'4, I found that love repaid,
And feem'd of afll men happy o'er the reft;
Consenting beauty heal'd the wound it made,
And love enflav'd me but to make me blest.
My lips the (lory of roy bosom told,
Chcck'd by no no unkind reply;
Then fav'ring glancfes bis my tongue be bold,
And mutual paflion kindled in her eye.
The bluvh foft spreading o'er her downcafl face,
The sudden sigh half rising, half fuppreft,
The cov diilrefs which heightens ev'ry grace,
In silent eloquence her love confeft.
Hov fwect to snatch her not unwilling hand,
And alf delighted on her charms to gaze ;
While roix'd with many a kiss we fondly plan'd
The tender condutt of connubial days.
Each social virtue decks her gentle mind,
And fledfaft honor waves her banners there;
So ctyaftc a Temple, Lovi was proud to find,
And truth proclaims the parting vqw fiucere.
While Tweet remembrance thus relieves my heart.
Ah why fhoutd grief on the fair profpeft low'r ?
we shall meet, and meet no mora to part.
And Heav'n and Love Hi all bless th' expelled hour.
Then fare thee well, and to thy constant mind
Still he my mem'ry dear, tho' I am gone;
Still be each tho't, each tender wilh, confin'd
To rac, whose heart 11 full of thee alone.
Tond Hope the while shall chcar my drooping foul,
In Tweet impatience shall the time employ ;
Shall chide tht lazy moments as they roll,
And Tooth my grief with tlto'is ol future joy.

THAT cleg**sEAi< at the Falls of Delaware;fn the vicing
of Trenton, in-New-Jerfey,occupied for many years part by
; ; containing upwards of 200 acres of land, besides
a tract of woodland of about 185 acres, at the diflance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
1 renton to Lanjbcrtonj and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming orders The other
part, bounded by the said street on the east, and by the river on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined effect of situ
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be oncof the moil
f>eautiful and deferable feats in the slate. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well T finiftied brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick,
kitchen ; and commanding a very extenfivo and pleasing view of
the river* both above and below, as well as including the falls, aod
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new ftooc
coach-house and stables, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining these is a very complete granary,
rat proof and a stone cow-house, upwards of 100 feet in length,
containing thirty-one pravea stalls, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, &e v Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, isa gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich collection- of the
choicest fruit# of almost every kind, and feverai large asparagus
beds, highly manured-. At a convenient diflance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in thecentre-of the square, is a new, well
built, lfcone farm-houfe, accommodatcd with a large cheefc-room,
spring-house, garden, See. a complete (lone fmoke-lioufe, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
ceirary ouubuilding. The ground is properly divided into frmiM
fields, all well watered, highly improved, and chiefly under the
most approved grass. This square has produced annually, for fe-Â»
veral years palt, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, bc/ides
supporting through the summer season tweutv to thirty horned
cattle., and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chard* of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper fealons,
with great plenty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frefh water
in this climate, and with .a variety of wild-fowl; bi>th of whicli
may afford a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addiuon to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is inclosed and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar posts,
and rails of chefnut and white cedar. The purchafcr may have
