FROM THE COLUMBIAN CENT IN EL
MR. RUSSELL,
THE next article upon Which Mr. Paine has
pronounced the superiority of the French
conflitution, is upon the fubjeOt of making war
and peace. rlie right, he fays, is placed where
the expense is ; that is in the nation.âWhereas,
" in England, the right is said to reside in a me
taphor t shewn at the l ower forfixpenceor a {hil
ling a piece." He answers himfclf again in this
pallage, and fliows the folly of placing such a
formidable right in a metaphor ; but in this in
ltance, as in the former, there is much wit, and
110 truth ; and I mult take the liberty to affirm,
in contradiction to Mr. Paine, that the French
constitution has not, nor could not place the
right of declaring war, where the expense must
fall ; and that the English conflitution has not
placed this right in a metaphor.
Ihe expense of supporting wars must in all
countries be defrayed by the nation, and every
individual must bear his proportion of the bur
then. In free countries that proportion must al
ways be determined by the representatives of
the people ; but the right of deciding when it
may be expedient to engage in a war cannot pos
sibly be retained by the people of populous and
extensive territory, it must be a delegated pow
er ; and the French constitution has veiled it in
the National Ajfembly. By the Englilh constitu
tion it is vested in the supreme executive officer :
but to guard agai 11 ft the abuse of this formidable
power, it has given to the representatives of the
people the exclusive right of providing for the
lupport of the war, and of withholding the sup
plies, " the sinews of war," if it fhnuld fver be
declared contrary to the fenf'e of the people
themselves. Mr. Paine ftippofes a perplexity
which is warranted neither by theory nor by
the experience ofhiitory, " if the one rallily de
clares war," fays he, " as a matter of right, 3iul
the other preremptorily withholds the fuppliesas
a matter of right, the remedy becomes as bad if
not worse than the disease."
But every war in Eugland tiuifl be the war of
the people : the King is in reality no more than
the organ of the nation, and inuft be more than
an idiot to declare a war, upon which he inuit
depend altogether upon them for irs ftipport,
without being certain of that fupporr. imagin
ary conclusions drawn by reafoiling againlt the
inevitable order of things, are unworthy of a
politician, andfhould be left as a feeble vefource
for the fatyrift. To have given this objetfion e
ven an appearance of plausibility, Mr. Paine
should have mentioned an initance, when this
clalhing of the the King and of the Com
mons has ever been productive of the ill effects
which his fancy has sagaciously drawn front them.
Indeed Mr. Paine himfelf, upon further re
flection acknowledges the futility of his objecti
on, and fays " that in the manner the
nation is represented, it fignifies not where this
right resides, whether in the Crown or in the
Parliament." But 1 apprehend, if the repre
sentation in England were as perfect as human
wil'dom could devise, their present fyftetn with
vefpect to peace and war, would comprize all the
advantages of the French fyfleni, and at the
fame time be iVee from many inconveniences to
which that tnull be liable.
It must be clear to every one that tlie French
have nor. as Mr. Paine pretends, united the
right anil the expense : The impracticability of
such an union, mult be equally evident ; and the
only qneftion which can eflablifh a fair ground
of comparison between the two constitutions is,
Whether it is expedient to delegate to the legif-
Jative, or whether to the executive authority,the
right of declaring war.
As l am not a convert to Mr. Paine's opinion,
that a nation has a right to do what it pleases, I
must be allowed to fay that they have no right to
make war upon their neighbours, without pro
vocation. The people by their representatives
must judge, when the provocation is Sufficient to
tliflolve them from all the obligations cf morali
ty and humanity, by which nations are bound to
prtferve the blessings of pcace. But when they
lia'e determined that the great law of felf-pre
leivation, to which all other laws mtift give way,
orthat the laws which they have enacted in con
ference of the primitive Contract which united
all their power for the benefit of every individu
al, compel them to appeal for justice to the God
of lattles, the declaration of war, the for
Wednesday, August 5, 1791.
111 al art, by which they announce to the world
their intention to employ the arm of power in
their own defence, feeins to be proper attri
bute of the executive power. The difference
therefore, between the English and French con
iHtutions conlidered in this light can involve on
ly a qnellion of propriety, and as such the En
glish appears to me to deserve the preference.
If this idea should be considered as heretical,
I must beg leave to call to my ailiftance the au
thority of Roajfeau, a name ftil! more refpertable
than that of Mr. Paine, because death has given
the ultimate fanrtion to his reputation. " The
art of declaring war," fays he in his social com
part, "and that of making peace, have been
conlidered as arts of sovereignty, which is not the
cafe; for either of those arts is not a law, but
only an application of the law ; a particular art
which determines the operation of the law, as
will be clearly perceived when the idea annexed
to the word la-w fiiall be ascertained." The spi
rit of the English conllit ution is perfertly agree
able to this idea.
But let us cnnfider the subject a little further.
Whenever a difference arises between two na
tions which may terminate in a war, it is proper
and cuflomary, that previous negotiations fliould
be held, in older to use every possible means of
fettlit.g amicably the dispute. These negotia
tions, the appointment of the agents, by whom
they are ro be conducted, and the communication
of the proposals for accommodation,' which are
offered by either of the parties, are
all appropriated ro the executive department.
When the restoration of peace becomes expedient
in the opinion of the people, agents mult again
be appointed, and proposals of pacification niuft
again be made. Ir is obvious to every man, that
in the management of these concerns the Htmoft
secrecy and dispatch are frequently of essential
neceflity to the welfare of the people ; but what
secrecy can ever be expected, when evei y inftrnc
ticn to an Ambadador, every article of a proposed
treaty, and every circumstance of information
from the minister, in the progress of his opera
tions, must be known to twelve ihundred men as
sembled in the capital of the republic ; what pro
bability of dispatch, when all these things must
be debated in this afiembly of 1200 men; where
every thing must in the neceflary order of events
be opposed, by interested individuals and irritat
ed factions, who may protract the discussion for
months or years at their pleasure.
By the constitution of the United States, it is
true, the right of declaring war is vested in the
Congress, that is, in the legiflntive power. But
it is in the point of form that it agrees with the
constitution of France ; it has wifely placed the
management of all negociations and treaties, and
the appointment of ail agents and ministers in
the executive department; and it has l'o tho
roughly adopted in this inllance the principlss of
the Englilh constitution, that although it has gi
ven the Congress the right of declaring war,
which is merely a difference of form, it has vest
ed in the President, with the advice of the Se
nate as his executive council, the light of making
peace, which is implied in that of forming trea
ties. This is not the firft instance in which Mr.
Paine's principles attack thole of the conflitu
tion of his country. Highly as we may revere,
however, the principles which we are under eve
ry obligation to support, we may without irre
verence acknowledge that they partake of the
human imperfection from which they originated,
and if Mr. Paine's principles in opposition to
tliem, are in any instance founded upon eternal
truth, we may indulge the hope, that every ne
ceflaiy improvement will be adopted in a peace
able and amicable manner by the general con
sent of the people. But if the principles of Mr.
Paine, or thole of the French National Aflembly,
would lead us by a vain and delusive pretence of
an impracticable union between the right Â»f de
claring, and the expence of supporting a war, to
the facrifice of principles founded in immutable
truth, if they could persuade us, -by eftablilhing
in the legjflative body all negociations with fo
reign nations relative to war and peace, to open
a thouland avenues for base intrigue, for furious
faction, for foreign bribery, and domestic trea
son, let us remain immovably fixed at the ban
ners of our conflitutiotial freedom, and nor desert
the impregnable fortrefs of our liberties, for the
unfubfta:itial fabric of visionary politicians.

FROM. THE GENERAL ADVERTISER.
Bruxellhs, April 21.
NEITHER the internal disturbances which
followed theinfuriection, nor the agitation
which flill exists, have been an; oppofnion to the
execution of the Emperor's intentions. It was of
importance to Leopold that the Belgic people
(hould feel the necelfity of order, and wi(h for the
return of any kind of government. Princes have
more patience than the peopleâtheyunderftand
the art of wearing out the courage of the people,
simply by fuffering them to adt. They sometimes
even irritate the unfortunate beings who fuffer,
in order to tire them the soonerâand then they
become an easy prey: They then fteo forward,
and the people contend who shall firft be placed
under their paternal protection, and adore the
iron hand that protects them. This is our his
tory.
A remarkable operation, partly commercial,
and in part political, has been performed here.
Government has granted totbehoufeof Hayeand
Co. of Krnxelles, the cxclufive privilege of buy
ing the mulkets and other arms, of the patriots
of Brabant. Who Mould credit the fhameful ea
gerness with which our citizens run to difpofeof
their arms? The company of Haye has already
bought tip an aftoniftiitig quantity; they have
upwards of 28 or 30,000 mulkets. What must we
think of this people, who resume the yoke as a
garment ? What are we to conclude from this in
conceivable docility, but that this people, the
sport of intrigue, have never acted from proper
fpirit,and a sentiment of their own dignity ; ancl
that excited, by the mere cry of liberty, by some
seditious characters, they now coliceive their past
conduct founded on an erior, and inwardly re
gret and pant after the habits of their ancient
and comfortableobedience ; The government ap
pears yet to fear a popular clamor against there
inftared States General, and are busy in protect
ing them, as the allembly,by a military force,
which is looked on by the peonle only as a di
verting fliew. This is our present situation.

It is observed that several farmers are spread

which they are like to lose what the more pru
dent will save. It is I rue, flax-feed has run low ;
but if we may credit the late accounts from Ire
land, that article will this season be in demand :
exports lall year turned out so, that it is -very
pofliblethe shipments will be larger this. Far

into the Eafl-River yesterday, from Jones's wharf.
Mr. Launcelot Chalmers, of the brig Sally of

TO THE FRENCH AMBASSADORS AND MINISTERS
Copy of a Utter frorrythc Minijler of Foreign Affairs, addrejfed by order
of the King, to all (he Ambajjadors and Mn.rjlers oj his Mujefly y in
Foreign Courts.
" SIR,
THE King has charged me to inform you, that it is his will that
you make known his sentiments refpe&ing theÃevolution and
the French Constitution to the court at which you refulc. The
fame orders arc tranfmitfed to the ambalTadors and ministers of
France, at all the courts of Europe, to the end that no doubt may
remain with regard to his majesty's intentions, his free acceptation
of the new form of government or his irrevocable oath to main
tain it.
His majcfly had convoked the States General of his kingdom,
and resolved in his council that the commons should, in that as
sembly, have a number of Deputies equal to those of the two o
ther orders ihen existing. This ast of provisional legislation which
the circumstances of the moment did not allow to be more favor
able, fufheiently announced his majesty's wish to restore the nati
on to all its l ights.
The Stares General met, and took the title of the National As
sembly ; and in a short time. a conllitution fitted to fccurc the
happiness of France, and of the monarch, took place Â»f the anci
ent order of things, under which the apparent power of the king
only served to conceal the teal power of certain aristocratic bodies.
The National Aflembly adopted the representative form of
government, conjoined with hereditary monarchy. The legisla
tive body, was declared permanent ; the choice of the miniflers
of public worship, of magistrates, and judges was given to the
people ; the executive power was conferred on the king, the
formation of laws on the legislative body, and the power of fane- 1
tion on the Monarch. The public force, both internal and ex
ternal, was 01 ganized on the fame principles, and in conformity
"with the fundamental basis of a distribution of powers. Such is
the new constitution of the kingdom.
1 hat which is called a revolution, is no more than the abroga
tion of numerous abuses that have been accumulating for ages,
through theeirors of the people, or the power of the ministers,
which was never the power of the king. Those abuses were no
less prejudicial to the nation than to the -monarch, Authority,
under happy reigns, had never ceased to attack these abuses, bin
without being able to destroy them. They exist no longer; the
nation, now the sovereign, has no citizens but such as are equal
in rights ; no despot but the law ; no organs but public officers,
and of those officers the king if the firft. Such is the French re
volution.
This mull naturally have for its enemies all those who, in the
firft moment of error,regret, on account of personal advantages,
the abuses of the ancient government. Hence the apparent divi
iion which (hewed itfelf in the kingdom, and which is daily be
coming less ; hence perhaps some severe laws and circumstances
which time will correct ; but the king, whose true power can ne
ver be diftinfl from that of the nation, who has no aim but the
happiness of the people, and no authority but that which is dele
gated to hi.m, the king has adopted without hesitation, a happy
constitution, which will at once regenerate the nation, the mo
narchy and his authority. All his powers are preserved to him,ex.
cept the dreadful power of making laws. Jt remains charged
with the power of negociating with foreign nations, with the
care of defending the kingdom, and repelling its enemies; but
the French nation will in future have no external enemies, but its
zggrefTor ; no internal enemies but those who, flill flittering
themselves with vain hopes, believe that the will of twenty-four
millions of men, restored to their natural rights, after having orga
nized the kingdom in such a manner as to leave only the memo
ry of ancient forms and abuses, is not an immoveable and irrevoca
ble conflitution.
I he mod dangerous of those enemies are they who afte& to
difleminate doubts of the intentions of the Monarch. These men
are much to blame, or much deceived. They suppose themfeves
the friends of the King, and they are the only enemies of royalty.
They would have deprived the King of the 1 *ve and the confi
dence of a great nation, if his principles and his probity had been
less known. What has the King not done to shew that he consi
dered both the revolution and the French constitution as his titles
to glory! After having accepted and fanftioned all the laws, he
has ncglc&ed no means of causing them to be executed. Since
the month of Februaiv, of the last year, he has promised \u the
bosom of rhe National Assembly, to maintain them. He has
taken an oath to do so, in the midst of the general federation of
the kingdom. Dignified by the title of the Restorer of French
Liberty, he will tranfmi* to his son more than a crown; he will
tianfmit a constitutional r oyalty.
i he enemies of the constitution are conftantlv repeating that the
King is not happy; as if it were poflibfe for a King to enjoy any
happiness but the happiness of his people. They fay that his
authoi ity is leflened, as if authority, founded on force were not
less powerful, and more precarious, than authority founded on
law. Finally that the King is not free; a calumny atrocious, if
they suppose that his will could be constrained ; absurd, if they
take for a want of freedom the consent repeatedly ex pre fled by
his Majesty to remain among the citizens of Paris, a consent that
was due to their patriotism, even to their fears, but above all to
their love.
Those calumnies however, have reached foreign courts; they
nave been repeated there by Frenchmen, who are voluntary ex
iles from their country, inuead of {baring its glory, and who, if
they are not enemies, have at least deserted their stations as citi
zens. The King, fir, charges you to defeat their intrigues and
their projects. The fame calumnies, while they spread thefalfeft
iÂ£ cas refpe&ing the French revolution, have rendered the inte' , -
tH'ns of French travellers fnfpcftcd by several neighbouring na
tions: ani. the King expressly orders you to protest and defend
ill em. Keprefent the French conflitution rti the fame as
that in which the King views it ; and leave no doubt of his in.
tew,on to maintain it to the utmost of his power. By fecurini
lie libetty and the equality of the citizens, that conflitution
lounds tncâ national profnerity on the molt immoveable bafts- it
confirms the royal authority by the laws; it prevents, bv a Mori
ons revolution, a revolution which the abuses of the old' govern
ment would probnblyfoon haveeffeSed by a dissolution of the
f," 1 ?". o',0', a . fi na "y! it will constitute the happiness of the KinÂ».
Â°j A "'i 10 f and to con 'ider it as the rule of your
conduct ought to be your firft duly.
I have frequently before communicated to you his Maicfty's
fenttments on th,s head ; but after the information he has received
of the opinion endeavoured to be cftablifhed at foreign Courts,
refpcaing what is passing in France, he has ordered me to charge
you to nuke known the contents of this letter to the government
which you res.de; and that it may be flill more public, his
Majefry has oraered it to be printed.

Revolution in Poland.
TN different foreign letters, we have already
A laid before our readers details of the events
which have lately taken place in Poland, and
which have entirely changed the Constitution of
that Republic. It cannot, however, prove un
acceptable to our readers to have the whole pro
ceedings laid before them in one connected "view.
At three o'clock in the morning of May 3d, a
number of patriots, who had preconcerted the
great objetfs which they meant to accomplish in
the fitting of the Diet that day, afl'embled in the
King's chamber. There, in the presence of the
King, they engaged to effectuate the Revolution
that day, and they pledged themselves to each
other, by a solemn engagement, not to separate
until they had accomplished their end.
The assembly was opened at the nfual hour.â
The galleries were crowded with fpeclators, and
the House was Wounded with thousands who
could not gain admission. Instead of the Mar
shals, the King liimfelf opened the felfion. He
said in substance, that " notwithstanding all as
" furances to the contrary, there was an alarming
" rumour, confirmed by the advices daily receiv
ed, that the three neighbouring Powers would
" "P and terminate all their jealosies and
" divisions at the expence of the pofleffions of
the Republic; that the only method of aflur
" lr l^> to PÂ° lan{ l the integrity of its pofleffions, and
of preserving it from the ruin which foreign
" politics were preparing for it, was to establish
" a Constitution, which should secure as internal
independence. That in this view there had
" been prepareda plan ofa Constitution, founded
" principally on those of England, and the Unit
"ed States of America; but avoiding the faults
" and errors of both, and adapting it as much as
poifibie to the local and particular circumftan
" ces of the country." In support of the infor
mation relative to the foreign powers, the King
communicated to the Diet some difyatches re
ceived from the Minifies of the Republic at
ioreign courts, Hating how eager they were to
oppose all settlement of the Constitution, and
t hat every thing Teemed to announce their holtile
designs on Poland. The King desired that the
plan, winch he fubnntted to them, might be
read and that they should proceed forthwith to
enact it into a law, if they approved of it. The
plan was accordingly read, and a very long and
important debate cook place.
All the reprefentativesof the Provinces of Vol
liyma and Podolia, declared themselves against
the new form of constitution.

LONDON, May 19,
brought about the Revolution, opposed this
with great zeal. The patriotic. n' by which \
was animated, was alarmed, by the Crown's bV
ing made hereditary. He advanced, and thr,-
hnnfelf on his ]<nees at the foot of the Thr
supplicating and conjuring his Majesty, Â«Â° ne '
"ounce his ideas of the hereditary fucceffio
the Royalry, as it would be the tomb of theVÂ°
berty of Poland." Many Representatives w
were on the fame fide, alledged the inftru'dJ
ot their provinces, which prevented them fV,
agreeing to make the Throne hereditary Tl"â¢
infilled that at lead the plan lliould be taken 7{
delibtrandum, as every other new law was nken'â¢
but a great majority of voices refufed to aeree'J 1
this. "We inuft pass the whole this day -
will not depart from this place until the whole
is accoinplilhed." The majority requested th
King to be pleased to unite with them f or tl *
acceptance and support of the new Constitution
in a solemn oath. The King called to him the
Bishop of Cracovia, and took the oath from hi s
hands. They cried out, " All those who deftre
the welfare of their country will join their King
atfift and support him." They surrounded the
throne on all fides. The King, to be seen by i|, e
Affenibly, could not remain seated ; he mounted
on the feat, and swore aloud. A great majority
of the Diet held up their right hand, followed
his example, and swore the fame. " Every man
that loves his country," exclaimed his Majesty
" follow me to the Church, and thanking God'
let us repeat the oath at the altar." All the Bi
shops, all the frcular Senators, with a great
number of the Nuncios or Representatives, ac
companied the King to Church, and there again
solemnly engaged, before the Supreme Being
and their Country, to maintain a Conftitution 5
which, combining liberty with subordination,'
and fubjedting the firft citizen as well as the la ft
to the law, secures to all the means of happiness
and gives to each citizen the true enjoyment of
his rights. It was that time seven o'clock in the
evening, TeDeum was sung, and the new Con
stitution was announced to the people by the dis
charge of 200 pieces of cannon. There were
between thirty and forty Nuncios who did not
follow the King to church. The King, with his
suite, returned to the Afl'embly House, and ad
journed tho Diet to the sth of May, after charg
ing the Marshals to give the oath to all the De
partments. The opposing Nuncios, feeing that
all retlftance was ufelels, resolved to protest
affainft the new Constitution, by the publication
of a Manifefto, after which they retired without
iioife to theiiv own lioufes. There was no at
tempt made to interrupt them, nor was any in-
Cult whatever oft'ered to their persons. Cries of
joy filled the streets, buj. this joy was the ex
pressions of pure and calm patriotism. Through
the whole day there was not the fmallelt confu
fion, nor disorder, nor riot. At eleven o'clock
the streets were so perfectly calm, that one
would scarcely believe that it had been the epoch
of a new order of things.
It is pretended, that on the eve of this menlo
rable day, a certain foreign Minister had endea
voured, by the dextrous application of 50,000
ducats, to avert the revolution ; but all was fore
seen and prevented. The bufijiefs was executed
in every point with as much address as it was
framed. On the 4th inft. eighteen Nunciospub
lifted their Manifefto againlt the proceedings of
the day before; and Mr. Suchorzewlki returned
the Cordon bleu, with which his Majesty had in
verted him fifteen days before. On the ?d May,
the port was flopped, and even foreign Ministers
submitted to the genera] order; but 011 the 4th,
exprefles were sent oft* in all directions.

tle to the fatisfadtion of a gentleman, who finds
his generous exertions amply recompensed in
the consciousness of worth ; yet we have pre
ftinied to gratify our own feelings at Jeaft, by
presenting this small tribute of thankfulnefs, as
well on our own behalves as on that of our kin
dred in misery and chains.
We are, fir, as you well know, though partici
pating of personal freedom, yet in very low Na
tions, claiming however, and not unworthily we
hope, to be considered as sober, and diligent find
just : with faces of colour indeed, but unknown
to the magistrate, and with names not to be
found in the lift of offenders of any kind ; vet,
lowly as we are, if, upon the queffion lately agi
tated in Parliament (involving the fate of our
whole race) we were without the fenfibi 1 it ies nt
admiration, and gratitude and hope, we should
in good truth not be men.
As concerning rhe event of this question, it
may not, perhaps, become ns to speak ; yet
ilrong an J lively is our hope, that the principles
explained, and the sensations excited by you, can
never befatisfied til] they have obtained theirend.Conscious of our humble condition, we have
considered that this paper lliould be presented
only by a few and that at your door, without
seeking any nearer access. And as towards those
gentlemen, who, like you, have been swayed by
110 other intererts than those of humanity, we
have also considered that it may be beiV to express
our acknowledgments only here, taking the li
berty however to diftinguiih, by name, Mr. Pitt
and Mr. Fox, great rivals as we are told, in poli
tical pursuits, but whom we have found to be
friends in those of virtue, seeking with one ac
cord, and with congenial minds, that better
prize which both alike can gain.
As towards you, fir, we know not what it may
become us to fay : but we mean, at lealt, by the
presentment of this paper, honor of every kind.
Our voice'is too low ro prail'e ; yet JYnall as it is,
â¢we however consider it as the firft imperfect
breathing of a name, which shall, one day, swell
the cheek of Africa, and be founded with uni
versal acclaim.
In ancient time, a great conqueror (if we are
truly informed) having ravaged Africa, and de
stroyed a whole people, made spoil even of the
name, and wore it as his own : but haply, fir, in
some future time, this name may be voluntarily
and gratefully bestowed by Africa itfelf, for na
tions preserved civilized, enlightened, and rendered
commercial, the trophy of benevolence, not the spoil oj

PORTLAND, (Mai):) July 18.
e< On Thursday the 14th inflant, at Pownalbo
rough, came 011 the trial of Louis Paronneau, a
young "Frenchman, who was indicted for the
murder of his uncle, a Mr. Joseph Junin.
" The Attorney-General, with great candoi
and fairnefs, opened the cause to the Jury, and
Hated the evidence, which he said was not pofi
tive, but depended upon a combination of cir
cumflances attending the facl. The aniount of
the evidence was, that the night preceding the
discovery of the murder, the prisoner lodged at
the house of a Mr. Dennet, having previoufh
pafled the evening thereâthat about 12 o'clock
he went out of the house, faying that he was go
ing to the (lore to bedâthat lie returned in 8 or
10 minutes, appearing terrified and agitated, and
said he saw two Indians Handing at the store
door, with guns or flicksâcried outfeveral times,
in the night that he saw Indians going to shoot
liim. 1b the morning lie went down to the store
with two young men of the house to deliver them
rumâappeared as usual, and told them to awake
liis uncle, which they refufed ; he then went in
to the bed room to awake him, reached towards
the bed, and cried out that his uncle was mur
dered. A gun was discovered in the flore room,
appearing to have been newly discharged ; but
was in a disordered slate, there being no flint, &c.
The rod of the gun was found in the kitchen ;
and the balls which had pafled through the head
of the deceased were ot the fame weight with
others found in the flore. Two mufqtiafli skins
were found near the store ; and there was evi
dence that there was a settlement of Indians at
about 10 miles distance from the flore ; one of
whom had, in Augufl last, threatened to murder
Mr. Junin, whenever he should get an opportu
nity.
" Messrs. Gardiner and Lithgow were counfcl
J"or the prisoner, and very ably pled his cause.â
The Jury brought in their verdidl that the pri
soner Was NOT GUILTY."
HUDSON, July 21.
Extratt of a letter jrom a gentleman at Frankford,
on the Kentucky river, to his. brothej- in this city,
dated May 16, I 791.
On the 19th of March we left Fort Pitt with
only 4 men, in company with two boats, to go to
Limestone. On the 22d we took in j men at
Mulkingum. The next morning, our boat being
foremoft, we were hailed by the Indians, who
came up with us in four boats, with about 20 men
in each, and killed one of our men and wounded
two the firft (hot, we waited till they were within
30 yards, and then fired, which did great execu
tion ; I then received a shot through my arm ;
one of the boats attempted to board us, but we
beat them off; they then attacked a boat in our
rear, took her, and in a mod inhuman manner
placed the women and children in the ceritcr of
their boats, and attacked lis again ; we had only
three men and myfelf able to fighr, but we beat
them off. During this attack we drifted within
yards of the (hole, where they attacked us
again, and pursued us about a mile arid a half
along the fliore, before we could get out of their
teach, Out of 9 men two only elcaped unhurt.
We had 011 board one woman and eight children,
one of the children received a flight wound. We
arrived at limeltone at it o'clock that evening.
The Indians are very troublesome in this country,
and do great mifchief; but they have not at
tacked a boat on the river since our action. The
loss they filftained from us we could not ascertain,
Lu: they fuffered leverely-for their attempt."
B IJ II L I N G T O N, July 26
A correfpondetu remarks, that the condudt of
the grand jury, im pan helled at the lad court of
oyer and terminer held here, is both exemplary
and commendable, and shews their zeal for the
public welfare in an eminent degree; for after
taking a view of the circumstances and moral
condition of the county in this vicinity, they ac
tually adjourned to Egg-Harbour, in order to en
quire more particularly on the spot, into the fate
of Capt Douglafs, and the unfortunate circum
stances attending his (hipwreck ; prompted there
to, by a suspicious report circulating, and gene
rally creditted, to the prejudice of Mr. T r,
living on the (bore. On this occasion we are au
thoriled to afl'ure the public, that, this doubtful
bulinefs having been minutely inveitigated, not
a scintilla of evidence was found that could afford
the leait foundation for the report, or cast any
suspicion on the old gentleman : on the contrary,
the paflengers and crew speak favorably of his
hospitality.
Extract of a letter from Cooper's-Town, State of New-
York, to his friend in thisccityy y dated June 30.
I have again resumed the pen, to acquaint
you with foirie of our northern occurrences ; the
firft: of which, or that which seems more particu
larly to engross our attention at this time, is our
new courts of justice, which were held in this
place for the county of Otfego, on the 21 ft inft.
The honorable William Cooper, firft judge on
the bench, from whence he delivered a decent
and spirited charge to a very refpec c iable grand
juryâthe court-house having been prex ionfly in
augurated, by a sensible and well adapted prayer
from the Rev. John Christopher Harrwickâthe
following gentlemen were then admitted coun
sellors and attornies, viz. Christopher P. Yates,
Amaziah Rust, John 1. Morgan, George Metcalfe,
James Cochran, Abraham Tenbroeck, Andrew
Wimple, Anthony Mai vine, and Jacob G. Fonda,
Â£fq*rs. all men of refpeiftability, and (the two
firft excepted) young adventurers like myfelf.â
The court was conducted with the mm oft regu
larity and decorum, and but indi&ments
found. We were favored with the company of
Mr. Rutherford, one of the senators of the United
States, who was on a visit to his friends in this
county, and like most other ftaangers, seemed
pleased with the fituarion of our town, which, 1
a(Ture you, is become quite a genteel place."
Philadelphia, August 5.
Monday being the anniversary of the birth-day of his Excellency

The latest Britifli accounts at Cadiz, on the gth June, mention,
lhat the impress service was going on with vigour, and no certainty
of any accommodation likely to take place between the Ruffians
and the Porte; but every thing looked like widening the breach
between Britain and Ruflia.
The ship Chapman, Captain Garbut, is arrived at Portland,
Cafco Bay, from Plymouth, England, and brings accounts, that
the prof peel of a war with Ruflia has very much abated, aud is
esteemed a very unpopular measure ; that a large fleet of mer
chantmen had failed for the Baltic before he came away,âand
that no American vessels were at Plymouth at the time of his
failing. [A more direst account than that from Cadiz.)
We hear from Londonderry, that the bridge built over Lough
Foyle, or Londonderry river, by Mr. Cox, of Boston, is com

â¢ hought to be a very capital piece of architecture, comprehending
thirty-four piers. The workmen who went from America with
Mr. Cox, he has taken paflages for, in order to fend them home

The inhabitant* of the Wea, or Ouittanon, and Kickapoa
towns, upon the river Wabafh, which were the object of Gene
ral Scott's expedition, were among the inoft vindictive race of
savages inhabiting the western regions.
They have no: enly conilantly refufed the pacific invitations of
the United States, but they have carried on the moll fuccetsful
and cruel 4epredatipns cn the detencelefs frontiers.
It is to be hoped the punishment which has overtaken them,
the humane treatment of their priloners, and the mild offers of
the general government llii) held forth to them, and within their
reach, will incline them, and all their neighbours, to peace.
But, should they still perfifl in their hollilities, they will pro
bably be removed from their fuuation on the Wabafh, if not
utterly extirpated ; for the general government will not fuffer the
inuocent women and children of the frontiers to be facrifiied to
indian barbarity, with impunity.
Good Government is to the body politic, what discipline is to
individualsâin a slate of nature, the materials of which mem
bers of civilized society maybe formed, are unconne&ed with
those numerous inveterate prejudices, and falfe ideas of happiness,
which are inseparably attendant on a voluptuous and vicious iiate
of civilization, âa government therefore which will probably be
competent to forming the social habits and manners of men in a
savage slate, should be simple in its conflru&ion, and plain in all
its applications to their exigencies. Bat when a Conflitution of
Government is contemplated for a people who have long been in
a civilized situation, whose affairs are become involved and per
plexedâwhose habits and manners are corrupted and difiipated,
who entertain falle ideas of charaflerâare impatient of all re
flraint. and confound liberty with licentiousnessâwhose taste
is vitiated, whose emulation is guided by a vain ambition, and a
fondnefs for diftin&ions founded on falfe principles, the work ot
government becomes arduous and difficult in the higljefl degreeâ
in such a slate of things all ideas of discipline will be spurned at
till the diseases of the public mind become inveterateâa fyflem
of government which shall answer any salutary purpose in such
circumstances, mufl possess a tone of energy and efficiency, which
mankind will very seldom submit to voluntarilyâand this I take
to be the origin of Tyrannyâfor focietv cannot exifl without
government, either free or arbitrary. Hiflory ani experience
unitedly proclaim that.discipline alone can preserve freedomâa
discipline which is the genuiue effect of a firm government; for
we may just as reasonably expcÂ£l that a total negleÂ£l of fchoo!
discipline will produce a wife, virtuous and intrepid riling gene
ration, as that a relaxed system of things which fuffers everv man
to whatever is right in his own eyes, will produce virtuous
citizens, and perpetuate freedom.
SKETCH OF MR. HASTINGS's TRIAL.
Monday the 23d of May, the trial of Mr. Hastings recommcnc
ed in Weltminfter Hall.
Mr. St. John opened the fourth article of the charge relative to
contracts, agencics, and exorbitant allowances* corruptly and il
legally given tÂ° various persons.âMr. St. John summed up the
lols to the company by these a&s, forming a total of 584,3811.
This charge was enforced by the manager, by a very clear and
elegant opening of the facts on which it was founded.
Mr. Hastings, as soon as Mr. St, John had concluded, addrefT
cd the court with an uncommon folcmnityâhe complained that
he was compelled to hear the most virulent language without be
ing allowed to offer a reply ; âhis trial had lasted four years, and
he was convinced 111 his own mind, that it would never have an
endâThe changes by creation or demise affeÂ£ling the identity of
his judges, were not less than 60,âhe could not but feel it an
liardfhip to be tried by one generation, and have judgment paflfed
by-another. He concluded his speech, by praying that the court
may continue the lefTlon from day to day, until he may be heard
in his defence, and the trial be brought to a final decision.
To this speech Mr. Burke and Mr. Fox fenarateiy replied, with
pointed severityâthe former charged him with reversing his situ
ation, and dilating to his judges the manner in which they were
to proceed, and when the process was appwachmg to its end,
when guilt was driven to its last retreat, and the lash of justice
was about to fall on its proper object, the culprit made an appeal
to compafTion, and exclaimed " that his trial would never have
an end."âMr. Hastings complained that he had been charged
with crimes oi an atrocious nature ! âcertainly he had been so
chargedâit was the atrocious detail of tortures and murders that
drew forth the Commons of England to this accusation
Mr. Fox observed in reply to the complaint of virulent language,
that in charging high crimes and misdemeanors, he felt it his du
ty to use the proper and corresponding language ; âthe grievance
of not being allowed to answer, was the result of Mr. Hastings*
own conductâthe managers had proposed that the prisoner Ihould
have been heard on each of the charges at its conclusion ; their
Lordships had decided against that modeâhut their Lord (hips
would not have refilled that plan of proceeding, if the prisoner
had given his content, he could not therefore complain of that
which was the result of his own choice.
3ir James St. Clair Erfkine then proceeded to adduce a great
variety of documentary evidence in support of the charge; and
at lix o'clock the court adjourned to Wednesday.
CORRESPONDENTS.
MR. FENNO,
YOU will oblige at Itajl one of your conjlant readers, by remarking in
your next paper, that your resolution of avoiding religious controversies
was unfortunately formed too late; and that on the present occasion, it
would have been ailing with more equity, not to have given pUce in your
paper to the " Circular Letter," which gave occasion for the " Re
marks" of HUMANUS.
Philad. July 28, 1791
In reply te the above, the Editor wouldobferve, that there is a certain
degree of refpett due to ajj'ociated bodies, which individuals cannot claim
with proprietyâon this principle the " Circular Letter" was published.
The ttfertion of a public any ajjociated denomination what
evert we do not consider as deviating from a determination long fincc an
nounced, that we mean to avoid religious controversies.
We have received " Aurilian," but requejl to be exevjed from

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven ; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful fnuation is not surpassed, if equalled by any ; be

to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by reaion of the flats, this wharf is necefTarily extended to the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when complcat

the whole extent being about 3>4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interell of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime intercft of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all clafles of people, for
thefuccefsof this enterpri/e, together with the very great advan
