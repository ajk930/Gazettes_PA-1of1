Extract of a litter front the Hon. Ezra L'Hom m E

" \\JE have fufFered equally with you by tlie
VV severity of the drought. I have found
out one manure which, notwithstanding the dry
nefs of the season, has caused the land to pro
duce wonderfully more than any other manure
in a wer season. You will he anxious 'o know
what it is- I'll tell you.â'Tis Fifli.âThe fame
they call Mosjbuncurs in New-York. We call
them Mtnhadcn. Some call them Shad. A very
â Jong fifli, but fat.
" 1 have not time to give you the particulars,
but as there are millions of these fifhes around
Long-Jfljnd, 1 have thoughts of making it one
fubje<ft of communication to the Agricultural So
titty."
Extratt of another letter from SiMEot Dr. Witt,
Esq. Surgeon-General of the State of New-York,
to Mr. Sam. L. Mitch ill, dated Albany, May
8, 1791.
" I AM very much pleased with your idea of
keeping a Calendarium Flora;, in addition to llie
common Meteorological obfei vntions. It will at
lead enable us to make the neceflary allowances
for difference of climate, when in practical agri
culture we wish to improve from experiments
made in different places. For the want of this
knowledge for instance, we are in this place in
I'ome measure at a loss in following the practice
of Pennsylvania ; and much more so, that which
is given tis in books written for the several parts
of Europe. But before this can be done to ad
vantage, a plan must be formed for making cor
respondent observations, not only in ths State, but
it Jhould extend at leajl, throughout the Union. For
this purpose, I would choose those vegetables in
the tirlt place, vvnich bitd or blollom earlielt in
the Spring, and which are universally to be
found throughout the States. I have thought of
the Anemone, the species I believe is thaliclroides,
a plant very common throughout this Stare,grow
ing chiefly in the woods, and one of the fir ft
which makes its appearance. The Dandelion may
be another, its flowers coming out early. The
Mefpilus Nivea, (so called in Barnaul's Arbuftrum
Americanum) the excellent or vjild-fervice
tree, is very common in this State at least, and
one of the earlielt blofl'omers we fee in the woods :
the banks of the Hudson from hence to New-
York, are now white with them ; with us they
are in much greater plenty than the Cornus Flo
rida, or Dog-wood ; this, 1 think, would be ano
ther proper vegetable to place particular depen
dence upon ; âbefides which, there ought to be
remarks made on exotics, particularly fruit-trees.
By carrying into effet f t a plan like this, it is pro
bable foinething new, and more ufeful than has
been usually done by Agricultural Societies might be
flruck out, and an endeavour made to obtain the co
operation of the Societies of that description in the o
ther States."
[Gardeners ami Farmers will undpubredly be
benefited by attention to the above remarks, for
instead of regulating their planting and sowing
by the day of the mouth found in the Almanacks,
they will be guided by the unerring phenomena
ot the fealon itfelf ; 'tis well known that the ve
getation of Spring is in some years fix or eight
weeks more backward than in others, whereby
the husbandmen who go to work by the day of
the month, rather than by the (late of the wea
'her, commit egregious mistakes. How much
better is it for inltance, to fi>Tv fax -when Peach
trees are in blojfom, than to flick to the old method of
putting the feed into the ground 6>i the firjl of April,
he the feafoti as it may. How much more intelli
gible to strangers and foreigners, to read in the
atfts of Agricultural Societies, that Cabbage-plants
Jhould be fct far ivi/iter eating, when cherries turn
read, rather thar. on the twenty-sixth day cf June !
&c. A register made on Mr. De Witt's plan,
voold be Co advantageous, that it is earnellly to
be desired !he several Agricultural Societies on
the continent may adopt it."] /
The capital town of Cape-Fraacoi', which by
the late accounts was in imminent danger of de

discernment to anl'wer rite many beneficial pur
poses intended. It may justly be quefHoned.
whether there is a bank in any country so well
calculated to promote the inrereitof the commu
nity. It will increase the revenue, and facilitate
the collection of it ; it will throw into circula
tion from time to time as much money as the
neceflary trade and buiioefs of the people may
require ; by these meat's it will be the general
regulation of money, and while ir moves a thou
land wheels of indtittry i: will check any excess
in the circulating medium. The wisdom of go
vernment, will aid the body of DireiSors, in the
wife management of this great source of national
and individual wealth. As one fifth of the bank
is owned by the public, it will constantly engage
the moll discerning eye of government; and as
twenty-five Directors are annually to be eletfled
by the llockholdei s, to watch over and preserve
its bell interefl, no inilitution can be better
guarded or have a clearer profpetfl: of exrenfive
ufefolnefs. During its prugrefs while the in
ilitution was forming, every possible circuinftane
unfavorable was suggested, which learned in
genuity could invent j but the more it has been
considered the more it has been admired. As
the Stockholders will soon meet for the choice
of Directors, the time draws near for the com
mencement of its operations. It being highly
intereiling to thegovernment, and to the people
in general, in particular the Stockholders, to
have the bank commence its loans as soon as pos
sible, the wisdom and energy of the Directors,
will make every effort i'or this purpose. And as
the business of banks is now so well underllood,
and this great national objedl has been folong in
contemplation, we may suppose the Directors
will commence its operations early in December.
Congress will commence their next felfion
with a profpe<ft so grateful and under circuin-
Uauces so animating, they may proceed with fa
cility and pleasure to complete the bulinefs of
thie Union. The President, and the Congress,
may jnlHy be considered as the molt fortunate
and iuccefsful legislators and rulers that ever go

prosper in their hands, and the world be illumi

IT is of infinite importance to the welfare of the
Americans, that their exports heal ways at lealt
equal to their importsâOn this balance will for
ever depend innumerable advantages. To this
capital point the government will attend with all
its wisdom : For so long as the balance is in fa
vor of the country, (considering its natural fnpe
riority, and valt agriculture) it nmfl flourifh far
beyond all former experience. The increaling
emigrations from Europe may aid the balance of
money ; but the exports and the imports are the
sure criterion to determine how the balance falls.
It is neceflary to the landed interest, and to the
manufactures, that the rateof interest for money
should be low, and this can never happen until
the funded debts are fold as high as they are 111
England. So long as four per cent, can be re
ceived for money in the public funds, individuals
will nor easily obtain loans under fix per cent.â
which is tnuch more than the profits of land or
manufactures will allow. Therefore the govern
ment, and all men of patriotism and influence,
must unite their constant exertions to raise the
value of the funds, as the only means to lower
the rate of interell. This circumstance seems not
to have been attended to in time part, and the
state of the finances did not permit a proper re
gulation ; but the revenue is now amply fufficient
to raise the credit of this country immediately to
fhat of England ; and as the general profperiry
â¢To eminently depends upon it, the utmofl energy
of government will undoubtedly be directed to
this g r eat object. It is well known that mere
fuperfluities colt this country a great sum ; if by
the wisdom of government, and the aiding ex
ample of the rulers, and the rich, the importa
tion of these fuperfluities might be discouraged,
a large balance of money would annually be left
to carry on manufactures, and hasten the reduc

IT is said, that Mr. Faulkner has.fully execut

understanding which long subsisted between our
court and that of Peterfbnrg is perfectly re-efta

renewal of the commercial treaty, which expired
in 1786, and by which both countries were so
much benefited.
By a letter from Peterfburgh we are informed,
that the Empress of Ruifia is at the lad extremi

features are too ltrong, and her "air too maCou

" A report having been circulated of an in

taken against such a mejifure ; the guards about
the Royal person have been doubled, and addi

here under a strong guard ; but as no particulars
can be developed, it is supposed to be a falfe a

M. de ViÃ'tnghoff, at Paris,
M. DE VICTI NGHOFF,
I HAVE been very much flattered by receiving,
after an absence of thirty years, fnch an affedh
onate tettimony of your sentiments as that af
forded by your letter of the 4th of June last.
The active and honorable part which you have
taken in the revolution in France, is related in
a paper which has been, for some timepaft, COI 'T
ftantly brought to me. The fame humane and
civic motives, that have governed your condudfc
in the country, which you inhabit, induce you
to take a part so agreeable to me in the revolu
tion in Poland.
The success of the latter can never be more
pleasing to me, than when I find it approved by
thole whose merit has long commanded my P ar "
ticular elteeiH. My mod sincere thanks are due
to you for the fentimeuts you express upon an
event, that protnifes to Poland a more happy a n "
secure exigence for the future.
I am very happy, fir, to have found this op
portunity of alluring you of the conllancy of that
friendfhip which was formed, when I had the
happiness of knowing you.

A letter of a lace date, from a gentleman on

and his property became a prey to his own slaves.
Numbers of people are fufferers, unfortunately

and confufion, that the trade is almost at a stand."
HARTFORD, October 3
The woolen manufacture in Hartford, after
ftruwling with every obstacle, begins to flou
rifh'and bids fair to be advantageous to the pro
prietors as well as to the public. The quality of
the cloths,more especially the coarser, is acknow
ledged on all hands to be superior to that of the
EiMilh of the fame finenefs*. It is an undeni
able fad; that the coatings made here, are more
durable than the English. The great objection
formerly made to the colouring and finifhing the
cloths is now removedâit being agreed by the
best judges that the difference between the belt
finifhed English cloths and those of this manufac
ture are hardly perceivable. And the writer of
this paragraph, a few days ago, saw a tayiormif
take cloth from the Hartford manufactory for
English. This being the fa<ft, the reputation of
American cloths will rife and facilitate the sale,
especially as they can be afforded as low as En
glish cloths of the far.ie finenefs.
As this manufacture consumes large quantities
of wool, it is recommended to our farmers to at
tend to the raising of ilieep and also to the im
proving of the breed. Wool will always be in
demand, and command cafli.
The bell foundery, by Mr. Doolittle, also de
serves notice. The bells cafl at this foundery are
equal in quality to any imported ; and the whole
continent may be furnifhed at this single foun
dery.
* However (ingular this may be thought, it is undoubtedly a
fa& ; as is well known to those who have either examined their
refpeÂ£Hve textures and materials, or have experienced the durabi
lity of each.
Philadelphia, O&ober 12.
EngtWh papers by the last arrivals, contain the
following accounts in addition to those in our
last, viz. That the plague rages in the Moreaâ
and continues to spread in Constantinople and
the neighboring villages. A second decree has
been publilhed in Spain relative to ft rangersâ
this enjoins that all strangers who dwell in Spain
must be Catholicsârenounce all privileges as
foreigners, and take an oath of fidelity to reli
gion and the sovereign, under penalty of being
sentenced to the gallies, &c.
The prospeCt of peace continues to brighten,
and some great fucceiles gained by the Ruffians
render the event 110 longer dubious ; the Em
peror it is said has already signed the articles-
Prince Repnin has defeated the Turks at Maczin
âthey loft 4000 men, 30 pieces of cannon and
fifteen ilandardsâthe Ruffians only 150 killed
and 300 wounded ; the number of the 1 urkiih
army exceeded 70,000 in en.
A sortie of 9000 men was made from Brailow,
but Prince Repnin obliged them to retire with
loss. It is expetfted that the Ruffians will now
besiege Brailow in form : Further accounts add
that the inhabitants of Brailow fearing the fate
oflfinael are fleeing from that city in great num
bers.â The Ruffians have also pofleiled them
selves of the fjrtrefs of Amafla, in the Cuban,
the whole garrison consisting of 14,000 men be
ing made prisoners of war ; the magazines, and
every thing in the place, wirh all the veflels in
the port fell into the hands of the conquerors.^
The Germanic body aflembled at Ratilbon in
'lie high Colleges of the Empire, have pas
sed sundry refulutions relative to the present si
tuations of their podeffions in Alsace and Lor
raine ; in these thev thank the Emperor for his
interposition with his Most Chriflian Majesty
they express their surprise that the answer of the
King is not in the Latin Tongue according to
treaty with France ; they fay the answer is un
latisfartory, as the French discover 110 intention
of making restitution, or even to offer an indem
nification in territory and in fubjeifts, for the
pofleffions in Alsace and Lorraine which have
been violated and infringed upon by the deciees
of the National Aflembly. 1 hey request that
the Emperor fliould make new representations
to his Most Christian Majesty on these fubjecftsâ
and, that the end may be obtained, they fut
ther resolve, That all the guarantees of the
peace of Westphalia lhall be fumuioned, with .ill
the powerful States in Europe, and be requefied
to manifeft and teftifv their participation in this
important affair, and to support tlie rcprefcnta
tions of the imperial Ambaflador at Parisâand
that the Emperor be supplicated to enjoin all the
circles and States of the Empire, duly to com
plete the numbir of their troops, so as to be able
to furni.'h their contingent in duplo, to defend
the dignity of the Germanic Empire, its autho
rity and l ights, by employing all the measures
authorised by the law of nature and nations.
N. B. The electors of Bohemia, Saxouy and
Hanover, did not accede to the aboveâand the
Elector of Brandenburg has infilled 011 prelimi
nary negotiations.
Of all the secular powers who have a fuffrnge
at the Diet of the Empire, no one has exprefied
a more unfavourable opinion of the present sys
tem of France, than the King of Sweden.
Notwithstanding the combination and resolu
tions of the Electoral College of the Germanic
Piinces againlt the proceedings of the National
Afleiiibly of France, there ai e many circumttan
ces which conlpire to prevent any acSive opera
tions againil the revolution. The financesofthe
Emperor are exhausted, and the debt of the em
pire amounts to 592 millions of florinsâadded to
this, the Emperor and the Electors cannot feel
secure in respeCt to the attachment of ihe people
to their own governments âand some of the Elec
tors are themselves so much the friends of the
Rights of Man, as secretly to with success to the
Revolution of France. The dependance of the
Emperor for money mufl be on the Kingof Spain
â and it is well known that the affairs of Spain
are not unembarrassedâand that butafmall pro
portion of the produce of the mines of Mexico
and Peru, go into the royal coffers.
In confluence of the speech which Mr. Fox
made in the House of Commons, against a war
with Russia, the Empress has diretfted her Am
baflador to procure a bull of that orator, in white
marble, which (he intends to place between those
of Cicero and Demosthenes, in her cabinet.
Succinf! flatement of the diflurhances in Hifpaniola
from the account tranfiated for the Central Ad-
vertifa\
Aucust 21. Somes negroes seized from a bo
dy of 2 or 300, being questioned relative to the
cause of their meetings, said that they wanted
to enjoy that liberty, they are intitled to by " the
Plights of Man."
22. A while man taken among several leaders
of the black insurgents j several plantations burnt.
23. Every citizen of the Cape under armsâ
all the plantations on the plain, on fire, and the
whites found on them murdered.âtwenty ne
groes killed ; their number amounts to 2000â
the troops attacked themâthey flee and are pur
sued, 35 killed and 50 wounded, many whites
among them ; the Cape regiment is joined by
the citizens, âall in consternation.
24- Intelligence the molt distressingâall is on
fireâthis is seen from the Cape ; the city put
ting icfelf in a posture of defence, a battalion of
volunteer citizens set out â600 of the insurgents
escapedâkilled 8 or joâfound the plantation
Ckoifsuil burnt âtroops returned to the Cape.
The quarter Morin is now on fire ; the
infurre&ion becomes more general, numbers of
the negroes taken, and condemned to be Ihot.
The free negroes and mulattoes armed, and are
formed into a separate division, they are eager
to attack the insurgents
26. Every avenue to the city is guardedâthe
legroes are at the distance of one league, and
frequently approach in numbers to bid us defi
ance many of them are killed by our cannon,
notwithstanding which they come up unarmedâ
a few whites belonging to the Cape have been
killed, owing to their own imprudence.
27. In several engagements the whites have
been fuccefsful ; and the negroes always driven
back with loss ; 60 or 70 men have frequently'
beat back 7 or 800 of the negroes ; they are now
10,000 strongâ7 or 800 of which are on horfc
back, and tolerably well armed.
28. Above 100 Negro prisoners have been (hot
in the burying place within two daysâOne Ne
gro, a leader, has been broken on the wheelâ
and a white leader hung ; âhe had been an Ab
be, and declared that he was sent from France
with four more, to teach the Negroes to revolt ;
there are other white rebels in prifon.âlt is said
there are at least 100 white men in the Negro
camp. About 150 whites have been murdered
on the plantations.
29. The Mulattoes and free Negroes have dis
tinguished themselves greatly, and killed many
of the insurgents.
50. The Americans fitrnifh a guard every
nightâalso the French sailors.
31. Some indications of a conspiracy ;â it ap
pears that the plot is to set fire to the city in 400
houses at onceâto butcher the whites, and take
the city by escalade.âM de Rouvray the com
manderin chief of the whites, has killed 290 in
one engagement âWe have loft M. Lehon the
commander of the JVlulattoes.
This Journal is continued to the 13th Septem
berâin which there is a detail of the attacks
made on the Negroes from day today, generally
191-
with success. TheONcgroes were however fonie
times victoriousâthey have taken foine of the
whites prisonersâand 011 the jth September, the
account Hates that they had taken a fort in which
were fix 24 pounders. The Negroes have seve
ral field-pieces in their camp on the Heighths of
the Cape. The infurredtion, so far from being
quelled, appears to have encreafed.
A chief of the insurgents, named Cappe, was
taken and broke on the wheelâhe was peflefled
of an income of 30,000 livres, all in town houses.
The number of Negroes killed to the 13111 Sept.
is supposed to be upwards of 3,000 âand before
the iiTurrediion is quelled, it is judged that x or
2,000 more muff be aifpatched.
A letter from Cape Francois of the 18th Sep
tember, received here on Monday, fays that no.
tiling of importance had been done towards quel
ling the dilturbances, nor had any thing further
happened to encreafe the evil. A sortie of 2,000
whites was to take place on the 19th.

A plan for cutting a Canal, between Clubfoot's

from Creek to Creek is about two milesâThus
the spirit of improvement is catching from State

Ratifications of the articles of amendment to the Constitution of
the United States proposed to the States by the firft Congress un

Maryland, North-Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode-Island and
South-Carolina, have ratified the wholeâDelaware has postponed
a decision on the firft article, which was lately ratified by Penn
sylvaniaâ New-I-lampfhire, New-York and New-Jersey, have ra

have not been received by Congress.
Eulogium on the Conjlitvtion of the United States, j rem Dr. Linn's
Sermon, 4th July,
AS far as this Constitution has been tried, its influence is
found to be fafeand beneficial. It is a representation ot the peo
ple, from whom all legitimate government is derived. It is a go
vernment of laws, not of men. It ptomHVs to unite mildness and
energy ; to lecure and defend ; to fleer the happy medium be
tween oppreflion and licentioufncfs.
It is calculated to encourage genius, and bring merit to view
from the oblcure walks of life. Titles and birth give no claim to
rank or precedence; but a capacity for business, with learning,
eloquence and virtue, are the fuieft ways to rife to honor aud pit
ferment.

Captain Hooper left Bilboa the 9th Augufi J a 11, and brings th
allowing intelligenceâThat during his (lay at Bilboa, feveralvef
fels arrived there from Gicat-Britain, all agreed uniformly in ihÂ»
following particularsâ That the courts of Great Britain and Spain
had combined together to make war on France, tor the purpoie of
compelling her to reinflate the French monarch on his throneâ
That a hotter press was never knownâAnd every other prepara*
tion for war, which was universally believed would be declared in
form. Capt. Hooper on his outward paflage, in the bay of Bis
cay, spoke two Spanish frigates, two armed brigs, and one large
transport ship, (the latter of which was full of soldiers) from Cadiz,
bound to St. Sebaflian. The principal merchants, as well as every
other rank of the people of Bilboa, had no doubt but that a war
was inevitable.

Archbilhop of Paris would not allow his body to
be inhumed in consecrated ground, which the
King being informed of, sent for the Archbilhop,
and expoftnlated with him ; but he was an ob
ilinate churchman, and would not willingly con
descend to his Majesty's perfuaiions. The King,
finding him unwilling to comply, desired to know
how many feet deep the Holy Ground reached !
The Bifliop replied, " about eight." " Well,"
replied the King. " I find there is 110 getting the
better of your scruples ; therefore let his grave
be dug twelve feet, that is four below your con
secrated ground, and let them bury him there."
The Archbifliop was obliged to comply ; for Louis
