permitted us to place our batteries

command the enemies line, while
ours was flieltered from their can

under the flicker of this natural pa

had exposed him to be ill received in bis own

them all his life- After this conversation,
the truth of which I guarantee to you, the
two French princes went to the castle of

The conduct of thele two battalions Mau
confeil and Republican, was explained in a
letter from General Cliazot ? commanding at-
Rhete!. Four Pruflian delerters had been ta
ken prisoners, who, according to the report
of the municipality, were desirous of entering
into the service of the Republic. These two
battalions fell upon them in the inoft inhuman
manner,and notwithstanding thetears and fup
pi'cations of their own General, like ruffians
and butchers, cut them in pieces. The or
ders of General Dumourier were, that these
two battalions should be surrounded by the
army, and forced to lay down their arm?,
standards and uniforms. That they should be
forced to deliver up the criminal? who com
mitted the inhuman mafTace at Rhetel, who,
under an escort of iod men, should conduct
tUem to Paris, and deliver them up to the
National Convention. That the reft of the
battalions should be brokenâtheir arms and
' abits laid up in tne military store, and their
colours sent back to their diftrifis, to be by
them confided to men more worthv to bear
them. This ineafure was highly applauded by
the Convention.
A 1-Tter from General Cuftine was read,
dating, that he had imposed upon tie Canons
and Bishop of Swires, who were great friends'*
to the Emigrants, a contribution of 450,003
livres.

ij'ere drawn up only two men deep, while
the French adÂ»anced in columns, their loss
must liave beets considerable. At three
o'efcek the garrison retired to tlie town
thraigh the different gates, and the firing
was continued in the streets with fomuch
vivacity, that the infantry of Mayence
eigh; times repulsed the French cavaW.
Notvithftanding this brave reliftance, our
troop were obliged to give way before
the eiertiy, who were mucl) superior in
nnmter, and to retire through the gate
calli'J Weifethor, towards the ford of
Rhrinhoufe, at about the distance of a
league from Spires. The French pursued
them thither with their whole forces, and
thc7 were then reduced to the neeeffity of
asking leave to capitulate. After a delay
of firty minutes, lieut. colonels Dietrich
and Fechenbacn; the former in the fe. -
vice of Auilria, and the letter ia that of
the Elector of Mentz, agreei wlÃi M.
Cuftine, the French general, that the
garrison should remain pri Toners of war ;
that the artillery, arms i s ar.. Lag
gage mould be given up to the enemy ;
that the officers should be fuffered to re
tain their atms, horfcs and effe&s ; and
that the soldiers should not be stripped.
After these stipulations were agreed to,
the garrison was brought back, to the
town, where the soldiers laid down their
arms close to the grand guard, and were
afterwards lodged in the Cathedral, but
the officers had permiflian to walk about.
" Next morning, October ift, all the
privates, reckoning from the firft ferjeant
of each company, were conveyed to
Landau, and a declaration was made to
the officers atkmbled at tlie Hoce!-de-
Vilk, that they would be set at liberty
after they had taken an Â«,ath not to serve
ih the war against the French tilt an ex
c, of prifi.ners should placeââ¢
having acquiesced in this proposal, and
fold their horses for ready money to the
French, the commandant of Landau con
duced them without any guard to the
ford of Rhein-houfe, and permitted them
to retire wherever they might think pro-
per.
One of the Secretaries proclaimed the
qames of the members who arc to com

These were Seyes, Thomas Paine,Petion,

the contrary, few or none flocked to their
standard i They were promised fuppiies of
provisions from France, and depending upon
them, they were for fomc time in a flarving
condition. The Pruffiau magazines have
been exhaufled, and provilions carried to the
invading armies proved so unwholfome, that
sickness anddifeafe were the consequences of
using them. Theft added to inceflant rains
for many weeks, were the immediate causes
of the retreat. The French army under the

their soldiers, and large quantities of baggage
