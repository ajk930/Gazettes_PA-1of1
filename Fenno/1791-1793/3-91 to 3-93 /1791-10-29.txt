ANSWER of M. SYEYES,
To Mr. Paine's Letter, and to several other fublt-
cations of a similar nature.
MR. THOMAS PAINE is one of those men who have con
tributed the mod to cllablilh the liberty of America. Hr
ardent love of humanity, and his hatred of every fort of tyranny,
have indnced him to take tip in England [he defence of (he French
revolution, againll the amphigorical declamation of Mr. Burke.
His work has been trariflated into our language, under the title of
" Des Droits di l'Homme," and is univcrlally known.
What French Patriot is there, who has not already, from the
bottom of his heart, thanked this foreigner for having ftrength
enrd our cause byall the powers of his reason and reputation ? It
jt with pleasure that" I obfet ve an opportunity of offering him the
tribute of my gratitude and niy cfteem for the truly philosophical
application of talents so diflinguilhed as his own.
Mr. Paine supposes that I have given him a challenge, and he
accepts it. I have not given any challenge; but I (ball be very
glad to afford to so able an author an opportunity of giving the
world some further truths.
Mr. Paine declares himfelf to be the open enemy of monarchi
cal government. I merely fay, that-a republican.iorm of govern*
mcnt appears to me to be inefficient for liberty. After an avow-
also positive on both fides, nothing seems to remain for us but to
7>roduee our proofs, the public being entirely ready to decide be
tween us. But unfortunately abftraÂ£l quefhons, those especially
that relate to a science, the very language of which is scarcely yet
fixed, require to be prepared for investigation by a fort of preli
minary convention. Before we begin a contest, to be carried on
at lead under the standard of philosophy, it is absolutely ncceflary
that we fbould be underOood. Mr. Paine is so conscious of this
that he begins by giving definitions. "J do not undcr
ftanrl," favs he, " by republicanism, that which beais the name
in Holland, and in some Hates of Italy."
When he wrote thus, the author was, no doubt, aware, that I,
on my part, do not undertake to defend either the Ottoman, or
the monarchy. In order to be reasonable in this dif
cuflion, and certainly we both desire to be so, we ought to begin
by reje&ing all examples. In point of social order, Mr. Paine
cannot be less pleased than I am with the models which history
offers us. The question between us then depends upon fnnple
theory. Mr. Paine defends his republic, such as he underllands
it; I defend monarchy, as I have conceived it
" In short," fays Mr. Paine. " it is against the whole Hell
oF monarchy, that I have declared war." I intreat him to be
lieve, that in this undertaking, I would be bis second, and not his
adversary. Ido not adopt the iniereft of the whole Hell of re
publics. The one is as real a? the other, and avails jutl as much.
If is impossible thzrt either Mr. Paine or myfelf should ever take*
the part of any fort of Hell.
" Bv republicanism," fays Mr. Paine, <c I undcrftand merely
a government by representation." I have had some difficulty in
conceiving, why it (hould be endeavoured to confound two no
tions so diftinft as those of a representative system and republi
canism ; and I hope for some attention to my answer.
It is only since the event of the id of June last, that this repub
lican party has been perceived. What is their object ? Can they
be ignorant, that the plan of representation which the National
AJTembfy has piefented to France, though imperfect in some of
its parts, is, norwithftanding, the purest and the best which has ap
peared in the world ? What then is the object of those who defiie
a republic, when they define it to be (imply a government by re
presentation ? What ! does this party, so lately formed, already
endeavour to array itfelf with the honor of demanding, rcprefent
ativc administration against the National Assembly itfelf ? Will
thev feriouflv undertake to persuade men, that in all this there are
but two opinionsâthat of the republicans, who wi(h a represent
ation, and that of the National Assembly, who do not ? It is im
poflihle to imoute to M. M. the new republicans, such a chimera ;
or, that they should hope for such a blind docility on the part of
the public and poftetity.
When I speak of political representation, I go further than Mr.
Patne. I maintain that every social constitution of which repre
sentation is not the essence, is a falfe constitution. Whether a
monarchy or not, every alfociation, the members of which do not
all at once vacate their com mon administration, has but to chufe
between representatives and masters, between despotism and legi
timate government. There may be varieties in the manner of
clafling the representatives, and their internal regulations; and
lone of the different forms may be able to attribute to itfelf ex
elufively the true, essential, and diftinÂ£tive chara&er of all good
government. We are not to imitate those who favâObfcrvc, I
understand by a republic, a good government ; and by monarchy,
a bad one : take that ground, and defend yourfclf. It is not to
a man of abilities, like Mr. Paine, that it is necessary to give a
cunt ion against such language.
Whatever dispute may arise upon the different forts of repre
sentations ; however it may be enquired, for instance, whether it
is wife to employ exactly the fame method in the executive and
the lcgiflative order; or whatever other questions of this fort may
be produced, it does not at all follow, that upon these gradations
and (hades, depend the difference between republicans and mo
larcbicans.
All these debates are, or will be, common to partisans of both
â¢yftcms, and they will be equally so in either hypothesis of a good
Â° r a tad representation. In fa&, whether our established proxies
(hall be well or ill chosen, or we!! or ill established, it will remain
to be known what shall be their correlation, and how you will
"'fpofe them amonft themselves, (or thebeft distribution and great
facility of public operation.
In one word, it will still remain to be known, whether you will
kave a republic or a monarchy ; becaule, of themselves, the repub
'can and monarchic forms will apply either to a good or bad con
't'tution, to a good or bad government. It is not, therefore, the
c ara&t r of a true representation, that it mud bear the diftinguifh
attributes which maik republicans.
Here, in my opinion, are the two principal points, by which
the differrnce of the f wo fvftems are to be recognized.
Make all political a&ion, that which you please to call the exe
cutive power, center in a council of execution appointed by the
**oplc, or by the National Aflfrfpbly, and vow have tormed a tc
public, " â¢ â¢ '

FROM THE COLUMBIAN CLNTINEL.
MR. BURKE,
Has been charged with entertaining defpc.tic
principles. The charge is not however, well
founded ; as can be demotidrated by the fal
lowing extract from a pamphlet lately published
by him, intitled, " All Appeal from the new to
the old WHIGS," which the Editor received
in the last vellel From Europe. The indignation
which has marked his public writings and speak
ing,_ it seems, was whollj excited bj the levelling,
spirit of the F'ench Democrats ; farfpeaking of
another revolution, which has lately pafled be
fore the worldâand condemning the silence in
which it has been pafled over in England, he
fays :â
" THE STATE OF POLAND
Was undoubtedly filch, that there could scarcely
exist two opinions, but that a reformation of its
coniti tut ion, even at fohie expence of blood,
might be seen without mncli disapprobation.
No confufion could be (eared in such an enter
prize ; because the eftablifhinent to be reformed
was it lei f a Hate of confufion. A King without
authority ; Nobles without union or subordina
tion ; a People without arts, industry, commerce,
or liberty ; no order within ; no defence with
out ; no effective public force, but a foreign
force, which entered a naked country at will,
I and disposed of every thing at pleasure. Here
was a (fate of things which seemed to invite and
might perhaps jufiify bold enterprize and despe
rate experiment" But in what manner was this
chaos brought into order ? The means were as
(hiking to the imagination, as fatisfactory to the
reason, and soothing to the moral fentinient.
In contemplating that change, humanity has eve
ry thing to rejoice and to glory in ; nothing to
be ashamed of, nothing to fuffer. So far as it
has gone, it probably is the moil pure and de
fecated public good which ever has been confer
red on mankind. We have seen anarchy and
servitude at one removed ; a throne strengthen
ed for the protection of the people, without
trenching on their liberties ; all foreign cabal
banilhed, by changing the crown from eleiftive
to hereditary ; and what was a matter of pleas
ing wonder, we have seen a reigning King, from
an heroick love to his country, exerting himfelf
with all the toil, the dexterity, the management,
and intrigue, in favor of a family of strangers,
with which ambitious nien labour for the aggran
disement of their own, Ten millions of men in
a way of being freed gradually, and therefore
fafely to theinielves and the (late, not from civil
or political chains, which, bad as they are, only
fetter the mind, but from , substantial personal
bondage. Inhabitants of cities, before withjut
privileges, placed in the consideration which be
longs to that improved and connedted lunation
of facial life. One of the moll proud, numerous,
and fierce bodies of nobility and gentry ever
known in the world, arranged only in the fare
iiioft rank of free and generous citizens. Not
one mar. incurred loss, or fuffered degradation.
All, from the King to the day-labourer, were im
proved in their condition. Every thing was kept
in its place and order ; but in that place and or
der every thing was bettered. To add to this
happy wonder (this unlieard-of conjunction of
wifdoin and fortune) not one drop of blood was
spilled ; 110 treachery ; no outrage ; no system
of (lander more cruel than the sword ; 110 ft udied
insults on religion, morals, or manners ; no
spoil ; no confiscation ; no citizen beggared ;
none imprisoned ; none exiled : the whole was
effected with a policy, a discretion, an unanimity
and secrecy, such as have never been before
known 011 any occasion ; but such wonderful
conduct; was reserved far this glorious conspiracy
in favour of the true and genuine rights and in
terefi sos men. Happy people, if they know to
proceed as they have begun ! Happy Prince,
worthy to begin with splendor, or to close with
"lory, a race of patriot Kings : and to leave,
A name, which every wind to hcav'n would bear,
Whirl) Jieo to tell, and Aojeli joy to hear.

the circular waves to be fniall, and iflbe only to
a little distance from the centre. If" we drop ano

multiplied force, the surrounding waves swell
to a superior size, and extend to a more distant
space.âThe mind, unimproved by letters or con
vention, deals in trifles, is hemmed in by itfelf
and extends not far from its own centre ; while
he, who is enlightened by education, whose ideas
are improved by ftndy, rises to a more elevated
height, and takes in a more extensive compass.
THE conversations of the lower class rife from
themselves, and terminate where they rife. Their
observations seldom extend to men or things â¢
they deal in the little; keep near their own
centre ; are heroes of their own story : and bla

ihemfelves.

Extratt of a letter from Stockholm, Aug. 17.
" On the King's arrival here, he went to thi
French play-house, accompanied by several ofR
cers of that nation. Enemies to that great revo
lution which has taken place in their country
they.came to Stockholm, either to seek an afyluro
in this land of despotism, or to solicit the defpoi
to give the means to restore to their King,
the Nobility and the Clergy, the arbitrary rights
which were a cui fe to the French Nation. Tliefe
officers labor under a great error, if ihey imagine
that Guflavus will take the lead step in favor of
the Nobility and Clergy of France.âA Fi ince
whole principal object in ilictwolafl revolutions
of Sweden, had been to crnfh those two bodies
who lay so heavy, not only upon the nation, but
upon the Royal authority. If, then, Guftavus
attempts ,to bring on a counter-revolution, it
would be solely in favor of the despotism of the
French Monarch ; and all those who know his
charader, are confident that in cafe of success
he would advise Louis the 16th to fetter all-
People, Clergy, and Nobility.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

MR. SEDGWICK, Mr. Macon, and Mr. Vena
ble, took :lieir feats this clay.
The committee appointed to draft rules and
regulations for the House, reported progress.
It was moved that the rules of the former
House fljould be adopted pro tempore. This was
objected to by foine of the new members who
were unacquainted with ihofe rules. The rules
were read for information, aud then the uiotiou
was carried

Older of the day.
In committee of the whole, on the President's
Speech.
Mr. Muhlenberg in the Chair,
The addi ess being read, Mr. Vr king moved a
resolution, of which the following is ihe purport,
" Resolved, That it is the opinion of this com
mittee, that an address should be prelented to
tlie President of the United States, by the House
of Representatives in answer to his speech, to
congratulate liim on the prosperous lltuation of
the United States ;â.expreftive of the approbation
of the House of the wife and prudent ineafures
he has pursued during their recess, in the exe
cution of tlie duties committed to his charge;
promising speedy attention to the important and
momentous objetSs recommended to their con
sideration, and expreifing their approbation of
the humane and effectual steps taken, under his di
rection, for the defence of theWeltern frontiers."
This rel'olution was objected to by Mell'rs. Law
ranceand Sedgwick,Smith (S. C.) and Livermore,
upon the principle, that it exprelfed the sense of
the House npon points which requited further
information and inveltigation before the House
could, with propriety, determine. It was diffi
cult to fay, before proper documents were laid
before the Ho lift; whether the ineafures adopt
ed for the defence of the weltern frontiers were
the molt prudent that could be adopted. It was
impossible, positively to allert, that the Prefidein
in the execution of the duties assigned him in
carrying into elFect the Excise acft, had done all
for the bell. Every member that spoke agreed
in expreffiug his individual opinion, that no doubt
the President had acted with his wonted pru
dence and wisdom in the execution of the trusts
reposed in him ; but alio agreed that it was im
proper, indeed it was no compliment paid to the
President, to approve before a formal examination.
In anlvver to these objections it was observed,
that so far as circum (lances had been madeknown
to the members, relative to the lteps taken by
the Prefidetit during the recets of the Federal
Legislature so far they claimed the approbation
of the House, and that the opinion of the House
was only meant to be given as far as they were
informed. It was urged, that the answer of the
House ftiould be a candid expreflion of their feel
ings ; feelings which rhe prosperous lituation of
the country undoubtedly called forth, and which
the illue of the measures adopted coald not fail
to excite.
Seveial modifications were proposed to the re
solution, which was finally agreed to, in Cub
nance as follows, viz. Â« Resolved, That an an
swer be returned to the President's address, con
taining allurances of f'peedy atrentioti to the im
portant objecfts-rccom mended to the confidera
uon of the Legislature." Thus modified the .e
(outturn was reported to and adopted by the
A memorial was presented from the diftilleri
111 the town of Bolton and vicinity, complaining
of the unequal operation of the excise law, and
fuggelting alterations therein.
A memorial was read from the Sheriff of Suf
folk County, Matlachufects refyeding pril'onen
of the United States.
. A resolution was adopted, directing the Cleik
to cause three of the city newspapers, at the elec
tion of the refpediive members, to be left at t heir
lodgings. Mr. Giles piefented a petition from
Mr. William Witlock of the town of Peterfoui;-
( Virginia) whicn was referred to the Secretary
of the Treasury.
The following members were appointed a coir
mittee to examine the credentials of persons re.
turned as members of the House, viz. Me firs.
Livermore, Boudinot, Gerry, Gilman, Bourne
(R.) Hillhoufe and Steele.
A resolution which had been laid on the table,
contemplating the appointment of a conunitte of
contested elections was taken up-
Mr. Livermore was opposed to such an appoint
ment. The constitution, lie said, had lixed the
mode of judging contested elections, at least to
determine so far that the House should be the
judges of camelled elections of their own mem
bers. He was of opinion that the forms to be
observed in the trial should not be fixed before a
cafe of conrefted election occurred. He totally
disapproved of the idea of delegating to a com
miuee this power of judging, expressly given to
them by the Constitution. Such a transfer of
power, he conceived, would be as unconstitu
tional as to delegate a legislative authority. In
the Briiiih parliament, it was true, a committee
was made the judge of contefled elections ; but
there was no higher authority there, he obfen
ed, to prevent them from delegating this power ;
when here the people of the United States had
clearly spoken in their constitution, and deter
mined the judges of the elections.
Mr. Vining stated, that his objedt in wiflurig
the refolutionadopted, was to procure expedition,
Cave expence, and secure fairnefs of decision in
determining contested elections. He hoped the
conilitution would be 110 obstacle to tlie attain
ment ofihefe desiderata. Perhaps, he foggefted,
it might be found necessary to leave to the House
a final vote, after the work of the committee had
been laid before them.
Mr. White said he clearly saw great inconveni
ence in permitting cases of contetted elections to
come diretftly before the House. The delays ami
consequent expellee of examining witnefles before
the House, he itated, would be very great. He
was of opinion that a committee appointed for
that purpose should examine the evidences bro't
forward, arrange them, and lay them in order
before the House for theirinformation ; but then
he infilled, 011 the necessity of letting the deter
mination depend upon a vote of the House.
The House adjourned without taking a qnelli
-011 011 the resolution, until to-morrow, 11 o'clock.
THURSDAY, October 27.
The Speaker communicated a letter from the Secretary of the
Library Company of Philadelphia, enclosing sundry resolutions

vered the following Addrrfs,in answer to his Speech to both Houses
at the opening of the Seifion : â
Si R,
I\ T receiving your addrefsat the opening of the present feflion.
the House of Rcprefentatives'have taken an ample share in the feel
ings infpireJ by the a&ual prosperity, and flattering profpe&s of
our country : And whiltt, with becoming gratitude to heaven, we
ascribe this happtnefs to the true Iburce from which it flows, we
behold with an animating pleasure, the degree in whtch the con-
Jlitution and laws of the United States have been instrumental in
dispensing it.
It yields us particular fatisfaftion to learn the success with which
the different important measures of the government have proceed
ed; as well those specially provided for at the last feflion, as those
of preceding date. The fafcty of our Western Frontiers, in
which the lives and repose of so many of our fellow citizens are
involved, being peculiarly interesting, your co nmunications on
that fubjeft arc proportionally grateful to us. The gallantry and
good conduit of the Militia, whole feivices were called for, arc an
honorable confirmation of the efficacy of that precious icfource of
a free State. And we anxiously wish that the confluences of their
fuccefsiul enterprizes, and of the other proceedings to which you
have referred, may leave the United States free to pursue the mo if
benevolent policy towards the unhappy and deluded race of peo
ple in our neighborhood.
The ampunt of the population of the United States, determined
by ihe returns of the tenfus, is a source of the mod pleasing re
flexions, whether it be viewed in relation to our national fafcty
and refpe&ability, or as a proof of that felicity in the situation of
our country which favors so unexampled a rapidity in our growth.
Nor ought any to be infcnfible to the additional motive suggested
by this important fact, to perpetuate the tree government establish,-
cd, with a wife adminiftiation of it, to a portion of the earth
which promises such an increase of the number which is to enjoy
these bleflings within the limits of the United States.
We (hall proceed with all the rclpeft due to your patriotic re
commendations, and with a deep sense of the trust committed to
ils by our fellow citizens, to take into confideratioti the various
and important niaiteis falling within the present sessionâand in
difcufling and deciding each, we shall feel every disposition, whilst
we are pursuing the public welfare, which must be the supreme
objett with all our constituents, to accommodate as far as pofliblf,
the means of attainining it to the sentiments and wishes of cveiy
part of them.
Signed by order, and in behalf of the House of Reprefentahves,
JONATHAN TRUMBULL, Speaker.
Attefl. John Beckley, Clerk.
To which the President was pleased to make the following
Reply.
Gentlemen,
THE pleasure I derive from an aflurance of your attention to
the obje&s I have recommended to you, is doubled by your con
currence in the testimony I have borne to the prosperous condi
tion of our public affairs.
Relying on the (an&ions of your enlightened judgments and cn
your patriotic aid, I (hall be the more encouraged in all my en
deavors for the public weal; and particularly in those which may
be required on my part for executing the salutary measures I an
ticipate from your present deliberations.

inefi to his new matter, one of the workmen was
directed to shoot him : who inadvertently com
plied, the (hot patting through his neck ; which
riot proving fatal, and the Negro becoming out

SINCE by cutting of trotes all glories encrafe y
Of war let us sing, becafe why ? it brings pate ;
Of hacking and hewing in front and in tear,
Of some hilt b/ (word, and some dying through fear.
Death alive ! what sweet (laughter, and putting, and fears,
Is it honor you'd feck, and wo'n't go 1a the wart ?
When death his long scythe bathes in gore to the hilt,
And whips heads from (boulders lo clever,
And where, should you pet the good luck to be ki.'t,
By my sowl âyou'll be living forever!

ORIGINAL ADDRESS.
TO THE PUBLIC.
AT this important crilis,thc ideas that fill the mind, are prrÂ»
nam with events of the greatest magnitudeâ to ffren'gthrn and"
complete the union of ihe StÂ»trs--to extend and pioV} rheir
commerce-to explore and arrange the national'funisâin reftorr and
establish the public creditâwill require energies rtf the patriots
and sages of our conntiyâ Hence the propriety of encreajivg the m
diums of knowledge and information.
AMERICA, from this period begins her national exillenceâ
" THE WORLD is Â»u befo re he k "âthe wisdom and lollyâ
the misery and profpeiity of the empires, slates, and kingdoms, which
have had their day upon the grcal theatre of time, and are now no
more, suggest the moll important inemciitnsâihefe, with the rapid
feriei of events, in which our ceunirv has been involved*/have
taught the enlightened citizms of the United States, that freedtm
and government, liberty and laws, are inftparablc.
This conviaion led to the adoption of the new cirnftiturioht
for however various the sentiments, refpefluigthe merits of tbi>
system, all good men are agreed in the nectffity of an efficient fe
deral government.
A paper, therefore, established upon national, independent, ahd
impartial principle*âwhich shall take up the ptemifed ai tides, upoÂ»
a competent pl aN,it is presumed, will be highly iutereiling,'
and meet with public approbation and patronage.
The Editor of this publication is determined to lÂ£ave no avenue
of information unexplored He solicits the assistance of perfsna
of leisure and abilitiesâwhich, united with his own afliduity, he
flatters himfelf will render the Gazette of the United States not un
worthy general encouragement-' and is, with due refped, the

April 15,1789,
POSTSCRIPT.
THE plan and execution of the Gazette of the Unite*
States, have received the approbation of a tribunal, from which
there is no appeal.
The fubferiptions, which arc encfeafing, have long ftnee exceed
ed the expectations of the oublifherâa punctual compliance with
the terms would compensate his labours, and animate his future
exertions.
The Government that an enlightened and free people adopt, if
a sacred confederationâit knows no its prosperity is
founded on the public good.
While the people are just *.o themselves, the administration of
their affairs will be committed to men of integrity and competent
abilities; and it will be the duty of patnotifm to impress the pub
lic mind with favorable fentimcnts of the meaiuie's of govern
ment.
Our country continuing enlightened and free, the period can
not be anticipated when a publication on the plan of this Gazette
shall involve a dereliction ol those principles with which the li
oerties and hanpinefs of the United States are connected.
With refprCt to the circulation of this paper, the Editor regrets
the recent difa}>pointmcnts which have unavoidably tak.cn placcâ
he has always been fultyTmprefrcd with the importance of punc
tuality, and cannot charge himfeif with a ftncle lultance of re
mi fTncfs.
It is very generally fyppofed that Congress, at the ensuing
fcfljon, will take measures to ensure the circulation of news
papers in the United States; and particularly their tranfmiflion
irom the Seat ol Government to all partsof the Union. Jultice,
policy and patriotifin, plead irrcfiflably in favor of some effectual
provision's being made. The following pertinent and judicious,
observations on this fubjeÂ£t, lately appeared in an address to the
public from the Editor of the Gazetteof Maine. They
are fubflituted in preference to any thing which the editor of this
paper might further furjgeft, more particularly as coining from a
remote quarter of the Union.
" Perhaps there is no country, in any part of the world, the in
habitants of which are, (or may be) supplied with public News
papers at a cheaper rate than those of Amciica. The Farmer and
the Merchant* the Laborer and the Mechanic, may, by the means
of a public Paper, when he retires frprn the business Â«ind fatitjufi
of the day, take a view ol the Atuation, the circumfiances and the
various revolutions of the several countries of the civilized worldâ
And it mull be a pleasing circumstance, that this is the privilege*
emphatically the privilege of an American.
" Let it therefore be remembered, that by virtue of this privi
lf *ge, the body of the people conflantly obtain and preserve such a
degree of knowledge as (hall be competent to the prevention ot
any attempt that may be made by cunning and deftgn:ng men to
sap the foundation of our mofl invaluable confutation. But, let
the circulation ol these Vehicles of Public Information be circum
scribed, and the people will at once become uninformed of public
tranfattions, and the more enlightened few will engrofsthe privi
leges, immunities and prerogatives, which in the nature and fimefs
of tilings, are the indcfeafible light of the whole body of the
people.
" It is prcfumcd no American will need a stimulus of this na
ture to furnifh hinifcU with public iniormation. The cheap ra e
at which it is olFered, the love and glory of our country, will
all times promote such a mode of condu&, as fhdll toreverbar the
attempts of tyranny, ignorance and fupciftition."
