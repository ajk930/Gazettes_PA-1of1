in or about the month of March, 1780, and failed
from thence in the said month of March, or in the
month of April following, to some portor place in
America, but to what port or place is not known ;
and that in the Month of May, 1780, the said ship
or velfel was ffen at Barbadoes, in the Weft-In
dies, but the said Henry Webb hath not since been
heafd of, and is supposed to be dead, it having
been reported that the Tender belonging to the
said fhtp orvelfel called the Vengeance, which
fhio was then commanded by Captain Knowles,
with a number of her meo, to the amount of 20,
or thereabout (and among whom the laid Henry

,: 8 L ISHED FROM THE FEDERAL GAZETTE
To the DIRECTORS and COMPANY of the
Si'squ eh an nah and SchuylkiLl Canal,
or Inland Navigation.
Gentlemen,
THE inland navigation of this state being of
the greatcft public utility, and having of latc|
drawn ihe attention of the legislature, as well as ol
the citizens in general thereto, as to a fubjett of
immense magnitude, some observations on it may
be necePary and ufeful at this time.
I. The immenje advantages of the objett absorb every
idea oj otjettion anjivg Jrom the expevce of it, the
only mailer of felicitous enquiry is the pra&icabi
iity of it. An inland navigation between Schuyl
kill and Sufquehannah, will bring by water to Phi
ladelphia all the trade of the extensive waters of
Sufquehcnnah and ol a ranft fertile country of about
one thouland fquars miles, or 6,000,00 c acres of
land.
But this is not allâif this can be accompli died,
a further extenfton of the inland navigation may be
talily nlade to the Ohio and to Lake Erie, which
at once opens a communication with above 2000
miles extent of western country, viz. with all the
Great Lakes, together with all the countries which
! 'â  on, the wa-ets of MiiTiflipppi, Milourt ami all
1 heir branches; an object valt indeed, and far
greater than any one of a like kind which can be
produced in any other country on earth.
11. The water communication between Schuyl
kill and Sufquehannah is the foul of all this, or at
least js the Great Sine qua rion of it all; for were
011 the proposed water communications weft ot
Sufquehannah compleated, but mull flop at Sufque
hannah, or could the communication with the fia
be made in any other way than the on* piopofed,
'tis manifeft that the whole advantages of thnt
immense trade would be in a manner 101 lto this
city, and would go to some of our neighbors, and
aggrandize them fir beyond every power of com
petition which would be left for us.
(ep Bvv )
111. This water communication between
Schuylkill and Sufquehannah mull be formed over
a trail of country, of about 40 miles extent from
river to river on a firaight line, but about 60 miles
as the navigation mull go ; this trail is cut by two
creeks, the Quitapahilla, which is a branch of the
Swatara, and runs into Sufquehannah at Middle
town, and the Tulpenhoking, which empties into
Schuylkill at Reading. Thcfe two cieeks lead
within 4 miles of each othei ; the level of then
head waters is nearly the fame, and the space be
tween them makes the height oÂ» land, or as 'tis
commonly called the crown lard, between the two
riveis, which is nearly a plain; and the bottom
of the canal through which the navigation mull
pass, will no where rife more than 30 feet above
the level of the head waters of the two cieeks
above mentioned, nor so much as 200 feet above
the level ot the waters of Sufquehannah or Schuyl
kill.
IV. The ground thro* which the canal must
pass from one head wat- r to the other of the fa id
two creeks, is a fort of gap or valley into which
much higher grounds on each fide descend in
gradual dopes from the distance ol several miles;
in which high grounds, many rivulets or (beams
of water are formed : supplied by perennial Iprings
riling in grouuds of e level much higher than the
high; ft part ofthecanal, some of these llreains car
ry mills thro' the year, and all of them united to
gether, would convey a large supply of water quite
fuflicient for all the purposes of tlie canal.
V. By actual and molt careful surveys and le
vcllings sundry times repeated, it is certain, it i
an established fa ft, that enough of the above laid
waters may be brought into the canal from sour
ces more than 20 feet above the level of the highefl
part of it, enough water I lay to carry a heavy saw
mill through the year ; which is as much water as
will be fully fufficient to supply a canal on the
largelt scale which can ever be neceirary in any fu
ture time.
And as these waters are derived from limestone
Iprings and other iources, that were never known
to fail, we have every reason to be airured thai
1 hey w ill afford a conltant peiennial supply of wa
ter , even through the d 1 yeft f afons of the year.
It appears then with most decided certainty,
that the communication in qucftion (however valt
and immense its importance) is practicable on the
latgeft icale requisite for all itsufes ; tor when wa
ter enough for ail the purposes of the canal can be
produced on the height of land, and which can
be let out either way as occasion requires, there
can be nothing impracticable, nor indeed very
difficult in forming the whole communication from
t iver to l iver in a manner cafy, fafe and fufficient
iv ;impleor exienfive for all its purposes.
VI. All 1 conceive neceirary to be done after
this is,
l. To make a fuccefliori of dams across the
crerks from each rivei 10 the height of land, so
conftru6ted, thai the tail of one pond may reach
the Gain next sbove it, and rife so much upon it
ai 10 produce the nccelfary depth of water ; these
dams are mostly built alreadv, and will require no
other ex pence than repairs, or ftrcngthemng for
more certain security, and perhaps fame height
ening, that the water of the pond may swell or rife
up to the dam above it, when thai is not the pre
fcrnt cafe.
2. F;om ihc !op of each dam to make wavs or
an inclined plane, leading down to the water of
the pond below, floored with strong pl<tnk, with
an angle of d?preffion fufficieut to give it a necef
lary but gradual dcfccnt, fay, it you please, one
foot in ten.
3. To make a cradle like a fled, if yon please,
with lidcs of very strong timber, 111 each of which
arc to be infcitcd two wheels, about 16 feet afun
BY DÂ£SI R E,
[Whole No. 328.]
der, on which the cradle will run up the ways, the
lower wheel to be of lomcwhat larger diameter
than the upper cne, that the lower part of the
boat's keel may be railed nearer to a level than the
floor ot the ways, then fink the cradle and draw
the boat over it, then laife it to the bottom of the
boat, and fallen the boat securely to it,
4. In the pond above the dam, and at fuflficient
diftaoce and height, fix a flrong poit, and to it faf
ten a large block and fhieve.
5. At the dam, close beside the head of the ways,
make a floom and gate, and fix a water wheel with
a (haft or axis parallel to the top of the dam, and
H right angles with the ways, the fliaft of which is
:o reach over the ways, and be of fufficient height
.0 admit the boat and cradle to pass under it.
6. To the tongue of'the cradle or fled (which
mutt be strongly braced) fix a chain or rope of fuf
ficient strength, cairy it up the ways, and reeve it
through the block fattened to the pott as aforefaid,
then carry it back and fatten it to the fhaft of the
water wheel,
7. Fix your cradle carefully in the midst of the
ways below, then hoitt the gate and set the water
wheel a going, and I conceive it will draw up a
boat of 40 tons, wi'h a tteady and fafe motion,
and launch it into the upper dam in one or two
minutes. You may at any time increase or di
rtiinifh yorir force by letting out more or iefs wa
ter on tUc water wheel.
8. When the boat is launched into the upper
pond, difengageit from the cradle, float it off", and
let it go on its pafl*age, and bring or. its place ano
ther boat, bound down ft ream, and fatten a chain
or rope tothe lower part or fterri of the cradle,
and make it fatt to the (haft of the water wheel
and the gate, which will immediately draw
the cradle over the hc?d of the wavs, when the
gate mud be inftaiuly (hut down, and the latt men
tioned chain mutt beinttantly disengaged, which
is mod eafilv and fafely Hone by a large iron bolt,
pierced perpendicular through a flrong timber in
the ttern of the cradle, and which will be drawn
out of course the moment it pitches over the head
of the ways, and brings the bolt light under the
Ibaft. The upper rope mutt: be fattened to the
tongue of the cradle, and I conceive the force ot'
the boat running down the ways will be fufficient
to turn the w?tcr wheel the contrary way, and un
wind the chain from off the fhaft ; if this should
not be fufficicnt, a little force may be added by
hands, or if the wheel should turn too violently,
it may be checked by letting a little water on it.
VII. The ways, water wheel, and house for
the people who tend the works, mutt be ciouded
up as near the fhoreas pofiible, that the middle of
the dam may be left as wide as may be for a watte
way, over which ice, logs, See. in times ot"
frefhes, may pass without touching or injuring the
works.
(To be concluded in our next.)
CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, April 23, 1792.
In committee oj the whole, on the the bill
for catling forth the militia.
MR- LIVERMORE objected to the general
terms ufcd in this feftion ; he thought the
nature of the offences intended to be guarded
againft,ought to be more particularly definedâ
that the sources from whence complaints Ihould
iil'ue Ihould be pointed out.
Mr. Benfon was in favor of introducing th<?
express words of the constitutionâand moved
to strike out certain expreflions for the purpofis
of substituting those words.
Mr. Whita observed, that the objections
which had now been started were considered
by the committee, and attempts Were made to
render the clause more express and definite,
but it was found they only rendered it more
obscure.
Mr. Baldwin said he conficiered the objection
of the gentleman from New-York as involving
a dangerous principleâit seems to suppose that
the general government only poffefles the pow
er to suppress infurreftions; whereas the States
individually certainlv pofTefs this power, they
can suppress infurrettions, and will do it; their
interest is involved in supporting the lawsâand
they are fully competent to do it.
Mr. Kittera said the "fnrlcmnn f;o:n New-
HainpOiire objects to the ciaufe because it is not
particular enoughâwhile the gentleman from
New-York thinks it not general enough ; he
thought that the ciaufe was very well exprelfed;
it adopts that medium which in fuGh cases is
perhaps always the fafeft.
Mr Page- I move to strike out the clauseâ/
it cannot be amended j I hope that there is ni>
occasion for such a clause, it holds out an idea
of resistance which I will not fuppoie can exilh
Mild and equitable laws will not be refitted, and
if Cong-eft should be so infatuated as to enact
those of a contrary natureâl hope they will
be repealed, and uot enforced by martial law f
we have fcen no occasion for three years past ofInch a law as is now fuppoftd necefTary. If the
refinance be finall (said a member from North-
Carolina) the magiitrates will be competent to
the businessâis great, it would not be prudent
to attempt to cruih it. It is not to
make Jaws merely because the constitution au
thorizes a dangeroir. power.
Mr. Murray laid he was opposed to the last
notion, aÂ» well as to that from the gentleman
from New-York. lie offered several remarks
to fh;w the necefiity of providing for an ener
getic execution of the laws, while at the fame
time he was fully imprefled with the importance
of having the power defined and guarded as
much as polUbie. He adverted to the Britilh
government, where a prompt and energetic ex
ecution of the law is considered of the firft im
portance, while at the fame time the military is
never called in but in the last extremity.âHe
gave a short account of the proceedings of that
government in the infurre&icn railed in the ci
ty of London, by Lord George Gordon, &:c.
Mr. Clark was in favor Â«f striking outâlie
said the motion from the gentleman of New-
York went to call forth the military in tale of'
tiny opposition to the excise law âCo that if an
old woman was to strike an excise officer with
a broomstick, forfooth the military is to be cal
led out to fuppref'. an infurrc&ion.âThe go
vernment lie obierved was in its infancyâand
lie saw no neceff.ty for fuppoling that the peo
ple would at tills early oppose the laws.
Mr. Benfon rose to explainâhe said his ideas
were he had no such designs as
were imputed to himâhis wilh was to provide
in the fnnpleft and belt manner for the object
contemplated in the bill.
Mr. Gerry said he was opposed to striking out
the section, but (till was not pleased with it al
togetherâand moved an amendment.
Mr. Mercer said he had not heard any pro
portion which pleased himâ"ie liked the feclion
as it stood better than any of them, but thought
that required some efTential alteration or addi
tion; he had no idea that this government was
to depend on the several State governments for
carrying its laws into execution. He then ad
verted to the two different powers in a commu
nity, the civil and militaryâthe firft is a deli
berative power, the other cannot deliberateâ
and therefore in no free country can the lat.ter
be called forth, nor martial law preclaimed but
under great reftriftions. He observed that the
general government had refpe<st to the persons
of the citizens of the several States, and not to
the government of those States; on this prin
ciple the marshals of the several States have a
power to call forth the pojj'c comitatusâand addi
tional marshals should be appointed, and only
in the last extremity they may call forth the
military power ; he was in favor on the whole
of retaining the fettion, and concluded by read
ing a clause which he propolcd ihould be insert
ed as an additional fe&ion.
Mr. Seney was in favor of retaining the
clause, but he thought it ought to be qualified
by foine explanatory article.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
MADRID, March 28
THE Queen was delivered this day
of a son, which has been bap
tized by the name of Don Philip :
all the foreign Ministers, the Nuncio
not excepted, were acquainted with
the event too late to be present at the
ceremony, which was over before
they came.
PARIS, ApiH to,
NA TIONAL ASSEMBL T, April 14,
NEGOCIATIONS with AUSTRIA
All the ministers having entered
the MaliâM. Duniourier then read
the dispatches which he had sent to
Vienna, and the answer which he
had that night received by an extra
ordinary courier.
The minister, in his letter, takes a
view of the different motives which
might influence foreign powers to
arm against France. Could the af
fairs of the Princes who laid claims
to Alface,&c. be afTigued'as a motive ?
It was proposed to adjuftit amicably,
and this therefore could only be the
pretext, and by no means the real
cause. Cotild it be to support the
cause of the emigrants ?âThe kinÂ«
had declared against: them : it was
the king who wished to maintain the
new government. Was it the Clubs
who had formed, or the pamphlets
which had been publiflied ? In that
cafe, other powers might have lon<r
fincc undertaken a cruf.de again If
England.
M. de Noail'es, the French ambas
sador at Vienna, observed in his let
ter to the niinifler, that the yontio
king was eager for war ; that he
hiiiili.lt had experienced so manv
mortifications, that he thought it un
iiecefTary to present the above dis
patch. He complained of the im
peachment of M. de Leflart, the late
liiinifter for foreign affairs, and de
sired leave to resign.
M. Dumourier then read a cop)' of
another dispatch to Francis, which
concluded with stating, That iinlefs
the King of the French received a
categorical answer, he mnft consider
himfelf as at war wiih the King of
Hungary ; and that if the armaments
in the neighbourhood of France were
coininued, it would beimpoUible to
restrain the resentment of an offend
ed nation. The miniller added, thai
the King had written with hia own
hand to his nephew, to remind him,
for the lait time, that on his decision
for peace or war muit depend the
peace of Europe, and the fame of his
own dates ; and to recjneft him, in
the name ot glory and humanity,not
lo plunge into an unjuit war. " I
have," laid his majesty, " freely ac
cepted the conftitutioil. I havefworji
with the nation, whose Hereditary
Representative I am, to live free or
die. M. de Mault, my AmbaiTador
Extraordinary, will explain my sen
timents more at large."

municate the difpatchts tranfinitted

of trust ; a decree of accusation was
pafied against hinu
APRIL 15
Before the minutes of Saturday
were read over and finally fettled,
the minister for foreign affairs in
formed the National Aflembly that
he had received a letter from M. de
Noailles, flaring, that he had obeyed
the King's orders, in delivering the
dispatches transmitted to him to the
King of Hungary.
This brought on a debate on the 5
propriety of revoking the decree of
accusation again ft M. ,le Noailles,
which, after a reference to the Di
plomatic Committee, was adjourned

The National Aflembly deliberat

King, considering that the Court of
Vienna, in contempt of treaties, has
continued to grant an open protecti
on to French rebels ; that it has ex
cited and formed a concert wiih se
veral powers of Europe against the
independence and security of the
French nation:
That t rancis I. King of Hungary
and Bohemia, has, by his notes of
the 18111 of March and 7th of April
latf, refufecl to renounce this concert :
That notwithflanding the propofi
lion made to him by the note of the
111 hof March, 1792, to reduce, on
both fides, to a peace establishment
the troops on the frontiers, he has
continued and increased the hoflile
preparations :
That he has formally infringed the
[sovereignty of the French nation, by
declaring that he would support the
pretentions of the German Princes,
pofTeflionaries in France, to whom
the French nation have continued to
offer indemnifications :
That he has attempted to divide
the French citizens, and to arm them
against one another, by holding out
support to the malcontents in the con
cert of powers ; considering, in fine,
that the refufal of an answer to the
last dispatches of the King of the
French, leaves no longer any hope
to obtain, by means of amicable neÂ«o
ciation, the redrefii of these diffeiem
grievances, and amounts to a decla-
ration of war, it decrees that there
exists a cafe of urgency.
The National A(Tembly declares,
that the French nation, faithful to
the principles consecrated by the con
ftitntion, not to undertake any war
with the view of making conquests,
and never to employ its force against
the liberty of any people, only take
up arms in defence of their liberty
and their independence ; that the
war, into which they are compelled
to enter, is not a war of nation against
nation, but the just defence of a free
people against the unjust oppreflion
of a monarch: that the French will
never confound their brothers with
real enemies ; that they will neglect
nothing to foften the rigours of war ;
to preserve their property, and pre
vent it from sustaining any injury
and to bring down upon theheadsof
those alone, who league themfelve*
against Liberty, all the evils iisfepa
raU'e from war.
Xhu* it adopts all ibofe foreigners
who, abjuring the cause of its ene
mies, fiiaii join its standard and co> -
fecrare their efforts in the defence of
freedom ; that it will even favour,
22
by all means in its power, their efla
blifliinent in France.
Deliberating 011 the formal propo

decreed the cafe of urgency, decrees
war againlt the King of Hungary and

The present diflnrbances in Swe
den cannot be ascribed to the influ
ence of liberty fentimfnts ; it is the
struggles of one tyranny against ano
ther. The nobles formerly exircifed
an unlimited oppreifive power, which
was overturned by the present King,
who took it into his own hands ; and
although the finances of the country
had been invoked by his schemes of
ambition, to which he was (limulated
by the old French government, yet
i he people nave enjoyed more privi
leges under him, and therefore pre
fer his despotism to that ofthfc no
bles.
A severe inquiry is on foot concern
it'g ihe accomplices of the aflaflin
Ankeiitroin ; but a degree of commo
tion in Stockholm rendeis it uncer
tain whether the prcfent Government
of Sweden may not yieid to a return
of tile former influence of the Order
of the Nobles and Gentry.
We cannot observe without regret
and indignation, the efforts of certain
> efllefs, turbulent, and fanatical fpi
its, who seek for employment and
distinction to themselves in confu(ioi)
and turmoil to their country, a- i
we hope that there will not be a i y
rapid or great increase, in number 0 ,

have had several meetings, and, we
underitand, regularly meet together
under the name of Friends to a Con

Thus at Venice, an author may bring

is that they there publish books a

Venetians render their religion sub

for the Senate there freely permit

neither liberty nor security that
anarchy, a state much inferior to the

to be rushing precipitately into thai

Monday lad: arrived in this city from Lon
don by the way of New-York, a model by which
the New Theatre of MeiTrs. Wignell and Rein
agle in Chefnut-ftreet is to be erected.âThis
plan has been pronounced by European archi
tects and perlons of taste and judgment, to be
better calculated for a building of convenient
and elegant accommodation, as well with res
pect to the performers as tire audience, than
any Theatre of equal dimensions hitherto con
ftru&ed. The model will in a few days be ex
hibited for the gratification of the curious.
The late European intelligence exhibits a
very interesting tho' confuled draft of the state
of affairs in that quarter of the globe. France,
finding that the combined powers of Austria,
Prussia, &c. were mak ng the most a&ive war
like preparations, while they continued tonego
ciate very indefinitely, has declared war against
the King of Bohemia and Hungary. This, it is
expelled, will consolidate the views of the na
tion; and while the ardor of the great body of
the people will lead them to the most strenuous
exertions against the common enemy of the
revolution, the legislature will be enabled to
complete without interruption the great busi
ness of arranging their finances, and finifliing
the internal organization of the kingdom. The
momentum of the new power, that of the peo
ple, will be felt, and fubmittcd to in all the de
partments ; and while so striking and important
an object is to be provided for as the war, taxes
will be paid with chearfulnefs, to P ich an amount
as that the treasury will probably be full and
flowing.âThe accounts from Austria and Prus
sia are vague ; the marchiug of troops to the
frontiers in large bodies, councils, meflengers,
and other concomitants of war are mentioned.
The King of Sardinia disclaims all lioftile inten
tions against France. The ex-princes and their
forces are quite in the back ground of the pic
ture. â >\veden must be in confufion since the
death of Guftavus ; their own concerns will
probably be luHicient to engross their whole at
tentionâan investigation of the lateafiaflination
is prosecuting.âThe Swiss Cantons do not ap
pear in a conspicuous situation at the present
crisis.âNo recent intelligence is received from
Spain which can enable us to determine what
part ihe will take in the war; her old habits,
and the late change in her ministry, are sup
posed to be favorable to France.âEngland will
probably remain neuter ; some, however, fup
pole her continental engagements will render it
difficult for her to keep out of the scrape. On
the v/hole, the French, united among themselves,
and animated by the fervor of liberty, will be
invincible, while their enemies will have to ast
with the utmost caution, left while theyattempt
to extinguish the fire of freedom in a neighbor

and pi oicft againtl the determination ot the majo

I. Because thcfc votes, having been given o
ih< freeholders of Otfego, and the packages con
tainirtgthe lame having been received, and tranl
mitted in season to the Secretary's office, by th
per lon aÂ£hng as fheiift ot the county, the commit

c>r extent of the (heriil's authority or Com million
Thcfc que-ftions being foreign to the duty ot thei
appointment, and capable of a decision only in th
ordinary courts of law.
11. Because, if the committee was by law au
thorifed tÂ» examine, and determine the legal it
and extent of the Sheriff's authority and commil
lion, we are of opinion that Richard R. Smith, a
the tim: he received and transmitted the ballots
was the lawful fberiff of Otfego. by the Confti
tulion the (Vieritf, whatever may be the form o
Ins commiflioh, mull hold his office during th

111 another is appointed, and takes upon himfel
ihe office. Richard R. Smith having been ap

min Gilbert having been appointed on the 30c;
March, 1792, but not having qualified, or takei
upon himfelf the office, until Richard R. Smitl
bad received and tianfinitted the ballots, Richari
R. Smith, at the time he received and forwarder
:hc lame, mutt be deemed the lawful Iheriffof th

d since the eftabliftiment of the constitution, pie
ludes all doubt refpe&ing its true conitru&ion o
!ns point. For, although the com millions of th
fheiifls are for one year, they neveithclefs continu
d toexercife the office, until others were appoint
and entered upon the execution thereof
which has ofien been long after the expiration o
the year, and sometimes after ihc fame person ha
remained in office lot more than tour years fuc
t (lively. And such fheriff sometimes after th
of their year, at others,after having hel<
'he office for tour fuccemve years, have receive<
and tranlmitted ballots for Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, and Senators, which ballots have, 01
former ele&ions, been received and canvaflVd
Ind even upon the present canvass, the committe
lave canvaflcd the ballots taken in the counties o
Kings, Orange and Wafhinton, notwithftandin,
he year had expired for which the fheritls o
liefc counties were commillioned, and no nev
:ommiflion had been itTccd. Hence the (herift
)f thole counties, in receiving and tranfmittin,
he ballots, must have atted under their forme
:ommiflions, since a mere appoint me fit without
omrniflion, and a compliance with the requilite
uefcribed by law, could not, in our opinion, giv
Â»nv authoiity as flieriff to the person so appointed
111. Because, if Richard R. Smith, at the tim
ie received aud forwarded the ballots, was 110
foe nil, the county was without a fhetitf, a pofitio:
00 rnifchicvous to be established by a doubtfu
:onftruÂ£lion of law.
IV. Because, ii Richard R. Smith was not c
r:ght fHeriff of the county at the time he receive*

:aÂ£t of that county ; and all the aÂ£ts of such an offi

erve and render effectual the rights of thiid per
ons, are valid in law.
V. Because, in all doubtful cases, ths committe
)ught, in our opinion, to decide in favor of th
/otcs given by the citizens, left by too nice am
rritical an exposition of the law, the rijht of fuf
rage be rendered nugatory.
We a!fo disTent from, and protcft against the de

Because, it appears that theffieriffof the fait

obefufficient; and as ihere is fatisfaftory evi
knee, that the box was delivered in the fa mi
late, ;n which it was received trom the fheriff
he votes in our opinion ought to be canvafled.
We also dilfent from, and protest against th'
letcrniiuation ot the major part of the laid com

was, by the greatest number of votes taken at th

hat Pierre Van Cortlandt was, by the greatcl

enant-Governor of this state. And that John Li

Because, itcannot be â¢fcertained whether Georg.

be considered in any other point of view, than
a continuation of that oppoiition which sprang
up immediately on the promulgation of thecon
ftitution to which the United States is indebted
for its prelent enjoyments and futureprofpe&s-
It may not be improper to exhibit, occasion
ally, an abi'haft of those sentiments and opini
ons, by which the party that supports this Na
tional Gazette propose to secure to the people the
bleflings of union, and a republican system of
government. C.
Tiie following national sentiments appear in
the National Gazette of Monday la.it:
" The fpirtted conduCl of some good old whigs of
1775, in deflroying the notification of the exciseman u1
Germantown, as a dilgracrijl of flavcry, may
convince our rulers that a Jree people unit not be
amused by financial palliatives.
" The government of the United States in all thingi
wishing to imitate the con apt principles 0/ the court of
Great Britain, has commenced the a J graceful career
by an etcife law, and during t/ie lajlfefjlon oj Congrejs
attempted a stamp duty on cards, with a faniliftcd
pretence to ditcourage gambling
N. B. The acquiescence of the refpeftive
dates in the excise law, is manifeft from this
circumstanceâthat they generally, if not all of
them, have repealed their state excile laws, in
consequence of that species of taxation's being
iffdmed by Cangrefs agreeable to the consti
tution.
Extract from the fame paper.
" A refpelakle minority in Congress (the [ingle note
of Gen. jjekfon might have frequently made it a ma
jority) have rearobatrd every one of the meaf ires that
are complained oj; andij Pennfy'vania had been re
prejenttdin the Senate, many oj those measures, which
mere carried only by the cafling voice of the Vice-Presi
dent, would perhaps never have been adopted."
Extract from Thursday's Gazette.
" That there wai an evident bias m the llmJc oj
Rcprefentatives, of a mojl lingular nature, in the vote
given the 2lft of March Ufi, mujt appear to every nu
partial examiner, who will take the trouble to call his
e\e ovet the Yets and Nays, where it will dearly ap
pear that the northern members generally voted in the
negative on the quejlion for declaring Gen. jfacljon en
titled to a feat."
This is truly republican indeed! Thus also
has the Speaker of the House been stigmatized
in the National Gazette as a prejudiced man, for
the abominable crime of exercising his own
judgment !
Another extract.
1 " Was it a hofi oj who, with the Pres
ident of the United States at their head, kicked out of
I doors the iradtiom/.ing reprejentation bill, to introduce
\a conftilutional one
This fliews the fent'iinents of the partyâ
from such intolerance may the United States
forever continue free.

TIXE EFFECTS OF SPIUNG.
REMOTE from noifc, in (Vies fcrene,
Old Taunton's dsui-capt fpircs afccnd,
The hills are cover'd o'er with green.
And blossoms make the forclls bend.
Tho' fools contest, and bigots rave,
Bright rcafon yet dircÂ£ts the foul,
While forae, just toti'ring o'er the grave,
Seem quite impatient of controui,
Let satyr keen, and w it rcfin'd,
Tianfmute enjoyment into pain,
Till ieafon ftimulatcs the romd
To court philosophy again.
Here heav'n-taught science rears her head,
And labor marks the road to wealth,
While foeial mirth, by fancy led,
EftablLfhes convenient health.
Here too, on plcafurc's airy tide,
We court the muses in the (hade,
Or on the ambient waters glide,
To fee the glimmering landscape fade.
Amufcment oft at evening hours,
Impels the rustic swain !o rove
In search of pinks and fweetell flowers,
To deck the bosom ct his love.
Enamour'd there he drops his head,
In vain he courts forbidden bliss;
And tho' he fails her charms to wed,
He now and then purloins a kiss.
Our cattle in the forcfts flray,
Our lambkins bound the meadows o'er,
Their gambols round their mothers play,
And vultures kindle fear no more.
Since herrings came our flreams to trace,
Health fpaikles on the damsel's cheeks,
She lures on (bore the finny race,
While rapturous joy her bosom fpcaks.
She takes the victim by the tail,
And bends her footfteps to her home ;
And as Hie winds along the vale,
She criesâ" the herring tribe is come!"
Now pie a Cure darts in ev'ry eye,
Each bosom glows with fervent heat;
The fainting more than gain supply,
The v/rctchcd quit their dark retreat.
The limping fire his crutch forgoes,
His wither'd limbs revive in bloom ;
He throws aside his bag of woes,
Nor yet salutes the sullen tomb.
O Spr INC! Thou happicft scene of man,
Push on thy blcflings through the year ! â
O let it endâas it began,
Without a sighâwithout a tear!
