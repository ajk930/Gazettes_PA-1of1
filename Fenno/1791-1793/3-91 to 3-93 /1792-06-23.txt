(concluded.)
MR- PAGE.âSuppose the cafe (Tiould hap
pen in which the militia should refufe to
ast, regulars then mull: be called inâa fair pre
text for a military establishment. Treason
has existed in every country; and has been pu
niJhed with the approbation of good menâand
should a combination too powerful take place,
and application be made for alliftance, let Con
gress make laws to provide for such cases in fu
ture, It should be remembered that the doc
trine now contended for, is that ver doflrine
which d ifmeir.be red the Britifti empire. Sir, it
would have been happy for Britain if this doc
trine had never been taught in that kingdom.
Soldiers, not militia, must be the proper tools
for the government that wishes to enforce its
laws by arms. But do the virtuous, patient,
fubmiliive and truly patriotic citizens of the
United States, deserve the fofpicion which is
excited againS them, and stigmatizes them in
the c'aufe which I move to strike out!
Such bills in a free state, where the people
ha\ e been taught to look upon the right of re
fufing i'ubntifiion to unconstitutional acts, may
excite infurreftions much easier than quell
them. n
Tie motion for striking out was negatived.
Mr. Steele moved to amend the feftion by
striking out the clause which authorizes the
Prelident ol the United to call out the militia of
one State to suppress infurreftions in another.
enforced this motion bv faying that he
hoped it would always be found that there were
a fufficient number cf persons within every
State weil affeited to the laws to suppress any
opjjofition to them within the State.
Mr. Murray replied to Mr. Steele, he said
that the gentleman's observations went to de
prive the people of one of the most obvious be
nefits ariiing from the fecial compact. He said
he ffiould be much obliged to t'ie gentleman if
he wou:d point out any other rcmedv for the
cafe contemplated, than that propoie'd, for his
own part he knew of none.
Mr. Giles observed, that the exigency con
templated by the ie&ion was of* so great magni
tude, that of the opposition of a whole ft ate to
the laws of the union, that it required a more
competent provision than was provided hy thin
bill. He was fully imprelfed with the propriety
of the government's poflefling a power to exe
cute its laws, ar.d to provide for its own lecu*
rityâftill he con fide red that the cafe to be pro
vided for, could not happen suddenly, and there,

Mr. Baldwin moved an amendment to the
2d ftftior, providing that information of any
inftiTreftion (Kail be communicated to the Fre
fidcat of the United States by one of the aflb
ciate justices, or the district judge ; which was
agreed to.
Mr. Mercer propafed an additional feflion
providing for the iiluing a proclamation by the
President of the United Statesarrd for the read

which was agreed te.

To the DIRECTORS and COMPANY of the
Sl'squ eh ann ah and Schuylkill Canal,
or Inland Navigation.
VII. T FREFER the natural beds of thecreeks
JL to artificial canals, for several reasons :
l. It preferve.Â«and benefits all the mills and water
works that are already, or may he built on those .
creeks, with the inconvenience only cf being obli
ged to stop, when the watersmay be so low as not to
afford a quantity fufficicnt for them and the canal
service. 2. They are less liable to caving, filling
up, absorption of water, &c. than artificial canal?.
3. Mill ponds have little current in them, even in
the highest frefhes. 4. They afford ample room for
all boats to pais and repafs, or stand still, as cir
(Tiimftances may require. 5. Roads, connexions
of farwns and neighbourhoods, will be less incom
moded by this than the other mode. 6. The ex
pence is vaftlv less in ibis than the other way, and
the probable benefits greater and more sure.
IX. I prefer the above mentioned machinery
for drawing the boats over the dams to locks for
several reasons; 1. It requires much less water ;
a. less time ; 3. is at least equally fafe ; 4. is in
less danger of damage ; locks are high dams which
all experience has taught us, are difficult to be
made secure ; 5. damage in them is more fatal
than in the others, for if the machinery Hiould
get out of repair, the boats might be drawn over
by capjlansworked by hand, till the machinery
could be repaired, but carrying away one lock
must suspend the whole trade; 6. damages are
more fpeeclily repaired in the one than the other ;
carrying away a lock in the soring or fall high wa
ters, would be irrepairable tiM the waters abated,
but breaking oi the machines may be repaired ar
anv time ; 7. the expence is much less in the one
mode, than in the other ; 8. in the vast empiie of
China, all the pans of the country are conne6>ed
by inland navigation, without a Angle lock, all the
boats (some of 200 tons) are drawn over the dams
by machinery ; their inland navigation is of older
date and in more nniverfal ufethan has exifled in
any oth'-r nation, and I think the long prafticeof
these ingenious people exhibits an example, which
we may fafely imitate.
On the whole matter, 1 suppose about 3Â®<Jamj
willhe fufficient between the two rivers, and I
isn't conceive that they would coll with the above
f.iid*nachinerymore<han 10001. each on an aver

Und I imagine can't col) mote than so.oool. all
which together requires but one third of our capi.
tal provided for the purpose, but as fdon't pre
tend to be adequate to this part of the fubicfi I
will drop it.
I beg leave heir to subjoin one word â with'ref
pect to the manner jtvf beginning the work viz
whereas the rooftefleniial part of the whole con
cere, conUfts lrf bringing a fufficient supply of
water on to the height of lied m ;hr ctttw. land
Ederation cou!d not with fa/ety be entxufted to
thev President of the United Statesâhe was
therefore in favor of linking out the clause.
MV. Gerry supported the cktjfeâhe denied
that it involved the conferences deduced by
the gentlemen opposed to it It does not sup
pose a state to tw in rebellionâsuch a supposition
cannot be supported, v.-hen it is considered that
in order to a Hate's being considered in that
light, a legislative ast rani prec de and accom
pany a declaration of the fact. He adverted to
facts to fliew the ueceffity of the provision. He
bad np objection to qualifying the cause by di
recting the marshals in the firft instance to ap
ply to the executives of the several states.
I Mr. Baldwin was opposed to the clause, and
in favor of striking outâhe adverted to the
conftitntion to fnew that it was not contem
plated thereby, that this power (hould be {light
ly delegated to the executive, and agreeable to
this idea the firft Congrafs bad dealt out this
power with a sparing hand.
The motion for striking out the clause was
negatived.
Mr. Steele moved to add a clause providing
for the intervening of a session of Congress pre
vious to the marching of the militia of one S ate
into another ; this after lbms debate was ne
gatived.
An amendment was then moved by Mr. Ma
dison to modify the feftion so as to delegate this
power to the President of the United States du
ring the recess of Congress.
Mr. Eenfon observed that with refpeft to the
ohjeft, State lines were perfectly idea!âthat an
inhabitant of one State was equally bound with
that of another to march to suppress insurrec
tions, and to assist in esecution of the laws as
much as the inhabitants of a State in which the
opposition to the laws existed.
The motion of Mr. Madison was agreed te.
[conoluped.]
[Whole No. 52,9.]
I think it would be proper to begin the work,
by the small c.malsor ditches which are *o carry
warer from ihe various streams and springs which
are To supply it on to the said crown land, that we
may have this great article afceusirred and con*
firmed by a&ual experiment, that we may know
the quantity of water we may depend on, for on
this the scale ofall the subsequent works must be
calculated.
Further, I don't conceive that ar.y arduous ef
forts of genius are like to be wanted in the whole
affair, I am of opinion that an original genius able
to calculate the scale and proportion of the work,
and place them so as to make the most advantage of
the grouud, the water, the means and materials,
which are obvious to every one, is all the ftockof
abilities required in a fuperintendant ; all that re
mains to complete the works is the employment
of faithful workmen of fufficient skill iu their se
veral trades, or the several parts of the business
which they are appointed to execute.
I object to any extravagant emoluments given
to the fuperiruendants, either principal or subor
dinate, this makes the concern a profitable jobb to
them, which lasts as long as the works last, and
ceases when they are completed, and of course
gives the fuperinteridants every inducement of
personal interest to prolong them as far as they
can
I would rather propose to give them a sum geÂ«
nerouflv adequate to their reasonable expences,
whilst they are employed, and when the works
are finifhed, give them for their reward, a certain
number of shares in the canal; this can be paid
by the company easier than cash, and this will in
duce the fuperintendants to complete the works
as perfe&ly and as soon as they can, for the more
perfect the works ar?, the more valuable will the
shares be, and the sooner the works are done, the
foonerthey will receive their profits : and I thiuk.
it always prudent as far as may be, to connect pub
lic considerations with private interestâin this es
say, I pretend no more than to exhibit the grand
principles and outlines of the great obje& in view,
if these are admitted, a thousand particulars which
the detail of the business will bring into view, will
be easily adjufltd by any genius adequate to the
diregion of it.
As the objcfl is allowed by every body to be of
vast magnitude, and most capitally conducive to
the interests of this city, and indeed the whole
State, as well as all the country weft of us, it
ought to be thoroughly investigated, and well un
derstood, and as the discovery of the true princi
ples, and forming the proper plans of any business
are eflential to the fuccefsful execution of it, any
attempt to develope and delineate them mtift ha
virtuous, the fubjeft is new to us all; I don't p>e
tend to comprehend ail its extent, but such thoughts
as have occurred tome, I offer to the company,
to be adopted, improved, or rejetted as they may
firtd expedient.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
LONDON, April 24.
THE iollowing most singular acci
dent happened at Cardiff, a few
days since : As the son of Mr. Jones,
school-master at that place, was at
tempting to pull some hair out of the
tail of a young horse, he entangled
his finger in such a manner, that in
his endeavors to extricate himlelf he
pricked the animal by some means,
which caused him to leap over a wall
near which he was (landing and drag
ged the boy after him, by which
means the poor fellow's brains were
dashed out, and otherwise rendered
a (hocking fpedtacle.
Mr. Wilbcrforce has been present
ed with a beautiful pidlurereprefent
ing a (lave in the temple of liberty
trampling on his chains. This pic
ture was executed and presented by
a Birmingham artist, as a small token
of his efteera for that gentleman, who
has Co arduously endeavoured to ef
fedi an abolition of the slave trade.
Letter from Earl St aKH ope t* M,
Condorcet, member of the
ty for the city of Paris.
London, April 3.
" IT is with extreme pleasure that
I have the honor to inform you, that
the House of Commons,' where I part
ed the whole night, have determined
that the Slave Trade shall be abolish
ed.
" The friends of the Blacks, with
Mr. Fox, Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Wilber
force at their head, prefled for the
immediate abolition, but they loft
this motion by a majority of 193 a
gainst 125 âand the House postponed
to another day the question for fixing
the period of the abolition ; but the
great question, that the trade shall be
abolished, was carried by a very great
majority, 230 against 8;. You will
*not fsjil in France, I hope, to follow
the example of Denmark and En
gland, and shew thereby, that yon
deserve to be free yourselves. We
touch, at length, the glorious mo
ment when philofopliy and reason
make justice triumph every where,
and when the friends of the rights
of mep will overthrow all abuses and
all tyrannies. Permit me ro rcongra
tulate you on the news which 1 fend
you
" P. S. Have the goodness to fejid
this letter, when you have read it,to
my refpe<ftable friend, M. la Roche
foucauld, begging him to fend it to
the worthy'Perion.
" There were about joo petitions
against the.slave trade."
Such were the terms in which Lord
Stanhope communicated this great
triumph of feeling and justice to his
friend, Condorcet, and the following
is M. Condot cet's obfervaiions on the
event.
" Thus, when Mirabean desired to
propose to the Condiment Assembly
to concert this law with the Engli/h
nationâa law commanded by huina
nity and judiceâwhen intrigue drove
him from the Tribuneâwhen a cor
rupted cabal ftifled his voiceâit was
not a philofophica] chimera which
â he promised ! Thus, within the space
of fifteen days, the friends of the
Blacks have seen the Representatives
of two great Nations confound the
calumnies of their detractors, ami
the fopbifms of the enemies to uni
verlal liberty ! Thus the moment is
come, when every year, every day
will be marked by the deftrucftion of
a prejudiceâwhen one, at lead, of
the chains of human kind will fall
off! Ah! who is the man so loft to
the fentitnents of nature, whose heart
does not find in these triumphs, con
solation again ft the injustice of weak
men, and the hatred of the satellites
of tyranny."
_ M. Briffbt, in announcing this glo
rious conquest over insane and debaf.
ing prejudices, faysâ" The enemies
of humanity will not fail to allert
that this is a trap, made by 500 cities
and communities, and supported by
100,000 English citizens, to catch and
deceive the French people."
It is very singular, that the King
of Sweden died in the persuasion that
Ankerftrom, even though he hadcon
fefled himfelf guilty, was not his as
sassin. He said that the person who
held the pistol was tall, whereas An'-
kerftrom is of a law stature. In con
fetjucnce Ankerftrom has been put to
the torture, in order to compel him
to confefs his accomplices, since there
were certainly two concerned in the
aflaflination, Ankerftrom, who held
the poignard, and the other tall per
son who discharged the pistol. An
kerftrom has, however, persisted in
declaring, that he was alone, and that
he alone wished to infliift that death
which was to do justice to humanity
by ridding it of a tyrant. '
As Toon as the aflaflination of the
King of Sweden was known, the fa
mous Nordermalm tolled in melan
choly.found ! This is a great bell in
a tower on the summit of a high
mountain, which is never heard but
on very important and alarming oc
casions. The panic which it struck,
may be eafijy conceived. Norder'-
lnalm has been tolled only twice since
its terrible annunciation of the flames
ifluing from the Royal Palace, in the
year 1697.
In the session of the National As
sembly of the 15th infl. a letter was
read from the Marine MiniOer, an
nouncing that 4000 men of the Nati
onal Guards and 2000 troops of the
line, had received orders to embark
for St. Domingo ; and that 2000 o
thers, half troops of the lineand half
guards, are detained for the Wind
ward islands, and will embark towards
the end of next month. He thinks
it neceflary, however, that the lalt
Jaw relative to the political rights of
the Mulattoes should be sent to the
Governors of the different Islands, by
a packet which is ready for that pur
pose. 1
Jp e Ki, 'S ? f Hungary's reply to
the French K.ng is considered as tan
tamount to a Declaration ol War â 
he demands for the French Monarch
his liberty and authority â¢ for the
Princes, their rights and possessions ;
for the Clergy, its property and ex
iflence ; for the Nobles, their priÂ»i.
leges, titles, and hereditary tranfmif,
lions. To support the above requifi
tions, the young Monarch will have
in Jirifgaw and the Netherlands,
i 50,000 Auflrian soldiers, 50,000 Pruf
flans, 15,000 Eleiftoral; Swedes
and Ruffians, 25.000 Spaniards ; ano
ther army in Piedmont, and the com
bined Squadrons. To which may be
added, the powerful body of Emi
grants. All this prodigious force
will be reajly by the middle of May.
The King of Spain returned the
Jacobins for answer, " That no pow-,
er has a right to demand the reason
of his adions, and that be /hall aJTign
none to any." This is signed bj the
Count d'Aianda. WAR, theicl'ore,
with France may be looked upon as
inevitable.
! The King of France was on hoi fe
I back on the 10th of February last in
I the great street offauxbourg Saint
Antoine, where a man was cleaning
the glades of the lamps. A country
man, who was passing, called out,
" Leave the lantern, and let Monsieur
Veto pass." The King immediately
changed his route, returning to the
Thuilleries.
The system of war and maflacre,fo
long supported by the profligate ty
ranny of Despots, is now falling into
deserved contempt. What can be so
horrible as the idea of thirty thou
sand men meeting thin, thonfand
men for the purpose os slaughter,
when the individuals have not the
fl'ghteft enmity to each ofwer, and
the promoters of the niifchief remain
at home in peace and luxury, to prey
upon the vitals of the Nations they
command
STANHOPE
The ignorance of the people is the
only security for Despotic Govern
ments. Enlighten mankind, and they
will be Free.
The total misrepresentation of facts
in whatever happens in France, the
vulgar abuses of a revolution, the most
glorious that was ever known in his-
Tory, the daily detracting from the
merit of the members who compose
the National Atfembly, and all the
lalflioods and infamies which dis
grace the hireling ministerial prints,
ihould serve to open the eyes of En
glifhinen to their true interests ; for
Inch pains would not be taken to vi- I
lify an event, unless Liberty wascon-
Iklered by people in power, as their
enemy.
How defetfive must be that mode
of education which can generate filch
a race of conceited ignorant puppies
as we fee swaggering in our streets,
and in the lobbies of our public plac
es ! Such a set of ill mannered boo
bies dHgrace the gallant nation to
which they belong.
People of title in this country ima
gine, that they have no occasion for
characterâthat, they think, is 6nly
fit for the vulgar.
Mr. Paine, in his two celebrated
works, has let the Cat out of the bag ;
the Aristocrats will find much diffi
culty to get the Cat in again. In
deed they will.
Men, of what is called Rank, are
frequently guilty of anions, which
would forever damn the fame ofpei

them to general contempt. So much

At a late trial, during the last sum
mer afhzes in Ireland, a Mr. Morton
prosecuted one John Farrei, for an
aliault, with an attempt to commit a
rape upon his daughter. The daugh

Morton had given his testimony for
the crown (as the term is), he wr.s
cross examined by the counfelfcr the

that in fupporc of the laws of my

The Judges were unanimously of opi

The insult offered by the People of Paris to the
bust and name of Fayette, has'given pain to all
who have ever heard a name, which alone gives an
idea of real greatness and disinterested patriotism.
This insult,- however unmerited, is perhaps not
wholly to be attributed to the blind and ufUhiiik*
ing madness of a mob. It is prohable that La
Fayette "has (hewn himfelf too prudent in the late
crfis, and that his caution, by minds enthusiastic
of liberty, mav have been mistaken tor want of
zeal in the good cause. It is certain that a line of
conduct ftriftly prdper in fettled and quiet times,
does not suit in times of political agitation. When
parties run high, the good cause mufl be supported
with enthuliafm and absolute violence, to outweigh
a&ivity and extravagance of oppofue partizans.

No country tinder Heaven pays more atten

As ignorance is the only basis on which ty
ranny can be supported, so knowledge is the only
fafeguard of civil liberty.
It is a fmgular omiflion in the politics of those
who find fault with public measures, that they
content themselves with mere efforts to alarm
the people, sometimes by innuendoes, and some
times by open abuse, without ever coming for
ward with a fpecific proportion to place the
great mass of the people in a situation to acquire
that information so necessary to enable them to
judge for themselves.âSo far from this, that on
the contrary, those parts of the union
which have done the molt in favor of uni

There cannot be a greater abuse of terms
than to denominate the man who advocates the
cause of learning and the dilTemination of know
ledge among the people, an enemy to the rights
of man. But such is the consistency of some,.
that those who have wrote and said the best
things'on this fubjedt that ever were penned or
uttered, have been held up to view as contem
ners of the people ! This inconsistency has been
carried furtherâthe man who has developed
and e<pofed the evils of an aristocratic govern
ment a manner superior to all other writers
on theVubjeft, is depicted as the great champion
of that moll deteftabie species of government!
At a numerous and refpe&able meeting of the
citizent of New-York on Monday last, in conie-
the decision of a majority of the joint
committee appointed to canvas the votes taken at
the last elcdlion for Governor, Lieutenant Govern
or, aud Senators of that Stateâa number of spi
rited iÂ£folutions were unanimously adopted rela
tive to the fubjeft, which state in substanceâthat
the rejection of the votes of the Freeholders of the
Counties of Otfego, Clinton and Tioga, taken at
the late ele&ion is unwarranted by the conftitu
tioji, contrary to law, and a dangerous violation of
the right of fuffiageâ that the warm and grateful
thanks Df all the ele&ors in the State are due to
the ininoiity of the said committee for the patri
otifra and firmnefs displayed by them in opposing
th 6 wanton attack which has been made on the
freedom of the peopleâthat it be recommended
to the independent electors of the fcveral counties
to enter into resolutions expreflive of their senti
ments on this very important occasion, and that
they be requcfted to unite with the the
city and county of New-York in an application
to the Legislature for a redress of the injury done
to the rights of the people. A committee of for
ty-one Citizens was alio appointed to communicate
t lie resolutions of the meeting to the different coun
ties of the State, to correspond with, frich com
mittees as may be appointed by the other counties
and to dcvife such measures as may be best calcu
lated to support the rights of the people.
As a counterpart to the above, there is a publi
cation in the New-Yoik Daily Advertifei of Tues
day, which states that the above meeting was called
by a partial invitation to the friends of libertyâ
that a general invitation was published the fame
day for the friends of libeity, who wilhed to sup
port the constitution, the government and laws,
to meet at the fame place at 12 o'clock the fame
day; that the citizens accordingly assembled, but
j those who firft met agreeable to the lajl invitation,
appearing to be the mod numerous, the leaders
of the party who adopted the resolutions, appre
hending their measures would be discussed and
debated, thought it most prudent not to proceed
to bufmefs at the time and place appointed.âThat
they accordingly adjourned to the portico of Tri
nity Church, where Robert Troup, Elq. mounted
in a chair in a hurried, tone of voice and with a coun
tenance Jo dijlorted as gave pain to alt who beheld him,
read oyer a set of resolutions, the contents of which
could iot be heard by the nearest bye-ftanderâ
that believer reversed a (ingle qucftion for tear of
a diflc.nt âthat he nominated a committee of
twenty or thirty persons for some purpose or
oiherâobtained with considerable difficulty four

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
The a&s of the general government, which j
the enemies of the public tranquility are indus- j
trioufly attempting to render odious to the peo
ple, are, the a<st making provision for the debt
of the United Statesâthe ast establishing a
Bankâand the Excise Law.âSupposing it pof- I
fible to effect a change of men, is it probable that
a change of measures in refpedt to these laws
would follow ?âWife men, if honest, would
pause before they would essentially alter the fyf- j
tems founded on those laws. The firft have pro
duced greater benefits than were anticipated;
tho' ther public expectation was high. The
short-lived concufiion which sprung from a tem
porary frenzy for speculation, was no more
chargeable on these systems than the abuse of!
the noblest faculties of man is an impeachment j
of the wisdom that formed those faculties.â
This aberration from the dictates of common |
sense has worked its own who can de
fer ibe tfye fatal consequences which would re
sult from a subversion of the exilling plans;
those refpectlng finance and revenue ?
It is of immense importance that a steady faith
in the {lability of the public counsels should be
supported. Let the people have fair playâlet
them be informed as to the realcharaElcrs of ni cn,
and they will not lightly chufe those to conduct
their affairs who are given to change, aud who
will make alterations that would plunge this
country in fceries of distress which have not hi
therto been experienced.
That change of measures which is so repeat
edly adverted to in the National GaztttCf which
appears to be so ardently wished for, and is so
frequently and confidently anticipated, is no
thing less than a subversion of the funding sys
tem !âHeaven avert such an event ! It would
be laying the axe to the great pillars of our na
tional prosperityâthe commerce, agriculture
and manufactures of the countryâand what is
worse than all, perhaps, it would open the flood
gates of {peculation, and consign us over to all
the horrors of national bankruptcy and national
infamy. Can those persons who attempt to un
settle the public confidence in theJlabilny of the'
most important measures of government, be ei
ther good men, or good citizens ? No, they are
not.
While our country is progrefling in arts, ma
nufactures, agriculture and commerceâwhile
universal peace and tranquility reign through
out the union (the alarms from savages alone ex
cepted)âwhile the legislatures of the refpedlive
states are recognizing the bleflings of peace,
LIBERTY and fafety, under the auspices of
the general and state governments*âthere are
persons so loft to the sense of gratitude to Hea
ven for these invaluable favors, as to employ
their whole time in attempts to four the pub
lic mind against the men, and again ft the mea
sures, which providence hath made the instru
ments of producing this unexanipled state of
public prosperity.

throdes allow ! FULLERTON, the iaithful ser
vant of the public, was in private life, a tender
husband, an inftruftive father, an indulgent m fter;
and be it here announced, the grateful plaudit of
his numerous friends, neighbors, and associates,
that
HE LIVEÂ® WITHOUT GUILE,
AND DIED WITHOUT REPROACH!
Departed this life, in April last, at Frankfort,
Kentucky, Mrs. Sa r ah Gan o/wife of the Rev.
Mr. John Gano, formerly Pastor of the Baptist
Church in New-York, from whence he removed
with his family in the year 1788, in order to preach
the Gospel in the Western World.

THE REQUEST.
XfÂ£ Lambkins that fporton yon mountain's green fide,
With a fleece that's as white as its-snow,
From your grazing O turn for a moment aiide,
And then bleat a' foft echo to woe.
Ye warblers that soar on the wings of the air,
That distend with foft rapture the throat,
Let pity induce ye to hear a fond prayer,
And O ! lend to my sorrows a note.
When Delta once fmil'd I were happy as ye
We alike'were exposed to fate :
The Jleel of detraction was aimed at me,
And malice spread fnarts for my feet.
Alike have we felt the keen pang of distress,
For the Lamb to the altar is bound,
The youug have been torn from your tender caress,
And my Delia has cruelly frown'd.
Go seek the fair Maid, ot-er till and o'er dale,
In her ear go and whisper )mr pain,
She'll certainly pity; then tell her my tale,
And O, mark if (he pities again.
But Ihould you not know her, if thousands you find,
By these tokens diftinguilh your choice,
You'll view all your innocence ftampt on her mind,
Hear your mnlic excell'd by her voice.

TANNED Sheep Skins at this day are in great
demand for a variety of ufesâbnt for want
of proper attention in taking off the wool, the
ikin is ft)any times so far injured as scarcely to
be worth dressing. The following method will
he found beneficialAs soon as the Ikin is ta
ken off the (heep's back, spread it on a horse or
cow, and in fix or eight hoars the wool will come
better than in any other way. After the wool is
off, spread the ikin on a pole, and let it hang in
the ihade (as the fun writ be very detrimental to
it) till convenient to fend it to a tanner. This
practice will render (beep skins of four times the
value they now are, and save thousands of pounds
to the country in a short time.
