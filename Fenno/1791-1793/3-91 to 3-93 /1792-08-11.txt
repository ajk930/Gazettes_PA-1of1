REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION
Concerning the Banks eJiabliJJiedin the United States.
THESE valuable institutions were unknown
to us before the revolution, being added
to the political economy in the latter part of
the war. The paper emiflions in the times of
the provinces, had yielded some of the advan-
tages of bank notes, though with less fafety to
those who received them.
which they were unavoidably recurred to, in
the course of the war, had completely destroyed
the utility of paper money in 1781
ot'public credit, and indeed of the public affairs
in general, as well as the exigencies of the cul-
tivators, merchants, and manufacturers, re-
quired an efficient substitute for an inftruinent
of negociation and dealing, of so great compass.
The scheme of a bank presented itfelf in the
manner, which is univerfaily known, as the
moll probable mean of accommodating the ge-
neral neceilities, political, agricultural, and
commercial.
The proniifes, which the plan
made, were abundantly fulfilled : and at the
fame tune a standard of public conduct and ac
tion in regard to the rights of property, was
linobfervediy eretted, at a moment when the
recent couil'e of events had rendered it very
deurabie, as well from political as moral confi-
de ations. It has been found, accordingly,
that the laws which concern property, in the
place> where banks have been established, have
quickly acquired a (lability, if they were good,
and have meliorated, if they were before ex-
ceptionable, notwithftandmg any supposed or
real errors in the plans or administration of the
institutions.
In reflecting upon these eftablifnments, one
cannot but call to mind a suggestion, which
frequently occurs, that too large a portion o1
the capital of the United States, has been appli-
Ed to them, Few pecuniary operations are of
as much importance. In eitimating the extent
to which we might have goi:e with prudence,
an examination of the It ate of that bulinefs in
a fuccefsful and at the fame time the best known
icene of trade in Europe, may be of iome use.
In the cis yof London, the bank oi' r.ngland (ex-
clufivel v of that of Scotland) has operated witl
a capital of more than fifty millions of dollars
about forty-lix years. The population of En-
gland, on a medium, during tnat term, has been
less than double that of the United States at
present ; yet the capital of its bank has been
above live times the capital of our national
bank, and near five times the amount of all
the l'ubfcriptions which are yet paid into all the
banks in the United States. There are, more
over, a great number of private banks in the
fame city, probably not less than sixty in num-
ber, some of which have more capital ltock,than
any bank in this country, except that of the
United States. The aggregate amount of their
capitak is probably equal to that of the bank
of England. Besides these, there are very ma
ny considerable private banks flattered through
the kingdom. In addition to these, there are
t!ie public and the private banks of Scotland.
If the banks of England and Scotland, public
and private, out of London, be equal to the
private banks of London alone, then the capi-
tal of those institutions in Great Britain, will
be 150,000,000 dollars, or above fourteen times
as many dollars as there are persons in that
kingdom, though the whole of the flocks of the
bank", in the United States, which are paid in,
are not equal to three times the number of their
inhabitants. Again. If the banks of Great
isritain be measured by the exports of that if- \
land, it will be found, that the latter, at their
higneft value (ninety millions of dollars) are on
ly three fifths of their aggregate bank capital,
and that our exports, at 18,250,000 dollars, are
above two thirds more than all our bank capi-
taJ, which is attuaHy paid in. Taking the Bri
tish imports at 80,000,000 of dollars, and those
of the United States at 24,000,000, the compa-
ri on will be liill more in favour of the discreti
on,whichlias been observed in the United States.
But a very important measure of these .institu
tions yet remains to be applied, by which pru
dent men will be dilpofed to test the fubjed.â
t'.e quantity of Jpecic. The bank capital of Great
Britain being, as above stated, about 150 mil
lions of do Jars, and the quantum of specie be
ing never estimated at more than 22,000, 0001.
sterling, or 97,700,000 dollars, the aggregate
bank capitals of the United States, as now paid
"in (ten and one half millions of dollars) would
be as prudently, aud iblidly founded on a quan
tity of specie a little less than lcven millions of
dollars. Although it would be impoflible to as
certain the precise amount of the lpecie of the
United States, eltimates carefully made, appear
to warrant a belief, that it is equal to thatfum.
But while examinations like these fecm to a
bate and even entirely to deftrov the apprehen
lion, that we may have pursued the business of
banking to the injury of agriculture, manufac
tures, and commerce, some circumstances of a
prudential nature are not to be overlooked.
When forming these establishments, we may
commit errors, perhaps, in carrying into one
scene too great a proportion of the capital ap
propriated te their creation. Hence the found
policy of 1 lib trailing from the niafs of the bank
of the United State*, to eftablilh branches at
New-York, Bolton, Baltimore, Chaiiefton, and
(as is intended) hi Virginia, ministering to the
convenience, the necelfities, and the interests
of government, the planter, the farmer, the
merchant, the navigator, the fifherman, the
ihipbuilder, the manufacturer and the mecha-
liic, in fix ll'veral and variant fcertes, instead of
accumulating"in"one greatmafs, a fuperabun-l
dant capitalâa political magnet attracting,
through devious courles, and attaching all things
to itss owq vicinitv.
But the degree in
It is poflible to err, too, in the disposition of
banking eflablifhments, by luperadding to thole
which already accommodate a particular scene,
rather than introducing the new institutions in
to places hitherto without them. The United
States contain fiye or fix great local I'ubdiviii
ons of trade, resulting principally from the im
perious dictates of the nature o}' things. 111 most
of those great spheres, there is more than one
considerable and flourilhing town, though there
is in each, one which has an acknowledged pie
eminence. When a reasonable portion of bank
capital has been introduced into one of these
commercial metropoles y the establishment of a
new bank would Teem to be most expedient in
the trading town of the next degree of confide
ration. It is true, that so far as the operation
The state
is an employment, or application of the proper
ty of individuals, it must be left (within the
laws) to their own will, but as the ast of in
corporation places the fubjedt within the pow
er of the legifiatures, and within the sphere of
their cares and duties, so it is highly important
that these institutions be modified in their ori
ginal formation, upon principles of distributive
justice, in regard to the reasonable accommoda
tion of the marts of commerce within their
sphere of legislation, and of all the landed citi
zens, who resort to them for the sales 01" their
furpins produce, or the purchase of their ftip
plies.
A precious consequence has resulted from the
distribution of banks through different parts of
the United States. Like all great objects,
these institutions, while operating very betieiti
cially in regard to the bnfinefs of a country, are
liable to be rendered instrumental to local par
ty views. Being committed, as in the United
States, to ten several boards of oi re&ors, seleCt
ed for the service on account of their property,
integrity, talents, and attention
and whole primary duties are the legal,difcrect,
and beneficial execution of their trust, it is not
probable, nor, indeed, is it in their to
deviate from their proper walk, into the ground
of political combination and intrigue.
A circumstance observable in the bank of the
United States, will not fail to attract the at
tention of cautious men. The portion of pub
lic debt, which enters into the composition oi
their stock, is the particular contemplated. In
this refpeft, the bank of England, and the bank
of Ireland (which are among the best accredited
of those institutions in Europe) exceed that of
the United States in the proportion of one third.
It is very favorable to our institution, that the
national debt, and ordinary and extraordi
nary cxpenfes of both Great-Britain and
Ireland are much greater in proportion to
wealth and numbers, than those of the United
States, and that our government is not lels free
from error, nor more likely to bedifturbed than
theirs. It cannot, therefore, be more unfafe
to confide in our institution, which contains
three fourths, than in theirs which is wholly |
composed of public debt. It is, moreover,true, I
and worthy of observation, that molt of the o
ther banks in the United States (and particu
larly the three largest) have voluntarily and by
their own operations placed considerable porti
ons of their stock upon the credit of the United
States, by purchafmg largely of the public debt,
and by giving at this time extensive credits
founded upon its security. The market value
of the public debt, which is generally greater
in specie than its nominal amount, renders that
part of the bank stock, which is composed of it,
intrinsically more valuable than that which is
in com.

Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,
TO contemplate offences, and to preteribe pu
nishments, are unpleafing but neceffar) talks;
being imposed by the nature of civil society, and
by those vices which often prompt individuals to
violate the rights ot othere.
All hough no propofnion is more true, than that
the intcreits and the duties of men are infeparablc,
yet it is unfortunately and equally tTue, that their
condutl dees not always correspond with the
eellent principle. Accurate ideas of intercll arc
far from being universal; and even of those who
know what is right, the number is not inconfi.
derablc, whom the delusion or lorce of predomi
nant pailions daily fcduce or impel to do wiong.
Hence it is that governments or laws which arc
calculated only on the virtues of mankind, always
terminate in difordcr and difappoiutmcnt, while,
on the contrary, those which legard only their
v ces are generally marked by opprcflion and un-l
j due fcvciity. Both should be considered with
I equal attention, or a juil cftimate of their influence

and operation cannot be formed,nor a proper mean
between the two extremes observed. It is pleai-
ing to remark, that the national laws appear to
have been mindful of both; for while they meet
tranfgrcflion with punilhment, their mildnels ma
nilcfts much confidence in the reason and virtue of
the peoplr. A confidence which the commenda
ble ohfervance of these laws has fully juftified.
Lei me remind you, gentlemen, that in all lo
cieties there will be individuals whose conduit
acknowiedges no morality but convenience ; and
who can only be restrained from offences by mo
tives adapted to their ideas of interestâthat is, by
penalties and by puniftimertt. Proceed ihen to
inquire, whether any or vibat offences against the
nauortal laws have been committed, and by whom,
within this diiirift: Or on the high seas by per-
sons in or belonging to it. All oficnces from trea
son to misdemeanors are the objects of your en-,
quirv. It is important that none of the laws be l
violated with impunity, for being al! made for the
good, and by the authority of the people, it is
highly intercfting to the prosperity and honor of
the nation, that they be refpefted and observed :
But as they differ in degrees of importance, it is
proper that your attention, although extended to
ail, ftiould in a particular mariner be directed to
those, whofc objects are of the greaJefl magnitude,
and whofc due obfcrvance more immediately con
cerns the public prosperity.
Of this jefcription are those that refpt ft the re
venueâthat revenue, which is tÂ« afford funds for
the fuppoit of our government, and confcquently
of our rights and liberties; and for the payment
of those debts which were contrasted for their de
fence and establishmentâ debtjÂ» which we are un-
der the highest moral as well as political obliga
tions to discharge with ihc utmost punctuality and
good faith.
Among the laws made frÂ»r these purposes, there
is one, whose name and obj 61 have rendered it li
able to misrepresentation, and to imputations ii
docs not me?itâ I mean the one commonly called
the excise aftâfirm la r names are apt to excite si- 1
milar ideas and prejudices; but things and not
names ought to decide our judgments. Enlight
ened citizens wi!l*fee and judge for themfeives,
and thereby avoid she rifquc of those impofnions
; by which artifiee usually dupes ignorance and cre
dulity. This ast in its provisions bears fcarcejy
any refembl2nce to those in Britain, which have
rendered their very titles odious. They who will
be at the trouble or comparing the ast in question
with them, will find that it ornirs and avoids all
those improper intruiions on domestic rights, and
â¦ii wii;ch have and
ever will and ought to excitc the margin^..â
free people.
The United Stales present to the world an un
precedented instance of a nation providing for all
their pecuniary exigencies, without having any
recourfc to dirctt taxation; or burthening the
ldiias, ar any of its pioduflions, with the Icail im
post or duty.
Should fraud be pra&ifed and permitted to pie
vail, the present happy system would cease to at
lord adequate fupplics; and neceflny would con
(train us to adopt modes of taxation less confiften
with our feelings, and in fcvcral refpetts more in
-.onvenient. Let it be remembered, that this rc
â¢enue is the people's revenueâ that the governmen
tisto iupport, is the people's governmentâtha
he debts it is to pay, are the people's debts ; an<
onfequently, that they who defraud the revenue
lefraud the people.
Among the crimes fpecified in what isgenerall
ailed the penal statute, there are two so danger
us to society, as always to mn it particular atten
ionâl mean the crime of perjury, and the crun
if forgery.
Independent of the abominable insult whio
>eijury offers to the Divine Being, there is no crim
riore extrvfively pernicious to society. It disco
ou r s and poisons the flieams of jultice, and b
Ã¼bftituting falfehood for truth, saps the tounda
ion of perlcnal and public rights. Controvcrfie
â¢ f various kinds exist at all times, and in all com
nunitiesâto decide them, courts of juflice are in
lituted; their decision mnft be regulated by evi
ience ; and the greaieft part of evidence will al
vays confill of the tellimotiy of witness âthi
eflimony is given under those solemn obligation!
rvhich an appeal to the God of truth imposes ;
f oaths should ccafe to be held sacred, our dcarei
md mod valuable rights would become insecure.
Forgt-ry involve* and argue> no common degre
>f turpitude and guihâalthough paflions canno
egally juftify or excufc crimes, yet their impull
orr.ctimes drives nun to commit cu'rages; whic!
n their cooler moments, they disapprove and rc
> rit of. The public good re quires that they he pu
lifhed, but they are neverthelels to be pitied. Hu
ie who commits forgery, has no violence of paflioi
o prompt, or palliate his con iuft. W'rh a hear
ontaminated with guilt, and a mind pollute*
vith iniquitous riefties snd defiens, he calmly an<
lelihemely piepare!. and begins his work.; an.
vith paiiencc and with caution pnrfnes it. II
etires as usual to his bee, and from interval to in

vhofe credulity, ignorance, or unsuspicious confi
fence lender them the moll tafy prey; and ex
its the utmofl powers of thought and refleftioi
o render fraud Â«md iniquity fuccv Uiul. The foll\
if all bad men is to be irgreticcJ ; but the punifh
nent of perfens so deliberately wicked, can merit
cry little compaflion.
In a country like this, where paper of various
.inds has become a medium in all our pecuniary
ranfaÂ£tions, forgery should be vigilantly watched,
nd ftvercly punilhcd ; ior, whenever theauthci.-

-which this species ot fraud could opeiate. Wills
and deed> not ot our osvn making, would incum
ber, endanger, and m many mitauces, dispose ot
our eflatcs ; efpecially-.it perjury ihould give to the
works of forgery numerous witnefic* to prove
their truth and authenticity.
That government may produce the benefits from
it, it is highly icquifite that their officers faithfully
do the duties of their refpettive stations. I have
no realon to fufpeli that any of them have a&ed.
otherwise than virtuously and worthily; but it is
nevertheless proper that attention be regularly paid
Ito their conduit, and that no instance of corrupt
or unlawful a els or omiflions pass unnoticed, thac
there be r.n exa&ions in public offices, nor any of
those reprehensible pra&ices tolerated, which un
der various forms and pretexts disgrace both the
officers and the government.
So tar as the prosperity of the people depenrf#
on a due observance of their laws, and so far as a
due observance of the laws dependson the detec
tion and punishment of tranfprrefiois ; so far, gen
tlemen, you ate responsible to the public for the
diligence and care with which your duties may be
fulfilled.
Be vigilant on the one hand ; be temperate on
the other. He cautious not to pay too liule, or
too great, refpeft to flight circumstances. Offend
ers know the value of silence and fccrecy ; and e
vidence, apparently trivial, often leads to evidence
plain and fatisfa&oiy. First, diligently inquire,
and then matuiely whether your evidence
be such as to juftify your making prrfentments, or
lo juftify your omitting to make them. Let u&

the innocent. ,
Your oath fuperadds new and folcmn obligati

any paflions to warp or mislead your judgments,
you are callcd upon to look to the affairs of the na

them in good order. Governments in manv rc
fpe&s must aÂ£l like individuals. When our affairs
are out pi order, we (hould 'ook to them to put

Extract from the Albany Gazette of
Augujl 2
" AN appeal to the people is to be hazarded on
very extraordinary occasions only ; perhaps no
cafe will juftify it but an elTential ciefcft in the
conditution. It is impolUble to forefee or fore
tell the dangers of a diiTolulion ot government ;
none can know where it will end or what efta
bliftiment will be next. The moment that ihe
people put mtoexcrcile that sovereign right of re ?
fuming their delegated powers, all tornis ot go
vernment cease, and theie remains no rule but that
ot the pa (lions, which arc as uncontroulable as the
winds ; what deltruÂ£lion they may produce, or
what direÂ£lion they may take,is totally uncertain ;
and it is an equal chance whether ihey fettle final
ly in the extremes of licentiousness or defpoiilm.
41 I know it to be the wishes of many, perhaps
they would carry with them the majority of the
state, that an opportunity might be afforded to
give our condttution more of * democratical cast.
It is to be feared, that in attempting to cUface
what they call us aristocratic features ihey would
vitally wound the excellencies tor which it is now
famed ; and those who are moil lorward to urge
on the drama, would have reason to rue the day on
which they took a part in it. The volunteer toall*
ot the mechanics of New-York, one of the most
numerous class of citizens, on the late anniversary
of independence, is but a spark escaped from the
pent up fires of a vulcano ; and will fuggdt, to the
mind of one who bu; a tew years ago has fecn
what disorders entered the field of politics, as soon
as soon as the fences ot government were thrown
down, presages of no dcfirable afpett. What
other toails may yet be in reserve, may baffle the
profoundeft politician** refcarches. On the con-
trary, we kuow there are opinions prevailing, that
it would promote our peace and welfaie, if the
interference of the people, in the appointment of
their officers, were more limitted than it is. In
New-Jeriey the governor is appointed by the Itâ
giflature, and as we now have a national president
and legifLture, they naturally prcfent to us ano
ther cafier mode of obtaining such an ofneer thaa
the turbulent one on which we have pra&ifed."
* May the happy period J'oon arrive when every civil
officer fliall be immediately elected by the people.

VIENNA, May ?
The following letter fromtheKing
of Hungary to Prince Stahremberg,
written on receiving the news of the
declaration of war against him by
France, will fliew how little he ex
pedted such an event :
"I am fort y, my dear Pt ince, to in
form you that France has provoked me
to a war, when I had but just mount
ed the throne of my ancestors. 1 have
done nothing to draw on me this war,
witness my last declaration to France ;
and a proof of it is, that I am not in
the least prepared for it. Inform my
dear States and faithful fubjecfls of
the Upper and Lower-Austria, that
they need not be chagrined ; that I
will not aggrieve them, for two years,
with any extraordinary imposition ;
to that purpose I have agreed, with
my brethren, to appropriate our en
tire heritage and all the property of
ourancellors. It is evident the French
attack us merely becaafe we follow
the late system of the late Emperor
our Father, who would not long fuf
fer the injuftice3 of a combination of
perverse men, who have not heft

treatment of the King of France, his

La Fayette's army improves in disci

those who were apprehended, that
whatever charges of mifcondu(si they
may. have against the Officers, he will
very readily hear their complaints,
and grant them any redress the cafe
may seem to require ; for while it is
the duty of the Police to prevent dis
orderly meetings, it can never be
their intention to interfere with the
innocent amufenients of the people.
Extratt of a litter from Paris, May 2
" Last week a patroJe of national
guards discovered in the middle of
the night, in the Place de Louis XV.
a detachment of Sans Culottes, who
wereVeparing to decapitate the ffa

licans were armed with hammers and
axes. Tbey informed the guards,
that they had regularly tried this
monarch before their special tribunal,
and it having been proved, that he
had been wickedly, raflily, and ill
advil'edly guilty of high treason a
gainst the nation, sentence of deca
pitation had been passed upon him,
which they were going to executeac
cordingly. These magiltrates were
conduced to prison by the national '
guards, without refpecfl for their \
high assumed office."
his majesty's birth day
The Qneen wore the mod costly
and beautilul dress that ever appear

dy and train, bordered with lilac, o
ver which was a covering of lace.
The petticoat gree:; filk,covered with
one piece of BrufleSs lace fix yards
wide, and one and an half long, the
only work of the kind ever made ;
over the petticoat was a loose drapery
of lilac silk, covered with lace, tied
up with branches of diamonds mount
ed as snow drops, with bows and loole
taiiels of diamonds hanging from
them. The bottom was flounced with
lace, headed with rows of diamonds.
Her majesty's head, dress was very
profufely ornamented with diamonds,
and she wore a diamond stomacher,
with a miniature of the King.
Each bouquet of her majelty's pet
ticoat had a central (lone 111 the ro-
fette valued at 20001. the rosette, in
eluding this (tone, is valued at 30001.
and the bouquets, of which there were
fix, at 80001. each. Adding to the
amount of these, that of the other
diamonds upon the petticoat, and
those upon the head dress and fto
mncher, the dress worn by her ma
jeiiy yesterday could not be worth
less than ioo,oool. and the taste dis
played in the arrangement of the

that he came from interested

!â¢ rtÂ»*s ctUmportry with, or rather antecedent to,
the commencement oÂ£ your paper. The firft num
ber of your paper is dated the 31ft of October,
â¢ 791, your appointment was announced iij the
ITaily Advertiser of Oaober 26, I 79 1 (a paper
printed in New-York) in the following terms:
" We hear from Philadelphia, that the Hon.
Thomas Jefferfon, Esq. Secretary of State for
the United States, has appointed Capt. X'hilip
Freneau Interpreter of the French Language
for the department of State."*
It is a fa ft, which the debates in the Virginia
Convention will teftify, that Mr. Jefferfon was
In the origin oppal'ed to the present Constitution
of the United States.
It is a fad known to every man who ap
proaches that officer (for he takes no pains to
conceal it, and will not thank you to deny it)
that he arraigns the principal measures of the
government, and it may be added,with indjereet
if not indecent warmth.
It is a fad which results from the whole com
plexion of your paper, that it is a paper intem
perately devoted to the abuse of the govern
ment, and all the conspicuous actors in it; ex
ceot tlie Secretary of State, and his coadjutors,
who are the constant theme of your panegyric.
Even the illtiftrious Patriot who presides at the
head of the government, has not escaped your
envenomed (hafts.
And from these fads, the inferences which have
been drawn are irrefiftable.
The circumstance of your having come from
another State to let up and conduct a new paper-,
the circumstance of tlie Editor of that new papa
being appointed a Clerk in the department of
Stateâthe coincidence in point of time oi that
appointment with the commencement of your paper,
or to speak more corre&ly, its precedency âthe
conformity between the complexion ot your
paper and the known politics of the head of the
department who employs youâthese circum
stances, collectively, leave r.odoubt ot your true
situationâthe conviction ariling from them is
too strong to be weakened'bv any of those bold,
r.* even solemn declarations, which are among
the hackneyed tricks employed by the purijls in
politics, of every country and age, to cheat the
people into a belief of their superior fan&ity,
integrity and virtue.
If you had been previously the conductor of
aÂ»newfpaper in this cityâif your appointment
bad been any considerable time subsequent to
the institution of your paper, there might have '
been some room for fubterfuge ; âbut as mat
ters (land, you have no possible escape.
The fact of the preliminary negociation
which brought you to this city, is not material,
when o many other fadh prefuppofingit concur;
but even this,if the scruples of family connexion,
or the dread of party resentment, does not pre
vent the evidence being brought forward, will
be proved inconteftibly ; not indeed a negocia
tion in which Thomas Jefferfon, Secretary of
State, was the immediate apent, but one car
ried on by a very powerful, influential and confiden
tial friend and aifociate of that gentleman.
That officer has had too considerable a part
of his political education amidit the intrigues
of an European court, to hazard a direst per
fonal commitment in such a cafeâhe knows
how to put a man in a situation calculat
ed to produce all the effects he desires, without
the grofi and aukward formality of telling him,
" Sir, I mean to hire you for the purpose."
It is impoflible for a correct mind not to pro
nounce, that, in the abftraft a connexion like
that which is acknowledged to subsist between
you arid Mr. Jeflferfon, between the editor of a
new/paper and the head of a department of the
government, is indelicate and unfit; and conse
quently of a nature to juftify suspicion.
A connection of that fort in a free country,
is a pernicious precedent, inconsistent with
those pretensions to extraordinary republican
purity, of* Which so suspicious a parade is upon
every occasion exhibited.
The apology you attempt for it is ill founded
anil inadmissibleâthere is no law, which annex
es a particular salary to the clerkship in questi
onâthe appointment is under the general au
thority given to the head of the deparment to
â¢appoint clerks with salaries not exceeding ag
gregately five hundred dollars to eachâthere is
therefore noreftridtion to the fumyou mention,
to induce as matter of neceflity the employ
ment of a person engaged in other occupations
âand not ordinarily and regularly attached to
the department.âFive hundred dollars or even
more might be legally given, for a clerk compe
tent to the duty, and if it was not fuHlcient
wholly to employ him, his 'surplus time might
be dedicated to other business of the depart
mentâNor could there have been any mighty
difficulty in finding a clerk so qualified.
But if i here had been such difficulty. Tome o
ther character should undoubtedly have been
foundâthe precedent of such a species of influ
ence erected over the press, ought to have been
avoidedâthis is so obvious, that the not hav
ing avoided it, is a proof of fmifter design.
The employment of Mr. Pintard by the Se
cretary of State, was a natural consequence of
particular situationâMr. Pintard,if lam right-
Jy informed, had been employed in the fame ca
pacity under the old government âand it was
natural enough to continue him in the occupa
tion and employmentâBut Mr. Pintard was
tot the printer oj a gazette.
These ftri&ures, though involving Mr. Fre
neau, it shall be confelfed, have been drawn
forth principally with a view to a character ol
greater importance in the communityâThey
aim at explaining a public officer, who has too
little scrupled to embarrass and disparage the
government of which he is a memberâand who
has been tTie prompter, open or iecret, of un
warrantable aspersions on men, who so long as
anions, not merely profeflions, fha'l be the true
test of patriotism and integrity, need never de
cline a comparison with him, of tl:eir titles to
the public esteem. An AMERICAN.

Philadelphia, Aug. il.
The Pittsburgh Gazette of last Saturday contain
the following intelligence, that according to a let
ter from Buifal'ie Creek, upwards of 4000 Indians
were affemblcd at the Miami villagesâthat ten
scouts of Indians were out intending to flrike on
the frontieisâ and that it was expected they wouici
soon itrike the Six Nations.
By a peifon from Fort Wafiiington, arrived at
information was received that Col.
Hardin, Major Trueman and two others were kil
led by the Indians, a iliort diilance from Fort Jef
ferfon, on their way to the Indian towns, to in
vite them to a treaty.
It is proposed in the Pittsburgh Gazette, that
the next menage or invitation for a treaty should
be sent by those members of Congtefs who pro
posed, and so ftienuoufly fupporied pacific mea
sures to be adopted at this period.
On Sunday last arrived at New-York, the Hoop

that he met a Capt. Welfli at Barbadoes (who
brought a cargo of tea from China) who informed
him that on his paflage he spoke with a ship be
longing to the hnglifh East-India Company, in
the Bay of Bengal, the Captain of which informed
him (Capt. Welsh) that Tippoo Saib had ceded
one halt of his territories to Lord Cornwallis, and
three millions of money sterling ; one million to
the Company, one million to Lord Cornwallis,
and the officers under his command, and the other
million to the afiiding powers.âCapt. M'Call
lays that he also read the fame in she Barbadoes
papers before he failed ; and that Tippoo had left
two of his sons hostages tor the due performance
of his agreement.

COMMUNICATION.
Despotic measures depend for their success
on the ignorance and blind credulity of the peo
ple ; and this is equally true of the influence
which certain characters, properly called de
magogues obtain in almost every community.
The degree dÂ£eftimation in which the un
principled fomenters of mifchief are held in so
ciety, is generally in exact proportion to the
light and information of the people,âHence
you seldom, if ever hear any thing in favor of
educating the poor and middling dalles of ci
tizens from those whose consequence is sup
ported by an implicit faith, on the part of their
adherents, in the projejjions they make.
It is now almofl universally admitted that
government has its legitimate origin, only from
the people ; how important does this consider
ation render the business of education ; for as
on the one hand a free government depends on
the wisdom and virtue of the community, so on
the other, the manoeuvres of those who would
persuade the people that liberty may be support
ed without government, than which 110 absur
dity can be greater, depends altogether on the
ignorance of mankind for their fuccefsful ope
ration.
Since writing the foregoing, our correspon
dent has read the General Advertijir of Thursday
lall. The preceding sentiments coincide with
u feleft remarks by a correspondent" in that
paperâand though the Gazette of the United
States has reiterated similar remarks a thou
sand times since its lirft publication yet,
cloathed in the elegant drels furnifhed by the
correspondent of the u General Advertiser,"
they must be read with pleasure and advantage:
\S cleft remarks l/y a Correspondent,â not the worse
FOR BEING TRUE,
IT is a maxim, too obvious to be disputed,
that an ignorant people cannot long preserve'
freedom. How then, it will be alked, are Sa-j
vages free ? They are so by nature. The li
berty of a Savage however, and that of a civil
ized man are efientiaHy different. Civil liberty
implies both restraint and protection ; but a
Savage is neither prote&ed nor retrained.
Where there is no government at all, men are
literally free ; but from a want of law they
cannot enjoy their freedom. Where there is
a despotic government the people are politi
cally (laves ; but still they are not in a worse
condition than Savages who remain as free as
nature formed them.
There cannot, speaking, be any ra
tional freedom without fixed laws. There can
be nÂ» such laws where there is no civilization.
83
And as an ignorant people cannot be called ci
vilized, they are witliout thole materials which
form the protection of law, and therefore can
not deem theinfeives free.
In tracing the causes of the decline of States,
one after another, we are pielented with a
(h iking demonstration of the truths jult men
tioned. It must happen that the iplendor and
pageantry of courts, the opulence and artifice
of a few individuals will create a glare of civil
ization, which dazzles the great bulk of a com
munity who are itill too unenlightened to be
called civilized. No nation delerves such an
appellation, where knowledge and property are
confined to a few persons ; any more than that
delerves to be called a learned nation, in which
a few individuals have made eminent attain
ments in science. The prevailing cast ot cha
racter among the people at large, is what
should constitute the national chara&er.
Where the inhabitants of any country are
destitute of the means of acquiring a current
information of public affairs, they cannot be
brought into a concert of views. They will
be imprelTed with discordant notions ot men
and measures, and it will be impoflible to pro
duce any union of sentiment. A bitter Ipirit
of party will inevitably attend such a situation,
and public spirit will expire in the rage ot
fadliojr.
The evils of fa&ion, however, will always be
checked in a community which poflfel's general
information. The attempts of turbulent and
intriguing men will soon be difcovercd and ea
sily defeated by a well informed people, and all
the avenues of public danger will be ftriftly
guarded. Such people will readily learn w hat
they ought to bear and what to refill. They
will seldom commit mistakes, because they are
raised above ignorance, which is the only foil
in which mistakes can grow. The public opin
ion will of course be just and venerable. It
will controul the formation of the laws, which
will be so congenial to the public wish, and the
public interest, that there can be no motive,
and consequently no chance for a bad execution,
i The only certainty that a law will be well ex
ecuted, results from its beings consonant to the
general opinionâbut how is an ignorant peo
ple to form any general opinion 5 The interest
of mankind and their duty are the fame thing.
It is only because people are unenlightened that
their ideas of thole objects lhould ever be so far
leparated as not to be exprefled by the fame
word. Nature made them alike, and why
should man make them different ?
Mr. Paine being informed that the British
ministry intend to bring a prosecution against
him, in a letter to the 4< Society for conltitu
tional information." observes, a nation (as well
the poor as the rich) has a right to know what
any works are which are made the fubjeft of
I prosecution." The getting out a cheap edi
tion is, I conceive, fays he, rendered more ne
| ccllaryâand he is accordingly proceeding with
the work.
The society took into consideration the con- i
tents of laid letterâand voted their thanks to
Mr. Paine, for his disinterested patriotiimâ
the society pafled sundry resolutions exprefllve
of their determination to Hipport the author of
the rights of manâand to persevere in the pro
secution of the work for which they aflociated.
