FROM THE FREEMAN-s JOURNAL
Mr. BAILEY,
IT is tie duty of every good citizen, and every prudent man,
to consider the nature and operation of the public rreafures,
that arc adopted from time to time by government, whether they
be those of Congress or the State Legislature. I found myfelt,
fatisfied on very little reflexion, with the impofton foreign goods,
and I fee plainly it tends to give a considerable part of the nc
ceffary revenue, and, at the fame time, to encourage manufac
turing at home. Smcc the new revenue law, or cxcife, as some
call it, has been patted, I have had it in my mind a good deal,
and turned it there much and often. On thinking for myfelf
(for I d â¢ not like any man to heat or cool me too much on pub
lic fubjtfts) some things strike me, which did not at firft occur,
and as they may not have come into the minds of some of my
countrymen, may be it will do no harm to fend them to your
free paper.
The firft remark that strikes me is, that by the
made, there appears to be no occasion Jor aland tax, or any otfw
kind oj taxy and no probability ot one, if this revenue is colleÂ£tÂ«l ;
for there seems enough impost and duty on spirit to keep us clear
of them all. Now I never did expert to fee the public debts of)
this country, and the expences of government and an Indian war/
all provided for at once, without one dollar of land tax, or tax oif
polls, or heads, or personal property ! I find too, if I have a
mind to be sober and frugal, and have a large family, whose
maintenance obliges mc to be so, I can make out with cider,
mead, metheglin and beer, without pay ing any of duty, and
I can fell my gain for food, or to those who make a trade of
distilling and brewing to fell by wholcfalc. There is no doubt
that thole, who do follow liquor-making as a trade, will do it
the cheaper, in propoition as they make it in large quantities,
and that they can afford to give a price for grain to diftill, which
it would not do tor an owner of a Hill of fitly gallons to pay.
The duty on the lowest foreign rum, is much higher than the du
ty on home made spirits ot the fame proof or strength. Ihe
home made spirits of grain and fruit, pay only nine cents, or
about eight pence Penufylvania money, which is cxaftly the du
ty laid by the of Assembly, and continued tor many, many
years, by as good patriotic whig as ever fat in this
State, o- in any other country upon earth. But foreign spirits
tf the famepioof pays 20 cents, or 18 pence Pennsylvania money,
whicn is above double the duty on our spirits. It is plain to me
that ttiis diff rence of eleven cents (or about ten pence) in favor
ot home-niude spirits, mull very soon stop the ute of any great
quantity 01 foreign rum and brandy, even on the ft:a coast, and
that it will put an end to it in the back country, the firft time we
have a good crop ?nd bad markets abroad. From accounts it
feims very likely that thts will be the cafe with our present crop,
This great difference in the duty in favor ot home made spirits,
will be tound a vast help to the farmer, and therefore found and
patriotic policy in Congress. It is better tor the maker of home
spirits, to pay eight pence on his rum, ai)d to have eighteen pence
Â«n rival Brill(h rum, than to be quite tree from duty, and have
only seven pence as before, on foreign spirits. Under the State
law, we had only 2 and 1-2 on foreign rum, and then our itills
had a worte chance, by fix or seven pence.
They think in Holland and Britain, that the growing of hops
and barley is a very profitable part of farming ; and it is plain
that America will be better off, by railing gieat quantities of them;
for the mofe various our produce, the more certain it will be that
wc shall get some of our crops through to advantage, in our va
rious fcafotis wet and dry. I therefore argue, that the high du
ties on foreign spirits (which have been very much increaf.d on
account of the duty on ours) will bring on a deal of brewing, ana
call for hops, and winter and fummcr barley, in large guanines.
Indeed I think, this very season there will be such a want of bar
ley, owing to the short impost of rum and molalfrs, that wheat
will be mahed in some places. It a man that ov\ ns a ft:II, will
â work it smartly and pay by the capacity of the still, and not by
the gallon, the duty will not stand him more than one third of
â what foreign rum is to pay, so he Can afford more for grain and
fruit to still. We know very well iri Pennsylvania, that old
William Penn was a fhrcwd fcnfible man. He kept peace with
the Savages better than any of the other proprietors, governors, or
old king's governors, thai we read of ; and he brought Pennsyl
vania forward by the foundations he laid, fafter than any country
m the world, in the fame time, This wife old man, in the year
1684. fixt a duty on spirits of all kinds, of twelve pence, as
the nest revenue for a young country. He justly observes, thai
the rich and the drunkard pay nearly the whole of it. The sober
ami modcrau pay lit le ; and any man may pay nothing by using
only cider, metheglin and bei r. Penn was certainly a very wife
man, a good Christian, a friend to liberty, civil and leligious, and
had a remarkable insight and foreh,;ht in the true interefl and ca
pacities ot this country, ft is my opinion, Mr. Bailey, that the
regulation of (piruuous liquors <s as importantto the happiness
Â©t man, and thetru ferviceof God, as schools and places of wor
ship. School a youth ever so well, teach him the way of a sober
and pious life ever so carefuiiy, he will be in the greatcft danger
it spirituous liquors be as plenty by him as the springs and foun
tains. Isa man will spend his money, or give his labor for drink,
ia such a degree as to make himfelt unfit for work, the more he
pays for it the better, because the price will set lomc bounds to
exccfTts. I find a particular comfoit in the excise, on the follow
ing'(coreâThe Stare debts, if ihev had not been afTumed, would
have remained for the States to pay. Havingvefted Congress with
the impost', the States would probably have laid a land tax, for
they could not have laid an excise without ruining the country
distilleries, unless Congress had raised the duty on foreign rum,
as rhey have done from a regard for the home distiller ; and it is
bui right. further to mark the scrupulous justice of Congress, in
regard to the money. In order that the money raised on stills
and spirits in the back country, might be applied to the immedi
ate benefit of the persons reTiding in those parts, they have provi
ded, that all that /lull be raised this year, by the revenue or ex
cise law, shall be pledged to pay the expences of General St.
Clair's, and QcfoeTaiScotl-s and other expeditions against the Sa
vages, thai harralsour back country, from Pennsylvania to Geor
gia. This is surely giving the bell and faireft course to things, and
is 1 iglit well done.
This dary is alio to be applied in part to renewing the treaty
with the emperor of Morocco, whose cruisers would take our
veiTeU and interrupt the iales of our fifh, grain, indigo, rice, to
baado and lumber in Europe, and the wine countries. Other
uses to which the money produced by the excise will be applied,
are to pa-y ofFonr de&ls to France and other friendly powers,

dtizen. who wishes that our government inay discharge these ob

glorious country, and will continue to grow, if we have peace at

\JVe have received several numbers of the BEE, a

appear in this Gazette.~\
FROM THE BEE
rT> EVOLUTIONS in l'ocieties and nations arc
-t\- not affairs universally demonstrable, that
owe their perfection or circUmscription to the
powers of the human mind. These belong ra
ther to the nature of cnufe and effect. 1 heir
hidden and secret nature are belt known by their
confcquences. One catfe however is obvious,
the opprejfion of men in power. Despotic govern
ments might preserve the peace and felicity of
their subjects by lenity and equicy of administra
tion. The people under such princes might be
cemented to their sovereigns without so much as
knowing for whyâat least without any inquiry
into the rights of sovereignty : But whenever op
preflion begins, the painlul chains speak to their
understanding more emphatically than all the
eloquence of Demosthenes. Another evident rea
son of (late-revolution is, the introduction of com
merce. The heads of the people might even be
generous and humane in framing an abfolnte go
vernment : But these principles being only flexi
ble, and corruptible by interest, what can lave a
nation from utter ruin, but the common and
commercial people ? and how (hall these become
saviours ot their country, unless by mechanical
ingenuity and commerce, they obtain influence
to raise up their dignity ? Unless they indultri
oufly cultivate those arts, which have fertility to
flip pi y the defeats of nature ? Oppreflion, there
fore, matching with influence and mental refine
ment, will fh uggie and debate from their own
weight and importance ; and the refulc mil ft turn
out according to the superior balance of contend
ing powers. Such things appear to have been
two causes of the French Revolution, which, if
as ftedfaftly maintained in infancy, as at the
birth, imift be productive of the manhood of li
berty. If these principles laid down are gene

[IT is an old, but ufeful adage -Read every author with ajeahus
eye. â Mankind would be under infinitely greater obligations 10
men of learning for their literary labors, were they more candid
in their remarks upon eath other ; there is a kind of Turkish po
licy predominant in theii obfervalions on cotemporaries ; not
merely imaginary rivalfhip, but any kind of equality is intolera
bleâand hence'it is very uncommon to find a generous acknow
ledgment of merit in the works of others, even on fubjefls in
which neither are particularly interested ; but with refpeft to an
oppofnion ol sentiment, it seldom fails to produce a copious ef
fnfion ol difqualifying epithets. Thele observations will apply
to differences in politicsâthe most brilliant success on the part of
those who are fortunate rivals, cannot defend them from the
fhafts of obloquy ; and tho the world may award the tribute of

design to benefit posterity no doubt, has configncd their me
mories to execration !1
I AM going to hazard an opinion, on which 1
would hazard my lifeâthat Fox, by far the
foperior man of the party, is remarkably defec
tive in the great and inventive properties of wif
domâfchemes, plans, information, or materials,
have ever been collected for Fox, by all the ta
lents and industry of a powerful party; and he
has, above all men, the faculty of inltantly giv
ing order and expression to uncouth and enor
mous mafles; but his mind not embracing the
origin of meaftires, it is a chance that he directs
them to the ruin or advantage of his party. I
will give as inllancesâthe coalitionâthe India
billâthe inherent riglu of regencyâand the

and he has incurred it, not from difhorielVy, for
if there be an honest man among the political ad

Who projected the coalition I am not inform
ed. By internal evidence, 1 ihould adjudged it
to be the idea of Burke ; the extravagant absur
dity of it suits 110 other mind.
The India bill, I am well aflured, is Burke's
own offspring, and it strongly bears the impres
sions of its parent.
The dodrine of hereditary regency was fur
niflied by Lord Loughborough ('the well known
Wedderburne) with abundant promises of autho
rities and reasons, which are not fulfilled.
In the trial of eloquence has been
employed like water"! n an inundation, withouc
judgment and without advantage.
All the objects in the contemplation of Mr.
Fox on these celebrated occasions, might have
been obtainedânot only without infamy, but
with applause,
Pitt has obtained them all, with abiliiies greatly
.lferior, but with the art of profiting by the er
rors of Fox. He has all the advantages of a coa
lition, by detaching Robinson* from his old
mailer. He has acquired more power in India,
than Mr. Fox aimed at, by only saving appear
ances with the King : he has acquired popularity
by a doiSrine respeCting the power of twoeftates
in Parliament, which if advanced by Mr. Fox,
would have procured his impeachmentâand he
has rendered his opponents the inftrument9 of
his own purposes refpecfting Mr. Haftings-j-.
Such are the superlative abilities of your Royal
Higlinefs's principal, though, perhaps, not your

COMMUNITY OF GOODS.
[EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OK JUDGK WILSON'.]
IN the early settlement of America we find two
experiments on the operation and effects of a
com.ii unity of goods : the iflue of each was very
unfortunate. Virginia was the scene of the firft ;
an inflruction was given to the colonists, that
during five years next after their landing, they
ihoulil trade jointlyâthat the produce of their
joint industry fhonid be depofiied in a common
magazine, and that from this common maga
zine, every one should be supplied under the di
rection of the council ! What were the conse
quences r 1 relate them in the words of the his
torian of Virginia.
" And now the English began to find the mis
take of forbidding and preventing private pro
perty ; for whilit they all laboured jointly to
gether, and were fed out of the common (lore,
happy was he that could flip from his labour, or
slubber over his work in any manner. Neither
had they any concern about the increase ; pre
suming however the crop prospered, thai the
public llore ninft maintain them, even the molt
honefl and industrious would scarcely take so
much pains in a week, as they would have done
for themselves in a day
The second experiment was made in the colo
ny of New-Plymouth. During A?veral years, all
commerce was carried on in one joint itockâ all
things were common to all ; and the necellaries
of life were daily distributed to eve y one from
the public store. But these regulaiionsfoon fur
nifhed abundant reasons for complaint, and pro
ved most fertile fouvces of common calamity.
The colonics were sometimes in danger of starv
ing"; and severe whipping, which was often ad
miniltered to promote labour, was only produc
tive of conltant and geneiwl difconient.
absurd policy became, at lalt, apparent to eveiy
one; and the introduction of excluiivc'property
immediately produced the mult comfortable
change in the colony, by invigorating-the pur
suits of its inhabitants.
The right of separate property seems to be
founded in the nature of men and things ; and
when societies become numerous, the eltablifh
ment of that right is highly important to the ex
istence, to the tranquility, to the convenience,
to the elegancies, to the refinements, and to some
of the virtues of civilized life.

PROVIDENCE. August 6.
On Friday morning the 29th ult. at four o'clock, departed
this life, at his house in this town, the Reverend JAMES MAN
NING, D D. President of Rhode-Island College, in the 54th
year of his age.
He was born in New-Jersey, and educated at Naflau Hall.
Soon alter he left College, he was called to the work of the mi
niftrv, by the Baptist Church at the Scots Plains, near Elizabeth
tow.n.
After maknig tours to each extreme of the United States (then
colonies) and preaching to different deft tute churches in sundry
places, he removed with his family to Warren in this S'ate,
preached to the church there, and opened a Latin School. In the
year 1765, he obtained a charter of incorpoÂ»ation for Rhode-
Iflnnd College, of which he was chosen President. In the year
1770, the College was removed here, and became with it of
comfe, where he has since prelided, and till of late years preached
steadily to the Baptist Church in this town.
In his youth he was lemarkablefor his dexterity in athletic ex
ereifes. for the fymetiy of his body, and gracefulnefs of his pcr
fon. His countenance was ftatcly and majestic, full of dignity,
goodrn fs and gravity ; and the temper of his mind was a coun
terpart of it. He was formed for enterprise, his address was
pleating, his manners enchanting, his voice harmonious, and his
eloquence irre(iilablc.
Having deeply imbibed the spirit of truth himfelf, as a preacher
of trie ; >fpc\, he was faithful in declaring the whole counsel of
God. H' studied plainness of fp-ech, and to be ufeful more
th.m to he celebrated. The good order, learning and refpe&abi
liv, of the Baptist Churches in the eastern states, are much owing
to his afiiduous attention to their welfare. The credit of his
name, and his oerfonal influence among them, perhaps have ne
arer been exceeded by any other chara&er.
O: the College he mufl be considered as the founder. He pre"-
sided with the singular advantage of a superior personal appear
ance, added to all his shining talents for governing and inftrufting
youth. From the fiift beginning of his Latin school at Warren,
through many discouragements, he has by coriftanf care and labor
raised thisJeat of learning to notice, to credit, and to refpeftabi
lity in the United States- Perhaps the hi (lory of no other CbU
lege will disclose a more rapid or greater maturity in
the course ot about 25 years. +
Although he seemed to he consigned to a sedentary life, yet he
was capable of more a&ive scenes. He had paid much attention
to'the government of his country, and had been honoured by this
state with a feat in the old Congress. In (late affaii she discover
ed an uncommon degree of sagacity, and might have made a fi
gure as a politician.
In clailical learning he was fully competent to the business of
teaching, although he devoted less time than some others in his
station to the study of the more abstruse sciences : in short, na
ture seemed to have furniftied him so completely, that little re
mained for art to ac,complifh. The resources of his genius were
great. In conversation he was at all times pleasant and entertain
ing. He had as many friends as acquaintance, and took no less
pains to serve his friends than acquire them.
death is a loss not to the College or Church only, but to the
world. He is lamented by the youth under his care, by the
Churches, by his fellow citizens, and, wherever his name has been
heard, in wharever quarter of the civil zed earth, the friends oT
fcieuce, of virtue and humanity, will drop a tender tear on the
news of his death.
His amiable lady, the wife of his youth, and the boast of her
sex, with all her fortitude of mind, which is great, must have funk
under the diftrefling loss, were she not sustained by Divine Grace.
May Heaven continue to support her, for earth must have loft its
â¢harms. Few persons ever enjoyed a more excellent constituti
on, or better health Increasing corpulence, occasioned chic fly
by his confinement to the labors of his station (for he was tempe
rate in his diet) gave him some complaints of ill health, of late
â years ; but what in particular fumifhed him with a singular pre
sentiment of his mortality is unknown*. He was seized with a
fit of the apoplexy, in which he remained mostly insensible for
about five days before his death.
On Saturday last his remains were carried into the College Hall,
where his funeral was attended, and.a prayer by the Rev. DÂ«.
Hitchcock, and afterwards deposited in the north burial place in
this town.

POLITIC 4L SKETCH.
[concluded.]
THE State of Delaware, though final!, is not
an unimportant branch of the geueal Concede
racy of the United Stares. She diltinguilhed
herfelf by an early adoption of the new conlti
tutiou, tliat equalizing fy Item, which in one great
and eflential point, effected at once for every
part of the Union, what the fovereisnty of none
of the particular States could do for itfelfâand
that was, to refcire the fmftll governments from
the impositions of the large.âThis community
of fieemen has it in contemplation to revile and
amend its conit irtltion of government ; may its
decifijus be founded on wilclom, and. their ef
fects more than realize its most sanguine expec
tations. Delaware partook largely in the de
valtations of the late war, and enjoys her pro
portion in the honors of a spirited refiliance to
tyranny âTime lias fir. Iwthed the furrows occa
(toned by its devaluation's, and more than restor
ed her agriculture to its former state of relpecta
bility.âHer population is encreafed, and the
additions conltantly making by emigrations,mult
add to her wealth and individual importance in
the Union.
The Commonwealth of Mnffachufetts has pas
sed ihro fnch an important change since thÂ£con
ftitution of the United Stares went into opera
tion, as amounts alinoft, in fafhionable phrale, to
a political regeneration : Previous to that event,
her immense debt, induced such severe taxation,
as enervated the hand of induflry, discouraged
commercial enterprizes, and diffufed a universal
gloom over the face of society. The measures
adopted by the general government have had a
moll: salutary influence 011 the affairs of ourconn
try at large ; but their visible effects have been
strikingly conspicuous in Maflachufetrs. That
just and equal provision of the funding fyltem,
by which the United States aflumed payment of
the State debts, was at once wife and popular ;
it relieved that State from a burden which an
honorable enthufiafin in the best of causes had
brought upon her, and at the fame time juftified
the expectations which her citizens had always
repnfed in the faith and honor of the union.â
In consequence of this, Maflachufetts has relin
quilhed the excise, and in other refpecls con
formed her legislative a<fis to the laws of the Uni
ted States in such manner as to give the happiest
facility to their operation.âMurmurs and dis
contents are no moreâand under a wife, firm
and steady administration, (lie is making rapid
progress in diminilhing her debts, encreafing
her resources, and promoting the general hap
piness of her citizens.
The manufactures of this State have b?en pro
digiously extended since the peaceâand her ar
ticles of export have greatly increasedâThe ci
tizens have enlarged and improved their plans
of public education, and to their infinite honor
have opened the doors of learning to the female
mind, upon terms of jutlice and equality. The
laws of the United States have in no instance ex
cited cabals, remonstrances, or resolutions.
The fecnrities of the United States are greatly
difFufed among the citizens of Maflachul'etts.â
The fubfcripiions to the funding system have
been general and amount to a very large num
ber of individuals*; the new revenue law, or ex
cise is carried into prompt executionâfor in this
State,as well asin all the others, the most refpetfl
able characters ate appointed, and have almost
universally accepted as fuperv! Â« >rs andinfpeÂ«fiors.
The population of this State, notwithstanding
the migrations have been very great, amounts
to almost half a million," and all freeâin the
census lately taken by'the niarflial of the di(lri<ft
âagainll the word Jlaves it is written, none.
New-Hampshire is nearly arrived to the im
portant period when her constitution is to be re
visedâand from the happy experience the States
have acquired in tranfac'ting business in public
allemblies, the happiest presages may be enter
tained of a favorable illue to the deliberations of
their convention. The citizens of this State, in
their habits, manners and fenriments refeinble
their neighbors of Mafiachufetts, but living in a
lef's compact situation, their intercourse with
each other is not so rapid, and intimate, and
their info rmation in the interior parts of the go
vernment is consequently more imperfert.âThe
Mate has recently taken measures to facilitate a
more general circulation of intelligence by es
tablishing po(hâthe feflions of their Legislature
have latterly been held in an inland townâin
which a public paper is eftablilhed, and which
is supported with spirit and genius.âThese cir
cumltances combined, will conduce to dillemi
nating full information among the people. One
article in the funding fyitem appears to have ex
cited some disapprobation on the part of New-
