The fallowing Account of
GUM ELASTIC, or INDIAN lIUBBEH,
is taken from THE BILE.
By Dr. AaneasoN,</Edinburgh.
On the vfes that may te made of Coutchovc, F.lajhc
Cum, vr Indian Rubber, in Arts and Manufactures,
with an act, our.t of the manner oj obtaining and ma
nufacturing it.
TIIE substance which forms the object of our
present disquisition is called Loutchouc. by
the natives of the country where it is spontane
ously produced. It is denominated elajlic g â¢,Â«,
01* elajtic refirty by philosophers in Europe j but it
is now generally known in the shops by the name
of Indian rubber \ a substance that few of our
readers are not acquainted with. It is a firm,
tough, pliable substance, greatly resembling some |
Jcina> of leather ; but it pofteffes a degree of"
el fticity that cannot be equalled by any known
substance in nature. It admits of beingftretch'd l
out in every direction to an aftoniOiing degree ;
and when the distending power is removed, it
recovers its former shape and appearance. It
neither can be difTolved in water, in ardent
spirits, in acids, nor alkaline in the or
dinary Itate of our atmosphere. Oils, in some
measure, a<ft upon it; but the vitriolic aetheri
is the only complete solvent of it that Is as yet 1
knou'a. It is inflammable, and burns with a â 
clear steady flame, emitting then a flight fme!','
not at all disagreeable. When exposed to a j
cold air, it is more hard and rigid than under a!
milder temperature, but it neither becomes fiu-!
id, nor loses its elasticity, till it be exposed to
a much more intense degree of heat than is ever
experienced in any climate on the globe. It
may, however, be melted by a very intense de
gree of heat; and then it aifumes a thick vis
cid appearance, like some kind; of femi-fluid
oils. And having once been reduced to that
state, it cannot be again made to acquire its
former consistence or elasticity.
This substance is now well known to be the
jnfpiiTated juice of" a tree. The natives in
thole regions where this tree abounds, extract
the juice by making longitudinal incisions in the
bark. It bleeds freely, and the juice, in a thick
state of femi-fluidity, is collected into vefl'els
placed to receive it at the bottom of the tree.
It is then, by means of a brush, spread upon
moulds prepared for the purpose, and fuffered
to dry in the fun, or before a fire, which, by
evaporating the moisture, soon brings it to the
state in which it is sent over to us. Ey adding
fucceflive layers above each ether, it may be
brought to any degree of thickness wanted ;
and by varying the form of the mould, it may
be made to a flume any ihape.or appearance you
incline; which shape, as has been laid, it will
ever afterward: retain, if no distending force
be applied to alter it.
From this limple detail of fa&s, it is easy to '
fee, that the uses to which this substance I
be applied in arts and manufactures are inriu J j
merable, and such as can be effected by no other
known substance in nature. Yet so blind have
mankind hitherto been to these advantages,
that no attempts have been made in any acces
sible region where ex ten five manufactures
could be established, either to cultivate the tree
that produces it, or to induce the natives to
fend tne juice in its fluid state to Eur ope, where
it could be properly manufactured. All that
has been done is, to fuffer the natives to mould
it into the. form of a finall kind of bottles,
which is found to answer some purpose among
themselves ; and these, when brought to Eu
rope, are applied to scarcely any other use than
being cut to pieces for the purpose of effacing
marks made upon paper by a black lead pencil,
or that of idly aniufing children by stretching it
out, and observing how perfectly it again reco
vers it pristine form, after having been distend
ed to agreat length in any direction. We a -
muse ourselves with the phenomenon without
profiting by it, as children uled to be amused
with the attraction of amber, before the pheno
mena of electricity were exolained.
It is now time, that we should begin to make
some use of this very valuable substance, which,
probably, a hundred years hence, will adminis
ter in a variety of ways to the accommodation
of our defendants. With that view, I /hall
here venture to point out a few of the ufeful
purposes it may be made to answer ; not doubt
ing but the invention of men, whenever they
can get the materials in their hands in abun
dance, will discover a variety of other impor
tant purposes it will serve, that have not as
yet been dreamt of.
1 ft- This substance so much resembles lea
ther, that it naturally occurs that it might be
employed for the pnrpofe of making boots.
These would not only admit of being made in
the neatest ftrape that could be imagined, but
aVo, by being impervious to water, or the other
cor ro five liquors above named, would be fu.fi
cient to protest men from wet, though Handing
in water. For feamcn, filhermen and others,
who are by their business obliged to wade in
water, such boots would be of the greatest uti
lityl The feet and legs might thus be protect
ed from the action of even acids or alkaline
substances theinfelves, wheievc-r that fnould
become necelTary.
2d. Clevei of this fubilar.ce would be so foft
and pliable, as to aUÂ»w tise fingers perfect ac

lion, and in tjio.e kinds of bufineiies, that re
quire artificers to put their hands among; acids
or corrosive liquors, they may become highiy
convenient.
3d. Caps. Tfee uses that might be made .of
thrir, iukftance for defending tlie head froin wat,
are infinitely v rious, and might piwe highly
beneficial. A thin covering of tliis fiibftance
might made .or travelling hats, which, witli
ouÂ£ adding any ecfble weight, would be per-'
fe&ly impervia! le by wet of any kind. Evjry
other kind of covering for the head, liiirht be
thins rendered water tight, merely by giving
thenf a cout of coutchouc, which would
in no tenable degree alter tlieir other qualities.
Bathing caps in particular, could thus be made
extremalv commodious, and at a fmallexpcnce.
This could be done, by covering with a coat of
coutchouc an elafticflocking cap, which, mere
ly by being pulled tight oVer 'the head, v ould
embrace every part of it all round, so as tc
prevent the entrance of water. The iiocking
and the covering being -equally elastic* they
would contrail and expand together without
any fort of difficulty.
4th. Umbrellas.â of jilt,
materials, cloaks or travelling coats of any
fort, that ihould be judged proper, could thus
be rendered perfectly water tight, without de
ft roving their pliability in the iinalleft degree.
It would only be ncceilaTy to cover them witli
a coat or this foft varnilh after tiÂ»ey were
made, so as to close up the feains. Buckets
too, ajl ofeanvas, or any other cheap substance,
might be made w.ater ti'&fat and incorruptible,
by merely covering them with this matter.
VclTels al.'o for holding water and other liquors,
that would not be liable to breakage, might
thus be made of any size or fiiape at a finall ex
pence. In fliort, it would take too much room
to attempt to enumerate half the uses that!
might be made of it in the houftiold way.
sth In the army and navy, its uses would
be still more numerous and important. Tents
are an article of very great expence : Thecan
vas for them rnuft be of the very best quality
and closest texture ; and ?fter all, they aie sel
dom proof continued fain. At any
rate, the vicifStudes of weather fben rot the
canvas, and make a new supply in a short time
be necciTarv. Were these tents covered with
a coat of this Aibffar ce, the er.t vanc e of rain
through it would not only be altogether preclud
ed, out also, the very wetting of the canvas it
felf would be prevented, and cfcourfe its dura
bility be augmented to a tenfold degree. On
the lame principle, the fails of a lliip would not
only be made to hold the wind in themoft com
plete manner, but by being covered by a thin
coat of it on both fides, the fail cloth itfelf could
never be wetted, and cf course, its durability
be augmented, while its flexibility would not
!be diminilhed. Other uses to which it could be
j applied :n the army and navy, are so numerous,
!as not to admit of being here foecified. It is
only neceiTary barely to mention, that on a mi
litary expedition, to have a velfel capable of
containing fluids, which, when empty, admits
of being wrapped up like a handkerchief and
put into the pocket, might on some occasions
be of inestimable value ; and the fame at sea.

" ROME is in mourning. O Pius the fixtii,
now that you are loading with favors a m?.n,
whom religion,.learning, and his country equal

lic opinion, I am more infallible than yourfelf
âBorn of an obfeure family, Maury had the
baseness to blulh at his originâeducated from
his youth upwards in the arts of intrigue and
hypocriiy, he grew ambitious of the honors of
the academy and the wealth of the church.
According as either was prosperous he courted 1
the atfceiilical Aleinbert or the jefuiticai Beau
mont. He preached up atheifiti and calumni
ated philosophy. Convinced of the w-eaknefs of
his abilities, he removed his rivals from the <a
cred tribunal by the most infamous accusations
In the heat of brutality he has endeavored to
seize by force the favors of unfufpecling beauty
aild ihtiocence, and has been known to alfume
the charactei c! an allajiin to be received as a
lover.âDecorated with literary titles, obtained
by the baled a; oftacy, enriched by the wealth
of a church'he had treated with the blacked in
gi atltnde, it'll his ambition was imlatisfied :
always imitating the serpent, which to raise it-
Jelf, muff creep, he became the defender and"
patron of slavery, and hired out his pen to a
despotic miniiterâthis vile supporter of ty

France, to intrude himielfamong the represent

IT is rather whiinfical, if the above
aphorism is true,, that the motive
to action, with tlie means and acquiii
cion, should so generally revei fe each
other. Dilliniftion is tie object of
pride: Infamy its acquisition, when
the means are not selected by virtue,
nor directed by judgment. It is not
difficult to read this truth in common
charactersâThose whimlical beings,
who, through poverty, laziness, or
mifanthiopy, get into the habits of
peculiarity in manr.ei s and dress, by
neglecting, or combating the general
opinion and taste of the world, are
not only denied its applauies, but
meet is reproaches anc! contempt ,
i and are no i> herwife did inguifhed,
than by their diitance the wrong way
frera ilie favoui ites ot mankind.â
This is a broad lubjeCt. Perhaps i:
would be easy to trace all the ciiines
that disgrace human nature to tins
one powerful pioj.enfity, the love of
diftindtion. This is the real cause
why one half of the woild is bowed
down, and enslaved by the burden
and tyranny of the other halfâwhy
the lofty towers and the splendid mo
numents of human glory, have- been
reared and decoiaitd in one age, and
broken down and totally fsvept away
in the next. It will e\er be the call ,
while we value no nioic the conlci
oufnefs of merit, than the utu ibuies
of it ftoleii from the woild, by fajfe
appearances and pretences, that true
fame, like the decayed titles of a once
valuable and honorable nobility, xle
'ccnded toa degeneraie progeny, v.ill
depreciate, and lole its original It amp
and principles, in the general plun
der of envy, ambition, accident and
knavery. And (he erior and evil
consequences, in the one cafe, is a
very exaCi referoblance of them in the
other. In both cases, real worth has
as little encouragement to expect, as
it has of motive to obtain, the tiiftinc
tion of mankind. lit a society where
this objetff, lb important to its glory
and faiety, has loft its power to iii
fpire a benevolent, emulative and pa
triotic difpofitioir, the weak and fun
pie members of it have every thing
to apprehend from the cunning and
powerful.
Much has been written, and maiiv
fever* things said, against piide : Yet
it is peihaps as necellary a propensity
as grows out of human nature. Be
cauJe I have wounded my finger with
my knife, 1 do not think pioper to
batter its edgeâNeither fhoitld the
moralist, in zealous revenge for the
blood it has spilt, endeavor to eradi
cate pride f'roul the heart. The ob
jrrt to which it is direded, flipuld be
feletfted by real'on, so likewise fliould
the means. And then, like the bieeze
that fills the fail, or the fpurto adull
horse, it adds a flimulator as well as
an impetus to progress and acqui
sition.

BOSTON, July 25
The French papers the Editor lia?
received, give the latest inieiligence
from France, yet arrived. They do
not however (and they are impartial)
contain a word rel'pecting either the
late intended flight of the French
or the miraculous deltru<Sion of
the i 5,000 troops of France, in a thin)
engagement with the Aultrians and
Rulihr.s; which the Englifli papers
hsve been so particular in detailipgâ
and which the American papers have
been so faithful in copying. A sum
mary of what they do contain, isâ
That the National Alfembly has been
agitated by a suspicion, that there
existed in Paris, a club inimical to
France, the members of which had
access to the Councils of the King,
a..d cjnveyed information of every
nieafure to Foreign Courts, even be
fore they were divulged in Franceâ
Thai the King had addressed the As
fembly on this subject, alluring them,
if such a body did exist, of which he
was doubtful, that he would take the
mod efficacious measures to discover
its members, and to defeat their ma
chinations. At the fame time he cau
tions the AUembly againtt being led]
ioto intemperate measures, by reports
and conjectures spread among them
solely to deceive them. â That a de
cree bad beeu debated for banishing
' from France, all the Clergy, who do
not take the civic oath.âThat a cen
sus of the inhabitants of Paris was in
agitation, in order to discover their
occupations, means of fubfifteiiie, and
probable objects âThat tbe revolu

bated, but daily displayed it fell" in
patriotic gifts and public facrifices.â

We have the pleaTure of inform

the Connecticut, by Miller's River to
the Nafiiua, and from thence to Laiv

may be as fuccefsful from Lancaller

would be advantageous to the capital

ALBANY, July 26.
The dwelling-house ofa Mr.Broik.
near Johnstown, was lately deftroj;cd
by fireâwhen three of his children
periihed in the flames, and the wh6le
of his boufe-hold furniture and wear-
ing apparel was consumed.âThis ve
ry melancholy affair happened in the
morning, when neither Mr. Brock
nor his wife were at homeâshe bad
gone about a mile distance to milk
h?r cows, and when she returned the
honfe was nearly consumed.
The dwelling-house and black
fmiih's (hop of Mr. Nathaniel Burr,
alf"o near Johnttown, was likewise
destroyed by fire a short time fiuce,
together with 100 dollars in bank
bills, which he had a few days before
obtained by mortgaging his farm to
the loan office, and all his house-hold
furniture, wearing apparel and work
ing tools, except two or three articles.
bath spring waters
Several chemical experiments liave
been made on these medicinal waters,
'oy different medical gentlemen. They
agree that the waters contain a neu-
'ral fait, which moll probably is the
vitriolic acid combined with an earth.
Further experiment will determine
this point with greater certainty. The
only ingredients used were nitrat
ed fi!ver, nitrated mercury, lime-wa
ter, fixed vegetable and pure volatile
alkalies and nutgalls. Evaporation
and diliillation were had recourse to.
Their operations upon the human
body are undoubted. Generally when
half a pint is taken anaufea is imme
diately excited ; when larger quan
tities are drank, ihey prove laxative
with foine, to others they act as an
emetic, and they generally increase
their appetite.
Upon the whole, the gentlemen
of the faculty conclude that the wa
ters may be of great service in dis
eases originating from a rednndar.cy
of bile,and relaxations of the (lotnach
and bowels being alfi> a molt excel
lent cold bath, they may be advanta
geoufiy used in cases of chronic rlieu
matiftns, and of,general de'oilit".

SINtE the day we attempted the Nation's
Gazette,
Pompofo's dull printer does nothing but fret;
Now preaching
And screeching,
Then nibbling
And scribbling,
Remarking
And barking,
Repining
And whining.
And ilili in a pet
From rooming till night with the Nation's Gazette.
Instead of whole columns, our page to abuse,
Your readers would rather be treated with news ;
While wars are a-brewing
And kingdoms undoing.
While monarch* are falling
And princesses squalling,
While France is reforming
And Irishmen storm ng â
In a glare of such splendour, what nonsense to fiet
At so humble a thing asâthe Nation's Gazette !
"o favours we afc'd from your frierds in the east;
On your wÂ« etched I left them to feall;
many bafc lies you have sent them in print,
That scarcely a roan at our paper will squint :
And now you
With a grunt and a grin.
With the bray of an ass,
And a visage of bras*.
With a quill in your hand, and a lie in your mouth,
To play the fame trick on the men of the south.
Cre'Xation&l Paper, you think, is enough
To flatter and lie, to pallaver and puff;
To preach up in favor of roonarchs and titles.
And garters, and ribbons, to prey on our vitals :
Who knows but our Congress will give it in tee,
And make Mr. Feono the grand patentee !
Then take to your scrapers
Other national papersâ
No logue Hi all eo snack*,

A* a rr.eafure mfil wifeâ
So a spaniel, when raster is angry and kicks it,
Soeaks up to bis {hoe, and fubmiiXively licks it.

Mr. Fen no,
YOUR correspondent T. L. in your paper of

ingenunufly. a\ man once argued on the fide of
Aiheiftn, becaufc the words, 44 There is no God"
were to be found in the Scnoture, without prefix
ing, The fool hath faiJ in his heart." Instead of
your correspondent's quotation, which ftandsthus,
" Rcce'.vcs a final! stipend for feivices rendered as

Election of Rtfrefentativcs in Congress.
IN this important business every individual
has a common interest, and the great object
ihould be to unite in exercising the inestimable
right of fuffrage in foch manner as will be most
likely to insure a continuation of the bleflings
we enjoy under an adminillration of the best of
governments.
The happy advantages derived from that in
ftitiition are evident tt> the world, and must be
acknowledged by all ranks of people and by eve
ry member of the society, who will compare the
present fitnation of our country ivith what it
was a few years ago.
It would therefore appear ad vifable, all other
circumstances equal, to endeavor by every law
furmeans to ele& such men as are tlrmly at
tached to the government and to such measures
as have been adopted under it for the support
and advancement of our true interests ; and
not be swayed by the artifices of those who stand
in oppoi-.tion, and who, disclaiming all party
and antifederal principles and views, are ex
erting their influence to have such a representa
tion as, it is feared, would join in bringing a
bout an entire change of mcafurec, and over
turn the whole of the system that is now in ope
ration ; by which means they would open a
new and exteniive field for speculation, and
disturb the peace and quiet of the community
tor the advaatage of a few.
Philadelphia, Aug. 4.
The BritHh Packet for June is arrived at
New-Yorkâletters byiier\Vere received at the
Pofl-Odice in this city, Thuriday evening ; the
packet brings accounts to the yth June.
French papers from Europe to the 6th â 
June, oy Cap t. Harding, iiatc âThat through
the exertions of Genera] C. Lameth, order and
discipline were likeiy to be loon restored in the
French army ; and 12 of the guilty of the regi
mentof Colonel-General concerned in the affair
of Mons were already iclectccl for trial.âThat
tiie joy of the emigrants at Coblentz 011 the liic
cefs of the Auilrians was excefliveâthey were
for marching immediately to the frontiers, per
suaded that every city would operi its gate's to
receive themâ t appears they checked their
ardour by a iittie timely reflection.
The National AUembly have decreed that
the grunt of one million a year to each of the
king's brothers be iuppreifedâtheir creditors
to apply to the National Treasury. A fraall
aifair has happened at Bavey, a body of Amlri
ans of 2300 men and 6 pieces of cannon attack
ed the place on the 17th May ; the Frciicbgar
rilon of 8o men fliewed much courage, and
killed and wounded some of the enemy âbut de
viating from the orders given by M. liocham
bcau, they were made prii'oners of war; the
Aultrians kept polfelSon of the town only 2
nours, they then left it carrying away the arms
but withont plundering it, which the foidiers
were very delirous of doing, but were restrain
ed by their oliicers ; the place would probably
have been immediately retaken, as a large de
tachment of the French army was put in 1110-
tion for that purpoJe. Warlike preparations
are carried on with great vigor in Berlinâbut
doubts appear to be entertained by the Court of
Vienna, a: to the honelty of the Court of
Pruiiia. The declaration of war has produced
very different,legations, at the Hagueâthe pa
triots in the seven provinces are laid to be all
in favor of the Frenchâthe Stadtholdcr on the
contrary appears desirous to take part in the
war againlt Franceâbut the States will never
consent to it.
Trie papers received by Capt. Harding, are
several days later than thole which furniftied
the materials for the abftraft, from the Centi
nel. No engagement of importance had taken
place in May. In such Jkirmiihcs- as had occur
red, the French troops fliewed discipline arid
courage. Some time fmcean account was pub-
liftied of the defeat of a detachment of M. la
Fayette's army, under the command of M.
Gouvion, on a foraging party, by an inferior
force. That account is far from the truth. It 1
appears that M. Gouvion was attacked by a fu- 1
perior force, but managed a retreat with great
lkill and success, having, notwithstanding the
opposition he experienced, attained the object
of his expedition, with little or no loss.
Mr. Rochambeau, tis said, retires; nothing
however positive and conciufive is publiihed on
this head.
AN AMERICAN.
Nothing said of the death of the Emprefp of
RuiTia.âUnder t'.ie Vienna head of May 14,'
we find an account of the death of the Emprels'
Dowager of Germany.
Paris was in a flute of fomefermentation the
latter end of May. Some proceedings on the
exigence of an Austrian committee (which is
yet far from being proved) gave rife to the fer
mentation. No actual disturbance.
Captain Harding, left the
6th of June. American produce at that time j
was low, and there -were pleafmg accounts of;
plentiful crops all over France.
The fliip Phoebe, Capt. Justice, left Lisbon
the 27th June, at which time the Queen was
recovering from her late indisposition. Two
ships of the line, and two frigates were fitting
out, that the Queen, accompanied by Dr. Wil
lis, might, in a short voyage, enjoy the benefit
of the sea air.
Ey the Pittlburgh gazette of 28th ult. we are
informed that the Cornplanter and other chiefs
who met in council at Buffaloe-Creek, have de
termined to fend a message to the lioftile Indi
ans, and have difpatchedCapt. Henry and three
other Indians with itâThat Capt. Brady had
made a tour of 30 days into the Indian country
âfrom some hints thrown out since his return,
it appears that he couid not approach Sandu&y,
nearer than within five miles, as there were a
great number of Indians in the woods near tlut
place.
The result of the several meetings of the ci
tizens at the State House, refpeflling the cha

44 They now and then kill some of our ci

killed within 3 miles of Columbia a Mr. James
Nevil, a Lieut, in our militiaâa young man of
great worth ; they nearly Ikinned his head all
over in taking of his scalp. The loss of this
valuable member of society was greatly regret
ted, and was a very severe blow to his afflitted
mother, who had but a few months before fol
lowed her husband to the grave ; and was left
with ievcral fmail children, leaning and depend

cency ; the Rsv- John Smith preached a funeral
fermoa on the occasion. A Mr. Ball was killed
or taken prisoner at the fame time ; Ire has not
lince been heard of. A Mr. Orcut who was in
company received two wounds, but got in and
is nearly recovered. About the beginning ol
May 3 men were killed at Diuilap's fiatioiiâ
and within a few week, two men were killed
on the road between Cincinnati ami Lexington.
Three amballadors are lent to the different In
dian nations, to negotiate a peace,âa Mr. Ge
rard, an inhabitant of Columbia to the Shawa
nefeâMajor Trueman to the Delawares âand
Col. Hardin to the Vv iandots(as I am informed.)
"Y/e have as yet no news from them and grow
uneafv on their account.
u The Indians who are prisoner* at Fort-
Wafhingt-on, behave as 1 am told with great
fortitude and propriety ; and are industrious in
their way, when they can get any thing to do,
and seem anxious to procure wampum. The
Ihdiati Queen is wellâa week or two ago Ma
jor Trueman alked her acceptance of a guinea,
which ihe Teemed not to know the value of; but
being informed it would procure her io much
she accepted it with becoming grati
tude ; fipce which their greatest artists have
beeu busily employed in making a belt of the most
brilliant kind ; after they had linifhed this, they
took a DodVor Brown who is in the medical de
partment, a man ef great humanity and good
ness of heart, who on all occaiions had sympa
thized with them in their captivity ; and with
all the ceremonies of Royalty crowned him
King of their nationâalter the Coronation the
Queen approached and paid him all that homage
due to his Majesty, her rightful sovereign
after which all the reft in due order approached
and paid their obeisance. They had procured
for him all the Kingly robes in their power, and
drelfed him in the grand belt of wampum they
had made."
In the National Gazette of Wednesday last
it is said, " since the operation of the general
;overnment, leveral branches of the mechanics
and manufacturers, and even the pilots have
cojjibiued to raile their wages on their employ
ers." In the lame paper it is said that the anti
republicans are those who would support the
government upon manufadurcs ; it is also said in
the fame paper that the agricultural interest is
the only true and solid natural basis of the go
vernment of the United States : on all which a
correspondent remarks, that those who affect
to set up one interest in opposition to another,
under a free government, where all have an
6qual right to protection, is equally an enemy
to both. Can either interest flourifli independ
ent of the other ?
It is an old artifice of the enemies of the real
happiness and freedom of our country, to sow
divisions and create jealousies between the agri
cultural or landed interest, and the commercial,
manufacturing and mechanical; but we trust
the people are too wife to be duped by these fel
n(h, partial politicians, or to be thus cheated
out of those substantial blessings which depend
on unanimity alone.
With refpeft to an enhancement of wages,
on the part of the mechanics, &:c. if it Is a
fafr, what does it import but this j that money
is plentier than it has been ; or that there is a
scarcity of hands, or an encreafe in the price of
Tome of the necefFaries of lifeâto which may
'oe added the rife of rents, occasioned by the in
flux of foreigners, and the great accession to the
number of citizens, drawn hither in consequence
of this being the feat of government ? With ref
peft to the pilots, it is well known that they
have been dilTatislied with their customary fees
for several years; grant however that wages
are raised, what is the natural inference which
candor would deduce from the circumitance ?
It is this, that the influx of money, arifiugfrora
the demand for our produce, the security and
confidence enjoyed under the government,
which has awakened every latent spring of ex
ertion and enterprize in the human mind, have
created an extraordinary demand for the labor
of artizans in almost every branch of businessâ
particularly in this metropolisâand should this
be the cafe every where, it is but a more exten
rive symptom of this general fa&, that an ex
cess in the circulating medium will uniformly
occasion in a Jru country, an addition to the price
oHabor in every branch j in a free country, I fay;
for it is not the cafe in despotic governments,
where one even tenor of reward, labor and fuf
tenaqce, are apportioned to the agricultural,
mechanic, and manufacturing interests by the
hand of arbitrary power.
tl The blessed advantages of the government is alone
to be found among jpeculators who are living on the
spoils of an injured and infuUcd people, and among a
jew needy citizens who enjoy the profits of lucrative
offices." âSee. National Gazette of Wednesday last.
The junta have not explicitly laid in the National
Gazette, that the public debt ought to have been
annihilated ; hut tis well known, fays a correspon
dent, that u was and is their opinion ; that as the
public had the power, they had the right to do it :
fonie ot the enemies of the funding lyftem were
not lo destitute of piincipleâthey acknowledged
thejuftice ot the debt ; and it is said, projected
fyftemsof their own on various calculations. It
is however to be remaiked, that none of them,
which lud the semblance of honor lor their lup
port, would have precluded (peculation ; some of
them would have opened a door to this bufine(s
that neither the present, or future generations
would have seen doled ; otheis wete predicated
on a \>afis that would have ground the people to
powder in their execution, and at the fame time
have damned the public credit forever : one of
them propcled to have paid an higher interest than
is now paid on the whole debt, and lo make an
rual grants for that purpose,âSpeculation has rea
<oo to lament that this plan was not adopted.
In every stage of the bufintfs, the declaimers a
gaiuft the system which was finally agreed to, have
shewn their incompetency'to manage the finances
of this country. As was early predi&ed,the fund
ing system has brought fpe.ulation nearly to a
close, and in a much Ihoiur period than its mod
fanguinc friends cxpidted. The value oi the debt
in tbe.fnarket is now almost, if not quite as fta
uonary as bills of exchange ; but it [he machina
tions of the new confci vators of our peace, ho
nor and public credit, should prevail, a scene of
[peculation would be openedthat would coufound
the advocates for the dignity of our species. The
people ot this country are too ienfible ot the im
portance of national reputation to luficr so indeli
ble a stigma to be fixed on their character,as would
be theconfequence of annihilating the public debt
by law. The enemies of the funding fyltsm know
this; and therefore, whatever they may pretend
to the contrary, [peculation in a acbt tiiey arc cou*
vinced mull and will t>e paid, is their ol>j< ckiuop-
tiie meaiurco ot the govei nuicnt. IHe vnly

It is to the honor of the Supreme Executive,

of them are persons who were lutferei s in the cause
of freedom, and in the general ca'amities which
overwhelmed the countiy previous to the happy
change etfe&ed by the government, others mighc
