Covi'iutS from tht Gazette oj tie aqth ulf.
BY the extracts from Mr. jerterfon's letters
lately--publifhed, his sentiments on the con
stitution have been onbofofned to his country
men. The circumstances under which they
were written, already noticed, furnifli the ino(l
fatisfaftory demonstration they were the genu
ine dictates of his heart. That they became
at the time, the fubjeft of public discussion,
must have given him surprise ; but that they
Should navy be resorted to for the purpose of cri
mination, even if his judgment, upon that great
fubjeft, had wandered from a found decision, is
flill more extraordinary. They are however|
fully before tlie public, and whether they de
fierve commendation or cehfure, his feliow-ci
tizens will determine for themselves.
If the political querist fought, as an object of
curious fpedilation, a more concise and sum
mary exposition of them, I am persuaded he
would concur with me in the following, found
ed on these extracts. u That he had become
sensible the wife and-happy ciire&ion of the as-
of his country -required some gr*at change
in her political friftitution? t arid wljon he si -ft
saw the constitution, the refnlt of those able
and experienced councils, to whose care the
modification had been committed, he consider
ed it like all other human productions, contain
ing much good, but not without a confiderabie
alloy of evil. That he prized its good quali
ties too high to urge any step that po&ibly
tend to hazard the system, and therefore wilhed
its immediate adoption hy nine States and esta
blishment as a .government. That he wished
the four other States to hold out, and thereby
form on each fide ar\ independent head, between
whom the necessary amendments might be ami
cably adjuftedi That afterwards and for the
fake of greater fafety, confiding in the virtues
and patriotism of his countrymen, he even ad
vised amendments in the mode proposed by the
instrument itfeif.*
Let the American shew the paffkge in these
or any other letters written by him, which
fhouJd give offence to the most active republican
supporter of the conftitutioq, in that or any
fubfequertt stage : which denounces him the foe
to good government, the friend to anarchy and
licentioufncf>. Let him point out the Ibnti
raent whicn ns; not .rv-a great measure been
verified, by the President in his introductory
speech to ConVrefs, the fiibfequent acts of that
body, arid those of the feverai States. Unhap
pily for mankind the annals of nations prove,
tjiat persons in this station too often err in the
opposite extreme. That those who poifefs wealth J
and power, and even where tliefe gifts have
been conferred by the confidence and favor of:
their countrymen, are too apt to feel for them
selves a different interest, separate from, and
look with an eye of jealousy and scorn upon
those of their fellow men, tof whom the goods of
fortune have been difpenfeet*with a less liberal
hand. In this refpeft indeed the tone of cha
racter displayed in these letters may be deemed
in some measure peculiar to their author. Such
an unfeigned and benevolent regard for man
kind in all their classes ; such an anxious folici
tucle for their welfare, and vigilant attention
to their rights, are rarely to be found united in
any due person. With feeling*; and sentiments
like these, if I miftakenot the man, the felfifh,
narrow, and vam-afpiHng; heart of the Ameri
can never glowed.
The charge then of hoftilitv to the govern
ment in that early stage, so far as it depended
on the secret operations of his mind, has been
i&ewri to be without foundation. His subse
quent condutt has beeil traced for further evi
dence of difafre&ion, and however light and
qontemptiMe the circumstances are on which it
rests, I will pursue it, the more fully to demon
strate the impurity of the motives which dic
tated the attack.
The freedom with Which he has spoken of
some public meafnre*, being a principal fervarit
in the executive department) has been relied
on as a circumstance of unequivocal proof ol
such hostility. The object and extent cf this
po lit ion perhaps I do not fully comprehend :
does the author mean, that a wifely framed go
vernment cannot in its administration adopt an
injudicious ard improper me afore ; or that a
an cannot be friendly to the one and dTap
prove of the other ? If tins is the idea and the
principle IhouM be recognizad, the field of en
quiry upon any future occasion would be much
ahr : d T ed, and the JaVv?- of all parties propor-

tionally fliminfbed. Let its Vf.vha.
they mignt, however repngnahf: to the autho
rity under which it a&ed, or fiibverfive of the
rights of those who made and for whose benefit
it should be administered, no controversy upon
these points could be luftained ; no critical
companion could be made, no line of partition
drawn between the one and the other. If thi~
fhoti'd be eftablilhed, the people of
these States would find themselves reduced to a
strange dilemma : the conftitutioo they had
adopted and planned with so much care, as the
boundary of a limited authority, would be con
fiderey as the absolute furiender of all their
rghts. By Intimating every poflible measure
which in the of tiii\e a venal and un
principled majority might carry, its a&s would
become more oppreilhe than those of any exist
ing tyranny, because its administration would,
be move daring;, under the delusion pra&iled on
the people, by seeming to relb on their/ufFrarge.
Or does the author mean that a p<*vfbii by ac
cepting an office in the executive deparjnent,
should lose in the fprritof the corps, the native
rights of a freeman ? that he fnould abandon hi.

countrymen reposed an high confidence, should
throw the weight of his character, into the scale,
to support a measure which in his conscience he
disapproved and in his station had opposed ?
that the members of the adininiftration fnould
form together a close and fccret combination,
into whose measures the profane eye of the pub
lic should in no instance pry ? If this is his idea
let it be avowed ; it involves a principle which
upon public considerations lhould be dlfcufled ;
for I consider it fnbverfive of those upon which
the government tj ilf was founded. That majk
of fejorecy adopted in arbitrary governments,
â¢or the most appreflive purposes, and which by
some good men has been deemed neceflary to
cover executive operations, has in most in
flances when applied to us been over-rated.
Few cases only and those purely executive, atad
for which the chieftain himlelf should be held res
ponsible, can require it. In general, if it doe;
not cover grofsand fliameful malversations, and
wjiiph should be exposed for wholefotne correc
t.ou to the public view, the most: favorable light
in which it can be held, is that of an empty, fri
volous,and pageant ceremonial of office. Rut it
may be positively affirmed that whenever if in
rerfores with the spirit of responsibility; the life
and foul of republican government, its tenden
cy is vicious, and should be abandoned. So fa 1 "
then from deeming him ceHl'urable, for the free
dom of his discourse upon public measures, to
the extent that I am persuaded he has carried
it, I honor and refpeft him for it. It marks a
firm and virtuous independence of character,
which allures me I may still confide in him with
fafety. The principles he acknowledges, and
the language he ufe.s, are his own ; not formed
upon those of the majority of the corps to which
he may occasionally belong : they are the fame
I know that be pofTefTed before he commenced
the career of public trust.
FROM THE SOUTH CAROLINA GAZETTE,
(PRINTED AT COJLUMBIA.)
A co-rrrfpondevt, who tit eh mode a tour acr'ojs the Ca
rolina f and Georgia, has obliged vi'tvith the follow
ing observations, taken down at Salem, the principal
Moravian town in North-Carolina.
THE most elegant afpeÂ£t of this place is exhibit-:
ed to the traveller approaching it from the
Weft jlong the heighths which arise between Salem
and Shoeber's paper mill. While in triii point of
view the town presents to the eye fifty chimncx
tops. This pUce, though not incorporated by
law, is well guarded against the fatal effe&s ot
firr. A nightly watch is fipported for tne pur
pose from ten o*clrtck to four.
Yon will be treated with no rudcnefs by the
Moravians. They never play tricks of waggery
unoo travellers. It fcemsto afford their principal
men pleasure to walk with vou.converfe with voo,
Ihew you the several bulineifes which are conduc
ed amongst them, and explain to you the philofo
phica4 principles of their machines; and all this
withont discovering the slightest symptom ot jea
loufv, impatience, or relerve.
They waste no flatteries nor congees upon you.
They will not ask you to eat, or dunk ,or smoke,
or play with them. They afFect no compliments ;
and yet you (hall feel yourfelf treated with much
attention and civility. Were the Moravians to
keep open doors and free tables, fpunger? would
make a prey of them, and the inn would be rob
bed of its buftnefs and support.
Their young women collect and worflup very
early in the morning, A Piano Forte enlivens
their devotions. About the fame time their young
men arc employed in the fame manner. The
whole community worlhip together ia the ecenirtg
âmen and womenâold and yodng âstrangers
and fcrvanta. Here the organ is put in blast to
accompany their Hallelujahs !
There are some hopes that the Moravians will
found a new fettlemcnt ir. the next, if not the cur
rent year, on the waters of Long Canes in South
Carolina, Their handicrafts mull make them
eminently uleful to a country so remote from the,
ocean. Moravian establishments, at proper inter
vals,through the interior parts of the United States,
must operate as nurseries for the Republican Vir
tues of Industry, Economy, Tempcrancr and sys
tematic Hah'ts of Life.

THE REPUBLICAN.âNo. 111.
WHATEVER efFect the preceding obser
vations may have made, the reader Hi!'
believes that the provision for the public debt
has increased the number of the friends and sup
porters of tlie government. 7 here is no doubt j
thole who hold the paper will lie perl'uaded that!
their property would fall with the government |
Their interest is conne&ed with the preserva
tion of the law*. If this be the corrupt influ
ence which is pretended to have arisen with the
j funding law, no friend of the union will hesitate
to avow it. For it may be demanded, what
property would be fafe if the government fhonld
j fall ? The torrent of a revolution sweeps every
I thing away, and our cla?nourers may expect to
! pick up something valuable adrift. Every man
who has property will'"therefore deem it his in
terest, as well as his duty, topreferve the la"ws,
which are topreferve him and his poflefTions.
The funded (tock is the mod easily dcftroyed at
a blow--âbut when the work of fucli xaonftrous
iniquity fiiall begin, whst right or what pofTef
<7ou will be fafe, till t:'.e rage or the avarice of
"be perpetrators fiiafl be Weary or ftttsfied?
The corrupt influence complained of by the
party-writers, is therefore the influence of pro
perty. Those who have nothing, ard whole
principles are as light as their purses, talk of a
revolution as of a holiday.
Bad imprefijons are not unfrequently made
Hv negle&i ng to trace what we hear to its prin
ciples. We ilia!! not on reflection much
force to the suggestion thatCongrefs has a secret
influence that can neither be explained nor re
fitted. Admitting the whole tale to be true, as
its inventers have told it. V/hat is this mighty
influence that operates unseen like magic? Car.
a few creditors govern a nation ? They tell us
they are fewâand this is the burden of their
fongâfor it would deftrov their argument to
make them|Very numerous. They tell us too
the/ are imprudently ostentatious, generallyj
worthless and odious. Their influence, accord
ing to the party writers, must therefore be very
little.
How much then will tliefe men, so few and
so odious, weigh against the multitude of in
dependent freemen ?
But if these public creditors are governed by
ilitereft only, we have the means of judging how
their influence will be used : their interest will
lead them to preserve public order, but not to
invade equal liberty. The laws protest their
property. They have only to maintain the
laws. They have something to pre/erve, but
nothing tc> gain. If a despot therefore should
arise, would he find the holders of the public
debt his friends ? Certainly not. The change
of government would (hake their funds. Thty
of all men could compute the loss of liberty in
pound-, fhillJngs and pence. It is mai>ifeltly
their interest to have the administration con
ducted on popular and reasonable principles :
for any opposition to the laws, or even any strong
symptoms of difcbntent, would alarm their fears
and reduce the value of their stock.
The public creditors are bound to support li
berty by all the duties which bind other citi
zens. Besides which, their property is made
to depend upon its being supported. If they ast:
a part the most purely felfifh, they will oppofe l
the oppreilions of the government, and the in
lurre&ions of the multitude. They will hate
confnfion, but they will love equal liberty.
TwV will keep things as they are, and refill
chaiige.
It has already been remarked, that general
laws are favorable to equal liberty, by placing
the rich and poor impartially on a footing. It
may be added, that whiie such Jaws are main
tai iedj great men cannot rife up to re
publican equality.
In the eye of Jaw, all citizens have equal
rights. Carry the Jaws ftri&ly into execution,
and they will enjoy them with equal security.
But let down the laws, and tfce natural distinc
tions among men, in point of property and know
ledge, find room to operate without restraint.
The citizens are no longer equal. The mar
who has a great plantation, and many fiaves
and dependents, riles high above the common
level. He seizes a portion of that supreme au
thority which has been wrested from the laws,
or more properly from the whole people. The
part he thinks fit to espouse, is followed by all
the uiftrict over which he reigns, as a petty
king. We, in America, have known the laws
-so feeble, that the authority of individuals of
great influence seemed to be <he only means of
preventing the evils of exfreme anarchy. It
will not be said that this influence was not fre
quently used, in the times alluded to, virtuous
ly, and even in conformity with the general
sense of the people. But power is of:en well
used, but rarely laid down with good will. As
the stable and equal laws o r the union rose, the
influence of great men, and leaders of parties
declined. The people how?ver may be said to
have riifen in authority with the laws. The
laws of Congrcfs treat the citizens, whether
rich or poor, with equal favor. ThoJe who are
properly to be called great men, because in un
settled times they had more power than their
neighbors, have seen with no linall ir.ortifka

" Every liratagem has been em
ployed to excite the fury of the rab
ble again ft the Royal Family, and to
bring them to the fcÂ«ffold. For this
pnrpofe, not only hand bills are in

editors of the Jacobin Journals invent
the 1110 ft grol's calumnies ; which they
know limit remain uncontradicted, as
the Gazettes in the opposite iwerelt
have been prohibited to bepubliihed.
In one of these papers of yelterday,
written by the execrable Gorfas, a let
ter is publiihed, which he fays was
found in the Queen's writing-delk at
ihe time the palace was pillaged,from
her Majesty to the Aultrian Minilter
at Bruflels, recommending a long lift
of prolcribed friends to the royal
call fe, to his particular favor, She
is therein made to writeâhow much
they are entitled to his protection,
from the services they have done her 1
and the King, and that ihe hopes the i
time draws nigh, when ihe shall be a- j
ble to reward all her friends ; âthat ,
(he looks forward with a pleasing :
hope to the time when the Duke of
Brunfwick enters Paris.

Jinittee, which nominates commiflion

| As loon as the news of the late com
motions at Paris reached Rouen, the
department fitting there came to a
resolution. That they had taken a fo
!emn oath to be faithfuf to the nati
on, the law, and the Xing ; thar they
had devoted their lives and fortunes
to the constitution ; that the present
legislative aflembly had no power to
alter one tittle of that confticution ;
and that they would neither obey,
nor cause to be executed, any decree
not fan<ftioned by the King. This is
expected to be the cafe with many o
ither departments.
' By the mention of the Prince de
Poix in the National Aflembly on Sun
day, as one of the persons having ac
cess to the King without leave, it ap
pears that the report of his having
fallen a vicftim to the infurretftionsof
Friday last was erroneous.
Bickeftaff, the author of Love in a

mendicant indigence. A donation
of half a guinea from one who had
known him in better days, was re

The deplorable (fate of France, at

deposed by a decree of the National
Aflemblyâand both King ami Queen,
with their family, obliged to lhÂ«lrer
themselves in this very Aflembly,
from the lawless fury of the Parisian
populace. The guards of the palace
butchered before ihe threshold, and
the palace rifled by the mobâan ar

headed by the brave and warlike, but
implacable Duke of Brunfwick, de

PARIS, August 1 J
M MERLIN announced to the As
. fembly, that the Pruftian and
Austrian armies had entered the de
partments of Moselle, and that they
had made thcmffcfves matters of the
a<lvanced pods of Sierck and Rode
mack.
This circuinftance, he added, ought
uot to intimidate the French nation,
but it ought to arouse thein so as 10
adopt a very important tnciafure : He
therefore moved, " That the relati
ons, the wives, and the children of
the etnigrants, should, wiih Louis
XVI. be reserved as guarantees for
the events of the war."
It was accordingly resolved by the
Aflemb'iy, that they (hould be detain
ed as hollages within the limits of
their refpe&ive municipalities.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
August 18.
M. Cabot read a letter from Mau
beuge, from which it appeared that
the foldicrs approved of the proceed
ings of tiie Assembly, and thac they
bad refitted the attempts made by
Dillon, Lauieth, and La Noue, to ex
cite them to oppose tiie Aliembly.â
To the infinuacions of those Generals
they replied, " that their true poin
of rallying was, and always wouli
be, the National Aflembly, and tha
they considered Louis XVI. as a per
juved wretch and a traitor !"â" M
Lameth in vain attempted (said th<
writer of the letter) to gain over ;
few regiments. In vain did he lei
them that 15,00Â® Auftrians were rea
dy to fall upon tliem. The troop
flew to arms, and ordered their inuli
to play Ca ira !!"
Sunday, Auguit 19.
The AHembly were occupied for
alnioft two hours in reading letters
and addrefles, all approving of the
decree for suspending the King.
The Departinetu-of Guai c'e inform
ed the Aflembly, thru they had caused
the refractory Prftfts to be,exported,
and that tbeyoonfideredthia measure
as tending...tarty much to preferre
public tranquility.
The Aflembly then ordered the
Committee of Legislation to prepare
the plan of a decree for transporting
all the refractory priests out of the
kingdom.
Some private letters from Marshal
Luckner were read, which announced
that he had again taken the oath of
fidelity, and profefled his attachment
to the public eaufe. In a paragraph
of one of these letters, the Marflial
exprefl'es himfelf thus :
" Though the Executive Power be
suspended, I hope I {hall not be or
dered to retire. Had 1 not been or
dered to withdraw from Courtray,
I would, in a little tiqie, have rettor
ed liberty to the Belgians."
LA FAYETTE ACCUSED.
Some soldiers of the army of M. la
Fayette being admitted to the bar,
informed the Aflembly that they were
obliged to make their escape through
a wood to avoid being seduced by their
chiefs, and that they had come to Pa
ris to learn tlie truth refpetfiing the
events of the ioth. Tliey said, that
M. Veneur had written to the batta
lions, in the natne of M. la Fayetie,
to the following purport .
"Soldiers! your confiitution-has
been annihilated ! Seditious men have
filled the measures of their crimes.â
They have caused the Swiss soldiers,
and the comiiiandandant of the Na
tional Guards, to be aflalGnated.â
Wit h fwerds in their hands they have
.compelled the Legif.ative body to de
cree the fufpenfion'of the King. Sol
diers clioofe between ths King and
Petion."
They added that M. La Fayette
â¢wished to make thetn sign a paper
written in the fame (train, and re
queued that the would pre
vent the perfidious design of this Ge
neral.
M. Merlin presented fifty different
pieces to support their accusation.
Two private letters, and in parti
cular one from the Coumiiffioners
sent to the army, being adduced to corroborate
tnefe charges, (he Ailcmbly immediately palled
the following
DECKEL qv accusation AGAINST M. DE LA
FAY Â£T'l Jr.
1. It appears to this AflVmbly that there; isjufl
ground for accft&uon against M. de la Fayette,
heretofore Commander of the armyot the North.
2. The Executive Power lhall iu the nioit ex
peditious manner poflible, put the present decree
into t xecution ; and all authorities, alt
citizens, and all foldters, are hereby enjoined, by
every means in their power, to secure his person.
3. The Atfembly forbids the army of the north
any longer to acknowledge him as Geneial, or to
obey his orders ; and lti iÂ£tiy enjoin thdi mo person
whatsoever shall luinith any thing for the troops,
ar pay any f'noiity for their use, but by the orders
of M. Dumourier.
We fhull be imjprmed before-hand of the part
chat the Aflcmbly -will take on the question of the
forfeiture ; tor, in the intermediate time, they are

LONDON, August 20.
The people at Havic-de-Grace, and from thence
;o Rouen, appear to be pretty equally divided be
tween the Kmg and the enemu s of monarchy.
The letters trom Paris brought by ths last mail,
mention that every thing in tiiat city is in a state
of the gieateft ferment and confufion, that every
hour perl'ons of refpe&ability ate airelied, and
that no one thinks himlclf late ; and that all who
can get awny are doing it as tall as poflible.
There are one hundred, ana thirty persons in
pr'.fon for the bufincU of the xÂ®ih ; there is a very
great probability that they will all be put to death,
.is no doubt they will al l be found guilty ofâfide
lity to,the King. The executions are to take place
m the square ot the Caroulal over against the Pa
lace. Among the viÂ£hms, aie several noblemen
of this country, and the flower of the Swiss nobi
lity, many of the late mimfti ts, and M. la Porte,
the keeper of the privy purse. The trials com
mence this day.
A letter from Oft' nd, dated 22d inft. received

Extract of a letter from Cape-Francois, Sept. 17.
u The fleet arrived this day at twelve o'clock,
the new General (M. Defparbes) dined on board
the Eole, man ot war. The troops were under
arms, in order to receive him : at 4 o'clock, he
sent word that he would not land until morning.
" At half after five o'clock, however, he
landed, and his landing was announced by the
firing of cannon. The proceflion was dispersed,
this was what he wished to avoid. He went
to M. Blanchelande's, who met hiin at the
Champ de Mars. After resting tor half an
hour, we all went to the Colonial Aflembly, the
the President, M. Danfy, exprelled his regret,
that the intended ceremony had not taken place
on his arrival, and invited him for the next
day to a feaft with the aflembly and civil com
| miflioners. M. Defparbes answered, that he
would not hear of any feafts or ceremonies, that
he was c6me to save the Colony, and that he
had more serious business to <lo than receiving
or igivtertainmeÃts; upon jthi* he walked
olf an>imt the plaudits of a numerous gallery,
conf]fting,chiefly of the niofj reputable citizens,

are 260 dfragdons, of the Regiment of Orleans.
ii Ths fame letter relates, that the Negroes

It was the policy of the ancient common
wealths, by public games and feftivals, and by
various devices, to multiply and strengthen the
ties which bind men to society. The fine arts
were encouraged by the public, chiefly with the
view of foftering the enthuliafm of the citizens
for their country. It is surely better to bind
men's hearts than their hands, to engage their
best feelings for a government, rather than to
awe their fears into obedience. Yetfome men.
pretending to be philosophers, wiser than the
ancients, and colder than nature made them,
aHTetffc to dread the influence of opinion in favor
of a popular authority. They fear that a go
vernment, in all its branches purely represen
tative, will poflefs in too great a degree the
Â£;entleft of all powerâthe power of doing good,
exercjfed in a manner to gain the affections of
the people. Surely these men would not re
commend a government as more fafe, which
iliould make itfelf justly odious by violating
their rights, and debasing itfelf below the degree
of excellence in which every good citixen de
lights to contemplate the image of his country.
The people however are told to watch, to fuf-
and almost to fear and hate a government
which has done justice to individuals. They
tell us that Congress is more to be feared for
having done justiceâthose whose threatened
rights have been spared, will be grateful, and
feel disposed to support government. This is
the corrupt and dangerous influence which they
tell you is creatcd, and conjured up aÂ£aiuft liber
ty. Is the world co.ne to such a pass as not to
be shocked when such words are applied to such
a purpose ? Is it pofllble in this enlightened age,
that a government can be chargcd as criminal,
and the people roi)led with alarm, because the
rights of tfie public creditors have been deemed
facrej? The fame writers who reprobate the
fhndiog a&, because it attaches men to fociet)
by tba intereil and sentiment, abhor ftil:
more a Handing aimed force. They would
support the authority of the people thro' their
rulers, neither by the strength of* arms nor of
opinions. The consequence is easily drawnâ
they would not have it supported at all. Time
is against the government, for it is new. Ar
mies it has none. Rivals it has manyâene
mies more, some of its own houfeholdâlt has
scorned the aid offuperftitionâWithout nobles,
without a politicalpriefthood, its life is in every
rn'an's handâlt isfupreme, yet an hoftagewith
the peopleâWho are they that would incite
them to destroy it? Not the friends of liberty.
The wife and virtuous citizens are protected by
government, but in turn they protect it. They
are the keepers of a sacred depofitâfor a re
public io purely ele&ive as ours is, rests on opi
nion. When therefore desperate men attempt
to poison the public mind, it becomes the men
of worth to discharge their trust. They are
bound to resist in themselves and others thefirft
iinpulfes of passion. The sober reflection of the
public seldom errs, and as seldom fails at last to
govern the government. It becomes that so
ber pfiblic to judge whether the tendency of the
late calumnies on men and measures be to cor
rect what is wrong, or to throw down all the
fences of liberty and order.

Blind and exceflive praise of-the government
and its measures cannot be expected to serve
any cause. Good men will he disgusted and
cunning men will find grounds for fufp'cion.
But a rational exposition of the principles of a
law and an earnest and frequent appeal to the
sober sense of the citizens on the fitnefs of those
principles and the ufeful tendency of the law, is
always a proper conduct for those to observe
who wish to fee good order maintained.âlt is
COMMUNICATIONS.
doubly necessary to do it when men who wilfully
or ijfnorantly nufripreteut; the delign of a law,
and of thole who framed it, are bulily at work
to kindle (editionâivlitn they deny facts that
all the world may lee with their eyes, and tell
the people in the bo lorn of peace and in the very
lap of picnty, that the laws of Congress are op
iprellivo and ruinous, that the excile, funding,
and bank laws ought to be repealed, and even
refilledâfor their doctrines cannot be admitted
without juftifying the refinance of the laws j
truly in such a cafe it is proper to vindicate the
conduct of Congressâto point out the reasons
of thole laws, to refute the groundsels objec
tions a jainft them, tn appeal to experi
ence, the best judge of men and their
to evince the wiftlom of thole laws by the good
fruits they hai e yielded to the body of the na
tion. Theje tail be nodifputeon the propriety
of doing this olten and with foine degree of
force and earnestness, suited to the fcnle of, the
inifchief of stirring up the people against their
own lawsâyet thole who ineelfantly write a
gainst the excise, bank and fnnriing acts, be flow
foul names on those who vindicate those mea
sures. It seems as if the antidote Ihould be sent
after the poison. The soberest attempt to ihew
by facts the uses of a law is denominated puff
ing ; which by the way is fafer than to deny
the fatts which stare them in the face. Advi
sing the people to refpeft the laws and maintain
good order is called lervile flattery of men in
power, fycophantilh, &c. The courtâthat is
to fay, the lervants of a free people are to be
llandered toVnaniifeft the spirit of freemen and
thole who approve their conduit are base de

are the impudent arts which are using to stir
up mifchief.

we lay in darkness, coniulion, difgiace and dis
tress, which (had 11 continued) was only " the be
ginning of for-row** to us and our poflenty â
whereas now it is the admiration of all intelligent
unprejudiced men in ihe woild who have heard
of it ; and the envy of moll nations, even of those
who hsve not the virtue, power 01 itfoluiion to
iollowoui example. What thofc gruinbletomans
.jmongit ourselves have in view, I know not ; but
however fair their pretention* may be, or how
ever clamorous, their secret views aie ftiongly,
and 1 am afraid justly fufpittcd, by the moie en
lightened and honeit pÂ«Â«rt of the inhabitants of
these ftalv-s, of not being friendly to the pubJic
peace. Perhaps some may want to Rfh in tiou,-
bled waters, even if their country thould pcrilh
in the ilotm. Ii may be envy with others.
From all I can learn, the chief and other offi
cers ot gdvernment were men of the firft charac
ters for probity, intelligence and patnotifm, and
underwent much fatigue and hcait conoding anx
iety in the field of danger and d.cath, rifquing their
all to obtain for this vow happy country, tiec
dom from a most grievous yoke, which neither
we nor our pofteriiy would have been able to
bear.
I have Been at pains to enquire, and from all I
can learn, most or all ibe m< mbcrs of the legisla
tive body, iri both houses, were men of the iiift
characters lor integrity, patrioiifm and intelli
gence, uÂ» the Hates from Whence tiny came : those
!of then pw n vicinity weie ctiliitnly the best
judges of thelr chatfc&erj> ; they must leel the good
or evil of the laws ihey make, more than you or
I, or any others of lei's property, or fewer connex
ions or dependants than thtmfelves. Nothing but
perverse blindnef*, or woife, can hinder any man
from feeing aDd owning thjs ; and what poflib!c
motive could they have lor enabling laws (in the
confcquences ot which themselves and their nu
merous families and connexion's ar< so deeply con
cerned) which in their hear,: and confritnee they
did not thit k to be (upon the whole) best for the
whote family of this great and giowing empire ?
I cannot help fufpeÂ£ting that amongn those un
reasonable enemies to the prelect coflft
there are a few who wilh us again under the Brj_
ti fh yoke, or are inimical to the credit, the glory |
ihe pcace and prosperity of those United States.

Mr. Fenno,
BY this day's Mail I am informed, that the
letter containing 6 per ccnt. Stock addrcfl
ed to me from Bolton, which in a letter of i6tli
ult. was said to be by Post, was not put into the
Poll-Office, but forwarded by a private hand te
New-York, where it was loji. It is but justice due
to the Poll-Office department to make this
matter public,as groundless suspicions may have
arisen in consequence thereof. It is very un
fortunate at this time, that such an error should
be committed, as limilar reports have prevail
ed and in many instances with as little founda
tion.
