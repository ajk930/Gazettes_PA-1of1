FROM TBOMAS's MASSACHUSETTS SPY.
For much it boots which way you train your boy,'*
AMONG the many dirc&ions and rules which have been li
berally prescribed for the well educaiing of children and
youth, none has been oftener repeated, or more strongly inculcat
Â«d than this, That they Ihould be carefully guarded from bad ex
am pies, and encouraged and led on in the right way by those that,
are good. Children are prone to imitaiion, and form themfelvcs
by means of it. They immediately adopt the language they heai
uttered, and the attions they fee performed. Hence, in all trea
ties, in all methods, in all schools, of genteel education, it is an
invariable maxim, to keep children, as much as possible, our of the
company of low and mean people, and especially of fcrvants left
tJieir manners and sentiments Ihould be tainted with any thing
that is low, vulgar and mean. The wisdom of this rule has been
universally acknowledged, and the advantage of it in*ariably ex
perienced, wherever regarded. But by some observations I hav
made of late, 1 have been led to conclude, that the rule iÂ« pretty
much laid aside, 1.1 some ot those ftaus, families and clafl"e< that
ought to know and obserVe the rules of good breeding and polite
nets; or, that the tables are now turned; that language and ac
tions, which none butt he Uferfort were supposed capable of, may
fce now learned of some wno call themselves the better lor: â¢ and
that those things which heretofore were looked upon as degrading
and fcandaloiis, and against which children and youih we're care
fully warned and guarded, are now considered as manlv and
genteel. , 7
J have a little Ton whom I have wiftied to be brought up both
genteelly and virtuously, aud always supposed that these were per
teaiy confident ; nijr, that virtue was cffential to the character of
a gentleman ; and that, to be well bred, he mull neither he Vulgar
nor vicious. I therefore cautiously retrained him from mixing
with pcrfons of a mean education, and with those whose occupa
tion was low and servile, whose language ts apt to be fcurnlous
and profane, and whose manner of fpcaking and behaviour would
be degrading and contemptible in a gentleman.
With a view to the improvement of my boy, as well as my own
gratification, X made several exen/fions with him the lad year and
the lad season, through the mod populous counties in this date,
and through some of the neighbouring dates, exciting his ambition
toobferve and imita-e the manners and language of those who a j
peared to be tafliionable and genteel, not doubting but such guides
would be fafe, considering their education and advantages, and
that they would lead him in the way in which he should go. R u t
before I got home from my last journey, I found to hly mortifica
tion, that, through my ignorance of modern improvements in the
iafhionable world, I had carried my son to a wrong ichooj, it 1
meant to preserve the purity of his language, ideas' and morals.
ros i e began to mow high spirit and resentment at fmaTl provoca
tions; to hludei and ilorrtV at the servants ; to fwetfr when in a
palfion, and sometimes in good humour; he would blackguard to
<ii fplay his wit, and play mischievous pranks to (hew his fun.
When I reproved him for his indecent and ungentiemanJike be
haviour, he replied that he had carefully followed my directions;
that he had learned nothing of the lower fort of people; that he
had spoken and done nothing but what he had heard and seen in
those families into which I hnd introduced him. I was con
ounded and fil'enced, knowing that he /poke the truth, having
been myfelf eye and car witness to the fame. . In some families
tie mailer would seldom speak to the servants, especially when he
was out of temper, without oaths, taunts, and leproaches. The
*ons would do the fame, and often intermix.their chcerful talk
With unnatural and dreadful profanity.âl heard of a man in the
neighbouihood of my lodgings who was engaged in an impoitant
undertaking, hich required skill arid abilities, as well as fidelity.
I had thecuriofitv to 'ee him while in the execution of his trust.
J Judged that every man who was employed, by persons of the
nrft chara&er, in matters of great and extensive conlequence to the
public, if he was equal to the undertaking, mud have manners and
address equal to his Nation, and to his skill in his employment;
2nd that his attendants, being awed by his manly deportment,
would behave, ai lead, with decency. But what was my surprise
when he replied to some of my moded inquiries in the roughed
language, and nothing was to be heard among his attendants but
t c fouled oaths! I soon made my escape from such company, and
urried with my son to my lodprings. When I returned to the
lnn > I found a number of people collected, daring and grinning,
Tound a handsome carriage; and soon heard paflionate exprcfEons
and profane oaths delivered in a haughty tone. Upon inquiry I
was told that ?he well drelfcd man who was raving and {wearing
at the driver, for some trivijl accident, or failure, was ,
I will not tell who he was; but I should not have been more
* onilhed, it I had heard imprecations and scurrility from the
mouth of a Judge, or even a Member o JCongrefs. It immediately
rouÂ»ht to my mind an ex predion v\ nich I heard from a chaplain
?I if w ht'n I was a boyâ" What honour can there be in
elching out oaths, when the mcanrjl fcnundrel can do the fame ?"

Saturday, October 8,
aftly eqmdiftant from the northern and southern extremities o<
the Union, and nearly so from the Atlantic to Fort-Pitt, upon the
belt navigation, and in the midst of the richest commercial terri
tory in America, commanding the moftexteofive internal refour
â  ces > 18 b Y far <he most eligible situation for the residence ot Con
) ; and as there is no doubt of it, being pressed forward, by
. the public-fpmted enterpnfe of the people ot these United States
. and by foreigners, it will grow up with a de get* of rapidity hi.
t, >wto unparalleled in the annals of cities, aud will soon become
} tnc admiration and delight of the world.
The plan of this city, agreeably to the directions of the Prefi
k 7,', o!<ed States " was defi K ne <l. and drawn, by, he cele
brated Major i.'Enfant ;and is an inconceivable improvemem
upon all other cities in the world, combining not only conven
ience, regularity, elegance of profpeft, and a free circulation of
air but every thing grand and beautiful, that can possibly be in
troduced ,nto a cityâAs the plan of this elegant city will be
pubhfhed early in next month, a particular description of it here
would neither be poflible nor necessary : A few sentences, on
that fubjeft, must therefore fuflice.
The streets, in general, run due north and south, and east and
welt, forming rcSangular fquarej._The area for the Congress-
House, is situated upon the most beautiful eminence, little more
than a mile from the Eaftem-Branch, and not much more from
thePatowmac ; commanding a full aud complete view of every
part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country
around. The President's Hovse will (land upon a rising
ground, not far from the banks of the Patowmac, possessing a de
lightful water profpeft, together with a commandingview of the
Congress-House, and most of the material parts of the city. The
Houjes for the great Departments of State, the Supreme Cour:-
Mouse and Judiciary-Offices, the National Bank, the General
Exchange, and the several Market-Houses, with a variety of other
public buildings, are all arranged with equal propriety,judgment
and taste. in such situations as, in practice, will be found the most
convenient and proper.âDue south from the President's House,
and due weft from the Congress tfoufe, run two great Pleasure-
Parks, or Malls, which interfeft a rid terminate upon the banks of
the Palowmac, and are ornamented at the firies with a variety of
public gardens and elegant buildings, interspersed
through the city, where the most material streets cross, in the most
important situations, aie a variety of open areas, formed in various
regurarfiguies, which in great cities are extremely ufcful and or
namental.â Fifteen ot the best of these dress may be appropriated
IO the different States ctvmpofing the Union, not only: to "bear
their relpedive patties, but as proper places for them tqereft sta
tues, obelilks or columns, to the memory of their favorite heroes
or ftatelYnen ; providing they contribute towards the improve
ment of the lots around these areas, in (uch manner as may be a
greed upon.âFrom ih* Congref.-Hotife, the President's Houfc.
and fame of the other important areas in the city, run tranlverfe
avenues, or diagonal streets, from one material objfft to another,
which not only produce a variety of charming profpefts, and fa
cilitate the communication through the city, but temoyethat io-
Cpid sameness,- that renders Philadelphia and Charleilpn uuplea
fing.âThffe great leading (trfffs are all 160 feet wide, including
a brick pavement of 10 feet, and a gravel walk of go feet planted
with trees, on each fide; which will leave 80 feet of paved street
for carriages.âThe reft of the streets, are in gensral, 130 and no
feet wide, and are now mostly run out upon true principles, from
celestial oljfervaiions, by thf Geographer-General of the United
Stales, whose astronomical knowledge, and fcientific talents, are
so univtrfally known and admired
The founding of this city, in furh an eligible fltuation, upon
such a. liberal and elegant plan, will, by fumre be
confidejed as one of the mull important tranfa&ions of the pre
sent President of the United States ; while its name will keep frefh
in mind, 10 the end of time, the mjiiy important fervicet he has
rendered hiscountry.
Among the many fortunate circumstances which have attended
this country, during the present administration in government, the
residence of Major l'Enfant in America, at this time, may be con
fide red as one of the moll material.âThe plan he has now pro
duced, and which is happily adopted, exhibits such striking pi oofs
of an exalted genius, elegance of taste, extensive imagination and
comprehension, as will not only produce amazement in Europe,
but meet the admiration ot all luture ages ; having theiein so hap
pily combined ihe beauties ot situation with general convenience
and, at the fame time, effectually guarded against thofc inconven
iences which arise in other great cities.
The public buildings, now planned by this great engineer and
archited, and carrying on under his direction, will befuperbano
elegant, and such as will do honor to the capital of a great and
prolperous empire; while,fortunately, it is not in the power of
Congress to interfeie with the funds obtained for those public
works ; the whole being from private grants of individual State*
and citizens.
It mutt, no doubt, be admitted, that Congress have power, even
at their next feflion, to repeal the present law, by which they arc
obliged to remove to the city of Washi NCTON,at the time there-
in mentioned ; but they have no power to fay that, from the prefeni
tunds, certain houses (hall not be erected, or that the proprietor
shall not proceed in building the city : Hence, therefore, it wi];
remain, at any future period, with Congress, to choose their per.
mafient residence, in the moil central situation. Here it may \ c
proper to observe, that, agreeably to the new constitution of the
Union,the States of Virginia and Maryland surrendered a diftri6l
of territory, which Congress have, by law, accepted of That, a
greeably to the fame law of Congress, these two States have made
a grant of money, for the public buildings, part of which is now
a&ually paid and expendedâThat, in consequence of the fame
law, a large tract of land is granted, by a number of individuals ;
which land is now cut up into a city, and, belore the meeting of
Congress, will, in part, be fold to a variety of people throughou
the Union.âThe repeal of a law, therefore, so groisly to violate
pub'ic and private faith, would not be mentioned in a Congress
of fiends imt in Pandemonium ; far less in the general legifLturt
of these United Stares, whose tenacious adherence to uublic faith
prevented their altering t'nefunding-law last feflion when proposed.
With regard to the fufficiency of the funds, now obtained, so?
the pubJic purposes of this new city, it will, in a great measure,
depend upon the management of the sale of the lots ceded to th<
public. If they are fold off gradually, as money maybe wanted
to thole who will attually improve thein in a reasonable time, thÂ«
fund will be produ&ive, far exceeding the mod fangume calcula-
tions that have been made upon it âFor the lots remaining 01,
will rife in value, in proportion to tbe growth and namr*
advantages of the city, as is evidcut in the mod trifling town and
village in America.

O N DON, Augufl 4.
The King of Sweden has difTuantled all the
fortifications eretfted duringthe war, 011 tlie fron
tiers of Ruffian Finland ; a measure which In
dicates an early aiul permanent pacification in
the North, and may by Come politicians be fpp,
poled to look favorable to that Confederacy a
gainlt France, which has so long been spoken of.
The present combination of Kings again ft the
liberty of France plainly shews that their Ma
jesties want wisdom. If they were poflefled of
much penetration, they would know that it was
the interference of the French in the affairp of
America that firft made them pane for freedom
and that the soldiers of the German, Spanifli'
and other Princes, by now interfering in the af
fairs of France, may learn that they were noc
born to be slaves.
1 he putting a ftopto theprefs is an indication
that the establishment of peace is in a promising
train, but the cot tinnance of the bounties u>
sea nen rtews, that it is not yet accomplifted
I lie Paris letters of Fiiday do not even anti
cipate any thing with refpeift to the decision of
the Aflemhly on the great question refpetftine
the flight of the Royal Family. The only ru
mour with refpecft to the latter is, that as Toon
as the decrees on the conftitorion are completed
a digest of them is to be made up and offered to
'he King. The Monarch, on this oceafion, is ta
be allowed to remove to one *>f his country pa
laces, and there to frame his decision with alt
polhhle freedom. Jf he aflentshe is to be reftor

Such a decree, by rooting out the diftindhons np
which that illultrious body had been iiccl j it Â°' ne

The late declaration of the King of Spain, < -
gainlt the introduction into the Span,lh domini
ons of the political fanaucifm of the biench, by

Extracts from a Military Discourse, delivered by H.
H. Brackeuridge, to the Light Infantry Company
of Pittjburgh, Sept. 17, I 79 1 -
IN the Peloponnefian wars of Greece, when
the Lacedemonians, by order of the oracle, sent
-o Athens for a general, that difdainful and ri
val republic sent them Tyrtxus, a chaplain, lame
in his feet, diminutive in hisperfoli, and sent as
a bnrlefque, not as a general. What was the
eventÃy his discourses, which he compoted
in verse, he ronfed the Spartans to the noblest
ardor, and though not a soldier, or a general
himfelf he gave foul and animation to those that
were. An ii resistible enthusiasm was kindled by
his words ; the enemy were vanquiihed in every
battle ; and the Athenians too late were convin
ced of their error in furnifhing their rivals with
a leader so formidable.
Great is the power of speech..âWhat did not
Demosthenes do at a later age ? The Athenians,
after the Persian victories, had become luxurious
and effeminate. Yet even these did he rouse to
encounter the Macedonian phalanx. Well said
Philip of him, " I regard not the Theban foot,
or the Illyrian horse, so much as the lightning
of that orator." The Athenians were effemi
nate,, luxurious, and averse to war; yet at a An
gle adjuration of the orator, swearing by those
who fell at Marathon and Platxa, as in other
cases he would have sworn, by the immortal
Gods themselves, there was produced a delirium
of the brain, a madness of intellect, and an im
petuolity of valor. To warâto warâwas the
word and at the battle of Charonea, which
took place, it may be said to have been his voice
which rendered, for a long time dubious, a con
test for the liberties of Greece.
The Spartan discipline is well evinced from the
circumltance, of the soldier, who had his hand
lifted to strike a fallen enemy, yet, at that in
fant, a retreat founding, he withdraws his foot
and spares the blow. It is also related of the
troops of Cyrus, that on the march, a soldier re
ceiving a stroke on his cheek from foinething
thrown, yet turned not his head to fee from
whence it came.
As to the glory of a soldier it is the highed a
mongst mortals. We value eloquence and admire
wifdoin ; but the prowess of the soldier is fafci
nating to the mind, and we are affonifhed at his
intrepidity and boldness.
So high an opinion had the ancients of milita
rv Ikill and valor, that to one of thefeven worlds
of our system, they gave the name of Mars.
While he moves in his bright circle round the
fun, let every one remember that he is the fa
vorite of Venus, and not far distant from her
sphere : Venus the ftarof the morning, the har
binger of day ; and as she smiles upon Mars, so
may the fair ever smile upon those who draw
their swords in their defence.
The glory of the American soldier is pecu
liarly diltinguifhed. He fights for 110 despot.
He draws his sword at his own will, and goes in
to battle in a cause which is his own.
Particular legislators have laid the foundation
of other fyfteins : Moses amongst the Jews ; So
lon at Athens ; Lycurgus at Sparta, and Numa
Pompilius at Rome. The citizen of America has
himfelf delegated representatives, to devise forms
of government ; he has considered and tried
these forms, and has ordered them to be altered
and amended at his pleasure. He has been a
Solon, a Lycurgus, a Numa Pompilius for him
delf. In him therefore unites the double glory
of a legislator and a soldier. Happy people to
have been your'own lawgivers, and to harve
arms in your hands to guard those laws.

PORTLAND, (MaflT.) Sept. 23
On Wednesday last, two regiments of the mi r *
litia of this county were muttered at Falmouth,
for a review by Major General Goodwin, viz.â
Col. Cobb's and Col. Larrabee'sâThey made a
respectable appearance, and merit as well offi
cers as privates the approbation of their fellow
citizens ; âCapt. Bowman's Troop ofHorfe.from"
Gorham, appeared in the field, in uniform, for
the firfl timeâtheir appearance and perform
ance added much to the pleasure of the day,their
appearance was brilliant, and does honor to the
town from whence they cameâlt is a pleasing
circumstance to observe a disposition to promote
military knowledge reviving, encreifing, and
diffufing itfelf among all ranks of people in this
diltri<si.
FROM A CORRESPONDENT
While we read of the havoc among the inha
bitants of the Eastern hemisphere, by raging
wars and a more deltrudive pestilence. While
we consider the present (late of Europe, where
almolt every nation is involved, or to appearance
about to be involved in contention and disorder.
While we observe with horror the dreadful
tidings from the Weft-Indies; and, in short,
while we reflect on the troubles that.fnbfift in
almost every other part of the world, how ought:
our hearts to glow with gratitude to the Supreme
Being, for the bleflings we enjoy in this.âHere:
peace dwells within our walls : Health, plenty
and prosperity smile upon all our towns. âUn-
der the administration of a wife and efficient go
vernment, such a government as no other people
could ever boafl of, we enjoy the happiefr re
flections and the faireft profpetfts. What is in
the womb of time we cannot tellâlt is not for
mortals to know the defigtis of Providence, or
even to understand His ways. The present Itate
of the world fee ins to portend great events.
Great events have indeed already taken place
the present year, and are now btirfting forth, te
the astonishment of every reflecting mind. Oil
whatever secular principles they may be account
ed for, we ought to ascribe thein to the over-rul
ing hand of GOD. He did marvellous things a
mong the inhabitants of the earth in ancient
times, and is now performing wonders in our
days. What has been done for us of late years,
is a part of His great plan.
Americans ! call to mind the days of your
diltrefsâView your present happy situation ;
and bless him who hath delivered you from the
former, and eftabliftied von in the lattei wo
hath diftinguilhed you among the nations of the
earth : and while he fuffers dark clouds to over
spread them (perhaps, however, only to prepare
them for the enjoyment of resplendent days) i
crowning you with loving kindness. Ma e ""J
the heft "return you can, for his gooknefs, ana
he will give you continual cause to cleern you
selves a happy people.

RELIGION is the onlv foundation ot moralityâas the latter
derives all its force and eflicacy from the former. If the rules of
morality are to be held binding on mankind, they must, like the
Jaws ot human judicatories, infer, it not rewards for compliance
with them, certain punishments for the ditobedience of them.
How are theft; punishments difcoverablc, and by whom infli&ed,
it we are not to take into the account religious principles, which,
whether denved from natural or revealed religion, inftruft us that
â¢we are accountable to a Supreme Being, who will certainly vindi
cate laws, which, if they have any foundation in truth, must be de
rived from him ?âDisjoining religion from morality, has given
rife to many falfe systems, which, by being fucceflively shewn to
be erroneous, has had a tendency to inspire Icepticifm in refpeft
to there being any solid hafis for morality. Paley's fyflem of
ethics, by making religion the foundation" of morality, avoids this
great stumbling block, which is a ltrong recommendation ot that
woik to the public.
PITTSBURGH, September 24
Lieut. Jeffers, from Fort Franklin, has related
to us the following, in order to Ihew the disin
terested attachment of Cornplanter tothe United
States.
A propofa] having been made to Tome of the
â¢warriors of the Six Nations to join the hostile
Indians, in order to prevent our army from pe
netrating into their country, and several had ac
tually accepted the proposal, and were endea
voring to pei fuade others to join them. As soon
as the Cornplanter heard of this, he immediate
ly fetit a runner, with a speech, which he order
ed to be spoke three times to them ; the purport
of which was, that if they were determined for
war, to go off immediately, and never return,
for should he, or any of his warriors ever fee
them, they would put them to death. This had
the desired effectâthe Indians immediately dis
banded, and thus the affair subsided.
Capt Buell, of the 2d United States regiment,
arrived here on Saturday lalt with a fine com
pany of men, enlisted for three years.

Philadelphia, October 8.
By the Englifti Packet, arrived at New-York, accounts are re
ceived from Europe to the 12th August. The English papers
contain numerous reports relative to a Counter Revolution in
France, among others, that the Swiss Cantons have complained to
the National AfTembly of their troops being paid in af&gnats, in
stead of cash, as was formerly the cafeâThe Diet of the Cantons
havealfo forbid their troops to take the new oath decreed by the

have escaped their fury: he fought in Thurot's squadron at Car

What will be the lfTueof these dreadtul disturbances, God only
knows. The general conje&ure is, that the negroes mull very soon
disperse for want of provisions, as they are almost starving, whilst
the people in the towns have great abundance, and seemed to be
in good spirits on the 14th September.
Thursday arrived in this city, the Earl of Wycombe, a Mem

It is said in a Richmond paper, that Mr. Ro
bert Carter, of Nominy, Virginia, has emanci
pated 442 HavesâThis, if true, is a facrifice on
the Altar of Humanity of perhaps an Hundred

ry and praiseworthy in an age vvheri Mammon is
the god that commands the molt extenlive con
gregation of worihippers.
Among a variety of accounts from Cape Fran
cois, the following has been related :âA widow,
who owned a plantation on which there were a -
bout 500 negroes, having always treated them
with humanity and kindness, on-the alarm from
the insurgents, these flslves applied to their own
er for arms to defend her property âand when
the'plantation was attacked, they repelled and
beat off the adailants, by which means the estate
was preserved from deftru&ion.âHumanity as
well as honpity will be found to be the belt policy.
ce Nothing creates more discontent among tlie
people than the secrecy which rulers are apt to
affeift. The difaffed:ion arising from this, is as
(ure as from mal-adminiftration. It is hard to re
train people to order very long, without making
them lee their interest in it. From this observa
tion we will not except the fubjeds of the molt
despotic monarchies : for not even the iron rod
of (lavery can always reduce to tame fubmilfion,
people who can fee no advantage accruing from
allegiance. But in free States, there can be no
authority maintained, without making the sys
tem of policy apparently conducive to the gene
ral good. The people of the American States,
have long lain under a general odium for want
of patriotism ; which has arisen from their re
peated opposition to government, âand their
backwardness jto comply with the demands of
the public upon their property. The late peace
able and patriotic condu<ffc under the operation
of the new government, will, we hope, retrieve
them from this reproach, and serve to discover
the cause from whence their former
arose.
" The qnietnefs of our land under the equal ad
ministration of this government âleaves us well
allured that the former ditturbances, arose from
a defective system of policy.âOne of the moil
observable defecfis, was that intricacy with which
our revenue fyjlems were clogged. The people
were utterly unable to comprehend the compli
cated measures which were adopted in raising
supplies ; and from thence derived the idea,that
all their monies were anticipated, before they
came to the public treasury. And nothing could
awaken the spirit of resentment more than to
have theirproperty wafted in supporting the idle
ness, and making the fortunes of their insolent
colletflors. In the apprehension of all, the least
attention from government, would have removed
this evil. But when they saw the mystery (till
kept up, against the general wish, and the sys
tems of revenue covered in abstrusity, they were
provoked with an honed indignation against the
measures of their rulers. For a season they laid
a fide their industry and patriotism, which they
were convinced, could no longer be viitues.
"By the operation of the federal government,
this evil is removed ; and the spirit of industry
and patriotism has returned. This evinces both
the perspicuity of the present system of admnuf
trarion, and the riling glory of our country.
And fliould our rulers continue to discard all
mviteries in politics, and condu(ft their national
bu'finefs in a plain, easy, and intelligible man
ner, we have every rea(on to expecft that the\
! will feenre the public confidence, and find an ea
j 1 y access to the property oi the citizens.

On Tuefdav last the Pkifodelphian Raptijl AJJ'ociation convened in

New-Jerseyâaster which the Rev. Dofior Samu e l Jones was
chosen ModeratorâTheir session closed on Thursday.
Representation constitutes the essence of Republicanismâand
the rights of ele&ion are the highcft, moll sacred and impor
tant that freemen can poflibly exercise. At the return of those
periods, therefore, when they are called npon by the Constitution
to give their fuffrages for those whom they chu'e should be their
political fathers, the majesty of the people appears iu its full dig
nityâif then, as has been laid, every freeman pofleffes in his pro
per person a portion of this majesty, no confederations can absolve
him from Che obligations he is under to attend his duty as an elec
tor. âSo long as eleltions are tree, and made by a full vote of an
enlightened community, so long will their liberties, conjlitution and
laws* which are all inseparably conne&ed, be fate; âbut if the
people are falfe to themselves, and leave their elections to be made
by a small number, who may happen to have no other business to
attend to at the moment, they (port with their dearest privileges ;
and it depends on a mere contingency whether the conduit of their
affairs is committed to the able friends, or the fpecipus, tho un
principled, enemies of their country.
" A good man will certainly be happy, either in this life, or

The inequalities therefore which appear in the dispensations of

" The generality of men make themselves miserable by desir

imaginary evils vartly exceed the catalogue of those brought upon
us by real misfortunes.
-THE grcatefl part of the works which the public eftcem at pre
sent, have only arrived by degrees at that appro!>ation,
(e. ft. Shakefpear). A success too brilliant at the firft, affords but
a bad augur for its continuance, and only proves the mediocrity of
the work. Beauties which are within the reach of ail the world,
immediately make their impreflion; great beauties are often less
flriking, and it is rare that a work ot the firlt merit, obtains, at
the beginning, the fuffrage of a great number. It is only a few
who are able at: ofprr" n rTf*pH/Â»rÂ»f;p j_ bat.
by degrees the falfe glare which dazzled at the firft, begins to wear
off, and men gradually discover beauties that at firft escaped their
notice. Thisârlifcovery occasions an agreeable surprise. They
return to the fubjeft, and discover flill more ; so that their admira
tion continues to augment from day to day.

HOWARD,
THE PHI LAHTHROrE
AN ODE.
Written by Robert Merry, Esquire, under thefigrature of
Del la Crusca
THE roving Zephyr's gentle gale
That flutters in the flowery vale ;
That liovci s on the high hill's fide,
And curls the river's rtpling tide;
Shall oft, BENIGNANT HOWARD, shed
A winnow'd fragrance round thy head,
When chance at lultry noon thou'rt laid
Beneath the Afpin's quiv'ring shade.
At night no dissonance shall rife,
To chace light fiumber from thine eves ;
Near thy abode no found be heard,
Unless the melancholy biid,
Thar leans her bosom on the spray,
Shall warble all her woes away.
Yon pearly moon that beams so bright
Upon the fable breast of night,
Has seen thy wandering footfteps go
To (liores where distant billows flow,
Where Europe owns a Sultan's nod,
And {"marts beneath a Tyrant's rod.
Yon pearly moon now fees thee roarn
O'er Britain's Ifl'e, thy native home,
Explore each prison cell to cheer,
Sorrow and lonely want and tear :
For still compafTion bids thee wend
Towards him who has no other friend ;
Towards him who all forgotten lies.
Deep channels funk around his eves.
While from their balls' diftra&cd glare,
Looks forth the meagre fiend despair.
Alas for many a tedious year
His only folate was a tear ;
But now by time the source is dried,
And that hft ifolace is denied.
Methinks thro' forme small grate afa'*,
He nightly woos the POLAR STAR ;
That ever fettled as his woes,
Is all the fympithy he knows.
Yes, yes, in fancy, can I feel,
The keen delights that o'er thee steal;
The look of thanks, the wretch's prayer,
In Ihort forgctfulnefs of care ;
The fond wife's fmilc, the child's caress,
And all the luxury to bless.
O HOWARD, not the Poet's lays,
Tho HAYLEY celebrates thy praise ;
Nor yet the SENATE'S loud applause
To hail thee firft in Virtue's caufc;
Nor e'en the public's just design
To give the STATUE and the COIN ;
Can one cncreafing bliss impart
To that which centers in thy heart.
On earth thy recompence is giv'n,
Already iscommenc'a thy hcav'n.

COURT or KING'S BENCH.
Westminster-Hall, July 16.
Oldham vsrfus Emerson.
The plaintiff, an eminent ironmonger in Pol
born, had in April last purchaleda horh?from the
defendant for 601. for which sum he got a receipt
with a security that the horse was quiet, steady
free from vicc, &c. &c. But, when the plaintiff
began to ride him, he would flop, plunge, start
and go back (all which the plaintiffs servant and
several oihers swore to) upon which the horse
â was lent back to the defendant, who said he
would write about him to a Mr. Rainbridge, his
owner, who lived in the country, and would'pro
vide the plaintiff with another horse ; but after-'
wards refufed to give him either another horse,
or his money : to recover which, this atfion was
brought.
Mr- Erftine, for the defendant, insisted, thaf
he never intended to rescind the contract' and
that the plaintiff should have brought a special
adtion on the cafej instead of one far money had
and received ; he knew the horse was high-bred,
and blooded before he bought him ; and if he
afterwards met the fate of "Johnny Gilpin, from
his ignorance in h jrfemariihip, it was not the
defendant's fault. Belides, the defendant only
a<fted as deptuty for another. Mr. Erlkine then
called thirteen witnefles, some of them gentle
men of property, who all knew the horse; and
declared that he was gentle, well broke, well
worth the money given for him, and that little
boys used to ride him ; and that any man who
could not ride him, was not fit to ride at all.
â  Lord Kenyon said, that although the witnefles
on both fides differed very much, there wa3 no
ju(V reason to discredit either ; a horse might
one time be quiet, and another time thereverfe.
The plaintiff's servant was thrown, and himfelt
in danger of his life, as appeared on evidence ;
and therefore the horse could not be said to an
swer tlie purposes for which the plaintiffgot him.
As to the defendant's acting as a deputy, the
plaintiff, at the time of the contradi, provided a
gainst that.
The jury, after deliberating for some time,
gave their opinion, that the plaintiff fliould get
back his money, and that each party Ihould pay
his own corts : which was agreed to.
