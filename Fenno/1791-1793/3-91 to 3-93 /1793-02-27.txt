the Expedition under Major General St.
Clair, together with the Documents relat

Secretary at IVar, and the Memorial ej
Samuel Hodgdott, have proceeded in re

and examine other teflimony, produced to
themâto hear and cnnfider the written
communications, made by the Secretary at
IVur, Samuel Hodgdon, and the Cum
tnander in Chief of the Expedition } and,
as the refill of their farther enquiries,
mole the following
Supplementary Report:
T
X H E original Report commences
in the following wordsâ
" The contract for the supplies of the
army on the route from Fort Pitt, was
made by Theodoiius Fowler, with the
Secretary of the Treasury, and bears date
the twenty-eighth day of Qftober, one
thousand seven hundred and ninety ; that
at the fame time a bond in the penalty
of one hundred thousand dollars, with
Walter Livingfton and John Cochran,
securities thereto, was entered into, for
the due execution of the contract : That
on the third day of January, one thousand
seven hundred and ninety-one, the con
trad was wholly transferred from the
said Fowler, to William Duer, a copy of
which transfer was lodged in the office of
the Secretary of the Treasury ; that by
letter from the Secretary at War, bearing
diie the t'-vcrvty-fiftii. us February, oaa
thousand seven hundred and ninety-one,
aSdrcffed to William Duer, it appears
that he was considered as contractor ;
tkat no correspondence appears to have
taken place fubfeqtiently to that time be
tween Theodoiius Fowler and either the
Treasury or War Departments."
From documents received by the com
mittee, since their lad appointment, it
appears, that the copy of the beforc-men
tibned transfer was not lodged in the of
fice of the Secretary of the Treasury, un
til the seventh of April, one thousand se
ven hundred and ninety-one ; at which
time it was received by the Secretary of
the Treasury, under cover of a letter from
William Duer, informing him of the cir
cumftanoe of the said transfer, and mak
ing requifrtions for certain advances of
money. That the Secretary of the Trea
sury, by letter in reply, of the fame date,
agrees to make the advances required, to
WilliamTDiier, as the agent of 7'heodo/ius
It appears, that all the warrants, issued
r rom the Treasury, for the purposes of
vhis contrast, were issued to William Du
er, as the agent of Theodoiius Fowler.
I'he Secretary of the Treasury has fur
nifhsd the committee with the written
opinions of the Attorney General of the
U-nited States, and several other lawyers
of eminence, all of whom concur in opi
nion, that the securities to the bond, ori
ginally given by Theodoiius Fowler, for
the execution of this contract, are now
lefponfible for all damages, consequent
Â«ipon any breach of that contract.
The Secretary of War, who alone ap
pears to have been the agent, on the part
of the UnitcdStates, in all things relating
to the execution of the com raft, has al
ways coricfponded with William Duer,
as the contra&or, and his conefpoadence
commences at a date prior to that of the
copy of the contract lodged at the Trea
ury.
i he original Report pioceeda :
" That on the sixth of March, one
thousand seven hundred and ninety-one, a
f'Â»ntraÂ£t was entered into by Wiiliam
~" er Â» w 'th the Secretary at War, for
'Upplying the troops with provisions, un
til their arrival at Fort Pitt, and at Fort
ntt. A bond waÂ» at the fame time en
terevi iiUfl.by llye said William for i
the due execution of the said contract, in
the penalty of four thousand dollars,
without any security whatsoever."
It appeals, by are-examination of the
documents formerly before the committee
that the date and terms of the last men
tioned contrast, were misrepresented ; thtf
date being the twenty-sixth, instead of
the fuih of April, and the terms of the
contract, being to furnilh provisions for
the.troops until their arrival at Fort Pitt,
bat not during their continuance at that:
place. The fidl of these miflakts appear
to have been merely casual, the second
appears to have avifen from paying great
er attention to the manner in which the
contradt was realiy executed, than to the
terms of the contract itfelf, it Jaa^ n g been
conceived by the committee, that Colonel
Neville, che agent for supplying the
tt'oqps during their continuance at Foit
' Pitt, afi under the Jafi Mentioned con-.
trail. This circumftaricc is rendered'the
leis material, from the consideration, that
according to the plan of the campaign,
no delay of the troops at Fort Pitt was
counted upon. The ilatement is other
wise correct.
The Secretary at War, in his commit
nicarion, states, that it was not the cus
tom of the office, to require other lecuri
ty than that of the contractor, for the
dueeKccutionof contracts of small amount;
and it appears by a letter of the Secreta
ry of the Treasury written since the for
mer report, that the Secretary at War
consulted with him upon the occasion
alluded to, and that he agreed in opini
on, that farther fecuiity was not necef
fai y.
It is stated in the original report, after
speaking of one of the contraftor'g agents,
that
" It appears by letters from John
Kean, another of the contra&ors agents,
that no monies had been received by him
on the eighth of May, and it appears
that on the twenty-third of March there
was advanced to William Duer on the
last mentioned contract, ti<e sum of fif
teen thousand dollars."
Upon re-examining the letters of John
Kean, it appears that he nad received the
sum of foDr hundred and fifty dollars, and
no more, before the aforefaid eighth day
of May, which was before overlooked by
the committee. And it appears from
documents received by the committee
since their report, that the sum of fifteen
thousand dollars was not advanced to
William Duer on account of the last men
tioned contract, on the twenty-third of
March. The committee were led into
this mistake, by a document leceived from
the Tteafurer, repiefenting the fad as
Hated in the original report, which docu
ment is (till befoie the committee.âThe
true llate of this tranfaftion as recently
dated, appears to be as follows :
A wartaut issued in favor of Joseph
Howell, on the twenty-third of March,
for the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, for
the use of the war department generally,
and not for William Duer, as Hated in
the aceount rendered by the Treasurer:
Of which sum, were advanced to William
Duer, on the twenty-sixth of March, four
thousand dollars; on the eighth day of
May following, were paid to James Smith,
comra&ing agent for William Duer, one
thousand dollars ; and between the twen
ty-firlt 6f May and the twenty-third of
July, were paid to John Kean, another
agent for William Duer, four hundred
and thirtyÂ«feven dollars and ninety-one
cents ; making the whole sum advanced
on the last mentioned contrafl, fivt thou
sand fourliiNidred and thirty seven dollars,
and ninety-one cents. âThe residue of the
fifteen thousand dollars is suggested to
have been applied to the use of the war
department generally-
The original report dates, thatâ
" It appears from the correspondence
of General Butler, from the ninth of May
to the ninth of June, repeated complaints
309
were raarl? v.* fatal inifmanagcir.ents and
ncgleÂ£ts, in the quartet Waiter's zmi milf
tary stores departments, particular ly as
to tents, kriapfacks, camp kettles, car
tridge boxes, pack-saddles, &c. all, of
which articles were deficient in quantity
and bad in quality. The pack-iaddlfs
particularly were made in Philadelphia,
which with the tranfportution, amounted
to more than,double the price at which
they might lisve been procured at Fart
Pitt, and wete found upon examination
to be unfit fop use."
Mr. Hodjdon has produced to the
committee, a number of ex-parte affida
vits and certificates, to prove, that these
several were furnifhed, in 1 effici
ent quantities, and of good quality.â
Molt of these affidavits however, were
made by the manufacturers of the respec
tive articles, or persons in the employ
ment of Mr. Hodgdon, and generally
written in adiffeient hand-writing, from
that of the- lubfcribirtg' cltponeiun ; ami*
molt of the certificates, by p:ilons un
known to the committee- But the testi
mony formerly taken by the committee,
and the corroboration of it by the evi
dence of refpeftable and difintereited per
sons, lately taken by the committee, in
presence of Mr. Hodgdon, appears abun
dantly fufficient to juilify the statement
of fadts, contained in the original report.
With refpeft to the pack-saddles howe
ver, it is necelTary to remark, that foine
qualification of the expression used in the
original report, would be proper. They
appear to have been made of different
sizes : those of the largell size arc proved
to have been wholly unfit for use, the
horses used for pack-horses being general
ly small. Some of the smaller pack-sad
dles, however, appear to have been used
in the iampaigr., and to have answered
the intended purpose better than was at
fir ft expedted.
It is stated in the 01 iginal report thatâ
" The arms sent forward appear not
to have been duly examined, and arrived
at Foit Pitt extremely out of order, and
mauy totally unfit for use, which circum
stance rendered repairs ablolutely necessa
ry, and added to the delay of the troops,
at Fort Pitt."
The committee arc led to conclude,
from authentic information recently re
ceived, that the complaint of the arms in
tended for the regular troops and levies,
is unfounded ; some of the arms appear to
have been damaged, after they were put
into the hands of the troops, from their
inexperience or carelessness, tho' deliver
ed to them in good order.
The committee were induced to make
the unqualified statement contained iri the
original report, from the unqualified man
ner in which this fubjeÂ£t is spoken of by
some of the witnesses, formerly examined
by the committee ; they not having ftaied
with Sufficient prtcilion, the caufea of the
arms being out of repair, nor fpecifying
the probable number requiring repairs.
'1 he original report proceeds with the
following txpreffion :
" It appears, that a great proportion
of the powder, supplied for the use of the
aimy, was not of good quality, tho' an
experiment made by major Fergufon, at
Fort Pitt, with a howitzer, who report
ed in favor of the quality of the powder."
The committer are fatislied, from ex
periments made since the original report
by captain Ford, at Fort Washington,
upon reque ft of the Secretary at War,
and by samples of the powder from thence,
actually furniflied the committe, that the
powder was oiiginally of good quality ;
but that a certain quantity of it was da
maged by exposure to the air and moisture
afur being issued to the troops- And it
appears to have been powder of this de
feription, upon which experiments were
made by some of the officers in the expe
dition, which produced unfavorable im
pieflions as to the quality of the powder
in general ; for it i* certain, a belief was
currently entertained among ft the officers,
[Whole No. 400.J
, tfaa? tta pow<let jn genera* of
'good quality. 'iie- ii/uifitient yN/i nt> e
powder,suffer the army took the field,
is accounted for from the bad qu&litj off
the tents. It is in U llimony to tlie (#m
mittee, that tfteat quantities of tlÂ»e fated
ammunition were a&ually 1 endwed uteleft
from that cause.
It is ftatecl in tlis original report,
that-*-
" Mr. Hodgdon was appointed qiiar
er malter-general in the month of-Mawh,
ind continued at Philadelphia until the
4th of June, he'then proceeded to jFort
Pitt, where he ariived on the
the fame monthâno fnfiicicnt caufovliive
appeared to rh*i' committee to juflify thi(
delay, and his preftnee with
' peared to have been, efP ntially
pre.vioufly to that time." >
In this ftatemei.t, the duration of Mr.
flodgdon's stay at Foit Pitt v as casual
ly omitteii, which appears to have been
from tiw tctith of June, till the V*Â«n,Y
fixth of AiÂ»grtift. -The insertion of this
fa& will fufficiently explain the sense of
the committee, in the inference tefpeft
ing the time, in which the presence of
the quarter-roaster-general was neccfTdvjr
at the army.
It is dated in the original report,
thatâ
" There were fix hundred and leventy
five (land of a-ms, at Fort Washington,
on the firfl: of June, and moll of tfiofi
totally out of repair."
These arms* the precise number of
which appears not to be accurately afecr
tained, are admitted by the Secretary at
War, to have been at Fort Washington,
in the situation described, but he fnggefts,
that they were old and ufelefsarms, which
had been oolkfled at that place, and
were not counted upon, as any part of
the supply of arms for the expedition.â
It appears, that the regular troops and
levies were completely supplied with ?rms,
without recurrence to this (lock: but a
number of them was repaired, by orders
of the commander in chief, of the ex
pedition, with a view, as he suggests, to
arm the militia from Kentucky, who, it
was expected, would arrive, either in
efficiently armed, or not armed at all :
and he did not conceive the arrangements,
made by the war department, competent
to arming the militia, together with the
other troops.
The original repoit dates, that
" The privates of the levies received
but three dollars pay each, fiom the time
of thei'i refpeftive inliflments to the time
of their refpedive difiharges, and were
adtially discharged without farther pay
or Settlement ; notes ftf discharge were
piven them, Specifying the time of their
Service, and bearing - indorsations, that
some advances had been made to them on
account, without dating the amcunt,
the objed of which is fuggelted to have
been to prevent transfers ; the intended
effi.d was not produced by the meafurt ;
the notes were fold for trifling considera
tions, the real sums due on the note*
were various, from ten to twenty-five
dollars, and they weie frequently fold for
one dollar, or one gallon of whiflcy ;
the monies foi the pay of the levies did
not leave Philadelphia, till the fourth of
December, one thousand seven hundred
and ninety-one, nor arrive at Eort-
Waihington, till the third of January,
one thousand seven hundred and ninety
two, some time after the last inlilled levies
are known to have been entitled to their
difchaiges."
In addition to the reasons contained in
the original report, refpeÂ£ting the diCr
charging of the levies, without their (li
pulattd pay, which arc admitted by the
Secretary at War, to have heen justly
dated, he has, Sahls late lommunicatioD,,
suggested to the committee, that, at the
time of the discharge of the levieÂ«, there
was a&ually, in the hands of the<juarter
nufter-gcueral, t!ie sum v.f fixtcee

PARIS, December 33.
NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Wednesday, December 26.
TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI.
It having been decided on Tuesday, in
tortfequence of a request from the Command
ant General of Paris, that the unfortunate
Louis should be brought to the bar the next
morning, at 9 o'clock, the fitting of Wednef
dav commenced at that hour.
Within a few minutes afterwards, the Pre
sident said, " I announce to the All'embly
that Louis and his defenders are ready to ap
pear at the bar. I forbid the members or the
ipeftaturs to (hew any signs of censure or ap
probation. Louis then appeared at the bar,
accompanied Ijy M. M. Lamorignon Mallher
bes, Tronchet, de Seze, the Mayor of Paris,
and the Commandant of the National Guards.
The Pie fide nt said, Louis the Convention
has decreed, that you ihould be definitively
heard to-day.
" My Coanfel will read to you my
Louis,
defence."
M. do Seze then read for some hours the
defence, of which the substance is here given,
as exactly as we can collect it, though the
whole could by no means be contained within
the limits of a newspaper. It began thus:
" Citizen Reprelentatives of the Nation,
the moment is then arrived, in which Louis,
accused in the name of the French people, and
surrounded by the Counlel which humanity
and the law have given him, is about to deli
ver his juftificattnfi.' Even the silence with
â which we are surrounded, informs me, that
the day of jaltice has succeeded to the day of
presumption and pre-judgment. The mif
fortunes of Kings have something much more
affecting and more sacred than those of other
men ; and he who once occupied the nioft
brilliant Throne in the univÂ«rle, ought to ex
cite the molt powerful You have
called him into the midst of you, and he is
Come, withÂ«alnniefs, with dignity, itrong in
his innonccnce, fuppoiteciby the teftinionv of
a whple life. He has difiovered to you such
to be his thoughts, by diicuffmg, without pre
paration, without examination,charges which
be could n'(t forefee, and offering an extem
porary defence. Louis could only tell you of
his innocence ; I come to piove it. Would
that this circle could increase tffl the whole
multitude of citizen',, who have received a
dreadful imprelfion againll him, could be con
tained in it, that they might form a different
opinion. Louis knows that Europe experts,
with impatience, the judgment which you
shall give; he knows, that posterity will, one
day, inveltigate it j but he considers only his
Contemporaries. Like liinj Â«ve torget poste
rity, and fee only the present moment."
M. de Seze then said, that the question
be confiderid in two points of view,
aitker with refpert to Louis bcfcie or after
his acceptance of the Constitution. The Na
tion, he admitted, was tlie Sovereign, and
was tree to give itfelf what fonn of govern
ment it pleal'ed ; but the Nation itfelf could
not exercile its own Sovereignty, and mult,
therefore, delegate it. In 1789 the Nation
thole a monarcbia! government, and decreed
the inviolability of its chief. He then (hew
ed that the forfeiture of the throne was the
only puniihment to which the King, accord
ing to the Constitution, could be fubjeft; and
that it was only for the crimes committed af
ter this destitution, that he could be tried,
like other citizens. . Either the crimes of
which Louis was accused, were held crimeÂ»
by the Constitutional Ast, and of course, if
proved, were to be puniihed according to that
Ast, or they were not to- be found in it; and
were, therefore, not to De Buuiflted at all-
H* would, however, adin>t,fur argument's
fake, that the crimes were all proved, and all
mentioned in the Act. What
then was the punilhrilent! The abdication of
the Throne. Bui it might be (aid. that the
nation had already abolifhcd tlie Throne, so
that there was 110 further puniihment ot Lou
is; were new laws to be made, applicable on
ly to one aan, and formed fincethe accusation
itfelf!
If, however, Louis was to be deprived of
bis inviolability as a King, he inuft then, of
course, have the right of being judged like a
Citizen, and in that cafe, where were the pre
fervatory forms of trial decreed for citizens
by the law? Where were tfie Jurors, tfiofe
hoflages for the lives and honor of Citizens ?
Where was the proportion of fuffrages which
the law had so wifely established ? Where that
silent ballot which inciolcd within the fame
urn, the opinion and conscience of thfe Judge ?
4t I speak to you/' said M. ,de* Seze, 44 with
the freedom of a free man ; I search among
you for Judges, and I fee only Accusers; you
would give judgment upon Louis, and you
have accused him ; you would try him, and
you have already expressed your will.
" As to tbe charge of hav ing wished to dis
solve the National .AfTembly* Was it forgot
ten that Louis had convoked it P Was it for
gotten that during 150 years Princes, more
jealous of their authority, had constantly re
fufed that convocation ? Was it forgotten,that
but for Louisâbut for the numerous facri
fices tosvhich he had consented, the audienee
could not then be fitting to deliberate upon
the interests of the State ?"
He would not then speak of the Memoir in
whichTallien was said to have the care of pro
ducing a Counter Revolution intruded in
part to him ; but even upon an ordinary tri
al, could it be permitted, that papers taken
from a citizen, without an inventory and uu
fealed, by the invasion of his house, should bfc
produced in the evideuce againil him ? In
some of these papers mention was made of
money which had been expended ; but even if
it was denied that this expence was for pur
poses of benevolence, could it be forgotten
how easily Kings were circumvented and de
ceived ? The plan of a letter to La Fayette
and Mirabeau was spoken of, but this letter
had not been sent; and as to the letter of
thanks to Bouille, the Constituent AfTembly
itfelf had voted thanks to that officer. But
the words werefVill to be uttered which would
immediately overthrow the whole series of
accusationsâthey were these : . 4i s[ub
to all these circumstances, Louis accepted
the Constitution. The Constitution was the
padfc of alliance between the People and the
Kingâthere was no longer any contentionâ
the past was forgotten. What had been done
subsequent to this acceptance was now to be
examined.
" The Constitution had not ordered the
guarantee of the King for the Ministers ; but,
on the contrary had commanded the refpon
iibility of the Ministers for the King ; and
even if the Constitution was forgotten, the
King and his Ministers could not be both ac
cused for the fame a<fts. Louis had been ac
cused of delay ing the execution of the decree
relative to Avignonâthe Minister Oeleffart
had been accuTed of the fame thjng. Louis
had been accuted of not communicating in
telligence of the Treaty of Pilnitz ; but was
not that the province of.the if
it hadheen a public in {tea d of a secret tranf
aftion ? He had been reproaehed with the
troubles of Nimes, Jales, and other places ;
but was the King to be answerable for all the
troubles of a great Revolution ? The account
given by Narboune was laid to the charge of
Louis ; but had not the National Afl'cmbly
itftlf declared, that Narbonne carried with
him the regrets and the confidence of the Na
tion ? ahe surrender of Longwy and Verdun
weie imputed to him ; but were not the in
habitants of these places the guilty persons ?
And who had appointed the Cpmmander of
Verdun, who chose rather to die than to
yield ?âWas it not Louis
M. dc Seze pursued his speech with much
perspicuity, contending and (hewing, that ei
ther Louis had no of the circum
ttances with Which he was charged, or that
they were not crimtiya! ; or that he could not
be held responsible for them ; or that, if ie
jfponfible, the punifliment could.not justly, or
even lawfully be greater thau the deposition.
With refpeft to ftie affair of the 10th of
August, he argued, that the King had made
no preparation for the defence of his own Pa
lace ; that the condi tut ion al magistrates {vera
with him, and that one of those read the arti
cle of the law wMch authorized the oppofitiQn
of force to force ; that when he was invited
to the AffemblV, he went there, and that, the
battle did not commence till an hour after
ward*. It trad been fa id by many deputies in
the Convention, that thfcy had aflifted in pro
ducing the events of that clay : If then, they
had been premeditated, how couid Louis be
accused of them ? Louis, who had never given
a sanguinary order; who, at Wetmes, chofc
ratliqr to return a captive than to expjfc the
-310-
life of one man ; who, on the 2oth of June, re
futed evpry fort of defence, and chose rather
toreinairi alone in the midst of his people â¢ â
Louis, of whom history would be heard to fay,
that during a reign of twenty years he had
borne only an example of moderation,jultice He
economy ! who h-)d abolished servitude in his
domains ; who, when the people wiihed for
liberty, gave it to them ?
Tliere was liere some murmur ; but the
Counsel went through several other articles
of the accusatory ast, which it is less materi
al to notice here, and admonilhed the Conven
tion that history would judge their judgment.
At the conclufmn of the speech Louis role
and said, " Citizens, the means of my de
fence have beenjult exiled to you j I (hall
not relume them. In speaking to you, per
haps, for the last time, I declare that ijiy con*
science reproaches me with nothing. My de
fenders have laid only the tiuth.
" My heart is torn when I perceive mylelf
fufpefted of having wiihed to (hed the blood
of the people, and especially of being the au
thor of what palled on the loth of Augull.
I avow, that the multiplied proofs of my love
for the people seem to me fufficient to remove
me from this charge,and prove,that I have not
feared to expose myfelf that blood might be
lived."
The President presenting a note to Louis,
asked him if he knew the writing ?
LouisâNo.
PrelidertâDo you recollect these live keys?
Lonisâl Cannot immediately recollect
them : I know I returned some to Thierry
when I was at the Convent of the Feuillans,
but cannot positively fay that these are the
fame.
PresidentâHave you nothing else to fay in
your defence?

the idea, that if the state of Vermont is not con

operate to the injury of the other states.

The consideration of the amendments propos
ed by the Senate to the appropriation bill was
refujned by the House.âThe amendment to the
feition authorising a loan,in anticipation of the
funds, was further debated. This amendment
goes to vest a discretionary power in the Pru
dent of the United States to pay off tlie debtdus '
to the Bank of the tlnited States, in instalments
not exceeding 50,000 dollars, having refpe& t6
the public exigencies, and the state of the trea
liiry. The discretionary power hereby propos
ed to be inverted, was opposed, as not being pro
perly limited ; âas the provision for paying
off the debt in queflion was irrelative to the pro
per idea of an appropriation bill. And as the Le
gislature ought not to delegate this discretions
It was further opposed, as making an arrange
ment to pay a debt to a public body before it
was due, in preference to individuals
whose demands arc already due.
In opposition to this reasoning, it was said
that theamendment contemplates a provision in
a cafe which has been the fubjeit of complaint
to those who now oppose itâand that is, it vests
a power in the President of the United States to
employ, from time to time, the revenues in the
treasury which may not be especially appropria
ted for other purposes, to pay off its debtsâso
that the revenues may not at any time lie useless.
Thatthe public monies fhouldlye dormant &use
less in the treafHry( which it was denied has ever,
been the ca'e) has been a fubjedl of declamation
.âand now that an unexceptionable expedient is ,
proposed to guard against such a contingency, Â»
a surplus of revenue would present, the opposi
tion is continued from the fame quarter. After
a long debate, the question on concurring with
the Senate was determined by ayes and noes, as

THOUGHTS ON THE
STATE OF AMERICAN INDIANS.
(CONTI N U ED.)
T) UT no exertions have been made in thrs
country tor the civilization of the Indians,
in any mealure proportioned to ihe importance
and difficult ot the objed. The history of the
ettleinent of this country is silent upon this
. We have no account of any general and
uniform plan of civilizationâof any rational
and extensive system of education for their you'.h
---or anv well formed attempts to bring them to
tfce knowledge and pradiceof agriculture.âThe
tceble and solitary exertions which have be n
. T have >e P gf.
rcted chiefly by pious nrHHenai-ies, whoiiave
een employed and (upported by the charities
and contributions of religjous societies abroad,
and whose single purpose was to gÂ»ve thrm a
no w ledge of the do&rines and precepts of the
Chriltiaji religionâ an idea which nothing but
an uncommon fhareof piety could indulge wilh
any hope of fuccefs,or pursue with any degree
ot ardor. The minds of favagrs are too
and uninformed for the reception of truths so
spiritual and sublime. Confined to a few ob
jefls, and Void of those artificial wants which
society and luxury create, the circle oftheir ideas
must necefTarily be contracted. Not being ac
cuftonaed to much reflection or abftradimi of
sentiment, they are in a measure incapablc of
speculative knowledgeâthey have not comprc
hrnfion of mind fufficient for any rhing t+iat lies
beyond the ordinary compass of their thoughts.
Attempts to inftru& them in truths of this
kind, before their minds are enlarged and
ftrcrtgthened by education and mftruftion,
without a combination of favorable circum
stances, could rarely, if ever, succeed. There
*re a few inlianccs, however, in which they have
been persuaded to embrace Christianity ; but
ifrs is principally to be afcnbrd so the incxtin
gwfhable zeal and indefatigable exertions of ihe
ifiifltonarifs. sÂ»'>me feeble atumpts have bcrn
made to inftruft their youthâto bring them to
a frttied relidcnce, and to the enjoyment of fa
cial comforts. These were however the acci
dental avid temporary projects of individuals,
rather than any uniform and determined plan
of government; and as they originated with the
miflionaries, and were conducted by them, so
also they ended with them.
The rarity of such as were furnifhed with ta
lents lor so laborious and important a taskâthe
difficulty of mainlining a conilant succession of
aÂ£tive and zealous men to pursue these mea
futes âand the interruptions which necessarily
took place in consequence of these difficulties,
defeated aoy favorable beginuing which had
been madeâand the plans which had been
formed with any degree of forefight or proba
bilitj of success, miscarried, by not being Rea
dily and vigorously puifued.
The inadequacy of the schemes, therefore,
which have been devised for the purpose of ci
vilizing the Indians, to the magnitude of the
object, with the languid and unfteadv manner
in which they .have been pursued, juftify us in
afliguing this as one reason why greater progress
has not been made in that bufmrls.
[To be continued.]
Philadelphia, Feb. 27.
Abjliatt oj further European intelligence by the
January Packet.
Two motions made in the British House of
Lords by Lord Lanfdowneâone refpefting an
interceding application to the National Con

the other refpefting the French emigrants in
England, proposing that with the consent and

grants should be 'ent to the western parts of
Canada, were debated on the 21 ft December ;
the firft was withdrawnâthe last negatived
by a great majot ity.
The French persist in their determination
of opening the Scheldtâthe Dutch continue
opposed to the measure, and are putting their
marine on a war establishment. A small
squadron of British Ihips, under Commodore
Murray, has failed from the Downs, for the
Scheldt. It was reported that the French
army had attacked Maeftricht, one of the ci

the patriotic citizens of Philadelphia.âThe

and three Light Infantry companies, paraded
at an early hour at the State-houfeâfrom
whence they marched to the Artillery Ground.
Capt. Fiflier's company fired a federal salute

Aibrt, EoflpatHoufai.d two hundred ninety-two, dollars
and seventy cÂ«MÂ«, which were fubjeft to
be applied to any objed, agreeably to
the discretion of the commander in chief
of the expedition, and might have been
applied ; if he thought proper, to the
payment of the difeharged levies, and
would have been fuf&cieiit for two months
pay to the ofLcers, aud four months pay
to the privates. This sum is admitted by
the to have been
in his hands, at the time of the discharge
of tl*e levies, and would have been ap
plied to their pay, if orders had been
given by the commandei in chief of the
expedition, for that purpose. Bui that
no fiich 01 deis ever were received by him.
The Secretary at War inieisÂ» from theie
circumllanccs, that no censure lliould be
imputed to the war department, tor not
having paid implicit attention'to this sub-
j ei^-
The circumstances tefpectiiigthis tranl
a&ion have been attentively examined oy
the committee, and appear to them to be
the following : The quaiter-maller gene
ral, upon his leaving Philadelphia, was
fiiinifhtd with the of twenty thou
laod dollars, for the use of that depart
ment. He was afterwards furnilhcd with
two other sums, to wit : the sum of seven
teen thousand eight bundled and forty
four dollars and tifty cents, on the twenty
third day of July, and the sum of two
thousand, two hundred and twenty-four
dollars and sixty cents, on the seventh
day of July, making together, the ium
of twenty thousand and sixty-nine dollars
and ten cents. It appears by letter from
the Secretary at War, to the commander
in chief of the expedition, that live thou
iand dollars of this sum were to be applied
to the pay of the tegular troops, it the
commander in chief Ihould deem that a
proper application of the money, which,
however was not done. The remaining
part of this money was intended tu term
a kind of military chest, to anfwet con
tingent cxpences ; subject however to the
controul of the commander in chief. It
appears that the quatter-mafter general,
in addition toihufe supplies ofcafh, was
authorized to draw bills on the Secretary
at War, with this reftrittion that the
commander in chief (hi uld approve of all
draughts, and certify the neceffi'.y or pro
priety of making them. The quarter
mailer general commenced his draughts
at Fort Pitt, previouily to his arrival at
head quarters, to the amount of two thou
sand liy. hundred dollars, and continued
them after his artival ; but it does not
appear that thofc draughts were certified,
01 Unftiontd by the commander in chief:
all which draughts were honored by the
Secretary at War.
It is suggested by the commander in
chief, that he pever coi.hdered the money,
hefore-mentroned,appropriated to the pay
of the levies, upon their difbhargts, nor,
that it was ever intended to be applied to
that objedl- He further fuggelts a want
of knowledge of the money, laid to be on
hand, at the time of the dilcharges of the
levies, although he admits, that the quar
ter-maller-general, (hortly after his arrival
at head quarters, tendered him a statement
of the calh on hand, whith he returned,
without examination, observing, that he
had already received fufficient informati
on relatively thereto, from the Secretary
at War ; that he was informed of the a-
monies originally received by
the quarter-master-general, and conceived
that he could form some idea of the ba
lance on hand, from the sums disbursed in
confequencw of warrants drawn by him,
which, he expected, were paid from that
fundâthat has want of information, as
to the real balance, arose from the cir
cumstance of the bills drawn by the quar
termailer general, without his knowledge,
or the requisite certificate Irorn him,
which bills operated, as a relief to that
fund, for their amount.âThe commander
in chief of the expedition further suggest
ed, to the committee, in presence of the
quarter - mailer - general, that, upon
making draughts upon the fund before
alluded to, he usually enquired of the
quarter-master-general, whether it was
fufficient for the jiurpofe of answering
the draught, and upon repeating this en
quiry, just before the discharge of the
levies, he received for answer, â¢' that
the chest was very low." This statement
was acquiesced in, orat.leaft, not denied
by the quaiCsrrinafter-gentrah
The quaster-msfttr-generalhas furniflr
cd the committee with a statement of his
account, by which it appears, that he
Lad on hand, or. the fifth day of Novem
ber, one thousand fcven hundred *nd nine
ty one, ca(h, to the amount of fifteen
thousand nine hundred and twelve dollars,
and forty-two cents, and two thirds of a
cent, which, he fuggells, have been since
applied to the use of his department.â
This balance is denied to have been on
hand, by the commander in chief, at that
time : and he has furnilhed a llatement of
dilburfements from the original fund }
which leaves the amount of the balance,
at the time of the discharge of the levies
of one thousand four hundred eighty tiiree
dollars eighty-fix cepts, exclusive of five
thousand dollais. appropriated to the
j of the old troopn.
The commander in chief further sug
gests, that there was no paymaster to the
army, liorany person authorised to lettk
the accounts of the soldiers and afcertaiu
the real balances due to them> until the
arriyal of Mr. Swann, on the thiid day
of January, on thousand seven hundred
I and ninety two ; >and insets, that he had
no authority to direÂ£t a fettlcment and or
der pay to the foliiiers, until he was in
fo. med of the arrangements made at the j
war'office, relatively to that object. This
fuggellion is llrongly confirmed by a let
ter from the fecittary at war, addrefled
to the commander in chief, and forward
ed by Mr. Swann, which designates Mr.
Swann as paymaltei, and contains instruc
tions relatively to the terms of fettling the
accounts of the soldiery. The fame let
ter feiv'ei td (hew, that the twenty thou
sand and fixity nine dollars, and.ten cents,
put into the pofeffion of the quai ter maiter
general, were not conclusively dettined
for the pay of the levies, nor so consider
ed by the secretary at war. Ikcaufe it
is affertcd in the lettef, that Mr. Swann
is furnilhed with a sum of money fumcient
for the whole pay of the levies, without
makiii"" any deduction in confequenee of
the monies futmfhed the quarter mailer
general.
It is alferted by the Secretary at War,
in his communication to the committee,
that the time of the feivice of the levies
did not expire until after the arrival of Mr.
Swann at Fort Walhington, particularly
Gaither's and Rhea's battalions, the term
in their inlillments having been, to serve
fix months aftertheir arrival at Fort Walh
ington ; which was deemed at the place
of rendezvous. The time which had e
lapsed from tile period of inlillmeuts to
their arrival at Foit Walhington, or the
evident impropriety of annexing such a
condition to the enlistments, caused the
condition itfelf to be dispensed with, and
those levieswere adually difenarged (hort
iy after the twelfth of November, one
thousand seven hundred and ninety-one,
in consequence of having served fix
months, which is the extent of the service
authorized by law, and actually received
certificates at that time, of having per
formed fix months service.
Upon a re-examination of the residue
of the original report, and the evidence
now before the committee, they are fa
tisfied with the fame, and find no mate
rial alterations 0.1 correttions necefiary.
A regard for candor has induced the
â¢ â¢ r
committe to adopt this mode of leport
' ing ; because the original' repoit is there
by preserved, mistakes exilting in the
fame, and which are now corrected, and
the causes of those mistakes rendered ob
vious, and the whole fubjeft presented to
view, upon the fairelt terms, in ttie opin
ion of the committe, to all persons in a
ny degree coucerened therein.
