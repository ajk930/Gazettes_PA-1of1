A SECOND ESSAY
ON THE
ISLAND navigation
between TH! rivers of
SUSWEHAWVAH ANn SCHL'YLKILK.
THE Remarks (m Dun'.ao's piper <i! Joiv â ;j
on my plan of cÂ»nftru6ting the Inlir.d Navi
gation between tlv Sufquehannah atld Sclluyli.ll!,
has done what every man ought to do, v. i>o has
thai most intercftme concern at heartâl. e. be has
published the objeaions i.-> my plan which occur
red to him ; for 'tis certainly bett-r to forefee ob
jedtions, than to meet them unexpefteJly in the
courle of the work. .
For the fame reason 'tis iny duly to obviate those
ofcirftions it I fairly can, that we may not he dif-l
couragid by an appearance of obftarles, which
either do not exill, or may be easily removed or
avoided.
The Remarker firfl obfervcs, that 'tÂ» not cei
tain that there isa quantity of water near themrr.-
dl* ground, fufhcicr.t for the navigation, without
I ving recourse to Furnace Creek and other dtl
t 11 waters, which will require great expense, and
t â  off the water from many watered meadows,
vi .h mull injure the owners of iliem.
1 arifwer, 1. 'Tis the decided opinion of those
who have been molt on the ground, and are best
acquainted wiih the futjeft, that there is a plenti
ful fuflkiency of waier near the crown land for
every nccdTary purpose.
2. But if a recourle to the dilbnt waters should
be expedient, even this is a very happy resort, and
the expence and fpoil.ng some watered meadows
are ohjrfts so small, that (hey bear not the lead
proportion to the infinite advantage of the great
concern.
But 3. The objeftion-with refpeft to the wa
tered meadows is real in but a very small degree ;
for the use of water on meadows is neaily confin
ed to the fore part of the year, previous to the
crops, at wh cii fcafon the waierwill not be want
ed in the canal ; that supply canor.lv be neceff ry
in the low state of the springs, which dots not
faappen till the fall of the year.
2. The Remarker next goes on :o observe, that
the inclined plane is used in Europe, by ma
chines which are woiked by hand without water ;
this is doubtless an argument in favor of the in
clined plane-, in cafe ihcte fiiould ever happen a
failure of water, but I suppose he doi s not mean
to fugged the expediency of working the machines
bv hind, when there is watef enotigh 10 carry
them ; in fbort we have no occasion to look for
expedients of what may or can be done without
water because 'tis a moll undoubted certainly,
that we can command water enough through the
vear for the tranfmifiion of a thousand boals a
day, of 40 tons each. This I conceive will be
quite enough for the present generation, and il
posterity should need more, we will leave them
to look for it, or to contrive ways and means of
domg without it.
3. The Remarker goes on to the diffi
Â«uhv of securing the water woiks and machinery
agamft frifhes and inundations, to which they
will be exposed ; but I conceive thi> is no greater
thanocours in all grift-mdlsor oth-r water works,
â¢which stand on the fame ftream,snd is too trifling
to deserve notice.
4. The Remarker goes on so recommend Mr.
Arthur Donaldfon's newly invented balance lock ;
1 admit this is an ingenious device, but is liable to
some small objections which I wilh the Remarker
so obviate.
1. The fchcnie bangs large czffoons (filled with
water, and into which the boats are to he drawn)
on to ihe arms of strong timbers like the dishes ot
a scale, which timber* aic lo vibrate on pivots like
scale beams, so that when one caffoon rises, the
other will fink, like the opposite diihes of a scaleâ
So far is verv well, but
2. 1 conceive the difficulty will be in hauling
the boats into and out of the caffoons, for in or
der to do this, the furface of the water in the caf
foons mult be on a level with the water in the
ponds or canals with which they must communi
cate ; but I conceive this level cannot be obtained,
for
g. The eaffoons must be of 3 or 4 feet height,
and of course the furface of the included water
will be then much higher than the bottom of the
caffoon, and when the lower caffoon finks foas to
touch the water below, it will go no further, tor
if it finks into the water, it will be buoyed by it,
and of course will be lightened so as not to retain
guvitation enough to raise the opposite caffoon
which hangs in the air, and of course they will
boih Hop; thelowtrone some feet above, and
the upprr '>ne equally below the furface of the se
veral ponds with which they must communicatc
before the boats can be hauled in or out of the
eaffoons.
4. Tnis plan requi ea an evcrlaflin;; equality of
furlace of water ir. the two ponds, both above and
below the dams over which ihe boats are to be
conveyed, lor the civo s on which the brfianc
beams iibrate fixed points, if you raise or
lower the furface or floor on which the dilhes reft,
you nrcclfaiily exali or depress the extreme end*
or aims ot the balance beams,either of which will
total'y dcAiov the operation of this plan, becaufc
it will unavoidably raise or depress the caffoon>
above or tÂ»eiow the furface ot the ponds with'
wh'chthcy must communicate, either to recent
in or diÂ£chatge the bests; but such equality cÂ»
Saturday, July 28, 179 2 -
fuiface can cever be obtained, for frefties will
raise, and droughts will dqprffs thofc fuifaces,
cnaugre all hoinao attempts.to prevent it.
If all these objections be got over, I
object further to the great complexity of the plan,
and the numerous difficult equations efiential to its
oprratior. and which mult be supported with
great-ejta&nefft, or the execution and use mult tail,
' Whereat the inclined p]<me and its machinery is
simple as a grift-mill, or even a cutlcr's gi ind
il.me and wheel ; is liable to none of the above:
objeaÂ«ons, and >s not atfrftrd by any different
heiftlulft or furtaces ot water, except extreme
rrefhes, which may perhaps futpeud the machi
nery a day or two 'till the water abates; this plan
i manifestly and intuitively practicable to the lar-
amount of fcÂ»le or extent that can be necel
iiry ; is equally adapted to boats of all sizes, Irotl
the largest to the foialleft, winch can be requ.ieo*
because the force can be adjusted to any quantity;
requiflte by increasing or diminifhii-g the water
let on to the wheel.
After all I perfcftly agree with the Remarkefj.
that Mr. Donation's plan and mine, and all ih<
reft proposed, ought lo be submitted to athial a
pcriment, under the dircftioi\of their feveial iu-s
ventors, which is really the only true telkâ¢ ot aÂ«i
inventions ol ihia fort.
The Remarket proceed* to object to my method
of condu&ing the navigation along the bed of ihe
creeks, and prefer* artificial canals nÂ» order uÂ»
avoid inundation, ice, See. See. which he think
the moll dangerous part of the whole concern, on
which permit me to observe : i. That the dig
ging a canal hxty miles in length, and large
enough for the purpote, will be the work o*
years, and
2. When done, will almost instantly henlcd
up again, unless it is all the way lin'd with wood,
or malonry, and pallages every where made under
or ovei it, to carry oil the deluges ot water, melt-;
ed snow, leaves weeds, See. which will frtquemly
come pouring down Irom the higher lands above
it ; and after all we can't be with ceitainty guard
ed against undermining the fides and bot
tom, which wiltoccafion a vail Ã¼bforphon cl wa
ter and probably carry oft large fpvces of the
works, and leave such holes and cavuies, as will
render repairs very expensive if not impracticable ;
the feveiity of froft, quantities of snow and delu
ge sos rain,the looknc'.s of the foil and poious na
;ure of the limeilone lands (:o all which ihe coun
try is every wheie fubjts) indicate all theic efFc. cts
and leave us no reason to tlut we can avoiti
I their aflual corifequence.
3. The natural beds of the Creeks are free from
all tbefe ineonvenences, th<*re is ltd otfngcfiVtkl
curient in the middle of any nullpoud Â»n the
higheit frclhes, and at the head and loot of every
dam (at one hundredth part of the expence of the
artificial canal) weean make piers and quays fut
ficient to secure the boats againfl any danger ol
floods or ice in the highetl frefbea that ever hap
pened ; the namral beds of the cretks have sup
ported the waters of them from the beginning of
ihe world, and will to the end of u ; our naviga
tion along these beds will lie from river to river,
through a course of dead ponds with little current
to incommode, and none to endanger '.he boa:.s.
4. There will be large room for all vessels to
pass and repafs, and all such to lie at anchor or
haul afliore, as may have occasion to stop either
for business or repairs.
5 In this way we can enlarge tne navigation
to any degree we pleafc, for if one set of ways and
machinery over the dams is not futftcieni ; we
may add two, three, four or five additional ones,
which may all be used at one, and the fame nine,
if the quantity of conveyance fhail make them ne
cefTary, and when we confidei that the proposed
navigation is defign'd for the principal communi
cation between a country of two jhoufand miles
extent and the Sea, we may soon expett to have
applications from an infinite number of boats, and
therefore ought to calculate our works on the
lar~cft scale to accomodate them.
6. The inclin'd plane and machinery will fit a
high dam equally as well as a low one, so that if
anv circumflances require some dams to be made
higher than others (which may probably be the
cafe) no inconvenience can follow ; for any bo2ts
in this wav can pass a dam of 20 feet high, as well
as one ot 6, 8, or 10 feet.âSome people have oh
j <fted to high dams because they flow meadow s,
out this is so trifling when compared to the im
portance of the great concern, that it vanifhrs in
to nothingâl don't conceive it will ever be ne
ceflary to draw the boats with horses, but if that
mode (hould be adopted, 'tis as easy to make a
horse load by the fide of the millpond as by the
Canal.
In fine the plan and execution of the works]
ought to embiace principl s of the greatest ftrcngth
and duration that the future trade may not be in
terrupted by decays or breaking ol the works and
repairs, and ought also to he calculated on the
gieatcft extent and scale poffihle that they may be
adequate to the vast, the iinmenfe occafious of
them.
Further I conccivc the plan and direflion must
be the work of one mind, divided councils and
opinions will coufume much time, introduce
inconsistency, and rum the uniformity of the
whole.
On tiir whole a good plan, grounded on prin
ciples of natural fitnefs, and a good beginning,]
with a g,ood choice of workmen, are half the
work. What remains is prudence, diligence, and
uniform perTevf ranee,ail ihefe will soon expedite
the works, and produce a happy conclusion.

Accounts were yellerday received
from the North of Ireland, of an un
fortunate dispute between the Pro
testants and the Catholics. The lat
j ter were going in procession to a fu
neral, with arms and colours flying.
The Protestants insisted on the co
lours being lowered, which tlie Ca
tholics relufed, and a general en
gagement took place. The Catholics
being defeated, rallied next day with
additional force, and their opponents
were defeated in their turn, owing
chiefly to a deficiency of ammunition.
Several perl'ons were killed on both

FIRE AT BARTON STAGEY.
Some people being at work at Mr.
Moody's shop, finith and edge-tool
maker, a large flake of red hot iron
flew out of the shop window, and fal
ling om some dry litter irear a cucum
ber-bed, set it iiiftantly on fire. This
communicating to an adjoining mill
houf'e, covered with thatch, where a
horse was at work, the whole in a
few minutes was in flames.
These premises being fnuated at
the northern extremity of the parish,
the wind high, awd blowing in a di
rect line with the flreet, carried the
thatch like a fibrin of fire, fwifter
than a man could run, from one house
to another, till the whole village was
in flames !
At one instant twenty feveti houses,
thirteen barns, ten ilables, several
granaries, and four ricks of capital
wheat, were in Hamts. The thatch
upon several extensive garden walls
was completely burnt up, with a
great number ef waggons, carts,
threshed and unthrefhed corn, twen
ty-eight pig s Â» 3 great quantity ot
poultry, and all the furniture and
entire property of great numbers of
poor people, who are reduced to the

fell in upon him.

BOSTON, July i 3.
Concentrating the various public ofHces in

celerates business, and of cour/e is greatl.v ad
vantageous to the commercial and manufac

the measure does not flop hereâthe repairs and
ornaments of the buildings add much to the
beauty of the street; and must impress foreign
ers, who enter' the town from the water, with
lavorable ideas of its wealth and confequertce.
Among; the ornaments above alluded to, a
| very bandfome one was added a few days f.nce
over the door of the Poft-Office. It is a wing
ed Mercury, in the ad of bounding from a
Globe, supporting his Caduceus in his left hand,
and holding ?n his right a letter directed to

ever, after the gentleman who fuffercd the loss
was asleep, he was awakened by a countryman,
who inquired, if he had loft a pocket-bookâand
being fatisfied with the replv, told the gentle

Mr. Fenno,
I HAVE been hitherto a silent observer of t'.ie
petulance displayed by the writers in the-
National Gazette, in conducting an oppolition to
the measures of the general government, and
its real friends; but their want of candor and
decency has proceeded to such a length, that I
mult now request a place in your paper for the
following remarks:
It appears evident from circumstances, and
the general complexion of the publications in
the National Gazette, that it is only the tool of a
faction, and the prostituted vehicle of party
spleen and oppolition to the great principles of
order, virtue and religion. The virulence and,
scurrility of the writers are truly chara&eriibc;!
but I could not have Itippofed them quite so
weak as they appear to be.. Do they imagine
that their puffing artifice in magnifying their
influence 011 the public mind has escaped detec
tion? Can they suppose that the cry of danger
which they have let up, has diliurbed the re
pole of the citizen ?, who feel their happiness,
;i.nd will not be bullied out of it?
The effrontery of these men is now so brazen,
that it glares upon every eye. The charge
which they make against others, recoil so
itrongly upon the/rtfeives, that nothing but
hackneyed prostitution can prevent them from
feeling it. Are they not, for example, the very
hirelings which they insinuate that others are?
Is not one of them profededlv retained in pay
under a department of the vCTy government
which they oppose ? Do they not difcovcr a spi
rit of intrigue, and that dark designing envy'
which sickens at superior abilities and fame in
others; While the National Gazette is pretended;
to be republican in its complexion, do not the
publications in it uniformly contradict the ge
nuine principles of liberty, by attempting to en
force the opinions of a junto, as those which are
to be of decisive authority with the nation, and
the wiih of the minority as that which is to
controul the majority?â They bellow loudly for
tSe Liberty of the Press; but, examine the
National Gazette, and fee if any thing in favor of
our national government is admitted into it,
while nothing against it appears to be refufed ;
and measures evidently calculated for the public
good are wilfully misrepresented, as in the cafe
of the poft-office law, merely to serve the pur
poses of party.
It is high time, Mr. Fenno, that the maJk
-vere torn from the faces of these profefled
iric:: di, but real enemies of the United States,
that their true features may be seenâthey
ought to be freely and fairly exposed to the
view of the world, that the public may be no
longer deceived by the ridiculous affectation of
those hypocritical republicans, those pretended
advocates for the liberties of the people.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
Mr. Fenno,
THE fame person who is Editor to the " Na
tional Gazette," receives a friary from
Government, for jiis Cervices as Tianilator.â
I suppose it is not disputed, that his service in
that duty answers its demand and expectation;
if ft>, surely there that bufinefi ends, and he, as
Editor to his press, left free (as I hope and ex
pect was always intended by government, as
well as himiif.j Hut Mr. T. L. from lome
idea, compared with himlelf, fecms to think
otherways Perhaps he will thank some one to
help him out in his publication, and fay for him;
t lat he himfelf is for /ale, and at how low a
price; this I can venture to do for himâbut
how he wiM jet the quality of his goods recom
mended, may be a dillicult question. A. Z.

that a gentleman from Hifpaniola informs, that

taken many French merchantmen in the Weft-

lifax, North-Carolina.
Accounts from Mai tinico, via Boston, inform
oi great disturbances in that Island. On the
6th June, the troops stationed at St. Pier res, it
is laid, revolted. The General, with ibme
troops and ships ol war, went down from Port-
Royal. This threw tiie town into confufion,
and the people run to armsâthe troops, it
seems, embarked 011 board several vefiels, injift
ing on being sent to France June 11. The in
habitants were still under arms, and will conti
nue so till the troops are failed. These soldiers
it appears, are all friends to the Revolution, ex

who are firm Ariltocrats.

PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.
AN EXTRACT.
'â¢ THAT the Legislature is supreme, fÂ»
long as the conltttution of government lalts.
2. That the executive department 01 govern
ment is alone to enforce laws, but has no autho
rity to res use a compliance with tLem, more
than any other individual*
3- That the whole body of the people is alone
competent to controul the legiilature.
4- That this cannot be done but by difiolviag
the government.
5. That every law which in its consequences
will not destroy and that very immediately the
rights of man, had better be enforced and the
repeal ot it obtained in the constitutional mode.
This follows from the principle, that the lelier
inconvenience always ought to be adopted. 4

JOSEPH LEWIS,
(iaw'7wjFrom an Zvgiijk To ft r
PRINCE POTEMKIN.
THlSPrince, according to the mili
tary law of Russia, served as all
otheryoung Noblemen do, a few years
Serjeant in tlie Em pre Is s guards,
and at length received Lhe com million
of an officer. Fortunately lor Russia,
her Imperial Majelty continually re
wards merit, an<l her feletfting the
Prince is a proof of the Sovereign s
great discernment.
The early pait of the Prince's life
was dedicated to extreme ftndy ; and
during the last war again ft the Turks,
he diltinguilhed himfelf under the
orders of Field Matihal Romanzoff.
At the commencement of the war
in 1788, his Highness was appointed
to the command of the army agailifl
the Turks. After repuFfing the ene
my at Kinglmrn, he pitched his camp
before OtzakofF, besieged that strong
fortrefs four months ; and though
during the lafl fix weeks there was
frequently 20 degrees of frofl, and a
very deep snow, took it, to his im
mortal renown, by storm ; on the
17th of December. His Highnefs's
other great contjuefts, in the years
1789 and 1 T9O, are so generally known,
that it is uuneceflary to enumerate
them here ; â and I have no doubt
but his humanity to his numerous
prifuners has been long ago publish
ed ; for it was his firft care, after his
wounded men, to fee himfelf that the
unfortunate were supplied with eve
ry poflible comfort. He was beloved
by the army.
Now let us view him as a Statef
man,and we find bim a great patriot
110 fubjert has ever existed, who
had the unlimited power of Prince
Potemkin. Her Imperial Majefly's
well-judged confidence had made him
almighty in her immense dominions;
and notwithstanding all this power,
since his death, his few envious ene
mies have declared that he never ren
dered a man unhappy.
The Ruffians have long enjoyed
the fruits of the inaiuifatflories he
commenced and parronifed. If the
matter of any art was to be purcha
sed from u foreign country, there
was a general order from his High
ness to secure him at any expense,
out ot his own private fortune. He
would have fuflicient proof given that
the Ruffian Cabinet is not to be out
inanceuvred, ill which dexterity the
Prince bore a considerable (hare. In
the arts and fcienccs he was a con
noisseur, his tafle in architecture has
been jnftly admired by all our fo
reigners ; latterly he paid great at
tentioil to naval architecture, and
was cfieemed a competent judge of a
faip of war,
Jlis Highness had never travelled
out of Ruffra â¢ yet upon hearing his
fconverfation, one might have conclu
ded that he had vifiied every corner
of the globe. His memory was equal
to his information ; his ideas were
fnblime, as his power was great. Her
Imperial Majesty, who has much la
jnented his death, declared in tears
on receiving the melancholy news,
that flie had loft a faithful friend.
