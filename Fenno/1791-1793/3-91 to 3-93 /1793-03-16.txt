CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, March l.
In committee of the whole, Mr. Muhlenberg
in the chair, on the 3d, 4th, sth, 6th, 7th,
and Btb resolutions, refpefting the official
conduct of the Secretary of the Treasury,
tor which fee Gazette of the 6th ir.lt.
MR. MERGER. None of the communi
cations from filte Secretary of the Tie a
fury, he said, had removed his fnfplcions re
lative to the tranfaÂ£lionsefthat department;
Xvrhat had fallen ill the course of the diffcuffion
tiad not removed his doubts. He> confefied
liimfelf niore at a loss than ever to account
for the conciuft of that officer. To judge of
the propriety of his conduct, it was neceifary
ta conftder what his duties are, and inyefti
gate-whether a necessity exiflc-d tojuftify the
drawing complained of. Gentlemen In their
arguments had alluded to (bine obleryations
(hat had fallen from him 00 other occaficms
expressive ol'liis opinionâthat tbere had been
â¢corruption ip that department. This opinion
he ftiil entertainedâHe fuggafej that fbtne
irregularities had, he belifcved, taken place as
to the money appropriated to the linking
fund. This might l>e tlie fact, a-nd his sus
picions were Sufficiently urgent to warrant
him in suggesting, that it might be possible.
At the close of ninety-two he slated there was
a balance of calh in the treasury of 2,331,182
dollar ; and the bonds due in the course of
the prelent year would produce a sum of a
bout 2,269,000 dollarsâYet a proposition
was made 111 the House, predicated on a total
want of money in the treaftiry, to borrow
800,000 dollars in addition to the 400,000 al
re'Jfly borrowed of the bank.
Here Mr. Boudinot interrupted the mem
ber, as beiiuT out of order.
Trie Chairman, conceiving Mr. Mercer's
remarks to We mtroduftory to, and connected
with t:ie observations he intended to make
on the rrfoiution, declared him iu order.
Mr. Mercer proceeded to shew, by sundry
ftarements and calculations, that there was
no ncceflity for this loan of 800,000 dollars.
The House, he laid, to discharge their duty,
Ihould be bow the supftey appropri
ated was applied, before they contented to re
peated additional appropriations. When calls
for information had been made by the House,
with a view to comply with this their indif-
P+nlible duty, the Secretary had thought it
Sufficient to balance money actually received,
by calculations of fuins that would probably
be wanted agreeably to appropriationsâ>â
Were dollars, he asked, to be balanced by ob
solete appropriations ? can things certain be
balanced by things Uncertain ?Â«âAftual ex
penditure would alone balance actual receipt.
-Appropriations founded only on uncertain
calculations could not shew the money actu
ally laid out. He adverted to foine calcula
tions made to ascertain the probable expen
ses of the war department.
Here the member was again called to or
der, and was declared out of order by the
Chairman.
Mr. Mercer confined his obrervations more
immediately to the resolution before the
committee. It had been said that the inter
est paid was paid out of monies that were to
be drawn to this country, and were replaced
Here by funds from the domestic refourccs
originally appropriated for that object, and
that the dead letter of the law, if any part
of it, had alone been violated. He conteud
cd there had been an elfential violation.
The sums drawn for and appropriated to.
reduce the public debt, were not applied to
that purpose ; the domestic resources appro
priated to that obje&} never were exhaufied.
if this is the cafe, conclusions surely unfa
vorable to that officer must naturally follow.
He proceeded to make some remarks on
the question, whether the Secretary had act
ed under inftrudtions from the President. It
was disagreeable, he premised, to criminate
Ihe character of any officer. He bore a great
re pest for the President, for his virtues* ta
lents, and services, but however grating to
ins feelings it might be to find fault with any
part erf his conduct in this business, he was
unable to discharge his duty Under his present
lrnpreUions, unless he avowed that he con
ceived that officer had violated the law,
though he allowed, without intention, by not
ciiquiiing into the business, while tranfafting,
was his duty to do. He imift declare
Â»at he saw no proof that the Secretary Had
â¢Â«ed under the President's mftiÃttions ; on
tne contrary he saw the reverse, there was
â¢veil no preemptive proof of the atf.â'The
House bad called for information as to the
Extent of the authority delegated in the bufi
tvefs by the President to the Secretary. Ei
ther the Secretary has produced the proof of
this authority, or he has not complied with
he order of the House jâit does appear that
ne has gone beyond it in making the drafts
complained of. The President dire&ed that
t e proceeds of the loan be immediately ap
Â¥ 'ed to pay the French; yet a Â£reat portion
Saturday, March 16, 1793.
of that money was brought over here, It
was said, that he might have brought the.
whole here, it" he chose, and paid it to the
French here. This argument goes oÂ» the
preemption, he observed, that the Prcfident
might do wrong without incurring blame.
But the Preftdent expressly dire&ed. it to be
paid immediately to France ; and tile Houfeii
had np right toprefume that he did direct the!/
money to be drawn here, when proof to the'
contrary appears. Upon the whole, he con-,
eluded that the law had been broken in letter
and substance, and that the Secretary had,<
acted without proper infti uftimis from the
President.
Mr. Liverfnore dWerved, that the charges
againfl the tieafury department were at firll
well calculated to beget feripus alarm. When
misapplications of the public money arefouud
ed in the public ear, atl feel interested, know
ing, that what *ffe<fts the public purse, mv)ft
In a degree atfeft the purses of each private
individual. In the prelent stage of tbe bufj
nefs, he was happy in being able to felicitate
himfelf and his fellow-citiaens, that even
should the whole of til? charges contained in
the reCblutions be proved, it would qot ap
pear that they had loft a farthing by the bu
siness Co loudly complained of. What is the
charge? That the Secretary has paid an in
terest that was juflly due ; why then, he pre
sumed, we should not have it again to pay.
If the Secretary has paid what was due, what
then U the complaint ? It was Purely not in
tended, that it Ihould not have been paid.
This was not the intention of Congress j for
they palfed an ast providing funds for its pay
ment ; the Secretary was then rignt to pay
it. But it is said, he paid it With the wrong
money; he law no harm in not paying it with
the very dollars appropriated, and approved
of the operation, which, saved drawing with
the one hand and remitting witn the other j
in this there was no crime committed, no
loss incurred. It appears, on the contrary,
that Something was gained by it: So Far then,
he was clear, no law had been violated, nor
was any rule of propriety departed fromâ
He then touched upon the Secretary's dis
puted right to draw. He contended, that he
had that right. The loans were obtained
under the joint authority of the two acts.
It vu fakl that more than two millions, tlie
amount appropriated for the finking fund,
were drawn over ; but, he infilled, he might
have drawn the other twelve millions, if it
had been for the public interest so to do.
The French wished to be paid here, and it be
ing no loss, rather a profit to comply with
their wifb, where was the harm io So doing i
If any public loss had been incurred owing to
these drafts, then blame would lie. He con
cluded, by expreffiug his hearty approbation
of the conduct of the officer who is crimina
ted by the refolu'ions, and declared it as his
firm intention to give them Iris negative.
Mr. Smith regretted that so important an
enquiry had been instituted at the very clo e
of the fefHbn, when the members were throng
ed with business of an indispensable nature,
and it was scarcely poilible for them to beftovr
that attention and deliberation, which the na
ture of the business called for. But, while he
expressed this regret, he aflured the commit
tee that it was mingled with muÂ£h fatisfafti
on in finding that the vague charges of mis
management, with which the public had long
been alarmed, were at length cast into a shape,
susceptible of investigation and decifiom
Previous to an examination of the fpeclfic
charge then under Â«onfideration, he clainicd
the indulgence of the committee, in ottering
a few preliminary remarks, which, though
they did not bear precisely iijoii the charge
itfelf, yet were intimately connected with
the fubjea-matter of the enquiry, and were
juftified by thegeueral remarks of gentlemen,
who had preceded liirn.
In recurring bsck to the origin and progress
of this examination, be said, it must appear
somewhat surprising, that that, which, in the
commencement of the felfion, was founded
forth as gross speculation, now turnec 1 out to
be nothing more than a mere substitution of
funds, and that that which was announced as
abominable corruption, was dwindled away
into a mere drawing of money from Europe
into this country, to be applied here accord
ing to law.
Whatever credit might be due to the mo*
tives which had originated this enquiry,every
member would concur in the sentiment, that
in a government constituted like that of the
United Stater., wfiich had nothing but the pub
lic confidence for its basis, premature alarms
and groundless iufoicions refpe&'ng the con
due* of public officers, were pregnant with
the most injurious con frequences.
This opinion was more peculiarly applica
ble to the important flation of the Secretary
of the Treafuvy. En tr lifted with the ma
nagement of a large revenue, and necefTarily
cloathed with some latitude of difipretion, it
was to be expe&ed that he would excite the
jealousy of the public vigilance ; but as long
as he kept in view the injunctions of law, and
the public good, his reputation was entitled
to that'fecurity which is due to every citizen.
329
inoficer, entrusted with the tare and dif
tribtirion of public monies, is generally looked
aewitb a Watchful eye; mankind are too
pÂ« one to fufpe<ft the purity of his conduct J
flight insinuations are but too- often fuflicient
to injure him in the public eftiination. Such
being the natural propensity of things it
doubt ess behoved thole who wi'flied for tran
quility In the country, to withhold
not clearly warranted by proofâto suspend
animadversions which were not likely to ter
minate in convi&ion. A contrary proceed
ing had an inevitable tendency nnnecelfarily
to alarm the public mind-, to inlt 1 into it i\i(-
picions agkirtft the integrity of men in high
stationsâto weaken their public confidence
in the government, and to enervate its opera
tions.
There wan something remarkable in the
nature of the present allegations against the
Secretary; taking them all into view, they
presented nothing which involved leli-inter
efted pecuniary considerations ; and in this,
they essentially differed from accusations a
gainst financiers in other countries, to whom
motives of interell were generally ascribed
tb*fource of their peculations. T<> s he
Secretary no such motive was imputed ; not
withstanding former inlinnations againlt his
integrity, the Jum of all the chargcs now a
moimted to nothing more than arrogance, or
an aflumptioii of power, or an exercile of un
authorised discretion.
With refpeft to discretion, Mr. Smith ob
served, that though in the present enquiry it
was not neceflary to fay much on that topic,
being firmly persuaded the Secretary had
ftri&ly pursued the injunctions of law, yet,
while on the fubjedf, he took occasion to in
sist that in all governments a latitude was
implied in executive officers, where that diPÂ»
creation resulted from the nature of the office,
or was in purltiance of general authority de
legated by law. This principle was so obvi
ous that it required no illustration ; were it
contraditted, he tvould appeal to the conduct
of the Secretary of State, who, though direct
ed to report to the Houfb on the commercial
intercoutte with foreign nations, had, in the
exercise of a Warrantable discretion judicious
ly withheld his report : lie would appeal to
the report of the committee on the failure of
St. Cifiir's expedition, tv herein that failure
was in pare attributed to the commanding ge
neral's not being inverted with a discretion to
ast according to circumstances.
There was one more observation which he
thought proper to preijiife before he entered
into a difcufiion of the charges ; and that
was the diladvantageous lituation in which
the financier of this country was placed,when
compared with that of fimiiar officers in other
nations. TheminiHerof finance in Great-
Britain being always a member of the !egifla
ture and on a footing with other members,
was prepared to defend himfelf when attack
ed Â» no charge could be made his ad
ministration, which he had not an immediate
opportunity of and the charge and
the refutation went out to the A?orld toge
ther. The Secretary of the Treasury was on
the contrary not even permitted to come to
the and to vindicate himlelf* Through
the imperfedt medium of written reports he
was compelled, when called upon for informa
tf6n, to anfwerj as it were, by anticipation,
charges whif:h were not fpecific, without
JcHowfng pretifely agaiuft what part of his ad
ministration fubfeqnent fpecilic clmfges would
be Wought to bear.
If in his reports he Wastdtjcife* he was cen
sured for fuppreffirig information Jif he en
tered into a vindication of the motives which
influenced his qonduft, he Vas then criminat
ed for fluffing his reports With metaphyseal
reafb:rings. A gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. Findley) had said that the Secretary's
repots were so voluminous that he Was quite
bewildered by them, and that instead of their
throwing any light on the fubjett, he was
more in the dark than ever. It is truej the
repdtts were voluminous, but not more so
than the imputations on the Secretary's con
duct, and the ciders of the House juftifieck
He did not think that any member who had
attentively perused thein, could juftlV com
plain of want of information, or of being more
in the dark than before i he on the contrary
believed, that so much light had been thrown
on the whole of the Secretary's si cal operati
ons, that if any member Could not fee it piuit
be owing to the glare of light being too itrong
for Ins eyes,
Harirg made tbst obfbrvations,Mr. Smith
said he ffiould proceed to examine tlie fii ft
charge, which, after much reÃeftion bellowed
upon it, afrpearcd to him to contain nothing
that was not autborifid by tlÂ»e ltridt krtter oi
the law.
Mr. Smith, in his examination of the charge
inder conlideration, observed that it collid
ed* of two items : the firfl, ihe application
of a certain portion of the p'. incipalfum bor
rowed in Europe, to the payment of the in
terest falling due upon that principal, which
it was contended was nor authorifeJ by any
law} Hialecoud, The drawÂ«g ;art of the
[Whole No. 40 5.]
fame monies into the United States* without
the inftradHoiis of the Pieiident.
ThÂ«f drit item of i hi* luppofed violation of
law appeared ot so frivrffout a nature* that it
did oot merit much difmfiioo ; at any rate, it
was more an objeÃi6ii ot form than ot f'ubttance.
It he comprehended well the purpott Ot the
charge, it was nothing more thin thisâthat the
fccietafy, having tnmiiei at his disposal in tu
rope applicable to the purchase of Hock in tin*
country, and having at the lame wine monies in
this coUntry applitable to the payment of the
mteteit abroad, had fubflituted the one tor the
Other; he had paid the tortrigri inteieft out of
the foreign funds, and he had purchased (lock
with the domeftie funds.â ThiJ was iht
heinous crime with which he waa charged*
and which was thought tufHcient to re
move him from office ! If the money in
V Europe might have beeu drawn to this
country by biHs, for the purchase of the
debt, it injght hpvb equally been
here, by ordering the application,of a lunj.
there (in Europe) fi?i a purpose which
would be represented by an equal fori*
here, to be applied to the purchase. The
substance, not the form, iÂ»to decide whe
ther this mode of negociating the bufincts
Wast proper. Suppose bills had been or
dered to be drawn on the comroiflioners,
and remitted to them, on account of the
foreign interelt, would not this hav.e l)e<fi>
as regular as to draw them for sale? Did
the execution of the law require, that tl>e
secretary, having funds in Europe, with
which the foreign interest might be disc
charged, should neverthelefe remit monies
abroad for that put pose, and then, having
funds in this country, with which the pur
chases of the debt might be made, should
draw bills to bring the foreign funds here/
Was there any necessity foj this complex
operation, for the expence of remittance
the probable loss on the sale of bills, the
loss of interelt while the money was in
tranfitu, when the whole business could be
negociated by limple and (Economical
tnode puvfued ? So fat from this arrange
ment beir.g a ground of cenfufe, Mr.
Smith alerted that, had the fecretaty
pursued the other mode, he would have
been animadverted Upon with great seve
rity, for such an absurd and eXpeufivc
operation ; (re would have been accused us
ignorance of his dqty, and every loss in
cidental to the tranfa&ion would have
been charged to his account.
The fecoild divilion of the charge, btf
ing of more magnitude, requited a mofe
lengthy difcuffiom This instance of vio*
lation confided in a supposed deviation
from the inductions of the Prefitjent, of
a supposed aftiag without any inftru&iotf
whatever. It was, however, begging thi
queition j it was taking for granted that
which did not appear, and which ought
not to be presumed, And here Mr. Smith
observed, the gentlemen on the other fide
had entitely reversed one of the funda
mental maxims of criminal jurisprudence,
which declared that innocenct should be
presumed, and guilt proved ; wherta>
they had presumed guilt, and called uport
the accused to piove hi* innocence.
And what Was the slender bafts on
which the presumption was built ?
fay the gentlemen, the inftrudlions from
the Prtfident to the Becietary, which
have been laid before the houie, relate
only to the payment of the French dibtÂ«
and convey no authority to draw any of
the foreign loan into this country for the
purchase of (lock, and hence they infer,
he had no authority for this latter pur
pose.
To comprehend the fallacy of the in
ference, it was only neceflary to recur to
the laws, and to the Prtfidei.t'scommilfi
on to thrf fecrttary to negociate the loanFj
Two aAsof Congress had palled j one
the 4th of Abgutl, the other the 12th
Augufl, 1790. The fitit authorised a
loan of 12 millions of dollars, applicable
to the payment of the French debt; the
other a loan of 2 millions, applicable to
the purchase of the domeftie debt. The
Piefident's commiflion to the secretary
embraced both acts and both objtdis, and
under that commiliion one loan was nego
ciated applicable to both objedts. True
it is thai the Prelident's firit inftru&ionawere confined to one object, namely, the
French debt ; but the inference is not,
that no other inftruftions were given, and
that the secretary acted without authori
ty, but the very reverse, that the Preli
dent either left the other object to the
general discretion of the secretary, who
was, ex officio, the proper agent, and his
representative ; or that he teferved it for
subsequent and occasional inftruftions.
This inference must be the true one :
firft, because a contraiy supposition would
impute to the President an illegal inten
tion, that of applying all the monies bor
roÂ«id under both acts to the object ot
one only ; secondly, because the coramif
fion extending to the borrowing 14 milli
on and embracing both objects, and the
inftruftions being confined to 12,000,000
and to only one object it followed that the
other either was left to discretionary ma
nagement, or to after regulation, for the
law ertjoined the execution of both.
If-prefumption then W3S to govern, the
more natural presumption was, that the
officer acted according to some gtneral
discretion rcpofed in him, or according
to inftruftions from time to time given.
These inftruftions may have been verbal,
as well as written. The written instruc
tions given in the firft instance were evi
dently confined, to the object of the firft
ast; the neccfiary concliifion was, .that
the application of.the monies borrowed
under the second ast was not meant to-be
included in the inftruftions, but Was left
to be tegulated by a general discretion,
01 by occasional direction s, verbalor other
wise. . '
To presume that the secretary acted
without the fanftion of the President,
was to suppose that the President was to
tally ignorant of the application of any
part of the loan to the purchase of the
debt.
But there is in the poflefiion of the
house abundant testimony of the Presi
dent's privity and co-operation.
I ft. In his speech to both houses, iir
December 1790, in announcing the loan,
he expressly refers to its being made by
virtue of both a&s, thereby implying
clearly that it had reference to the objetts
of both. He therein likewise refers the
house to a further communication from
the secretary, on that fubjeft.
2dly. The secretary, puifoant to that
reference informed the house, in the name
and by order of the President, that a part
of the loan, to wit. 150,000 florins, was
applied in payment to France ; another
part to wit 160,000 florins, to the Dutch
debt; and that it was deemed highly ad
vifeable to apply the residue to the pur
chase of the debt, if Congtefs wpuld re
move a doubt as to the terms on which
the loan had been negociated.
Congress did remove that doubt- by
their ast of March 179 1.
It followed then of course, that the re
sidue would be applied according to the
intimation given ; it was so understood
/on all hands, and the money being to be
inverted in this country, it likewise follow
ed of course, that it must be drawn here ;
a contrary conduct would have been cen
surable. And yet, notwithstanding these
fa&s, though the President had informed
the house asfarback asDec. lyyb.thatthc
loan had been a conjundt loan under the
authority of both adts, and consequently
for both objedts, though at the fame time
he had referred the house to the fecietary
for further information, in relation to that
loan and its applicability, though the se
cretary had in the name and by order of
the President informed the house by his
report in February 179 1 that only a part
of the money borrowed had been applied
to the French and Dutch debt, and that
the residue would be applied to the pur
chase of stock, as soon as Congress re
moved the doubt, though Congress pafled
a law expressly to remove that doubt, yet
it had been gravely and earnestly conten
ded, that the secretary was not authoris
ed to apply any part of that money to the
purchate of stock, that it was done with
out the fandiion of the President, & that
Congress, until the late call for informa
tion, were totally ignorant of the applica
tion of any part of it to that object.
.There was then the fulleft and mod fa
tisfadlory evidence of the privity and con
currence of the President, in confirmation
of the evidence resulting fiom official rela
tion. â¢
, Between the chief magistrate and his
immediate agents, either a general discre
tion or inftriiftions must be presumed, be
caufc it is presumable he will do his duty,
and punish where either a discretion has
not been allowed, or inltruftions hare not
been given, or where his inftruftiont
have'been contravened.
The argument on the other fide implies
in the chief magistrate either ignorance 6T
neglcft of duty ; on the one hand that he
was unacquainted with the tranfaftion,
or on the other, that being acquainted he
acquiesced in a violation of law without
removing the tianfgreffor. Could it be |
seriously Olid, would it not be abfucd to
suppose that an operation of such extent,
provided for by law, communicated to
both houses, notorious to all the ratr
chants of Philadelphia and New-York, as ;
that of drawing and felling the bills on
Europe, was unknown to the President?
Mu(l he not have been wsll acquainted
with these tranfadtions, and that Without
daily frequenting ihe coffee-houfe, as some
of his friends lately advised him ?
If the infttuftions or the intentions of
the President had been contravened,would
he not have vindicated his own authority
by removing the officer ?
But it had been objected that bills
were drawn previous to the fanftion of
the legislature by the confirmatory ast of
March 179 1.
Admit the fail, and there was nothing
reprehensible in it. It appears from the
fit ft general inltruftions to- Mr. Short, in
August 1790, that the Secretary 1 consider
ed ordinary charges, and 5 per cent, in
terest as within the meaning-os the law.;
Pursuing this confttuftion, and bfilief
ing it to be very important to the general
operations of the treasury, he drew for
the money, reserving himfelf as to the fi
nal application for an adt of the house ic
movirig the doubt.
The drawing for the money was a mere
intermediate step, which amounted neither
to a breach, nor to a fulfilment of the law,
which was wholly silent on that point.
The application was the criterion whe
ther the law had been fulfilled or nor. If
the legislature had not removed the doubt,
the money would have been remitted back
for the foreign object, and from the re
lative price of public and private bills
without loss, probably with advantage. It
was prudent in the mean time to place it
where it was likely to be this
was done. ) '
It was indeed remarkable that all the
points now railed as objections were made
known in the report before alluded to of
February 1791, as things done or intend
ed ; no objection was then made or dreimt
It had been asked, why have the, in.
ftruftiuns not been produced, if any ex
iftÂ«d ?
The call had been ooly for copies of au
thorities ; the inftru&ions may have been
verbal. The Secretaiy in his report on
loans informed the house, " that besides
the firft geneial inftruftions, the trust re
posed in him was to be regulated by jfub
fequentand occasional diredtions." A mo
tive very honorable to him might be af
figtied for his not bringing forward the
Prelident's inftrudlions as a cover. Rely
ing that the province of the house was to
examine into the effe&s of measures, their
conformity to law and the public good,
ami that the necessary executive inftrtifti
ons were to be presumed, the Secretary
had evidently chosen to implicate the Pre
sident as little as pofllble. ;
The order requested the President to
lay before the house copies of the autho
rities dire&ing the application of the mo
nies borrowed ; it was evident that the
Prelident construed this order into a call
not for the inftrudtions from him to the
Secretary, but for the inftru&ions from
the Secretary to his agents, because in the
report made in pursuance of that order,
the Secretary presents, by order of the
President, his own letters, to Messrs. Short,
Willink and Van Staphorft, as the au
thorities to apply the proceeds of the
loans. It followed therefore, that the pa
per relied on was not intended to be given
as the only inftrudtion refpefting the ap
plication of the loan ; the interference
from it was coofequently erroneous.' The
'President could never conceive that the
house meant to call for his private induc
tions from time to time imparted to his
immediate agent under the words "of the
resolution : that link must have been pre
furned ; he therefore diredted a transmissi
on of the authorities ffom the Secretary
to his agents.
But what has the want or breach of in
ftruftions to do with the breach of the
law ? Suppose no inftiuclions given, or
330
the Inftru&tons tiot putfued, *nd yet sup
pose the law to have been completely
purlued, could it be said there was any
breach of law ? or suppose inftru&ions
given and ftriftly pursued, ami the law
to have been depaited from, would the
adherence to inttru&ions have- jullihed
that departure ?
Either what was done was nugatory, or
it would have been agreeable to law ; to
affirm the contrary, would be to confound
two things perfedtly diftinft, inilru&ions,
and laws.
The resolution imports that the secre
tary has violated the law of the 4th of
A>ugo(t 1790, by not pilrfuitig the in
ftruftions of the President ; that law is
silent as to inftruftions ; it does not re
quire that the President shall give instruc
tions to the secretary, nor doe's it require
that the secretary (hall be alone guided by
the inftru&ions of the President ; it only
dire&s the President to cause a certain
sum to be borrowed, and leaves it to him
to cause a proper application to be made
of the proceeds.
The drawing money into this country,
with or without authority, to apply it to
the purchase of the debt cannot be deem
ed a violation of the law of the 4th Au
gust, for it was not loaned under the au
thority of that acl alone, but under the
joint authority of the two a&s; if any
thing is meant by the resolution, it oughc
to mention both the acts.
To go furthei, Mr. Smith infilled that
the Secretary had, virtute officii, a legal
authority to apply the monies, when bor
rowed, according to law, without inflec
tions.
The loans might have been made in
the United States as well as abroad ; sup
pose them obtained of the bank of Boston,
would it have been criminal for the Se
cretary, without inftru&ions, to have
drawn the money to the places where it
would be most advantageously invested ?
Suppose the loan obtained of the bank of
the United States, would it have been
deemed irregular to have, without in
ftru&ions, issued a wartant to place it
in the treasury ? Why was it more irregu
lar or more criminal to draw it from
abroad as a preliminary step ?
The moment the foreign loans were ne
gociated, and the monies paid into the
hands of the Secretary's agents abroad,
from that moment they became as much
utjder his controul and fupenntendance,
fubjeft to legal appropriation, as any mo
nies in the tteafury.
'Twas not necessary to establish this po
sition, that the fubjeft of foreign loans
should have been specially mentioned in
the co'nftitution of the treasury depart
ment..
Many things resulted collaterally from
the general ftru&ure of an institution
which were not expressed in it.
He did not however intend, that the
doctrine here advanced, (hould touch the
question astowhat official propriety might
have required between the chief magif
trate-and(the Secretary. 'Twas the point
of legality only, which he meant to exa
mine.
In all executive functions, relating to
the finances, the Secretary must be consi
dered as the agent of the President, and
the legislature must- take it for granted,
where the contrary is not manifeft, that
the relation has been properly attended
to ; justice to both characters di&ated the
presumption. â¢
It clearly resulted from these remarks ;
ift, that there was no ground to infer ei
ther want of inftrudtion or breach of in
ftruftion, but diteftly the reverse.
2dty. It as clearly resulted that if there
was, it would not follow that therp had
been a violation of law.
Having gone through this resolution,
Mr. Smith observed, that if there was as
little of criminality in the subsequent char
ges as in that which he had just difcufied,
and from an attentive examination he fiti
cerely believed it, he was fatisfied that
notwithllanding all the severe animadver
sions within, and all the virulent calumny
without the walls of Congress, the cqndnft
of the Secretary would come forth chaste
and unblemished, itiftead of any thing be
ing dete&ed which would disgrace Pan
demonium, nothing could be chargeable
to him, which wouid fully the purest an
gel in heaven. Whatever difference of o
pinion might exist as to the wisdom and
benefit of his meafutes, he was confident
in faying that in every thing the Secreta
ry had done, he had been guided by prin
ciples honorable and patriotic, and he
frirfted that a very preat majority of the
committee would by their votes evioce the
fame fentiinent.
The sword of justice, it wa, Uid, ought
at times to be taken from tbe scabbard to
keep great public fun&ionaries within the
pale of the law, but it should be remem
bered that if justice had its sword to nti
ni(h the guilty, it had liltewlfe its fticld
to protest the innocent. If the Secretary
had committed a wanton violation of law
let the sword be drawÂ» forth forfcispimiQ,.
ment ; but if he had purfurd the
of an enlightened patrtotifin, the com
mittee were called upon to raise the fTtic'd
for the defence of a faithful officer. ' V
Mr. Hillhoufe argued, that the inter,
eft paid was not paid out of the 2,000,000
loan; and that the drafts were madca<*rec
ably to the dire&ions of the President
He (hewed this by the documents which
had been already referred 10.
He put in a cleat point of visw the
propriety of avoiding the expence and
ri(k of drafts and correspondent remittan
ces ; and concluded by giviug his appro
bation to the condud of the Secretary in
the tranfa&ions complained of, and by
exprefiing it as his firm beliefâthat a ma
jority of the committee, from the evi
dence before them, would undoubtedly
be of opinionâthat the charges brought
forward are unfounded.
Mr. Sedgwick rose to correct a mltlake
of Mr. Mercer's. That gentleman had
aflerted, that the Secretary had drawn on
Europe, before the loan obtained bythe
commifiion*rs under the old government
was ratified. This was not the cafe, he
said ; the loan had been ratified in purfu.
ance of the provisions of the ast author
ing it. The President, in his speech on
the Bth of .Dec. 1790, fays, " that agree
ably to the powers vested in him at the lad
feflion, the loans in Holland had been
completed."
By existing acts of the legifiature, and
from express communications from the St.
cretary of theTreafury, it appears, that
all the monies borrowed were deemed as
borrowed under the joint authority of
both adts, and not to be solely appropria
ted for the payment of the foreign debt,
Mr. Mercer explained, that he had said
that the Secretary had drawn from the
loan obtained under the authority of the
old government, before said loan was le
galized by law. If the legiftattifi had
a right to legalize it, they had the right
to reject it.

In times like the present, when the principle!

is interesting which tends to confirm or contra

nations received who have adopted the opinions
of this new philosophy. There is so much good
sense in the following, and it is so applicable to
the present times in this country, that we have
thought proper to give the article a very conspi

" WE have already remarked, that the level

Â« The firft instance of this appears in the ad
dress from the inhabitants of Mayencc, 10 which
they declare a desire of adhering to their ancient
conrtitution, modified however with fomc ( trm'ng
alteration, whicb they had formerly petitioned
from their former sovereign. Frankfort has ma

MR. DUNLAP,
LISTENING the other day in Congress, with
many other citizens, 10 the numerous proofs
of mal-adminidralton and corruption that were
to have been adduced againd the Secretary of the
Treasury, I was pleated when Mr. Mercer roseâ
because, it was presumed that he, who .bad uni
formly spoken of the Treasury Department as a
renovated Psndemonium, would now-givfcus
the proof pafiMvc. The pioof of cortuptiofl"
was in his pocket ; he drew it forth, prefertted
it to public view,- and laid it on tlie'table for
private infpeflion and public information. It
was a paper figtied by' Mr. Benjamin. Hawkins,
in the letters and characters following, viz.â
" The observations I made in the Senate, on the
motion to order the commiffionersof the finking
fund to lav their proceedings before the Senate,
were, that I undeiflood the fund in its original
creation, to be for tfie purpose of railing the
price of funds :o their true valueto call it a
finking fund, was a misnomer. That a gentle
man, during ihe'laft session of Congress, who is
not now in the United States, informed me in
conversation, that he and some others had sent
in proposals at 17s. and a fraftien, and at 18s.
and a small fraflion ; that the whole of the low
ell was not taken, and that fotne of the highest
was. That I dated this information by way Of
quere, to the Frefident of the Senate, who could
put me right, if the information 1 had dated
was otherwise. That the Prefidctlt answered,
that he never knew that they purchased other
than at the lowed market price. B. H.
27th Feb. 1793. '
" N. B. The gentleman alluded to abovej' waÂ£
JÂ»lr. Buchanan." v
Such is the proof of vitality and corruption, â 
words of dreadful import, that have been ring,
ing in our ears lor Several months. Fronp all
which it appears, that a ceitain Mr. Ruchinan,
expressed an opinion to Mr. Hawkins, that Mr
Hamilton, at a certain time, had given 18s. for
dock, when it was offered him (or 17s. And
that Mr. Hawkins, believing that Mr. Buchanan
might have been miftaken,confulted Mr. Adams,
one of the cotnmjflioners. Mr. Adams did not
believe that any such purchase ever {lad been
' made. By a plain man like myfelf, who docs
not look for blois nor wi(h to find them, this
' whole dory would be set down as a piece of un
impoitant talkâtlte baseless fabric of a vision ;
but to a politician, or an opposition man, it iÂ«
the fubdantial proof of corruption : not a proof
of folly; for no man is such a fool as to give
18s. for an ariiclc, that iÂ» offered at 17. But he
may be so wicked as to give 18, provided the
party had previously dipulated to make him a
prcfent of hÂ»lf the difference. In this cafe, there
would be corruption ; and though the Secretary
of the Treasury Is not the buyer of dock, for it
is bought by the Treasurer, and though he never:
fees the filler, and knows ndthing (bout the mp*
who fell in public market at (he coffee-houfe,
we, a>good politicians.and quick-fightcd watcH
roen. are to suppose, that every unfavourable al
> legation is true, and that'coiruption, whether
po'fliblc or impoflible, is the spring of all mea
sures that we do not approve.
For myfelf, I have condantly supposed, that
ir. a free i.egiflature, there will be opposition to
the Executiveâl believe that opposition is ufe
ful and necessaryâbut I fincerelv wish, that our
watchmcn woLld not cry wolf! wolf! until

induce them to follow our example, and there
by to extend republican liberty over the world.
Yet our scribblers make it appear tiiat liberty
is one thing and government another. To
support government and to recommend a re

been of celebrations of this nature at home,
they consider them as rather bordering on the
absurd in this count y ; this is not the only
specimen by thousands which might be pro
duced, of an rtifult offered to the whole body
of the free citizens of the United States,, by
those who zvi/k to legVflate for the peopleâbut
it appears rather outre to make use of a fo
reigner as the organ of abuse.
The fpirtt of innovation which hat'rdoue
such great things in some part's' of Etfrope,
ha l ; been imported into the United States;
whether it is necefTary in the pnefent circum
stances of our country, time will unfold ; it
is however to- be observed, that the impor
ters are chiefly exotic adventurers, many of
whom it may be justly supposed are as inimi
cal to the fubjiavtiah of office as they are to
the titles by which they are defigna tedâthis
remark may be part'cularly applied to the
proposition for annihilating the Title of Efipire
âwhich Purely is not more odious in the view
of some innovators than the office of Justice of
the Peace. If the people of the United State :
will submit to it, they may have a number of
politicians and legislators who would fooir*
put a new face on their affairs.
It is plain the people are federal, be can's
of late the enemies of government are obli
ligcd to pvetend federalism in order the more
securely to carry on their schemes. Yet they
have not spared the government or its offi
cers. * These federalists, as they call theni
felves, speak of the constitution as a thing
full of dangerous principles, and the r e too
let Joofe without checks or guards. This bad
fyitem they tell us is in the hands of Specula
tors and knavesâof men who are at work
night and day to bring about a monarchy.
Yet they are federal idsâas Anthony lays in
Shakespeare's play of Julius Caesarâthey are
honorable menâthey would not ftrr up mens*
minds to mutiny and civil warâbut they
tear open every wound of the public mind, and
put a tongue in it. Yet they are federalâall
honorable menâWe have their own word for
it.
