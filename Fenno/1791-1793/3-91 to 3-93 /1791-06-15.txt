\LTHOUGH our voice can acid little to the
general acclamation which attends you,
nid to your Excellency must be of finall moment,
/et a mid It the warm congratulations on the ap
pearance in this state of their beloved Chief Ma
gistrate, our silence would indicate a want of re
fpeft ; a silence which would be the more repre
hensible in a community so largely interested in
trade and navigation, more peculiarly under the
directing hand of that government in which
you prelide.
Could any incident encreafe the veneration
we feel for your illuitrious charadter, heretofore
so fully ellablilhed as the soldier, the Itatefman
and the patriot, it is your present expedition, in
undertaking at an advanced period of life, a
long and laborious journey for the purpose of
advising yourfelf, by personal observations and
enquiry, of the true interests of the several Jlatcs
which compose our confederation. From this
tour we pref'age the happy consequence, that
those who are not yet iatisfied with the renden
cy, operation and effects of the present constitu
tion of the union, will be convinced of its superior
excellency to ail former systems of government.
Throughout your journey we wifli you as
much fatisfadtion as can attend it, and if in its
progress we are to be honoured by your visitati
on, the citizens of Fayetteville will be happy in
every attention which may contribute to your
pleasure and convenience.
Under the impression of the importance of a
life so valuable to our country we commit it to
God, with our moll fervent prayer, that it may
long be preserved as full of liappinefs as it hatli
been already full of glory. '

Gentlemen,
IT is due to your goodness and to my own feel
ings, that 1 fliould express ihe sensibility ex
cited by your address, and that I should acknow
ledge the grateful pleasure with which I receive it.
My best services are more than compensated by
the affectionate partiality of my fellow citizens,
and my most anxious willies are gratified ill ob
fervingtht happinef, which pervadesour country.
The very favourable change already nianifeft
ed in our political fyftein, juftifies the prediction
that the future operations of the general govern
ment will be alike conducive to individual pros
perity and national honor.
Should it consist with the necefl'ary arrange
ments of my journey, 1 fball be happy in a per
sonal opportunity in confeliing my obligations
to the regard of the citizens of Fayerteville. In
any event 1 entreat them to be persuaded of my
lincere willies for their welfare.
The Apdr ess oj /he Inhabitants of the Town oj

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Sir,

gratitude and esteem, so jufllv due toyour
exalted flation, your eminent public services, and
the extraordinary virtues that adorn your cha

[Whole No. 222.]
We thank you for the high honor conferred
on us by your vilit to this place in your tour
through the fotuhern Hates, and you with
the most cordial welcome to the chief feaporc
town of the extenhve Itate of North-Carolina.
It may be proper to oblerve, Sir, that if the
progrefsof agricultural and commercial improve
ment, in the llate of which we are a part, bore
any proportion to the great natural resources it
contains, this town would probably have fur
inounted some of the obvious disadvantages of
its situation, and become more worthy ot the
honor it now enjoys by your presence.
Truly sensible that a system of government, at
once benignant and efficient, is the Aire source
of fafety and prosperity to every country where
it obtains, we anticipate, with great pleasure,
the effectual operation of the new coniftitutiofi,
persuading ourselves that the fame wisdom, libe
rality, and genuine patriotism, of which there iÂ«
so illiiUrions an example in the conduct of our
Chief Magiltrate, ai;d have hitherto influenced,
will continue to temper the councils of the na
tion ; we aidently hope that admirable political
fabric, reared upon the basis of public virtue, may
prove a strong pillar of support to the union of
the datesâimproved and ftrengthed by revolv
ing years, may it be as durable asyour fame, and
extend the blessings of civil liberty to the latest
ages.
Accept, Sir, our humble testimony, in addition
to the innumerable instances you have experi
enced, in proof that the fame sentiment pervades
the bieafts of the citizens of the United Stales
universally, that to you, principally (under Pro
vidence) our common country is indebted for li
berty and independence, that those invaluable
acquisitions are become the means of permanent
happiness, is equally an occasion of gratitude to
you.
May you long continue on earth your coun
try's glory and human nature's great ornament,
and finally, in an immortal lhite receive from the
Great Protector of the Universe, the rich reward
that awaits the diltinguifhed benefaiSors of man
kind.
THE PRESIDENT'S ANSWER
To the Inhabitants of the town ofW ilmincton.
G F. N T I. F. M E N ,
Appreciating with due value the fenrj
ments you are pleased to express for my Ra
tion and charaJler, 1 lhould fail in candor and
refpetl: not to avow the grateful sensations excit
ed by your address, for which I thank you with
unfeigned sincerity.
Reasoning from the rapid progress of improve
ment throughout the United States, and advert
ing to the facility which every undertakinginuft
derive from a fettled system of government, the
obviation of those disadvantages, inipofed byfitu
ation on your town, may, 1 think, be calculated
upon within no very distant period.
The fanclion which experience has already
given to the salutary influence of the genera] go
vernment on the affairs of the United States, au
thorises a well-founded expectation that every
aid which a wife and virtuous legislation can ren
der to individual industry, will be afforded, and
creates a pleasing hope, that the happinefsof her
citizens will be commensurate with the growing
dignity and importance of our country.
1 express a heartfelt sentiment in wishing to
your town and its inhabitants a full proportion
of general and particular felicity.

LORD of the fcythril car 1 whose chics dcligh*,
'Tis to ra'fe the foul to fight ;
Come mighty God ! and fill my ftratn
With thy lury-fLfhing heat ;
Which like a roaring torrent founds,
As o*er the horrid rock :r bnurd* t
Or like the ocan's thundering h^a',
When by the howling on high s
Its waves arc lifted to the Â£ky.
'Tis by thy aid alone,
The tribe who pant to swell the fi^hr,
And fee the cannon's slashing light;
While awful thunders fill the air,
Can view the tumult void of fea r .
And feel the scene their fouls delight.â
O ! now mv views thy tra'n,
In dreadful splendor pass the plain !
Thv fifier anger marches firft,
With light'ning darting from her eyes ;
Jler-heart doth beat,
With furious heat,
As though each moment it would burfl ;
While with UD-lifted arm ftie threats th.cfk.ies,
And curling oft her birth,
Doth (lamp with mad'ningfury 'cMinft the earth.
Next comes Revenge an awful form '
Who kindles all the rage of storm ;
His eyes a beamy horrordart,
That (hakes with fear the tim'rous heart ;
His breast a steeled plate enfolds,
A brazen helmet guards his head,
While in his hand a spear he holds,
And all a dazling terror (bed.
Next Jealousy the god of fplcen,
Of doubting heart, but piercing mein,
With trembling step, comes slowly ou,
And casts his fearful eyes around ;
To heaven now. and now to earth,
And now he laughs with inward joy,
But terror soon displaces mirth,
And like a bafhful maiden coy,
He starts at ev'ry found,
And pauses now, and now in hafle he flies along the ground,
Then marchrs on a martial band,
With arms and music in their hand :
Now boldly founds the shrilly fife,
And wakes the sleeping foul to life ;
The doubling drum improves the found,
While from the hills the notes rebound :
Hark 1 the sonorous trumpet blows,
But louder plays the sweetly winding horn,
While ev'ry breast with valour glows,
And ev'ry foul with rage is borne
On rapid wings, to join in war,
The infuiting foe, whose ftillv founds are faintly heard from far.
I.aft in the train comes Liberty,
A GOD- LIKE BEI NG of the fkv.
Bright ft reams of light around his head,
Dazling silver-glory spread :
is golden-hair amidst the blaze,
In curling lines of beauty plays ;
His snowy robe of fpotlcfs hue,
Wafti'd in heaven's etherial dew,
Wide floats upon the buoyant gale,
While all around his presence hail !
His left hand holds a founding harp,
While with his right he fweepsthe silver wires,
And piercing music, fierce and sharp,
Inflames each breast with his own firesâ
The armed band with quickcn'd pace,
In equal measures beat the ground ;
And brighter beams in ev'ry face,
The "heavenly glow at ev'ry found.
But now he sweeps with bolder hand,
The golden chords of deeper tone,
And soul-subduing music floats,
That melts to tearsthe warrior band,
Who mute and liftcning fland ;
Quite ravifh'd with the thrilling notes,
They gaze and gaze on him alone.â
Now all awake the liftcning fojul,
He ceas'd awhile the tuneful found ;
And brightest tears of rapture roll,
While thus he hail'd the troop around
<: Ye glorious band ! together wove,
By mutual intercft and by love ;
Be forever dill the fame.
Still be rous'd by virtue's flame,
When'er thehagged servile train,
Shall dare your liberty restrain.
Thou Anger (hew thy awful eye,
Whence consuming light'nings dart;
And thou Revenge of thundering air,
Lift on high, thv beamy spear,
i hat fhnkes with fear the coward's hearr.
And JealonJy thou changeful god !
Who affeft'fts the doubting nod,
Still extend thy piercing fight,
And drag enslaving schemes to light :
For by your aid combin'd alone,
Shall I prefcrvc my (ky-built throne.
And last ye glorious martial band!
Who firmly tread this favor'd land,
Whene'er I strike my founding harp,
And rouse the accents fierce and sharp;
J ed by the aidor of your Gods,
frrafp in rage your gleaming arms,
And pour from gaping wounds, the purple floods
Of thofc who madly dare to rouse your dread alarms."
Again he fweepsthe golden firings,
-Loud echo with the music rings;
The lofty mountains all around,
With thundering (bouts of praise resound.
Now higher, bolder swells the note,
And now the modulating found,
Upon the trembling wind doth float,
Then murmuring dies away along the ground
The band inspired, now again,
In quicken'd meafurc beat the plain;
Now in a glorious blaze of light,
They vanish from my fancy's fight,

setting aside the will, tinder a suspicion of the

voted that Colonel Strangsways inuft have been
out of his senses, when he left behind him a le
gacy of thirty thousand pounds for a fimilarpnr

fix thousand pounds a year, and sixty thousand
pounds in money, to the poor, the hungry, and

effects to the King ; appointing the Parliament
of Great Britain his executors ; and directed that

the Bench of Bilhops. Trustees were immedi

By an arrival from France, the editor has re
ceived French Gazettes, published at Paris, /(s
late as April 12. The firft article of importance
they contain, is an account of the sudden death
of M. (late Count) Mirabeauâwhofe talents as
a ftatelman and a scholarâwhose zeal in the
cause of libertyâhave made his loss very sensi
bly felt throughout all France. He died the
2d of Aprilâan eulogium on him was spoken in
iha National Aflembly.
The National Aflembly proceed with {leadinefs
and harmony in the great work of reorganizing
the nationâThe great objects of the Conflit uti
on have been effectedâSome fnbordinate regula
tions were before the Aflembly at the dare of
our papers ; and they appeared to contemplate
with pleasure the speedy arrival of the period
which fiiall close their labours, and give to the
French nation a legitimate legislature.
We fee nothing in the papers of those riots,
plots and (Iratagems which have so frequently
been detailed in the London papers. Almoftall
the Clergy have taken the oath of allegiance, as
have the Ainballadors, &c. to foreign courts.â
Three of the latter have refufed, and their Na
tions have been filled by other persons.
The Right Rev. Bifliop Carrol,of the Roman
Catholick Church, arrived in town a few days
sinceâand has confirmed the bapiifms of a num
ber of Catholicks. This gentleman, justly es
teemed for his piety, learning and benevolence,
Will preach to-morrow at the Roman Catholick
Church.
If, as Mr. Burke laments, " the age of chival
ry is gone the circumitance of beholding eve
ry denomination in the full exercise of their re
ligious privileges, proves that we have in ex
change, an age of Toleration, Liberty and Light.
Yesterday arrived here a Brig from St. Ma
loes, in France, under the French National Flag,

in error. She brought some dispatches for the
Consul.

It appears by the proceedings of the conven-
tion of the Protestant Episcopal Church at New
ark, New-Jersey, on the 4th inrtant, that a Copy
Right in the Book of Common Prayer, as altered
by the late general Episcopal Convention, had
'oeen claimed by William Hall, as proprietor
under the art of Congvefs. The convention have
remonstrated against this claim, and declare it is
not well foundedâthat such afl'umed exclusive
privilege is in its operation an imposition 011 the
members of that church: and they accordingly
prcpofe, that the several llate conventions of the
Episcopal Clergy should take rneafures to have
the said book printed reasonably, and expediti
otilly, that a general ftippJ-y of them may be ob
tained.
In a hail floral in Montgomery county, Penn
sylvania, the 24th ulr. very great injury was fof
tainedâthe crops of grain, and in short every
green thing within its reach were destroyedâ
cattle, sheep, hogs and poultry were killed hy the
hail flo nes, some of which were found to weigh
three ouncesâmany persons es>pofed were very
much wounded ; and it was ohferved that the hor
ses had large fwel lings on their heads and bodies,
occasioned by strokes from the hail.
A writer in Mr. Dunlap's paper, noticing the'
account of the Caterpillars in Elizabeth-Town,
Maryland, faysâ" That the finellof gunpowder
will entirely destroy these infects. Make a rnn
of powder near or round the spot, or place at
some diltance fniall heaps of powder, wlien the
dew lays upon the plant, burn it and the fmoak
will kill them. If they should be in cabbage or
other vegetables, fire a gun between the rows ;
it will have the fame effect. This method is fuc
cefsfully pracftifed in Holland, and has always,
answered the purpose."
By the latest European arrival, the reasons of
the Empress of Ruflia for declining the mediato
rial offices of the allied powers are received in a
memorial sent by the Danish Ambafl'ador to the
Courts of London, Berlin, and the Hague.
After faying that Denmark had fulfilled its en
gagements in attempting to bring about a peace,
the memorial states the reasons afligned by the
Empress, the substance of which is, " That her
Imperial Majetty will neither dispute upon terms
nor abltratt ideas, but (he appeals to the hearts
of those Sovereigns of whole friendiliip she isde
firons, whether there can exilt a more equitable
jlatu quo than that which she proposes, of restor
ing a number of entire provinces, only to retain
one single place, and an uncultivated dirtrict, for
the sole purpose of procuring to herfelf a more
secure frontier ; and if ever a power, constantly
victorious, had given such strong and decided
proofs of perfect moderation. She has yet very
important considerations to infill on : she wiflies
not to be confounded with those ambitious Sove-
reigns, whole threatning progress ought to be
flopped: she is desirous of retaining but one part,
which is only tifeful to her, as tending to her fe
cntity, and which is but an imperceptible point,
when compared with her Empire or that of the
Turks : she does not threaten the Turks with de-
Itruftion : she restores to them almost every thing
fhe restores to them what they are neither able
to defend, nor to preserve."
55
Her Imperial Majesty lastly fays, " That she
is persuaded that fhefhall find those Courts whom
she considers as her friends, as much disposed to
moderation as (he is herfelf. That it is the only
rivalfhip to which her heart will open ; it will
be inaccessible to that of force and power."
By the latest British accounts it appears thar.
the profpetfl of war with'Ruffia was almolt at an
end. Mr. Pitt and the King of Prussia it is laid
are willing to accede to the propositions of the
Eniprefs, communicated by the Daniih Anibaf
fador.
Recent accounts from the French Weft; Indies
info rm, that peace and tranquility are return
ing, and the profped: of a good crop is very flat
tering.
By a late London paper we learn, that the
Whig Club of England has exprefled its disappro
bation of a war with Russia, in the molt pointed
terms, as a bodv.
Accounts from France, several days subsequent
to the death of M. Mirabeau, inform, that the Na"
tional Aflenibly were drawing near to a cf&fe of
their labours in compleating theconftitution.â
The aftonifliing abilities of M. Mirabeau had been
exerted to great effed:. The Eriglifh paragraph
ifts represent him as the main prop of the revo
lution ; but it may justly be queried, whether
an extensive confidence was placed in him either
by the aflenibly or the nation, when it was well
known, and the event has shewn it, that if the
existence and establishment of the revolution had
depended on his abilities, they would have been
risked on the consequences of a debauch.
A terrible fever was raging in the county of
Wexford, Ireland, the beginning of April lastâ
and from some circumstances attending the rife
and progress of the disorder, it was greatly fear
ed to be the plague. Four and five persons were
laying dead at one time in a house. The next
arrival from that kingdom, will probably bring
further particulars.
By the latest arrivals from Europe, it appears
that the foreign markets for wheat and flour are
extremely dull, and will very probably continue
so. An extra duty is laid on the exportation of
foreign flour from Spain to their Weft-India
islandsâand there is a corn-bill before the British
House of Commons, which has an unfavorable
afped\ This bill has been carried in committee,
by which the average price of wheat for regu
lating the importation, is to be 525. per quarter,
instead of 48s. as usualâand what is worse, any
wheat arriving in any port of Great-Britain when
the ports are shut, is not to be landed at all.

that its beautiful situation is not surpassed, if equalled by any ; be

TO THK PUBLIC.
ON T the fourteenth of January last the subscriber presented a
memorial to Congress, bating his intention to publish a
complete and correct octavo edition of the Laws, Resolutions, and
Treaties of the United States, and praying that such measures
might be adopted as would give authenticity to fa id edition.
The memorial was read in tile House of Representatives, and re
ferred to the Secretary of State. On the seventh of February that
officer, after mapuredcliberation made the following report : â
" The Secreiary of State, to whom was referred the memorial
of Andrew Brown, printer, of Philadelphia, has had the fame un
der his confidcration, and thereupon makes the following
Retort,
The Memorialist states that he has in contemplation to publilh
a corredl edition of the Laws, Treaties, and Resolutions of the
United States, and prays, that such mealures may be adopted for
giving a public authentication to his woik, as may ensure its re
ception throughout the United Stales.
The Secretary of State observes, that there exists, at present, but
a single edition of the laws of the United States, to wit, the one
printed by Childs and Swaine; that this edition is authentic, the
proof-lhee'ts thereof having been carefully collated by fwovn
clerks, with the original rolls in his office, and rendered literally
conformable therewith. That the firft volume of this edition ran
now rarely be found, the copies originally printed being mofHy
disposed of.
That it is desirable that copies of the laws fhou'.d be so multi
plied throughout the states, and in such cheap forms, as that every
oiti/en of the United States may be able to procure them. That
it is important also, that such publications be rendered authentic,
by a collation of the proof-fhrets with the original rolls, by sworn
clerks, when they are printed at the feat of government, or in its
neighbourhood, and by a collation of the whole work when print
ed a* a distance, and a certified correction of its typogrophical er
rors annexed to each volume.
septs)
That this, however, if done at the public expense, would occa
sion an inconvenient augmentation of the number of clerks, as the
ast of collation requires the presence of three clerks, one'to hold
theVoll, a second a printed copy [already authenticated, and the
third the proof sheet.
That it would be more reasonable that persons of confidence
fliould be employed, at the expence of the Editor, to be named
and sworn as clerks, for the special occasion.
That, in this way. he is 01 opinion that it will be advantageous
to the public 10 permitthat the Laws, to be printed by the Memo
rialist, be collated with, and corre&ed by, the original rolls, and
that a certificate thereof, by the Secretary of State, be annexed to
the Edition.
THOMAS JEFFERSON, Secretary of State.
February 5, 1789."
In confcquencc of this report, Congress have adopted the fol
lowing resolveâ
" RESOLVED by the Senate and House of Represent a-
TiVESofthe United States of America in Congress alfembled,
That Andrew Brown, or any other printer, be permuted, under
the direÂ£Hon of the Secretary of State, to collate with, and corrett
by, the original rolls, the Law., Resolutions and Treaties of the
United States, to be by him punted. And that a certificate of
their having been so collated and corrcfted be annexed to the said
Edition. Provided, That such collation and correction be at the
expense of the said Andrew Brown, or such other printer, and
that the person or persons to be by him or them employed in that
service, be approved by the Secretary of State.
