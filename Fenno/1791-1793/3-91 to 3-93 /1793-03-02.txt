JCaNGRESS.
BOUSE OF RFPRt.SrNTATIVFS.
SATURDAY, February 16.
IV committee of the whole on the bill to ef
tablifii fees to be paid on the transfer of pub
lic securities.
Mr. Steele in the chair.
The bill v.'as read by the chairman âan a
mendment was propofcd, which was, to strike
out the last line of the bill, and to fubllitute a
clause providing for the disposal of the fees,
which are to be received by the Comptroller of
the Treasury and the Loan-Offices.
Mr. said he did not know whether
he should vote for the bill or not; at. prefsnt he
had his doubts on the expediency of departing
from a principle eftablifhtd in the government,
which is, that public officers fliould becompen
fated for their lervices without being authorised
to receive any feeS. This principle has been
adhered to in all cases whete it was praflicable;
and i' mill appear the nioft eligible mode when
it is corfidered how difficult it is to guard a
gainst abnfes and frauds: he considered 4t would
TO if not impoflible, :o pri>-
vide adtqua e checks nrthe^brctirfefa.
Mr. Benfon objefled to the provitlon gene
rally, he confidercd it as laying a tax on a par
ticular species of property already encumbered
with variouÂ«reftridtionsinrefpe>ft to which there
is no option left to one of the parties. The go
v rnm nt has prefcribcd for its own security a
particular process i.i the business of transferring
pr.blit certificate*. He saw 110 reason in impof
inga tax in addition to thete regulations.
\>r avton, in replying to Mr. Fitzfimons
ob (' ved I." the process of the business inmak
ifig the t - 'rs atthefeveral Loan Offices would
afford â  ' tunity to provide compleat and
adij.m;; any ahufe in the business
or em'ic**': it 0f the fees; the names of the

fr..; m â¢ he c ""-
ceive> spp. y with any greater forcc
flfan what might be urged again <1 fees imposed
on deeds, &c. Mr. Davton conceived that as a
hod of clerks were employed in the Treasury
Dirpartmant on thfs hufinefs of tiSnafer which
was done for the benefit of individuals,'be tho't j
it no more than reasonable that they Ihould pay
the expence.
Mr. Clark followed Mr. Dayton in a train of
similar observations; he laid he saw no difficul
ty in, the business, the expence wiil fall on the
speculators only.
Mr. Sturgesfaid, it appeared to him that the
bill would operate as an infraction of the law
shaking provision for the public debt; he con
ceived that that law does not contemplate any
charge being paid by the proprietors of public
securities for transferring the certificates . they
never supposed that they would be clogged with
any such charge. In this view of the fubjed he
Ihould be oppofedto the bill.
Mr. Benfon replied to Mr. Dayton's remarks
on the tax imposed on deeds; he said the cases
are rotparellel. In th* present cafe there is ho
option to the public creditors; the government
has already prescribed how this bufiliefs shall be
don*; it must therefore be considered as a breach
of the rights of the creditors. With refpedt to
the expence* falling exciufively on speculators,
he said the gentleman was mi (taken, and men
tioned an infbance,to fliew that perfom who are
not speculators will be fubjedl to the tax. Mr.
TSenfon doubted the propriety however, of a re
gulation which ihould operate so partially He
very much doubted the legality of framing a tax
that Ihould be pointed at any class of citizens in
particular.
Mr. Mercer, after a few mtrodu&ory remarks
on the general utility of public institutions, and
the obligation which every citizen is under to
support them, remarked, that however true this
principle is, yet it is but just that those who de
rive peculiar personal advantagesfrom these in
stitutions, Ihould pay foi those advantage*. He
applied this reasoning to the cafe in hand, and
obferved,that on this principle he thought the
provision contemplated by the bill was reafona
bls and just. With refpeii to taxing the proper
ty in the funds, he remarked, that the fubjeCfc in
volved the moll extensive conliderations. He
ihould not at present enter into a difcuflion of
them; but,he observed, that it wa9 clearly his
opinion, that that specie* of property was liable
to taxation in common with every other; and
this idea he said was famflioned by the usages
tuftoms of nations.
Mr. Barnwell said it appeared to him that
the particular regulation eftablilhed in the Trea
sury department were made for the public ad
vantage : if so, he could not fee the justice of
throwing the expence on individuals. If the bill
fliould be fuilained,he contended that the indi
viduals should have the alternative of transferr
ing or not, as is the cafe in refpeft to deeds. He
ihould therefore be opposed to the bill unless
fbme provision for an alternative Ihould accom
pany it.
Mr. Ottrj ohje&ed to the bill on general
principle*; he iUted (undry confcqiwnces cx

tremely injurious to the publte credit, which
might be grafted on the principle contained in
the regulation proofed.
Mr. Boudinot observed t" at when the propo
rtion was firft brought forward, he entertained
a favourable idea of the provision ; he had not,
however, till this morning, critically examined
the operation of the principle in relation to the
contra& between the Government and the pub- j
lie creditors : He was indebted, he said, to the
gentleman from New-York for the idea of an
interference. Mr. B. then analyzed the provi
sion refpedhng the public debt, in order to fhewj
that the regulations adopted were considered as
final and conclusive; full *nd compleat provifipn
was made to defray the expence by the govern
ment ; from hence he deduced this consequence
that the tax contemplated would have a retro
fpe&ive afpc&, would interfere with the flipula
tions of the contract, and go to injuring the
public credit effentiaUy; for, said he, if Con
gress can lay a tax on the transfer of the public
securities, they may extend the principle to such
a degree as to interdict all transfers whatever,
yea to taxing the debtâan idea he conceived
totally fubvedive of public credit.
remarWd, tlfe reasoning of
his coileaguc, and of the gentleman from Maffa
chulet'rs (Mr. Gerry) went too far,it would ap
ply to every fptcies of imposition whatever; and
the government would thereby be in effe6l pre
cluded from laying any duties on Impost and ton
nage.
Mr. S. Bourne was in favour of the billâhe
cited precedents from Probate and other Offices
in the several states, to fliew that paying fees
w. s customary, and was submitted to by the
people; the parties deriving the benefit, it is
universally conceived should bear the expence
incurred.
With refpeft to the fee 9 he conceived the pre
cedent is already established by the government,
fees are paid in the department of state : these
fees are accounted for toÂ» the Secretary of the
Treasuryâhe thought a similar mode might he
adopted in the present cafe ; let the fees be paid
for the benefit of the United States, and let the
several officers account with the head of the
Treasury department for the fame, who will ac-
c ount to the legislature.
t Mr. Clark bill by furthe*-*Â»Â«..
marks; he extended his ideas toTEaxlrijythepub
lic fccu ities; this expedient, he said, the public
exigencies may poflibly require. He repeated
his observations relative to the number of clerks
in the Treasury, employed on the business of
transfers; the great expence hereby incurred he
said was for the advantage of speculators, of
which a host was colle&ed in a neighbouring
city ; where, as from a center they extended,
their negociations to all parts of the Union.
Mr. Lawrance laid he always considered it
as indicative of the badness of a cause, when a
person descends to general invectives against
public bodies; âhe alluded to Mr. Clark's re
flection on the city of New-York. Mr. C. said,
he had not mentioned New-York. Mr. Law
rance said his remark was applicable to the
gentleman's refle<stioin,let him refer to any city
whatever, Mr. Lawrance then entered into a
general consideration of the fubje&, and stated
the various steps of the process prescribed by the
funding law in relation to transfers. The de
du&ions he drew were similar to those made by
Mr. Ben foil.
Mr. Murray was agairft the billâhe tho't
it wrong in principle, and thinking lb, no ar
gument fpejcioufly drawn from a final! gain to
the public whiah it_\vas unworthy in them to
demand, (hoiild tempt him to vote for it.
He declared that when the bill was fir ft no
ticed âhis reflections h'ad preftnted the provt
fion merely in a sort-os analogy with fee? juft
lv demanded in courts, and in common civ : l
oJiices, as oifices for the registering of deed
âBut the moment the course of his reflexi
ons had traced the fub}eÂ£fc in that analogy, he
discovered a strong and insuperable obje&ior.
These inftiturions, for the li.poort of which
fees were derir; ndable from such as had busi
ness, were fucli as the law eftablifned for tie
intercourse between one individual and ano
therâhere, on the contrary, the law relates
to a proceeding in which a debtor pubi c is to
transfer its promiftbry notes to individual cre
ditorsâThe public is a debtorâhas iflucd ne
gotiable paper, part t f the value of which de
pends on t'le i'i ility of negociationâthe ne
cessity ef regifttfjfcig transfers being merely to
fccurc the publ trr-As the debt was -Ã¼bferibed
under t le idea vf trailers being of ex
pence, so to force the pur ties to pay fees would
diminish the value of the piopert}âfor if it
be an cxpecfe now to the public, and that ex
penfe lie intended to be taxed on the thing
transferred, it would amount to something
like diminiihing of the debt without d) (charg
ing it. There is a (olid diiference between
laws that regulate fees to be paid on the trans
actions between man and man, and such as
relate to t ran fa <51 ions like this between a debt
or public and an individual creditor âIf a
debtor const tutes a debt of a negotiable kind,
and at the time ofiffuing bis note makes each
transfer necetiarily to depend on an aiÂ°t of his
own, We cannot expect to be paid for thisâ
313
l'iquality farms a part of the value he has
parted from.
The debate on the fub'efl was continued till
a late hour ; several other gentlemen spoke on
the occpfion.
The motion to amend the bill was at length
agreed to, the committee then rpfe arid reported
accordingly.
The bill and the amendment were laid on the
table.

Letter from Lieutenant-General Miranda.
' " Head Quarters General at
Ruremond, Dec. ft.
" Tbe citadel of Antwerp being taken,and
the navigation ofthe Scheldt opened,l inarch
ed forward on tbe 6th current with the army
under mv command, to attack Austrian Guel
dres, This mmcU.ofaSJtaguesfor the most
pin . .i'er a wild country, was executed with
aftoniiiing order and rapidity. On our ar
rival at the Mettfe, we found several posts of
tlie entmy, which the vanppiard easily requir
ed, Imingtaken some of them prisoners. We
took possession alio without opposition of the
townsof Wefem and Wert, belonging to Aus
trian fiueldres, and of all the territory on
this fide of the Meufe. We then crofTed that
river ;t the town of Wefem, by means of
some boats, as the enemy had destroyed all
their lying bridges. In Ihort, with 3000 in
fantry, and 300 buffars, we attacked our ene
mies, <vho, to the number of 3000 infantry,
and 3so cavalry had retired to Ruremond.
At break of day the head of our army having
appeared before Ruremond, found the bi idge
on tie Roer burnt. Our cavalry finding a
ford,,pafted the river, and the infantry effect
ed a falfage, by procuring pontoons. At nine
in thi morning, our troops entered the Capi
tal olGueldrcs in triumph, amidst the accla
mations of tbe inhabitants, who, in their joy,
invo!Â«d liberty, and blessed the French who
had lipught thr.m that prefcnt.
" 1 then found by the best information,
theenemy to the number of 3Â»5 30 regular
troops, commanded by General Gentreuil,bad
retired precipitately at five in the morning.
The Austrian Council, or government of the
Netherlands, who had taken refuge here, did
the fame four or five days before. My van
guard, which I immediately sent in pursuit of
the enemy, will not fail to come up with them
in their flight. Some of the inhabitants of
Prussian Gueldres, have already presented
themselves before me; to offer me their Cer
vices, and to solicit the fame happiness which
Austrian Gueldres mnft enjoy under the egis
of France.

A letter was Tent to the Prefideht, ftating 1 ,
that the Rovalifts were beginning to shew
themselves ; and, that many writings were
circulated in favor of Louis s XVl.
Thuriotâ" This is certainly true ; but
the best means of bringing hack tranquility,
and fupprclTing faction, will be to Decree,that
whoever {hall propose, or attempt to break
the unity of the Republic, or to detach any
part of it, in order to unite it to a foreign
country, fliall be punished with death.''â
Decreed.

baclf confidence, I fliatl propose another which
will tond fttl) to scco*iipri'ffi that objedt.
The Throne f* orcrtnrrredâtfce tyrant will
foon'he no more, hut despotism exists ;
its ancient habit?, its creatures ftiW exist ;
let us iipitare the Romans, they expelled
Tarquiw and his family;âlike them let us
banish the family of the Bourbons. Louis
XVI. criminal and in chains is now not dan
gerous : we miift however facrifice him to
our fafety, and banish his family. If any Cfc
ception is to he made, it must not be in lavor
of the branch of Orleans. Thole who are the
most beloved a e the most dangerous. The
name of Bourbon is odious to every true Re
publican, and that of Fga/ify is so much the
more lingular as he a!Te<sb to conceal it. His
children have great courage, and they may
form alliances with the daughters of Princes.
I think them dangerous. If Orleans has made
facrifices to Liberty let him add to them, that
of delivering us from his p efence and froni
the lad branches of tie family of the Capets.
Charles I. died on the fcaffold, and yet En

Princes,but monarchy has its superstitious vo

shall cease to be dividedâdrive from you eve
ry thing that may bring back arbitrary pow-

Louvetâlil1 il I support this motior, and in
my opinion, except Antonietta and her son,
refpe&ing the fate of whom the Convention
re'erve to them r elves the right to determine,
every individual of the family ought to quit
France in 24 hours after the trial of Louis,
and to be punished with death if they return."
Laujuinais Remember the manner in* which
Egalire was ele&ed. Remember that the armies
are in the hands of his son are beloved
by the {Â©Idlers, and they defrrve to be To on ac
count of their bravery. K emember also, that an
attempt was made to get a person who was for
merly only Chancellor to F.galite, appointed
Minister at W?r ; any one may comprehend
these hints : Wedeteft Royaltyâlet us therefore
prove it by banifhwg all the relations of the ty
rant.
" MIRANDA."
Chabot.â If you wifli to exercise ostracism,
vf-'U must not confinc it to the family of the
Caocu.
The Convention, after some further re
marks, decreed by acclamation, That
" All the members of the family of the
BOurbonrs, Capets, except those who are de
tained at the Temple, {hall quit the depart
ment of Paris in 24 hours, and in three days
the territories of the Republic and the coun
tiies in which the French armies prelently
are."
The Convention likewise decree, that the
Ministers Pache and Roland should t>e replac
ed, and that the Committee of Constitution
should prefcnt, in as (hort a time as pofTible, a
pian for organizing an Executive Council aj>
pointed by the people.
JCerfaiiit. I request the Convention to lecoJ
!cÂ£t the fatal epoch, when England, which al
ways takes advantage of the faults of the French
Government, caused to he exiled bv its intrigues
in 1757, M. D'Argcnfon and M. Machant, the
only two Ministers whose talents it dreaded, and
bv their means harried us into a difatlrous and
difgraceful war.
Pet ion Rabaud, and frveral other members
here attempted to fprak, but they were not able
to make themfelvcs heard.
Am adjournment was then twice proposed and
negatived, and Barrere proceeded to read the
firft article of a decree for banilhing the whole
family of the Bourbons, except those confined
in the Temple. A violent tumult now ensued ;
and after lons and uproar, during
which the President was twice obliged to putcn
his hat, it was refolvcd Â«fiat the queflion fhouid
be decreed; and that any member who might
interrupt the deliberation, fhouid be condu&ed
to the.Abbaye.
Rewbel hav'ng asked the Convention whe
ther they co\ild, without infringing the fort
reignty of the People, expel a member [Ega
lity] for no other reason than that he belonged
to this or to that family, a mod tumultuous
debate, or lather an uproar took place in tie
[Whole No. 40j.]
-Convention. The Proficient endeavored to
restore eider, and was obliged twice to put
on his hat- This confufion continued lor two
hours, dfjring the whole of which time hardly
a word could be beard.
It was at last propolird to except Egality
from the Decree, and so adjourn the quelti
ob, so far as it related to him, for three days.
This motion was adopted.
Some original Iclteu ot Mr. I.apniie, were
tjaiifmiltfd to the Convention by Madame
Olympii Degouges. who oJfcied at the fame
time to undertake the defenee ol Lmiis XVI.
On this offer the Convention proceeded lothe

that he never favored any party or tadion what

A debate took place refpe&ing the existing
Committees ; Tome Members haying insisted
on the execution ot the law, which ordains,
that one half of* the Members of each ftiall, at

The Convention at length decreed, that
this law should be put in execution, and that

Couthon vemonftrated against the Decree

it infringed the Sovereignty of the People, so

and that it was unworthy of the reprefenta.

CONGRESS are drawing to a closeâthere
are some important matters vet pend

duuc the bulinels, are ful.citous still to do as
much as poffibk ; tliey have to encounter vet

business will then be done better ; but, that
it will be undone. This is not ay uncharitable
luppofition âfor when opposition finds its ar
guments against the principles trt nieaXures
refuted, it constantly brings forward the next

thing for their countryâif those whd bellow
the loudest against the Constitution, and the

certainly <roes out in Marchâhe has
up his houleâfome fay, the Secretary <f the
Trea r ury and the Secretary of War, will re

this may be observed, that it is a most flajtant
and scandalous violation of republican princi

characters, without mercy and without trial,
or without the ftradow ot proof : What millt
be the consequence of such conduct, hut this,
that men of honor and fenlibility will shrink
from, and avoid public trusts âtheir ,peaces
will be filled with thele unprincipled calum

while they peculate in the public interest.
The President of the United States has
come in for a due fliare of the dirt thrown
from the mud-carts of these traducers ot all
good men : But his patriotifin is proof agUinft
every aiTaulc, and the confidence and venera
tion of the friends of virtue will support him
to the end of his days, in being the protestor
and preset ver of our free and glorious Consti

The majority of the Convention speak de

As Louis proceeded to the Convention, and
as he returned, though the crowd which col

of indignation was heardâwhether to ac
commodate each other's fight, or out of some

known, but the greater part of the 'populace
appeared uncovered as the procefTion pafled ;
the carriage was guarded by a picked body of
630 men. Louis appeared altogether in dilh

rough.

Drar Sir,
" On Friday evening last. died, Mr. Rumfcv,
.of Maryland. On the evening before, while
fitting with some members offthe Society for en
couraging Britifli arts, fcienccs and manufac
tures, (who, from the high opinion they enter
tained of his genius, had frequently cenfulted
liim'at their meetings) he complained of a sud
den pain in his head, and retting it on his hand
on the table, in an instant became apparently
lifelefs Medical aid being immediately had,
a vein was opened, and symptoms of life return
ed : he was put into a waun bed, under the
care of a good nuife, who adminiitered the re
medies which were prescribed by the mod emi
nent of the faculty. But his disorder baffled
their {kill; and though nothing was left unat
tempted, that could be devised to rcftore him,
he expired in a few hours, without struggle, and
without having recovered the free u(e of his
speech or faculties.
" As the feat of his malady was in his head,
after his death it was opened. What 1 had be
fore conjeflured, now became confirmedâthat,
ovetplicd with energies and thinking, lome of
the veflels of the brain wire fairly worn our.
Accordingly, there had happened a rupture of
one of them, which was mantfeftly the immedi
ate cause of his death. This day he is to be de
cently inferred near Wcflminfter Abbey.
" In Mr. Rumfey we have loft a citizen, the
vigor and extent of wbofe intellect has fcldom
been furpafTcri ; and according to many of the
best judges here, very seldom equalled. I have
the honor to be &c."
COMMUNICATIONS.
When those who only write and declaim
against public measures fliall be considered as
the patriots of our country, the bell title to
public confidence will arise from a knafck at
Disorganizing the Government. â¢
It is so very easy to find fault, and there
is so much merit to be derived from filching
that of our neighbor, that it is really surpriz
ing the group of Diforganizei s is not more
numerous than it is.
Parties are not very amiable in any coun
try. Their virulence in England hag long
been lamented by the most virtuous men of
that nation. It is however but justice to their
factions to remark, that they do not attack
their conftitution r nor even whisper the divi
sion of the iiland into two governmentsâOur
American faction is really scrambling for of*
sice and power, but the means they chufe arÂ©
deadly. In these two particulars they dis
tance all rivals. They set out declared ene->
mies of the constitution itfelf, and they attack
the characters of the servants of the public
with a malignity that is unexampled.
