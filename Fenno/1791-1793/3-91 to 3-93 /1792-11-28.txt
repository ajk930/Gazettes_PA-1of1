A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS*:
[No. 52 of Vol. IV.] Wednesday, Nom
fa ths <>AZt ri L of the UNIT&D STA TES,
A PUBLICATION upon the enfuinp elec
tion ol Vice-Prefideiit of the United States,
under the signature of Lucius, has appeared in
the public papers. The writer introduces the
fwbj'tt with loine remarks upon the importance
of the office and the necefltty of filling it with a
pcrlon of competent qualification ; The only
competitors wbofe met its he invtftjga r es and be
tween whom he ittppoks Â«he decifmn rclis, are
John Aaams, Esq. and Governor Clinton ; he
declines a view ot the positive merits of the ref
petlive candidates, and inquires only against
whom there are the feweft exceptions ; ihefe he
reduces to a finglc head, against eachâTo Mr.
Adams, the prelum prion of his at tachment to a
government by King, Lords and Commons :
To Governor Clinton, Ins opposition to the con
fh tut ion of the United States. âThe former he
conceives to be a serious objection and to remain
in its full force ; the latter he concludes is done
away by ihe amendments, and is at any rate the
Icaft weighty ot the two. After magnifying the
enr and dinmiilhingthe other, agieeabje to his
vilhes, he concludes as if his premifej wen ful
iy tttauii:*hr d ,* nÂ«t if ttefc-fjci rd SrJiic s wjlVto
prtferve their government as in its pre ion t form
tle&ve and i iÂ»ed in its powers they cannot
hditate to decide in favor of Governor Clinton.
This I take to be a fair ftatemeni of the publica
tion in question. The mode he has adopted of
ifcertaining the merits of the competitor is fin
giilai ; inttead of contrailing their talents and
characters, he takes a negative view of them and
g : ves Imn the preference against whom lcaft is
clj ct â ri.

To corroborate the objeÂ£fcion against Mr.
Adams he obf rves, 11 that his writings entitled

Frem The AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER.
PRO AND CON.
Argumenti agninjl the Re-eleflwn oj Mr. Adams.
First. HP**? constitution, and the
J- spirit of* the people,are republican.
Mr Adams is for a government of king,
lorcfo, and com.iions.
Second. Since the constitution was adopted,
f.rce his eleffcion and oath to support it, his
writing? have laboriously encleavorcd to dif
guffc his constituents with- republican govern
ment, ard prepare their minds for ?. govern
ment of king, ! ords, and commons.
Third. In his lat?ft writings he bar. declar-
iugeilay towards a well ordered government,
by which the whole scope of his writings, fiuce
he vftit.?d the courts of Europe, Ihew â¢, that
he means a government of king, lords, and
commons.
These objections, more particularly at the
present juncture, when the spirit of monarchy
is every where waging open or secret ar on
the spirit of freedom, must fink deep in the
mind of every true American. That they
are founded in truth is well known to aii who
have read the ieveral publications of Mr.
Adams, on the fubjeft of government. The
quotations from these works, in the excellent
pieces signed Lucius y have denionftrated, from
Mr. Adams's own mouth, that he is a decided
adversary to republican government ; and if
the constitution is to be,deemed the criterion
of federalifm, that he is more of a real ope
rative antifederalift, than any citizen of the
United States, out of the party attached to
the lame monarchical tenets.
Arguments for the Re-t!eÂ£licn of Mr. Adaju.
First. The name of Adams l as been fub
fcrib.d, along with the name of Washington,
to the laws of the unionâa circumstance of
more real weight with an enlightened people,
than any little difference between the repub
lican principles of the one> and the monarchi
cal principles of the other.
Second. If he is hot re defted, it may be
owing partly to votes iu Virginia, who, hav
ing the good fortune to furnifh the citiren
elected by all the states fÂ®r the President,
ought to have no voice in the tlettion of a ci
zen of some other flare for Vrce-PreficJcnt.
Third. Ifheiinot re-ele&ed, it may be
owing partly also to the votes of Nortb-Ca
rolina and South-Carolina. Now it hat been
very clearly, as well as very kindly fhetrn,
by the best friends to the dignity and magna
nimity of thole states, that they ought to vote
against their own republican principles; left
they Ihould be falfely and impudently taxed
with conforming to the opinions of other
states.
Fourth. If he is not re-elected, it will he
tray what every man, who considers the fede
ral conftitutinn as a proraifmg eflav towards
a higher ought most carefully to
(mother ; namely, that the people are in their
hearts attached to fee republican govern
ment, and can'rot be brought, by any art or
management whatever, to give a direct or io
direft countenance to the flavifti principles of
monarchy and aristocracy.
These arguments, in favor of Mr. Adams,
are deduced from several late ftrifture* in the
newspapers, and particularly from a very cu
rious publication signed Marcus. They" will
doubtless have all the influence t!>ey merit, on
the fuffrages which are to decide the compe
tition for the Vice-J?refid(jacy of the United
States. . MUTIWS.

NOT A BENE.
A PUBLIC debt corrupts the people, and
therefore it should not he loifved in a
republic. Tiiis has been proved b\> terrain
newspaper writers, and n dail.r proving in
conversion. Bnt t'lii corr.-pting influence
began on!v when the debt bj -.an to bave cie
dit. Had the new Ongrefs 'r.ve let the debt
alone as the old Conr.rels did, becaule they
bad no funds, in a few years it would lave let
us aloneâwe Ibould have had no trouble, and
be at this moment out of all danger of beinf;
spoiled and corrupted by a public debt. The
virtue and purity of a government that %>uld
thus have purged off this great mass of foul
matter, would never hevenfter prove the
worse for temptation, nor the worse for the
wear. The conduct of feveial of tb? fiates
had furiiifhrd the new Congress an ufeful les
son-âyet the teaching, even of experience,
I lla<i been loft upon that body. While the
I states kept fhis giant vice of a public debt
trie Conquering. Jo ,t of. tit? lav.-, the
certificates did no more harm many
cnips. \yasfuch a thing as fpeculatiort known
it that time? Did any man buy certificates
ill the debt was put in train of being provid
ed for by (_.ongrefs ? Some persons pretend
[scat Congress is not to be ncculed of entiling
peculation, as they fay the temptation to buy
vas greatest when paper was at the cheapcft,
Â»nd in that state the price cf paper was the
frioft fubje<st to fluctuation. Th;s, however,
rannot be trueâfor the cry against specula
tors, it is well known, began with the fund
ing act. No clamor was raised against the
states for leaving the debt unprovided, for,
fuhjeiS: to lie purcbafed up by foreigner*âthe
from the nature 3rd number
pt the certificates, was not remarked, nor the
frequent fiinffling of the laws making the
notes payable for land or taxes. The Secre
tary perceiving there were 61 or 86 foi ts of
paper, proposed to ha*e their, funded and re- j
<luced to three onlyâthe fx. per Cent, three
f>er cent, and deferred stock. Y. r ho cannot
iee iii this a fchernc to puzzle buyers autf fel-
i x ;>en fpecuk.tors crept nut oi intn notes, ce
caufe the darlcnefs favored them, and watched
for prey. The ft ate Jaws, it is to be observed,
were so few, so plain, and so unchangeable,
that the holders of notes, the widows and or
phans, like sheep in a fold, were feenre from
the rapacious wolf. But the funding law has
broke down the fence, confufion hair entered,
the widows and orphans are eat up, the pa
tience of the newspaper pat; lots is gÂ»re, and
the republican virtue of our country is going
as fall as its lame and decrepit condition will
permit.âlHnc if/a hcryvut!âLet the halcyon
days oi'ftate power and slate simplicity come
l again, and come quickly, before our money is
ali gone, and the work of corruption quite ac
compli jhed.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATtVBS.
Tuesday, November 20. *
Debate on the' Resolution offired by Mr. Fitz-
Cmons, on the 19th, refpe&ing a Reduc
tion of the Public Debt See. relumed.
In Committe: tf the Whole.
Mr. Laivrakce in the Chair.
Mr. Baldwin said, when this motion was
laid on the table, he did not feel much oppo
sition to it in his own mind, particularly alter
the explanation given by the mover, that it was
designed merely to obtain information from the
secretary of the treafurv, whether the revenues
of the year would be fufficient to redeem that
part of the public debt, which was by law re
deemable. On attending more particularly to
the expreflions, and from the turn which the
l'ubje& had taken in the difcuflion, he was con
vinced that it was best to strike out the latter
part of the motion, which in general terms di
reiied the " Secretary to report a plan for the
purpose." The etprefiions were too
and indefinite, and on former occasions had been
used to cover much more than was generally
trnderiloodat the time the referenct was made.
If it is only designed on this occasion to obtain
information as to fa<fts in that department,
let the present general words be struck out, and
let the Secretary be directed to report, whether
the revenues of the year are fufficient to redeem
that part ol the debt. If ic is designed that the
secretary Ihould report a new revenue fyfiem,
as he has repeatedly done, lÂ«t that beexpreffed,
that the house at least may understand them
selves. If information on fa<fts or details in the
executive department is the objeit, no one ob
je<fls to it. If legislative opinions, the origina
tion of a law or revenue system is intended, let
it be so expressed. He observed, there was a
kind of political stratagem and finefle sometimes
nfed on such occasions, which experience had
always proved, tended to no good. Individuals,
when they intend to occupy doubtful ground,
in which they are sure they should not be sup
ported by the majority, intrench upon it by de
grees ; at one time a motion is made on one fide
of it, and the luccef* of it depends on their prov
ing, that it is not on the doubtful groundâ
at another time they approach it in the fame
manner on a different fideâand at another, on
a different, till finally the whole is surrounded ;
in fh# f*_ye zi'. iÂ°V*., n â
ai m'jjivnn that extreme, as they had before
done on the other,, it is proved that the whole
ground iÂ« already occupied. In this way the
most absurd and mischievous political doiirines
have been eftabhlhed. He was not without his
apprehensions that, by a few efforts more it
would be found, that iome of the most import
ant parts ef legislation were transferred from the
present legiflaturcs to single law-givers. It had
been the conllant object and ambition of indivi
dual men in all parts and ages of the world ;
there is no doubt but it will be as unrelentingly
pursued here, unkfs controuled by those who
feel themselves injured by it. It might be taken
for granted, that there now were, and always
would be, individuals who had no point in this
progress at which the"" would stop ; that they
would croud towards that extreme as far as
polTible.
He needed no assurance that their number
in that house, or in the country, was very
faiall; but they might make much trouble- He
conceived it would b- of much use on fÂ® great
and pradical points in government, for the"ma
jority whose minds,if thoroughly known to each
other, were probably not much apart, to take
an early occasion to express their definite o
pinion : that the necefl'ary fails and details of
office should be reported from the departments.-
bat that legislative opinions, and the ftrutfure'
ox laws, should be sacred to the two branches of
the legislature.
If one executive officer is ordered to form the
laws which relate to his department, the ofti
cers in the other departments mult do the fame
in theits. Laws wnich relate to war, to the mi
litia, &.C. mud l>e formed by the iecretary at
war; those which relate to the poft-office, poft
roads, and the communications between different
parts of the country, mult be formed by the
poft-nafh r-general; those which relate to the
other fubjefi, whether fweign or domestic,
mull be formed by the secretary of (late. There
is no part. t the federal ground, but what is and
mud be co vered by one or other of the executive
departments; if they are to be called on to origi
nate and form the laws which rela'e to their fe
vera! * "pa'' _, icntÂ», two branch?* j
giflature Â«iii remain a mere council ofreVifion
to approve or rejeS, or pfonofe amendments!
If the majority do not mean to keep on in their
progref* to this extreme, it is time that it (hould
be understood ; he h.mfelf *as anxious to under
stand how far they meant to go, and what (hare
of legislation was to he claimed as their own.
Ke was ftrocgly pe.fuaded that it cventu .
ally come to this, thÂ» under the idea cf obtain
ing hgntan.l information fro,â rhe executive de
partments, laws were not to be made there, or
new legislative system. originated ; but only in
formation offsets and details of office. The two
L?m.7f '. fe 't tUre Â«"Â«ve laws alrtad,
from rach othe-; and â each executive
officer to be con filleted in the fame relation to
the legislature, that the two branches are to each
other ? If they an- not, he begged to know the
diftin&ion. A revenue law could not originate
in the senate ; and yet had not an executive offi
cer repeatedly done that in alegiflative relation
to the houl'-, which even the ienate would nÂ»t
prefome to do ?
He proceeded to ofcferve, in the next plae,
hat this was luch a confufirn. oi all principle n
government, that he was anxious to arreit ts
irogrbfs before it had produced any greater ml
hiefs. Though he had never much venerated
he chara<fler of a mere theorist in governmert,
ret, if there was a finale principle iniportftit
:nough in the whole theory, which might \c
onfidcred as an axiom applicable to all circuji
ilances, it was that of the diitribution of the
po jver.% that the legislative, executive and jud;-
:iary should be kept as far as poOible separate
and diftinit. The reason is mod obvious, to
prevent the concert cf improper pji ons in
Forming and executing the laws. If they who
make the laws, could alio have the ag 'rev in the
Execution of them, no doubt, fyftemi
would be constructed and mightily enlarged,
that their love of power, and grandeur, and pro
perty might have full scope, while they were
carrying them into else&. If they who are to
hÂ»ve the agency in the executiou of the laws,
are admitted also to an agency ia the formation
otthem, they will do the fame thing; all the
agency which they have, will bedire&ed to those
objedts. Not to expeJt it, not to be sure of iti
taking place, is to be a granger to human na
ture. Heobferved, that this part of the argu
ment was in its nature, and had been set in so
strong a light by those who had gone before him,
he should not enlarge upon it.
Mr. Baldwin derived his argument in the lad
place from what had already appeared in prac
tice. Though the age of the government, he
said, did not yet admit of it 6 being rich in this
most valuable of all knowledge ; yet, experience
and praAice had already (Irongly fortified the
principles which he had advanced. He then adi
verted to fever* 1 instances to (hew, that wheJt
the laws had received their shape and form ii
the branches of the legislature, they appeared #a
trial to be in general well accommodated to tie
circum(lances of the different parts of the coun
try : but where they had received their {haft
and form out of the legislature, from the hands tf
an individual, they never after could be well ad
justed to thÂ« circumflances of different parts *
the country ; any alterations that had been at
tempted were but ill appl : ei patch-m>rk.âTri'
a! ha J proved that they were not well shape d.
for they had set very ill on the feelings of the
people
He particularly dwelt on the Import law as an
inftanceof what he intended; that, he laid, w;n
formed entirely in the house in the usual mode
oflrgilhtion, eachmember had an opporttmitr
of confuting it in every stage of its progrefi,
and applying his information in iti proper pis,-,

were employe I, from car to day. in tdl <si

vide against the evils which it would have to
encounter in practice. In this way it wis made
to be aseafy roflibls to every part of iiie coun
try, and yet efficient Very trifling alterations
had been found necessary, except great increases
of the fumt demanded. A vast burden has been
laid on the people, and yet it fits so easy that
there has never been much complaint from any
quarter.
He wiflied the fame could be said with equal
truth of the other part of the revenue system.'and
should never ceal'e to regret that that system had

If, said he, that ill omened petition of some of the
public creditors, taken upjuft at the heel of the
fitft feflion in 1789, instead of being referred to
an executive officer in general terms to report a
plan, in which he tellified for hinfelf, and, he
believed, many others would do the famehe
hid no idea of the extent to which it has gone ;
the subject had been gone into by the houseâthe
system had been formed, and the legislative pro-
Vi.ioi.i. ,r g.id by t;, o fe to whom only it
longed; he believed the finances of this country
would not, at this time have been so intricate a
scienceâthe public credit would have been as
well supported, the debt would have been in a
more simple form; so fu'itle an address to the in
ercfls of individuals, and Â«f particular states -
would not have been contrived; âthe llates
wÂ»uld probably have been allowed, as they had
been always before taught to exped, to finifh
the execution of their fyflems for the payment of
their own debts, and our fellow-citizens not now
have been hunted by the hasfh and troublesome
regulations of an excise system to pay them. If
all this had still been found necessary, and had
originated in public in the legislature, it would
have been accompanied, in every stage of its pro
gress by the information of the citizens, and op
portunity would not have been given for that
legerdemain by which so many of the honest and
industrious who chance not to live within the

His constituents were very remote âtheir inter

Mr. White observed, that the olijeQ of the

good one; but he saw no other way ofefFe&ing

to the head of that department, by that
â¢law, that, without fny forced conftrn&iQn, tlic
fobftance of tfre proportion, now contended for,
may be fuppo&ed by that law:âhe hoped, how
ever, that the main obje.3 of the resolution, ma
king proviGon for the redudioa <rf the public
debt, Would not meet with any embarrassment.
He faggefted amodification of the clause refpe6t-
Ag the secretary's reporting a plan, by adding a
reftricSing clause, that the plan reported should
hare refpeonly to the entitling fundi of thego-
Ternment, without any referrence to additional
taxes for the objeA; to chcck, therefore, that
torrent of abuse, which, in writings and speech
es, were thrown out agaiotl the gorerament on
this very fubjeft:âhe hoped there wonld be no
delay in thisbufinefs; but that the present Con
gress would, in season, pass a law, making ef
fectual provision for dimilii&ing the public debt:
such a law, opce pafled, he was fully of opinion
won'd be so eonfonant to the wifee* of the
people, that no future legislature wanld ever do
any thing to check the progress of this ialutary
work.
Mr. Gile> entered into a eoÂ»<HÂ»rji!t2 ?f s he
nw tne rreattffy*(Ttparimeht. TTc
controverted the opinion advanced by Mr.
White, and infilled, in substance, that the pow
er of the secretary of the treasury was mtrely
concurrent, in reiptift to repÂ«rting plant, with
that of the house.
Mr. White rose to explain; he said he never
had any idea that the house had diverted itfclf of
the right of originating plant: he never conceiv
ed that the secretary of the treasury had t right
to propose any plans or systems to the legisla
ture, urlefs he was called upon to do it.
Mr. Murray, in a few remarks, delivered C
milarfentiments.
Mr. Gerry recurred to the law: he said it was
evidently made the duty of the secretary of the
treasury to prepare plans for the promoting of
the revenue; and that when the house called on
him for his plans, or informatioa, if he was not
then prepared, it would be indicative of want
of capacity, or remifsnefi in duty : but, he Â«b
---ferved, it by no means followed from this, that
the conflruition of the law, given by the gentle
man from Virginia, is ju!t: the house hat not
delegated one particle of its legillatlve power;
it reserves to itfelf, the full right to call for plans
and information; or to refrain from calling for ei
ther, and when the information is received, it is
entirely at the disposal of the house.
Mr. Merctr and Mr. Page added some re
marks in oppolition to the reference, and then
the quell ion for linking outfacing taken, pafled
in the negative.

Cretan of the Treasury, oa tit Redufi'un
of the Public Debt.
Mr. Speaker,
I A M one of tliofe members dcfcribed
by the gentleman from New-York,
who seriously wish to pay the public debt
as fact as possible, and receive thenecef
fary information even from the secretary
of the treasury ; but I make a material
diftin&ion between seeking for informati
on, and transferring the power of origi
nating fyftcms.
To give information of the (late of ll)e
Urion, to recommend fucV bu/itc.. <m
the Pi efident may judge expedent; and
to exercise a limit ted negative on the !iv>
ia certainly all the part urhich the con
stitution authorifei the executive to act
in legislation.
The exilt nee of heads of department?,
is authorised in the constitution, and hath
been ercftcd by the ad of the legifliture 5
these departments ate the inftruinenti of \
collecting information, and repolitariesof I
it, as ic respects the execution and effect
of the laws ; and this information we have
a right to command. This, with the
more genetal and important information,
which the members of this House poflels,
are all that is neceflary to enable us to
give the firft form and complexion to our
revenue plans. To prevent the necefntf
of referring the business to an executive
officer, we will avail ourselves of the in
formation depolited in the Sectttanei
offices. ,
This we have unanimously affertfJ.
and yet tlie gentlemen on the othe: li e
of this qneftion, conllantly aigue in a "
vor of receiving information, as 1 v |-
were against it.âWe wifli for it as mucn,
and for more important purpofesthani. rv.
The gentleman that tlierijj t
of the Secretary's originating pbm ts im
plicated irt the constitution, and eai.s-?
on us to proÂ»e the contrary ;no uc ;

It isconfeffed that it docs not appear'out, ?

JhÂ« nature of the government, as it
proiibits the other branch from intermed
in the Gift formation of money bills,
ard expreTsly dffcribes how far the exe
cutive power may interfere with the le
#idative, is fufficiently exprelGve of the
folign of the constitution. Legiflativc
authority is in its own nature incommu
;nicable, and cannot be transferred ; a
member of the legislature cannot appoint
a deputy toferve in his place ; if any pow
tr is evclufively veiled, it is that of giving
> the firft complexion to reveitue fy Items ;
r thss is the fpeciiil trust of that branch
which poffefles within itfelf the greatell
knowledge of the people's circnmllances,
and participation of their interefla j and
this influential power is thus guarded for
obvious reafotis. 13ut the conllitutional
principles involved in this question have
been explained with so mush ability by
fcveral ot'<er gentlerotn who have been up
before me,that it is not neceflary to detain
the House longer on that head.
However, another argument which has
! been frequently repeated, and particular
ly ur?ed by the gentleman lalt up (Mr.
> Gerry) requires some further animadver
' funs. It is, that by the law which de
fines the power of the Secretary, we are
bound to refer the revenue bulinefs to that
officer, and to receive the original plans
f-oin him ; that if we do not ait accor
ding to this law, we.will set a dangerous
example of difobeÂ«Tienee to the citizens.
Mr. Speaker, I aik, had the Houie of
ifrrei'c ntat.'ves a right to originate in the
rit indance r venue fyltems, before tin's
lÂ» made ? This I presume will not
kc denied ; if that Houle had the power,
rre not the powers of this Houle equally
lienfive? Can one Honfe of Reprefenta
iws abri-.!f;e or alienate the powers of
Bother Ms this can be done, we may
sway the wnftitutional powers ot

ir'nal plan, fur the very purpcfe in quef-

Mi/tqttent}y with the whole House, and
thry'cannot transfer it to a secretary,
pthe fcMte or to any officer, cr public
kdy on eatth.
The law in qceftion gives a capacity
to the fecrctary to prepare plans when we
direst him to do so ; it makes it his duty
(how far that law is proper, is another
Â«jueiliou). But the law docs not, nor
cannot, oblige us to call upon him to
do that duty, or reflrain us fiom doing
it ourltlves.
It talk much of our power to
hiifyfteraj; but this is not

icconftitution puts it in the
power of the representatiVes to give the
firft form to revenue plans, if they choose
to do it ; at lealt, that it was optional
with them previous to the law : if, there
fore. they cannot do it themselves without
all thole mifchievons confeqitences, it is
time to change the government itfelfâit
is much better to do so, avowedly and
deliberately, than in this insidious andin
diredfc manner. However, I wish we would
11 7 r rle' le experiment in a few inltan
ces, and if those bad elfeftsare produced,
l ' le . gentlemen's arguments in favour/of
their plan will receive experimental aid.
to the confufions of the
old government, I am at lome loss to
know what the gentleman means ; it is
true, the old Con rrefs was velted with a
confulion of powers, viz. legislative, exe
cutive, fee. but this is not the cafe with
U3 ; the old Congrels had also a confufed
manner of doing business ; they seldom
lud a full house : this circnmltance laid
them under the neceflity of referring much
of their business to the heads of depart
ments ; against doing which, the confe
deration had provided no such express
guard, as our constitution does ; I have
always apprehended, that, from that con
fufed habit of doing business, the pre
fect method of referring legislative af
fairs, to the heads of departments, found
its way into this house ; and it is against,
and not for, that old confulion, that I
contend.
With refpeft to the advantages arifin"
the Secretary of the TYeafury giv
ing the firfl principles, and oiiginal com
plexion to our revenue systems, they are
nated to be great and numerous ; but
they are well summed up, by the gentle
man from New-Yofk (Mr. Lawrance)
who fays, that to this method of doi.xr
bufinels, we are indebted for the retrieved
(late of our national affairs, for all our
wealth and prosperity. Surely if this
proves any thing, it proves too much ; if
the Secretary's influence and abilities can
| do so much good, it is a proof, that if he
j is either mistaken, or wants viitue, he may
by the exercise of this power, do much
hurm. According to this way ofreafoning
Congress mud be responsible for all that
is wrong, and the Secretary have the
credit of all that is done well; will any
pcrfon who fuptwrt* thi-s aflVrHon, pre
tend to si y, that -f entrusting the fe'cie
tary with originating r.fraÂ«.
ney biib, produced (uch important effects
that it does not veil him with the means
of an undue and dangerous influence.
But does the gentlemen believe that
the preient government, vetted with fnch
rxtenfive and eftcdive powers, and poffcf
fed of such ample means, would have left
those powers unexercifed, and those
ritans unapplyed ; that Congress would
have paid no itfpeA to the contradls, and
made no for the debts of the
Uiuted States, if the Secretary ha<J not
or inflated 'lie plans 1 surely this is not a
fuppofable cafe ; nor is it very conliftent
with another obiervation made by the
gentleman, when he told us, that the Se
cretary's preparing apian was attended
with no more influence than' would be
produced by the clerk of this House m
fertiug a clause in a biilâboth instances
being equally fubjeft to our control. I
would not content, nor do we permit our
clerk to originate systems; but if we
cannot do it ourselves, it would be much
more confident -and fafe, to trust it with
our clerk, who isÂ»wholly dependant on
the House, and may be liifmifTed by it at
pleasure, and has no patronage conneded
with hig office, than to entrust that potr
er with an executive officer, chosen by the
Prcfident, and dependant on him for his
continuance in office, and having an cn
creafing patronage connected with his of
fice. Certainly, fir, if an officer mast be
paid to originate our revenue systems, we
ought to provide that he should be ap
pointed by and dependant upon the House
of Representatives.
When we reflect upon the fabjeft, and
look rouni us, we will find no example
in the state governments to countenance
our conduit, and theie were the models
after which the government of the Union
w is tormed j nor is it pretended that the
Constitution under which we ad, and
have fvvorn to support, expressly gives a
ny such power, and I am persuaded that
the general Convention which originated
the government of the Union, nor the
State Conventions who adopted it, con
templated no such implication, as is now
contended for in lupport of our piaAice.

VI hen Mr. Adams's Defence of the American
Conttuniions firft appeared âa gentleman ob
(erved that it would be a very popular woik
tco yea is h?rce ; that it contained too many
solemn, ftiibborn truths to n. let general appro
bation at the prefrnt day ; that lime alone could
unfold and enforce their propriety, lullxe and
applicabilily to the constitution o't man. Mr.
Adams hai however lived to fee the truth cfone
important observation verified wiih refpeft to
himfelf, at a much earlier period than could
have been reafomhly expf&cd from the strong
opinion entertained by that gentleman, and o
ther diftinguiftied advocates for the high rc
ja-b:is.ju ofefcifcScr <)] tin. people of this ecntntrv.
The go'gon luad of party frews itf< If in itÂ«
proper form in the foiled States, and there is
the g'-ate't aspiehenfions entertain a by many
of the bi-ftfitends to the liberties of America,
that mertt, abilities, and ferviccs, in the person
of as great a patriot as this or any other country
ever, pioduccd, will be I'acrificed at its ilirine.
The re election of Mr. Adams to the office
of Vice-President, is perhaps as important to
the interests, peace and freedom of the United
States, at this period, as any erent of a fimiâ
lar nature ever can he to this countryâ
especially when if is confide red, that not one
enemy to Union ,or the Constitution is to
be found among his friendsâand that the most
a&ive of his enemies are known to poilefs feÂ»-
timents hostile to both.
The mode cf attacking the Vice-President
of the United States, in publi/hing mutilated
extracts from his writings, is fimiiar to that
of the Atheist, whoaffbrted thatheconldpro\e

PROPOSALS
FOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION
An AMERICAN EDITION of " *
Guthrie's Geography
IMPROVED.
OJ which theft are the terms :
1. TT (hall be publi(hed in 48 weekly numbers,
X each containing thiee (hefts,or Twenty.four
pages, of letter press, in quarto, printed with new
types on fine papei.
11. In the courle of the work will be delivered
about thirty large maps, of the fame (ize as thofc
tn the European editions, viz. mod of them fneei
maps on post paper.
gdr Re/lies the maps in the Britijh editions, this
pori will contain maps of as many of the United States
as can he readily procured, executed by the heft engrav
ers in the United States.
111. The price ol each number will be a quar
ter dollar, to be paid on delivery.ââfidjr Niad
vance refuired.
IV. The work will be put to press as soon as
ICO copies are fubferibed for.
V. Subscribers who disapprove of the work, on
the publication of the three firft numbers, are to
Ije at liberty to return them, and (hall have their
money repaid.
VI. The fubferibers' names (hall be prefixed as
patrons of the undertaking.
PerhaDS there is no science more entertaining
and ufeful than geogiaphy. It reveals the disco.
veries of travellersâthe remarkable curiosities of
a,I countries, in nature and artâthe situation of
provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, & moun
tainsâm fine, the history, manners, customs, laws,
â  ones, revenues, and government of different na-
It is an old observation, that " there is not a
son or daughter of Adam, but has some concern
with geography," and that a knowledge of this
fcicnce is indilpenfable towards the study of his
tory with advantage or fatisfaflion. Indeed a
man unacquainted with it, cannot dil'courfe on the
rnoucommou newspaper topics of the day without
betraying his ignorance.
So much for geography g ner.lly. With re.
Ipra to the present plan, let it fuffice to remark,
that Guthrie's Geography has be-n long acknow
rdged to be the bed in the English language:
however, the account of America in it has, Irom
obvious reasons, been very erroneous and defec
t've. The errors of former editions will be cor
reflrd, and the defefls supplied, by gentlemen of :
abilities, who have engaged to fuoenmend this
undertaking, and to avail itaemfdves of all the in
format on that can be procured, to render it the
molt complete edition extant.
The Printer earnestly solicits the support of his
rplioAA'-citizens throughout the United States: and
as no deposit is required, and evet y fublcribrr w,i!
