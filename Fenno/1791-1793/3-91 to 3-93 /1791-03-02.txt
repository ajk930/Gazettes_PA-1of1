CONGRESS.
TT was a prudent caution of the Egyptians, to
poflpone the giving a character tijl after the
death of the party. During a man's life his con
du<ft might change, and falfify the praise or'cen
fure bellowed upon it. But death, which fixes an
unalterable stamp, extinguilhes the paiiions which
have flattered, or abused, the living man. To
morrow the fir ft Congress will terminate its poli
tical life. Its whole condudi is before the public ;
fubjeiflto fuchadecilion, as truth will pronounce
lipon it.
Other public men have found the path of their
duty as beaten as the highway. Administration
running in the fame channel for ages, has worne
it deep and wide : Congress had a new path to
tread ; the conflitution, by fencing ic up on ei
ther fide, has made it a narrow one ; and such was
the state of the times, and of parties, that they
found it covered with thorns.
â¢ During the two years, Congress has, beeri en
gaged in business about 16 months. The book of
it's laws will fliew that it has been diligently en
gaged. Perhaps no body of men has ever at
tended more punctually at the daily hours of
meeting, or continued more closely occupied du
ring the fitting. The whole number has gene
rally voted. This however is an inferior kind
of merit. The great point which afFedts the re
putation of the body is, whether it's measures
have been wife and salutary.
The firft care of Congress, was to organize the
great departments of government. The merit
of the measure inay be tried by supposing a dif
ferent organization. If instead of a Secretary of
the Treasury, the business of finance had been
intrusted to a Treasury Board, of three or five
persons, let their good sense and integrity be e
ver lo it in ay be doubted whether
sn uniform felf cor.fiftent plan would have been
recommended or adopted. It is proper to try the
merit of the firft Congress, either by the differ
ence of the state of tilings, when it began, and
when it finifhed it's period, or by comparing what
Congress has done, with the manner of doing the
like things in the state legislatures. Leaving it
to the mind of every reader to purfuethele ideas
as far as he may think proper, it may be remark
ed, that Congress has so organized the great de
partments, as to secure an orderly, efficient and
uniform adininiftratiou of the government. -The
President with his usual prudence and discernment
has appointed able men to fill them ; who are
stimulated, by every motive, to a diligent and
active employment x>f their eminent talents. The
people will know where to bestow praise, and
on whom the blame should fall. This is the ad
vantage of eftablifliing heads of departments.
Provision is also made for a friendly intercourse
with foreign nations, by providing forMiniilers.
In the judicial department as much has been
done, as circumstances would admit. Judges
of eminent virtue and learning preside in the fe
deral courts. But the very narrow limits of the
judicial power of the United States, renders this
one of the most difficult branches of leglflation.
Coutts mud be ellabliflied, and provision made
to administer justice to men, almost at hojne,and
yet the business is very inconsiderable. This is
not the fault of.Congreft. If any thing is to be
regretted, it is, that a different arrangement had
not been nfade of the judicial power by the con-
fticution
The measures of Congress have given a great
Jpring to trade. The difference of tonnage and of
import on goods, if imported in American veflels
and the favours to the trade to India and China
have greatly increased thefhipping,as well as the
foreign trade. The coasting trade, no longer
fubjetft to State regulations is evidently gaining
strength. It has increased the tonnage and sea
menâit is already a young lion, and will afford
111 a few years such naval ltreiigtli, as to be a
terror to our enemies,
The duties 011 foreign manufactures are a di
rect bounty upon our own. The increase of manu
factures since Congress firft: imposed the duties,
is not certainly known. But every one who has
lived in the country the last two years, knows
that it is very extraordinary. Our exports have
increased to upwards of 20 millions of dollars.â
Many art of opinion, that our manufactures have
risen to an equal amount.
Future controversies between the States are ren
dered improbable, by the proviflou for an equi
table fettlemenc of the accounts, which the war
had swelled into a mass, so rmidable by its mag
nitude, and more so by its confufion. This very
difficult and necelTary talk has been accomplifli
ed, tho it had been despaired of by many.
The States have been eased of their debts,
which would have crushed some of them by their
weight. But the revenue of the whole country,
under one system of management, will enable
the United States to provide for them, almost
without feeling the burden. JVloderate taxes on
luxuries have made the reveuue chest overflow
with wealth.
The advantages of the funding system, are
not to be enumerated. America, at this moment,
is in a situation equally novel and refpeftable.â
It is in a condition for felf-defence, which can
not be too much admired. With an orderly go
vernment, an ample revenue, and almost unlim
ited credit and resources, it polTefles a strength,
which itftood in need of during the war. Popu
lar governments' fuffer more by the unsteadiness
of their measures, than by the corruption of their
rulers. It is thefirft time that a permanent sys
tem has been adopted in our country for support
ing credit. The people already enjoy the fruits
of it. The new capital is every where flying to
the aid of manufactures, trade and agriculture.
The Bank is an institution which our extensive
and wealthy country ought not to be without. It
will aflift us to extend our intercourse from North
to South, and we shall like one another better,
as we know one another more.
After every pacific mealure had failed ofeffett
with the Indians, protection is afforded to the
frontiersâOur frontier fellow-citizens, tho dif-
tant, are not neglected
It would be tedious to comment at large on the
several very important ac r ts of the firft Congress.
A mere Ikerch is intended. A great deal has been
done, and truth seems toanthorife us to fay, that
no very dangerous mistakes have been committed
in the two years. America, which was in the
Jhads before, seems now to Hand in the fmi-Jbtne.
Its profpetfs are the brightest that any nation on
earth enjoys : All that is wanting to realize them
is steadiness. If the next Congress should
make 110 violent alteration of meafures,our hopes
can scarcely meet with disappointment.
Tho great questions have called forth strong
paflions in Congress, it is a most grateful thing
to fee the harmony and mutual goodunderftand
ing, which subsist at the end of the two years of
its being. Opposition seems to have left no ftin<r
behind it. The Members will separate with an
high degree of personal regard and esteem.â
State prejudices and prepofl'efliont lose a great
part of their influence 011 the mind, when those
who at firft felt them, find themselves obliged to
acknowledge, on numberless occasions, the can
dor, patriotism, and high fenle of reditude and
honor, which diftiriguifh their opponents. The
ties of brotherhood and-mutual affeeftion, which
are to bind America together, ought to grow
stronger every day.

fork of Rappahanock river, 36 miles from the town of Dumfries,
30 from Frederickfburg, and 28 from Falmouth ; in a most
healthy part of the country :âConfiding of 2,000 acresâhalf clear

foil is good, lays well, abounding with many excellent springs and
streams of water, so dispersed as to afford great opportunity of
making watered meadow of the firft quality,perhaps more than 300
acresâof which 120, in one body, is already in grass, and all wa
tered and drained at pleasure by a number of ditches, for that pur
pose, patting through the whole. Orchards of about 2000 bear

other kinds of fruit, natural to the climate. A good dwelling
house, the situation whereof is remarkably beautiful and pleasant ;
and many other valuable improvements of divers kinds.
And one other Plantation about 5 miles nearer said towns, con
lifting of about 1500 acres, on which is good merchant, grift, and
/aw mills, where nature, labour and art, have fully conspired to
render them complete; a large constant stream, on which they
stand, affords them water in gieat abundance; convenient thereto
is a kiln end house, for drying corn, a bake house, a dwelling

fubjeift of a Mint.
(CONTIKUED.)
THE neceflitv of fulfilling prior engagements, is a cause or pre
text for poflponing the delivery of the coin in lieu of the
bullion. And this delay creates a difference in the market price
of the two things. Accordingly, for some years pad, an ounce of
standard gold, which is worth in coin 17 lOj sterling, has
been in the market of London, in bullion, only Â£.%. 17 6, which
is within a small fraction of one half per cent, lei's. Whether this
be management in the mint to accommodate the bank in the pur
chase of bullion, or to effect indire&ly something equivalent to a
formal difference of price, or whether it be the natural corn fe of
the bufinefo, is open to conjecture.
If, at the fame time, indicates, that if the mint were to make
prompt payment, at about half per cent, less than it does at pre
sent, the state of bullion in refpeft to coin, would be precisely'
the fame as it now is. And it would be then certain that the go
vernment would save expence in the coinage of gold ; since it is
not probable, that the time afi ially loft in the course of the year
in converting bullion into coin can be an equivalent to half per
cent, on the advance; and there will generally be at the com
mand of the treasury, a considerable sum of money, waiting for
some periodical dilburfement, which without hazard might be
applied to that advance.
In what sense, a free coinage can be said to promote the abun
dance of gold and silver, may be inferred fiom the instances,
which have been given of the tendency of a contrary system to
promote their exportation. It is, however, not probable, that a
very small difference of value between coin and bullion can have
any e ffett, which ought to enter into calculation. There can be
noinducement of positive profit, to export the bullion, as long as
the difference of price is exceeded by the expence of transport
ation. And the profpett of smaller loss upon the metals, than
npon commodities, when the difference is very minute, will be
frequently over-balanced by the poflibility of doing better with
the latter, from a rife of markets. It is at any rate certain that
it can be of no consequence, in this view, whether the superiority
of coin to bullion in the market be produced, as in England, by
the delay of the mint, or by a formal discrimination in the re
gulated values.
Under an impression, that a small difference between the value
of the coin, and the mint price of bullion, is the least exception
able expedient for restraining the melting down, or exportation
of the former, and not perceiving, that if it be a very moderate
one, it can be hurtful in other refpeftsâthe Secretary is inclined
to an experiment of J percent, on each of the metals. The fact,
which has been mentioned, with regard to the price of gold bul
lion in the Engliffi market, seems to demonstrate that such a dif
ference may fafely be.made. In this cafe there must be im
mediate payment for the gold and silver offered to the mint. How
far Â£ per cent, will go towards defraying the expence of the coin
age cannot be determined beforehand, with accuracy. It is pre
lumed, that on an economical plan, it will fuffice in relation to
gold. But it is not expetfed that the fame rate on silver will be
fiifficient to defray the expence attending that metal. Some ad
ditional provision may therefore be fouud neceffdry, if this limit
be adopted.
It docs not seem to be advisable, to make any greater differ
ence in regard to silver than to gold : because it is desirable, that
the proportion between the two metals, in the market, should cor
respond with that in the coins, which would not be the c'afe, if
the mint price of one was comparatively lower, than that of 'the
Other ; and because also silver being proposed to be rated in ref
petftogold, somewhat below its general commercial value, if
there (hould be a disparity, to its disadvantage, in the mint pri
ces of the two metals, it would obflru&too much the bringing of
't to be coined, and would add an inducement to export it. Nor
does it appear to the Secretary fate to make a greater difference,
between the value of coin and bullion, than has been mentioned.'
it will be better to have to increase it hereafter if this shall be
found expedient than to have it to recede from too considerable a
difference in consequence of evils, which shall lnve been experi
enced. r
It is sometimes mentioned, as an expedient, which, confidently
with a free coinage, may fetve to prevent the evils desired to be
avoidedâto incorporate in the coins a greater proportion of al
loy, than isufual, regulating their value nevertheless according to
the quantity of pure metal they contain. This it is supposed, by
adding to the difficulty of refining them, would cause bullion to
be preferred both for manufaflure and exportation.
But flrongobje&ions lie against this scheme An augmenta
tion ofexpence;âan actual depreciation of the coin aÂ°danger
of ltill greater depreciation in the public opinion ; the facilitating
o . fco Â» n 'Â« r Â«Â»s : wtllle 11 ' s questionable, whether it wonld have
the effect expected from it.
The alloy being esteemed of no value, an increase of it is evi
dently an increase of cxpence. This, in relation to the gold coins,
particularly, is a matter of moment. It has been noted, that the
alloy in them confills partly of silver. If to avoid expence. the
addition (hould beof copper only, this would spoil theappeaiance
ot the coin, and give it a base countenance. lis beauty would in
deed be injured, though in a less degree, -even if the usual pro
portions of silver and copper should be maintained in the tncrcaf
ed quantity of alio).
And however inconsiderable iin additional expenditure of cop.
per in the coinage of a year may be deemed ; in a series of years
it would become of consequence. Im regulations which contem
platethe lapse and operation of ages, a very small item ofexpence
acquires importance.
The .xflual depreciation of the coin, by an increase of alloy, re
mits from the very circumstance, which is the motive to itâthe
greater difficulty of refining. In England it is customary for
thole concerned in manufaftuies of gold to make a deduction in
the price, of four pence sterling per ounce, of fine gold, for every
carat which the mass containing it is below the legal standard
". a â¢' e . â¢"of a single carat, or 1-24 part
fl S J 'ld coinsÂ°f the United States, compared with the Er.gliffi
standard would cause the fame quantity of pure gold in them to
be woith nearly 4 _ 10 ths percent, less than in tile coins of Grea'-
Br.ta.n This circumstance would be likely, in process of time
to be felt in the market of the United S'atcs
A still greater depreciation, in the public opinion, would be to
be apprehended from the apparent debasement of the coin. The
â¢ ofi magi nation and prejudice cannot fafely be difre E arded
in any thing that relates to money. It t he beauty of the coin be
impaired; it may be fouud difficult to fatisfy the generality of the
community, that what appears worse is not really less valuable"
and it is not altogether certain, that an impression of its beini? s o '
may not occasion an unnatural augmentation of prices '
Gr< ater danger of imposition, by counterfeits, is also to be at>-
prehended from the injury which will be done to the appearance
of thecoin. It is a just observation, that " The perfection of the
coins is agreat fafe-guard against counterfeiters." And it is evid, nt
that the colour, as well as the excellence of the workmanship.is an in
gredient in that peifeftion. The intermixture of too much alloy
particularly o. copper in the gold coins at least, mud materially
lessen the facility of distinguishing by the eye, the purer from the
Daler kind, the genuine from the counterfeit.
The ineffieacv of the arrangement to the purpose, intended to
be answered by it, is rendered probable by different confuta
tions. If the standard of plate in the United States should be re
gulated. according to that of the national coins; it is to be ex
petted, that thegoldfmith would preferthefe to the foreigncoins â 
because he would find them prepared to his hand, in "the date'
which he desires ; whereas be would have to expend an additional
cuantity of alloy to bring the foreign coins to that date. If the
ltandard of plate, l>y law or usage, ftiould be superior to that of
the national coins, there would be a poflibility of the foreign[coins
bearing a higher price in the market ; and this would not only
obftrutt their being brought the mint, but might occasion the
exportation of the national coin in preference. It is not under
stood, that the pra6lice of mak:ng an abatement of price for thr
inferiority of standard, is applicable to the Englilh mintâand if
it be not, this would also contribute to fruftrating the expelled
effect from the increafeof alloy. For, in this cafe, a given quan
tity of pure metal in our standard, would be worth as much there,
as in bullion, ot the English or any other standard.
