PHILADELPHIA
THE ChiefsoftheFive Nations, last Monday week, met the Go
vernor in the Council-Chamber, to return a lormal answer to
his address, delivered to them, in the lame place, on the 28th ult.
SAGOYEWATHA, or RED JACKET, firft addrellcd his
Excellency, as follows :
Brother Onas * Governor,
OPEN unprejudiced ears to what we have to fay. Some days
since you addreiled us, and what you said gave us great pleasure. ,
This day, the Great Spirit has allowed us to meet you again in
this Council-Chamber. We hope that vour not receiving an im- .
mediate answer to your address, will make no improper impres
sion upon your mind.
We mention this, left vou should fufpeft, that your kind wel
come and friendly address, has not had a proper effett upon our
hearts. We allure vou it is far otherwifc.
Brother, Onas Governor,
In your address to us the other day, in this ancient Council
chamber, where our forefaiheis have often converl'ed together, se
veral things (truck our attention very forcibly. When vou told
us this was the place in which our forefathers often melon peace
able terms, it gave us sensible pleasure and more joy than we couh
express.
Brother, Onus Governor,
Though we have not writings like you ; vet we remember of
ten to have heard of the friendfhip that existed between our fore
fathers and yours. The pi&ure to which you drew our atten
tion + brought frefh to our minds the friendly conferences that
used to be held between the former Governors of Pennsylvania,
and our Tribes, and (hewed the love which your forefathers
had of peace, and the friendly disposition of our people. It
>s ftillour wish, as well as yours, to prefcrve peace between our
Tribes and you, and it would be well if the fame spirit existed a
mong the Indians to the Westward, and through every part of
the United States.
Brother, OrtAs Governor^
You particularly exprefTed, that you were wrll p'eafed to find,
that we differed in disposition from the Indians Wellward. Your
difpofitioo is that for which the ancient Onas Governors were re
markable. As you love peace, (o do wÂ» also ; and we wifa it
could be extended to the mod distant parts of this great country.
Brother, Onas Governor,
We agreed in council this morning, that the Tenements I have
exprefled, should be communicated to you, before the delegates
of the Five Nations, and to tell you. that your cordial welcome to
this city, and the good sentiments contained in your address, have
made a deep impreflion on our hearts, have given us great joy,
and from the heart I tell von so. This is all I have to fay.
AGWELONDONGWAS, or GOOD PETER, next addres
sed the Governor.
He fuft congratulated the delegates of the Five Nations upon
so happy and friendly a meeting, and on having so good an op
portunity of (hewing their peaceable disposition, and ot answer
ing the Governor's friendly address, which had given them io
much pleasure ; then turning to the Governor he began :
Brother, Or.as Governor,
I rake part in the joy you feel, in meeting your brothers of the
Five Nations at this day on such peaceable terms, and I rejoice
with my brethren of the Five Nations, on the fame account. This
meeting brought to my rccolleftion the days when our forefathers
were united as brethren.
Brother, Onas Governor t
Lei me tell you how much I wifli, that the hearty friendftiip
â which subsisted between our forefathers ftiould fubfiil equally be
tween their children. What is there more desirable than that we,
who live within hearing of each other, should unite tor the com
mon good. This is my wifti. It is the wtfli of my nation, al
though I am sorry I can't fay, of every individual in it ; tor there
are differences of opinion among us, as well as among our white
brethren.
Brother, Onas Governor,
Your country is happy. It has a complete and firm govern
ment, whose peace is secured, and where all obey your voice.
We are in a different fituction. Our government is not eftablifh
Â«d like yours, and though many attend to the voice of our coun
cils, yet some don't, especially the young men. They fometimcs,
however, alio do hear us.
Brother, Onas Governor,
I have been long acquainted with some cufloms, and in a de
gree with the natuie of your governments, and especially with
n Â£ ovrmrn ent of this State, and of the difficulties you had in
cibblifhing it ; and I with you to remember, that your forefa
thers laboured much, notwithstanding ihofe difficulties, to live
10 T^ Ce us ' P rotc & us, notwithstanding our weaknesses.
Dc Â» Brother, Onas Governor, that we shall derive some
a ting benefit from this visit to your city, and carry home with
an imprcfiion on our minds, that will make us keep Onas in
mmd. This is ail I ftiall fay.
' he Governor t'nen delivered the following reply :
Brother s,
You have spoken the language of friendfhip and peace.
rejoice to find that our sentiments, upon the piefent occasion,
arr rtiuch alike; for I am persuaded, that the happiness of your
nations, us well as of the United States, will be bell promoted b.y
a mutual regard, and the liberal exchange of good offices.
I hope, ind-ed, that, when the other Indian Nations behold
the drifts of the harmony cftaWifhed between us, they will cn

COMMON SENSE,
f To the rARMFRS simds Greeting.
I ""HE holders ot the .blic debt arc held up to view in various
A oair u: lights. \ hey are caPed harpies,cheats, robbers, &c.
It in pri- :te life â¢ y ar" really bad men, they will be despised js
bad men alw~ iarc. If they have done any thing against law,
the law Â«.Â«â¢ ~jjrn to punifli thein. There ar? charges against them
as eli v 1 .in?.l men, more proper for a grand jury than a newspa
per. T hole who have any thing to do with them, will look to
their pnncipjes ot moral conduct. The public has nothing to do
"i the affair of their private chara&ers but the rage of those who
<2 i them such hard names, carries them to other assertions. It is
pretended that every other order ot men has fuffered in propor
tion as thefajjmcn have profiled by the funding fyftern. To give
a food colof? to thf.r auger, anil to gain adherents, they affett to
ie*l conteine-d for the injury fuffeied by tbe landed inter eft.âls
there anv ground for faying that the landed interest has fuffered
by the funding ast ?
The price of land has rifcn in consequence of that act. The
great increase of a&ive property has promoted foreign trade, <o
that the market for the produce of the land in foreign countries,
is induftriouflv fought out and supplied. It is not only easier tor
a farmer to fell his land than formerly, but it is alio less difficult
to borrow money to pay off legacies, or to make improvements.
Canals also, and roads, and schools, and innumerable advantages
to the country in general, and many of them peculiarly and emi
nen'ly beneficial to jhe farmers, are set on foot, which would
not have been (o much as thought of, had not the means ol fun
plying such expences been increased by converting the public
debt to such a6tively ufetul purposes. By these means, as well as
by the spirit of the farmers themselves, the landed interest is
growing in wealth and importance more rapidly than any in the
United States. The increase of this most valuable order of men,
in point of numbers, exceeds all the other orders of society put
together; for all our new settlements are wholly compoled of
farmers. And yet this is the class of men who are internperately
told in every paper, that they are fuffering and finking in conse
quence of the taxes, to pamper up the certificate men.
It will be said, the public debt is a public burden, and it falls
on the farmers. True, it falls on all consumers of foreign arti
cles. It is a burdenâbut is the burden increased by funding ihe
debt? Take the answer from matter of fact. Before the debt
was funded, heavy direst taxes were paid, and yet :ts credit funk
to almost nothing. It did not answer as money. Since the new
government funded the debt, it has been railed above par with
cash ; and the taxes have been scarcely felt, and not felt at all to
the oppreflion of any body.

ODE to CHARITY.
HATL, Spirit of Heav'n, tail !
Well do I know thy seraph form,
Descending from the realms of light :
The foul-enlivening grace !
That well the torpid heart might warm,
Spread o'er thy lovely face :
Thine eye with sweet companion bright;
Hail, Spiiit of Heav'n, hail !
When firft descended from the sacred throne,
The Jlar of piety to walk the earth ;
To clasp round purer hearts her blazing zone,
And warm the mind into a heav'nly birth :
Her daughter thou, where'er thefpirit turn'd,
Gave thy sweet temper to the generous foul ;
Whose breast with piety since then hath burn'd,
Feels god-like Charity pervade the whole.
Hail, Spirit of Heav'n, hail!
Warm'd by thy melting breath,
Benignant How a r d fought the dreary jail,
To snatch the fufferer from the g r asp death.
Mov'd by thy impulse, where the ghastly crew,
F.'er-gnawing famine, flaring horror dwell,
And peftilenceof ever-fick'ning hue,
Her fateful breath around her blew;
He smiling trod nor fear'd those fiends of hell.
When thy life-giving light
Beam'd thro' the big round tear
That started from his pitying eye !
The wretch whose hopeless fight,
Beheld 'till then, flafii thio' the dungeon's night,
Nought save convulsed figures ol despair;
Felt his heart beat with new-born joy :
Such his unutterable extacy,
As fill'd the foul of him whose eye,
'Till manhood's prime, was wrap'd with clouds around,
And now his fight full found,
Now firft beheld the world, and the bright blazing wonders
of !
Thou pour'd'ft thy music from his tongue;
And as of old, when to the fiend of hell,
Immortal Orpheus brearh'd his melting song.
The curjcr's madness fell;
While fix'd in death-like filcnce all around,
Furies forgot their rage, and lift'ned to the found :
So when to tyrant Kings he spoke
The just complaint of fubjefts griev'd,
By laws which cruelty had form'd ;
Thev felt their iron fouls with pity warm'd,
Their frames, for once, with anguifti shook;
They wifh'd, they crav'd to be relirv'd
From fccnes, which starting to their view,
Of tortur'd wretches piere'd their bosoms through.
The lifl'ning Angels, leaning from the sky,
To hear him urge ihe melting tale,
Accordant breath'd a pitying ftgh,
That flew to earth, borne on a heav'nly gale.
Sound high with one accord, they fatd,
The warbling flute, the (weeping lyre ;
Let (acred fame to him be giv'n,
Who fill'd with Charity from Heav'n ;
To raise a hopeless brother's head,
To flop the fountains of despair,
Explores the gloomy dungeon's (Vade,
Where death and lamine (talk around
The wretch condemn'd to fetters on the ground.
And pierce him thro' with p?*ns 'till tortui d Hie expire.
Too great âtoo good to live below !
O ! may he soon our high-born rapture know ;
To Heav'n be call'd where from our Angel tongues
Cel'ftial music falls, and varying flows in our melodious song!
A!i ! soon âtoo soon for man tne pray'r wai heard !
God spake the final word ;
The moital (aw the beck'ning hand,
And mounted into Heav'n at God's command.
Hail, Spirit of Heav'n, hail!
Tho' call'd from earth's deep night,
li;to the boundless realms of living light,
The tendereft, noblest fori!
O ! bid thy power fttll prevail,
Still, dill diffufe ihy spirit o'er
The human foul, from where the fun
Bums in the East, to where he gilds the (urge
Thatdafhing foams along th-- wcltern Ihore.

' We learn from Ceutathac Don J. Barcela, our
interpreter, has been nuirthered by the Gover
nor of Tetuan, under the fan<ftion of a fl;lg of
peace. Don Barcela repaired to the cam]) before
Ceuta, when the Governor of Tetuan perceiving,
him, without aliening any reason tor the at!t,
(hot him with a pillol. Don Barcela, who was
on liorfeback, fell immediately. His head was
sent by the Governor to the King of Morocco,
which proves that he was aflaflinated by the or
ders of that monarch.
His Royal Highness the Prince of Walts, the
patron of ingenuity and ta!le, was about t-vvo yearn
fir.cethe purchaferof a fnuff-boxthosornamented
and contrived :âlt was a double box opening on
both fides, with rims of gold. On one fide, a
splendid medallion appeared in the centre, round
which was a row of large pearls. When this fide
of the box was placed upwards upon the table,
the medallion upon a very flight preH'ui fcopened,
and an artificial goldfinch, executed in gold anil
coloured, so as to have a very near resemblance
to nature, sprung up. 'I he bird picked its wings,
hopped round the little circle allotted it, and,
for about two minutes, chirped the few notes
making the morning song of the goldfinch, lc
then parted into a delightful air of Haydn's, and
gave it so well, that the notes night have been
lillened to for their found, as well as for the cu
riosity of their production. So ended its perfor
mance and its appearance
A thousand guineas was the reward given by
he Prince to the mechanist of this admirable
fnuff-box.
The following hint, of importance to owners
and occupiers of lands, is given by Mr. Leyburn,
jun. of Hunmanby. This gentleman fays, that
in order to prevent manure finking too Jeep in
low and springy meadow or palture land,a I ufHci
ent quantity of the strongest lime that can be got,
should be laid on it ; that he has used Knotting
ley lime wit h great fnccefs ; the quantity not less
than 6 chaldrons to a statute acre, to be laid on
in the winter season. In 12 or ij months after,
by pntting a spade into the ground, it will be
found that the lime will be formed into a solid
body, which will prevent manure finking any
â¢lower than the lime, and consequently the lands
will receive benefit so long as the manure will
lalt. The lime should be laid in heaps til] it be
very wet, before it be put on the land.
The Ihip Grange, arrived at Liverpool from

BOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY, March 8.
Debate on the resolution reported by ast left commit
teeâThat the Secretary of the Treasury be diretf
edto report'his opinion to the House, on the befl
mode of raising thofi additional /applies vihich the
public fcrvice m*y require for the current year.
MR. PAGEâI (hall always vote against a mo
tion for applying to the Secretary of the
Treasury for information refpeifting the means
of procuring the sums of money neceflary for the
exigencies of government.
It is no argument to me to be told that the a<?t
which established the department, at the head of
which that ofiicer is placed, authorises that mo
tion. That aift may be plead as obligatory on
the Secretary to reply to such enquiry when made
by Congress, but not to induce this House to make
such enquiry. Whan that a<ft, which is now
urged in juftification of the motion before the
House, was under the confederation of the House
which formed it, I raised my feeble voice against
itâl endeavored to fltew that the powers given
to an ofiicer, who was appointed by the Preli
dent and Senate, and removeable by the Preli
dent alone, were such as were utterly incompa
tible with the principles of the constitution, and
perhaps with the letter of it, as that does not per
mit even the independent Senate, the represent
atives of the legislatures of the several states, to
originate a money bill. I remarked that if the
bill palled, it would verify the predictions ofthe
afiti-federalifts, as they were called, and would
Jilarm many friends of the new government â1
observed that the practice of the former Con
gress, which was adduced as a precedent for such
applications to the Secretary, for his statements
and reports, was not a cafe in point ; as the
Congress under the confederation was looked
upon as a mere diplomatic body, whofea&s were
reviled, approved or rejected by the Itate aflem
bliesâwhich (hews that it was immaterial who
planned the schemes of finance, âwhence infor
mation was derived, or who drew the atfls of the
then Congress ; as they were not, as the laws ol
the present Congress are, paramount to the laws
of all the dates.âl contended, Sir, that it was
the peculiar duty of this House, to originate mo
ney bills, and to devise ways and means, as they
are calledâl am still moll decidedly of the fame
opinion ; and I think with the member from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzfimons) that such a refer
ence to the Secretary of the Treasury, is a dere
liction of our duty, and an abandonment of the
trust reposed in us ; & that many other references
must have the appearance of an unbecoming in
dolenceâl am also of opinion with the member
from Georgia, (Mr. Baldwin) that if ever we
make a stand, it should be on this ground.
I will add, that it is high time to make that
stand.âFor a bill having palled which was op
posed as dangerous to the constitution, and ut
terly incompatible with the principles of a free
government, and indeed as inconlilfent with the
plain conftru<Ttion, and I may fay the very lat
ter of our own constitution ; and that bill be
ing now appealed to as a juftification of a moti
on which can be supported on no other princi
ples, but such as inay be used to subvert our go
vernment, and to introduce a monarchy, as un
limitted as that lately rvboliflied in Franceâfor
surely if more wisdom can be found in a few
heads of departments, than in the whole repre
sentative body of the peopleâand if those heads
can be made responsible, whilst the representa
tives are free from responsibility, and dispatch
and energy can be obtained without theexpence
of a Congress, or of this House at least ; I fee not
why the people might not make a favorite Presi
dent as absolute as the kings of France have been
and call on Congress, like the Parliainentsof Pa
ris, only to register his edidts. 1 fay, as this is
the cafe, it is high time to make a stand But we
are told that the heads of departments are re
cognized by the constitution, and the business
now required of one of them sanctioned by law
and we are also told of precedents eftablilhing
and authorising this mode of proceedingâit is
f irely then high time for every member, who
views that law and such proceedings under it,
in the light 1 do, to join with the member from
Georgia, and make a stand, as he called itâAnd
I trust, Sir, that rather than fufFer that law to
be thus resorted to, they will unite to amend or
repeal it.
I repeat it, Sir, here we ihould make a (land ;
for however well intended such measures may
be, and the arguments in support of them, their
tendency is mischievous, ana ought to be opposed
by every friend to a free government.
The bills establishing the departments of go
vernment, have strong monarchical features ;
and have too often led Congrels into the steps
of monarchical governments. The republican
part of the Britiih government, rely on a com
mittee of ways and meansâthe heads of depart
ments being members of the House of Com
mons, are always forward to take the lead
in the plans or proje&s of the Crownâand
they have so ingeniously involved the plans
of finance, that few understand the myfterioos
business, and therefore it is in the minister's
hands alone.âSir, the House of Commons always
severely scrutinize their plans, and are not foob-
I'equious to their minilters, as some gentlemen
are disposed to be to our Secretaries.
But what would Englishmen fay, if their Par
liament were to pais such a bill as this now re
ferred to ; and Ihould call on a man, not a mem
ber of either House, but appointed by the King,
with the advice indeed of the House of Lords,
removeable however by the King alone ; to lay
before the House of Commons a plan of ways
and means ? Would the people of England be
fatisfied with the strange story of his responsibi
lity ? And of his superior abilities ? But what is
this responsibility so much talked of ? The Pre
sident may dismiss the Secretary from his office,
or this House may impeach himâbut when the
President and Congreis both are his accomplices,
who will dismiss or who impeach, and where then
is his responsibility ? And what is to become of
the people's rights, if this be the cafe, and this
House be not accountable to the people for its
adts ? as a member yesterday said.
But, Sir, I wi!l noc alk what Englishmen would
fay on such an occasion, I will tell you what
Americans have saidâThey have said, that un
der this boasted a<st, you might as well apply to
the President in the firft instance, as to any head
of department under him, were it not for their
virtue ; and that at the rate Congress have pro
ceeded in some cases, their rights are at the mer
cy of departments. But here we are asked, if
we have not wisdom enough to reje<ft an impro
per plan, how we could be fuppol'ed capable of
deviling a good one ?âTo this, Sir, I fliall only
reply, that when we have done our best, welhall
have discharged our duty ; and our bills will at
lealt be fiamed according to our constitutionâ
and the doubting members may ask the opinion
of the Secretary, if they please. One member
endeavored to ridicule republican jealousyâl
thank God, although I am a republican, I know
where todiretfl my jealous attention ; and where
and when to repose confidence ; when to llrength
en government, and when to restrain it.
We were aiked indeed, are you afraid of truth,
and unwilling to receive inftruiSion ? I answer
noâTruth is our gl-eat object, and just informa
tion our only aimâbut to get at truth, refpetS
ing the moll likely means of railing a revenue,
with as little inconvenience as poflible to our
ronftituents, was I conceive, a principal object
in the view of the framers of our constitution,
when they instituted this House of Representa
tives. In this House alone I should search for
truth, refpecfting this important queftionâfrom
the representatives of the states 1 (hould expecft
to receive all the necefl'ary information refpetft
ing it ; and if the Secretary be poffefled of vouch
ers or further information, the House should call
for it.âln the committee of the whole, every en
quiry (hould be madeâresolutions be proposed,
examined, amended, and when maturely consi
dered and approved by the House, where all the
further information which the heads of depart
ments can give may be called for, our bulinefs
would be done. 1 fay this is the way for Con
gress to get at information, and to arrive at truth
âbut to apply in the firft instance to a single in
dividual, mult beimproperâto an individual cir
cumstanced as the heads of departments are ;
that is removeable by the President ; liable from
the infirmity of human nature, to local attach
ments, to imposition, even of ingenuity and good
sense ; 1 mean the imposition ot their own the
oretical reasoning, borrowed from writers on oo
vernments not altogether refemblingour own.
Whatever he should propose, would come witli
such advantages as to require much time, and
perhaps more penetration than this House could
readily command, to fee through and rejed:, if
improperâbut some, I know, are of opinion that
a Secretary may venture to propose what no mem
ber would be hardy enough to mentionâSome
have doubted whether the Funding Syitein, the
Afl'umption, or the Excise could have been intro
duced by any other meansâlf this be true, and
these schemes be such as in the iflue of them (hall
be attended with happy consequences, so far as
we have gor.e, such applications to the Secretary
were rightâbut it is unmanly, and unbecoming
the representatives of freemen, to acl in this man
nerâto adopt measures which we dare not pro
pose, and to applaud them because they were
planned by this or that Secretary.âlt is ungene
398
rous to hold up a Secretary as responsible for er
rors adopted by Congressâand it is unreasonable
to impose upon Inn, a talk which, althoflirh our
peculiar duly to perform, we (brink from. The
multitude of references already made to the Se
cretary of the Treasury, and the necessary length
of route of hit reports, leave him no leisure to
attend properly to the different branches of his
own department.
But what information do we alk ? VVe know
the estimates of expences for the present yearâ
We have estimates of the probable amount of
the revenueâand we have called for a report of
the amount of furplufles, if any, in the treasury
We can theu, as well as the Secretary, determine
whether any additional revenue will be necelfo
ry ; and if so, we alone ought to devise the ways
and means of raising it. If dispatch is necellary
it is better to determine here at once what is to
be done, than to apply to the Secretary, w h o f e
plans we inay, after long debates, reject As to
the Secretary of the Treasury, 1 acknowledge
his abilities ; 1 know too that some of his reports
do honor to his heart, as well as to his headâ
his gallant behaviour in the late war, has com
manded my highest refpedi and esteemâbut I
owe too much refpecft to our cauntry to agree
to the resolution before you 1 wish, there
fore, that this House would refer only such
cases to him, as they cannot decide on without
official information in his handsâand chat in the
present cafe, the House would, in a committee
of the whole on the state of the Union, take un
der their consideration the means of raising the
supplies which may be found necellary for the
support of government, and protection of the
frontiers.

Philadelphia, April 11.
The Statue of Dr. Franklin was last Saturday fixed in its
niche, over the front door of the new library in Fifth-ftreet.
Francois Lazzarini is the sculptor, and Carrara the name
of the place where it was executed. It the intrinsic merit of this
master-piece of art did not speak its value, the name of the artist,
where he is known, would evince it. Heie perhaps its price may
give the best idea ot its worth. We have heard, but not from
such a quarter, however, as positively to warrapt the affertiou,
that it cost above 500 guineas.
The Statue ot Dr. Franklin is a full length figure, erect, clad
with a Roman Togaâthe position easy and graceful in the right
hand is a sceptre reversed, the elbow resting on books placed on
a pedestalâthe left hand, a little extended, holds Â» scroll.
Proposals for carrying the Mail of the United States, agreeable
to the ast for establishing the Poft-Office, which takes place the
firft of June next, are advertised for by the Postmaster-General
the terms to be given in by the firft of June.
By accounts from Cape-Francois, to the beginning of March,
it appears that the civil comtniflioners sent by the King and the
Colonial Assembly do not agree âthe consequence is a continu
ance of the diflentions which diftraft that unhappy country.
Sixty-four dwelling houses ; nine kitchens independent of the
houses, and eleven (tables, were built in this city last year.
On Saturday last a meflage was delivered to the legislature of
the State, in which the Governor mentions, that he had repaid the
loan of Â£ 60,000 to the Bank of North America ; and that he had
finally fettled and discharged the legiflatiye grant to the Proprie
taries. The meflage was accompanied with a full acquittance of
the claims and demands on account of that grant.
Friday last arrived in this port the barque Neptune, Captain
Earlr, from Calcutta, which (he left the 26th of November, at
which time lord Cornwallis had marched from Bangalore, pre
paratory to the re-commencement of his operations against Se
ringapatam, the capital of Tippoo's dominions âA fhipthat had
been sometime ready to fail for England, was detained to carry
home his lordship's dispatches, which it was fuppufed would
contain an account of the event of tbt expeditions.
The fine new (hip Prefideot Washington, built in the State of
Rhode-Island, wai fold at Calcutta, in November last, for 140,000
ficra rupees, or 15,000!. sterling.
The accounts from India, by the Neptune, state, that a pesti
lential distemper, piobably the plague, prevails in various parts of
that countryâthat in addition to the other forts taken by tne troops
under Lord Cornwallis, he has captured Nundydroog; this place
was carried by llorm, and was a poll of conliderable strengthâ
That Seringapatam, Tippoo's capital, is in great diftrets for pro
visions, owing to a long droughtâThat the Engli(h army is en
camped 14 miles from Bangalore. Keencopy is another hill fort
which has surrendered, and leveral others are invested.â That
Lord Cornwallis expe&ed to be before Seringapatam by the firft
of NovemberâThat a marauding party of Tippoo's army had
taken about 900 bullocks belonging to the grand armyâThat
Gurrumcundah, a place in pofleffion of Tippoo's forces, was be
sieged by the Nizam's army, one of the Enghlh allies ; but they
met with great oppositionâThat a party of Mahrattas had been
defeated by a detachment from Tippoo's forcesâThat Tippoo
had recently put to death great numbers of Englilhand native pii
foners in a roost savage manner. The drought had prevailed very
extensively, and grain had in confequetice greatly advanced in
piice. Rice was felling Irom to 8 rupees per bag.
An account was received by a passenger in the Neptune, of a
dispute between a French and Englilh frigate; in conferenceol
which, a broadlide was fired into the French veflel, by which a
number of men were killed. The Englilh frigate was the Thames.
This frigate had the last dispatches from the British Government
in India. Lord Cornwallis had not commenced an attack on Se
ringapatam ; and his operations hitherto, were not considered in
a very important point of view.
DESCRIPTION.âFROM QUEBEC.
The Mefiafago Chief is a person 6 feet highâabout 45 years of
age, of a very (our and morose countenance, and apparently very
cratty and subtle. His dress was Indian hose and moccafons, a
blue petticoat that came half way down his thighsâan European
waistcoat and fourtout ; his head was bound with an Indian cap
that hung half way down his back, and almost entirely filled with
plain silver broaches to the number of more than two hundredâ
he had earrings to each ear, the upper part of each was form
ed of th r ee silver medals about the size of a dollarâthe lower part
was formed of quarters of dollars, and fell more than 12 inches
from his earsâone from each ear over his breastâthe other over
his backâhe had three very large nose jewels ot silver that were
curiously painted. The account he gave of the a&ion, was, That
tfiey killed -.400 of the Whites, with the lols of g only of their
party, one of whom killed himfelf by accideut.âOur informant
is full in the opinion, that the British have not in any mftance
encouraged the Savagesâbut that the Refugees are very bitter a
gamft the United States. He was frequently in companv with the
MefTafago and other Chiefs at the House ot a gentleman who was
a linguiil to thefavages, and from him derived this information.
We hear, that on Thursday evening the Trustees of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania elected their Profeflorsâwhen the Rev. Dr.
Ewing, the Rev. Dr. Andrews, Dr. James Davidfon, Mr. Robert
Patterfon, the Rev. Dr. Rogers, and Rev. Dr. Helmuth, were
duly chofct).

The New-York Journal conta'ns a letter dated Port-a*-Prince
March 16âwhich lays that the Negroes on the plains ol Leoganc
have revolted and embodiedâthat on the 12th March their whole
force entered the town of Lcogane, but by the whiles and mulat
tos they were driven out again, and in a desperate action which
ensued, report fays that 2000 ot the revolters were killed. Near*
ly 56 plantations were burnt and ruined by thcni.
A writer in the Freeman's Journal points out the following, a
mong o(herdeteÂ£h in the patent system :
There is no fufficient provision to render patents furreptitiouflv
obtained, voidable ; in cafe patent privileges uic violated, com
petent provilion to obtain redress and damages is not made iu the
lawâpatents may be issued to twenty dirtcrent peifons for the
fame thingâthere being no mode for trying and alcertdimng the
meritsof the applications ; a more perfetfc system therefore ap
pears absolutely necessary iu justice uot ouly to many ingenious
citizens who have expended much time and money in pro
fecuiing thetr inventions, but alto to the public who are now de
prived of the benefit of their ufeful discoveries. Every tree citi
zen has an inherent right to the acquisitions ot his labor and in
dustryâbut if there is any property which appears from any pe
culiar quality to have a superior claim to the piote&iou of law and
government, it is that which a perfou derives from the exertions
ot his mental faculties.
Our fyftemsof finance arefnd to be servile copies of the British.
One would fnppofe the ault finders would scorn to copy ; but
the terms in which this charge is made and the tenor ot the com
plaints in the newspapers againlt the administration of the na
tional government,are all copies from old London papers. They
rail at the minijlry and corruption and court parajilcs, and jobbing
and forty orher cramp words that are not yet well understood lu
America. It would ease the virtuous labors of our fault finders
in their work of writing down an oppreflive government which
has crushed the people almost to death without their knowing it,
if an importation of tome old London papers were made. They
might take out paragraphs almost without changing a word which
would answer the purpose to a charm. Tne clergy it is thought
sometimes preach old feimons, and why ftiould not a like accom
modation be permitted to a dozen writers in the ncwtp3peis, who
virtuously take upon themselves the trouble of finding out ihe
grievances that the people do not fuffer and who are making thelc
grievances known so eloquently as to make ihem feel just as if
they did fuffer them. Make a man heartily angry with another,
and he will soon find or make a cause it he had none at firft. It
these worthy writers can make the people angry with their own
government, there is no doubt suspicion will find a multitude ot
devils and devils imps which are now invifibie. Hitherto ihcle
hunters for grievances have not found much game.
Three enlightened nations are enjoying freedom *-id prosperity
under three different forms of government. The kuowltdge ot
the best means of promoting the public liberty and happincls will
be improved by their experience.âWe lhall fee how diifeieitily
â¢hefe are affe&ed by the political systems Â»f America France and
England. Perhaps we (hall fee that eacii plan has its merit, who
has a right to dccide dogmatically that there is but one 1 ight way
in politics ? Yet there seems to be in some a persecuting ipirir, as
if the world was to be conveited to the true orthodox political
faith by force.
SHORT AT LEAST
TO pay, or not to payâthat is the question ?
To payâl'm ruin'd for a timeâperhaps.
To stopâmy chara&er is damn'd forever.

FOR S A L E,
BLOOMSBURY,
r T" , HAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
0 Trenton, in New-Jersey, occupied for many years past by
the subscriber; containing upwards of 200 acres of land, besides
a traa of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided hy the main street leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearlv
equal in quantity ; the ealtwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the said street on the ealf, and by the liver on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined effect of situ
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the 1110 ft
beautiful and desirable feats in the date. The manfion-houle is a
hand Tome, well-fmifhed brick building, 5 o by 40, containing lour
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing view of
ir n r'i' 130111 abovxan d below, as well as including the falls, and
alio of rrenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings arc a new fton:
coach-hou.e and (tables, fufÃcieut to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay; adjoining theft is a very complete granary,
rat proofs and a stone cow-house, upwards of 100 feet in length
containing thirty-one paved flails, over which is a roomy loftloi*
hay, &c Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is a gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the higlieit
" Jle Â°1 Culture, and abounding with a rich collection of the
choiccfl fruits of almost every kind, and several large alparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient diftancc from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well
built, Hone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheefe-rooin,
Ipring-houfe, garden, &c. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
cobs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and everv other ne
celfary out-building. The ground is properly divided into [mall
fields, all well watered, highly impioved, and chieflv undtr the
molt approved grass. This square has produced annually, for se
veral years past, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay,' belides
supporting through the summer season twenty to thirty homed
cattle, ami eight or ten horses. It contains alio two bearing or
chards of good fruit The river abounds, in the proper seasons,
with great plrnty of all kinds of fill, usually found in frrfh wa.e?
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl ; both of which
may afford a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. The
wnole of the land, except the wood-land, is inched and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar posts,
and rails of chefnut and white cedar. 1 !ie pu.chafir mav have
