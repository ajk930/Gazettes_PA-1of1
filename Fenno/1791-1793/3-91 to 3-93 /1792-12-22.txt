I" F perseverance can fnpply the want of
JL judgment, Mr. Jeflfcrfon has an excellent
advocate in the writer ofhis " Vindicatioh."'
But I if bis last attempt 11 not fouud
â to involve lliil more deeply the character he
wishes to extricate.
To repel the- imputation on Mr. Jtft'.-iTon,
arifuig from the advirt* which he gave toCon
jrrefs refp4ftingthe debt to France; he not only
lajors to (hew, that taken in all its circqm
ftances it is not of the exceptionable com
plexion ar:rlcâ¢- which it has been represented,
but endeavors to infufe a belief, that the
finfe of the extract originally communicated,
has been altered by the interpolation of cer
tain words as well as by the fuppreUion of a,
part of the paragraph, from which the extraTt
is derived.
Tt will flrike the moll careless observer, as
not a little extraordinary that a person (who
bn un lertakins to state the contents of a let
ith precise accuracy, and even to detest
jte verbal deviation, mult be under
o have access to the original)âTiould,
ntnJujf tn-t-lu public eye a itct
mfcript of that original, content liim
ith giving his own paraphrase of it, and
I expect that this would be accepted, up
ftrength of his afTurance, that it ex
hibits the genuine contents of the letter, on
the point in dispute contained in one para
graph onlyâ" That the arrangement of the idea
is the fame, and that in fubjiance, nothing has
been added to, or taken from it," thus mo
â deftly offering his own con/lruflion of fubjiance,
the very thing in question, for the thing it
â¢feif.
That the extract, as given by me, is tor
reft in every materia/ expression, is proved by
the statement in the vindication. That it
is literally correct, I must continue to believe,
until something more to lie depended upon
than coujlruQhc fubjiance,is offered in lien of it.
The information I pollefs, is drawn from
two sources; one a memorandum in the band
writing of a friend, which was given to me as
an exact tranfeript of the words of the letter,
and which was copied verbatim, in the second
of these papers;âthe other, a document of
mqucftio .able authenticity.notj o.ng since con
sulted, wh.ch ffates the contents of Mr. JeiÂ»
ferfon's letter in the'following form :â
Mr. Jefierfon suggests that " if there is a dan
ger of the public payments not being punctual,
whether it might not be better that the discon
tents which would then arise, should be trans
ferred from a court, of whose good will we
have so Diacb need to the breasts of a private
' company."
- " That the credit of the United States is
found in Holland, and that it would probably
not- be difficult to borrow iw that country the
whole sum of money due to the court of
France ; and to discharge that debt without
any deduction, thereby doing what would be
grateful to the court, and eftablifiling with
them a confidence in our honor."
This statement in the document alluded to,
serves to confirm the memorandum, in form
as well as substance. Speaking in the third
person, it represents Mr. Jefferfon as fuggejt
ing, " whether it might rot be better, )kc."
whence it is natural to infer, that speaking in
the firft person in the letter, the terms are,
< 4 1 submit whether it may not be better, &C.'*
The form of conveying the idea by way of
question, is common to both vouchers; and
the word u whether", which is also common
to both, p efuppofes the words u I fugged,"
or " I submit," the last being the most accu
rate, and in that view the most likely to have
been used.
It is observable, also, that the fame state
ment difconne&s the two proportions, and
gives them a diftin<sl ar>d independent afpe<st.
The conjunction " But," which is alledged to
be in the original, does not appear in that
statement.
It is poflible, never thelefs, that some imma
terial departures from literal preciflon, may
have found their way into the transcripts,
which are relied upon. But while this con
cefllon, as a hare poflibility is made, it is not
intended as an escape from a rigorous refpon
/ibility for the eflential accuracv of the diJ
clofure. If there be in what has been com
municated as a literal extradl, any expreflion
the leajl matei-a/ i tending to the crimination of
Mr. JefJerlou, which is not to be found in the
original, it is admitted to be inexcufabtp.â
But not having been podTefled of the original,
as has been several times stated, any acciden
tal variation of exprelijon, not affecting at
aH the sense of the quotation, or not affecting
it diiadvar.ta; poufly to Mr.JefFerfo'?,cannot be
admitted to be of moment; in regard either
to the merits wftned fcuffion,or to the fairnefs
oi- procedure. To press such a variance, as
an objedti' n, is to cavil, aud to betray a con
icioufnefs ot weakuefs.
Now, it happen?, that the variance, which
is alledged to exist, it" it has any influence up
on tie mean in 5 of the piA'age, has one favor
able to Mr. Jetferfon; taking it for granted,
that his Apologist has given a true account of
it. This will be seen by carefully contrail ins
the phraseology in the two cases.
The extra ft, as stated by me, is in these
wordsâ" 1) there is a danger of the pui/ic pa<t
vur.ts not being punctual, I submit whether it may
not be better, that the dijcentents winch would then
prije.jiould be transferredjrom a Court, of whcfr
good mil w have fomuct need, to the breajls or *
m ivate company."
Theftatement in the vindication represents,
that Mr. Jefferfon, Having stated the pro
fofition as abave (referring to the propofitiou
for the purchase of tiie debt) obfeives further
upon it, in its relation to this country, that if
/here be a danger our payments may net be puticlua/,
it might be belter, that the d'Jcontents ivktch would
then arije, fhcald be transferred from a court, of
XL'kofegoed will we hnefo much need, to the breafis
fff aptivate company."
All tiie material and exceptionable phrases
are the fame in the two statementsâThe on
fydm, f s ffet in 1.-ff
Mr. Jefferlbn is made to fuimit in the mode*
formofa "whether it might not be better."
the identicalfenti.r.ent or advice, which, in the
lalt, he is made to convey in the affirmative
tone of an observation, that " it might be bet
ter"âThe la ft mode of expression is certainlv
stronger than the firft, and if the feiitiniant
conveyed be, as it undoubtedly is, an impro.
per one, the censure due to it is entreated by
the greater degree ofdeciiion with which it
is exprefied, as being an indication of a more
decided state of mind concerning itâThis re
mark, which might otherwise appear nice and
critical, is naturally drawn forth by the at
tempt to have it undo/flood, that the words
" I fuimit whether," which are said to have
been interpolated, have an influence upon the
sense of the clause injurious to Mr. jefferlbn.*
The result i". that the alteration of terms
said to have been mad#, if real, inuft hare
been casual, because ic either does not vary
the sense, or varies it favorably to Mr. Jfcf
ferfon and confequentlv that the charge
which has been brought, rests upon him in its
primitive force, unmitigated by the alledged
change of terms.
In like manner admitting the statement of
whafc-is said to follow as a part of the fame
paragraph, to be truly represented in the vin
dicationâit either corresponds with the view
I have heretofore given of the matter, or it
implicates Mr.Jefferfbn in greater reprehenfi
bility than lias been yet charged upon himâlt
either presents an alternative proportion pre
dicated upon the supposition of a Jlate of things
differentf rom that which is the basis of the fir ft,
namely, the danger of a deficiency of means
for pundlual payment, and in that cafe does
not derogate from the firft or proceeding
upon the supposition of the fame [late of things,
it contains advice to Congress to avail them
fclves of the yet found state of their credit in
Holland, treacherously to induce individuals
upon the invitation of the government to lend
their money on the ordinary terms, for the pur
pose of making full payment to France, in
order to guard her from loss, and preserve
her confidence, in direst contemplation of not
being able to render the stipulated justice to
those individuals. If this was the advice of
Mr.Jefferfon,it leaves his condufl without e
ven chose flight extenuations which have been
supposed to afford a semblance of apology.
It takes away the feeble pretexts deduced
from the offer having originated with the
Company, and from their gaining a considera
ble boon in the firft purchase.
The last, I acknowledge, is the construc
tion best warranted by the ftrudhire of the pa
ragraph as delineated in the vindication.â
This, as it there Hands,would be the most ob
vious and natural reading.âlf there be a
danger that our payments may not be punc
tual, it may be better that the dificontents
which would then arise (houJd be transferred
from a Court of whose good will we have J"o
much need to the breasts of a private compa-
ny. But still it has occurred to me that we
may do what is preferable to accepting the
proposition of" the Dutch Company. VV - J may
find occafton to do what wouid be grateful to
the Court of France, and establish with them
a confidence in our honor. Our credit is good
in Hollandâ .:ay it not be poflible then to
borrow there the four and twenty millions
due to Franc?, and pay them the n-hole debt at
once. This, belides transferring the d.fcon
tents, to be fexpefted from the want of punc
tual payments, from the Court of France, to
the breads of individuals would ha\e the fur-
ther advantage of laving that court from any
loss on our account. It is in this sense only,
that the firft suggestion can be considered as
over-ruled bv, or absorbed in the lad, and
that Mr. Jefferfon can be said to have dis
countenanced the proportion made by the
Dutch Company. If tins be the meaning in
* The zvords u might not be better," are also
said to have been interpolatedâthough all but the
not" are in the quotation made by the Vindi
cator ) a ffecjmen of his accuracy.

tended to be contended for, no pains will be
taken to dispute it j and the comment will be
left to Mr. Jetfcrlon's molt partial admirers.
â¢ rT Wl 'lter.of the vindication continues to
inlift,that Mr.Jefferfon was only the vehicle of
communication, afligning as reasons for this
afiei tion that the tranfaftion had taken place
between t!ie parties, before any mention was
made ot it to him, and that in communicat
ing it to Congress he only made known to that
f body the desire both of the company and of th e
'rench Court ; That the opimon which he gave
rose out ef the proportion, aim in furthering of the
views oj tt.t parties, and that in fact no ilea [ton
fould be formed on it, either by the Congress
or himfeif, without a comparifun of the par
ties as creditors of the United States. But
these reasons do not prove ihat Mr. Jeflerfon
was onlv the vehicle of communication ; they
prove thÂ« contrary ; that he was both the ve
hicle of communication, and the patron, though
iiot the author of the proportion. The precise
difference betweeu being the mere vehicle, and
heiii" both the vehicle and the patron of a propo
rtion coniifts in this ; that in the tirfi cafe
thÂ» rtaci.iwthing mo-" cÂ«rJ;->ani
pi'wpofitionâin the lait he gives an o
frnion arijinv out of it; in furtherance of the views
of the proposers; which is exactly, what is ac
knowledged to have been done byMr.Jeflerfon.
The plea that there could be no immorality
or indelicacy, in efpoultng a proposition coming
from the parties interested, amounts to no
thing. Tbe charge is not, that advice was
given to accede to the proposition ; but that
advice was given to accede to it upon a ground
whick was dijhonorable and unjujl. It is the con
dition upon which tile acceptance is advised,
that constitutes the culpability.
In No. 4 of the vindication, the attack up
on Mr.Jeflerfon is said to proceed {ram private
revenge. In No. sit changes its nature, aid
becomes an attack upon printiples ; a monarchi
cal plot against the republican character of tbe
community. How long, and how often are
the people of America to beinfulted with this
hypocritical rant ? When will these political
phapifees learn, that their countrymen have
too much dHcernment to be the dupes of their
holtjtw andoftentatious pretentions ? Tliat the
citizens of the United States know how to
tliftUjgaifli the men wtio fervt theirs, fucntt
thofd to ho only flatter them, the men who
have substantial claims to their confidence,
from those who study to conceal the want of
qualities, really solid and uleful, under the
malic of extraordinary and exclusive patriot
ism and purity ?
It is curious to observe the pathetic wail
ings which have been produced by the an'u
madverfions in these papers. It would seem
as if a certain party considered themselves as
the sole and rightful censors of* the Republic ;
and every attempt to bestow praise or blame
not originating with them, as an usurpation
of their prerogative, every ftri&ure on any of
their immaculate band as a { bieach of their
privilege. They appear to think themselves
authorized to deal out anathemas, without
measure, or mercy, against all who dare to
swerve from their standard of political ortho
doxy, which are to be borne without retali
ation or murmur. And if any symptom of
either lliews itfelf, they are sure to raise the
dilmal cry of persecution ; themselves the
firft to a flail, and the firil to complain. But
what is not permitted to men who have so
clearly established a title, little less than di
vine, to a monopoly of ali the patriotic vir
tues !
The onlyanfwer, which is due to the feint
of offering to enter into arrangements, for
ascertaining whether the writer of thele pa
pers has in the instance under coniideratton
been guilty of milreprefentationâand the
breach of an official dutyâis to remind the
public that in my firlt paper I declared my
felf willing to be known on proper terms to
tlie officer concerned. To this I adhere, in
the spirit of the original intimation, but I
deem a personal disclosure to any subaltern
of his, improper ; nor do I perceive that it is
in the present cafe necelTary to an investiga
tion of fadts. The writer of the vindica
tion admits in fubllance what is aliedged, and
as to his collateral statements, it has been
shewn that they imply more blame on the
character meant to be exculpated, than was
originally charged. I forbear any comment
on the ii decency of naming upon conje&ure
the peri on who has been named as the author
of the e papers, or upon the palpable artifice
of nviking an avowal of them, by that parti
cular jjc'i son, the condition of a disclosure of
the name of the writer of the vindication.â
Indecency and artifice are the proper wea
pons of such adversaries.

Mr. Russeli,
IN Mr. Kreneau's National Gazette,
there is an indirect, but lufiici
ently intelligible infitiuatioÃ, that
the old republican fpiric of Ameri
ca, has been rather obfmred for
some time palt in the Ncvi-Enpland
States.
The persons throughout the uni
on who liill feel and reverence the
old republican spirit are not a few.
âIt is evidently the delign of the
writer of the paragraph alluded to,
to create a jealousy against the New-
England principles, and, to effect
that, it is endeavored to ftigniatife
them as anti-republican.
Polfibly local prejudices, (which
alas ! are not quite dead, though
dying,) may alfift the currency of
this infinuatiou, and parties without
believing may not blufli to afFec't to
believe it. Therefore some nntice
of the slander seems properfrom cit -
cumrtances, though none is due to
it from its weight. Such as examine
afiertions with care may be easily
convinced, and such as do not, ate
not worth the convincing.
Men of inqniry will search for the
anti-republican spirit of the New-
England dates in their constitutions
and laws, their institutions, or their
manners and cuftgms. If this evil
spirit should not appear in auy of
these, where does it lurk ? This is
bed known to the malignant para
graph-writer who ltigmatifes a dif
trift of country containing more
than a million of people, all free.
Anti-republican principles mult
be supposed to intend such as are
oppolite to a jlift equality of rights
and of power.

The iiiftitutions and political ha
bits of New-England do not evince
a monopoly of power and rights by
the few again It the many. I here
was a time in 1774 and 1775, when
the whole people of New-England
fpoke,-through their town-meetings,
the language of determined riefilt
ance to tyranny. Then it appeared
to the whole continent, that the
town corporations in the eastern co
lonies wete so many orderly repub
lics, admirably adapted to the pre
firvation of equal liberty, because
they served to collect, to mature,
and to give a momentum to the fen
timentsof the peopleâand not less
adapted to maintain good order even
after the'authority of the lawsceaf
ecl. In faifi, they flood for a time
indead of laws and government,and
during the whole war eminently af
filed the dates in the druggie. Yet
this didri<ft of country, though fill
ed with petty republics which actu
ally reduce republican principles to
practice, and make them familiar
to the multitude, is pretended by a
writer, who probably never saw it,
to have declined from its republi
canism.
Is there in the general state of
New-England manners, any thing
to warrant this infinoation ? The
tenure of lands is in fee limpleâ
lease eftatcs are almost unknown.
Small, but independent freeholds,
form infinitely the greatest propor
tion of property and influence. A
foil, too rugged for any but free
hands to til], is found on number
]efs|trials, unprofitable when en
grofl'ed into great plantations. It
must therefore remain in the hands
of a numerous yeoinaury. These
are their rights, and the world has
seen with what an high spirited con
sciousness of their worth the New-
England farmers have defended
them. Are these the men, who not
only nnderftand but who feel their
rights, with whom the republican
spirit is obscured ? It is true their
habits are favorable to order they
enjoy too much to desire the over
throw of a government which pro
tects their rights, and extends their
happiness. But without meaning
to charge sentiments unfriendly tn
republican liberty upon the people
of the fuuthern states, New-En<rland
may vouch her constitutions" and
laws, her political habitg and insti
tutions, and the general state of pro
perty, manners and society, as well
as the recent events of the revoluti
on, to prove that the ardor of her
zeal is not abating, and is not infe
rior to their own.

Mr. Thomas Paine, after a of three
hours, arrived here from Dover. The
di erent treatment he met with at the two sea
ports, is such as ought to make an Eugiilhman

ficer on guard having embraced him, presented
him with the national cockade. A very pretty
woman, who stood by, dtfn ed she mi zlu have
the honor of putting it on hÂ»s hat, exprefling her
hopes that he would continue his exertions in
favor of Liberty, Equality, and France. This
ceremony being over, he walked to D'cflcin's,
(whose ftrect is now called Rue dcl'Egalit*, for
merly Rue du Roi) atttended by men, women
and children, crowding round him, and calling
out. 11 Vits Thomas Paine !" He was then con
duced to,l he town hall, and there prefenitd tp
the Municipality, who, with the greatest affac
non, embraced their new Reprefcntative. The
Mayor then addrefled him in a (hort speech,
which was interpreted to him by Mr. Audibert,
to which Mi. Paine (laying his hand on his
heart) replied, faying, his life frould be devoted
to their service.
At the inn he was waited upon by the dif
ferent persons in authority, and by the Piefidrnt
of the Constitutional Society, desiring lie would
attend their meeting of that night. The whole
towu would hjVe been there had there been
room ; the hall of the ' Minirnej' was so crowd
ed, that it was with difficulty they made way
for him to the fide of the President. Over the
chair he fat in was placed the bust of Mirabeau,
and the colours of prince, England a-nd Ame

the tribune, of his elefticn, ainidll (he plaudits

extra meeting in thechutch to-morrow, m honor
of their Deputy to the Convention, the Minima
being found quite lutfocating,from the concoui fe
of people who attended yellerdav. To-night
there is to be a play, at which a box is to be re

Extract of a letter from Brigadier Gene
ral Wilkinfon, to tbe Secretary at War,
dated at Fort Hamilton, 6th Novem-
ber, 1792, 7 o'clock P. M.
" Just as I was about to dispatch this,
I icccived a letter from Major Adair,
commandant of the Kentucky mounted
infantry, of which the enclosed is a copy:
The check which the enemy experienced
in this little affair, will produce good ef
fects, and the event refle&s honour upon
the major and the yeomanry of Kentucky;
but the immediate consequence will be an
entire stop to the transport of forage to
the advanced post, as our pack horses ate
either destroyed or disabled, and the rifle
men dismounted. In this situation, lam
perplexed by difficulties, as from try ig
norance of the designs of government,and
for the want of explicit orders, I am at a
loss whether todirea the purchase of more
pack hoifes, or to encourage the riflemen
to remount themselves. On these points
I lliall duly dehberate, and will make such
decision as my judgment may dired, re.
lying confidently on the liberality of go
vernment, for an excuse, (hould I err; and
in the mean time, I shall urge forward the
transport of forage from Furt Waftiing
*Â°n to tins post, by every means left in my
power.

As tills affair happened near to and in
fight of Fort St. Clair it may be enquired
why the commanding officer did not sup
port major Adair ? The answer is ftiort,
and will, I hope, prove fatisfaCtory-"The
gavrifon under his command is posted for
defence, and not offence, and altho' it ap
pears that in this initance to have hazard
ed would have been judicious, yet as 1
have considered it fafeft for the national
intÂ«reftsto confine my subordinate officers
by rigidorderstodtfenfive measures solely,
they are bound to hazard in no cafe what
evci, does not immediately and es
sentially interest the faftty of the trust
.which may be confided to them ; and it
may be added that in the instance before
up, the attack, was a raoft daring one,
neither the number or ultimate
obje&of the enemy, could be developed,
before it was discovered that Major Adair
was a full match for him.
I have this moment dispatched twenty
tif my mounted infantry, who will reach
St. Clair before day light, to aid in
bringing in the wounded and the weary.
Copy of a letter from Major John Adair,
to JSrigadier General Wilkinfon, dated
Fort St. Clair, November 6, 1792.
S 1 R,
This morning about the firft appear
ance of day, the enemy attacked my
camp, within fight of this post, the at
tafekwae sudden, and thejenemy came on
â¢â¢with a degree of courage that bespoke
them warriors indeed, foroe of my men
were h#nd in hand'with -them before we.
retreated, which however we did about
eighty yard# to a kind of stockade intend
ed for stables ; we there made a Hand, I
then ordered Lieut. Madison to take a
party and gain their right flank if poflible,
I called for Lieut. Hail to fend to the
left; but found he had been flatn ; I then
led forward the fnen who stood near me,
which together with the ensigns Bucha
nan and Flinn, amounted to about twen
ty-five, and pressed the left of their center
thinking it absolutely necessary to afiift
Madison. We made a manly pu(h, and
the enemy retreated, taking all our hor
se( except five or fix. We drove them a
bont fix hundred yaids through our camp,
, where they again made a (land, and we
fought them some time, two of my men
were here (hot dead.
At that moment I received informati
on that the enemy was about to flank us
on the right, and on turning that way, I
saw about 60 of them running to that
point. I had yet heard nothing of Ma
dison I then ordered my men to retreat,
which they did with deliberation, hearti
ly cursing the Indians who pursued us
close to our camp, where we again fought
them until they gave way ; and when
they retreated our ammunition was near
ly expended altho' we had been supplied
from the gariifon in the course of the
action. I did not think proper to follow
them again, but ordered my men into the
garrison to draw ammunition. I return
ed however, in a few minutes to a hill,
to which we had firftdiiven them, where
I found two of m.y .men fcalpcd, who
were bro't in. SioCW-tl began to write
this, a few of the etdPtoy appeared in
fight, and I pursued them with a party
about a quarter of a mile, but could not
overtake ihem, and did not think proper
to go farther. Madison, who I sent to
the right, was on his firft attack wound
ed, and obliged to retreat to the garrison,
leaving a man or two dead.
To this misfortune I think the enemy
are indebted for the horses they have got;
had he gained their right flank, I once
had pofleffion of their left, and I think
we (hould hare routed them at that stage
gf the action, as we had them on the re
treat. I have fix killed and five wound
ed ; four men are miffing, [ think they
went off early in the action on horseback,
and are, I suppose, by this, -at Fort Ha
milton. My officers and a number of
men diftinguiffied themselves greatly.â
Poor Hail died calling to his men to ad
vance. Madifon'a bravery and conduct
need no comment; they are well known.
Flinn and Buchanan acled with a cool
ness and courage which dots them much
honor. Buchanan, after firing his gun,
knocked down an Indian with the barrel.
1 hey have killed and taken a great num
ber of the pack-horfeg. I intend follow
ing them this evening some distance, to
ascertain their route and strength, if pof-
I IÂ»i i>.{ V {..v. 1
fible,
bout fifty of n;v men fought with a bra
very equal to any men in the world, and
had not the
on bee
as a
place of fafety for the bafhful, I think
many more would have fought well.
The enemy have no doubt as many kil
led as myfelf; they left two dead on the
ground, and I saw two carried ess. The
only advantage they have gained is our
horses, which is a capital one, as it disa
bles me from bringing the inteiview to a
more serious and fatiafaftory decision. I
am foriy I cannot fend you belter news,
and am, fir, yours, &c.

DEAR SIR,

the Tieceflity of making feme further' provision

you will pay a cheerful attention to thisr fubjeÂ£U
I (hall only, therefore, observe, thdl the proposed

out incurring the expencc of a new building,
either by enlarging that which Congress now

of the General Government,the State-House and

A letter was read from the Secretary of War,
aommunicatiag, pursuant to orders from the
iprefident of the United States, dispatches from
Brigadier General Wilkini'on, containing an ac
count of a recent attack from a party of Weft
,crn Indians, on an encampment of American
troops under the command ot Major Adair, near
Fort St. Clair, in which the Indians were repulf
cd âand a letter from James Seagrove, Super
intendant of Indian affairs to the Creek nation,
giving an account of a favorable termination to
a treaty or interview held with the Chiefs ot
that nation.
Ivlr. Sedgwick called up his motion, laid on
the table yesterday, for discharging the commit
tee of the whole on that part of the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury which relates to
reimbursing the loan made of the Eank of the
United States, and to appoint a fele& commit
tee who should report a bill making provision
in the cafe.
This motion was agreed to, and a committee
confiding of Messrs. Sedgwick, Lawrance and
Murray, were appointed.
In committee of the whole on the bill to regu
late trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes.
Mr, Dayton in the chair.
1 He "bill was read through, and then eonfi
dered by paragraphs. Sundry amendments were
made. The committee proceeded through the
discussion ; they then role and reported the bill
with those amendments, which were laid on the
tabic, and the house adjourned.
THURSDAY, Dec. 20.
A Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on
the petition of LudwicKuhn, was read. This
re. ort was against the prayer of the petition.
Mr. Murray presented a memorial of sundry
of the Officers of the late Maryland line of the
Army, in behalf of themselves and the privates
of tht fa id army. The objeA of this memorial
is iinidar to those from the Officers of the Penn
sylvania and New-York lines, whieh is, compen
fition for tl:e depreciation and loss fuflained by
them 0:1 t! - certificates received for their fervi
a . This menforial was read and laid on the
tubl., with the others.
t. Steele laid a resolution on the table, to
the foilv>win.- purport, viz.
Twut lrv.irtee be appointed to prepare and
brin; '1 io reduce the military eftablifti-
.t jd'States""to
liietn
or corj.. , iingeachof non-com
mi (lion ed 0. ;srs,privates and iÂ®nficians, with
such proportion of comtfiij/Loiied officers as the
President may tnmk proper to continue infer
vice.âAnd to repeal so much of an a<st palled
the sth Marc!?, 1792, entitled, "An ast for
making further a;:d more etfrftual provifiun
for the protection of the Frontiers of the
United Stater," as may contravene this in
tention.
This motion, Mr. Steele said, he was influen
ced to bring forward, from two motives. The
firfl was to afford more effectual protection to
the frontier?âthe other was, that by this reduc
tion a sum of money might be drawn from the
War Department, to be applied to the reduction
of the public deht, so that a necefiity for new
taxes, to that objeii, may be fupercedeci.
The fele& committee, to whom the coasting
|>ill had been re-committed, reported sundry a-
Aendments, which were taken into eonfidera
tion by the House, and all of them agreed to.
Mr. Clark objected to a clause in the I 2th
fe&ion, which enjoins that every change of
the matter of every packet or ferry-boat, shall
be reported at the custom-house the firtt oppor
tunity. Mr. Dayton stated the inconveniencies
to which the matters and owners of the small
copfting craft and packet boats belonging to the
ttate ofNew-Jerfey would be particularly expo
sed by this injunction, where the mailers are
very frequently changed. To remove this ob
je&ion Mr. Goodhue proposed to insert thele
words, ferry-beats excepted. This motion wai
adopted.
It was then ordered that the bill be engrofled
for a third reading.
The amendments reported by the committee
of the whole to the bill to regulate trade and in
tercourse with the Indian tribes were taken into
consideration.
Objections were made to the fifth fe<sKon,
which contemplates legiftating, and punilhing
crimes committed within the boundaries of the
Indian countriesâit was contended that the ca-
mentioned were fully provided for by trea
ties, or by the laws of the refpe&ive states; the
whole ground, it was said, is covered by these
provitions; and therefore there appears an im
propriety, if not an absurdity, in ena&ing, in a
Jubfequent law, that certain punishments lhall
be infli&ed for certain crimes, which are fufiici
ently recognized by the several treaties already
formed ; that the attempt would operate unjust
ly, the provifious may reach our own citizens,
but cannot affedt so fully as they ought the Sa
vages. It was moved that the whole fe&ion
ihould be struck out.
Inoppofition to this motion,it was said, that
the power of the general government to legis
late in all the territory belonging to the Urnon,
not within the limits of any particular Hate, can
not be doubted : if the government cannot
Wiakc laws to refuain perfens fioni going out cf
the limits of any of the state?, and commit mur
ders and depredations, it would be 111 vain to
expeil any peace with the Indian tribes. The
power ol Cougrefs to legislate, independent of
treaties, it wa: also said, must be admitted for
it is impossible, that every cafe Ihould be provid
ed for by thofc treaties.
The question being called for, Mr. Glarl; rose
and observed, that he conceived it "w as of im
portance that the house Ihould vote with th.'ir
eyes open; and to enable them to do this, he
said he Ihoultl read the ordinance of the late
Congreft pasTed in 1787, refpe&ing the fettle
nient of the wtillem country. He observed that
he believed very few of the members had turned
their attention to it. He accordingly read fueh
parts of the ordinance as'he thought essential to
the point, which was to (hew that the clause of
the bill now toiler consideration, would is it.
operation violate the solemn ftipulatiom with
the settlers contained in the ordinance, as full
provision is contained in the ordinance to insti
tute all civil and criminal proccfTes.-The motion
for striking oui ihe fe&ion was negatived. The
amendments of the committee of the whole were
agreed to with some amendments.âVarious i'ub
fequent amendments were moved with various
success, some being agreed to and others reject
ed. Without fimihing the diicuilion of the bill
the house adjourned

William Maekay, tor second readingâi 6 was

Mr. HeKter and Mr. Moore were appoint

COMMUNICATIONS.
There are some of our party writers who
appear to have veryjhort memoriesâthe men
in Congress who have formed the majority on
all the great questions, are called Jpccu<'ator'iâ
but these writers forget that these .'peculators
have repeatedly received the luffrages of the
people; they forget that all their slanderous
epithets bellowed on the majority of both
houses of Congress, and on the adminiflxation,
headed by the President of the United States,
fall ultimately on the people ; they forget that
while they pretend to be republicans, and yet
revile the organs of the public-will, they ex
pose the most detestable of ariftocratical sen
timents ; they forget, that while they pisfefs
to be superior to the influence of avarice, by
maligning those who poflefs more property
than themfelVcj,' they discover more than one
bad passionâEnvy and Avarice united ; in
short, they Jorget that, this one opinion is
deeply rooted in the mind of every confident
republican âThat the leader: of parties, ar?
in general, Tyrants in disposition.
The National Gazette gives us to under
stand that the mate to a party, is loft in the
late contest for the office of Vice-Prefident.â
The fact is agreed, and it is not hard to fuel's
who the losers are. A mate is certainly a
convenient thin? and contributes not a little
to the free enjoyment of liberty of speech.â
For instance, how could anv man without a
mate fay Governor Clinton is a good federal,
ift, and on that account to be preferred to
JMr. Adams. If a p ; vfician should iccoin
mend ratsbane to a sick man he would have
need of a mate. A man that has occasion
to SayâDo not trull the conftitutior to its
friend-, its enemies will serve our turn
better, would find his utterance greatly aflift
ed by a mate ; But if his argument fliould
take another turn he might get along without
a mate. There is for example, no propri
ety in uiing any difgui'e when a man would
infill that the bodv politic is a monster, and it
is proper to cut off an arm or a leg or even
an head, if it has more than oneâor that it is
lethargic and a little rats-bane would give
the nerves a gentle twinge. That would be
speaking out plainly and with a becoming
boldnefsTâThey might even go farther and
urge that for such an operation on the Confli
tnt'ion no friend or admirer of it would be a
fai'e performer or surgeon. A fal'e tender
ness might prevent the proper i ,-:afures of
decision. Where then was the u.-fitnefs in
r this known desperate ftatc- of the constitu
tion in turnin.s our eyes to one who could be
relied on to do the needfulâwho like Hanni
bal has vowed eternal hatred to Rome, and
who is of a tern; i that neither time nor con
descension can change.

These i-dolater*, itfeenis, are in amhulh
for an oppoiuinity to throw down and dcltrov
1 heir own idol, ai>d to commit wliat *hey derm
facnlegeÂ»-WhilÂ« the unbelieving .eim's, who
lay that <his id>4 is not divine, but men; wood
and ctay, arc -{hacked at die very Thought of this
intended impiety. It is to be hoped inr the
fdke of our country, that its frame ol govtro
men: it betier put together than this fiory.
There is perhaps do opinion in which mankind
are more generally agreed than this, that know
ledge and virtue arc the only durable basis of a
free government. An ignorant and ferociou*
people, irom a strong sense of perlonal or gen
era! injury, w$ often be induced to roufc from
a stupid apathy under the power of despotism,
and in a paroxysm of their frenzy may hur
their opprefifors to perditionâbut like men in a
storm who have thrown their compass overboard
after effecting the deftrusjon ol their oppreflors
they are perfectly at a losÂ» what course to (leer
next â s he consequence has been, almost invaria
bly, that thole who have diftinguiihed them
selves the most in the work of deftru<stion, how
ever incompetent to contrive a system for the
security of the freedom thus acquired, are vested
with powers, which theyfeldom fail to exercise
for their own particular advantage, and in the
end establish a worse despotism than the people
have just demoliihed.âThefe reflexions may
enable us to account for the nnhappy issue of ma
ny revolutions which have taken place in
the world â Ignorance can destroy what is bad,
but it can never effetf what is good.
The general light and information of the peo
ple oi the United States enabled them justly to
estimate the privileges they enjoyed previous to
the late revolutionâthese made them alive to
every attempt oc the part of Great Britain to
abridge and deilroy those privileges. The pa-,
triota and" lV~es of our country let .before the
people life and death, blefling and curlingâbut
their labours would have been in vain, their
writings a dead letter, if the public mind had
not been properly prepared to receive and justly
to appreciate the words of truth and found rea
soning had the people been ignorant, they
would never have conquered their local prejudi
ces, their almost inveterate habits, and by a An
gular magnanimity, which nothing butfuperior
wisdom could have inspired, have formed that
bond of union, which proved the rock of their
fafety, enabled them to brave the ft or me that
beat against their freedom, and finally carried
them to independence, peace, liberty and fafct).
On knowledge and virtue then are taifed the
pillars of this rising republicâthese mull i'up
port the edificeâand it is the firft of legislative
duties to make provision to encreafe, as our num
bers encreafe, and to perpetuate the means of
knowledge among the people; and he is unwor
thy the name of patriot, let his pre tendons be
what they will, whodifcovers a luke-warmnef*
on this lubje&.âlt ought to be a perpetual ob
jed; of attention to our civil fathersâand till
the business is began in earned there will remain
a most unpardonable deficiency in the dilchurge
of legislative duty âLet a beginning be made,
if it is on the fmaliell scale it will be a begin
ningâand the feed once sown it will take root;
the bleflingsof knowledge once enjoyed, become
asneceffary to human happinefsas the light and
heat of the fun are to human existence.

BOSTON, Dec. 8
On Wednesday evening last, by
virtue of a warrant iflued by Jul
tices Greenltfaf and Barrett, on the
complaint of the Attorney-General,
the Sheriff of this county arretted
Mr. Harper, one of the company of
Comedians who for fomeftime past
ha*e entertained the inhabitants of
this town, as guilty of a breach of
the law against Theatrical enter
tainmentsâand held him to bail to
appear the next day before the Jus
tices, and recognize for his appear
ance at the next Supreme Judicial
Court. At the end of the second
aÂ«ft of the " School for Scandal"
which was then performing, Mr.
Harper came forward on the stage,
and read a card from the Iheriff,
informing Mr. Harper, that unless
the performances of the evening
were flopped, he should apprehend
forthwith all the persons of the
company. Much agitation ensued,
and the resentment of the citizens
at what they conceived to Vie a vio
lent and untimely nieafure, t!Hoo
vered itlelf in several spirited pro
ceedings, and a loud call for the
performances to go on : Bnt, at the
particular requelt of the perform
ers, the audience dispensed with the
entertainment of the evening, and
peaceably retired ; firft refilling to
accept the admifliÃii money, Mr. H.
offered to return.
The next clay, Mr. Harper appear
ed before the juflices to recognize.
The coutt, for the gratification of
the citizens, was held in Faneuil-
Hallâwhen the Attorney-General
read a special order from the Su
preme Executive, direi'ting him to
make tlie complaint on which the
warrant was iilued, and then read
the complaint. On Mr. H. being
put to plead, Mr. Otis, one of his
counsel, objeded to the legality of
the warrant as contrary to the 14th
article of the Declaration ofÃights,
which requires, that no warrant
lhall be illued, except upon com
plaints made upon oath : anet- the
complaint upon which the present
warrant was illued not being made
upon oath, the warrant con fee 11 e 111-
ly was illegal. Mr. Tudor, the o
ther counsel for Mr. Harper, fup
poited Mr. Otis's opinionâwhich
was combated by the Attorney-Ge
neral with imich candor and fair
nefs. Ihe opinion of their honors
being desired, one of them (Mr.
Barret) acceded to the validity of
the defendant's counsel. âIn confe
quei.ee of which Mr. Harper was
liberated, much to the fatisfaiftion
of a numerous and resectable au
uience.
