A NAHON4L PAPER, PUBLISHER WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 34, NORTH FIFTH.STREET, PHI LADE J. PHIA
[No. 82 of Vol. IV.]
CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, March I.
in committee of the whole, Mr. Muhlenberg
' jn the chair, on the 3d, 4th, sth, 6th, 7th,
and Bth resolutions, refpefting the olfitia!
jarcduft of the Secretary of the Trealiiry,
far which fee 6azette of Wedneldav h.ft.
MR. BÂ»Rn wp L ,i.
BEFORE J proceed to discuss the j
observations which yesterday fell
-from the gentleman who introduced the
resolutions now before us, I cannot ie
frain from faying, that I am extiemely
happy, that in palling through the medi
um of that gentleman's examination, this
fubjeft has changed its hue from the foul
of peculation to the milder colouring
(tain illegal exercise of discretion and a
want of politeoefs in the Secretary of the
Treafttry. 1 fed happy hecaufe I always
am so when any man chaTged with guilt
can acquit himfelf; and the mote so
now, when a man in a high responsible
office, and high in the estimation of his
countrymen, can reduce a charge from a
.quality calculated to have excited an alarm
even in Pandemonium to such a shape as I
fancy will scarce f-rve to fatisfy the un
common curiosity which it appears to have
excited. As I have never been in the ha
bit of taking notes, I (hall depend upon
memory in answering the gentleman from
Virginia ; although I imagine as that gen
tleman usually (ticks very close in his
point, whatever it may be, that in pursu
ing his charges I (hall substantially an
swer his arguments. In commenting up
on the two tirlt resolutions to which I am
by order confined, I (hall consider in the
firft inltance, what regards the tight of
drawing monsy into tilia countryâthe j
gentleman appears not to have confidcred
the law properly, for tkere cannot be a
doubt that the President had a right to
make what arrangements he pleated in
order to attain what he might consider a
proper modification of the debt due by
thp United States abroad ; he might have
borrowed the money here or have paid
here; he might have borrowed the mo
ney in England, or wherever he thought
lit. I will a(k the gentleman by what pre
cise authority he borrowed the money in
Amlterdamand Antwerp, and paid it in
Paris ; certainly by none, but that discre
tion which has been depended upon to
modify the debt in the manner most pro
ductive to the interest of the United
States, I take it then for granted, Mr.
Chairman, that th; right of the President
to draw the money bqrro\ved here, or to
fend it any where must be conceded : The
question will then arise, whether the Se
cretary of the treasury had a right to do
this cir no, and whether thU-iias not been
done without, nay, againlt the in(l ructions
of the President. I really consider this
83 one of the mod extraordinary cases
that I have ever known exhibited. Let
us cpniidev its form, a highly important
wuftof no ltffer import than the discreti
onary use of 14,000,000 of dollars is pla
ced in the President of the United States.
jl,e by a general commifiion and by spe
cial instructions, deputes his power to the
Secretary of the treasury, dating that he
is to conform to tbefe and whatever in
tuitions he might from time to time
give him. Let any man seriously examine
thelis powers, and 1 am of opinion that the
Secretary under these had aright todraip
if he thought proper, unless inttrinfted to
the contrary : For the President conveys
a cempleat power to modify the debt,pro
vided that it (hall be with all convenient
dispatch applied to pay the principal and
interest <3ue to France } for where the
payments are to be made are certainly left
to the Secretary. If this has not been
exercised advantageously thib is another
circumltance which the gentleman him
felf has not questioned. But fays the getÂ»-
tleman, the Secretary under these instruc
tions had no special authority to draw,
notwithftciriding which he began to draw
ip 1790* 1"d has continued to diaw ax
Wednesday, March 15, 1793.
different times into the cnor
moui sum of 3,000,000 of drtllats, and
therefore he mntt have <J<*ne this without,
nay, again ft the inilm&ions of the Pieil
detK> who it is presumed having' delegat
ed this great trufthas newer for three years
inquired into the performance of it.
j Can this be the inference of common
ienfeâcan this ixe the inference of the ex
perience which we have had of the Presi
dent, one of the prominent features of
whose character always has been an induf
iry to wvelligate particulars, as remarka
ble as his sagacity :o frame generals. If
then tnfttafticms,have not been given or
have been exceeded, was it neceifcfy for
11s to come in aid of the Prefideut, he who
by ow law has the power which we our
tetoes cannot exercise of removing any of
the executive officers at pleasure ; it cer
tainly cannot be neceffaty, for as this offi
cer continues to ast, wa must conclude,
that he has either aÂ£ted by iriiuuiflioHs,
or in. fiich manner as to have given fatis
faition to his principal without them.â
Really, Mr. Chairman, I cannot fcilt be
lieve that if suspicion had not led thE'gen
tleman from Virginia astray, ths ufijal
correftnffs of his underltartding would
have prevented him from pursuing such an
ignifs futuus 33 this.
Thus Sir I think I have ftiewn that the
President of the United States certainly
had the authority to draw the furos t>m
rowed here, and that both under his co>m
miffion and his inftru&ions given, and in
evitably implied, the Secretary had also
this power, to do this. I (hall therefore
now proceed to a more special confidera
tioo of the firtt charge, that the Secreta
ry has violated the law in applying a por
tion of the principal borrowed to the pay
ment oF the TnterelE railing due upon that
principal, which was not authoiifed by
law.
Before I proceed, Mr. Chairman, I
would wish to remark, that whilll I consi
der no principle in legislation more cor
re&, than that no money (hall be drawn
from the Treasury but under appropria
tions by law ; yet I consider both as itn
pra&ible and mischievous the doctrine,
that the money arising from a special tax
(hall in no instance be used for any other
than that special purpose for which the
the Aims vaifed ought rather to be <;onii
deted as an aggregate fund applicable to
aggregate purposes, and indeed if a rigid
adherence 10 the precise letter of the law
is neceflary there. has been no occasion to
go abroad to feerch for violations; for
our government at home has been able to
atS only by this violation. Itis wcllknown
that the duties of impost and tonnage are
appropriated si.-si to produce the sum of
600,000 dollars for the civil lift, then to
pay the interest of the foreign debt and so
pn ; so that by q. rigid observance of this
law the secretary must have firft colle&ed
the 600,000 into the public coffers and
then a sum fufficient to pay the interest
of the foreign debt, a process which only
requires Hating to ihew its absurdity and
which must neverthelef9 have been connec
ted with a minute conltruAion of the law.
Indeed, Mr. Chairman, if theadls of com
mon life bear any analogy with public
management, which I believe, what could
be considered as being more extraordina
ry than that an individual (hould appro
priate the proceeds of one farm to pur
chase bread, of another drink, and to de
clare in the face of contingencies, that
happen what may, he would llarve (hould
the breed crop fail, rather than use the
surplus of that appropriated to purchase
drink, for its purchase. But to return,
what is this charge, a sum of money was
due abroad for the interest of 1791 and
1792, to be paid out of the domeltic re
venues of 179 1 and 1792; the United
States had an offer to make a payment in
part of what was due France, for which
money had been borrowed and wa9 alrea
dy on hand abroad, in a supply of provi
sions from here to the Island of St. Do
mingo, tbefrcretary therefore, aod doubt
325
l(:fÂ» with the corffent orfthe Prefjdetit, in
stead of transmitting either bills or money
from this country to Fiance, 111 order to
pay the interest due there, and bringing
the money borrowed to pay the French
debt into this country, in order to f jnifh
supplies for St. DomingÂ®, has committed
the great crime of diredting the money
borrowed and already upon the spot to be
applied to the payment of the interest due,
a-.d h.13 taken the sams applicable to the
payments of that interest which was al
ready here and made uÂ£e of it to pay the
debt due to France in the produce of the
United States. So that although appa
rently a portion of the principal bojrow
ei bus been applied to pay an interest due,
yet in reality its capacity to be thus used
arose from its constituting in thiu country
an equivalent fuin applicable, and which
haÂ» been applied to pay off the princrpal
of the French debt, the object fur which
the money vva.s furrowed. Let candour
iuyeftigate this tranfaftion and fare I am
its deductions will be direAiy the contra
ry of a charge of crimination, I (hall con
clude with cbferving, that I (hould have
proceeded to examine the other reloluti
ons which I conlider cs weak as those I
have made fhorl comments upon, were I
not retrained by the rules of the houfc.
But this I will venture to fay, that they
will be proved unfounded in their investi
gation, and will merit the witty obfetva
tipft of a celebrated wi iter, that though
ihcy rose like a rocket, they will fall like
the stick.
Mr. Findley next rose and exprefled
l/imfclf nearly at, follows:
Mr. Chairman, being strongly impref
;cd with the importance of oiw time which
is now lo near an end, though I had the
fcOnunr of fcumidiug thtr rcfeinticÂ»Â»j-1-
took no part in the debates of yelterday ;
nor will I now detain you with replies to
many of the arguments which have been
offered againll the resolution now under
dUctiflior).
Upon one argument, frequently intro
ducetl by the gentleman lad up, viz. the
greatness of the Secretary's ehara&er, See.
I will only make a Tingle remark ; there
ia no chara&cr officially known in the ex
ecutive departments of this government
who merits pre-eminence, or to whom a
degree of greatness can be aferibed, but
in proportion to his prompt execution of
the laws and the attention with which he
dilcharges the duties of his office. From
this rule the President himfelf is not ex
empted, much less a subordinate Secreta
, rjrÂ» B'hofe appointment is. during pleasure,
and the duties assigned him of a changea
ble and temporary nature.
But to come to the rtfo'ution before
WÂ»; the firit enquiries chat offer them
fcives arc, whether the money in question
was appropriated to special and diftindi
puipofes? I>id the Secietaiy of the trea
sury apply the money to other life* than
the law dire died ?
in answer to the firft it is only necessa
ry to advert to the law authorising the
loans. The law authorising the twelve
million loan, appropriates whatever amount
may be borrowed foMy to the payment of
debts then due to France and Holland.
The. law authorising the two- million
loan directs the application thereof to the
redemption of the domestic debt, in aid of
about dollars arifiug from the reve
nue previous to the firftof January.
These appropriations were precise, dif
tiniS ami unconditional, with refpedt to
the ufeÃ no room was left for the exercise
of discretion ; the will of ihs legiilature
was- esprefs aud clearly defigtied, it left
no rouin for evalion nor any excuft for
miftakc ; nor did the President transfer to
the Secretary any other authority or in
duction than what the law exptefied.
But the gentleman from South-Caro
lina fayÂ», that preemption is, thasttli
the President did give other inftru&ions
tha* lie ha* that in this
cafe pcefumption (hould be admitted as
coftclufivc testimony ; aud'that the Secre
[Whole No. 404.
tary nor the PreficJent are not obliged tiÂ»
communicate theinllrttclion or authorise*
to 11s.
The gentleman is Â» lawyer, I will ap
peal to himfelf, I will appeal to ail the
profeffi jHBI members on the floor, whe
ther presumption can be admitted as proof
where in the nature of the cÂ»fe pofttive
tsfiimony can be procured.
Surely in courts of justice pufitire fef.
timony is always required, and prefurap
tive is rarely admitted ; but in this cafe
the presumptive is by the gentleman set
in oppofitiun to the positive. However
this is not the cafe in faÂ£h The President
did give cortimiffion and inftru&ions, and
these arc fully communicated to us. If ha
conceived irtt had no right to demand
them, he would have told U9 so j if he
had kept any part of them back, he would
have informed us, and nffijxoed his reasonÂ»
or doing so. I prefnme that the President
has a&ed the part of a canrli i honest man $
the gentleman picfumes the revtfrfe,
fuggt'ftion that this honfe, which has the
exclusive right of originating the appro
priation of money, has no tigh( to be in
formed of th< application of it, is so no
vel and extraordinary, so inconfrllent with
propriety and good government, that it
requires no reply.
Did the Secretary apply the money
borrowed in Europe agreeably to the le
gal appropriations of the Prescient? No he
did not, though some of the gentlemen
do not acknowledge this ; yet the Secre
tary has clearly acknowledged it himfeif,
and has filled his reports with laboured
and ingenious apologies for so doing ; he
has fuggelled a variety of motives, and
taken, infinite liberty to charm (is
with the mighty public advantages re
fulling from hie doing so. He acknow
ledges having drawn to this country and
applied in Europe to uses for which other
monies were appropriated, jmillfons of dol
lars ; out of this he has paid upwards of
400,000 dolls, of the French debt to St.
Domingo. I did not complain of paying
the interest due in Europe out of the mo
ney obtained there : The gentlemen ap
ply the force of their arguments with
great attention to support or apologize:
for this part of the Secretary's conduit,
as if against this only the charge in the re
folutton lay. But we do not object to ap
plying that money- in Holland, which
ought to have been brought here, if the
money which according to the appropria
tion should have gone to Holland had
been put to the life here for which the o
ther was intended, a simple eschange of
money for the purpose of eonveniency Se
(Bconomy ii properly one of these cases to
which ministerial discretion may solely be
extended ; but the qneftiort is, whether
the money has been replaced. The amount
of moiroy has not been applied-to the uses
intended, confeqjiently the appropriation
has been, disregarded. It is acknowfed'g.
Ed that though there were upwards of
1,300,000 dolls, of the d'omeflic (inking
fund, and upwards of 2,300,000 dbllan
drawn from Europe, be-fides the monies
applied to the relief of St. Domingo, and
yet when these enquiries began, there was
not 1,000,000 dollars applied to the re
demption of the public debt, and even ytt
the whole of the domestic appropriation
has not been applied to the finking fund,
notwithstanding that the public debt now
is and has for sometime been under par.
We have it on record, that the Secretary
Bever informed the commissioners of
draughts He made on Europe, although
the fund was exclufivcly to be at their dif
pofftt.
However I will not detain the commit
tee with minute ftntements, they are not
neceflary ; the Secretaty has acknowledg
ed that he drew more money from Eli-,
rope than the l*w awthorifed him to do :
that he was influenced todo so by motives
not contemplated in the law, and had ei
ther applied it or drawn it fiom Europe
with the dtfign of applying it to uftj not
authorised, and that be hasbroken in up
on the fund appropriate uÂ»-the dHcWjr*
Jâ¢f the French debt;' Indeed the" delay ot
information, the receiving it piecemeal,
the abundance ofreafonings and apologies,
when only ,simple an d plain statements
were required, renders a fcruuny of all
his calculations a work of time and l4bor ;
therefore, I have contented itayfelf with
the faÂ£ts that the Secretary acknowledges
and vindicates on the questionable ground
of policy. It remains to be enquired, had
the Secretary a right to depart from the
directions of the law in the execution of
it : could he, without a violation of the
law, divert the money from its appropriate
life to putpofes foreign to the intention of
the legislature ? He certainly could not.
The application of appropriation is the
molt sacred and important trnft the legis
lature can confer ; if they may be made
to bend to the will or proje&ing policy of
a financier, there is an end of all security
and confidence. When a legislature makes
an appropriation of a general fund to a
variety of uses, as has been done with re
fpeÂ£t to the impost, tonnage, excise, See.
there is necefTarily a coufiderable degree
of discretion left with the executive, as far
as refpe&s preference to one or other of
the appropriate uses; but where the tno
ney is appropriated solely to a special pur
pose, as in the cafe of the loans, he who
executes the lsws has no degree of power
over the appropriation. There is ample
room indeed for discretion in many mate
rial circumflances refpefting thtm ; such
as the terms of contract,the times of draw
ing, the agents employed, &c. But to
assume or use a power of changing the
appropriation, is assuming a power to re
peal the law itlelf in its molt essential au
thority ; it is affirming that power ofdif
penling with the laws which produced the
late-revolution with Britain.
If the will of the minister may controul
and give another direction to the will of
the lcgiflature, the fovereigij legislative
authority is transferred from the reprefen
tat-ives of the people to the temporary mi
nister.
If we admit that the ministerial agent
is not refponlible for his conduct, nor fub
jeÂ£t to censure, because he is appointed,
and in this inflance authoiifed by the Pre
sident, we will introduce the long explod
ed do&rine of Charles I. of Britain,
which, brought ruin on the king and go
vernment. However, there is an eflential
difference, for in the cafe before us the
authority and inftruftions given by the
President were.-agreeable to the law, but
the conduct of the minister was contrary
to both.
If, as I have said, the application of
money to its appropriated uses is the most
sacred and impoitant trust which the le
gislature can confer, if the person dire&-
ed to apply the money applies it to what
use he pleases; he may by that means
command all the influence and all the
force of the government. I conclude, that
betraying that important trust partakes of
the nature of treason.
The question before us is not whether
the Secretary has applied to a good or a
bad use ; whether he, by departing from
the legal appropriation supported public
credit better, or made a more convenient
accommodation to what he or his friends
suppose to be the national interest ; the
constitution nor the laws have not consti
tuted him the judge of the national inter
est, nor submitted it to his wisdom to
prescribe thedegree of public credit which
the nation, ought to possess. The public
credit, and other national interests, ought
to be no other than the legislature wills it*
to be ; and ought only to be supported
by the means and in the manner thereby
prescribed. This is the voice of the con
ftitutron, the voice of the law, and the
voice of reason. The President and both
branches of the Legislature being the real
as well as the legal representativeS of the
people it is reasonable that they should be
the sole judges of their interest. When
this House repeatedly called for informa
tion from the Secretsry, they did not call
for political essays, nor laboured apologies,
they did not constitute him the judge or
the inftru&or of the legislature ; they car
ed nothing about his variety of motives,
nor extensive and felf-important plans,
these he might have reserved to embelilh
a system of finance, when he would be a
gain called upon to report to the House ;
they only required an account of his stew
ardship. It was time enough to make a
pologies when he was blamed. Prefacing
his statements with apologies, and being
irritated at enquiries, and artfully evading
so many calls for information, discovered
a corifcioufnefs of blame.
However, I will admit that an execu
tive officer, prefied by fome'urgent arul ;
unexpe&ed neceflity, may be induced to.
depart from the authorized path of duty,
and have great merit in so doing. This
may be the cafe with a general of an a*tny
or an admiral of a fleet; and, though morÂ£
rarely, even with a financier. But in such
immeigency, the officer so acting will
embrace the earliest opportunity to ex
plain the matter and obtain a juitification
whilst the recent feeling*, arising from the
occasion, advocates his cause in the pub
lic mind.
Has the Secretary done so in the pre
sent inltance ? No, his conduct has been
the verv reverse. Notwithstanding repeat
ed and explicit calls, both the latt felfion
and the present, the extent of these tranf
a&ions was concealed. A bill pafled this
Houfeauthoriling another lean of 800,000
dollars. A second bill was urged in an un
precedented manner, for a loan of 2,000-
000 dollars, and though this was a favor
ite bill with the minister, the very enqui
ry after this information induced his
friends to (hrink from the business and de
sert the object about which they had dis
covered so much solicitude.
But when the disclosure is made, does
there appear any urgent neceflity tt) jufti
fy the measure ? No, there Was none ex
cept whatexiftedin theunauthorifed plans
of the financier. He informs us, that he
thought it necessary to have always 5 or
600,000 dollars at his commnad. I a/k
what law authorised him to think
did the legislature think this necessary ?
No. Did he ever state the neceflity to
the legislature ? No, he did not, and we
know he has never been backward in re
commending revenue systems or in con
triving uses for revenue. Suppofmg a
sudden neceflity for money, arising from
a disappointment of some remittance, â
where was the boasted aid of the bank,
which was to have adminifteted aid in all
sudden immergencies ? Could not bills
have been fold for cash when the neceflity
pressed, or could not a temporary loan
have been procured from any of the
banks f Certainly they could; loans wtte
obtained at the bank when no neceflity re
quired such aid, and when the public mo
ney to a much greater amount was depo
sited with the bank. In (hort, no neceffi-'-
ty of state purposes, authorised by the le
gislature, existed. If there was a necefli
ty at all, it mud have arisen from another
quarter, moll probably from the bank it
felf and its brancheÂ»|^^^^^^^^^^^^
A key to this fuggtftion may be _dis
covered from a comparison of the times
of drawing and the situation of the bank
at such times.
[ Here Mr. Findley was called to ot
der, upon the ground of his arguments
not being confined to the resolution be
fore the committee. He alledged his ar
guments applied ftri&ly to the charges of
violating Uie law contained in the resolu
tion ; but as a further opportunity of ap
plying the arguments arising from necessi
ty and discretion would be given, when a
subsequent resolution was brought before
the committee, he would pass it now-with r
a very few remarks.]
He said the exercise of the power as
sumed by the Secretary was inconsistent
with that public confidence upon which
alone the government was founded ; that
it was inconsistent with public fafety and
a government of laws ; that the Secretary
seemed to take the whole government
upon his fhaulders, and to consider all the
great interests thereof to be committed to ,
his providence. His reports spoke the
language of a Frederick of Pruflia, or
some other despotic tyrant, who had all
the power vested in himfelf; not the lan
guage of a dependent Secretary, under "a
free and well-ordered government.
Mr. Lawrance contended that the interest
of the monies borrowed was not paid out of
the principal of the loan, as.set forth in the
charge of the resolution before tbÂ« committee. .
If gentlemen would attend 10 the history of
the tranfaftion, they would find this ftri&ly
true. This interest was paid out of the mo
nies borrowed fbr the reduction of the public
debt, and not out of thole intended to pay the
French, and the funds appropriated for the
payment of that interest were here, to replace
the former and be applied as those were ap
propriated. He refetred to the President's
speeches at the commencement of the twb>
I ift sessions, to (hew that the loan was obtain
ed under the joint authority of both acts ; and
adverted totheaft of Congrefs,in consequence
et' a doubt suggested by the Secretary, ex
plaining that the monies firft obtained might
be considered as borrowed under the ast au
thorising the 2,000,900 loan. Having (hewn
the firft charge in the resolution to be unfound
ed, he turned to the second.
The Secretary is accused of drawing njo-
326
Mies'to this country without iftftrtifHutis !n
I'thtt trih&Aion,-fe (kid, the President inuft
be ctfnfidered as principal and the Secretary
tfre agent, or the Secretary molt be looked
uport as the principal. If the President is the
principal, and he be authorized to obtai- the
loan*,'!!'! soon as the tiioney is obtained, it na
turally falls under the di reft ion of the tinan
c er; tyit if it be contended that thePrelident
wa* to have applied the monies as well as to
' borrow them, then we have nothing to do
with the agent; that agent is accountable to
his principal, and as this principal is not called
to an account by the legislature for any im
proper exercise of dilcietion, he must be con
iidered as having acted ftriftly within the law.
If the Secretary is considered as the principal
(and by a drift attention to the law, he believ
ed, it would be found so, for the President ii
fc by itauthorifed to borrow, and it is not ex
prefled who (hall apply the money) then it
was not one of the duties of the Secretary to
procure the inftruftions of the Prelident, be
ing the principal, and consequently. having the
direftionof the money borrowed, he is made
the judge of the time of drawing, hint to fulfil
i the intentions of the law. >Vas, the money,
he alked, to have, remained in the bands of
the banker in Europe ? Since it was borrowed
for the purchafeof the public debt, the sooner
it was drawn over the better, and the Secre
tary, having the direction of those monies,
could do it without consulting tne President.
He proceeded to Ihew, however, that the
Secretary had by no means aftedentirely with
out regard to the President's inftruftions. His
letter to Mr. Short, which had been read, ex
pressly fays, that he is waiting for inftruftions
from the President, and the only inftruftions
brought forward clearly lhewed that he did
not ast without them. On this occasion it
was not necelTary, he conceived, that all the
private communications between those two
officers (hould be brought forward ; indeed,
many of the inftruftions might have been
verbal, and of a private nature. Another
proof lies before the committee to strew that
the Secretary did not ast independent of in
ftruftions. A report of the Secretary men
tionsâthat some matters relative to the
loans were under the confederation of the
President of the United States. This docu
ment, he remarked, the gentlemen were in
pofleffion of when they framed the resolutions;
and it, in his opinion, left very little ground
indeed to suppose that the Secretary had acted
without inftruftions.
That officer, he contended, had ftriftly o
beyed the appropriation law; he had not drawn
one dollar that the ast did not warrant. On
the authority of one ast, the Secretary drew
two millions (by the bye he wished to remark,
that the Secretary is not the officer who actu
ally draws, who fells the bills, or who recÂ«ives
the*uoney ; this falls within the province of
the treasurer, the Secretary does not toueb
a penny of those monies) to apply to the re
duction of the public debt. The other ast,
he laid, gave the Prefidftnt power to draw
every dollar of the loan it established, if he
thought fit, if those who were to receive the
money wilhed to be paid here. Will the re
mittance which afforded so seasonable a relief
to St. Domingo, be found fault with? l( this
â¢ mode of paying was within the authority veil
ed in the President, surely the power of draw
ing must have accompanied it. He concluded
by observing, that he had stated his ideas on

IN SENATE, January 39, 1795.
The Committee to whom was referred
the Motions before the Senate, rela-
tive to the Measures ir Weights
of the United States, âreport,
id. f I H HAT the ftaudard for the measures and
X weights of the United States be an
uniform cylindrical rod of Iron, of such length
as in the latitude of fortv-five degrees jn the level
of the ocean, an<s in an apartment of Uniform
temperature, (ball perform its vibrations in one
second of mean time f that the diameter of such
rod (Hall not be more than the hundred and
twentieth part of its length, nor the arc of its vi
brations more than, four degrees, and that the
said standard rod fliall be divided into four hun
dred and eighty-nine equal parts.
2dâ That the unit of measures of length (hall
be a foot, which (hall be equal in length to one
hundred parts of the aforefaid standard rod.
That sixty-six feet .(hall be a chain, and eighty
chains a mile. ,
3d. That measures of furface he made by
squares of the measures of length ; but in the
cafe of land the unit shaH be an acre, which (hall
contain forty-three thousand five hundred and
sixty fquarc feet.
4th. That the unit of the measures of capacity
fliall be a bushel, which shall contain one cubic
foot and a quarter of a cubic foot.
sth. That the unit of weights (hall be a pound,
which ftiall be equal in weight to iixteen thou
sand cubic cents of afoot of rain water, mca
fured and weighed in an apartment of uniform
temperature.
6th. That the onitsof the measures 8c weights
of the Uaited States {Hal 1 be divided mho cents
or hundredth parts, and where necessary into
mills or thousandth pans ; and in the cafe of
weights the mill (hall be divided into seven
grains.
E x Pl. AV aT -o N Â»f the REPORT of the Committee
of the Senate, to whom the Subject oj Weights
and Measures tvas referred
THE report Qf the "orrimittee is founded on
the principle t"hat a ror* winch vibrates seconds
in the latitude of foil ,-five degrees, isfifty.eight
inefic* and fixty-etght trifo4Â«cdths ef *
length; by dividing a rod ol that kÂ«f a U ||o
four hundred and eighty-nin<?tqual pari*, o 'ne
hundred ot those par's will be equal lotwci*-
o\ the above mentioned inches, or ihe foot no*
in ufc. In this way a rod may be made a hâ, u
dard, and if ihemealufes in use be lolloÂ» fcccutuo
uncertain, it may be always refortrd to in auy
pait of the United States, by making due allow
â¢lice* according to the oi latitude.
The committee propose to make certain mea
sures and weights now in use, the units of the
measures and weights of ibe Untied States, that
the adoption of the fyltem may bt the uioteesif
to the community, as no difference will t|* c
place iit the contents of the units. It is alio pro
posed that the unitsbe di *Â«ed intoccn Â»
or hundredth parts ; this division wuuia make
the arithmetic necessary lor the corantmi p U r.
poses of life easy to every capacity, as the tour
simple rules would be fufficicnt, without tnc
compound methods; and as the divifion*of thÂ«
units of the measures and weights would bctbo
fame with those of the unit of the money pt acÂ«
count, the fame species of arithmetical calcula
tion would take place, and the compulsion of
either would soon be easy and familiar. Bjrjhc
division of the units io'o cents, the denoniiQa.
tions of the measures and weights would be lcÂ«*
in number, and those familiar to our ideas, ao4
the memory would be no longer Dunhened with
the perplexing multiples and diviftous of
present measures Â«nd weights. ' t
la the measures of length, it is proposed that
he foot, chain and mile should remain the fame
s those now tn use. The divifiou of the loot
nto cent?, will be convenient for workmen, a*
2untei's carpenter's rule, which is generally
ifed, is divided into cents, a# well as into
nches; so that the relative proportion between
hem may be easily afcert?ined. The chain it
he instrument gtnerally used in meafurmg dif- .
ances, and is found fiom experience to be the
moil convenient length for a&ual mensuration;
it is four of the prefe'nt rods or poles, twenty
two yards, or sixty-six feel ; and ten chains
make one of the present furloiig*r
In the measure of land, theaÂ«.-re is> proposed
to be the fame as the present acre, auQ in mea
faring of land the chain is also used ; it is alrea
dy divided into hundredth parts, called links ;
chains and links multiplied by chains nd links,
give acres and decimals of an acre, which hasoc
cafioned the division of an acre into cents, to
prevail already in some of the dates, in ptefer
ence to roods ami perches.
In meafutesiof capacity, the bulhel is pro
posed to be a cubic foot and a quarter, or two
thousand one hundred and sixty cubic inches,
which is about a mean of the (everal bushels now
in use; fomÂ« of the states having bulhels con
taining near fifteen cubic inches more, and o
thers near as much less,âit is the quantity pro
posed by the Secretary of State in his report oil'
measures and weights; his idea is also adopted -
of abolifliing the diftinflion between wet and
dry measures, of disregarding the Ate and Wine
gallons, and of having only one measure of OK
pacity. Hy dividing the bulhel into cents, an
easy reference may be made from the cents to
the different mcÂ®ftircÂ»-of capacity now in use :
'1 Fjftj o>.uiu ta iUkfrc equal to thÂ« halt bufbel, and
twenty-five cents to the peck.
In weights, the pound is proposed to be the
fame as the Avoirdupois pound, and the grain
the fame as the Troy grain ; by dividing the
pound into cents, the cents into tenths or mills,
and the mill into seven grains, a series is formed
which conne&s with exadlnefs the pound Avoir
dupois with the grain Troy. In weighing large
quantities the Avoirdupois series is used ; in
weighing valuable articles, as gold, silver or dia
monds, or small quantities as medicines, the
Troy series is used the two series may there
fore be tonne&ed so as to make but one Ipecies
of weights necefiary, without any inconveni
ence : T.he weights tor gold and filver,the tteel- .
yards, and the common iron weights, may con
tinue to be uied, and be adapted to the utw
series.

HAVE you not fern in faffron dreft, the Sun
Burlt thro* the crvftal portals of the day ;
While fogs, and blights, fact from his presence
runâ
And million* breathe but in his genial ray :
When soon an angry-cloud the sky,
And darkncfs tinges, every blooiniflg tccne-â
The promis'd blessings of tjie morning fly,
And thunder hoaifly murmurs o'er the plain.
Byt Phoebus quite unmov'd It renely.glides
Behind the vapour of night's ebon throtie,
Hurls it in air, and (hews that he presides,
With splendor equal to protest his own.
So. have. I seen in our new hemisphere,
A star refulgent riseâwhose potent ray
Pierc'd thro* the dread opaque that hover'd near,
And gave exiftcnce to our infant day.
So have I seen a man of honor flitne,
And with' nice re&itude b'egin his race ; â 
Stringing each nerve with energy divine,
To-fave his country from the foul disgrace
Of blasted credit, and theJhades of wealth ââ 
Of broken faith, and infamy supreme ;
Restoring (Irength, and confidence, and health,
To bankrupt funds, ihat were an empty name.
When vile intrigue, with all her little art,
And her dire nest of hornÂ«ts, soon prepar'd
To vex the honest veteran to the heartâ
And by surprize to throw him off his guard.
But fair Integrity repuls'd the foe,
And soon dilTolv'd the spells they had begun ;
While well-earn'd fame with truths celestial
glow. ,
Rtflefts new lustre on Â«ur Hamilton.
EXTRACT.
u THAT I am by birth, or family better
than any others of my fellow creatures, is an
absurdityâbut if uature has bestowed 011 me
favors that Ihe has withheld from others, or
given to others talents that she has denied to
jne, surely in the firft cafe, I pofTefs a fuperi
-ority over them, but in the last cafe, they over
me. This diftinftion is grounded in nature,
for in fact nature has created it; and when,
ever Ihe bellows superior talents on indivi
duals, and dire&s them to their proper object,
those individuals, thus favored, will in spite
of art, become superior to others, and not
only command but deserve greater refpejt.
To contend then for equality in an unlimit
ed sense, is to struggle against nature and to
deny the justice of ProvidenceâA person
might aim oil as well attempt to eftablifb a
system of univeffjrfcepticifnv ; for until we
lose all confidence in the teitimony us our
senses, we cannot believe the doctrine. I' it
be really true thatperfeff equality does, or can
exist, then rewards and punifliments must
cease, and to talk of superior merit is to ul'e
words without meaning, for ptrfefl equality
does not admit of the fmalleftdiftinftion."

Funding the public debt is a great crime,
and those who make a noise about it, ofcourfe
would have us think they have a great deal
of* merit by their hatred of the system. Sure
ly they reckon their own score of merits
fomswhat like bad accountants. Did the
party in Congress the mod opposed to the re
port oPthe Secretary of the Treafnry on the
public debt, oppose funding T They did notâ
at least if they are to be believed. They
would have funded at fix per centâthey would
have funded in favor of original creditors.
Their newspaper trumpeters have ever since
held up the rights of the army and of the ori
ginal holders, and the merits of those who
would have preferred their claims to all others.
Yet these fame blusterers condemn the fund
ing systemâWhat absurdity. They hate mo
nied systems, and mysteries, and jobs. They
are too pure to receive such foul ideas as
those of faith and public credit into theirin
fpirt=d mindsâThey would however have
paid more money and admitted more claims
thaq the majority in Congress agreed toâand
how was this to be done } by funding at fix
per cent. Perhaps some tell-tale will fay,
thijinconfiftency is apparent and not real.
We did not intend to fund nor pay a farthing
âit was only a means of baffling and defeat
ing the majority, and we came very near ac
pwnpfHhing our plan. This defence will be
allowed to explain the conduct of tbe oppof.
ersof the funding aftâBut facts as they ap
pear without such explanation, lhew that the
pretended haters of funding systems, and 1110-
nied febemes, and mysteries, would have fund
ed the debtâln doing so they would have
made the debt bigger by giving new certifi
cates to the officers and soldiers, and heavier
by voting an higher rate of interest.âLet the
people now discontented with the doings of
Congress, therefrtre, attend to facts and be
undecÂ«ived. âWhat is done they think badâ
Their pretended friends would have made it
worse.
The party which diftingui(hes itfelf by an
opposition to the government of the ,United
States, is frequently calling the public atten
tion to the patriots of '7 J âand raodeftly ar
rogates to itfelf a species of merit, which all
the world is ready to acknowledge the allert

justly entitled to. âA few particulars may
serve to fre -A (he striking contrast between
the 10., of anarchy, and those diftingtiiihed
friends of freedomâThe latter wrote awainft,
and opposed a government, over which the

the work of the people, whose basis is their

them; a inagiftracy which was in the gift of
