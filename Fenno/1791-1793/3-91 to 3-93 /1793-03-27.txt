CONGRESS. â¢
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY,' March r.
' In committee of the whole, Mr. MuHlenberg
< ' in the chair, on the 3d, 4th, stb, 6th, 7th,
and Bth refolntions, refpefting the offidaf
cinduft of the Secretary of the Treasury,
1 for which fee Gazette of the 6th inft.
J ( (Mr. Madison'j Speech concluded.)
T'HE other attempt to elude the. erideilcf
. before the Comntittjgjecoiled with eqvtal
. fiSrt? 011 the gentlemen wlio bad hazardedit.
In the report lately made by the trnfteesof
i the linking fund, is a statement laid befire
â  them by the Secretary, in which it is noted,
that the acceptance of-the loan of three mil
â¢< liÂ«Â»as of florins, and the application, of one
third of it to ftie purpose of that fund,'was
, un<ier the cogfide ration of the President."
From thlsYaft it bad been interred, not on
ly that the secretary had withheld no proper
iiifu-ination from the tfuftees, but that the
rciilt of the President's deliberations on the
â¢ fubteft bad varied the purpose lighMi&d by his
$riit iuftruftioos to the secretary.
Jt happened however 1110 ft unfortunately
for the gentlemen'who exulted in this argu
ment, that they had entirely overlooked the
dates of the two papers. The paper laid be
fore the trustees, and alledged to have explain
ed the final purpose of the President, was dat
ed on the 2jth of August, 1790. The paper
relied on by the othef fide, as ' js final, as* well
as the mpft formal, deflgnation of tiie will of
the President, was dated the 28th of Augnft,
1713- The gentlemen, therefore, instead of
the inference they had made, should have re
versed their premises, and joined' with their
j opponents in concluding that the Prefideni
j was a consideration of the fubjeft, Hot
to do what the secretary in his note to thd
trustees feeined to anticipate, but whai had
â  been evinced by the President's own' ast of
posterior date.
Much has been said on the necessity of
, foroetimes.departing from.the ftriftnefs of le
_ gal appropriations, as a plea for anyfre?doins
that/may have been taken with them' by the
secretary. He would not deny that there
â¢ W emergencies, in 'the cburÃ of human
â affairs, tjf To extraordinary artd preffing-a na
ture, as to absolve the executive frorii an in
flexible conformity to thc of the r
law. It was, nevertheless, as efTential to re
member, aS it was obvious to that
in ail such cases, the necessity should be pal
pable ; that the executive fanftjon should
flow from the supreme source ; and that the 1
firfl opportunity should be feiztd for commu
nicating to the (jSgifiature the measures pur-
I'ued, with the reafqos explaining the necessity
of fhem. Th|s early communication was e
qutlly enfotcid by prudence and by duty. It
was the best evidence o'f thÂ£ motive's for as
suming the extraordinary pbwer ; it was a
due to the legi/iative au
thority ; if was more particularly indis
pensable, as tfcit.alofle would enable the legis
lature, by a provident amendment of the law,'
to accommodate it to like emergencies in fu
we. , ,
In tlie proceedings falling under theprerent
enquiry, no necessity appeared for the liber
ties which had b?en taken, the money appro
priated in Eprope being tfiore wanted there'
than at home. It appeared that the jnftruc
tions of the Supreme Executive.' iiifteVd of.
varranting thofi; libertiesj had precluded;
iiem. Nor had the proper explanations 6een
Jifclofed in duwtime to the legislature. .
To place the fiÂ»bjeft.in a morf tfiftiiift point'
of view, it wasproper toadv'ext to the
mtborities and. duties.of* the Â£-cre r tary, as his'
afSce is defined'by the ast establishing the
1 trpaiury department. For this pnrpofe Mr.
M..read the second feftion of that ast, which'
is in the words followingâ" That it stall be
the duty of ,the ftcretnry of the treasury to
idifeft and prepare plans for the improvement
< iivd management of the revenue, and fur the
support of public credit ; to prepare and're
pott eflimate's of the public revenue, arid the
public.expenditures ; io fupti intend the colUOion
tjtherevenue ; t.o decide on Jlje. fprms of keep
ing and stating accmiotsandmaking returns,
and to grant under the limitations herein ef
tabli'lbed, or to be hereafter provided,'all war
rants for monies/o ft ijfued from ike treasury,
in pnrfuance of appropriations by law.; to cx
, ecu re fycb fervit^s.relative to the.sale <jf the
lands belonging to .the'limited States,, a j may
be By law retjulredl' of him { jo make
1 and give information to either branch of the
in person" or in writing (as he
may be required) refpefting all matters re
ferred to him by the Senate or House of Re
prerentativÂ«s, p)T which fbaU appertain to.hu
office ; and generally to perfprm ajl fuchfer
vices relative to,Jthe finances, as he shall be
directed to perform." ' * ,
This eftaMifhment of the office, evidently
had no reference beyond the cafe of fuperift
tending the regular and ordinary cotitctim of
tie reunite, and granting warrants for mpnies
i/fueifriru the treafurj, in parfuamre of appro
prlattoas by law.
AEST,
[Whole No. 408.]
f The cafe of loans, as an ocoafional and ev
'/''aarclinary resource, waj left to be provided
,/or by particular laws for the purpoie. The
Authority with refpeft to the loans in guefli
on was accordingly committed to the i'refi-
I dent, in order to secure for so special a trnft,
the higlieft refponiibilityjto he found in the
government. And .when it was conljdej ed
that the whole fun> contemplated wkis no lets
than fourteen millions of dollars; and wLen
the latitude as to the terms and contracts
was combined with the vaftnefs of the futn ;
it might well be questioned whether so great
a power would have been delegated to any
man in whom the legiflaturc and the people of
America, lels confidence than they so j nit
ty reposed in the existing chief magiflrate;
and whether an equal power will ever be coii.-
nrtte;! to a successor.
This diftfnftion between the cafe of ordina
nary revenue and that of loans, is. not only
consonant to the a<ftual policy of our Jaws,
but is foiinded in'obvious and solid ccnfifleja
tious.
In the collection and dilburlVment of the
ordiiiary revenues arising from taxation',' the
bufiriefs flows in official channels; is fubjeft
lii every stage to official checks ; and the mo
ney being w constant influx and effl'uxj 1:0
where accumulates in imjnenje fumj.
Tj'he ca(e o*"loans is in ail thele pefpefts
different. In fettling the'tcirps and arrang
ing the negotiations, ther&'jii aj\yays aii im
portant discretion involyecf. the loans
are foreign as well as great, regulations con
cerning the bills offexchangefjfiti'ailower oc
caiop where great latitude is implied in the
trull. Whilst the the funis fall
ing under the fame direction at tlie firne jho
ment, prelent a fur thffr and material variance
between the; two cases.
The tendency of thele obfervatiofls, j s t to
(hew, that as thi permanent law qlfablifhir.g
the treafurv t does not extend the
authority of the secretary to,the cafe of ; loanr,
and as the law authorizing loans, exaftSj for
special reasons, a refponfibijity from the pre
sident himfeTf, the authority of the secretary
in executing the loans and the appropriation
of them, rnuft be derived from the JPrefideiit;
and, cotifequently where the autliiotJty fajls,
there pan be no resort, to the law eitablifliing
. much Id's tp any general Hif
cretion incident to his official charaffer. Jtr
is,evident,- that the President, although no
doubt guided by the molt proper confiderati
ons'in employing the agency of the fee etai y
of the treafuryin the bufineisof the loans,
might, if lie forjudged fit, Ijave fubfiitiited
the agency of another ; and that whatcyer
agency he might prefer, his own inftru<stions
would always regulate the extent and exfirciia
of the power conferred,
, ,Tbe want.of any apparent authority from
the President had led several gentlemen to in
, fift on presumed authorities, fuperce|ding the
inftruvTi.ons joined with the (jommiifion to the
secretary : But here again the fair inference
was to bp revcrfed. A communication of tie
authorities given by the President to the se
cretary as,lto tVie application of the foreign
loans,had been expreftly requested by.the vote
of the house. It was not to Be fpppofed that
the secretary, if he-had received furtjier au
, thorities or iiiftruftions would,have faileÂ«Â£to
. produce tjhenl, or to ,refer to, them, in the jus
tification of his eondjnft. Far leis could it be
r presumed that the President, if he had given
any fuperceding authorities or inflruoions,
would not have caul'ed them to be coiujmuii
-1 cated to the house ; or that he wpuld have
fuffered a partial communication to iniflead
the houle into an error, as tofo important a
fh<st. The President was the last man in (he
world to whom any measure whatever of a
deceptive tendency Could be credibly attfi'ibut-
~ve tei.
Thus far, said Mr. Madison, bis obfervi'
ions had departed as little as pofliblf from thi
[lieftlon in its ftrifteft sense. He Ihould now
ivail himfelf of the opportunity afforded b)
he terms of the last clause, which spoke nt
Irafts generally, to take a more particular
lotice of those recently made; in doing which
ie considered himfclf fafe within the rules of
he House, which were so rigorously enforced
igainft the affirmative fide of the question.
TJie whole amount of foreign Iqans tranf
erred directly or indirectly to the United
itates, appeared from the several statements
.0 be about three millions of dollars.
The aipount of the direst draughts was
(,304,769 13.
Ot the drafts made ftnee the 16th of Apri),
1792, and fold by the bank, the proceeds, now
in the bank, or payable into it, before the Ift
>f April next, amount to 1,220,4:76 r dollars.
Of this fuin, 5)0,000 dollars have been drawn
With, refpeft to time and t&e amount of
fhefe draft l ;, {lithe absolutely unknown
to tho Legiljature, because the account of
them had remained in the books of the banlc
without ever appearing in the books of the
Treasurer... Mr, JWad)fon conftffed that he
had toupd po explanations th ?t to hjn, were

knowledge of"the President; or lad been re

to the trufteÂ«s of the (hiking fund, who had
the direftlon of fuclrporcjiafes; or 'that tbejr
were the etfeftof any ueceflity. that Cyuld jus
tify thtm. \
And if there was no evident necciHty f?r
the proceeding, it w.ai the>moie to be lahisnt
ed, chat wbilft we we're every where f)n;pa
thifing with our in their a'duousftrug
gles for liberty, and echoing from every part
of the union, our and food
withe,, the.pecuniary fuct.ouri, lb critically
necessary to their cause, and the most !Ã¼b
ftantial proof of the fvueerity of our pri|''ef
fio'ris, (hould be silently withdrawn across the
Atlantic, from the object for which they w re
intended ; fuccotirs too, which were not mere
ly a tribute of gratitude, of geflerofity, orof
binevofent zeal for the triumph of liberty;
hut Si debt moreover of ffricl and positive oft
-1 gation, for value ackliowleded and received.
In contemplating the fubjeft in this point of
view, lit felt a pain which he cbuld not easily'
express ; "and'to which he persuaded himfelf,
the bread of no other meni&er could be a
stranger.
Laying aside however alt these unfavora
ble considerations, the important question still
remained, why the legislature had been unin
formed of the monies so unexpectedly drawn
into the bank, and to so very great an a
mount. If the drafts had received every rÂ«-
quifite fanftioriâ;f they had been produced by
the mod'juftifiable caafes, xhe exiflence of
1,220,476 dollars in a situation so different
from what had been contemplated, was a fact,
which the repre-eut'ativffs of the people had a
right to know; which it was important' to
them, and their c?nditi\ents, that they should
know; and which it was the indispensable
duty of the officer charged with it, to'' bave
Iftade known.
This omission-was the more remarkable,
when COrtfukred in relation to the measure
above' mentioned, of paying off at once the
whole Dim of 2,609,960 dollars, payable to
the bank by irtftalments In ten years. A bill
for this purpose had l>eeji introduced, and was
on its passage. Tile object of it had been pa
tronized by a icport of the Secretary not long
firttfe Jhadfc- In one of his last reports, be ex
pressly among the inducements to such
extenfiYeirfrafts Â°f money frotn Europe, that
they were made " with an eye to placing
within the reach of the legislature"âthe
means requisite for this object. Was it not
extraordinary; was it not unaccountable,
that'!'o important a measure (hould be recom
mendeclj and be actually introduced, and that
money otberwife appropriated in Edrope,
flfOuld be transferred to this country afid de
posited in the,{rank, in order that it might be
within the reach of being applied by tlie legis
lature to that meafureand yet that no dif
eTofure Jhoukl be made to the legislature of
the fas, that the money was so drawn aiid
lay at ttie batik within their reach tot>4'<bap
plied.'-.
If any thing could heighten aftonifhroenton
this oeVaftoii, it inuft be the reason afligned.by
the Seqf'etWy tor any obfeurity that might
. liave hung over our finances,âthat till the
last resolutions, 110 call had been made on the
department, which rendered it proptr to exhibit
a.genera) view of the public monies and funds,
â¢Or to rfiew the amount and situation of such
->as were unapplied." Mr. Madison would
not decide that the Legislature was free from
Maine, in not using more full and efficacious
means of obtaining such .information, as would
have removed all obfeurity. But whatever
degree of blame might fall on them, it never
eould be admitted, that their calls on the de
partment had furnifhed no proptr occasion for
exhibiting a fnll view of the public finances.
He referred generally to the various resolu
tions, which, without the lead force of con
ftruftion, would have extended to every pro
per article of information. He reminded the
committee of the latitude of reports under
certain other orders of the hnufe ; and asked
Vjiether less freedom of .ponftruftion was to
be allowed when information was to he giver,
tli'an when power or discretion was Â£0 be ex
ercised ? But independently of this view of
the raatte{, Mi\ M. held it to be clear and
palpable, that the very situation of the 1110,
ney, afforded in occaiion which rendered it
proper, that the House Ihoaki be informed of
i*. If ajiberty could be taken> of removing
. m'qiiey from Europe where it flood appropri
ated by law, to this country, where there was
nd legal object that required it, and with an
eye," as was dated, to an object to which no
nrOrrey was applicable, without the authority
of tlie Legislature, how could it possibly be
. supposed improper to take the furtlier liberty
of communicating wliat Was done, to tlie Le
gislature ?
He concluded with recurring to the parti
ycular form, in which the fubjeft presented it
felf to the committee, arid repeating, that
whatever qualify might be attached to the
facts charged, or however improper it might
be thought by some, to proceed-in bade to any
affirmative decijion on tlrem, it appeared ir
reconcileahle with the evidence which had
been produced, to decide, by a negative vote,
against the truth of the facts. â¢ â¢

the subsequent affirmation, that the

will support the opening of the

traced the steps which have led to this revo

.and all thej.convullions n<nv agitating the
kingdom, haste proceeded, from the Qoeen'*
patronage of the American eaufe; and had
that sprung from her ?eaT for its freedom, it
would have been laudable ; bit on the con

.the Englilh nation.âThe King who Mr.
Burke extols .as amongst the heft of Monarchy
and aspofTeffing the of hearts, has him
. felf most cfientially conduced to destroy the
peace of his kingdom, and to endanger the
lives and royal profpe^ts-of his own immedi

Clergy, Nobles and Commons, intooue House:
his fatal connivance at this Ast, which de

âThe motives for the Queen's conduct were
fatally viadi&ive ; to the policy of LoyU
wretchedly temporising in that fit ft deltruc

afcribable alone.
