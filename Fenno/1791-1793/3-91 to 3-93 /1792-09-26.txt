FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER.
MR. Dunlap,
THE public have been lately amu r ed with
lome criticisms in the United States Ga
zette, upon the political chara&er and conduct
tÂ»f the Secretary of"State. The charges exhi-,
t>ited against him, in substance, amount to this :
1. That he was always inimical to the present
government, and has in a particular manner
shewn it since he came into office, by the free
dom with which he has cenfnrsd public measures.
2. That he has abused the trust reposed in him,
by confering the appointment of tranllator of
foreign languages, in the department of State,
worth 2s~) dollars per annum, upon Mr. Fre
neau, Editor of the National Gazette. This
appears to be the sum of the charges : whatever
else they contain is the figurative amplification
of the writer only, and reducible to no
head.
To that refpe&able tribunal to whom they
hare been submitted, upon the fa&sand illultra
tions given, partial as they are, so far as it ref
pefts himfelf the decision might be left without
a comment, fits countrymen have beep too
long and too well acquainted with his talents,
virtues, and services, to fuffer loose and equi
vocal charges of this kind to leflen him in their!
estimation. But this attack liasobvioully some
thing further in view, than (imply to wound the
fame of one deserving citizen. It is levelled at
that free and manlyYpirit of enquiry, which has
lately developed the principles, and demonstra
ted the mischievous tendency of some, of the
measures of government, and which it seeks to
crush, a spirit of enquiry which the author sup
poses has been foftered and cherished by him.
Ifaperfon of his note in the republican lift,
could be destroyed in the public confidence, its
cause would be humbled, and the friends of mo
narchy triumph. An attack, therefore, upon
this gentleman, mult be deemed a direst but
artful one upon principles, and in this view it
becomes a matter of public concern, and merits
particular attention.
What was his political conduct in early life,
through the revolution, and to the adoption of
the pre ent government, though the period was
momentous and eventfu', and the several fta
t ions' which lit- occupiejf futh &-â¢ presented him
perpetually to the view of his countrymen,
seems of no importance upon the present occa
sion. This long and honorable career has el
caped the censure of the American, and I fha.ll
not review it for the fake of applause. I have
alluded to it merely to ftiew, that if he has not
kept pace, in all the revolutions of opinion,
pra&ifed by those who now censure him, he has
liotwithllauding been always consistent with
himfelf.
Before I proceed in reply to the firft charge,
to furnifh the documents which it is presumed,
will place his political sentiments in a fatisfac
tory point of view, a previous general question
lhould be noticed, which though not particular
ly conne<sted with him, may be deemed of im
portance to the community : " Wherein was
the merit or oifence of a favorable or unfavor
able opinion of the constitution, and to whom
rendered V It was aÂ»propofition of great ex
tent, submitted as of right to every free ci
tizen, and npon which he was bound to decide ;
to have lhrunk from it would have been dis
honorable, and a fiiameful abandonment of his
duty. By what rule then, or upon what prin
ciple, (hall a man be rewarded or punished, for
the fair exercise of his judgment, efpeciallv
when called on to give it, by obligations he could
not resist, and upon a point, in which in prefer
ence to all others, the most unbounded free
dom should be u(ed ? I had supposed that if his
decision was a wife one, the benefits of the fyf
tein were to be his compensation ; if he erred,
his own and the calamities of his countrvf the
punishment ; that the question involved in it,
neither in the origin, nor its consequences, con
liderations oj' a personal nature, and that of
coiirfe the conduct of no man, in relation to
this object, be it what it might, merited reward
or punilhment. I could wilh that thole politi
cal casuists, who are acquainted with the trans
actions on the great theatre, would solve this
problem ; for to me it seems indifpenlibly ne-1
celfary tiiat thofewho arraign a fellow-citizen, j
before the bar of the public, should at least de
monstrate that the charge with which he" is ac
cused, contains in it fomethiug criminal.
It will be remembered that at the time the!
constitution was formed, and whilst under dif- :
cuflion in the State conventions, Mr. JefFerfon
was in France the minister of America. That
of the train of events which brought about the
important crisis of a general convention, as of
thoie which followed it, he was an interested,
but a distant fpeftator. â¢The nature of the trust
reposed in him by the public confined him to the
ipot. The only part he could bear in .the cares
ot that momentous period, was to unite with
liis fellow citizens in the molt fervent wishes,
that their labors might be fuccefsful, and re
dound to the advantage of their common country.
What his sentiments were on the fubjeft of j
the conltitution, and that of government gene-1
rally as conne<sÃd with it, will be seen by the ,
following extracts taken from his letters ad-!
dreifedtoa particular friend, at the time oi
their refpedive dates, and in the cotirfe of a
A NATIONAL PAPER, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY "JOHN FENNO, No. 6q, HIGH-STREET, PHILADELPHIA
very tnterefting and confidential correspondence.
As he could not have forefeen that in any pofl;-
ble event, they would be laid before the public,
they inuft be confide red as the free and iponta
neous effufions of his heart. From that friend
I have received them, and will if any doubtj
should be suggested oftheir authenticity, im
mediately make them acceflible to others. To
Mr. Jerferfon, whole approbation to this mea
sure, has neither been a iked nor obtained, some
apology for the freedom is due : to the confi
dence however which his own conduct has in
spired, that it was never his wifh,his sentiments,
up<fethis or any other fubje& of a public na
tujflfhould be with-held from his countrymen,
I it be attributed.
* u The season admitting only of operations
ftn the Cabinet, and these being in a great mea-
secret, I have little to fill a letter.
Werefore make up the deficiency by adding a
Few words on the constitution proposed by our
convention. I like much the general idea of
framing a government which should go on o
itfelf peaceably, without n.â¢ Ming continual re
venue from the Irate legiiiaUu'el like the? or
gaiiization of the government into legislative
judiciary, and executive. I like the pov.e
given the legislative to levy taxe lam cap
tivated by the compromise of the oppofit*
claims of the great and little states, of the lat
ter to equal, and the former to proportional in
fluence. Xam much pleased too with the fubfti
tution of the method of voting by persons, in
stead of that of voting by states : and I like th<
negative given to the executive with a third o:
either house, though I should have liked it bet
ter, had the judiciary been appointed for thai
purpose, or inverted with a similar and feparatc
3ower. There are other good things of iel<
moment. I will now add what Ido not like,
Fir ft, the omillion of a bill of rights, providing
ilearly and without the aid of sophisms for free
dom of religiori, freedom of the press, protec
:ion against standing armies, re {trillion againfl
uonopolies, the eternal and unremitting forec
)f the habeus corpus laws, and trials by jury ir
ill matters of faer triable by the laws of the
and, and not by the law of nations. To fa\
hat a bill of rights was not necelTary becaufc
ili is refervct! inthe cafe of the general govern
uent which is not given, while in the particular
â¢nesall is given which is not reserved, is fuvely
. gratis di&um, opposed by strong inferences
rom the body of the instrument, as well as from
he omifiion of the clause of our present confe
leration, which had declared that in express
erms. It was a hard conclusion to fay because
lj|f!te has been no uniformity among the states,
s to the cases triable by jury, because some
lave been so incautious as to abandon this mode
if trial, therefore the more prudent states fliall
te reduced to the fame level of calamity. It
vould have been much more just and wife to
lave concluded the other way, that as most of
he states had judiciously preserved this palla
dium, those who had wandered should be brought
tack to it, and to have established general right
nftead of general wrong. Let me add that. a
â¢ill of rights is what the people are entitled to
igainft every government on earth, general or
and that no just government should
efufe, or reft on inference. The second fea
ure I dislike, and greatly dislike, is the aban
lonment in every instance of the neceflity of
otation in office, and most particularly in the
;afe of the president. Experience concurs
vith reason in concluding that the firft magif
rate will always be re-ele&ed if the conftitu
ion permits it. He is then an officer for life.
V his once observed, it becomes of so much con
equence to certain nations to have a friend or
i foe, at the head of our affairs, that they will
nterfere with money and with arms. A gallo
nar, or an angloinan, will be fupportetkby the
lation he befriends; if once ele&ed, and at a
second or third election out voted by one or two
rotes, he will pretend falfe votes, foul play,
lold pofTeflion of the reins of goverment, be fup
>orted by the States voting for him, eipeciailv
f they arc the central ones, lying in a corupaft
>ody themfelves,and separating their opponents :
ind they will be aided by one nation of Europe,
vhile the majority are aided by another. The
ile&ion of a President of America some years
lence, will be much more interesting to certain
latior.s of Europe, than ever the election of a
Cing of Poland was. Reflexion ail the inftan
â¢es in history ancient and modern, of elective
nonarchies, and lay if they do not give founda
ion for my fears. The Roman emperors, the
'opes, while they were of any importance, the
serman emperor? till they became hereditary
n practice, the Kings of Poland, the Deys of
he Ottoman dependencies. It may be said that
i elections are to be attended with these dii
â¢rders, the feldomer they are renewed the bet
er. But experience shews that the only way
o prevent disorder is to render them uninter
ifting by frequent changes. An incapacity to
>e clewed a second time would have been the
mlv eifeftual preventative. The power of re
noving him every fourth year by the vote of
he people, is a power which will not be exer-'
iled. The King of Poland i-, removable every]
lay bv the Diet, yet he is never removedâl
mailer objections are the appeal in fact as well
s law, ai-.i the binding all persons legislative,
133
executive and judiciary by oath to maintain
that constitution. I do not pretend to decide,:
what would be the belt method of procuring the
eftabiiihment of the manifold good things in
this cpnftitution, and of getting rid ot the bad.
Whether by adopting it in hopes ot future a
mendment, or after it has been duly weighed
and canvafle.d by the people, after ieeing the
parts they generally c'iflike, and those they ge
neraliy approve, to fay to them u we fee now
what you with. Send together your deputies
again, let them frame a constitution for you,
omitting what you have condemned, and efta
blidiing the powers you approve. Even these
will be a great addition to the energy of your go
vernment ; at all events I hope you will not
be tfifcouraged from other trials, if the present
one fhouid fail of its full effect. The late re
bellion in MalTachufetts has given more alarm
than I think it fhouid have done. Calculate
that one rebellionin thirteen States inthecourfe
of 11 years is but one for each State in a cen
tuiy and a half, nor will any degree of power
in the hands of government prevent insurrec
tions. France, with all its despotism and two
DrtS ee hundred thousand men always in arms,
has had three infurredtions in the three yea**s I
Paris, Dec. 20, 1787.
I will
have been here, in every one of which greater
numbers were engaged than in Matfachufetts,
and a great deal more blood was ipilt. In
Turkey which Montesquieu supposes more des
potic, infurreftions are the events ojf every
day. In England where the hand of power is
lighter than here, but heavier than with us,
they happen every half dozen years. Compare
again the ferocious depredations of their insur
gents with the order, the moderation, and the
aim alt felf extinguishment of ours. After all,
it is my the will of the majority
should always prevail. If they approve the pro
posed convention in all its parts, I {hall concur
in it cheerfully, in hopes that they will amend it
whenever they {hall find it work wrong. I
think our governments will remain virtuous
for many centuries ; as long as they are chiefly
agricultural ; and this will be as long as there
fliall be vacant lands in any part of America.
When they get piled upon one another in large
cities, as in Europe, they will become corrupt
as in Europe. Above all things I hope the edu
catior of the common people will be attended
to ; convinced that on their good fenle we may
rely with the molt security for the preserva
tion of a due degree of liberty."
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES,
THE writers against government, like the
Pharisees of old, seem to make up a very
good mouthy thanking God that they are not as
other men. It is very probable they are right,
and we may with good cause thank God that he
has not made all other men like themâfor in
that cafe the world would be turned topsyturvy.
These writers affect to be the friends of the
people, champions of republican liberty,and men
of more purity than those who hold offices, or
who wish to support good orderâthat is to fay,
they pretend to be better than the reft of man
kind. If the fun were to shine into their dark
holes, their bragging pretensions would perhaps
expose them to ridicule. In another country,
the garret-fcribbfers talk big as long as they lie
concealed. It would be pleasant to fee their
lean host marfhal'd. Those who give law, as
far as dilating and finding fault will go, to na
tions ; who atfedl to lit in judgment; on kings,
and to fay to power, thus far (not very far)
flialt thou go, and no farther, would certainly
laugh at one another, and themselves if they
were brought together. The thrones of these
gazette kings are placed up three pair of flairs:
they descend from their power when they shew
themselves in the street. This is certainly true
of the greater part of the scribblers in one fo
reign city, and a great city it is. A*, our party
writers have adopted the polite style of their
Grubftreet progenitors, there is room to believe
that they are their peers in rank and dignity.
InlVances are not wanting to countenance the
opinion that some of the most audacious slander
ers of government are not more refpe&able. A
boy of 16 has been known to write political
pieces in a gazette in which he chattered about
men in high otfice likÂ£ a magpie. Besides, men
who have character, are the most cautious how
they attempt to take it away from others. But
the man who never had any, or having had
lome, has loft it, can write abulively against
public men without measure, and without any
feeling to check himâfor he cannot make the
cafe of the man he rails at, his own. He is
more likely than a good man to believe ill of
his adversary, and he can abide him therefore
with a better conscience. For when he fees a
man in a public place, which is exposed to dirty
temptations, he takes it for certain, judging
from his own heart, that he has basely yielded
to them. Let a man, having nothing to do
with the government, but standing impartial,
read the base aspersions which have latelv been
thrown on public men and measures, he will
fay, it he has a good heart, that he had rather
be the fubjecTt than the author of themâhe will
fay that thole hearts which could nurse fuchfuf
â¢ picions, and those men who could publish them
i without proof, have shewn what and who they
an;. Z.

I have always considered the per (on as mimical to good

I Journalfome years ago. But mujl conjefs 1 feel some
\ uneaftnefs for the reputation of the Secretary of State t

if your correfpnndents, as mufl naturally induct a be
lief that Mr. Freneau and his paper are probably re
tained by h'm, with the view of promoting certain po

Either the Secretary supposed that these circumjlanccs

and of little conjequence ; but every public officer oughtÂ»
if poJfibUy on a!l occasions, to condutt himfelf in such

An OBSERVE!!;
FROM THE ALBANY REGISTER,
Mr. Barber,
Through the medium of your paper I beg leave to put
the following queries to the audacious John Cannon,
chairman of a pompous iheeting of fovte licentious
charaders, of the interior counties of Pennsylvania
at Pitt/burgh, the z2d of Augufl, *732.
Query ift. \ S you avow in the lace of the
Â£\. unionâin the face of law, decen*
cy and common sense, your intention of oppo
sing the excite system, do you seriously suppose
that the whole strength of the union, in men
and money, is to be devoted to the protection of
the very counties you aifume to represent, and
that you (of all the people in America) fhouid
dare to oppose jhe government which prote&s
you ?
Query 2d. Do you suppose, that your stupid
rofoives are to influence the mealureiof the na
tion ? Recollect Sirâyou arc not arting upon
the local ideas of a State as heretofore; but
compare your ineafures with a general national
system.
Query 3d. Can you be so mean and short
sighted as to luppofe, that the union at large are
to pay the expence of your protection (which
will cost it more than all your poiTellions are
worth) and that you are to be exempted from
a share of that burthen, to fay nothing of the
direst advantages you receive from the vail
sums of national property which are expended
every campaign among you?
Query 4th. Are you so loft to all fenle of
lhame, as to avow in the face of the world, that
you are so beastly attached to that filthy liquor,
called " whiskey," u that if the excise conti
nues it will bring immediate distress and ruin on
the western country." In your wife preamble
you jefuitically aflert, that you mean to purfus
no other than legalmeajurcs, to obtain what you
call redrrfs; but in your last resolve you give
the lie direct to this assertion, by illegally pro
nouncing u your vengeance against excise offi
cers which the laws of your country have efta-
Llifhed among you ; and declaring all persons
your enemies who have any dealings with them."
Finally, have you the prefumptior. to think,
that the fcnttering inhabitants in the wilds of
two or three back counties of Pennsylvania, are
to di&ate laws to the rising empire of America,
âGâd forbid blush ! John Cannon, and
when you appear again recolle<fl with a little
modesty, that you represent, but in part, a mere
speck on the map of America, and not one hun
dredth part of the inhabitants of the United
States.
Should your daring measures pass by with im
punity, I sincerely hope the reft of the union*
who are paying heavy duties to protest you,
will withdraw their protection, and leave you
to defend your scalps and drink whiikeyat your
leisure. Your western counties have long en
joyed the reputation of being the moll turbulent
and licentious people in America. It is hoped
as education increases among you, that the ri
sing generation will not 6nly enlarge their ideas
on a national scale, but that they will become
more liberal and civilized.

IT matters little to the public who presides
in the Senate : They do not choose to let the
public know any thing about the reasons of
their political conduit ; the public therefore
may trouble themselves little about them, ex
cept it be to watch them with a jealousy, and
try to get rid of them as soon as poflible ; it is
but little good ever they did, and but little
good they can do, but they may do much evil;
there are however valuable characters shut up
in their Divan. We fiocerelywifh them re leaf

THE latt accounts from the army of
PrinceJofeph Poniatowlki,menti
-011 his being now'poiled near Dubuo.
In his march front Oltrog, his rear
guard was continually engaged with
the enemy, by which the Ruffians 101 l
200 men, and otir troops about 40.
Jui.y 13.
We have received accounts here
that the Polirh army under Prince Jo
seph Poniatowfki, near Polonnoc, has
fnffered a great loss from the l(uffians.
On the 7th inlt. the Polish artny,
consisting of 25,000 men, approached
the Ruffians, whole numbers we have
110 accounts of. Prince Poniatowlki
was just absent ; thus the army was
â without a head. The Ruffians no
sooner appeared, but thÂ« Polish Nati
onal troops were immediately struck
with a panic terror and put to flight.
Two Polifl) Generals, either thro'
inclination or fear, went over to the
Ruffians. A reinforcement of 20,000
men for this army was 011 the march,
and it is much apprehended they wilf
meet with the Ruffians unprepared.
The loss of our defeated army con
sists of the whole field equipage, 49
guns, 227 bags of gunpowder, 1475
firelocks, 50,000 cartridges, 24,000
i~ack9 of flour, j,ooo sacks of oats, 2?
cart loads of hay, 2800 pieces of cloth,
470 ammunition waggons, and the
chest of war ; 1737 '"en were killed,
439 wounded, and 1247 taken prison
ers. This affair cost the Ruffians no
thing, iince the Polish army made no
resistance.
On the joth July the King and the
whole corps de rcfer-je that was en
camped in the adjacent diftridts,
marched and fixed their camp in the
ood of Prague (in Poland)
on the oppofire banks of the Vistula.
B RES LAW, July 21.
The report of the defeatofthe Po
lifli army commanded by Prince Po
niatowfki, is not confirmed, and from
the accounts which have been receiv
ed, it feenis to be a falfe one, as they
mention nothing neither" of the ab
sence of Prince Poniatowfki the trea
<oll of one or more of the generals,
or the total defeat of the army.
GLASGOW, July 28.
The new gaol at Ipswich is divided
into four pares ; one for debtors, a
nother for convitfts, a third for felons,
and a fourth for women. They have
separate cells, and are provided with
a comfortable dress at the expence of
the county ; each tfas a bedstead,
ilraw, mattrafs ftieet, blankets, and
coverlid. From the ltrutflure of the
building no gaol dittemper can possi
bly arise, and every priloner on his
entrance is obliged to strip and be
bathed before he is apparelled with
the cloathing of the house ; nor are
strangers admitted to fee them.
PARIS, August 3.
The authenticity of the Duke of
Brunfwick's declaration is no longer
queftioij.ed ; but it has not produced
the union which all rational men
consider as ouronly means ofdefence.
On the contrary, the two pat ties are
as eager in reviling and calumniating
each other, as if they had no common
enemy. To their activity, hi this re
fpe<ft, may, I presume, be attributed
tjie idea of a letter which the Jaco
bins affirm to have been written by
the king to the duke of Brunfwick,
inviting him to Paris, and which the
f euillants aliert is a forgery by the
Jacobins, intended to be produced at
foine convenient opportunity, to de
lude the people, and serve as a pre
text for seizing the whole executive
power into their own hands. It is
our good fortune that these plots, if
they have any foundation in truth
are too much talked of to succeed. '
M. Robertl'pierre moved the Jaco
bins that to save their country there
ihould be a new national
to be chosen by the primary Aflem
blies, to exiit for one year, neither
the Aflemblee Conrtituente, nor the
present Afiembly, to be eligible to it,
and this convention to have the whole
power.
" Another member proposed, that
a Dirtaturate of twentv-one fliould
fupercede both King and Allernbly,
chnfe ministers, appoint generals.and'
conduct the war.
Such are the questions that now a
gitate the public mind ; but 1 fee a
probability in the present tumult, of
order. The Jacobins fay, they have
no more than 45 or 46 members in
the National Alfembly, upon whom
they can depend. All the relt are
either intriguers or touched by 1110-
derantifm ; be it so, we are likely at
least to have a confirmed majority on
one iide, and for the fake of experi
ment, 1 care not 011 which lide ; for
I desire them only to confront their
foreign foes and poflpone for the
term of war ac lcalt, all questions
merely acceflary.
" The National AfTembly to the Na
tional Guards of Paris, and to their
brothers in a'rins, the National
Guards of the several Departments
of the kingdom, come to Paris in
order to repair to the camp at So
i lions, or to join the armies 011 Che
frontiers
" Citizen' Soldiers,
" The Representatives of the peo
ple, whose lively solicitude watches
unceasingly over all parts of the king-
dom, think it their duty to inform
you themfÂ«lves of the dangers that
threaten you. The enemies of the
conllitution redouble their efforts to
destroy your force by dividing it." It
is in the name of that liberty which
you adore ; it is in the name of the
law, to which you have sworn to be
faithful, lhat they have the audacity
to sow so fatal diflentions aniongyou.
Artfully perverting every circum
stance, reviving every prejudice, in
flaming every mind, they ftrive,from
district to diftridt, from division to
division, to lead you on to adtual
crimes, and make you turn your arms
against one another. They want to
introduce among you anarchy and ci
vil discord, those terrible precursors
of defpotifin ; they wish to deliver
you, without defence, to the po%vers
leagued against your liberty, your
independence, and your happiness.
" Citizen soldiers, mark the prec;
pice over which they wish you to fall.
The representatives of the nation
have shewn it to you ; they have 110
more fears on your account. Your
patriotism, your fidelity, the interest
of your country and your own, all
allure them, that apprized of the per
fidious plots against your fafety, no
force will be able to vanquish you,
because 110 fedutfiion will be able to
disunite you."
Proclamation by the King, for the
*' O Â»
maintenance of public tranquility.
" The King cannot fee, withoi
profound indignation, the arts of v
olence by which the public tranquil
ty for several days palt has been dii
turbed in the Capital, individual li

FROM A CORRESPONDENT.
It is positively aflerted, that the people in one
vicinity in the United States, who opposed the
collection of the excise, have never paid a state
tax sinCe the late war ! 'Tis not this, that, or
the other mode of revenue, which they would
oppose, but the payment Of any and all public
dues. Not to execute the laws among such'
people, would be to abandon the maintenance
of civil society, and to reduce a free and civil
ized nation to a state of nature. Mail.
The world is ftrangelv fettered by custom
even in matters which their own senses are dai
ly teaching them to understand. The writers
against the excise cunningly avail themselves of
the ancient aversion to this tax to raise an hue
and cry against the law of Cougrefs. The word
is worth more to their purpose than all the ar
guments they have been able to conjure up.
They carefully remind us of the expression of
the old Congress, that an excise is the abhor
rence of free States, and they add that it is o
dious even in monarchies. But they avoid
pointing out the odious parts of an excise sys
tem. It would not suit their views to confefs
that the law in this country is well guarded
against abule ; that officers are not to break
open houses and the mode of trial is not arbitra
ry nor summary. Will names therefore be fuf
ficient always to scare a discerning people !
Will old prejudice outweigh denionftrative ex
perience ? We have had trial of an excise and
we know it is not the man eater that it was re
presented to be. States most justly zealous
for liberty have had excise laws tbefe forty
years. It is the interest of the people to know
the truth, and every day is teaching them that
an excise is one of the faireft and least oppressive
taxes that can be laid.
Mr. Fenno,
THE writer of the paragraph in your paper
of the firft instant, who mentioned the duty on
nails as being one cent per pound, had reference
to the duty laid by the former law ofCongrefsâ
not adverting to the duty of two cents laid by
the ast which took place the firft of July last.
Mr. DujJlap having called on the Editor
with a request as from the author of the publicati
on which appeared in his paper of Saturday last,*
