IN COMMIT TKK OF THF. WHOLE.
On the Bill providing for the Defence of the Frontiers.
Question under conliderat ion,
AMOTION to itrike out the frcond fedionof the bill, which
contemplates the raising ot three additional regiments of in
fantry, and a iquadron of light dragoons, amounting in all to thiee
thousand and forty men, exclusive of coinmillioncd officers.
In favor ot the motion, and against the proposed augmentation
of the military <ilabliftimcnt, it was urged,
That the Indian war, in which the United States are at pref< nt
involved, was, in its origin, as unjustly undertaken, as it has since
been unwisely and uniuccefsfully conducted ; âthat depredations
had been committed by the whiles, as well as by the Indians ;
and the whites were most probably the aggrclfors, as they fre
quently made encroachments on the Indian lands, whereas the In
dians ihewed no inclination to obtain poffeflion of our territory,
or even to make temporary invaiions until urged to it by a fenle
of their wrongs : a proof ot this un, ncroaching diipofition on t heir
part, plainly appeared in their cor.dust, after the vi&ory they late
ly obtained over our troops; for, when, flulhcd with fucctfs, they
might have swept the country before them, and penetrated as tsr
as Pittsburgh, they contented themselves with the advantage they
had gained over their invaders, and did not attempt to invade our
territories in return, although there was no where at hand a fuffici
ent force to check their career.
The mode of treating the Indians in general, was reprobated as
unwise and impolitic; the Indians are with difficulty to bt re
duced by the fwoid, but may easily be gained byjufticc and mo
deration : and although iheir cruelties are alleged as reasons for a
different condudl, and the fufferings of the white people patheti
cally deplored, these narratives, (it was said) are at bed but ex
paite evidence ; âwe hear nothing of the fufferings of the Indians ;
but if Cornplanter's speech were read, it would fct the matter in a
very different point of view, and furnifti a complete answer to
all the charges of their accusers.
Peace (it was said) may be obtained from the Indian tribes, at a
much less expense than would be ncccffaiy for the lupport of the
war ' âto ptrfevere in hostilities, would be wafting ihr pubjic inn
ney to a very bad purpose indeed ; for (uppofmg our arms crown'd
with viflory, what are the advantages wc may expetf to reap trom
our success ?â-wc can only gain poflcflion of their landsâa pof
lcflion, that must long continue unproductive of the smallest be
nefit, as we already poflefs land fufficient; more, in fad, than wc
will be able to cultivate for a whole century to come.
Instead of being ambitious to extend our boundaries, it would
answer a much better national purpole rather to check the roving
dilpofition of the frontier fetilers, and prevent them from too ftid
denly extending themfelvcs to the western waters : if kept closer
together, and more neatly conne&cd with the old settlements.they
would be more ufelul to the community at large, and would riot
(<> frequently involve us in unneccflary and cxpenfive wars with
the Indians : but if permitted to rove at pleasure, they will keep
the nation embroiled in perpetual warfare, as long as the Indians
have a tingle acre of ground to r< ft upon.
If the citizens of the United States were recalled within their
proper boundaiies, there thev might, for years to come, cultivate
the foil in peacc, neither invaded, nor invading. As the country
progrtlTes in population, and our limits are found too narrow, it
will then be soon enough to contemplate a gradual extension of out
fiontur : but in the mean time, it is an idle profufion of blood
and treasure, to carry war beyond our present line of forts : it is
only exposing our arms to disgrace, betraying our own weakness,
andl lelicning the public confidence in the general government, to
fend forth armies to be butchered in the forefts, whilst we fuffcr
the Britilh to keep poflVfljon of the posts within our teiritory.
As long as Britain is fuftered to retain those posts, wc can never
hope to f'iccetd against the Indians; nor ought we to trace our
late misfoi tune to any other fouree than her still holding them in
her poirtflion : were they in our hands, the Indians could not car
ry on their operations against us with the fame degree of vigor as
thev now do ; for it is from those forts that they obtain their Ap
plies of arms and ammunition, with which ihev'can be, at all
times, plentifully fu*nifhed, as long as things continue on their
present footing.
Until thole posts are'n our pofJVflinn, it will be vain to fend
our ;tmirs into the wildernefi. A body of five thouland met.
lent out agairift the Indians, under the present circumflances'
would be as ettefluallv defeated as the fmallcr ones have already
Been : in those wilds, our troop, have nofrier.dat hand, to lurmlh
â¢ hem with lupphes or to g,ve them intelligence of the app.oach
and operations of the enemy ; whereas the Indians, receiving ho'h
Â«.d and information fâ¢ theie friendly netghbprl, can pre-co!,-
cert their plans, and chufe, according to their own convenience

from a third expedition of the fame k' 7 flal,e . rin S P rof P cft
mon- J,,i ~ki fame kind : it was thought much
4du,C4b ' c 10 co, " cm ourfvlves with defend,n S the frontier ;
and this might be done, without making so great an augmentatior
in the military eftablilhmenf.
The only use of regular''troops on the frontier, is to gariifon the
forts, and to have a (landing (oicc in the neighbourhood, to form a
station, to which the inihna may relent either (or protection or
supplies: but as to aÂ£lÂ»ve feivice, the fiouiicr militia and ranger'
were pionounced to be by far pieferable to the regular troops, as
hcing more expert woodfmcn, and belter habituated to the Indian
mode of fighting. To defend the torts, a small number of regu
lars would befufficient; the present ettablilhtnent of two regi
ments would, it gompleated, be amply adequate to the purpose;
and when ailifted by such forces as might at all times be colle&td
on the frontier, would be able to repel every inroad of the enemy.
Experience has proved, that the sudden and desultory attacks ot
the frontier militia and rangers, are ever attended with better fuc
ce/s than the methodical opi rations of a regular fo r ce ; the former
air beiter calculated for expedition and furprile, making unex
pected sallies, fcouringthe country in small bodies, harrafliug the
Indians, and intercepting their draggling panics, by whom their
motions are unobieived ; whereas, when a body of regulars take
the field, encumbered with baggage and heavy artillery, the una
voidable slowness of their movements affords the enemy an oppor
tunity of watching all their opeiations, colliding their whole (orce,
and (kuiking in the woods around them, till they can seize t he fa
vorable moment to ftnke a sudden blow, which they generally do
with fucct fs, but which they could never attempt, if exposed every
hour tÂ» the unforefeen attacks of our woodsmen, who would keep
their attention conflantly engaged in all quarters, and thus pi event
them from uniting in large bodies.
It was further ohf< rved by some gentlemen, who even admitted
the propriety of invading the Indian teiritory, that toeffc&ihis
with success, it was by no means neceflary to make such an cn
cicale in the militaiy edablidiment, as that contemplated in the
bill: the mifcarria'gc of the former expeditions could not (ihey
said) be alledged as a fufficient reason : fqr it is well known, that
the former edablidnnent was far from being complete : the regu
lais, for the service of the lafl campaign, were to have
been above two thousand two hundred ; the President was besides
empowered to raise two thousand five hundred levies in addition
to the regulars; and thefewould together havecondituted an army
of about four thjufand seven hundred incn : had such a body
been employed, we might have expelled much better
fuccrfs against the Indians, whose numbers were so far inferior,
the whole force of the Wabafh tiibes not amounting to above ele
ven or twelve hundred warriors, who never could keep the field
for any length of time, but mud be soon obliged to disperse, with
out venturing an attack upoji an army of such superior drength.
Infirad of this, our army confided of only about twelve hun
dred men, and of these not above tour or five hundred were regu
lar troops : bcfidi $, had even this foice been fuflicif nt if employed
in season, the delays, that had taken place in the execution of
the plan, would alpnc have been fufficient to defeat the intended
purpose. During the winter, the law was paffc-d for laifing the
additional troops to carry on the war with greater vigor; the
w hole summer was spent in the butanefs, and the few men that we
did enlist, were not raised till late in the fall : collected at length
at the hca<l of the Ohio, they fiuitleftl) loitered away their time,
till they finally crctted a monument to our eternal disgrace and
infamy.
Whatever troops arc to be employed, ought to be raised with
diligence and dispatch, if we wilh to avoid a similar milcarriage
in our next attempt : the aimy ought not to enter the Indian
country, till their whole farcr is completeâdifficulties however
and delay, equal to those of Â§ril year, may be expeÂ£lcfl in enlist
ing the men and we shall have the officers in pay a considerable
time, without any soldiers : perhaps the former pay of the troops
was *00 low ; and proper effe&ive men weie unwilling to ac
cept of it ; if so, let it be raised ; let the men be well clothed and
fed; and they will moie leadily engage in the service : probably
also the term of three years was an objc&ion with many, who
would otherwise have joined our ftandaid : if enlisted only for
fix months, the rank* will be sooner filled ; and this ought to
have considerable weight wilh those who advocate the augmenta
tion of the military eftablilhment, as they cannot but know, that
if we set about cnlifting the number of men contemplated in the
bill, and in the manner there prescribed, they cannot be raised
time enough to render any service in the next campaign.
The information, contained in the repct on the table, was not,
it was faidf to be implicitly relied on : that report was made by a
man, who had not personally visited the frontier : oiheis, who
had been on the spot, were of opinion, that if 2000 levies had
been laifed last year, they would have been fnfficient not only for
the defence of the frontier, but even for any oftenfive operations,
that might have been thought neceflary : such troops, colicftcd in
the vicinity are more competent to the undertaking, than the
troops now in contemplation : no complaint had been made of
their conduct; whenever they were tried, they benaved as well
as the regulars, and in the adiion under General St. Clair, they
gave eqnal proofs of their valor.
It was farther urged, thar the frontier mi'itia are not only equal,
but infinitely fupenor to any regular troops whatever, for the de
fence of the borders, and that they are in fad, the only force
' hat can be effectually employed in expeditions againff the hostile
Indians., whofc mode of fighting is familiar to them, and docs
not ftnkc them with that degree ot terror, with which it inspires
those men whoenlift on the regular eftablifament : âthese latter
being colledhd in the heart of populous cities, where the face of
an Indian is seldom leen, hardly know, whether the Indian and
his horse are not the fame animal : and when thev approach the
enemy, at the very firft shout, even before he is in view, they are
terrified at the idea of savage barbarity, which they have ever
been taught to refl;Â£l on wrth horror ; and being incapable of ie
filtance, they commit their fafety to flight. To prove the supe
riority of the militia, gentlemen need only contrail the dispatch
and success of the expedition conduced by General Scott, with
the delays, disgrace and mortification which attended that und r
General St. Clair, and consider the difference of the cxpence on
those two occasions
The expence of such an army as the bill contemplates, is an
objcCt well worthy ot fei ious consideration, efpectaliy at the pre
ftnc moment, when thete is fcaicely a dollar in the treasury.
Gentlemen would also do well to'advert to the progress of this
bufmefs, and consider where they were likely to Sop, if they
went on at the present rate : -at fiiff, only a single regiment had
been raifcd, and the expense was about 100,000 dollais ; a second
was afterwards added,v/hich swelled the expense to about 300,000;
and now a standing force ot 5168 men is contemplated, at an an
nual expencc of above a million and a quarter. Can this be juf
tificd in the present ffate of our finances, when it us well known
329
[Whole No. 291.]
that the Secretary of the TrealYiry, having been requefled by the
members from a paÂ»ticular State, to build a light-hotife on a part
of their coast, declined the undertaking, and alledged the want
of funds, as the reason ?
Our resources however might be made to answer for the sup
port of such a force as that, whiclji was intended [or the service of
the prectding year, and there would be little complaint or diflatis
fadion among the people : very few murmuring* were heard a
gainfl: rhe former establishment : but such a one as is now con
templated, will be thought extravagant, will breed discontent
the citizens of the United States, and perhaps afford our
neighbors in Canada an opportunity to take advantage of our di
vided fttuation, and involve us in a war more dangerous than the
former which ieparated us from "Great-Britain.
Apprehensions (it is said) are entertained, that the objeÂ£l con
templated in raising those additional troops, is not so much to
punish and coerce the Indians, as to have a (landing regular force
equal to what the British have on this continent. This is said to
amount to about fix thousand men, including those in Canada :
but it is to be remarked, that the British nation has not above one
ihoufand men within the limits of the United States ; and yet
with this handful of troops, they not only keep the Indians in
awe, but even, in opposition to the wishes of the United States,
retain pofledion of those ports, which (hould have been ceded to
us pursuant to the terms of the treaty :âwhy then is it necessary,
lor the purf>ofe of establishing pods and garrisoning them, to en
creafe the (lauding force to so large a number, as that contempla
ted in the clause under consideration ?âDuring our late arduous
druggie for liberty, when we had to cope with the mod powei
lul nation under heaven, the commander in chief had never at
any one time above ten thousand men, under his own immediate
command ; and if with so small a force, we were able to cft'eÂ£l so
glorious a revolution, there can be no neceflity of going such
lengths at present, for the fake of edablifhing a military charac
terâit is drange policy indeed, to raise five or fix thousand men,
to oppose a handful of Indian banditti, whose utmost amount does
not, from the documents on the table, appear to exceed twelve
hundred.
We arc pieparing to squander aw-.y money by millions : and
no one, except those who are in the secrets of the cabinet, knows
for what reason the war has been thus carried on for 3 years : â
but what funds are to defray the encreaff d expense ot maintaining
such a force as is now contemplated ?âThe excise is both unpo
pular and unp">du6live :âthe impoil duties have been raised as
high as is confident with prudence : to incieafe them would
be but to open a door for smuggling, and thus diminish their
produ&ivenefs : and if those sources of revenue fail, if our finan
ces be thus exhauded in unneceflary wars we shall be unable to fa
tisfy the public creditors, unless recourse be had to new taxes,
the consequence of which may, with just reason, be deplored;
wheieas, if we but keep our expences within bounds, if we nurse
our finances, we (hall be refpc&able among the nations of the
earth, nor will any nation dare to insult us, or be able to do it
with impunity.
During the course of these observations, an honorable gentle
man asked, â¢whethrr this was a day Tel apart for rhetorical flour,
ilhes, as the galleries were open, and he law the short-hand wri
ters Rationed at their different posts ?
At an early stage of the debate, an honorable gentleman had
suggested, that, in (lead of pafling a law for raifmgat all events
the additional regiments, which, for his part, he did not think
neceflary, the house (if they finally determined the present efta
bhlhment to be inefficient) would perhaps do better to appro
priate a certain futp of money, to enable the executive to call in
such additional aid,as circumstances may require.
To this it was objected, that it is the duty of the reprefenta
tivcsof the people m all appropriations of the public money, to
make them lor certain fpecific purposes ; âto ast otherwise on the
piefent occasion, wpuld be fctting a precedent,that might, in its
consequences, prove highly injurious : for, although the grsateft
confidence may fafely be reposed in the virtue and integrity of
him who now fills the presidential chair, it is irnpoflible to fore
fee what use may heieafter be made of the precedent by his fuc
ceflors, or how far it may be canicd.
Against the motion for striking out, and in favor of the propo
sed augmentation of the military eftablifbment, it was urged,
That as to the juftiee of war carried on against the Indian tribes,
that was a question which could not admit of a doubt in the mind
of any nun, who would allow that felf pVefervation and indis
pensable necessity arc fufficicnt caufcs to' juftify a nation in taking
up arms :â if the present war be not in every refpeft juftifiable,
then there never was, nor ever will be a just war : it was origi
nally undertaken, and since carried on, not for the fake of con
quest, but to defend our fellow-citizens, our friends, our dearefl
connexions, who are daily exposed, in the frontier fettlemeuts,
to all the rage of savage barbarity, to which they, with their
wives and children, mud soon fall viflims, unless we speedily
fly to their afliftance :âand alt hough there are some people, who
utterly deny the juftiee of any war whatever, this do&rine, how
ever fine in theory, will hardly ever obtain in practice : for, is it
to be imagined,that any set of men arc of such a paflive difpofiuon,
as calmly to look on, whilst their friends and relations are butch
ered before their eyes, and to refute giving them every afliftance
in their power ?
The muiders and depredations, which have, for years past,
been repeatedly committed by the savages, loudly call for redrels :
âfrom various documents of unqucftionable authority, now in
the hands of the Secretary at War, signed and attested by the exe
cutive and legislature of Kentucky, by the diftrift judge, and
the captains of the militia, it appears, that from the year 1783 to
1790, there have been, of the inhabitants of that diftrift, or of
emigrants on their way thither, rto less than fifteen hundred per
sons either mafTacred by the savages, or dragged into captivity ;
two thousand horses taken away ; and other property plundered
or destroyed, to the amount of fifty thousand dollars ; and there
is good reason to suppose, that on the other frontiers ot Virginia
and Pennsylvania, r .he number of persons murdered or taken pri
soners, during the abovementioned period, would furuifh a lift
of one thousand or fifteen hundred tAore.
The white people, it is true, have sometimes committed depre
dations on the Indians : but the instances have been rare [the ho
norable gentleman who spoke, did not recolleÂ£l above one or
two] of their making unjuit attacks upon the savages, nor did they
on thole occasions commence hostilities against them, till exaf
perÂ«ned-by the ffrongeft provocations, that could poflibly ffimu
late the human heart : t his circumstance mav be justly allowed as
lome palliation ot the offence :âeven in these instances, however,
a tew individuals only were concerned ; and when the affair
came to the knowledge of the State, ample reparation was madero the. injured party the general government
too had (hewn an equal difpolui.oll to do jultice
to the Indian tribes ; wit net's the affair of the
Cherokees : for as soon as Congress had heard
their of an encroachment made on
them by some of the people from the frontier of
the Carolina, immediate orders were ifluedl for
obliging the intruders to evacuate the Indian
territory.
But notwithflanding the disposition that pre
vails as well in the legiflatuies of thole States
whose frontiers are molt exposed, as in the ge
neral government, to cultivate peace and amity
with the neighboring Indians, that desirable ob
je<ft is become utterly flnattainablein the present
Jiofture of affairs : â The frontier Indians have
killed a number'of whites ; the whites, in their
turn have made retaliation : both parties are in
the highefl degree exasperated against each o
ther, and likely to continue so, in spite of eve
ry endeavor that can be made to effect a recon
ciliation : with minds thus irritated, it is vain
to hope for peace, as loyg as they continue in
each other's neighborhood ; it is therefore ne
ceflary to form a strong barrier, to keep them
asunder, unless indeed the advocates tor a cefla
tion of Jioftilities would oblige the frontier set
tlers to abandon tlieir lands :âbut by what
new-invented rule of right, should the inhabit
ants of Kentucky, and the other frontier set
tlers be laid under a greater obligation, than a
ny other citizens of the United States, to relin
quish a property legally acquired by fair pur
cbafe ?âwere it even proposed to pacify the sa
vages, by purthafing the lands anew, such a mea
fore would answer 110 other purpose, than tliar
of procuring a temporary peace, which would
soon again be interrupted by a war, that would
reproduce the necessity of again having recourse
to the fame'expedient : we should have to pur
chase the lands again and again without end ;
by thus squandering the public money year af
ter year, we should only swell the national debt
to an amount, that we cannot pollibly forefee :
âbetter at once to make a vigorous effort, to adl
in a manner becoming the national dignity, and
to maintain our ground by war, since we can
not obtain a durable or an honorable peace.
Attempts have at various times been made to
treaties of peace with the Indian tribes,
with wham we are now at war:âand although
these efforts havÂ» conltantly proved ineffectual,
they yet {hew that neither the United States, nor
the state of Virginia, were backward on their
part to adopt conciliatory and to do
away that animosity whjch had commenced on
the part of the savages at an early period of the
late war with Britain, and had continued to break
out at intervals ever since. In theyears 1783, 84,
87, 88, and 90, offers of pcace were made to
them : on the last mentioned occasion, when a
treaty was proposed at the Miami village, the In
dians at firft refufed to treat: they next required
thirty days to deliberateâand in the interim,
the inhabitants of Kentucky were exprefly pro
hibited by the President of the United States, to
carry on any offenfive operations agaiutt them ;
yet notwithflanding tnis forbearance 011 the part
of the whites, 110 less than 120 persons were kil
led or captured by the savages, and several pri
soners roasted alive, during that ftiort period, at
the expiration of which, the Indians refufed to
give any answer at all.
On another occasion, riie Indians, not content
with rejecting our pffers of peace, proceeded even
so far as to infulc us, by telling us, we have lands
within the British ports, and alking us, why we
did not go and take pofTeflion of them ?âWill it
be said, that we are unable to do it ?â Is this lan
guage to be used within the United States ? No !
we an able, abundantly able to do it, whenever
we please : and if we would but retrench our
expenses in some instances, which might well ad
mit of a reduction, our ability would still en
creafe : our finances are not quite so inefficient
as some gentlemen seem to imagine, nor foeafily
derangedâwe are still able to prove that the
boasted efficiency of the general government is
fomeihing more than an empty nameâwe can
yet raise both men and money fufficient todefend
the nation from either injury or insult.
It is now too late to enquire, whether -the war
was originally undertaken on the principles of
justice, or not: âwe are adtually involved in it,
and cannot recede, without exposing numbers of
ipnocent persons to be butchered by the enemy ;
for, though we fhcaild determine to discontinue
the war, can it be said that the savages will alf}>
agree to a celfation of holHlities ?â it is well
known that they are averse to peace ; and even
the wirmeft advocate of pacific nieafures must
therefore allow that the war is a war of neceffiry,
and must be supported : we cannot, without im
peachment both to our jullice and our humanity,
abandon our fellow citizens on the frontier to
the rage of their lavage enemies : and although
the excise may be foniewhat unpopular, although
money may still be wanted, what is the excise?
what is money when pat in competition with the
lives of our friends and brethren ?
A fuffieient force inuft be raiTed for their de
fence : and the only question now to be corii
dered is, what that force shall be : experience
has proved, that the force employed in the lafl
campaign, was inadequate : it is true the elta
blifhtiient wns not complete : but who will ven
ture to aflert, that, if if had been complete, it
would have been fuffieient for the intended pur
pose ? Are gentlemen, who aflert this, so well
acquainted with the circuniftances of the enemy,
as to be able to give an accurate liatement of the
amount of their forces on the frontier.' There
are higher opinions in favor of an augmentation
of the army, than can be adduced againlt it
opinions, given by men of judgment and experi
ence, who have themselves been on thefpot, and
are well acquainted with the situation of affairs
in that quarter: âthese gentlemen, who tnuft be
allowed to be competent judges, are decidedly of
opinion, that the prefenc ellablifhtnenc, though
completed to the last man, will not furnifh an
adequate force to carry on the war with effetft ;
and that it will be a hopelels attempt to open
allot her campaign, with le/s than about fivethou
fand regular troops, the number contemplated
in the bill.
Nor ought that number to be deemed extrava
gant, under an idea, that we have only a con
temptible handful of banditti to contend with :
their numbers were, lait year, si om authentic
documents, Itated at about 1200 warriors, from
23 different tribes â¢ âsuch was the opposition then
contemplated , âbut it is impossible to ascertain
what acceliions of strength they have since re
ceived, or even what force they had engaged in
the late unfortunate action ; as the very men,
who were in the engagement, do not pretend to
Torm any jtifl oraccurate estimate of thenumber
of their allailants : but there is good reason to
suppose, that they had previously entered into
an aflbciation with various tribes, that have not
as yet cotne within our knowledge : thebwwsand
arrows, used againfl our troops, 011 that occasion,
afford a convincing proof, that they had foes to
encounter from diilant nations,as yet unacquaint
ed with the use of fire armsânor does the ac
count of the bows and arrows depend, for its au
thenticity, on newspaper evidence alone ; gen
tlemen of unqueltionable veracity, who were per
sonally engaged in the action, have declared,that
they had theinfelves noticed the arrows flying.
When we consider the warlike disposition of
the Indians in general, and the alacrity, with
which the victors are ever sure to be joined by
numerous allies, we have every reason to expert
a much more formidable opposition in rhe next
campaign :âit is well known, that the favuges
place all their glory in deeds of war ; and that,
among them, a young man cannot make his ap
pearance in company, till he has signalized his
valor by some martial archievement :âwhen, to
this powerful incentive, a new ftimulos is added
by the trophies obtained in the late action, it is
presumable that numbers will crowd to thei\-
ftandaid ; and it strongly behoves us to prepare
in time for,a much more vigorous effort, than
any we have as yet made against them.
The objections drawn from the encreafed ex
pense, mult entirely Vanish from before the eyes
of any man, who looks forward to the confe
quences of one more unfuccefsful campaign : â
such a diltafter would eventually involve the na>
tion in much greater expense, than that which
is now made the ground of oppolition : â better
therefore at once to make a vigorous and effec
tual exertion to bring the matter to a final ilfue,
than to continue gradually draining the treasu
ry, by dragging on the war, and renewing hosti
lities from year to year-.
If we with to bring the war to a speedy and a
happy conclulion, and to lecuve a permanent
peace to the inhabitants 011 the frontier, we
niuft employ such troops, and adopt such mea
sures, as appear belt calculated to enfuie success :
âif we delay our determination, unt.il the force
of the enemy be ascertained, we can make no
provision at all : forthe nature and circumrtanc
es of the cafe preclude us from the very poliibi
lity of obtaining a knowledge of their rtrength
and numbers :âbut are we, mean while, to re
main inactive and irrefoluie, and make no efforts
to repel their intended attacks ? No! Whatever
their numbers may be, prudence calls aloud for
provision of lome kind : and if experience is to
have any weight with us, the example of the
rench and of the British points out the true
mode of securing our frontier, and rendering it
invulnerable to an Indian foe : let us occupy
ports in the vicinity of the enemv ; let them be
properly garrisoned, and well, "provided ; and
the business i 5 done.
These will afford an opportunity of trading
with the fi iendly tribes, and will prevent all in
tercourse between the whites and the Indians,
except under proper regulations : fliould hofti'
lines be meditated by any tribes who are not in
aniitv with us, early intelligence of theii move
ments, can be obtained : their marauding par
ties may be either beaten off on their approach
or lnteicepted on their return
330
may be taken of separately attacking the hostile
tribes : thjeir old men, their squaws, their chil
dren , will be exposed a great part of the year
whillt the others are out hunting in fhorr if
sfear, hope, interest, can be supposed to have any
iufluence on the Indians, this mode of defence
niufl be allowed to be preferable to any other
as giving the fnllelt scope to the operation of all
those motives.
A different mode has been long pursued in Vir
ginia, and adopted by the inhabitants of Ken
tuckey ; but its success has not been such, as to
offer any inducement to the general government
to follow the fame plan :âRangers have there
been employed for a number of years, to scour
the frontiers ; and those rangers, too, were ex
pert woodsmen, perfectly inured to-the Indian
mode of warfare : yet notwithstanding their ut
ruolt vigilance, the savages (till found means to
commit all the murders and depredations already
enumerated : â 'tis true, however, that a frontiiÂ«r
militia man, trained up in the woods, may be, in
many refpetfls, preferable to a l egular soldier,
who has not the fariKe knowledge of the country,
and of the mode of fighting :âbut with equal
experience (and proper men, poflefled of that
experience, tnay beenlilted on the establishment)
regular troops will be found infinitely superior
to any militia upon earth.
Every man who has ever seen militia in the
field, cannot bat know, that a very triflingdifa!-
ter. or a flight cause of discontent, is fufficientto
make ihem disband, and forget all subordinati
on. so far as even to negleift the means of felt
defence ; â whereas regular troops,under proper
discipline, and acting with greater fteadiuefs and
concert, are much more to be depended on, es
pecially when the objec't of attack is diilant, and
great fatigue is to be undergone. The militia,
in whatever mode they ma)' be called out, will
hardly furnifh' men of the proper description :â
if large pay be offered, the temptation wiil e
qually prevail upon those who are unfit for the
service as it will upr>n good effective men :âbe
fides, foine of the states have no militia laws;
and even in those states which have such laws,
they are gone into disuse : no dependance cau
therefore be placed 011 tnilitia, under any laws
now exifling :âthere is, indeed, a general mili
tia law now before the house : but if it ever
pafl'es, it certainly cannot be pafled indue season
to answer the purpose of providing for the â¢.in
mediate defence of the frontierâregular troops
mull be raised, or nothing effectual can be done:
âand if to avoid the expense we refufe the only
aid that may prove of any real service, we render
ourselves responsible for the consequences of this
parsimonious policy, which may be attended with
the'ruin and deftrutftion of our fellow citizens
in the wellern country.
The Cornplanter's speech was again mention
ed, and called for : but, as it had been confiden
tially communicated by the Prelidenr, au objec
tion was made to having it read, without clear
ing the galleries ; âwhereupon,
An honorable member arose, and mentioned
his having read it in one of the public newf'pa
pers in the ltate of New-Jersey.
To this it was answered, that if any gentleman
had the newfpaperto produce, the speech might
be publicly read from that : â otherwise, altlio
it might be very proper that the speech iifelf
should be read, yet, as it had been confiden
tially received from :he executive, there would
be a manifest trefpals on propriety and decorum,
in having it read with open galleries : âit was
therefore wished, that the galleries might be
cleared.
The parliamentary etiquette requiring that
this should be done by the house, and not by a
committee, the committee rose for the purpose ;
and,
Flie Speaker having resumed the chair, the
lotion for clearing the galleries, was renewea.
An objection was here started, by an honora
jle gentleman it. favor ofthe augmentation,who
(aid, that, as some gentlemen had spoken oil the
popular fide of the qu&rtion, whilit the galleries
had been open, it was unfairto preclude tholeot
opposite fentinients from an opportunity ot an
swering their arguments in the fame public man
ner, and proving to the people the justice, aim
necefiity of the war.
The motion, however, was perflated in, and
the galleries were cleared.

Mr. White and Mr. Moore opposed the

011 the law for preventing stage plays, and other
theatrical entertainmentsâ" That it was not ex

opposed, in a sensible and judicious fpeecli, by
Mr. Tudor ; Mr. Gardiner delivered an elaborate
and learned cflay to prove it confident with the
principles of christianity and good morals, and
Dr. Jarvis displayed ihe blaze of eloquence in a
speech, pure, forcible and refinedly ingenious.
Yet all this, enforced by observations from other
gentlemen, and not opposed by any other speak

accepted the report by 99 votes out of 143.
Philadelphia, February 11.
The Briti/h December Packet arrived at New-
York on Tuesday lait. Accounts by her, are re
ceived to the beginning of December.
Lord Cornwallis writes from India, that he had
attacked and totally defeated Tippo before Se
ringapatainâbut on account of the Monsoons set
ting in earlier than usual, he found himfelf ob
liflied to retreat to Bangalore, without making
an attempt on Tippoo's capital.
The English and Parisian articles of intelli
gence, are to the 2d DecemberâThey refer prin
cipally to the movements of the counter revolu
tionistsâsome in a ridiculous way, others more
serious. No decisive lteps appear to have been
taken by the ex-princes.
ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS
The people have seldom cause to feai\that ac
cusers of their government will be wanting.
The rifle is, that a sudden and patfionate censure
will be paded upon their rulers. The pleasure
of the people is often opposed to their interest.
Public men are at least apt enough to yield to
the love of popularity. The greater danger is
that they will want firmnefs when great things
are to be obtained by disregarding little ones.
It concerns the people therefore todealont their
censure sparingly ; and never till enquiry has
firft been had. In that cafe, many men whoj>of
fefs virtue, but want firmnefs, wiil dave to serve
the public faithfully.
Every thing has its seasonâThere is a kind of
fafhion in the turn of writing, oil political fub
jetfts especially, which every warrior of the quill
is fond of following. He likes to step to the
tune that is playing : when the government
was firft adopted, they came forward in ranks,
keeping time to the music ; What a ble[fedgovern
mtntâwhat a wife government âthe -wonder of th?
world ; public credit will be protest
ed, we shall be a nation, ire.âthen the tune chan
ged againâThis government wants amendments
without amendments 'tis a terrible government, a ty
rannyâhrdfhipi will be as thick as taverns, and we
321
Adjourned till Monday
shall get as much intoxicated with themâThe amend
ments, like cold -water, -will keep us temperate and Co
ber. After the fir ft Congress met, what salariesâ
what a burden on the countryâthe public debt will
not oe paidâthe money all goes Jor Jalariesâtrade is
taxed tÂ» deathâthe land is ready to Jink under the
weight oj taxes, which are not laid to pay themâthe
wheat will blajlâthe grass will not growâtte ships
will not fail-the tide will not rife, becaufc of high sa
laries. The second fefiion of the firft CongVefs
brought a new fy flein of grievances into fafhion
IVhy does Congress hear Quaker petitions, andnegleft
providing for the public debt Pâwhy is it notfunded ?
âthe public creditors are jlarvingâCong) ej sis trow
ing fat in Jloth aud good pastureâwhile the time is
loft in making and hearing Qilaker frmons, for aud
against flavsry. The debt was funded':âout
rushed an angry tribe of writers, crying, rogues
and cheatsâCongress hat cut of the jyft demands of
the creditorsâ 4 per cent, in/lead of 6âand one third
of the debt 'deferred jor ten years, without interejt.
The state governments pursued the idea, and
made up the deficiency to their creditors.
That tapic was worn out, and then the oppofue
dodtrine was taken up : â Congress has given too
muchâthe public creditors are living in luxuryâsuch
a flood oj wealth will drown usâWhat will btcomeof
all this sea of money Pâlnduftry will turn lounger
economy will keep open doorsâvirtue itches to take a
bribe, and republicanism has loft her voice, and is
choaking with her own fat. IVe might have gone on
without funding the debt and mortgaging the reve
nuesâw; pay too much to the creditorsâ we might
have paid the debt e after âwe might have paid it with
out paying, and have kept our money and our tem
pers, and have had no taxesâand all this we miÂ«ht
have done, and have kept our credit as good as it was.
Now the Indian war seems to have beaten the
debt, and the lordfliips, aud the Quakers, and
the amendments, as soundly as it has beaten the
brave St. Clair, and his army. Nothing but the
Indian warâHow cruel to kill the Indiansâhow
joolijh to jend regular armies, which will not kill
them. Poor humanity is ready to die of grief, be
cause you take their landsâyon seek their lives', and
advifs to fend volunteers to kill them all. It is
not flrange that a fubjetl should be left as soon
as the public is tired of it; âbut the curiosity is,
that one fide of it should be taken, and then the
other, so that the accusation may never lanauifli.
1 find by reading tbe papers, that CongrefsÂ°is al
ways in the wrongâit errs by forbearing to act,
as well as by acting :âand if the advice of the
complainers is followed, they turn about to the
other fide, and condemn them for having done
it. Is the public opinion nndeadyâor are there
a few men (a few can make a great noise) who
lie in wait, and l'eize every opportunity, Speci
ally public disasters, to make the people hate the
government as bitterly as they do themselves
" Between two stools wp are likely to fall to
the ground."ârThe people found the state go
vernments incompetent to the prefervatipn.of the
Union, or the support and encouragement of
their trade, a criculture,& manufactures ;
it is a late discovery that the general govern
ment is equally incompetent to these objedis, par
ticularly in regard to the two laft.âlf we are
thus circumstanced, our boasted sovereignty and
independence are but empty founds.
How different have events turned out from the
predidions of those who opposed the funding
fyftein ! âHave any of the Ethiopeans changed
their Ikin ?âLet recent publicationsanfwer
