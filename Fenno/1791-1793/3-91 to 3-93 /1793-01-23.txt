LONDON, November 8.
THE rnagiftratcs of Frankfort weie for ex
torting the whole of the contribution from
the Jews only. This brought on a remonstrance,
not to those mean and contemptible tyrants who
had long infultcd and pi.laged them, hut ro the
French General, who very properly interfered,
and not only prelerved the Children oj Ifraelirom
â this last ast of opprefÃon from an infclent and
illiterate magistracy, but procured them an im
mediate restoration to those rights of which they
had been for ages iniquitoufly and wantonly de-
prived.
The jews are now restored to the rank of
manhood at Frankfort, and enjoy all the rights
of freemen, to the no small mortification of their
purfe-pioud opprellors, who no longer presume
to elbow the persecuted race, and exclude them
the peifecuted walks.

Extract of a letter from Loudon, dated
the 12th of November laj},
" I am sorry to find tjiat 'your
lace speculations in the American
funds have not been so favorable as
you wished and had a right 10 ex
pedl ; the price here hashad little
variation since my last, but I would
advise you by no means to despair
of their turning to a proper account
ere long : 1 ground this opinion
upon the best information, and you
may reft afl'ured that the American
Government and their National
Charader are growing into great
estimation, and the surprising in
crease of their refonrces which are
known here to every man of the
finalleft information will establish
yonr Public Credit ; and (hortly
place it on a footing with that of
any other governmentâThe dis
contents prevailing in this kingdom,
and particularly in Ireland, fill
many of the monied people with
disagreeable apprelienlions ; and I
know already fonte who have turn
ed their eyes towards your funds ;
and have it certainly in contempla
tion to place their money capital in
them, which they will certainly do
if the public mind becomes a little
more agitaied ; at any rare, yon
may, I think, with fafety count up
on a considerable rife, as there feeins
a great probability of peace taking
place between the powers at war on
the continent.
" The King of Prnflia will cer
tainly change his fyfteni as it re
gards France, and ir is not doubted
that the Turks will he prevailed up
on to declare war against the Em
peror, and likewii'e the tyrant of
Ruflia. Should the former continue
his hoitile difpolition, and the lat
ter a<Jl offenfively towards that re
public, it is well known that the
Turks, aided by the marine of
France, will be very formidable to
these two powers in that quarter of
their dominions, and make fuchim
preffions on those despots as may
give a fatal blow to their greatness.
" These circuniftances are well
known here, âwhich, together with
the new order of things, will have
a proper weight with the bellige
rent powers, and incline them ie
rioufly to pacific measures; iu which
sentiments they will be aided by
this country, as well as Spain and
Portugal, for very wife reasons.
Upon the whole, I think it de'mon-
Itrable that either peace or war
will rife the credit of your stocks,
much beyond what they have ever
been in this country."

Mr. Fen no,
IF you regard your own profit, or the enter
tainment of your readers, you will make an
immediate and total reform in the conduct of
your Gazette. Your profit depends on the falc
of your paper, and the sale of it depends on its
being adapted to the taste of your customers.
The majority of men is composed of readers
who are following their private affairs, and who
care not a sous !or politics. There are
antis who hate every thing but such slander oti
.Congress men as will give vent ro the bile that
i.s choking them. There arealfo a few zealous
federalifts who fuffer perpetual fears for the over
throw of all order, which they know would re*
joice the hearts of the leaders of the anti-fa&on.
â Now, Sir, is it not manifeft from this mode
of clafling the newspaper readers, that prsife,
however modest and well deserved, beftoved
on the government and its officers, affords no
sale for your paper ? Most men hale to hear any
praise but their own. No, Mr. Fenno, turi a
boutâSpice your paragraphs with (bnder on
the Onjrrcfs men and officers of government.
It will (barpen the flomachs of your readers.
Your papers will be fought after and read vith
avidity. Where is the harm even if you fliain
the truth a little, to get at themâlf they betave
well, the dirt will not (lick.âlt is doing fcnice
to the cause of virtue to slander those who are
devoted to its precepts. The good example is
made the more conspicuousâ Fill your pa>tr
with abuse if you expect to fill your pockt'js
wiih goldâTo vindicate the measures of govern
ment is an uphill bufmefs, which tires you a*d
your readersâBut the contrary being downhs,
is rather a lecreation than a task. A goverfk
mrnt the most prudent may sometimes commjt
mistakes, and then you will be compelled to
own t ; and if you know any palliation, to fuj -
geft it, which is a difagjeeable thing But f
you make war on a ministry, and pay little moje

Congress does good, it is with a fly intention

Be advised by a friend, Mr. Fenno, and as

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, January xo.
S letch of the Debate on the Resolutions refpefling the
Lean of the Balances due from the United Stales
to the individual States.
(CONCLUDED.)
Mr. Clark said, when the resolutions were
ftrft proposed, he thought no obje&ion would
be made to them ; but he had heard fomethipg
which had alarmed him, and that was, what
fell from the gentleman from Pcnnfylvania, tljat
there would be no debtor statesâthis, he said,
alarmed him, as it appeared to convey an idea of
the commifiioners for fetling the accounts, hav
ing adopted the principle ; this, he conceived,
they were not authorised to do. He further ob
fcrved, that he did not think with those who fyp
pofed that the deciTions of the commiHionfjr
were nÂ»t to be revised ; he was pretty sure they
would be revised, if they adopted any such
principle as this, which he considered as as in
volving great injultice.
Mr. Fitzfimons rose to explain; he said he
was misunderstood; he had not said there would
be no debtor ftatesâDifferent principles of fet
ling the accounts have been mentioned, but he
had not said whether the commifiioners would
fettle the accounts on the principle of debtor and
creditor states, or make them all debtor or all
creditor states. He had only givep his.q/uniin
that there ought to he no debtor states. The
question now before the committee is, whether
the United States (hall pay the states in their
corporate capacities, or pay the individual ere
270
ditors. He cor.ccived the gentleman was total
ly mistaken in his opinion refpeSing a reviiion
of the judgment of the commifiioners ; the law,
lie said, had put that entirely out of the power
of the legiflatiire- . ,
Mr. W. Smith said, that he conceived the pre
sent proprofition had nothing to do with the
the question refpefling debtor or creditor Hates;
it relates (imply to a provision for the sums due
to the individual creditors of the several states,
who are really creditors of the United States.
He noticed the objecftion from additional taxes;
no difference, he contended, would result from
the measure, the balances are to be provided for
at all events. Th>t the present was the best time
to take up the business, he observed, was well
argued by the gentleman from PenÂ»fylvania, in
addition to which he thought the allusion to the
state of affairs on the representation bill by th;
Sentleman from Maryland was direitly in
point; the difficulties on account of the ratio
were encreafcd, when the result of the eenfus
was known ; and this would be the cafe if this
business should be postponed to the time when
the accounts are fettledâHe therefore contend
ed, that the present was the most proper time to
make the provision contemplated. Mr. Smith
noticed in order, the various obje&ions which
had been made by several gentlemen, and con
cluded that he trusted, from what he had said,
it would appear that the proposition was entire
ly dear of those difficulties which had been ur
ged against it.
Mr. J.Â»ivermore moved an amendment to the
firft resolution ; the obje& of which was to ex
onerate those states, who on a final adjustment
of accounts shall appear to be debtor states.
Mr. Gerry offered fame objections to this a
mendment.
Mr. Ames said, that the amendment appear
ed to him irrelative to the fubjedt now under
consideration; he hoped therefore, the gentle
man would be induced to withdraw it.
Mr. Madison observed, that when the a
mendment was firft brought forward, he had
supposed it merely sportive; but it nÂ©w appears
that the gentleman is serious in moving it. He
thought it in this view a proposition that might
well excite attention, for he conceived it an ex
traordinary idea to be advanced, that any of the
states who lhould be found debtor states, should
be released from all obligations to pay.
Mr. Sedgwick offered various observations on
the fubjeft generally; the tenor of which was
this, that however it might appear on the final
adjustment of accounts, that there were sundry
debtor states, yet it was hardly pra&icable to
devise a mode of compelling payment from such
states; nor could he colled it to be the opinion
of any gentleman, that an idea of compulsion
was entertained by any one.
Mr. Livermore said, his motion was not un
derstood; he had no idea of exonerating the
debtor states in the manner suggested by several
of the gentlemen who had remarked on it; by
the explanation he gave of his motion it appear
ed, that his objedt was the apportioning the ge
neral charge, and to exonerate the debtor states
from any demand against them, on account of
the credit they were entitled to as members of
the union, not to release them from their full
proportion of the average charge of prosecuting
the war.
Mr. Mercer said, he was more and more con
vinced that there was to be no debtor (fates;
the proposition from the gentleman from New-
Hanipfhire lays so; the resolutions origiaally
moved, speak the fame language; the report of
the secretary of the treasury is founded on the
fame principle.âThe meaning of all which is
burn the books.
Mr, Clark moved, that the commifiioners for
fettling the accounts (hould be inftruiftcd to re
port a statement of all the debts and credits of
the several states. He reprobated the idea of
making all creditor states, as he conceived the
consequence would be a great encreafe of the
balances to be provided for by the United States.
The question was adjourned till the next day.
TUESDAY, Jan. 15.
The Petitions of ihc officers of me lÂ»te army
being under confidcration in committee of the
wholeâthe following motion was made by Mr.
Gerry, viz.
" RefoTved, as theopinion of this committer,
That provision be made for such officer?, non
commiirioncd officers and soldiers of the late ar
my of the United States, who received certifi
cates for the balances due to them on a final set
tlement of their refpettive accounts. Provided,
that such provision shall not exceed the ditf. r
ence between the nominal amount of the said
certificates, and the real 4thAmu, eftimaied at
the piel'em rates in the market, of the cHtificatis
which are or mav be iffiied for thole fir ft menti
oned, pursuant to an ast making provision for
the debt of the United States."
Mr. Clark moved an amendment, which was
to insert in the fiid clause after the word " fni,"
all per/on s who have received liquidated ct' tificales
jorfervices rendered or Jupplies Jurnjhtd during
the late war, and.
On i his motion to amend, Mr. Hartley made
the'following ohfctvationsâ^
I wifiied that a qurllion upon the prayer nf
the petitioners might he fairly taken, without
any'embarfafTmem 01 Conncftion with another
--
Let us consider and difcufsthe claims of the
officers and I'oldicrs ol the late artny, and either
grant them, or dismiss their petitions with de
ccnry.
The gentleman from New-]erfcv yrflerdav
came forward with a resolution, cxprefling that
the ptaver of the pet'tioners could not be 'grant
edâlf this was confident with his opinion, it
was candid âhe appeared openly to avow his
fentinunts I cannot fjy quue (o much in his
fav'ir to-dav, lor withdrawing his motion.
Indeed, the motion p.eftnt'ed by the gentle,
man from MafTachufetts. comes lorwaid'... so
queflionahle a (hape, that lam a , a !âf, know
who arc lnentlsor tnernieito the ohj. 6\â ol the
petitioners. J
To adopt the proposed amendment. I consider
as death to the motion on the :alUâ,t embraces
ton much âit eontrm pUtn whit the aWlitin Â»f
hi* country arc nut competent to.
I hope u will not be agreed to.
The officers and foldicrs attempt to (hew that
there is a diftin&ion between their cafe and o-
cheÂ« citizens ; bcfidts what they have to hopt
From the bounty and magnanimity of the nation.
It may not be amiss ior me here to mention,
that I have never had a certificate, and that I a m
not personally intereftcd in the queition â1 *aÂ»
an officer part of the war, but have nothing
aflc for here. I consider that the otficcrs
soldier? have a clainnof jufticc as well as equity,
besides what they might expect from the magna
nimity of the nation.
I ffiall fajf but a few words on the. fuffcrinÂ«
and diftrefc of the aimy; thry wcr* , nd
u< #/ampled in the history of mankindâThoic
who are now prcfent, and wcie eklirt in thcea.
binet or field, mutt know the fotce of my ob.
fervation. I will not detail the fceneaot mist.
ry exhibited during the war.
To fuppoit the rights and libertiesof thecouc
try,officers and foldien freely entered into the
' fcrvice âIn the year 1776 the officers, had half. *
pay; in the year 1777 the pay was nominally in. |
creased. but unfortunately depreciation came 00,
and their a&ual compenfaiion was less than tba.
year before.
T have a refpefl for a militia-man, bin his cafe
cannot becompaicd in point of difficulties aud
danger to that of the officer and folderâthe
former occajiooally called forthâthe latter con
stantly at the post of danger and duty. Thore
was certainly an inequality in their
which ought to have been qornpenfated lor to
the soldier.
The officer who was married, though hecouJd
meet the dangers of the field yet could
not view with fortitude the poverty and misfor
tune which threatened his family.
Congress had made no piovifion to grant half
pay to the officer* (who fhouid serve to the end
ol the wai y nntil~fbiftr time itfrtrc yegr i /7ftâ â
Several officers who were well attached to the
catife, owing to their necrotics and thecircum
fiances of their families, were obliged to resign.
The commander in chief saw the evils which
threatened his country and the army ; he stated
them to Con<rrefs; fomeftrdng promises and apv
pearances werr ahfolutcly neccffary on the pat t
of government, or the army wouTd rut be kept
together. Thcfe were made in rUe most soli rt n
manner. Many officers and -foldte*s were re-
tained
Depreciation fli:1 conuriuedâThe soldier,
hungry and forlorn, wtsoW'geri to take the pa
per that was offered him by the government.
This was not in general thecaCe with the farmer;
the latter moll commonly parted will) his pro
pert*' voluntarily.
One kind of paper followed another during
the war. Each depreciated ; hut itill Congrefc.,
by repeated resolutions fin ordpr to induce the
officers ?nd foldiersto remain at their port) en
gaged that they fbould be compensated at the
end of the war.
Certificates oF different kinds were iflfued ;
and I belfevc Cotngrcft artd the whole American
world, exue&ed they were to be paid in tyfccie
as fo#Â»n as theie wsWltiy tjr
vernment. And I l\illthirik there is a differ
ence between their claims and thofeof the other
citizens.
At the firft feflion of Congress ander the pre
sent government, the House resolved that they
would fupportthe public credit ; ?nd Urongex
prcflions were used. This gave great confidence to
the public ; certificates were enhanced in value,
and many of them had puffed into the hands of
strangers, under the faith of government; fothat
when the funding bill pafled, nothing could be
done without the consent of the holders.
I wished exceedingly for an opportunity to
give mv aid in favor of the officers and loldiert
who had served to the end of the war.
It was a voluntaty ast in the holder to fu". *
his debt at about four per cent, and it appeais
there is a considerable saving to government out
of ihe earnings of* the officer and soldier, and
which may fairly and honorably be granted to
them.
I mean to reach this. Those who concur with
me in sentiment, to be againtfc the amend*
ment now under consideration, and assist to alter
the motion so as to embrace the objects we have
in view. f Deba't tn be comtjiiurd.)
FRIDAY, January 18.
A report on the petition of Ezekiel Scott,
in favor of the petitioner, was read, and" laid
on the table.

natiori<;. A bill for determining the northern
boundary of the territory ceded to the United
States, by the state of North-Carolina ; and a
bill to regulate trade and intercourse with the

on laid on the table a few da\*s since by Mr.
Hartley, was referred to a committee of the

bring in a bill, providing half pay for 7 years

may hereafter be killed in the service of tbe
United States.
In committee of the whole, on the bill to
compensate John Tucker*
Mr. Key, in the chair,
Mr. Sedgwick moved to fill the blank with
509 dollars. Mr. Tucker's petition stated
that his actual expenses in attending on
court five different times, amounted to three
hundred dollars, and that he paid nine dollars
for a leal for the circuit court of Rhode-lf
land.
The motion was opposed ; it was said that
it wouldeftablifh a dangerous precedent for
the government to pay the voluntary expens
es of an applicant for an appointment under
the United States ; and that in the present
cafe the aftnal services only ought to be com*
pen fated according to the provision made by
a fubfecjuent law. In reply it was said that itÂ».Â»as taken for granted Mr. Tucker had sp
oiled for the appointment, but no evidenee ot
fhis is adducedâfevera! circumstances were
mentioned to Ihew that the contrary was the
fact and that he was called to discharge the
dutVes of the office. The question is, whe
ther he ought not to have his necelfary cx
pences incurred in attending the courts re-
509 dollars was fuperceded

to. The committee role and reported the

to the navy board for the Eastern Depart
ment : the question on agreeing to this refo
lutionwas put and negativedâthe committee
rose and the chairman reported, that Ihe
committee do not agree to the resolution.â
After fame observations this report was dila

100 dollars, and a bill ordered tP be brought
in. ,

The causes offpewing out of wheat, areâ
FirjlâToo much moisture in the foilâand,
Secondly, Frost. The remedies are, to avoid
sowing either wet or four, or springy foils;
and to ditch, trench, or water furrow fuf
ficiently those fields the fanner fufpefts in
either of these particulars.
Manuring well, is also an important, arti*-
cle ; but when the evil has taken place, let
him not forget to roll his wheat as early in
the spring as convenient, after his fields are
dry enough to admit of Ht: This, and a good
top drefiing of ripe manure will revive and
strengthen the roots which wpuld otherwise

COMMUNICATION.
Liberty is order. It is to society the law
of its nature, and ought to afford to this ge
nerated the fr.me certainty that the next
will be fre?, that we now have in the win
ter, that the spring will cloathe the earth
with green. Instead of this order, this per*-
fiction of reason, our high-flying scribblers
who care as .little as they know about the
principles of liberty, make it consist Dot in
order, but innovation, change, anarchyânot
in calm reason, but pafiioti, emotion, and ex
travagance. They applaud a wild ranting
fury, and call it the tiiie spirit ot freedom.â
It is well this is not true. For excess cannot
last long, and liberty, initead of being fafe and
durable, would be the most uncertain thing in
the world. What paflion gives to-day, it may
deitiolilh to-morrow.âOur anti-federal scrib
blers condemn permanent laws and fvftems,
to secure liberty, property, and order for ages.
They had rather lee the government of the
people, and its most r.ccefTary infhtutions,
adapted to the pailions of the day. A wife
nation will prefer such regulations as secure
permanency. It is worthy of the cauie of
freedom, and it is expe&cd f. om this coun
try, whose example is already precedent and
authority, to Jhcw that monarchy is not more
stable, more orderly, nor more efficient, than
the Freeflt government in the world. Liberty,
by indicating health and vigor, promises long
life. â¢ Our fcribbiers would fedtice her into
excess and debauchery, which would produce
diseases and death.
The world has been too long governed by
opinions which owe their influence to their
antiquity, more than to l heir intrinf.c justice
âThat government is neceflary to the en
joyment of freedom, and all its concomitant
bielfings, must be conceded on all hand.âbut
that the true interest of the governed and tlie
governors is infcparable, is a truth that man
kind have been flow to learnâ though hifloij
confirms and expcrieuce is inculcating it eve
ry day.

gro Man called Isaac, about twenty-three
years oid, five feet fix or eight inches high, a
well made fellow, fond of talking, has a large
mouth, and his teeth very much when
talking ; had on when he went away, a brown
linen shirt, a (hort white kersey over jacket with
a very high collar and plain breast, with buttons
which appear lo have been very gay ; a pair of
white kersey breeches, a pair of white knit yarn
stockings, a pair of shoes with firings in them,
and a hat ; all ihc above clothes are al
ipoft new. Said Negro was fprmerly the pro
perty of Mr. William Thomas, late of Kent
County, near George-Town Cross Roads, de
ceased, and has for several years been employed
in that neighbourhood, and principally by a Mr.
Maxwell, and lately by Messrs. John and James
Carmack, as a waggoner, which business he is
well acquainted with, and is what he prefers ;
and has been engaged in driving a waggon from
said Cross-Roads to Duck-Creek, &c. until
August last. I expect he will make his way for
the neighbourhoods of George-Town, Duck-
Creek, Dover or Wilmington. The above re

so that I get him again. He is an artful fellow,

object worthy the attention of any person who
withes to invest money in a property that mull

central situation to each place. The Potowmacfc
