APTKOVED, MARCH THE FIRST, 179".
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT is curious, ss well as ufeful, to observe the
changes which induflry has effccfied. Italy is
at prefeiit rich in silkâyet, in this very country,
during two liiriulred and fifty years fioin the time
of its being firlt known in Rome, it was fold for
its weight in gold. Jr was not till many hundred
years after silk was known there, that the (ilk
worm was introduced into Europe from China.
In the year 551, two Monks were employed by
JuJUuian, the Emperor of Constantinople, to bring
the eggs of that ufeful infecft. This'they acconi
pliftiedâand the rearingof (ilk-worms has spread
into several countries, and at last is beginning to
be an object of attention in some parts of Ame
rica. It is more than twelve hundred years since
the (ilk-worm was brought frpm China to Europe ;
and one would naturally suppose that there is
nothing further remaining to be done towards
extending thte culture of (ilk to places where it
is not yet introduced, or improving it where it is
already praÂ«ftifed. Yet fjhis inference, however
natural, is invalidated by two remarks. The
progress of the culture of silk has been extremely
(low, and late experience has proved that it may
be extended even to northern climates. Dear as
silk was, and eager as the trading world was to
get it, it appears that it was near seven hundred
years after the (ilk-worm was brought to Con
(tantinople, before the culture and manufactory
of silk was e(labli(hed even at Venice. It was
(lowly spread from place to place on the (bores of
tli,e Mediterranean. The experiments made in
our own country have universally succeeded. It
appears that the hatchingof the eggs maybe de
layed, artificially, till the mulberry leaf is ready
forthe supply of the young artists. The cold of
our seasons leeins, in this manner, to be obviated
without expence
There is a fore of prudence which condemns
lew schemes as viiionary, and which no doubt
deprived ten generations of this prudent race of
the advantages of this culture in Venice, and
â¢other places near Constantinople. There is 110
doubt that had the culture of silk been haltened
and foftered by the patronage of governments,
and of enlightet.ed nations, it might liave been
advanced a thousand years ago as far as we fee
it at this day.
The result from these remarks is, that the fuW
jecft of the culture of silk deserves the attention
of the governments and people of America. His
tory Ihews us how little was done for agesâand
our own experience proves that more may yet be
done. The southern states leem to be belt situ
ated for it, but the attempts made in the north
ern ftiould be also patronized and extended.
LONDON, January 7.
THE finances of Sweden are 111 such a ruinous
fituatlon, that the King finds himfelf under
the neceflity of convoking the States. His Ma
jesty, still perseveres in his in
tentions in favor of the French Princes ; for all
the officers of the army have received orders to
remain with their regiments ; no leave of
absence is granted on any pretext whatever.
No less than seventy Swedish merchantmen are
at prefenc in the Mediterranean : the late rup
ture with Algiers therefore fills the merchants
of Stockholm with great uneasiness.

The town of Seringapatam, in the East-Indies,
(since the mafl'acre and plunder of Delhi by Na
dir Shah in 1737) is now considered as the lar
gest, and by far the molt wealthy town in India ;
it contains the accumulated wealth of a long line
of affluent princes, and the iniinepfe trenfiires of
Tippoo. It is situated upon a long island in the
Caveri river, and connected with the' main by an
immense bridge : its defences are not naturally
Itrong. The Caveri, like most of the rivers in
India, is fordable at all times, except during the
rains, at which period the (trength of the place
becomes considerably increaled. The rains ge
nerally commence about the end of May, and
break up in July.

Yrfterday morning at eight o'clock the house
of the Duke of Richmondj in Privy Garden,waÂ»
discovered to be on fire.âBefore the engines ar
rived, the flames had got to fuc'i a height that it
was a considerable time before they could be in
any degree reducedâbut fortunately the firehav
ing broke out at the top of the house, an oppor
tunity was thereby afforded of getting out uie
molt valuable furniture in the lower apartments,
which was removed to places of falety in the
neighbourhood.
It is with much pleaftire we learn that the Duke
of Richmond's valuable museum did not fall a
prey to the flames during the late fire. âHad it
been destroyed, it would have been almost a na
tional loss, for the collection is one of the molt
splendid in Europe.CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE of representatives,
W 1 DfsESDAY, Feiruaky 8.
hi committee of the -jjholt, on the Fijhery Bill.
On the motion to iti ike out the words l( bounty now allowed,"
and 10 inferx ' ailowaiice now made,' &c.
"jVT R - GILES observed, tliac he conceived the
-LVJL vote of yesterday againit fti-iking out the
firfl fedtion, was a decision in favor of the poli
cy of granting governmental aid to the fiiheries ;
the inquiry of to-day will be 011 what terms this
aid /hall be granted ?
lie felt, he laid, but little regret at the deci
sion of yelterday, because he had himfelf pre
vioutly contemplated some reasons, not unim
portant, to jnflify that decision, ancl others had
been luggeited by several gentlemen in the course
of .he debate : The principles of this policy,
lie thought however might be combated by rea
sons of at lead equal, and as far as he was able
to judge, of paramount importance; but as he
admitted r.onfiderable weight in the reasons on
each fide of the question, he was not particu
larly tenacious of the preference which his own
opinion suggested. When he firfl mentioned his
doubts respecting the principle of the bill, it was
with diffidence, and those doubts in some mea
sure arose from an idea that the bill contained a
direct bounty upon occupation ; upon a more
minute examination lie thought tjie term bounty
unneceffiirily introduced into the bill, and that
the objetfi of it could be anfvvered without the
use of terms, which might hereafter be deemed
to contain a decilion upon the general principle
of the conditutional right to grant bounties ; it
was to avoid any thing which might wear the ap
pearance of such a decision, that induced him to
make the present motion.
He proceeded to remark that as great a dif.
ference of opinion often exilled refpedtir.g the
precise meaning of the terms used, as the conse
quences which flow from them after attaining
such precision of meaning ; and it is of impor
tance to the present difcufiion that an accurate
definition of the terms used in the bill, and those
proposed to be used, fliould be had.
The avowed object of the bill is not to increase,
but to transmute the sum or a portion thereof
now allowed to the fifheries in lieu of the draw
back upon fait, from the merchant who is now
supposed to receive the sole benefit, to the fifh
ermen really employed in the fifliing veflels :
I his is a mere chimerical project, but if it be ad
mitted that this is the object to be effected by
the bill, the term bounty is improperly applied.
A gentleman from Maflachufetis (Mr. Antes' l
who rests the defence of this bill almost folelj
upon this position, that those who receive the
benefit intended by it, are of right entitled to
such benefit in consideration of a previous ad
vancement in value, and that this bill contains a
nteie permission to them to retain their own, has
at the fame time declared, that he thought' the
term bounty the most proper and technical, to
convey this ideaâin this, the gentleman appears
to have deviated from his usual accuracy. A
bounty is the granting a benefit without a" cor
-1 efpondent return in valueâa drawback is the
retaking of lomething in consideration of a pre
vious advancement ; this is always founded up
on a consideration pteviouflv receivedâthat is *1
grant of favor ex mero motn. '
But the great charatfteriftic diflinttion between
bounties and drawbacks as they efl'entially relate
to the adminiltration of this government, con
-1,1 tilc governmental objects to which they
may severally be applied : Drawbacks are ne
ceflarity confined to commercial regulations
bounties ma y be extended to every pofiible object
Â»>i government, and may pervade the whole mi
nutia of police, they may not only be extended
to commerce, bat to Wa/ai, agriculture, ttiaun-
Jaatjre j and even the fast tine ft of religion will
ue found too feeble to furnifh complete protec
tion from their influence. The people of the
United States have always been scrupulously te
nactous of a conilitutional security for the mofl
free and ec-un! exercil'e of this right, but through
t>ic mcu'jjmit bounries even this right may be
mvac.eJ, and the only security againit such in
valion innft be governmental discretion.
1 he fame chÂ»radteriftfc difliniftion will attend
that Jpectei of bounty which may incidentally
relult from commercial regulations; and direct
01111 tics i.pon occupation founded upon the broad
bafts o( di.c; euonary right : the fpecification in :
the ccnfhttuion of the right to regulate com- 1
merce, way pofilbly in fctne cases give rife to '
this indirect species of bounty, not from any
right in the conltitution to gra,nt bounties,/but
as the necelfary result from tlie fpecified right to
make commercial regulationsâand this fpecifi
cation can be the only foundation of juftification
ro this ihdireot species of bounty, but there is no
fpecification in the coultitiition of a right to re
gulate learning, agriculture, manujatturcs or reli
gion, and so far as the sense of the constitution
can be collected, it ratherforbidsthan authoi ifes
the exercise of that right.
Aigunients used to deduce any given authority
fiom the term general welfare, abiiractedly from
the fpecification of fotne particular authority, are
dangerous in the extreme to rights constitution
ally i eferved, and ought ever to be viewed with
! g reac caution and suspicion ; they serve diredtly
to fliew that this government is not only consoli
dated in all its parts, but that it is a consolidated
government of unlimited discretion, that it con
tains no constitutional limitation or reftriJiion.
If any given authority }>e inferred from the
term general welfare in the abftrsuft, any other
authority is equally deducible from it, 'because
the term is applicable to every poflibie object of
government, and differs only in degree, as to
the several governmental objects.
He could not fee the force of the novel andcu
rious distinction taken by a gentleman from Con
necticut (Mr. Hillhoufe) between general weljare
and particular weljare ; for every particular wel
fare however minute, maybe in a degree for'the
general welfare, and if the- decision refpeiting
the existence of this diftinttion, have no other
limitation than congreflional discretionâit is e
qually deltruitive of all confth'utional rellraint.
Gentlemen who have advocated this principle
of conltru<tion, appear'ftartled at forne confe
quetices fuggelted to result from it, and have de
nied that they have made the admiflion of such
consequences ; this is true, nor have tbofe in re
ply so aflerted, but they have taken up the prin
ciples of construction furnifhed by its advocates,
and made the application of it to the consequenc
es which they themfdves infer ; and if the prin
ciple be admitted, it is undeniable but that the
conclusions drawn from it will necefl'arily follow
in their utmost latitude.
A gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr. Barn
well) confidently spoke of the inherent rights of
this government ; this is a new source of aucho
lity, and totally inapplicable to this government
if there be inherent rights in governments at
all, they mull belong to governments growing
out of a (late offociety, and not to a government
deriving all its authorities by charter from pre
viously existing governments, or the people of
those governments. In such a government, the
exercile of every authority not contained in the
lnftruinent, or deducible from it by a fair and
candid conltruciion, is an nnjuflifiable assump
tion j}nd usurpation.â-He did not mean, he said,
to analife this fubjetfi further at this time, and
had been led into thefegeneral remarks, because
the impatience of the committee to have the
question upon striking out the fecftion, had caus
ed him to refrain from delivering ih e f e senti
ments at that time. '
He would remark further, that bounties in all
countries and at all times have been the effect
of favoritifin , they have only served to divert
the current of industry from its natural channel
into one less advantageous or productive ; and
in fa<ft they are nothing more than governmen
tal thejts committed upon t'he rights of one part
of the community, and an unmerited governmen
tal munificence to the otherâ In'this country and
under this government, they present an aspect
peculiarly drsadjul and dejor?ued.
I To contemplate the fubjetSs upon which boun
ties are to operate in the United States, the na
ture of the government to dispense them, the
date preferences which now do and will forever
â¢more or less, continue to exist, the impoffibilicy
of an equal operation of bounties throughout the
United States, upon any subject wha'ever, should
beconfidered ; and one of these two effects will ne
cellarily follow the exercise of themâeither 'the
very exidence of the government will be dedroy
ed, or its adminidration ui 11 it be radically chamr.
Ed it mult be converted into the molt complelc
lyitem of tyranny and favoritifin.
. He observed, that it is not unfreqiient at this
time to hear of an eaflern and southern interest,
and he had tor some time filcntly and indignant
ly leen, or thought he saw, attempts by this mean
to influence the deliberations of this House upon
alinolt every important question ; so far as be
was the inliilted objedt of tliefe attempts, he felt
that contempt for their authors, which appeared
to him to be the correspondent tributeto theim
punty of their designs s yet he thought that this
had been the molt formidable and effectual ,ni
mfttrial machine which had been yet tifed in the
adii'imftratton of the government. Butoneo-reat

LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Feb. 24.
A lingular letter was presented by Amos Butterick, a Shaker
praying that government would receive bark the fecunties &c'
â which had been granted him, as a pension for the loss of an eye in
the iervice; declaring, at the fame time, that he could not confei
entioirfly keep it, nor receive any gratuity ; which was read and
committed to the hon. Mr. Hofmer, Dr. Euftis.and Mr.Johiifonâ
who reported, that the applicant have leave to depofif.tie money
&c. in the treasury, and that it be fafely kept for him.
â¢ There is 2 seasoning in wit, frequently to be found in the most
simple expreflion. On Wedncfday, a young pirl asked, what
ihe firing and ringing were for ? For Gen. Washington's Birth
"Day, was the reply.â" What again," faj s she, " /thought they
kept if a Jortmght ago but recollecting herfclf, " Ifibbok
fayÂ« the, " He is so great a man, that he was horn twice."
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
TPHE attemp(|jof the persons in the gallery on
â A TlNirfday last, to manifeft their approba
tion of what was doing in the House of Repre
sentatives of the United Stares, by clapping their
hands, was too suddenly checked by the marks
of severe displeasure which appeared on the part
of the House. It :night be said, with more truth,
by a part of the Houfeâfor proper exceptions
are always to be made. But why fliould not the
House fuffer the people to express their sense ?
They represent the people it is trueâthat, how
ever, is in the quality of substitutes for those who
cannot attend in pofon. Those of the people
who are prefeijt in the gallery, represent them
selves 5 and with the members, atSing as attor
nies to those who are absent, the whole is repre
sented. And so things go as merrily as at an
horse-race, by Ihoating and clapping of hands.
Who will not prefer this mode of doing business
u C j C ou '' s t " le gallery in conjunction, to
the dull nutcracking, apple-pairing, drowsy hum
of their ordinary proceedings ?âWe talk oftlie
ienfe of the people. But this, on the old plan,
Js mere t,alk : by the addition of the gallery, the
advantage is doubledâwe have two sensesâat
lead we have added besides the sense.
The sense of the people exprefled at a distance,
gets cold before it reaches Congress. But if
ongrefi can be made to do as the gallery woi)ld*
have them, it seems clear that they will be made
to obey the sense of the people. This, it is true,
would throw a burden on the flioulders of the
people of this city. But, fSr the fake of their
diltairt fellow-eitizens, they ought not to refute,
especially as it would give those whom they t>b-
Jg e great pleafnre and fatisfa*fiion,'and increase I
the confidence reposed in Copgrefs. Nay, if the
1 rant iVates fhdiild happen to negle<ft chufing
members, or they fhpuld negle<si to attend, things
Would gdon iwitnhlingly notwithstanding. The
gallery would fep to them. The Senate keeps
its doors ftiut,,â and seems to believe that a dell
eiative aflembly may deliberate without a gal
y* It seems easy to prove the very contrary.
- Sal'ery may goyerri very well without an af
lembly. They did so at Athens ; and if a fellow
*Â»as n Â°Â«yÂ» or too tall to size with his townfnien,
'ey flurtfened bim by the head, or sent liini to
1 In oanifhrnent by the ostracism,
The Oppofuion to clearing the galleries was
very fit and Ojtoper. no doubt it could be
ihewn tjiat was unconstitutional. If
not from the conftituuon, at lead ther<? is a di

" When we entered the Ouabaclie river it was lull of floating
ice, Major Hamtramck with whom I came, had about 5 o men
: we had 170 miles to ascend the river in this situation, and we had
but ten days provision. About 200 Pyankefhaw Indians, who
had beard of the defeat of the army, and that their prisoners were
hanged at Fort-Waftiington, fell in with us; wfc happened fortu
nately to have two Indians with us who had been up to Fort-
Walhington' to fee their friends, who were taken by Gen. Scott
and Gen. Wilkinfon ; these two informed their brethren, that
their prisoners had not been hanged, as had been told them', but
were well treatedâthis pleased them. But still we apprehended
they might wilh to take some prisoners which they could offer in
exchange for their wives and childrcq, and there were three or jour
of them for one of us. To account for it, I cannot, but the fa a
is, they were very kind to us, gave us plenty of frefh meat, and
all the afliftance they could in coining up. God grant they may
always continue in this difpofuion."

THAT elegant SEAT at the Fall* of Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in New- J rfey, occupied for many years part, by
tlie fublcriber ; containing upwards of 200 acrcs of land, befjdes
\ tract of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the 11ftin street leading from
Trenton to Lambertoji. and Philadelphia, into two pans, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The othir
oart, bounded by the laid street on the east, and by the river on
the weft, forms a fquate; which, from the combined effect of fili
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the moil
'..eautiful and desirable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-fmifhed brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing view of
the riv r, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new stone
coach-house and ftablrs, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining these is a very complete granary,
rat proof, and a stone cow-houle, upwards of 100 feet in length,
containing thirtv-one paved flails, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, &cc. Adjoining the court-yard ot Ihe tnanfion-houfe, is a gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
hte of culture, and abounding with a iich colle&ion of the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large asparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of tbe square, is a new, well
h ult, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheese-room,
fvn ing-house, garden, &c. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
ribs, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
ce.f ry out-building. The ground is properly divided into small
fields, all well watered, highly improved, and chiifly under the
most aporovrd grass. This square has produced annually, tor se
veral years past, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, besides
supporting through the summer season twenty to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or-
I ;hards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper seasons,
I with great pi nty of all kinds of fi(h usually found in frefh water
tn this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl ; both of which
may afford a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is inclofcd and divided
lÂ»y good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar posts,
and rails of chpfnut and white cedar. The purchaser may have
the improved fquaie feparate'.y, or the whole together, as may
best suit him. There is an inexhaustible quantity of good build
ing stone on the river shore. The purchase money, if well frcurcd,
and the inteieft punctually paid, will not be demanded foi main
\ ears.
