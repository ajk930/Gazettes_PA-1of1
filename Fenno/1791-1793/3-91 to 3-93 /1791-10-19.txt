ORIGINAL ADDRESS.
TO THE PUBLIC
AT this important crisis, the ideas that fill the mind, are preg
nant with event# of the grcateft magnitudeâto strengthen and
complete the union of the Statesâto extend and pro.their
commerce â to explore and arrange the nationalfunds âto rcttore and
eftablifb the public credit-â will require the energies of the patriots
and fajres of our counv yâH:r.ce the propriety of cncrc&fwg the me
diums of knowledge, and information.
AMERICA, from this period begins her national cxiftenreâ
l( the world is all BEFORE hek " âthe wifHom and tollyâ
the misery and profpeiity of the empires,flates, and kingdoms, which
have had their day upon the great theatre of time, and are now no
more, the mod important mementos âthese, with the rapid
leries oF evt n'B. in which our country has been involv<d, have
taught the enlightened citiz-nsof the United States, that Jrecdcm
anil government, liberty and law*, are mfeparable.
This conviction leci to the adoption of the new conflitution ;
for however various the sentiments, refpe&ing the merits of this
system, all good men are agreed in tne nectlTny of an efficient je
itral government.
A paper, therefore, upon national, independent, and
impartial principle fâwhtchfliall take up the pre mi Ted articles, upon
a competent plan, it is presumed, will be highly inierefling,
â¢nd meet with public approbation and patronage.
The Editor of this publication is determined to leave no avenue
*>f information unexplored :âHe foliciu the afiiHance of peifonl
ofleifure and abilitiesâwhich, united with his own afliduity, he
flitters hinifelf will render the Gazette of the United States not un
wortjtv encouragement and is, with due refpett, the
public's humble servant,
April 15, 1789.
POS ISC RIFT,
THE plan and execution of the Gazette of the United
Sr at es, have received the app- obation ol a tribunal, from which
the r e is no appea'.
The subscriptions, which are encrealing, have long finre exceed
ed the expectations of the publisherâa punflual compliance with
the term-s would compeniate his labours, and animate his tuture
exertions.
The Government th?t an enlightened and free people adopt, is
sacred confideranonâit knows no party âand its prosperity is
"founded on the public g^od.
While the people are just to themselves, the adminiflraÂ»ion of
their affairs will be committed to m<*n of integrity and competent
abilities; and it will be the dutv of patriotism to lmprefs the pub
lic mind with favorable sentiments of the mcalu.cs ot govern
ment.
Our country continuing enlightened <md free, the period can
wot be anticipated vÂ»h;-n a publication on the plan of this Gazette
fcall involve a dereiifiion of thofc principles with which the li
berties and happiness of the United SttWes are connected.
With rcfu vt t-.Â» the circulation of this paper, the Editor regrets
tnerecent difapr ointments which have unavoidably taken placeâ
He has always been fully imprtflTed with the importance ot punc
tuality. and cannot charge lumfelf with a si *i;lc inltance of rc
mifTnc fs. Â° b
It is vrrv generally supposed that Congress, at the enfning
icluon, wr!l take measure* to ensure the circulation of news
papers i n the V.. :cd States; and particularly their tranfitiiffion
roin the Scat ol Government to all parts oÂ» tnc Union. Jullice,
policy -inri p rioiifm, plead irrefutably in favor of fotne etfedual
provision's ng made. The following pertinent and judicious
obfWv.vions on this fuHje&, lately appeared in au'addrefs to the
T l! â¢ from the Editor of the Gazette of Maine. They
ar ' 'Ã¼bftituted rn preference to any whi h the edi.or ot this
P*per m *s* l - further more particularly as coming from a
'remote quarter of the Union.
Pernaps here is no country, in anv part of the world, the in
â¢<i!!an.sot wh'ch are, (or maybe) fupplicd with public News
pnnrrs jt a cheaper rate than ihofe of America. The Farmer and
' Irrchant, the Laborer and the Mechanic, tmy, by the means
1 when h retires from the bufitiefs and fatigues
r - dav, take a view of the situation, the circumllances and the
3 '-jus revolutions of the several countries of the civilized woi !d â
" it mnft be a oleafing circumftanoe, that this is theprivilf re y
o icaUy the privilege of an American.
et it inert lore be remembered, that by virtue of this pr v -
* r Â» the body of the people cor.itamly obtain 2nd prefer vs such a
degree of knowledge as shall he comoetcnt to the prevention of
any attempt that be made by cunning and defigtnng men to
sap the foundation of our mnft iuvaluable constitution. Bur, let
the circulation of these Vehicles of Public Information becircum
fcribed, and the people will at once become uninformed of public
tranfa&ions, and the more enlightened Jew will engrolsthe privi
leges, immunities and prerogatives, which in the nature and fitnefs
of things, are the ir.defcafible right of the whole body ot the
people.
" It is presumed no American will need a ftimnlus of this na
ture to furnifli himfelt with public information. The cheap rate
at which it is offered, the love and glory of our country, will at
all times promotefuc.il a mode of conduct, as Pnall forever bar the
attempts of tyranny, ignorance and fupetilition."
$dT Several of the firjt Volume of this Gazette are wantedâ cajh,

NOTHING is more delightful.to a benevolent
inind than the fight of human iiappinefs,
and the traveller who beholds it in any country
will by the sympathy of nature /hare in the feli
city- Every traveller in this country will have
his feelings powerfully excited by feeing the
happielt people on Â©arch,with profpecfts unbound
edâHeaven, ever propitious to Amer'tca, is brown
ing the year with health and plenty, and we
every where behold the vivid countenance and
the smile of joy. The old query and complaint,
" Why were the former days better than these P is
not heard in the land. The people have tlie in
telligence to know the superiority of their blefl
ings, " out of the heart the mouth fpeaketh,"
and there is a voice of contentment and glow of
gratitudeâthere is a triumph of sentiment which
is American. Religion, which is the of
human exigence, now expands the virtuous mind
â with sentiments of felicity while recounting the
favors of Providence, and the wide prolpect of
future good to the world, from the events daily
unfolding hereâDiilnterefted benevolence is
Heaven in miniature.
The United States have only to continue their
exertions and progression in the line they are in,
and they'will rife with the flow of time, until
their populations and improvements exceed all
the nations of the world. This appears to bean
irrefiftable conclusion, from the foundation laid
by nature, apd the present Itate of thingsâln
truth there is nothing that can be opposed to this
happy conclusion, but a conjeAure that the peo
ple of America may be become ignorant, fools,
and madmenâBut as such a conjecture is against
all reason, it vanishes from the mind, and leaves
the field of hope every where bloH'oming with
flowers, and the moral hemisphere brightening
into day.âFrom the beginning of time there
were nigver so many causes.in operation to dif
fufe universal science, and such powerful and
multiplied means to enlighten the whole people
as are now seen in this country. If the design
of Providence can be learnt from the long chain
of causes and events which have conspicuously
marked the history of this country, moral rea
soning will confirm the conclusion from nature
and present fadts. Every appearance in reason
and nature, the pad and the present, express in
capitals the glowing profpedls and pre eminence
of Columbia. Let the EDUCATION OF THE
CHILDIIEN forever be considered and pursued
as the firft concernâby legislators, judges, cler
gymen, and by ALL men. This, and this only,
will crown with perfecft and never fading glory,
the empire of freedom.
FROM THE COLUMBIAN CENTINEL
Mr. Russell,
I SINCERELY congratulate the public on it*
late rich acquisition of historical knowledge
in the publication of Mr. Belknap's History of
New- Hamplhire.
If genius and merit are encouraged as they
ought to be, we may soon exped: to fee a com
plete history of each State ; and until this is done
we cannot expert an authentic and copious ge
neral hiltory of the United States.
South-Carolina and New-Hampshire are now
brought down to the present day, by native his
torians of our own foil, who do honor to their
parent Cotinubia, as they would to any other coun
try.
The history of Connecticut, we hear, is under
taken by the Rev. Benjamin Trumbull, of New-
Haven, and that of Georgia, by Edward Laug
â¢worthy, Esq.
Rh . le-Ifland, Delaware, Maryland and North-
Ca"ol; la, have not yet furniflied any regular
history, written by any of their foilsâwhat little
they have, has been written by foreigners.
That of Mafl'achufetts, New-York, New-Jer
sey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, are very incom
plete, and foine of tliem more than 50 years be
hind.
If we are so happy as 10 have gentlemen in the
several Slates poileffing the fidelity, candor, li
berality and industry of Belknap and Ramsay,
with their elegant simplicity and smoothness of
Itvle, they will not fail of pleasing. No one
who feels the honed: pride of being an Ameri
can, will think his library complete until it is
graced with the Histories of Belknap and Ram
say, and we may add of Minot, the Boflon Sail,/]}.

IT is generally f*id, that the King is to be per
mitted ro retire to Fcnminbleau, there to de
liberate with his Council upon the revised con-
Itirution, which is speedily to be presented lo
him. Without doubt Ire will be puzzled whe
ther to accept or refufe it ; for it will either be
accepting or refilling the Crown. He will have
leave to go to Fontninb'feau, to prove that ac

The proposed constitution being read, M. de
la Fayette rose. For a long while, gentlemen,
the people have been wishing for this constituti
onal aCt, which formed after mature deliberati
on, admits no longer of any ufeful delays ; but
which, on the contrary, every circamftance
prompts us finally to fix. It is at a time when a
combination of passions and interefls, is in moti
on around us, that it is proper to proclaim these
principles of liberty and equalityâto support
which, every Frenchman has irrevocably devoted
his life and honor.
The Aflembly, no doubt, also, is of opinion,
that it is full time to give to all the powers efta
bliflied harmony of motion ; that the nation may
have at foreign courts ionftitutional organs ;
that the numerous explanations they owe us may
be obtained, that the sleep of royal functions be
at an elid ; and that mutual confidence may re-
vive
I shall make no mention of the arduous duties
which our '.â¢ountry has a r ipht to expeift from
me, (because every facrifice to it is due) but rnuft
impatiently wi!h to fee it in afituation no longer
to cail for their exercise.
I propose that the Committee of Constitution,
should draw tip the plan of a decree, to fix the
forms to be fallowed in presenting the constitu
tion, when it is finally agreed to, in the name of
the French Nation, to the King, for his mofl in
dependent examination and accepting.
Agreed.

him, at the expence of government, the how
ever overfliot the mark, by committing a : capital
offence.
Mr. Hammond, the new Consul General to the
United States of America, arid late Secretary to
the Embafiy at Madrid, will let o(Fina few dnvs
for Philadelphia. His appointment is of the
highest importance to this country, as he has it
in conuniflion to conclude a treaty of Ofrenfive
and Defenfive Alliance between England and
America. The outlines of this treaty have been
already difcufl'ed, and we learn that some very
considerable commercial advantages are held out
to America as the basis of it, which will in time
supplant the greater part of the trade of Ruflia
with this country.
Permanent (tock was never known so higli ;
at the fame time, that which is considered not so
permanent, is alarmingly to the holders, upon
the decline. Whether a simple stagnation for a
day gave rife to the report that the Minister has
it in agitation to pay off the four per cents, or
whether such a report was thecaufe of their fur
ther declension, a short time perhaps may deter
mine. That such an event is at all likely to take
place, is a brilliant circumllance in favor of w he
finances of c;his country, and of those who hold
reins of government.
From the Eaft-lndies, the accounts brought by
the Aberpavenny, are favorable ; but not so ex
travagantly flattering as we may have been taught
to expect within tliefe few weeks by other ac
counts. When the dispatches left India Lord
Cornwallis was hastening to attack Tippoo's
grand army, and appearances promise every
thing.
At home, from every quarter of the kingdom,
the state of autumnal produce is most luxuriously
reported.
The clubs of Paris seem again to be restored ;
but they have not the influence with the Aflem
bly which they had.
The maddefl. feat of milled patriotism that ever
any unhappy country experienced, is at this
time exercising in Spain. The Church, no doubt,
has the sole conduifi of the present persecution
of strangers, which has taken place in every pro
vince throughout the kingdom ; and let us hope
it may prove what it feerns strongly fympromatic
of, the last convulsive struggle of fuperfticion.
Extrau from a private letter from the Eafi-lndies,
dated March 5
" I now write you from the top of the Ghauts,
within jo miles of Seringapatam, the capital of
Tippoo Sultan, and nearer by the fame distance
than ever English troops were before. The de- 1
tachment I am now with consists of a brigade 6f
light field pieces, which ascended the Ghauts
without opposition, the day before yesterday.
Our force, under Col. K artley,confifts of the 75th
regiment, the grenadiers, and the 7th battalion
of Bombay native Infantry (the troops the Col.
had with him at the glorious action at Trevan
ganny) to which were added a detachment of
the 73d reg. and a corps of Grenadiers, consist
ing of fonr European and five Native companies.
" Our situation in the Ghauts is such, as to
bid defiance to the Sultan's ntmolt power and
force. The remainder of the army, commanded
by Gen. Abercrombie, are in the vicinity of the
Pass, and our principal employ for some time
will be bringing up provisions, stores, and heavy
cannon.
" The whole army under General Abercrom
bie now coufifts of near 9000 fighting men, in
cluding the Travancore troops, strong ill artille

An English Proteftam Church has been opened
at Dunkirk-âthus the benefits of the French re
volution begin to be enjoyed, in the free exer
cise of religion.
In Dunkirk there are two Dutch Chapels, and
one Quaker meeting house, . . . ..
The perpetual rumors of a counter-revolution
operate very injuriolidy in refpe<st to the paper

blilhed, it is expected these rumors will lose their
pernicious effects.
The peace between the Emperor, the Ruffians
and Turks, leaves even the viclorious parties in
no better circumstances than when they began!
âIt is called a Statu qtto peaceâbut wiih what

An article under the Paris head states, that

By order of the Society,
WILLIAM COXE, Jtin.Sec'ry
aflei t lhat f:ich reports originate with the aris
tocrats to fee what efFeifi they may have on the
National Aflembly.
1 he late Dey of Algiers raised himfelf from a
common soldier to that exalted ft at ion, and go
verned a nation of Barbarians for twenty-five
years with uncommon reputationâhis rulingpaf
lion was avariceâhe accumulated immense riches
âwhich, with his dignity do not descend to his
family, but are polTelied by his fucceflor Cid Haf
fan.
The loss. occasioned by the burning of the Ma
gazines in the Admiralty at Amsterdam, amounts
to 1,200)0.00 florins.
The hereditary Prince of Orange is on a jour
ney into Germany. >
The harvest in France has been abundant the
pall season.
The English fleet has been paid offâand what
is uncommon, the molt remarkable harmony ap
pears among thefoldiers and sailorsâno riots or
confufion have taken place, which has frequently
been the cafe on similar occasions.
Tims has ended the third bloodless war of
Great Britain !âThe firft secured to the Stadthol
der the government of Hollandâthe Iccond the
Cat ikins of Nootka Sound to the Englijhâand
the last, to the Porte the liberty of making the
belt peace they could !
The Club of Jacobirls'in Paris have wrote a
letter of condolance to Do<ftor Prieitly, on the
lofles he has fuflained by the late riots.
Lieut. Governor Simcoe was to embark far
Quebec the firft of September.
Addrefles Tiave been presented to the King,
Jiy the principal' liilTabitanrs of the county of.
Warwick, and the Diflenters of the. town of Bir
mingham,âthe firll thank his JVlajefty for his
paternal care of all his subjects; and particular-,
ly express their gratitude for the recent inltance
of that care exhibited during the lata riots, by
tlireifting fach ample relief for their necelfities
âThat from the Diflenters profefles their at
tachment, to the conftitutiou, and revolution prin
ciplesâit laments the want of energy in the ci
vil power during the late riots, but at. the fame
time recognizestheirobligations for his Majelty's
beneficial and decisive attentionâThe gentlemen
who presented the addrefles were graciously re
ceived.
The revolt which took place in the kingdom
of Morocco, has been appealedâ*-the troops of
the King's half brother were defeated, and him
felf obliged to retreat to a place of fafety.
The King of Svveden has retnrned to Stock
holm, his capital.
A'morion was lately made in the National As
sembly to infei't a clause in the Constitution, by
which the Princes of the blood-royal would have
been deprived of the rights of atftive citizens, and
consequently precluded from a feat in theAlfein
bly. This vras vehemently opposed by M. d'Or
leansâwho said he would sooner relinqnifh his
claim to an eventual succession to the Crown, than
be deprived of those rights and privileges. His
speech was received with applause, and the mo
tion rejected.âThe population of 3VI â¢ d Orleans
runs high, according to the lall accounts.
M. Barnave, it appears, has been thrown into
the minority, by lome recent decisions. Ihe
pamphleteers and eflayifts of Paris, have for a
Ion"- time past severely lampooned M. Barnave.
A leti er was lately read in the National Aflem
bly, from the Minister of War, stating the diffi
culties resulting from drawing off the ftatiotied
troops for the defence of the frontiersâand pro
posing a fubltitute foniething like the Minute-
Men of the United States dujing the late war.
Peace and tranquility are now perfetflly re
fiored to the capital of France. The red fag, the
signal of martial law, is taken downâand the
â white, the emblem of peace, elevated in its place.
The regiment of Berwick has quitted the ser
vice of the National Aflembly, and gone over to
the fugitive Princes.
Monday next is the day appointed by law for
the meeting of the second Congress of the United
States under the New Contlituiton.
' The following, among other important lub
iecis, will probably claim their attention at the en
ine session. The Poft-Officeâthe Militiaâthe
1 'iftieries âthe Reports of the Secretary of State
1 in this fubjecft, and on Coins, Weights and Mea.
iiresâthe Judiciary System, and ihe Repoit of
I he Attorney of the United Statesâ Manufadtui es,
and a Report thereon, to be made by the ~ccre
tai y of the Treasury, pursuant to orders of the
late House of R eprefetjtatives the National
Mintâa Navigation Lawâthe Land-Office of the
United States, &c. &c.-The deliberations of the
Lesiiflature of the Union, at this fefnon, mult
therefore be highly interelting to our country.
I May a spirit of wisdom and patrioti.m mnu
l tnce and guide their councils-May their mea
sures be crowned with luccefs ; and equally with
those of their predecetlors, receive the approba
tion of their conftituenii.

Next Friday is the day appointed for the elec
tion of twenty-five -Directors of the Bank of
the United States. Arrangements have- been
made by the Stockholders in this city, to co-ope
rare with those from other parts of the Union in
this bufinefisâand there is every Veafon to sup
pose that focli characters will be chosen, as by
their wisdom, prudence and integrity, will ren
der this inflitutiona public benefit.
The committee appointed by the Stockholders
of this city, ;to confer with the committees or
gentlemen Stockholders, who may come from the
other States, on this occasion, confilt of the fol
lowing gentlemen :âRobert Morris, IfaacWhar
'oiÂ«, Edward Fox, Robert Rallton, Jeremiah Par-
-'*r âThis committee is to report their proceed
ing* to the City Stockholders to-morrow evening;
at Carpenter's Hall,
A correspondent obfefves, that in the general ticket to be form
ed and delivered in on Friday next, for twenty-five Dirc&ors of
the National Bank, every Stockholder or gentleman qualified by
proxies to vote at the general meeting, would do well to examine
attentively a full lift of all the candidates of every Stateâfrom
these, the judicious will felcft on general principles, with a su
preme regard to the public good.
In Europe, our correspondent further observes. Bank Dire&ors
are alwavs chofeA from among the firft mercantile chara&ers, or
from such of the more refpe&able mechanics, as have by the extent
of their business qualified themselves for the office.
Commercial men are the best judges of characters in trade, and
fherefote are the belt to regulate a difcount-officeâbut however
true this may bÂ«, it will probably be thought eligible to admit
one or more Gentlemen of the Lawâone or more Members of
Congressâand one or more Directors of State Banks ; yet it mull
be apparent thatof thefe,orof charaftersof a highly fpeculativecaft,
the number ought to be small. All will do well to reflect, that on
the a'pett affairs (ball resume at the outset, will the future profpefts
and success of the Bank depend.
By late accounts from Port-au-Prince, it appears that a coaiitioo
haS beeri foimed between the whites and th t free people of colour â
and by a written convention, the whites have recognized the rights
and privileges granted to the people of colour by the National As
sembly, as well as those which they claim under certain ancient
edicts of the French Monarchs.
Accounts were received in town 13ft Monday, of a dreadful
conflagration 'n Newbcrn, North-Carolina, on the 28th tilt. a great
of that flourifhing town fell a facrifice to the flames ; sixty-three
houses being consumed. The % ravages of the deftruftivc element
were checked by blowing up several houses with gunpowder.
A similar expedient was adopted to stop the progress of the great
fire in London*, in the reio;n of Charles the Second. Ihe lols
is computed at ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND-POUNDS.
By a letter from Mr. Fenwick, the American Consul at Bour
deaux, published in a Richmond paper, it appears that the vfflel
mentioned in our last, addreflVd to McfTrs. M'Carthv and Brothers,
with two others, all went to England previous to their going to
France, from whence thev received their last orders. 1 his mode,
it was supposed, would tend to make England the entrepot of to
bacco for France, and deltrov in lome measure the encreafing in
tercourse between France and America, to the injury of ihc trade
with France, without benefiting that ot America.
An office is opened in London for the sale of Stocks in the Ame
rican Funds.
Cambricks of a superior finenefs are now manufactured in Ire*

Old and New Testaments of his Royal Otiarto Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE. The Apocrypha and Index, See. will he finifh

Such Gentlemen as hold Sunsc r i ft ion Papers, he beg* will
return them to him at lVayccflcr y or to him and Company at BcJlon y
by the lad day of November next, and as much sooner as they con
veniently can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work, has been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their higWeft approbation; both as to the execution of the
printing, its corre&nefs, and its cheapness compared with English
copics of the fame size and quality.
As this verv laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
is carried on folelv at his own cost, he is led to hope that all those
who wi(h to p'olTefs a large Family Bible, will so far encourage this
laudable undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
to the fubfeription.
