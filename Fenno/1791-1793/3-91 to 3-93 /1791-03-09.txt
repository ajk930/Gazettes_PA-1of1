Discourses on Davila. No. 25.
(Continued from No. 88 oj this Gazette.)
THE Queen, perfeflly informed of all these pioje&s, and wifil
ing to prelerve, with all her power, her own liberty and that
of her children, continued to play oft' her artifices, to ballance the
power of the Grandees, and to prevent the a fee nd eric yof one par
ty over the other, from drawing after it, the ruin of the State.
Thus, that she might not be obliged to favor, one or the ether par
ty, {he quitted Paris and retired to Fontainbleau. She thought,
that in this refidencc, where (he was more at liberty, than *n Paris,
they could not compel her to declare herfelf, and (he still studied
tofupport her confidence, which Ihe had managed with both fac
tions, whose Chiefs Hie amused by equivocal discourses, and am
biguous promises. The Prince oi Conde, and Coligni, yielding
to the superiority of the Catholic party, had quitted Paris to take
arms. The Queen gave them secretly to understand, that flie
was disposed to join them, as soon as {he Ihould fee them sup
ported by torces fufficient to make head against their enemies.
On the other hand, (he protested to the King of Navarre, the
Constable and the Duke of Guise, that (he had no intention to fc-
parÂ«.ts herfelf from the Catholics, nor to consent to the new re
form, any further than neceflity and the adviceof good men should
oblige her, to grant to the Hugonots, a moderate liberty.
H< r letters were not less ambiguous, than her words : and she
did .tot explain herfelf more clearly abroad than at home. She
gave continually new inftruftions to the ambassadors in foreign
courts, and especially to Delile, who resided at Rome. Some-
times she contrasted and at other times (he extended their pow-
ers , and by these variations held all minds in fufpence. But this
conti ( )Â£t began to be more delicate than ever. The Chiefs of the
two parties, were not less politicians than herfelf : During the
course of her regency they had found opportunities to unravel all
her artifices, and penetrate all her disguises. The King advanced
in age, and that circumstance was to them a neceflity to hasten the
execution of their designs. His minority might give to certain
measures a colour, which would no longer exist, when he would
be of age when all ought to depend upon his will, to which they
could no longer oppose themselves, without the guilt of rebellion :
At theprefent moment they could pretend, that their opoofition
-was only to a bad adminiflration, and the pernicious designs of
those who governed under his authority.
Already the Duke of Guise, more enterprising and more alive
than the others, direÂ£fced, at his pleasure, the refdlutions of his
party. He had drawn into his sentiments the Contlable and the
King of Navarre, by persuading them, that if they would all re
sort to court, they might bring ojf' the King and the Queen-Mother to
the capital, and reduce them to the necessity of taking measures,
and ifluing edi&s, as the Catholics should judge convenient to
their interests, without exposing themfelvcs, any longer, to the
danger of being anticipated, and without permitting their ene
mies to seize on the King and avail themselves of his authority
The Prince of Conde had formed the lame olefign: He had re
tired at fivft to Meaux, and from thence to his estate, at la Ferte,
where he intended to aflemble the main body of his forces. This
resolution was the cffeÂ£f of the advice of the Admiral, luggefled
by the promises of the Queen, and by the projetts of the Catholics,
which had not escaped his penetrationânothing being more'com
mon in civil wars, than to difcovcr the deligns of an enemy either
by the infidelity of forne in the fccret, or by the multitude ot
spies who are employed. The chicfs of the Catholic party had I
occasion only for their ordinary retinue to execute their design :
the neighbourhood of Paris, which was wholly devoted to them,
assured them of fufficient forces, and offered them favorable oppor
tunities. On the contrary, the Prince of Conde, weaker than his
enemies, and followed by lew troops, was obliged to wait for the
Lords of his part), and the nobilit\ whom he had summoned from
fcveral provinces, who alfembled but {lowly. Thus the Catholics
"were before-hand, by appearing all well attended at the Court.
Their unfoiefeen arrival d'fconcerted not the Queen. Although
{he depended little on the success of her intrigues, she exerted hcr
felf to persuade the King of Navarre to depart from Court, with
the Princes and Lords who had accompanied him. 44 No man is
44 ignorant," said Ihe to him, " that the Catholic Lords would
44 take advantage of my weakness, and that of my son, to compel
44 us, to regulate the State, according to their inclinations, by go
-41 verning at the will of their ambition and private interests. This
*' eondufi, dire&ly opposite to the principles of honour and of
41 fidelity, of which they boast, is not less contrary to the tranquil
-4* lity and the confeivation of the State, which they pretend to
44 have alone in view. 44 To iflue new ediÂ£ls, and revoke thole
41 which have been published, is it not to put arms into the hands
44 of the Hugonots? These fettaries, already so audacious and so
44 ready to revolt, will complain aloud of injufticc, if we annul,
44 without reason, an edict prepared and accepted with the con
-41 sent of both parties. During the minority of the King, we
44 ought to avoid war, and the troubles inseparable from it, to the
44 utmost of our care and power. To whom will the nation im
-44 pute the disasters which will overwhelm it ? Will not an eter
-14 nal infamy be the portion of those who have the principal (hare
44 in government ? It was to avoid these dangers, and to take
44 away all pretexts from the incendiaries, that I fubfcribec) to the
41 ediÂ£l of January, and quitted the capital. The mod effettual
44 means of irritating the violence of an evil, which as yet is only
44 creeping on secretly, would be to carry us into a fufpefled city,
44 and repeal an edict already published. The King of Navarre,
44 and the Catholic Piinces, ought to remember, that it belongs
41 only to the flagitious, whose foitune is uncertain or desperate,
44 to excite civil wars. The Prince commands without contia
-44 diclion. The Lords of his party, loaded with riches, digni
-44 ties, employments and honours, enjoy the most flourifhing for
-44 tune. Can they envy the people an imaginary and momentary
44 liberty ? Let them fuffer the King to arrive at his majority, with -
44 out feeing his kingdom diftra6ted with war. Forced by nccef
-44 nty, I have onlv pardoned faults which I could not punilhâ
44 nor have I grantedtothe Hugonots other liberty than that which
44 they had usurped. It s only by management that we can cure
44 the people of th-.s phrenzy, Let the Catholic Chiefs then arm
44 themselves with patience, for fear that, by rafti remedies, they
44 may envenom an evil which may draw after it fatal revolutions,
44 and the most melancholly events. If however you are resolved
44 to make any alteration in the edict, it ought only to be done
by insensible degrees, and by the favor of suitable opportunities
44 To employ violent means, would be to fur
nilh the seditious with pretexts, which they seek. with so much
44 ardour."

" To catch the living manners as they rife."
IT is a circumstance much to be regretted, that
there has yet appeared no complete publica
tion, under the title of, a tour through the Utiited
States. Perhaps no species of composition is bet-
ter calculated both to amuse and inltrud:, than a
relation of travels, written with candor and dif-
The fadts communicated through
cernment
such a channel impress themselves much more
strongly on the mind than those which are col
lected through the medium of general history.
In fliort, some of the accounts of modern travels,
such as Moore's, Brydone's, Dupaty's, and fe-
veral others, occupy that middle station between
dry history, and gay romance, which unites the
utility of the former, with the allurements of the
latter. The scenery exhibited in travels may be
brilliant and fafcinating, at the fame time, that it
iscorreft and real. And it certainly must be of
more importance to gain information of charac
ters and incidents cotemporary with ourselves,
than of those which exiited in periods, remote
and diflimilar from our own. The preference of
current memoirs over those which have long past,
is alinoft as great, as true history is over fabulous.
There have been published some partial me
moirs,at one time and another, of travels through
the United States ; but as far as I can recollect,
they poflefl'ed more the spirit of criticifin than
philosophy. It is immaterial whether the pre
vailing opinions and manners, in this country,
compare exactly with such as the traveller has
been accustomed to notice in other countries.â
It is not oil the score of companion, that our
merit or our happiness is to be measured. The
customs and manners which are most commenda
ble, in many parts of Europe, would be highly
improper, were they adopted by the people of
the United States. The traveller, therefore,
who cannot discern the aptitude of our manners
and habits to our situation, fills his memoirs with
sarcastic criticisms, which mislead the unwary
reader, and stamp on his mind a thousand falle
impreuions.
There are two sources of delusion to which
memoir-writers are exposed, and against which
they fliould fortify themselves with the armour
of philosophic candor and precision. One of the
points to which I allude, is the liability of travel -
lers to overlook those circumstances which assimi
late with what they have been accustomed taob
ferve, and to confine their remarks to obje&s
which custom has not rendered familiar to them.
By this detached mode of viewing occurrences,
they exhibit only a few peculiarities in which
one nation differs from another, while they are
silent with refpedt tomany important particulars
in which both nations have a resemblance. Thus
it happens, we are led to imagine they are much
more unlike than they really are.
The other point about which a discussion pre
vails, is the pronenefs of travellers to draw general
conclusions from too small a number of particular
cases. This is a source of mistake, from which
even the most prudent and liberal man can hard
ly exempt himfelf. Exceptions from general
rules are so apt to be taken for the rules them
selves, that it requires the closest observation to
make the suitable diftindiions. Those inllances,
which maybe deemed exceptions to general rules,
are like some prominent part of an image, which
allures attention to itfelf, to the negle<ftof those
parts that are less conspicuously delineated. A
Frenchman, who undertook to write memoirs of
his travels through America, has given a fpeci
men of a mistake such as I atn defining. He was
entering the town of Boston, and observed a
small wooden building, on rollers, in the middle
of the streetâupon enquiry, he was told that
the building was put on those rollers to be re
moved to a conlulerable distance from the place
whence it was taken. Had he continued in Bos
ton two years, he probably would not have seen
another instance of the removal of any building
in that manner; nor perhaps is there one build
ing in fifty in that town that could be removed,
without firft taking the materials to pieces. How
ever, the Frenchman thought it a proper incident
to form a page in his memoirs. He mentions it
as a general circumstance, that the buildings in
the town of Boston are made of such light ma
terials, and eretfed upon such a model, that they
can conveniently be removed from one part of
773
HUso
[Whole No. 194-]
tlie town to another. This error of the French,
man is not more remarkable than frequently oc.
curs with people travelling in the United States.
Some incident takes place which fit ikes the view
of the traveller, and he records it the cha
raifteriftics of the people who are then under his
notice. Being thus deluded, and being too in
dolent to invelligate the real ftateof the matter,
he imposes upon the reader an extraordinary
instance, as something usually prevalent.
Too much applause cannot be given to the dis
cerning and liberal traveller, who justly describes
the objects that come under his view, and makes
the people of one country acquainted with the
existing opinions and manners of another. The
chains of superstition may be thus broken, and
the clouds of prejudice dispersed. Mankind hate
and persecute one another, only because they are
ignorant of the true character of those who ex
cite such hatred and perfecurion. Let the veil
of error be removedâlet true philosophers deve
lope the history of countriesâand men of all na
tions will find, there is much more reafontolove
and refpecfi each other than they have been tatight
to imagine.

FRIDAY, Feb. 4.
The BANK BILL under cons deration.
MR. LAWRANCE,
THE advocates of this measure Hand in an un
fortunate iituation ; for being those, who in
general advocate national measures, trey are
charged with aefignsto extend the powers of the
government unduly.âHe however consoled hitn
feJf with a conscious attachment to the Constitu
tion, and with the reflexion that their conduifi
received the approbation of their constituents.â
If the present, said he, is contrasted' with the
former circumstances of this country, he doubled
not the measures of this government would con
tinue to receive the approbation of the people of
the United States.
The silence of the people on the fubjed; now
J>efore the House is strongly presumptive that
the measure of a bank is not conlidered by them
as unconstitutional. He then endeavored to shew
the constitutionality of the bank system. It must
beconceded that there is nothing in the consti
tution expressly against it, and therefore we
ought not to deduce a prohibition by construc
tion ; he adverted to the amendment proposed
t>y Congress to the constitution, which fays, pow
ers " not delegated, are retained here said he,
to prove that the bank is unconstitutional, the
conftru&ive interpretation so much objected a
gainst, is recurred to.
The great objects of this government are con
tained in the context of the conftituiion ; he re
capitulated those objetSs, and inferred that eve
ry power necessary to secure these must neceffa
lily follow: For as to the great obje<fts for which
this government was instituted, it is as full and
complete in all its parts as any system that could
be devised ; a full uncontroulable power to re
gulate the fifcal concerns of this union is a pri
mary consideration in this government, and
from hence it clearly follows, that it must poflefs
the power to make every possible arrangement
conducive to that great objedl.
He then adverted to the late confederation and
pointed out its defe&s and incompetency and
hence the old Congress called on the States to
enacft certain laws which they had not power to
enadi ; from hence he inferred that as the late
confederation could not pass those laws, and to
capacitate the government of the United States,
and form a more perfedl union, the constitution
under which we now art was formedâto sup
pose that this government does not poflefs the
powers for which the constitution was adopted,
involves the grofleft absurdity.
The deviation from charters and the infringe
ment of parchment rights which had been juf
tified on the principle of neceflity by the gentle
man from Virginia (Mr. Madison) he said had
been made on different principles from those now
mentioned ; the neceflity he contended did not
at the time existâthe old Congress exercised the
power as they thought by a fair conftrutftion of
the confederation.
On conftruiftions, he observed it was to be la
mented that they (hould evei* be neceilary but
they had been made ; he instanced the power of
removability, which had been an ad: of the three
"branches-and has not been complained of. It
was at leafl as important a one as the present.
But the conftrudtion now proposed he con
tended was aneafy and natural conftrudion ; re
curring to the collection law, he observed that
it was by conftrudlion that the receipts are or
dered to be made in gold and silver.
With refped: to creating a mass of capital he
supposed, just and upright national measures
would create a will to form this capital.
Advening to the ideatliat Congress has not the
power to eftablifli companies with exclusive pri
vileges, he observed that by the amendments pro
posed by New-Hampfbire, Mallachufets and New-
York, it plainly appears that these States con
fide red that Congress does poflefs the power to
establish such companies.
The constitution vests Congress with power to
dispose of certain property in lands, and to make
all ufeful rules and regulations for that purpose ;
can its power be less over one species of its own
property than over another ?
With refped: to giving preference to one State
over another, he observed, that 10 years hence
the fear of government is to be 011 the Potowmac,
and wherever the government is finally fettled'
the place will enjoy superior advantages, but still
the government must go there, and the places
not enjoying thofeadvantages must be fatisfied.
It: is laid we mull notpafs a problematical bill
which is liable to a supervision by the Judges of
the Supreme Court ; but he conceived there was
no force in this, as those Judges are invested by
the Constitution with a power to pals their judg
ment on all Jaws that may bepafled.
Itisfaid that this law may interfere with the
slate governments ; but this or may not be
the cafeâand in all interferences of the kind, the
particular interest of a state, mult give way tothe
general interest.
With relpeiit to the corporation pofl'effing the
power of pafling lawsâthis he observed is a pow
er incidental to all corporationsâand in the in
stance of the Wellern Territory, Congress have
exercised the power of instituting corporations,
or bodies politic, to the greatelt polfible extent.
He defended the right of Congress to purchase
and poflefs property, and quoted a paflage in the
conltiuuion to Ihew that they poflels this right.
He then touched on the expediency of banks,
and of that proposed in particular : The advan
tages generally derived from these institutions,
he believed, applied peculiarly to this country.
He noticed the objection from banks banifliing the
specieâhe said the surplus only would be lent
out of the countryâbut is it given Sway ?âNo,
Sirâit is sent off for articles which are wantedâ
and which will enrich the country.
With refpeÂ«ft to a run 011 the bankâhe men
tioned the circumstances under which those runs
on the Britiftt banks, which had been noticed,
took placeâand (hewed there was no parallel that
would probably ever take place in this country.
From several particulars he (hewed, that the
objeiftion which arose from the United States'not
having made a good bargain by the fyflem, was
not well founded. He then mentioned the pecu
liar advantages which the United States will en
joy over common subscribers.
The objection from banks being already estab
lished in the several States, he obviated, by fluting
the inifchiefs which might arise from an ignor
ance of the situation of those banksâand con
cluded by some remarks 011 the inexpediency of
the general government's having recourse to insti
tutions of merely a local nature.

THE United States of America are now placed
in a refpeiftable situation. Their honor and
credit, which at certain periods seemed doubtful
are now eftablillied 011 a permanent bails. Bv
enlarging the system of our government, and bv
bringing the rtrength of the fevei al States into
one uniform plan of operation, we are enabled
to form connexions with other-nations ; todefend
the Union against foreign in vafions ; and topre
ferve harmony, and support juilice between the
citizens of the different States.
We prefunie it will ever be the disposition of
our legislature, to guard againlt every infringe
ment on the Constitution of our own State, being
convinced that by fucli conduct we give vigor and
energy to the general government.
The debt of the United States and of the par
ticular States, we conceive to be the price of our
peace, liberty, and independence, and it must be
a pleasing reflection that we are not obliged to
hare recourse to oppreflion and violence, to can
cel this debt, as the resources of our country
with decent economy, are amply fufficient to do
justice to our public creditors.
While contemplating the pleasing enjovment
of liberty and independence, we are no less bles
sed with the fruits of industry and peace. The

large and nnweildy for the Atlantic Ocean, and'
it is thought by some (who are not acquainted
with navigation) that it would have been better
to have laid out the money that she cost in two

Bank, and the other off Charlelton bar.

years, having received a found drubbing from
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary

an individual, that Lieutenant Col. Nefbit Bal

the late war between Great-Britain and the Uni

with the continental army in South-Carolina,and
other parties in arms, and did on many occasions

power, and arms, which were carried into the
country.
What a faithful servant was this commandant

Public clamour seems bufie,d in many parts, (as
appears by newspaper squibs) with the character
of General Harmar: His condudt in the late un
fortunate Indian expedition is severely handled.
A correspondent observes that fame generally
follows vidtory, and disgrace defeat ; people are
apt to view the actions of the unfortunate soldi

ly wounded by the latter, condemn the former in
iota.
Among the advantages that will accrue to Ver

to the enquiring mind. By this means the inter
erting concerns of our extensive empire will be
constantly and expeditioufly conveyed to us, and
domestic felicity heightened by an easy commu
nication with diltant friends. It will doubtless
be deemed a matter worihy attention to bring
the mail from Canada through Vermont. Ail of
fice may be established at Burlingtonbny, from
whence to Beuningron the poll will ride through
a fertile country, the population of which advan
ces perhaps equal to any part of America.
The present winter exhibits favorable profpeifts
to Vermont : emigration is truly great : more
than double the number of families are moving
daily than was even seen among us before. The
plentiful harvests of last year will afford ail abun
dant (upply to the industrious emigrant, while
the labour of his hands will augment the value
of an extensive, fertile country. Attention to a
griculture and manufactures in Vermont, toge

On the 22d. February, came on before the lion,
the Supreme Judicial Court of Maflachufetts, at
Bolton the trial of Edmund Freeman, Printer of
the Boflon Herald of Freedom, on the charge of
publilhing a libel against John Gardner, Esq.
After a very fair and candid inveltigation, the
cafe was committed to a respectable jmy, who
brought in their verdict, not guilty. " During
the trial, (fays a Bolton paper) the Hon. Court
were ir. their Scarlet Robes, attended by a vast

B R U SSELS, Dec. 3.
THE patriotic army are all fugitives, except
thecolumn with Gen.Koehler. Gen. Schoen
feklt, who commanded me cemre column in the
front of Namur, retreated across the Metife on
the 22d ulr. in the greatelt difbrder, without
even being attacked by the enemy ; his column
was thrown into great confufion : He immediate
ly deimnded his dismission, and obtained it, with
out being called to account for his condudi.
Thus tar you may guess how matters flood with
him and lits opposite neighbours. The Auftrians
taking their advantage, entered Namur without
the least opposition. Gen. Koehler's retreat was
maflerly, and does him great honor. He took
his rout from Bouvens to Mons, where he receiv
ed the appointment of commander in chief of
the army, and immediately endeavored to collect
the fugitives of Schoenfeldt's column together,
but too late. The greater part of the dragoons
were gone off with their horses ; the infantry
ofcourle, followed their example, who arrived
here in the greatelt confufion. They went in
large bodies to the town house, and demanded
pal'es, which being refufed, they instantly fired
at the magistrates through the windows. They
were then obliged to comply, to prevent worse
consequences. The mob, at the fame timeafleni
bled, broke into, and took from the several ma
gazines and store houses, of the (late all they con
tained ; and luckily for the inhabitants they a -
mused themselves so, or numbets of other houses
would have been pillaged and deftroyedby thole
wretches : Such was the scene in Brudels for 24
hours. Much more was to be feared from those
people than the Auftrians: however, the town
was yelterday relloredto its former tranquility,
by the arrival of the Auftrians, who were re

and amidst the repeated acclamations and lhouts

$3** Refpefting the numerous complaints received, on the
failure of the Gazette oj the United States, the Editor would inform
his subscribers, that since the firft of January last, the Mail has becÂ»
carried from this city to Baltimore, on horse-back, and lately th<*
road to New-York has been so bad, that the fame regulation has
been adopted on that route : The mercantile interest being consi
dered as the principal support of the Post Office, its accommoda
tion, in expediting the Mail, has given nfeto this arrangement â
Meantime the Stages, East and South, have plied as usual ; and the
Papers destined to Baltimore, and the louthward of that City, have
been regularly and pun&ually dispatched by them : The badnefsof
the roads to the eastward, has sometime? prevented the Stage from
this city, reaching Powles'-Hook, in season, to have the papeis
taken by the Stage bound to Boston : The public dispatches fre
quently occupy the greatest part of the Mail-Portmanteaus, and the
1 mpoflibility of transporting on horse-back, those of a lufficient size
to contain the letters, public dispatches, and the newspapers, all at
the fame time,often occasions the detention of the latter at the poft
office, for many days, after they are left there to be transmitted.
The foregoing are the only reasons that the Editor can aflign
for the recent disappointments, having never failed in a single m
ilance to have the Papers prepared in season.
As the original design of this publication was to diffufe infor

from a common centre, and the paper has received very general
approbation, and a more extensive circulation than perhaps any
other Newspaper ever published in Americaâthe Editor hopes
the present interruption will be so temporary, as not to exhaust the
patience of his subscribers.

BengatReport of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the
fubjeift of a Mint.
(concluded.)
IT is conceived that the weight of the cent may be eleven penny
weight, which will about correspond with the value of the
copper and the expence of the coinage. Thia will be to conform to
the rule of intrinsic value, as far as regard to the convenient size
of the coins will permit; and the deduction of the expence of
coinage in this cafe will be the more proper, as the copper coins,
which have been current hitherto, have passed till lately for much
mor,e than their intrinsic value. Taking the weight, as has been
fuggcfted,|the size of the cent may be nearly that of the piece here
with transmitted, which weighs todwt. ugrs. 10m. Two thirds
of the diameter of the cent will fuflice for the diameter of the half
cent.
It may perhaps be thought expedient, according to general
praflice, to make the copper an of profit; but where
this is done to any considerable extent, it is hardly poflible to have
effedual security against counterfeits. This confederation, concur
ring with the soundness of the principle of prelerving the intrin
sic value of the money ot a country, seems to outweigh the confi
d ration of profit.
The foregoing l'uggeiliom, refpefting the fizesofthe several coins,
are made on the fuppohtion, that the legislature may think fit to
regulate this matter : perhaps, however, it may be judged not un
advifeable to leave it to executive discretion.
With regard to the proposed size of the cent, it is to be con
fefitd, that it is rather greater than might be wished, if it could
"with propriety and fafety be made less : and should the value of
copper continueto decline, as it has done for iome time past, it is
very queflionable, whether it will long remain alone a fit metal
for money. This has led to a confederation of the expediency of
uniting a small proportion ot silver with the copper, in order to
be able to leflen the bulk of the inferior coins. For this, there are
precedents in several paitsof Europe. In France, the composi
tion, which is called billion, has confided of one part silver and
four parts copper ; according to which proportion, a cent might
contain seventeen grains ; defraying out of the material the ex
pence of coinage. The conveniency of size is a recommendation
ot such a species of coin; but the secretary is deterred from pro
posing it, by the apprehension of counterfeits.âThe effcÂ£l of so
small a quantity of silver, in, comparatively so large a quantity of
copper, could easily be imitated by a mixture of other metals of
little value, and the temptation to doing it would not be incon
siderable.
The devices of the coins are far from being matters of indiffer
ence,as they may be made the vehicles of ufeful impreflions. They
ought therefore to be emblematical, but without lofmg fight of
simplicity. The fewer sharp points and angles there are, the less
will be the loss by wearing. The lecretary thinks it btft, on this
head, to confine himfelf to these concise and general remarks.
The last point to be difcufTed, refpe&s the currency of foreign
coinsâ
The abolition of this, in proper season, is a necessary part of
the system contemplated for the national coinage. But this, it
will be expedient to defer, till some coniiderable progress has
been made in preparing fubflitutes for them. A gradation may
therefore be found moil convenient.
The foreign coins may be fuffered to circulate, precisely upon
their present footing, for one year after the mint fliall have com
menced its operations. The privilege may then be continued for
another year to the gold coins of Portugal, England and France,
and to the lilver coins of Spain. And these may dill be permit
ted to be current, for one year more, at the rates allowed to be
given for them at the mint ; after the expiration of which the cir
culation of all foreign coins to cease.
The monies, which will be paid into the treasury, during the
firft year, being recoined, before they are iflued anew, will afford
a partial substitute before any interruption is given to the pre-ex
iftmg supplies of circulation. The revenues of the succeeding
year, and the coins which will be brought to the mint, in confc
quence of the discontinuance of their currency, will materially ex
tend the substitute, in the course of that year, and its extenfton
will befofar encreafed, during the third year, by the facility of
procuring the remaining species to be recoined, which will arise
from the diminution of their current values, as probably to enable
the dispensing wholly with the circulation of the foreign coins,
after that period. The progress which the currency of bank-bills,
will be likely to have made, during the fame time, will also afford
a substitute of another kind.
This arrangement, besides avoiding a sudden flagnation of cir
culation, will cause a considerable proportion of whatever loss
may be incident to the establishment, in the firft instance, to fall,
as it ought to do, upon the government, and will probably tend to
diftributc the remainder of it more equally among the commu
nity.
It may nevertheless be advifeable, in addition to the precautions
here suggested, to repose a discretionary authority in the Pre
sident of the United States, to continue the currency of the Spanifli
dollar, at a value corresponding with the quantity of fine silver
contained in it, beyond the period above mentioned for the epila
tion of the circulation of the foreign coins. It is poflibte that an
exception in favor of this particular species of coin may be found
expedient ; and it mav tend to obviate inconveniences, if there be
a power to naake the exception in a capacity to be exerted when
the period shall arrive.
The Secretary for the department of State, in his report to the
House of Representatives, on the fubjett of eftablilhing a uniform
ity in the weights, measures and coins of the United States, has
proposed that the weight of the dollar should correspond with
the unit of weight. This was done on the supposition, that it
would require but a very small addition to the quantity of metal,
which the dollar, independently of the objedl he had in view,
ought to contain ; in which he was guided by the relolution of
the Bth of August, 1786 âfixing the dollar at 375 grains and 64
hundredths of a grain.
Taking this as the prop r standard of the dollar, a Imall altera
tion for the fake of incorporating so systematic an idea would ap
pear deferable. But if the principles which have been reasoned
from, in this report, are just, the execution ot that idea bccomes
more iitr.cult. It would certainly not be advifeable to make on
th it account, so considerable a change in the money unit, as would
be produced by the addition of five grains of silver to the proper
we?ght of the dollar, without a proportional augmentation ot its
relative value. And to make such an augmentation would be to
abandon the advantage of prefcrving the identity of the dollar, 01
to speak more accurately, of having the proposed one received
and considered, as a mere substitute lor the present.
The end may however be obtained without either of those in
conveniencies, by encreafing the proportion of alloy in the silver
coins. But this would destroy the uniformity, in that refpeft,
between the gold and silver coins. It remains therefore to elett
which of the two systematic ideas fnall be pursued or relinquished.
And it may be remarked, that it will be more easy to convert the
present silver coins into the proposed ones, ifthefe last have the
fame, or near ly the fame proportion of alloy, than if they have
less.
The organization of the mint yet remains to be considered.
This relates to the persons to be employed, and to the services
which they are refpettively to perform. It is conceived that there
ought to be
A dirtftor of the mint, to have the general fuperintendance oi
the business.
An a flay matter, or aflayer, to receive the metals brought to the
Siiint, afcertatn their finenefs, arid deliver them to be coined,
A master coiner, to condutt the making oÂ£ the coins.
A cashier, to receive and pay them out.
An auditor, to keep and adiuft the accounts of the mint.
Clerks, as many as the directors of the mint (hall deem neces
sary, to afljlt the different officers.
Workmen, as many as may be found requisite.
A porter.
In several of the European mints, there are various other offi
cers, but the foregoing arc those only, who appear to be indispen
sable. Persons in the capacity of clerks will fuffice instead of the
others, with the advantage of greater economy.
The number of workmen is left indefinite, because, at certain
times, it is requisite to have more than at others. They will, how
ever, never be numerous. The ex pence of the establishment, in
an ordinary year, will probably be from fifteen to twenty thou
sand dollars.
The remedy for errors in the weight and alloy of the coins mufl
necefTarily form a part in the system of a mint ; and the manner
of applying it will require to be regulated. The following ac
count is given of the pra&ice in England, in this particular.
A certain number of pieces are taken promiscuously out of eve
ry fifteen pounds of gold coined at the mint, which is deposited
for fafe keeping in a strong box called the pix. This box, from
time to time, is opened in the presence of the lord chancellor, the
officers of the treasury, and others ; and portions are feleÂ£ted from
the pieces of each coinage, which are melted together, and the
mass afTayed by a jury of the company of goldsmiths. If the im-
P'Ttettion and deficiency both in the finenefs and weight, fall
ihort of a sixth of a carat, or 40 grains of pure gold upon a pound
of standard, the mailer of the mint is held excusable ; because it
is supposed that no workman can reasonably be answerable for
greater exa&nefs. The expediency of some similar regulation
feeras to be manifeft.

PROPOSALS
FOR PRINTING BY SUBSCRIPTION, A
COLLECTION of STATE PAPERS,
INTENDED AS MATERIALS FOR
AN HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
By EBENEZER HAZARD, A. M.
IN this collection will be contained the Cmart*rs of the
feveial states which now compose the Union ; âthe Recordi
of the United Colon iesof Ne w-Enc la nd Royal Inftiuc
tions to Colon lal Governors ; âExt rac ts from Pu bl 1Â«
Records ; âand other authentic Documents tending to elucidate
our History.
The design of this compilation was intimated to Congress, and
honored with their approbation.â On the 20th July, 1778, their
committee, to whom his memorial was referred, reported it as
their " Opinion, that Mr. Hazard's undertaking is laudable and
deserves the public patronage and encouragement, as being pro
ductive of public utility;" Whereupon they * s Resolved, That
it be recommended to the Governors, Prefidcnts, and Executive
Powers of the several states in the union, to aflift Mr. Hazard,and
give facility to his labors ; and that for this purpose he be admit
ted to an infpe&ion of public records, and be furnifhed without
expence with copies of such papers as he may judge will conducc
to the valuable end he hath in view.
He was, of consequence, admitted to the infpeftion and use both
of public records, and the collections made by individuals, from
whence this compilation (much the largest he has ever met with
on the fubjeft, and, he flatters himfelf, the largest ever made ia
America) was formed. It has since met the approbation of manv
eminent charafters,and even in its manuscript state, has facilitated
the settlement of some important controversies.
The compiler cannot suppress the following letter from the honor*
able the Secretary of State, to whose infpeftion part of the com
pilation was submitted, as it contains so flattering and refpefta
ble a testimony in favor of the importance of thowork.

a multiplication of copies as Jhall place them beyond the reach of accident;

wifhzs it a more complete success than, S IR,
