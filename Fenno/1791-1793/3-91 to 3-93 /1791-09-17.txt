[No. 41, of Vol. lII.] Saturday, September 17, 1791.
LONDON.
TO put the public in pofleffion of every fact
relative to the late riots at Birmingham, we
find ourselves under the necelfity of giving Them
that inflammatory and treasonable hand-bill
which vvas circulated by the Preibyterian party
011 Wednesday last, in tiie following words:
' My Cnuntrymtn
' The second year of Gallic Liberty is nearly
expired ; at the commencement of the third, on
the 14th of this month, it is devoutly to be wifli
ed that every enemy to civil and religious des
potism, would give his fantftion to the majestic
common cause, by public celebration of the an-
niverfary
' Remember, that on the 14th of July, the Baf
tile, that high altar and callle of despotism fell !
' Remember the cnthufiafin, peculiar to the
cause of liberry, with which it was attacked!
' Remember that generous humanity that
taught the opprefled groaning under the weight
of intuited rights, to save the lives of the op
prellors !
' Extinguish the mean prejudices of nations !
and let your numbers be collei r (ed, and Cent as a
free-will offering to the National Aflembly.
' But, is it polfible to forget that your parlia
ment is venal-, your ininifter hypocritical; your
clergy legal oppreflors ; the reigning family ex
travagant ; the crown of a great peilbriage 100
weighty for the head that wears it; too weighty
for the people who gave it; vour taxes partial
and opprelfive ; your representatives a venal junto
upon the sacred rights of property, religion and
freedom.
' But on tlic 14th of this month prove to the
fycoph.mts of the day, that you reverence the
Olive Branch ; that you will facrifice to public
tranquillity till the majority ill ai I exclaimâ
' The pcace of /hue rj is worse than the War cj
Freidom!âof the clay let Tyrants beware!'
Can any man of honest principlesâcan any
loyal fubjecftâcan even the boldelt of our anti
ministerial senators read this without fiiudderinji
at the dreadful scene it was meant to realize : â
Rebellion is featured on its countenanceâand
Republicanism centered in its bosom. Hewho
withes to defend his property âhe who loved the
Conllituiion under which that property flourifli
edâmuft no doubt have taken the aiarm at so
darinj; a libel against all that was dear to Eng
lifhinen.
The public however was determined before
they proceeded to violence, to have fomefurther
proof of the intention of (hole Conimeinoratioii
ftlen. This hand-bill might be a forgeryâor
might be an infidiou* scheme to raise a mob far
the purpose of plunder ; âthey therefore waited
till they heard what was said at tableâhow the
political complexion of the company would ma
liifett itfelfâand whether any thing more than
a mere scene of commemoration conviviality was
intended.
They had indeed their suspicions, and these
fulpicions, after the fir ft course, were realised, by
the following toall being drank :
" DESTRUCTION TO THE PRESENT GO
VERNMENTâAND THE KING's HEAD UPON
A CHARGER."
The inhabitants, and they were almost to a
man refpeÂ«siable house-keepers and manufatfiur
ers, who waited outiide the Hotel to watch the
motions of the revolutionists within, no sooner
â was this treasonable toast made known to tlieni,
than Loyalty fwift as lightning fliot through
their minds, and a kind of eledrical patrjotifm
animated them to instant vengeance. They rulh
ed into this conventicle of treason, and befoie
the second course was well laid upon the table,
broke the windows and glafles, pelted and ini'uli
ed these modern reformers, and obliged tliem to
seek for fafety in an immediate flight.
By eight o'clock, upwards of two thoufancl
persons were collected ; their fir ft a<ft was to
break all the windows of the hotelâthey then
proceeded to Dr. Priestley's new meeting house,
which they Siortly con fumedâihe old meeting
houfc became next the objecft of their fury, and
shared the fame fate. Irritated by one another
against the Dilienters,tbey determined (una voce)
todeftroy Dr. Priestley's dwelling-houle at Pair
hill, one mile from Birmingham. It according
ly was beset about midnight, and before ten
o'clock, the following morning, was entirely de
July 19
inoliilietl. We lament to hear his library and
elaboratory, with ail Ills phiiofophical aparatus,
were confunied, as well as every other article in
the house. The Dr. was apprised of their in
rentions in time to escape with his family to a
house in the neighborhood. Oil Friday morn
ing nine persons were found dead in the ftieers,
and several others have been dangeronlly wound
ed, by the falling of lioufes, &c. &c.
At York, Manchester, Derby, Bristol, and some
other places where the Revolutioniits aflembled
on the 14th in It. the populace {hewed ttrong in
clination to rile, but were prevented by the pre
cautions taken by the magistrates.
RIOTS A-T BIRMINGHAM.
Friday Evening, "July 15.
This Jay, afrer the 1110b had completed the
deltrucftion of Dr. Priestley's house and
tory, by fire, and also his garden, the Eail of
Aylesford, and fume oilier gentlemen, led a great
part of the rioters from Sparkbrook 10 Birming
ham, in hopes of difperling them, but without
effect
A great number, about one o'clock, afTembled
round the eleganr man lion of Mr. John Ryland
(formerly the residence of Mr. Baikerville, the
celebrated printer) which had lately been en
larged and beautified at great expence. The
most foorhing means were adopted to make them
desistâmoney was even offered them to induce
them to retire, but to 110 purpose ; for, firft ex
haufling the contents of the cellar, they then set
fire to the house ar.d furniture. The conflagra
tion was dreadful !
About half past three, the inhabitants were
summoned by the bell-man to afTemble in the New
Church yard ; two Magistrates attended in an
adjacent room, and swore in several hundred
constables, composed of every description of in
habitants, wl)o marched away to disperse the
rioters, who were employed in the deltriic-'tion
of Mr. Ryland's house.
On entering the \va\ls which surrounded the
house, then all in a blaze, a most dreadful con
flict took place, in which it is iiupoffible to after
tain the number of the wounded. The conita
bles were attacked with such a fhow'erof stones
and brick bats as it was iiupollible to refill. The
iiote:s then poilefling themselves of some of the
bludgeons, the constables were entirely defeated,
many of them being much wounded ; one per
son was killed, but of which party it is not yet
known.
The rnob being now victorious, and heated
with liquor, every thing was to be dreaded, they
began and soon effected the deflrutSion of Mr.
Hutton's house, in the Higli-ltreet, plundering
it of all its property.
From thence they proceeded to the feat of
John Taylor, Esq. banker. There, five hun
dred poundi were offered them to desist, but to
no purpose, for they immediately set fire to that
beautiful mansion, which, together with its su
perb furniture, stables, offices, green lioufe, hot
honfe, &c. are reduced to a heap of ruins.
This day the following hand bill was circula
ted among the people :
Birmingham, July 16, 1791
Friends and Fell'jiv Countrymen !
It is earneltly requested, that every truefriend
to the Church of England, and to the Laws ef
his Country, will refleJt how much a continu
ance of the present proceedings moil; injure that
church and that king they are intended to sup
port ; and how highly unlawful it is to destroy
the rights and properties of any of our neigh
bors. And all true friends to the town and trade
of Birmingham in particular, are entreated to
forbear immediately from all riotous and violent
proceedings, dispersing and returning peaceably
to their trades and callings, as the only way to

this great and flourifhing to\vn.

[Whole No. 249.]
This moment Mr. Button's country-house, a
bout two miles from Birmingham, is 011 fire.'
Eight o'clock in the Evtniug.
The rioters are now demolishing the bearitiful
house of Mr. George Humphrey's, and that of
William liutfel, Elq. a Utile further on in the
Oxford road. Ihe Ihops are still kept fliut up,
and 110 military are yet arrivedâdreadful de
predations are expected in the course of This
night ! The remains of several poor wretche*
who had got drunk, and were burnt to death in-
Mr. Ryland's cellar, have been dug out ; one
so much burnt, that he was recognized only by
the buckle in one of his shoes ; what could be
collecfted of his remains have been jull taken a
way in a basket. Another has been brought frdni
the ruins of Dr. PrielHey's house, who is fuppol
ed to have been killed by a fall of some of tba
buildings.
The people who demoiifhed Mr. Humphrey's
house, laboured in as cool and orderly a manner
as if they had been employed by the owner at so
much per day.
Sunday, eleven o'clock In the mortiing.
No military vet arrived. Last night the peo
ple of Birmingham were trembling fpetftators of
the tremendous conflagration of Mofley Hall,the
property of John i aylor, Esq. but in the occupa
tion of Lady Carhampton.
About two this morning a most aweful scene
presented itfelf J four dreadful fires within a
mile of each other ! Ic is certain that the house
of William Rufiell, Esq. and that of Mr. Hawks,
of Mofley, have shared the fate of Mofley Hall.
The gaols have been broke open, and all the
prisoners liberated.
Another express arrived in London lad night,
states, that between Sunday night and Monday
morning, a parry of the military had arrived ;
that notwithrtanding their exertions to Hop the
diftnrbances, the rioters had made a very formi
dable opposition, and killed many; that num
bers having been soldiers, and in the pofleflion
of fire-arms, the troops had fnffered a repulse ;
but that having received a considerable reinforce
ment, they were about to rally and to renew their
attacks against the mal-conter.ts, who w#re actu
ated by the greatest fury.
July 20.
By the Coach of La ft Night.
It gives us particular plenfure to announce to
the public, that peace isreftored to Birmingham,
the tumult having ftibfidecl on .\unday night in
that town, from which the mob had gone in a
large body towards Worcestershire early in the
morning. It was beiieved that a party of them
was gone in pursuit of Dr. Prieltly.
By a private letter from Birmingham, received
yesterday morning, we are informed, that Dr.
Priestly only Caved himfelf from the fury of thÂ«
mob by half an hour's notice. That his plate
had been previously sent off to a friend's house,
and that this and a pi ivate box of manufcripis are
all he has saved of his property.
The Insurgents of Birmingham had made a
gridiron of i mmenfefize, which they brought to
Dr. Prieftley'shoufe, where they said they meant
to broil an Anti-constitutional Philosopher by the
blaze of his own wri.ings, and light the fire with
the Rights ot Man.âMr. Paine's next pamphlet
is to be called the Wrongs of Manâit is to be an
inflammatory composition on the ruin of his
friend Priestley.
The French nobility in this country are in

consent of the Trinity-house for that pnrpole.
This light-house, when finiflied, it is thought,
will be of much service, particularly to coatte.s

the dangerous rocks about the Land s End, which
have proved fatal to many.

The following is a literal trunflation of a French let
ter, addrejfed by /V/'*. Thoi/uis Paine, to Abbe Sey
es, and inserted on the nth of this month, in the
Patriate Francoife. Parts, Bth July, 179*-
" AT the moment of my departure for En
gland, I read in the Moniteur of Tuesday lall,
your letter, in which you give the challenge, 011
the fubjedt of government, and offer to defend
what is called the monarchical opinion againit the
republican system.
I accept of your challenge with pleasure ;
and 1 place such a confidence in the superiority
of the republican system over that nullity of sys
tem, called monarchy, that I engage not to exceed
the extent of fifty pages, and to leave you the
liberty of caking as much latitude as you may
think proper.
" The refpedt which I bear your moral and
literary reputation, will be your security for my
candor in the courfc of this difculiion ; but, not
withltanding that 1 lhall treat tlie fubjetft seri
ously and sincerely, let me premise, that I consi
der myfelf at liberty to ridicule as they deserve,
rnonnfchical absurdities, whensoever the occasion
fliall present itfelf.
" By repubiicanifin, I do not understand what
the name ilgnifies ill Holland, and in lome parts
of Italy. I understand simply a government by
representationâa government founded upon the
principles of the declaration of rights ; princi
plas to which several parts of the French Consti
tution arise in contradiction. The declaration
of the rights of France and America are but one
and the fame thing in principles, and ahnofl in
expreflions ; and this is the republicanHm which
I undertake to defend agaiaft what is called mo
narchy and arijiocrac}-.
Â« I fee with pleasure, that in refpetft to one
noint we are already agreed ; and that u the Â«c
---of a Civil Lift *f thirty rnillloK. 1
can dilcover no reason why one of the parts of
the government should he supported withftex
travapanr a profuiion, whilst the other Icarcely
receives what is fufticient for its common wants.
- This dangerous and diflionorable d.fpropoi
tion, at once ftpplie. the one with the means of
corrupting, and throws the other into the pie
is but little difference with regard to this point
between the and the executive part ot
onr government ; but, the fi.lt, is much better
attended to than in France. t u_
" In whatsoever manner, bir, I may treat the
fubjetft of which you have proposed the nivelti
pration, I hope that you will not doubt my enter
taining for you tbe highest eiteem. I must also
add, that 1 ain nit the perftnal enemy of kings .
Quite the contrary : No man more heartily
wilhes than myfelf to <ee then, all in the happy
and honourable state of private individuals ; but
I am the avowed, open, and intrepid enemy ot
what is called monarchy i and I am such by prin
ciples which nothing can either alter or corrupt
âby my attachment to humanity ; by the anxi
ety which 1 feel within for the dignity and the
honor of ihe human race ,by the disgust which
I experience when I observe men directed by
children ' overned by brutes ;by the horror
which all -he evils that monarchy has spread o
ver the eat , excite within my brealt; and by
those sentiments which make me shudder at the
calamities, the exactions, the wars, and the mal
facres with which monarchy has cruflied man

It appears, tliat under pretence of forming an
encampment, Mommedy, where the King ot the
French hoped to find an asylum against the per
fections of his own been filled with
an aftonifhiug number of tents.
The people there had been, for some time he
fore the escape of the King, baking bread day
and ni<Â»ht. A large quantity of oxen had been
bought. The town was, in (hort, full of ail kinds
of pT-ovifions and warlike ammunition.
Montmedy is situated 011 a mouutain, which
commands the roads which lead to Mctz, to SuO
nay, and to Sedan. It is exceedingly (trong,
both by nature and art.
In the reign of Louis XIV. it sustained during
forty days with open trenches, a vigorous siege,
at which the King was prelent, though the gar-
rifon confiftecl of only 3 00 men.
The town is bounded on the north by meadows,
through which glides the River Chier. These
meadows are of great extent, and are surround
ed with hills which reach the Aultrian territories
at about two leagues diltance.
This would have been a charming situation for
M. de Bonille's Camp. Here he would have
trenched himfelf under she A/tillery of the for
trefs; while he could have ealily maintained a
correspondence with the Auftrians, and secured
a fafe paflage to the French emigrants.
MANNER OF THE ESCAPE OF
MONSIEUR and MADAME.
" Monsieur and Madame arrived at Mons in 27 hours from Pa
ris accompanied only by the Count d* A â¢, and an English ser
vant belonging 10 that Nobleman. It was through the ftratagein
and afliftance of this man,that they effected their escape. He dis
guised the Prince in a plain black suit of clothes, blackened his
eyes with a oencil, and drefTed.him in one Â©f those wigs used in
England, which never require dressing ; in thort, he equipped him
as an homespun English Gentlemen. Thus accoutred, and speak
ing bad Fiench, interlarded with Englilh, making life of a forged
palTport, which the ingenuity of the fame fellow had provided,
Monsieur and his contort cleared the Frontiers of France, though
not without some danger of being discovered from an unfortunate
accident that happened to them from their carriage being over
turned in the cross-roads in order to avoid palling through the
town of Maubeuge.
The Dukes Montmorency and Laval, with the Count de Bri
enne and some other French Noblemen, were waiting at Mons
for Monsieur's arrival. The latter after flaying there a few hours,
proceeded by Namur to meet the King and Queen in the Province
of Luxembourg. He arrived at marche en Famine, in the evening
of the 23d, where he lodged at the house of a private gentleman
who had been previoully informed of his coming. The Prince
bein" still upon the borders of France,thought it prudent to keep
| himfelf incog. He is now fafe at Namur.
ANECDOTE OF M. DE BOUrilE
This nobleman, whose late conduift in France |
has surprised nlany, is poflefTed of every amiable
qualificationâbrave as Csfar, he is as humane as
he is braveâWhen Commandant-General of the
French Weft India islands, during the late war,
a fliip was cast away on one of them, which had
on board several hundred EnglfthmenâThefe,
in a deplorable situation, fu-pplicated the Marquis
to receive them, and to be made prisoners of war.
" No," returned the Geuera'l, " The King, my
inalter, does not make war with the elementsâ
had you been taken in battle, you (hould remain
his prisoners; but your cafe il otherwiseâl have
ordered you cloathing and refrefhment âand
have directed a ship to be got ready to transport
you to the dominions of your King."âWhich
was done.

The following note from M. de Florida Blanca
to the Spanilh Ambaflador at Paris, written in
the name of his Catholic Majesty, was official
ly comii'iniicatetl to the Aflembly.
" THE retreat of his Molt Christian Majesty
from Paris, his intentions, his complaints eoulj
not originate from any ether cause than the
hopes of freeing liimfelf and the royal family
from the outrages of the people.
" It may ealily be proved that the present As
sembly, and the municipality had not the power
to stop, or to puriifh them tor endeavouring to
repair to a place of fecuriry, where the Monarch
might form deliberations with the true and law
ful" Reprefenratives of the Nation, acfting in full
freedom. Of this privilege it is too evident that
his Majesty has hitherto been deprived.
" On these accounts, his Molt Catholic Majes
ty, as the firm ally of France, as a near relative
and friend of his Christian Majesty, and as pof.
feffing a kingdom contiguous to his dominions,
takes the deepest interest in the happiness and
tranquility of the French Nation. He is so far
from wishing to disturb them, that he conjures
and exhorts the French to reflect on the insults
which their Sovereign has experienced, and
which were the causes of the steps which he
found himfelf obliged to take. He warns them
to refpeit the high dignity of his sacred person,
and to maintain and defend the prerogatives of
their Sovereign and the immunities of the Royal
Family.
" The French Nation may reft allured, that so
long as they fulfil these duties (and his majeftjr
hopes they will always fulfil them) they will
find the King always ready to manlfeft towards
them, the fame fentinients of friendlhip and re
gard which he has ever (hewn them and which
are much better suited with their situation than
any other measures."
The Aflembly was resolved to obfervethemoft
profound silence, after the reading of this pa
per ; and the only notice which they resolved
to take of it was to order the military commit
tee to take proper precautions that the frontiers
may be in a (Vate of defence.
At length M. de St. Etienne observed, that at
the intention of the Spanish minister was that
this paper should be communicated to the As.
fembly, it was highly proper to return ananfwer,
and that this answer should be given in a molt
solemn manner, asfollows.â" That a* the French
nation does not intend to meddle with the affairs
of foreign powers,(o foreign powers have no buG
nefs to meddle with the affairs of the French na-
This opinion was highly applauded and adopted.

all the principles effrntial to the monarclly QCCU rred;
that inviolability might ceafc. This ca c own ca Â«.
neverthelefj, the king is dragged as a crim def ol l e d o his
tal, and made a pnfoner in his â¢ D fr f n 'Â°d !he inviolability of*
1 prerogative. 7 hus, after having i Â£ dellroy it*
king by decrees, they annul them in order to deltroy" Amidst these outrages offered to the monarch, to his august
family, and in their pcrfons to the whole nation, what has become
of the monarchy ? The decrees of the national assembly have cen
tered in themselves all the royal power ; the seal of the state has
been deposited on their table ; their decrees are rendered execu
tory without requiring fan&ion ; they give direfl orders to all
the agents of the executive power; they iinpofe, in their own
name, oaths, in which Frenchmen do uot even find the name of
their king ; commiflioners, who have received their million from
them alone, traverse the provinces, in order to receive oaths which
they exatt, and give dire&ions to the army ; thus at the moment
at which the inviolability of the king was annulled, monarchy
wasdeftroyed; the appearance of royalty no longer exists : a re
publican interim.
" Far from all those, who are acquainted with the rules of our
conduct [and, we believe, there are very few Frenchmen who do
not rightly appreciate them] be the idea that we could concur
in such decrees. They are not less unpleasant to our feelings than
repugnant to our principles.âNeverhavc we more fevcrely felt
the rigor of our duty ; never have we more lamented the fatal
consequences resulting from the miflion with which we were
charged, than when forced to remain witnesses of acts, which we
regarded as culpable attempts, while those who are mod frequent
ly our organ, become timid, for the firft time condemned them
selves to silence, that they might not involve the faered cauffe in
that unpopularity which hasfo ingeniously been contrived to be
thrown upon our party. Without doubt, if we were guided by
common rules ; if we yielded to the horror with which we were
inspired by the idea of being thought to approve, by our presence,
decrees to which we were so averse, we would fly without delay ;
we would without hesitation separate from an assembly, who have
been able to break through principles which they had been forced
to preserve. But in circumstances so similar, we can neither as
sume common rules, nor our own sentiments as the bias of our own
condutt. When our principles, our honor, may perhaps in the
opinion of a great number, command us to fly, motives more im
perious still exaÂ£b of us a painful facrifice, that of remaining, in a
situation where we preserve the hope of preventing greater evils.
" Before the calamitous epoch at which we are arrived, we
could at least grasp the shadow of monarchy : we fought upon the
wreck ; the hope of preserving it juftified our conduct. Now,
the last blow has been given to monarchy ; but in addition to that
great motive, we were bound by other duties. The monarch ex
ists, he is captive ; it is for the King's fake that we ought to rally
our strength ; it is for him, it is for his family, it is for the preci
ous blood of the Bourbons, that we ought to remain at the post,
where we can watch over a deposit so valuable.
" We will discharge then this sacred duty, which alone ought
be our excufe,and we will prove, that in our hearts the monarch
and the monarchy can never be separate.
" But whilst we comply with this urgent duty, let not our con
stituents expect to hear us come forward on other fubjcÂ£ts. While
one interest only can force us tb fit with those who have raised a
mis-shapen republic upon the ruins of monarchy, it is to that in
terest alone that we are wholly devoted. From this moment, the
mod profound silence, on whatever (hall not relate to this fubjedt,
(hall express our deep regret, and at the fame time invariable op
poiiticn to every decree that niay be passed.
" In fine, let our constituents turn their attention to the cir
cumstances in which we arc placed ; if, in the present moment we
have not gloried in marching toremoft in the path of honor, our
situation now imposes both with regard to them and to ourselves,
duties which do not go beyond ourselves alone. For us, honor
lies no 1 onger in the common track ; our sole objeÂ£l is ihe triumph
of thefacred cause with which we are entrusted : But let them be
beforehand assured, ihat whatever may happen, to whatever ex
tremities we may be reduced, nothing wiil efface from our hearts
the unalterable oath which irrevocably binds us to the monarch
and to monarchy.
" After these confutations, which appear to us founded upon
the true interest of the nation, and the eternal advantage of the
people, essentially dependent on monarchy, wc declarc to all
Frenchmen :
" That alter having constantly opposed all the decrees, which
in attacking Royalty, either in its eiTence or in its privileges, have
prepared the people to receive without indignation, as without ex
amination, the anti-monarchical principles to which thefc days of
anarchy have given birth :
" That after having defended till the last moment, monarchy,
undermined in its foundations :
lt That afjer hiving seen its ruin completed by the deliberations
of the National AfTembly; for to attack, the person of the monarch,
is to annul monarchy ; to suspend monarchy, is in fine to destroy
it :
" Nothing can authorise us any longer to take part in delibe
rations, which become in our eyes guilty of a crime which we do
not wifhto participate.
" But that monarchy existing in the person of the monarch,
from whom it is inseparable; that his misfortunes and those of
his augtift family impofmg upon us a stronger obligation always
to surround his august pet fori and defend it from the application
of principles which we condemn ; we place our sole honor, our
most sacred duty in defending with all our might, with all our
zeal for the blood of the Bout bons, with all our attachment to the
principles which our constituents have transmitted to us, the in
terest of the king, and the royal family, and their indefeafible
rights.
" That in consequence, we (hall continue, from the sole motive
ef not abandoning the intcrelts of the person of the king, and the
royal family, to alfift at the deliberations of the National AfTem
bly; but being neither able to avow their principles, or recognize
the legality of their decrees, we will henceforth take no part in de
liberations which have not for rheir objedt the only intercft which
it now remains lor us to defend."

ALBANY, September 5,
We have the pleasure of now being able to inform the public
that from the survey lately made by the Surveyor General of the
intended jun&ion oi the waters of Lake-Champlain and the North
River, it appears that that object will be much more easily ac
compliftied than could be expe&ed. The whole distance from
Fort-Edward to the Wood-Creek not exceeding 6 miles, nearly
one half of which being up the creek that empties into the Hud
son at Fort-Edward, and can be made navigable with a little ex
pence, the remainder of the dillance being nearly on a perfe6t le
vel, without a single spot of intervening high-ground, and having
every circumstance in its favor to facilitate the opening of a canal.
The advantages which will arise from opening this avenue of
trade, from the northern parts of the state, mud strike every one
in so obvious a point of view, that we trnft our leg'.flature will, at
their next meeting, embrace those favorable opportunities which
nature has pre fen led, and make provision for putting it into exc-
cution.
N E W-Y O R K, September is.
A correspondent who has just arrived in town from Philadel
phia, in justice to the hoyt of that city and ils liberties, declaresâ
that tho' he traversed the Itreets by night and by day, thoroughly
and universally, generally and paiticularly, on foot and on horse
back, in fair weather and in foul, he did not meet with any of
those formidable battalions of the " Rising generation," which
arc spoken of with so many alarming circumftsnces of terror and
affright in some length) paragraphs o! one of their late papers j
and that excepting a small cut in the face, from the carelessness
of a barber's boy, near Pewter-platter alley (w'no was /having him
by candle light) he received no injury whatever either in his flefli
or bones, his goods or his chattels, from those far famed combina
tions of puerile light infantry. He was well informed that the
few instances of outrage that have been committed, have chiefly
arisen frorp the want of a little common resolution on the pait of
such gentlemen as have been attacked ; and, upon the whole, he
is convinced from his own as well as from the experience of ma
ny pet (ons of his acquaintance, that there is no city in the United
States where a man may conduct his frail tabernacle thro' the
flreets in greater fafety, than in the celebrated metropolis known
by the name of Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, September 17.
FURTHER EUROPEAN ACCOUNTS,
By the Hope, arrived at New-York.
THE Anniversary of the French Revolution was Celebrated in
many parts of England and Ireland. At the Crown and Anchor
Tavern, London, nearly a thousand persons were alTemblcd and
dined together on this occasion. A number of patriotic toasts
were givenâAn Ode, written by Mr. Merry, was recited, and
the following Stanzas, accompanied by a band of music, sung in
the gallery by Mr. Sedgwick : â
FILL high the animating glass,
And let the elettric ruby pass
From hand to hand, from foul to foul;
Who shall the energv controul,
Exalted, pure, reftn'd,
The Health of Human lyind.
Not now a venal tribe shall raise
The song of prostituted praise,
To fov'reigns who have feiz'd their power ;
But at this gay, this iib'ral hour.
We blcfs what Heaven defign'd,
The Health of Human kind.
We turn indignant from each cause
Of man's difmayâfrom partial lawsâ
From Kings who vainly seek by flight
To shun the blaze of moral light;
We bless what Heaven defign'd,
The Health of Human kind.
CHORUS.
Assert the hallow'd Rights which Nature gave,
And let your last best vow be, Freedom or the Grave.
The ensuing Toajis were :
The Sovereignty of the People, a&ing by a free representation
in every nation.
The increased, increasing and sacred flame of LIBERTY.
PerfeÂ£l Freedom, instead of Toleiation, in matters of Religion.
The Liberty of the Press.
The Trial by Jury, and may the Rights of Jurymen to protest
the innocent, for ever remain inviolate.
The Literary chara&ers who have vindicated the Rights of
Man, and may genius ever be employed in the cause of Freedom.
THANKS TO MR. BURKE FOR THE DISCUSSION HE HAS
PROVOKED.
An address was thert delivered to the company by a French
gentleman of diftinÂ£lion : After which, the company separated
and retired home. In the evening some boys went about calling
for lights, which were however soon extinguished by orders from
the Magistrates.
At Belfaft, in Ireland, the day was celebrated by the Volunteers
and inhabitants at large, and by the Northern Whig Club âand
the day palled in great conviviality and tranquility. The inhabi
tants walked in proceflion through the town. After dinner a
great number of toasts and fcntiments were givenâand a declara
tion highly approbating the Revolution of France unanimously
agreed to, and voted to be sent to the National Aflembly. In the
toasts drank at the patriotic meetings in England and Ireland, the
United States, and those eminent chara&ers who have borne a
conspicuous part in effecting the Independence of our country, are
never forgotâbut are always mentioned with peculiar refpeft.â
The anniversary of the grand Confederation was celebrated with
eclat in Paris, and the city splendidly illuminated.
There are accounts in the London papers received via France,
that the British army in India has defeated Tippoo Saib. The
Britifn army consists of 23,000 fighting menâthe followers ex
ceed 200,000. The ground it covers in its march in general ex
tends Bor 9 miles. The Empress of Ruflia is said to be danger
ously sick. The negociations for peace between the Empiefs, the
Empetor, and the Grand Seignior, having been broken off, hosti
lities have again commenced. v The last Englifii meflenger from
Peterfburgh brought no definitive intelligence. The Englifti naval
armament is still continued.
The English papers also contain a memorial from the Prince of
Conde to the National Assembly, in answer to the Decree of nth
June. In which he fays, " France (hall never again behold me,
so long as reason and justice are banished from her, and so long as
she is the prey of the faflious who mislead her."âAlso a letter
from the officers of M. Bouille's army at Luxemburg; in which
they fay, " We swear upon our honor (the only thing that re
mains to us) that we will die for the deliverance of our King."â

The ceremony of translating the body of Voltaire to the French
Pantheon, was attended with great pomp and solemnity, on the
11th July.
The last advices from Germany (under the London head of
July 19) seem to confirm the idea of peace being soon established.
With mobs and infurreftions we generally aflociate the idea of
Tyranny and Oppression on the part of the Governmentâbut
when riots and outrages are committed on those who arc advo T
catcs for a reform in the abuses of government, we may well ex
claimâ" The woild's turn'd upside down."
There is one idea however connected whh this business that may
be of use, and that is, that mobs may be excited without any, as well
as by a just cause.
As the several accounts received of the late riots in Birming
ham bear one and the fame complexion, and are accompanied
with no extenuating circumstances, it may justly be expeftcd that
the whole truth is not yet told
In Birmingham the great mass of the inhabitants are manufac
turers and artisansâhundreds, perhaps thoufarjds ol them, are de
pendant for their daily employment on a few individualsâthe
apprehensions probably excited in their minds, that the preva
lence of French revolution principles would in their operation un
hinge the present regulations ot government, and throw them out
ol immediate employ, and confequcntly deprive them of subsist
ence, gave rife to their opposition to the celebration of the anni
versary of French Freedom.
To fay that the agency of government was employed on this
occasion, amounts to the fame as faying that either the people are
mobbifhly attached to the government, or that the government
pofleffcd in this instance an influence or power equal to controuU
mg the popular opinion.
It may be perhaps fafely aflerted, that no judgment can be
formed of the predominant fcntiments of the people of England,
from the Birmihghain fampleâ-for it is probable that, had the
mobility in other places been excited to rife, a very different dc
fcription of chara&ers would have been fufrerers.

The following beautiful ODE was fang at Liverpool at the celebratlcrt
of the Anniverfdry of 14th July.
O'ER the vine-cover'd hills and gay regions of France,
See the Day-dar of Libeity rife ;
Thro' the clouds of dejra&ion, unwearied, advance,
And hold its new courfc thro' the skies.
An effulgence so mild, with a lustre so bright,
All Europe, with wonder, surveys ;
And from defarts of darkness, and dungeons of night,
Contends for a share of the blaze.
Let Burke, like a bat, from its splendor retire,
A splendorâtoo strong for his eyes ;
Let pedants, and fools, his effufions admire,
Intrapt in his cobwebs, like flies :
Shall frenzy, and fophiflry, hope to prevail
Where reason opposes her weight;
When the welfare of millions is hung in the scale,
And the balance yet trembles with fate ?
Ah who 'midst the horrors of night would abide,
That can taste the pure breezes of morn ;
Or who, that has drank of the crystalline tide,
To the feculent flood wou'd return ?
When the bosom of beauty the throbbing heart meets,
Ah who can the transport decline ?
Or who that has tasted of Liberty's Sweets,
The prize, but with life, wou'd resign ?
âBut 'tis o'erâhigh Heav'n the decision approvesâ
Oppreflion has struggled in vain ;
To the Hell she has form'd, Superstition removes,
And Tyranny bites his own chain.
In the records of Time a new iEra unfolds, â
All Nature exults in its birthâ
His Creation, benign, the Creator beholds,
And gives a New Charter to Earth.
O catch its high import, ye winds, as ye blow!
O bear it, ye waves, as ye roll!
From regions that feel the fun's vertical glow,
To the fartheft extremes of the pole.
Equal Rights, equal Laws to the nations around,
Peace and Friendship its precepts impartâ
And wherever the footileps of Man shall be found,
May he bind the Decree on his heart.
ExttaElof a letterfrom Danville.Kentucky, via Richmond, dated Aug. 22.
" An express from Gen. Wilkinfon has this moment reached
this place, informing of his success. He has destroyed a large In
dian town situated on the Wabafh; also a Kickapoo town, con
taining about 30 houses, and killed and taken 42 of the enemy.
His loss, 2 men killed and one wounded, I have not as yet heard
where the express left him, but expect he has re-pa fled the Ohio
before this time."
When it is coniidered that there are in France three millions of
citizen-foldicrs, all armed in defence of the Constitution, the hopes
of success in attempts to effect a counter-revolution must be built
on a very slender foundation.

ARTICLE VII
Ths King, or Exccutivs sower.
r T~*nE inoft perfect government cannot exill or
X lalt without an effectual executive power.
The happiness of the nation depends 011 jult laws,
but the good clients of laws flow only from their
execution. Experience has taught us, that the
neglecting this eflential part of government has
overwhelmed Poland with difaticrs.
Having, therefore, secured to the Polish nation
the right of enacting laws for themselves, tiie
fuprcine infpeetion over the executive power,and
the choice of their niagiitrates, we entrujt it, the
King and his Council, the highejl psiver cj executing
the Ijwj.
This Council (hall be called Straz, or the Coun
cil of InfpetKion.
The duty of such execuiive power shall be to
watch over the laws, and to fee them ltrittly ex
ecuteJ according to their import, even by the
means of public force, fhouJd it be necellary.
All departments and magistracies are bound,
to obey its directions. To this power we leave
the right of controling such as are refractory, or
of puni/hing such as are negligent in'the executi
oii of their refpettive offices.
This executive power pannot alluine the light
of making laws, or of their interpretation. It is
expressly forbidden to contract public debts ; to'
alter the repai tition of the national income as fix
ed by the Diet ; to declale war ; to conclude
definitively any tieaty, or any diplomatic act ; it
is only allowed to carry on negociaiions with fo
reign Courts, and facilitate temporary occurren
ces ; always with reference to the Diet.
The Crown of Poland w? declare to be elec
tive in regard to families, and it is fettled lb for
ever.
Having experienced the fatal cffetfls of inter
regna, periodically subverting government, and
being desirous of preventing forever all foreign
influence, as well as of insuring to every citizen
a perfect tranquility, we have, from prudent mo
tives, resolved 16 adoi>t, hereditary fuccedion to
our Throne, therefore we enact and declare,that,
after the expiration of ojir life, according to the
jjracious will of the Almighty, the prelent Elec
tor of Saxony lhall reign over Poland.
The dynasty of the future Kings of Poland
lhall begin in the person of Frederick Angultus,
Elector of Saxony, with the right of inheritance
to the Crowrt to his male defceiidants. Tiie el
dest son of the reigning King is to fucreed his
father ; and in cafe the present Elec'tor of Saxony
lias no male ilT'ue, a htifband choleu by him
the'eonfent and approbation of the Republic) for
his daughter,fhall begin the laid dynalty. Hence
we declare thac'the Priricels Mary-Augufla Ne
pom upena, only daughter of the Elector of Saxo
ny, to be infanta of Poland.
We reserve to the nation, however, the right
of electing to the throne, any other houfo or fa
mily, after the extinclion of the firft.
Every King, on his acceilion to the throne,(hall
take a solemn oath to God and the nation, tol'up
port the prefenc Conllitution, to fulfil the patta
conventa, which will be fettled with the present
Eleflor of Saxony, as appointed to the crown,
and which shall bind him in the fame manner as
former ones.
The King's person is sacred and inviolable ; as
no a (ft can proceed immediately from, him, he
cannot be in any manner refp.jnfible'to the nati
on ; he is not an absolute monarch, but the fa
ther, and the head of the people ; his revenues
as fixed by thepatta couvtnta, shall be sacredly
preserved. All public arts) the ads of inagillra
eies, and the coin of the kingdom, lhall bear his
name.
who ought to poflefs every power
of doing good, shall have the right of pardoning
thole that are condemned to death, except the
