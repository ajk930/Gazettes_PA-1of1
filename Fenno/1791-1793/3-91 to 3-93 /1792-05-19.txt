FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER.
Mr. Dunlap,
AS Corner Stones to public buildings are merely intended
for the information of pollcrity, when their ruins may be
searched, to trace their antiquity, nothing should be handed
down by the press, which, profeffing to be authentic, is an in
correct relation of a fart. Your paper of this morning, con
tain?, as a reader would be apt to suppose, a copy of the in
scription on the corner stone of the President's house, taken
by a person who had feeti it.
I will take the liberty ofprefenting you tvith a true copy,
taken from the stone as it lay in the stone cutter's shop. That
the inscription you have been pleased to give is not superior to
that on the stone, I will not after t; but as old Hearne, tfye an
tiquarian, would have deemed it an unpardonable deviation,
if chance had presented to his view an antique falfely delcrib
cd by a writer cotemporary with the artist, I would gladly
screen you from the Hearnes of future days. The true in
scription is as follows : {( This Corner Stone, of the House to
accommodate the President of the United States, was laid,
May 10, 1792 : when Pennsylvania was happily out of debt;
Thomas Mifflin then Governor of the State/'

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
SATURDAY, March 31.
In committee of the whole on the report of th; Secre
tary of th: Treafnry on the public debt ; the fijib
proportion reported by the feletl committee refpells
a further assumption of the State debts, was read.
MR. GERRY ofFered a few remarks on the
fubje<ftâand urged the jallice and found
policy of compleating a buiinefs which had
for reasons well known, been left in an unfin
ilhed state ; but which equity and precedent
now called 011 Congress to finifh.
Mr. Clark was opposed to the proposition
Mr. Hartley : After so long a difculfion my
attempting to take up any great length of time
would not be excusable, but I consider it my
duty ro fay a word or two in answer to some
expreflions and observations ui'ed against the con
stitution and operation of this government ; and
give a few realons why I (hall now vote for the
resolution under consideration.
it will not be necellary for to rake into view
the principles upon which the constitution was
framed ; they were fully examined in the ge
neral convention as well as the several State con
ventions, ank ltood the test of the ftridteft scru
tiny. They are favorable to liberty and justice.
As to tlie operation of the government we
may best understand it, by contrasting the state
of America at the adoption of the constitution
with the present day. At the former period our
credit as United States of America was at a low
ebb. Few of the individuals of foreign coun
tries would give a credit to the individuals of
this. The capitals of Europe would not be trust
ed in America.âThey doubted our justice as
well as our government ; there was scarcely any
credit given to individuals here ; a nniverfal
diftrull prevailed. Agriculture languiflied ; the
farmer diffidentâhe had loft his confidence ;
the great fpuv to indultry was wanting.âNo
(hips on our flocks, few veflels in your harborsâ
commerce decoyed ; the vital spirit loft. I might
fay moreâbut I will turn from a difigreeable
scene to one more pleasing.
What is our present (late ? The credit of our
government is as good as that of any country.
Individuals of all nations will trust the individu
als of America. Individuals here (until a late
unfortunate bubble or abuse of credit, arising
from bad men or bad management and which
will poflibly only do hurt for the moment) gave
full credit to each other as far as their capitals
extended, as well in the city as in the country
and confidence prevailed.
Agriculture where the people are indtiftrions
and apply their attention to the raifiug of thole
articles which are most in demand, is in the
highest improvement ever known here before
I can speak with confidence of the State I live in.
The idle and indolent can expert no great
cess in an art which depends upon the (teady
hand of industry.
There are ships on the stocks in every part
where there are fliip-builders and materials. The
tonnage 1i 11 will evidence the mighty increase
of the American shipping ; It has far exceeded
the most sanguine expectation. Several of the
firft merchants state your commerce in a molt
refpedtable situation far beyond any other pe
riod. Indeed, the returns from the Secretary
of the Treasury (hew la iw great our imports and
how vad our exports.
In point of juitice our reputation (lands high
with the world. Our courts will do justice.
Pray what foundation for thole llrong afler
tions which have been made against
tution and the government ?
As to the funding system I shall fay little at
present. I much doubt if it deserves' the hard
names which have been given it. Abuses will
be committed in ail countries ; no human plan
can be secure against them.
The afl'umption of the State debts was fully
considered upon a former occasion. Severkl of
us wilhed to fund the debt of the union alone,
many gentlemen of the south when we came to
look for ways and means, voted against us, and
the eaftei n 1 eprefentatives were always ready
to join in defeating us, unless the aflumptiou of
State debts also rook place.
The bill pad the House of Representatives for
funding the debt of the union alone; but the
Senate lent it back with an amendment aHinninn
State debts to a certain amount. After much ar
gument the amendment of the Senate was agreed
to by the House of Representatives. Jufticewas
nearly done to some States ; others do complain
and 1 think Rhode-Island with much real'oii.
I could have wiftied that the accounts between
the United States and the several States had been
fettled. But I will give the gentlemen who
complain so much, an opportunity of fatisfying
this house (if they are able) when the blanks are
to be filled up in the bill, that the funis they de
mand-are reasonable and are intended to give re
lief to the people of their States.
1 will vote for the resolution
Mr. Find i-e y, in answer, faicl :âlf I am not
altogether so elated with our present profperitv
and resources, as my worthy colleague who is
jult (at down, laffure you 1 am not despond
ing 1 think our relources are competent,
and our circunidances not deprefled ; the great
indultry of our citizens, and the great de
mand and high price for our produce in foreign
markets, which took place about two years ago,
gave a spring to our wealth and industry, and
fornilhed ample resources to government ; our
feelings have not been pierced with the cries of
general distress, nntil very lately, through the
abuse of the novel principles introduced in the
funding system.
But though I rejoice with the gentlemen 111
the fufficiencv of our means, yet I consider our
selves in the (ituation of an unexperienced heir,
newly come to the enjoyment of a great estate,
who, being dazzled with his own splendor, and
confident of his means, sets about spending with
out fyltem or principles, and gets embarrafied
before he is aware.
We are told, that the principle of afluming
the State debts is already admitted by the lalt
Congress, therefore it ought to be completed
now ;we are juit told, too, that it was fully con
sidered there.
lafkrhen, Why was not the bnfinefs fully
complered at that timeâif it was not, then what
good reason can be given for carrying it further
now ?âls there any new discovery of better
rules to apportion by, or is the distress of the
States who have yet some unaffumcd debt, as
prefling as when they had to bear the burthen of
three or four millions more than now ? Gentle
men knew that the length thisbufinefs has gone
already, has given great uneasiness to those
States who made the grea eft exertions to extin
gui(h their own debts, and to whose circumltan
ces and feelings the resources applied to the as
sumed debts of the States, are diflreifing and
disagreeable.
For what purpose are the commifijoners em
ployed in adjusting the accounts between the in
dividual States and the United States, if the
whole of the State debts were to be afl'umed pre
vious to that settlement ? We know the govern
ment is not vested with powers to compel delin
quent States to do justice, and that if ever justice
is done to those States who have extinguished
their own debt, it must be by iiicreafing of the
general revenue in proportion to the money
Congress will have to pay to those States, and it
is an unjuflifiable and dangerous policy to draw
the money from the people with the one hand,
to pay ir to the state governments with theother.
I have such information as 1 can depend upon,
that the commissioners will report upon the final
settlement of the State debts, in the-courfe of
next winter ; and the resolution before the com
mittee makes no provision for interefl until af
ter the year 1792. Why then take this further
leap in the dark, when those States who will be
actually entitled to it, will be as soon relieved
according to the principles of justice, as thev
would be by diltributing the public property in
this manner by rule of thumb.
T always thought the afiumption of the State
debts a meafnre which the constitution did not
contemplate, and which had a tendency to sow
the feeds of discontent in many parts of the Uni
ted States, and now it is argued that the piece
dent being set by the last Congress we ought to
copy it :â 1 admit of no principles of infallibi
lity in Congressâand if precedents produce an 1
obligation, we ought to be the more careful ncft
to (trengthen them by repeating such as are im
proper or doubtful. The only plausible reaf'ow
for afluming the State debts in the last Congress
so far, was to ease the burthen of such States as
had been mod backward in providing for their
refpedive debts, so as that they might be able
to provide for what remained until I he accounts
would be fettled, and to make some provision
for the Srates who had done much to extinguish
their debt as a security that the debts would be
brought to a final settlement. Certainly tliofe
Srates, at whose desire, and for wbofe conven
ience so much has been done, ought to have a
little more moderation.
Mr. Madison observed, that a great deal had
been laid to prove that the general government
is under obligation to provide for the debts of
the individual States : The gentlemen who
maintain this opinion said he, have not shewn
that the creditors themselves ever entertained
an idea that they fliould look to the United

anon of . lie creditors-they It and precifel, "
the lame ground they did under the old confe.
deration. Mr. Madison denied that in"the for
tner aflumption the creditors of the individnal
States were considered in the fame point of light
as the creditors of tile continent, and for the
truth of this he appealed to thelaw itfelf " ma k
ing provition for the public debt."
The proposition now before the committee he
confiderekl as unjust as it would place fume of
the States which had made no exertions to ctif
charge its debts, in a more eligible fi'uatiuu
than those winch had made the greatelt exer
tions to efFetft that objetft. He denied that the
"rlt aflumption had been generally approved or
had heen acquieiced inâand adverted to'the
proceedings and resolutions of the State of Vir
ginia on the fubjetft j papers (aid he, are on the
table to (hew the truth of what is now aflerted â¢
he added that he was sorry to find that 110 more
attention had been paid to those papers. Mr
Madison then noticed the slate of imports and ex
ports from the several States, to ftiew the une
qual operation of the aflumption as it affetfts
those States, particularly Virginia,which pays f 0
great an overproportion of the interest on the
debts of some of the States.
Mr. Gerry stated a variety of instances to shew
that the debts of the individual States were al
ways considered as founded ultimately on the
faith of the union ; that the creditors had ta
ken the paper of the States on that ideaâthat
the States were considered as agents for the Uni
ted Statesâand on this principle the contracts
for l'upplies and services on a continental ac
count had been which the war
must have ceased, and the subjugation of the
United States have followed.âMr. Gerry re
marked on the partiality and evident injolticeof
leaving the pofleflbrs of the remainder of the
state debts totally unprovided for.
The qneltion on agreeing to this proportion
was carried in the affirmative this day, 5? to 2J
but was eventually loft.

" The prodigious and progreliive fall of the

in Europe, is but too true n consequence of the
immense decay of credit, which mult e-ifue from
the fort of chimerical government under which
we live at present, in our way to the better fort
of government we were promised by this afton
idling revolution. âIt will come no doubt ; but,
in my opinion many eflential changes in thepre

take place ; till then it will be the lotos the present
generation to be totfed about on a very rough
sea indeed.
" Tlie relotn'ce of afTignats, which consider

country, finee they actually enabled the National
Aflentbly to do at Jeaft one whole year without
taxes, independent of the redemption of a great
part of the debt ; those aflignats, I fay, have
proved poison in the hands of the weak and the
wicked ; for inflead of using them sparingly and
temporarily as a gift from heaven, to fiin/h and
fettle the conftitntion, they have leaned on then
as on a very convenient pillow, and cared much
less about reltoring proper force to government,
which wai, however the only certain means of
enforcing the payment of taxes. They go on
digging into the mine till at la(t they find the

ABSTRACT OF FOREIGN NEWS.
A foip arrived at New-York on Tuesday, in 39 days from
Glasgow, by which European accounts are received to the
29th MarchâThese fay, that incredible quantities of all kinds
of ammunition daily arrive at Namurâ-That the Emperor of
Germany died suddenly in the arms of his wife, at Vienna, the
firft of March, of an inflammation in the lungs and bowelsâ
subsequent articles in the Engliih papers fay that he was taken
o;f bv poifon âthe lufpicion tails on various defcnptions of
perronsâthe Monks, the Brabanters, the Emigrants, and the
Jacobins, are mentioned âprobably all innocent but the great
inuft have something extraordinary to kill them. Immediately
on the Emperor's decease, his foil Francis "took the reins of
government in the Austrian Monarchyâthe garrison of Vlenna
took the oaths to the eldest foil of the Emperor two days after
lik father's death.
March 16. Medals made of the iron bolts of the Baihlewere
presented to the members of the Legislative Aifembly. When
the Queen of the French heard of the death of her brother the
Emperor, Ihe said, " If my misfortunes were not before at
their height, their measure would now lie filled."
Reports of every kind are in circulation in Paris great
tommotions are said to exist in Flanders. â The day after the
news of t! " Emperor's death was received, the fifh-women
were marching to ptefent a pike to the Queen; they were
flopped however by the guard.âAccounts ei e received that
Aries, Carpentras and Avignon, were in a state of open re
volt ; the anti-revolutionists had driven away or imprisoned
all tl'e patriots. âM. Dumourier is appointed French Minister
for foreign affairs, and M. Lacofte, Minister of Marine.
Count Florida Blanca, Prime Minister of Spain, has been ar
retted, and afterwards exiled, and his papers fealcd. M.
D'Aranda is his fuccefTor.
An express over land arrived at the India-House, London,
the 24th MarchâThe intelligence is said to be, that Lord
Cornwallis took Seringapatam by storm on the 15th Novembei
last. His loss said to be 433 Europeans, and 7000 natives.â
That Genera! Meadows was killed, and Lord Cornwallis
wounded. India Stock rose 2 per cent. r This turned out
to be a hum.}
The new King ftf Hungary, it is fait!, in letters from Vienna,
of the sth March, had countermanded the troops that were
marching, and had declared that he wo*dd have no concern in
the disturbances of France. âThe Prince Royal of Denmark
has published aji arret, by which the slave-trade is to cease,
and be forever abolished after 1803.
The beginning of March an earthquake was felt in several
parts of Englandâsome old houses were ftiaken down, but no
lives loft.
By the shin Brothers, Capt. Anderfon, arrived here in seven
weeks fromLifbon, accounts are received that Doaor Willis
had arrived there from Englandâfound the Queen in a very
alarming situationâ âbut his treatment of her, had been attend
ed with very favorable fymptoin* â*"he Oueen having lo far
recovered when Capt. Anderfon fnilcd, as to lecognize those
about her person. The Doctor will doubtless meet a suitable
reward.
The PrincÂ£ Recent has acquired great reputation for the
affectionate attention paid by him to his mother in the course
of her illness; having constantly fliewn the most solicitous

WAR BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN.
Captain W. A. Perry arrived at Marblehead on Sunday
night last from St. Martins, which place he left the 16th of
April, and brings the following important intelligence.
That the dav he failed, a brig arrived from St. Lucie, the
master of which (James Green) informed Capt. Perry, among
manv other gentlemen in the public coffee-houfe in that place,
that an Englifti man of tvar arrived at St. Lucie the day be
fore he left it, the commander oi which informed the French
Commodore there, that WAR was declared between France
arid Spain. This intelligence was communicated by Captain
Green in the molt public manner, so that no doubt ol its truth
wai entertained at St. Martins.
[This news was repeated by an arrival at this port from
St. Xitts, but is most probably premature.]
The Pre fide nt of the United States arrived at Baltimore last
Saturday eveningâhe pursued his route on Monday following.
We are informed that very large sales of lands, the property
of this state, have been recently madeâand fold on such prin
ciples, and in such quantities as will induce a speedy populati
on of the fame. Such is the present situation of affairs inmost
of the European States, that we may reasonably expert great
emigrations to this asylum of freedom.

nor, and the Hon. Oliver Wolcott Lieutenant Governor of

At the General Election at Newport, on the 2d instant,
his Excellency Arthur Fenner, Esq. was chosen Governor,

Morse's Geography is printed in London on fine wove
paper.
The Onartermafter-General of the state of MafTachufetts
(fays a late Boston paper) has employed Col. Revere, of that
town, to cast sixteen brals field-pieces, for the use of the Artil
lery of that state.
The last Pittlburgh Gazette, received by post yesterday,
contains no account of any recent depredations of the In-
dians.
Extrad of a letter from a gentleman in Havannah to his friend
" The famous Mr. Bowles and thrtc of the principals of
the Creek Nation were brought in here a few days sinceâMr.
Bowles was conduced to the Moro, where he now remains,
and it is thought the depredations he has committed on the
Spanifli settlements will cost him his life. It is reported that
he was in the action against St. Clair."
The facts contained in the article entitled, " Reflections
on the State of the Union," copied into the G. U. S. from the
American Museum, are a complete refutation of the principal
(landers on the people and their government, which constitute
the celebrity of some publications.âN. B. All forts of weapons
are allowable in a cause, the advocates of which, stick at no
thing.
A correspondent observes, that the paragraph copied from
the National Gazette, in our last, refpefting counterfeit certi
ficates, is a specimen of the ftimfy foundation on which the
moll: formidable charges against public measures are raised.
Let it never escape the recolle&ion of the friends to the
union, that the persons who now oppose the government of the
United States, and its administration, are of the fame cut with
those who have kept the world in a state of fermentation thro'
all ages. "
As there never was, so there never will be a perfect system
of government âbut, that system ispofitively bad, fays Chro
nus, which X have no hand in administering.
In this countrv, the people made and uphold the government.
It lives and moves, and has its being from them. Their power
is seen and felt not only in revolutions which alter its form,
but in the ordinary arts of its administration. Not a particle
of authority is held but from them. They chufe the legisla
ture they make their voice heard after they have chosen
them, and if they concur in their wifties, the general sense is
obeyed. The government trusts the execution of the laws to
civil force, to the marfhaJ, and the people themselves called,
if necefTary, to his afliftance. They, as grandand petit jurors,
have the laws in their hands, and in effect, as well as in ap
pearance, wield the sceptre. They may be said, as truly as
any people on earth, to be a royal people. They are sove
reigns, and have already (hewn sense and prudence enough to
make us throw up our hats and (hout.âGod save the peopleâ
Long may they reign. This is no rant, but a truth which
even' American, unless degenerate, will glory in. But men
, are not wanting who dare to represent to the people this go
vernment as a despotism. The newspapers are (luffed with
licentious invectives as if they were aimed at the administra
tion of Turkey or Tippoo Saihâand all this while a man who
(lands unrepro&ched as well as unrivaled (its in the chair of
authority, while the nation prospers and grows in numbers, in
wealth, in refpeflability, while knowledge increases, and adds
something daily to the security of liberty and the means of
happiness. What will happen when adversity, to which all
nations are liable, (hall have (harpened the edge of discontent,
when personal rival(hips (hall have engendered and armed fac
tions with deadly hatred,when the little remnant of authority
left to government after these deductions, (hall be turned a
gainst itfelf, heaven, that disposes of men and their concerns,
and makes them the instruments to puni(h their own vice and
folly, only knows.

BLOOM SBURY,
THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
ot Trenton, in New-Jei fey, occupied for many years pad by
the fubfciiber ; containing upwards of 200 acres of land, bcfidt*
a traÂ£l of wood-land of abour 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two pans, nearlv
equal in quantity ; ihe eaflwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the said flreet on the east, and by the liver 011
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined effect of situ
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the mofk
beautiful and desirable feats in the Rate. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-finifbed brick, building, 50 bv 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellais, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new stone
coach-house and stables, fufficient. to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining these is a very complete granarv,
rat proof, and a stone cow-house, upwards of 100 feet in length,
containing thiriy-one paved stalls, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, Sec. Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is a gar
den of about two acres, expending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich collc&ion of the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large afparagut
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, weii
built, ifone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheese-room,
spring-house, garden, &c. a complete (tone smoke-house, corn
cribs, waggon-lioufe, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
cefrary out-building. The ground is properly divided into fmutt
fields, all well watered, highly impioved, and chiefly under the
moll approved grass. This square has produced annually, for fc
veral years part, upwards of sixty tons of the befl hay, besides
supporting through the summer season twenty to thirty homed
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper feafoos,
with great plenty of all kinds of fifti usually found in frefh water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both of which
m?y afford a plcafing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his tabic. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is iqclofed and divided
bv good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar ports,
and rails of chefnut and white cedar. The purchaser may have
the improved fquaic fcparately, or the whole together, as mav
best suit him. There is an inexhaustible quantity of good build
ing flone on the river (bore. The purchase money, if well secured,
and the interest punttualiy paid, will not be demanded foi many
years.
Any peifon desirous of viewing the piemifes, may be gratifi'd
on application to Samuel W. Stockton, Esq. of Tienton,
or Mr. Ikallman, who at present occupies the far m-houleand
part of the landâand may know the price on application to the
