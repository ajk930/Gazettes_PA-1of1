A DISCOURSE OF STEPHEN BOETIUS,
Concerning voluntas y Servitude : Or the Anti-One.
(Continuedfrom No. 4 of this Gazette.)
X7"OU sow the feeds of your fruits that he may
JL reap the harvest: You furniih and adorn
your lioufes,-^ provide materials for his robbe
ries : You your daughters, that he may
have the means of satiating hi s luxury: You feed
and cloath your children, to the end that he may
most graciously please to lead them to his wars
and conduct them to llauglner ; that he may make
them the minifiers of his avarice, and the execu
tioners of his vengeance : You break the conlli
tutions of your bodies with labor, that he may
fondle in delights, and wallow in his dirty vil
lainous pleal'ures: You weaken youifelves to
make him more itrong and rough, to hold you in
with a lhorter rein. And from all tliefe indigni
ties, which even the beasts ti.emfelves
ther not feel, or would not endure, you may
liver yourfeives, if you attempt it, not indeeoTn
action, but in volition. Be rei'olved to serve no
longer, and behold you will be free. 1 do not
exhort you to pull or to haul, but barely not to
lift and fupport,and you will fee him, like a great
Coloflus, from which they have removed the pe
deilal, fall to the ground by his own weight, and
crumble in pieces.
But certainly the advice of the physicians is
â¢wife, not to lay your hands on a wound that is
incurable; and I am not prudently employed in
attempting to advise the people, who have 101 l
Jong ago all knowledge, and whose malady is
evidenily mortal, because they feel not the evil.
Let us examine then, by conjeiSure, and fee if
we can dilcover how it is that this obllhiate ref>-
lution to serve has become fi> rooted, that itfeems
at present that the love of liberty is not fa natu
ral as the love of servitude.
11l the firft place, this is, as I think, beyond all j
doubt, that if we live with the rights which na
ture has given us, and the principles and doilrines
that <he reaches us, we Ihall be naturally obedient
to parents, fubjetfts to reason, and llaves to no
man. Every one will be difpoi'ed to obedience
to his father and mother, without any other ad
monition than that which his natural disposition
will didtate. All men are witnefles, every one
in himfelf and for himfelf, concerning reason,
whether it is born with us or not ; wiiich is a
queltion difcufied to its foundation by the acade
micians, and touched by all tne schools of philo
sophers. For the present, I (hall not think my
fejf miltaken in believing, that there is, in our
human foul, fonie natural feeds of reason, which,
cultivated by good council and conduct, manners
and habits, may flourifh in virtue : and, on the
contrary, frequently, not being able Jo support
itfelf againlt the vices which grow about it, being
choaked, becomes abortive. But certainly if
there is any thing clear and apparent in nature,
and to which it is not permitted us to be insensi
ble, it is this, that nature, the minilter of God,
and the go*ernefs of men, has made UQall of the
fame form, has call us all in the fame mould, to
the end that we may all mutually acknowledge
one another for companions, or rather as bro
thers. And if, in making the partition of the
pvefents which {he has given us, (he has given
some advantages of property, some powers of
body or faculties of mind, to some more than to
othersâ(he has not however intended to throw
us into this world as into a close paflure, for the
(honger to devour the weakerâlire has not sent
down here below the (trongeft and the molt

that distributing thus to some a larger portion,
and to others a smaller, (lie meant to give room
for the fraternal affection, that it might have op
portunity for exercise; some having the power
to afford alfiftance, and others, wants, to receive
it- Since then this kind mother has given us all,
the whole earth for a residenceâhas lodged us
all in the fame houseâhas moulded us all of the
fame clay, to the end that every one may behold
himfelf or his own in every otherâif (he

For all he feels, for all he cares,
And with unwearied toil goes on
To make, of sense, all mortals fellow-heirs.
And here, with honesty of foul, profeffes
That, notwithstanding many envious guefles
Of what his motives and his wishes were,
With pure difintereltednafs of spirit,
And charm'd, alone, with all Reviewers' merit,
He doth these several Hirts, with labor haid, prepare.
In troth, dear Critics, I have nought to hope
Or from your wisdom, or your wit;
Alike regardless Ihoula the honest rope
Adorn your necks, or decorate your spit.
I've wrote no Book, profound in ancient fazvs,
Which claims your praises, or your smiles requires ;
Nor does a Doctorate of Medicine, or Laws,
Fill me with Learning's never-dying fires,
Not only destitute of Title's aid,
Tofcreen my Writings from contempt, and traJJi,
But I despise all writingâas a tradeâ
And scorn, a hircling-fcribler beau, to slash,
Beside, unfortunate indeed forme,
This genius-barren foil has given me birth ;

Conclusion of an extraÃ of a letter from London, to
a gentleman in Salem, dated Jan. 3, 1791, begun

A rigor of the Navigation Ast in admitting no
veflels to be British but such as are actually built
within the dominions, is in this particular absurd
as well as impolitic, as by increaflng the cojl of
/hipping it lejfens the quantity and objtruclr the de
sign of increasing feamen âand that if government
should relax To far as to allow the free nurchafe
and life of veflels from the United States, the
British nation would gain the most solid advan
tagesâ bv having much cheaper vehicles they
could afford to carry cheaper ; and, carrying
cheaper, they would be employed in carrying
nior eâwhich neccfTarily m ult increase both /hip
ping and seamen. But. you will agree with me,
that nations, like individuals, are not easily in
duced to give up old habits, even when acknow
ledged to be bad ; and therefore that a very fid
dsn change is not to be expetfted. But be this as
it may, 1 think your investigation of the policy
of our Navigation Lawsmuftat last result in this'
that as a fyftenf of naval jlrength and defence for
this ljland, nothing could be more wise-âbut as a
febeme of profit or gain in any country nothing can be
more ABSURD. This conclusion being allowed,
yon will afk'whether commercial restrictions are
to be j'.iftified uiionno other ground than that of
providing and supporting. a naval power? To!
this qneftion f should anfver, that there may be
cases in which small, tenporary or particular re

â¢ ever is violent.and painful we ought tfl .be fa
tisfied of the reality of thedifeafe, and of its na
tore and extent, and also of the probability of a
cure, before we submit to the application of it.
I confefs 1 don't readily think of any general fyl
tem of commercial rertraint that can be fully vin
dicated, except such as an aggrieved nation may
form by way of retaliation upon an aggreflor, with
reafonablt hope oj obtaining redress. To retaliate
upon an offending nation (with refpe<ft to them)
can be no violation of jultice. To recover and
secure that equal freedom, which if enjoyed by
all would be universally beneficial, and to which
therefore on social principles all have a claim is
certainly no unworthy objed: ; but to render such
a mode of pursuing it confident with found poli
cy, there ought to be a good probability of pur
suing it with successâ" but there's ihe rub."
Our own history informs us of one experiment
at lealt that had an unfavorable issue : we are
told that, in the beginning of the reign of Kincr
Charles, France had laid i'uch heavy impositions
on our trr.de, that our annual loft was eflimated
at one and a'half or two millions lterling. Part
ly with the hope of recovering this, and partly
from animosity we retaliated by severe restraints
on the commerce with France ; but after much
fuffering, and finding no go',d effefis at all from our
rijiraints, in a succeeding reign vii prudently took
tkivi off.
" In tracing the progress ofinduftry you will
observe that " in every prosperous state the an-
nual earnings of the people exceed their annual
consumption." This excels in a regular course
of things accumulates to an enormous amount
Whether it be finall or great however is not of
any serious moment ; but it is of the I ast imp or -
tancc to society that there be a continual repro
duction of Jometking more than is immediately
coillumed. Now theconftant endeavor of every
individual to produce more than enough for his
own consumption depends upon his being able
to exchange the surplus for something he wants;
and the more he can getfurhis surplus rhegreat
er will be ins endcavoi s to mcreaie "iliac lurpTus.
Let it be othcrwifeâand take away this induce
ment from tht individual to produce more than
his own wants require, and it mult inevitably
happen, if the people ilo not absolutely perish,
they 111 uft at last Puffer all the-extremity of pinch
ing want. To be f;ire therefore of never falling
bel6w the mark of a fufticiency, it is necefl'ary
to aim always considerably above ir. Ilence the
advantage of a jr ee, easy and extenfivt market can
not be duly appreciated, as it holds out to the in
dividual an irrefiftable allurement to make his
surplus as great as podible. All these things how
ever will happen right in the ordinary operation
of natural principlesâno artificial fyftein what
ever can do as well. But perhaps you will urge
that while such fyftenis are pratftifed by nations
with whom you have intercourse, a fort of lie
ceffity is thereby created for you to do likeviifr.
This abfervation, as relates to some nations, is
fatisfatftory ; but the thing abstractedly consi
dered may be just, and yet impratfiicableâor it
may be practicable and yet inexpedient : the dil
eafe may be more tolerable than the remedyâ
orthefuccefs may be too uncertain. Nations
likeindividualsare, or ought to be, always laboring
to make their own particular condition better.
Like individuals, however, they sometimes lose
fight of the abundant good things they poflefs,
blinded by an intemperate zeal for fomerhing
which they want, or imagine they want. The- fun
damental cause of this is ufefulâbut this excefi
in the effect is pernicious. You commend the
Shepherd, who, leaving in fajety his ninety-nine
Jbeep goes to seek for one that has ftiaycd â but
if to recover a f mall part of a fwgt? fleece only ht
should weary and expose his whole flock, yos
would condemn his want of prudence as .well ?
â¢want of fenfibitity.
" Of all People I think yon have the leafl o
'cafion to try hazardous experiments in politics
k'oii have the most ample natural resources, tl
full advantage of which you cannot be deprived
by the contrivances of any foreign nation, unl.
your own imprudence and indiscretion should aid the.
I mention this because I have seen among you
\eagernef for prohibitions or restraints on the co
Lnierce with "this countryâ But as this biifi efÂ«
[momentous, it is to be hoped you will delibt
' ate coolly before you decideâcount fairly t
coit, and eltimare truly the endof the underta
ing before you begin itâthese preliminaries b
$ispÂ®rightly fettled, more uniformity, fleaainefs
and spirit may be expected in the execution. The
advantage you propose is the advancement of
your navigation interellâthis would probably be
obtained, if the measures should be well taken
and faithfully pursued on your part, and at the
fame tune quietly fvbmitted to by your Rivals. But
your good fenl'e must forefee that measures of
this kind, tho taken with foine moderation, may
soon iflue in at: interdict of all dirett trade be
tween you. Still you conceive the interest of
the British nation would fufferfomuch as to com
pel her to bend her commercial laws to what is
really the common interest of the two countnes.
But if your reliance is, that fnjferings will produce
concejfionsy you ought to calculate before hand
with some accuracy the force of this argument as
applied to yourselves as well as to us. Admit
ting however that after duly weighing all cou
fiderations the prepondei ance is so much in your
favor, as to bring success within the limits of
probability, let me ask whether any thing short
of moral certainty ought to tempt you, in the
present polture of affairs, to risque so much jor the
chance of gaining so little ? Belide, if the British
at present have the advantage of carrying more
of your produce than they ronfume, are you not
amply compensated by the immense purchases
they make of that produce? Do they not restore
to you as buyers all, and much more than all,
the wages they require as carriers ? and do not
both countries find a very great (if not perfectly
equal) advantage from their intercourse ? and
â would it be no shock to the great body of your
Cultivators and producers suddenly to banish one
halj of all the capital employed in purchasing
their surplus pf-odutftions ? Perhaps these ques
tions may be answered fatisfasftorily, and I shall
be told " that our necellity to buy is greater than
yours to fellâthat most of your commodities are
of the firft utility to various parts of the British
dominions, and that you are the greatest and
befl: customers for our manufactures." All this
and much more may be alledged with truth;
and believing it to be true, I maintain that with
these advantages on your fide you may fafely re
ly on a firm, but temperate and liberal policy, to
gain greater conceflions ultimately than can be
reasonably expected from any kind of violence.
Thisfeems the more prudent, as your population
and wealth are rapidly increasing, while the fre
quent interruptions of wars and alarms keep ours
stationary.âThe fvvorddrawn against Spain was
scarcely sheathed, when we were called to arm

its importance

FROM THE CONNECTICUT JOURNAL.
THE PROMPTER
When a man's name is up, he may lie abed till noon.
BUT the Prompter's name is not half upâhe
can therefore take a short nap only.
Our good country folks who talk English, when
they mean to fay a man's fame is spread abroad,
or his reputation extensively established, fay, his
nam: is up, or he has got his name up. How blefl'ed
is the man who has got his name up.
Every body knows how a certain aftrononier
got his name up for a great Almanack-maker, by
foretelling snow in the month of May. The
truth was, in the copy of his Almanack, in the
month of May, there happened to be a blank space
âhe call about for something to fill the blank
fpaceâfnoiu was the firft word that occurredâand
snow was written in the blank. Heaven, not by
accident, for Heaven has nothing to do with the
capricious things called accidentsâHeaven had
determined there ftiould be snow that yÂ«ar in
May, and snow there was, though the Almanack
tuaker had as little foreknowledge of this as his
horse-block. No sooner did it snow, but all the
â¢vyorld looked into the Almanack.â" La, (said
ttie world) our almanack tells ot snow at this
very time. This is a knowing manâhe is a gen
ius" What a lucky hit ! The man''s name -was
ipâno Almanack so good as hisâand while he
intinued to make Almanacks, Sir Isaac Newton
imfelfwould have ttarved upon Almanackmak
ng, within the fame of this mighty conjurer,
'hose Almanacks, by one mere guess, had got his
ame up and drove all competitors from the mar
ket: When this was done, he might lie abed
.11 uoon. A Jingle blunder before his name was
p, would have damned his Almanacksâafter
wards, fifty errors only gave credit to the work,
pr, fay the world, great, men may miltake, but
iiis man's name is up.
I have known a man get his name up by curing
ne belly ache, (excuse me, Sadies, for the ladies
n Philadelphia of the tip-top fnfhion call certain
oils of sweet cake by a much less delicate name)
with a powder of unknown composition.âAll at
once the Doiftoris sent for to cure the belly ache
âEven the boys who eat green apples mult have
the belly ache Doctor.âSkill, science, wisdom,
prudence, are all prostrated before the Doiftor
and his powder, if his patients die, no matter;
his name is up, and he will still have business.
It is a good thing to get one's name upâespeci
ally for curing fone disease that no body else can
cureâone that is commonly fatal. The more
terrifying the difetfe, the betterâas the consump
tion or cancers, for example. But the most de
legable way for the faculty to get up their
names, is, to adveitife as German doctors, topref
cribe for all diseases by inlperting a sample of
the waterâliulhâbut to receive bottles from all
quarters.
I once knew a (hopkeeper who got his name
up as a cheap trader. And did indeed fell cheap
âwondrous cheapâeven below sirs} cofi. He be
gan to trade with little capitalâfold goods for less
than he gaveâand yet grew rich. How can this
be ? The Prompter thinks it is very easy. That
article which every body wants and knows the
value of, fell very low ; even lower than firft cost
âget your name upâdraw all the world to your
shopâand then put double profit on other goods.
It is very easy and very common ; the greatest
blockhead can do this and make a fortune.
So when gets his name up he may re
tail all manner of nonsense, and it will find a
ready market in public opinion. A good Eflay
appears in the newspaperâwho wrote it ? Dr.
Franklin, it isfaid, wroteit. Well, itis like him
âit is a masterly produ<ftion. Some time after,
the real author appears to bea young man, who,
as the poet fays, is unknown to fame ; and as I fay,
whose name i< not upâimpoflible ! he cannot be
the author. Who ever heard of him before ? 1
am sure Dr. F or Gov. L helped hiinâ
In fa (ft his na?ne is tint up.
I was once travelling through a neighbouring
State, and enquiring for the best inns on the
road, was directed to a noted one, whose owner
had got his name up for the befl entertainment.â
He had a large house well partitioned into small
rooms for single lodgers. His stable was excel
lentâbut the cookery at his table was wretched
âmean indeedâl could eat nothing. But every
traveller would seek this noted innâhe would
ride half the night, and pass half a dozen better
bouses to get to this noted innâin faift the man
had got his name up and he might lie abed till
rtoon.
A young lady gets her name up for a beauty, or
a fortuneâall the world are sighing and dying
for her. Wit, sense, accomplishments all distin
guish herâbeaus hang round her, like flies about
a calk of sugarâsuddenly Ihe has a fit of sickness
âthe roCesoJi her cheei d'-'-ajrâit-is
she has no fortuneâher admirers draw offâ(he
is a clever girl, but she is not ft clever as 1 tho't
her.
I once knew a very sensible woman who took
a great fancy to names. One of her whims was
that her daughters should marry names beginning
with H. She could give no reason for her incli
nation but thisâshe had known several of her
neighbours who married men beginning with H,
and they all made good husbands. They were
not the greareft men, lhe said, but they were kind,
good natured husbands, and would fuffer any
thing rather than be offended. All the neigh
bourhood were in love with the letter Hânothing
would do for a husband, but this letter H, which
some squeamish grammarians will have to be no
letter. But the name of the letter was vp.
To conclude, a man by the name of Wafbing
ton some time ago palled through the village
where 1 live. This was soon knownâMr. Wa/h
---ington ! What, a relation of the President's ?
This indeed was not knownâbut every body
really thought he looked a little like the Presi
dent. All the world collected to get a peep at
him as he pa (Ted the window of his lodgings
every body bowed as he p.ifTedâevery body
looked and admired ! The man was indeed a ve
ry great scoundrelâbut he new human nature

the President's real letters of recommendation
could not have procured him more refpetft.

AS I .have been long absent from America, it happens that an
ignorance of many modern improvements, efpecialiy in lan
guage, fubjeft me to fomc very odd mistakes.
I lately called, on a visit of friendfhip, at Mr. Modely's ; bc
xno- ushered into the parlour, I found his oldest daughter, Miss
s a fly, fitting in one of the windows, with a very pensive counten
ance, hemming a ruffle : With a freedom, which is natural to me,
and being an old acquaintance, I enquired how all the family did.
"We are all very well, said Miss Sally, except my dear Mare.
Your Mare ! What ails her pray ? O Sir, said Sally, (he is very
jick, you would hardly know herâHie is so fallen awayâ(he is a
mere fkeleton â(he has loft her appetiteâcan eat scarcely any
thing, and if her complaints do not soon take a more favorable
turn I fear the word consequences may happen ; and what would
become of me, if I should lo(e her jnd here the poor girl
fobbed and cried sadly. I never was more surprised in my life,
than on this occasion ; for tho it is difficult to account for the
ftreugth of many incidental aitachments, even to cats 4 dogs or hor
ses; yet as I supposed from Mr. Mode l y's circumstances, and
bisaffe&ion to his dear girl, that if she (hould loÂ£e the pretty Nag/
which it feerns he had lately presented her, he would very readily
give her another, I was exceedingly puzzled at the<exeefsof her
griefâaccordingly I attempted to sooth and moderate her afflic
tion, by faying, that such a loss could be easily made upâthat ten
or a dozen guineas would buy just such another : She darted with
amazement, and exclaimed, fir, you astonish me ! What do you
mean ? Can all the gold in the universe purchase me so kind, so
affectionate a parent? Here I was, in my turn, equally surprized
and confoundedâParent, said Iâyou puzzle me Miss Sally, be
yond expreflion : was you not just now speaking of your Mart ?
No fir, said flie, of my Mamma : Wnat confufion of terms! re
plied I.âPray never lead me into such ? mistake again by using
â¢what I now suppose is a modern pronunciation ; the absurdity of
it muftbe very apparent, when I allure you, Miss Sally, that I ans
wered you in the simplicity of my heart :My young friend felt
very forcibly the impropriety ot facrificing utility to fafliionâ
and declared (lie would never fubjett herfelf to a funilar misap
prehension. I have since learut that Pare is the modern pronun
ciation for Pa : A very ludicrous scene occurred in consequence
of a mistake in the supposed meaning of this word ; but the abovt
may fuffice for the present.
PEREGRINE.
P. S. I was mentioning this incident to a friend âon which he obfer
vcd } that I did not underjiand French.
FROM THE GENERAL ADVERTISER,
Mr. Bache,
JJ you, think the following hint can be of any advantage to this country,
which I have adopted as my patria, / requejl you to insert it in your
paper.
THE uncommon drynefs of the season, will very likely cause a
scarcity of hay; I propose an expedient that has perfectly
succeeded in France, under the fame circumstance. As there is
time yet to make use of it, I offer it earnestly to the public.
As it is known that when about the middle of May, the drynels
of the spring has Hopped the growth of the grafles, the husband
man has reason to apprehend a scarcity of hay, and that it is un
certain how he will be able to feed his cattle during the winter,
I invite him to try the following experiment:
About the end of this month, oY the beginning of June, but
not later, to plough twicc a piece of ground in size proportiona
ble to his wants. He must then choose the Indian corn of the
smallest size, in order to sow it thick; and sow at the rate of three
bushels to three birfhels and an half upon an acre, and harrow the
ground even. Before he sows the grain, he must let it soak du
ring 24 hours in water, to hasten the germination, and to prevent
its being eaten by the birds. It requires no more trouble till the
mowing, which ought to be performed when the blossom begins
to come out of the capfula : The plant is then full of juice, and
its (talks and leaves are exceedingly succulent; if it was mown
later, it would lose this good quality. It ought to be dried as
quick as possible, and housed for fodder. The cattle will eat it
greedily; it may be given green, and proves a good substitute for
hay.
The ground may be ploughed immediately after this mowing,
and sown with any winter grain. As the forage stands very little
on the ground, it has not time to impoverish it, but enriches it ra
ther, by the immense quantity ot tender roots that are buried by
the ploughing. I am, Sir, &c.

After dinner, among other judicious and liberal toasts, the fol

is more than fuflicient to make good all the da

fuffered by the late fi;e in Dock Itreet.
In addition to the above, the Mayor has inform'd
the citizens that 178 dollars have been raised
by the Old American Company, at the theatre,
for the relief of those unfortunate people.
A correspondent observes that the opinions of the minority, both
in politics and religion, have in all ages been considered as Here
siesâand the fate of Heresy is very well known. It was the in
fluence of that wisdom which comes from above, that led the citi
zens of these States to the adoption of a Constitution, which guards
the minority from the tyranny of the majority, by dividing the
powers of government into three branches, and making each a
check on the other. Heresies are the growth of every climeâ
our ancestors were persecuted as Heretics in Europeâthe intoler
ant spirit of the age, produced this Wcftcrn Empireâand strange
to relate, what some consider as the Heresies of the National Aflem
bly of France, have been the cause of the emigration to the wilds
of America, of a considerable number of Frenchmen : From whence
it appears, that political and religious heresies may be produ&ive
of some advantages. About the year 1787, there were many po
litical Heresies rife in this countryâwhether the knowledge of
them reached France or not, is nothing to the purposeâcertain it
is, that some of our best citizens supposed we were at that time,
very near realizing the sailor's advice, * 4 to divide the world over
again : This was a very prevailing Heresy ; another was, that go
vernment was unnecessary, or at least, the expence of supporting it :
Taxes had been so long out of faftiion, that it was considered a mod
â¢ibominable imposition to levy them : Another prevailing Heresy
at that time, and perhaps not yet entirely extinct, was, that the
words public credit were entirely useless ; the creditors, it was said,
were in the power of the majority, and must abide their decision.
Other Heresies might be mentioned, but the above may fuffice.â
23
These Heretics, like the Heresies of old, were produÂ£live of quite
d.ffereut events from those expectedâand that form of govern
ment, which, so far as relpe&s our political state, has, in a man
ner, annihilated humau evil, was the bleffcd confcquence.
It has been said that the people of England have no constitution
â but what, according to fame fyltems of politics, are conftitu
paichment, which the people may at one period
'-onndrr as the palladium of their rights ; and at another period
annihilate as ufelcls, and worse than ufelcfs repofuories of ab
luraities.
The people of England have however high ideas of personal
(octal and political freedomâand these ideas are iufeparably conl
netted with certain great principles, which they wifely fuopofe
lorm the great outlines of a couftitution. This conflitution is
written on their heartsâit thore has an existence, an influence an
operation which are superior to eHeAs produced by penlhable
manuscripts or parchmcnt declarations. This conftjiution lihe
t ie immijtSble principles of common taw, approves itfelf to the
reason and conscience of every free born Englishmanâand hence
we find the natives of that eouniry, like the free citizens of the
United States, have a high sense of the superior rank they hold n
[he community ol mankind. If the English nation has no con
flitution, what volumes have been written by some very wife men
on a nonentity ! '

ft E P O ft T
OF THE
SECRETARY OF STATE,
On the fubjcÂ£t of the
COD AND WHALE FISHERIES,
THE rival fifhermen immediately endeavoured to turn this
measure to their own' advantage, by pouring their whale
oils into the markets of France, where they were enabled, by
the great premiums received from their governmeot, perhaps too
by extraordinary indemnifications, to undersell both the French
and American fifhermen. To repel this measure, France shut her
ports to all foreign fifh oils whatever, by the arret No. 10. The
British whale fiftiery fell, in confcquence, the ensuing year, from
two-hundred and twenty-two to one hundred and feveiuy-eight
ships. But this general exclusion had palsied our fishery alio.
On the seventh of December, 1788, therefore, by the arret No.
xi, the ports of France, still remaining (hut to all other nations,
"were again opened to the produce of the whale fifheries of the
United States ; continuing, however, their endeavours to recover
a ihare in this fi(hery themselves, by the aid of our fiftiermen.
In 1784 â5â6 âthey had had four ships ; in 1787, three ; in
X/ 88, seventeen :n the two fifheries, of tour thousand seven hun
dred ton. These cost them in bounty, two hundred and twentv
fivc thousand livresTwilich divided on one thousand five hundred
and fifty tons of oil, tWe quantity they took, amounted to one
hundred and forty-five livres (near twenty-seven dollars) the ton ;
and on about one hundred natives on board the seventeen ships,
for there were one hundred and fifty Americans engaged by the
voyage) came to two thousand two hundred and fifty livres, or
about four hundred and sixteen dollars and two-thirds a man.
We have had daring the years 1787 â8â9 âon an average,
ninety-one veflels, of five thoufÂ«ind eight hundred and twenty
tons, in the northern, and thirty-one, of four thousand three
hundred and ninctv-tons, in the southern fifhery. See No. 12.
The details will enable Congress to fee with what a competition
ye have to struggle for the continuance of this filhery, not to fay
its inrreafe. Against prohibitory duties in one country, and
bounties of the adventurers in both of tliofe which are contend
ing with each other for the fame object, ours have no auxiliaries
but poverty and rigorous economy. The bufintfs, unaided, is a
â wretched one. The Dutch have peculiar advantages for the nor
thern fifhery, as being within fix or eight days fail of the grounds,
as navigating with more economy than *ny other nation in Europe,'
their seamen content with lower wages, and their merchants with
lower profits. Yet the memorial of No. 13, from a committee
of the whale merchants to the States General of Holland in the
year 1775, state* that fourteen millions of guilders, equal to five
millions fix hundred thousand dollars, had been loft in that fifh
ery in forty-feven years, being about one hundred and twenty
thousand dollars a year, '1 he States General thereupon gave a
bounty or thirty guilders a man to the fifhermen. A person in
timately acquainted with the British whale fifhery, and whose
Jnlormation merits confidence, has given afTurance that the ships
employed in their northern filhery in 1788, funk eight hundred
pounds each on an average, more than the amount of the pro
duce and bounties. An English {hip of three hundred tons, and
forty.two seamen in this fifhery generally brings home, after a
lour months voyage, twenty-five ton of oil, worth four hundred
and thirty-seven pounds ten (hillings sterling ; but the wages of
the officers and seamen will be four hundred pounds, theie re
main but thirty-seven pounds ten shillings, not worth taking in
to account towards the outfit and merchants profit. Thefc then
must be paid by th? government; and it is on this idea that the
Eritifh bounty is calculatcd.
Our veflel for the northern fifhery average sixty-sour tons, and
cod when built, fitted ouf, and victualled for their firft voyage
about three thousand dollars. They have taken on an average The
three lafl years, according to the flatement No. 12, eighteen tons
of oil, worth, at our m3i ket, nine hundred dollars, which are to
pay all expenees, and subsist the fiihermen and merchant. Our
vessels for the fourhern fifhery average one hundred and forty tons,
and cost, when built, fitted out, and victualled for their firft
vc-yage, about fix thousand five hundred dollars. They have ta
ken on an average the three last years, according to the fame
statement, thirty-two tons ot oil, each worth at our market three
thousand two hundred dollars, which are, in like manner, to pjv
all expenees and subsist the owners and navigators. Thcfe expen
ees are great, as the voyages are generally of twelvemonths du
ration. No hope can arise of their condition being bettered bv
an augmentation of the price of oil. This is kept down by the
competition ot the vegetable oils, which answer the fame purpo
ses, not quite so well, but well enough to becomc preferable,
â were Ihe price to be raised, and so well indeed as to be moie'
generally used than the fifh oils for lighting houses and cities.
The A merican whale fifhery is principally followed by the in
habitants of the island of Nantucket, a sand bar of about fifteen
miles long and three broad, capable of maintaing bv its agricul
ture about twenty-families : but it employed in these fifhenes be
fore the war, between five and fix thousand men and boys; and
in the only harbour it pofTefles, it had one hundred and 'forty
veflels, one hundred and thirty-two of which were of the larger
kind, as being employed in the southern fifhery. In agriculture
then, theyhaÂ«.eno resource, and, if that of their fifhery cannot
be pursued from their own habitations, it is natural they should
seek others from which it can be followed, and preferably those
they will find a lameness of language, religion, laws, ha
bits and kindred. A foreign emiflary has lately been
them, for the purpose of renewing the invitations to a change oT
situation. But attached to their native country, they prefer con
tinuing in it, if their continuance in it can be made supportable.
This brings us to the question, what relief does the condition
of this fifhery require ?
lft. A remission of duties on the articles used f or their calling.
2d. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to seek a com
petition with them in or from our ports.
3d. Free markets abroad.
lft. The remiflion of duties will stand oa nearly the fame
ground with that to the cod fifhermen.
2d. The only nation whose oil is brought hither for competi
tion with our own, makes ours pay a duty of about eighty-two
dollars the ton, in their ports. Theirs is brought here too, to
be re-shipped fraudulently under our flag into ports where it
could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered
by ours, if we mean to preserve our own admission into them. The
3d. And principal object, is to find markets for the vent of oil.
Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, P r u{fia,
Rufiia, the Hanfe towns, supply themselves and something more.
Spain and Italy receive supplies from England, and need the
Icfs as their flues ai e clearer. France is the only country which
can take our surplus, and they take principally of the common
oil; as the habit is but commencing with them of ascribing a jufl
value to that of the (permacaeti whale. Some of this, however,
finds vent there. There was, indeed, a particular interest per
petually soliciting the cxclufion of our ofls from their maikets.
The late government there saw well, thai what we should lose
thereby, would be gained by others, not by themselves. And
â we are to hope that the present government, as wife and friendly,
will also view us, not as rivals, but asco-operators against a com
mon rival. Friendly arrangements with them, and accommo
dation to mutual interest, rendered easier by friendly dispositions
exiftingon both fides, may long secure to us this important re
source lor our seamen. Nor is it the ir.tereft at the fifherman
[continued.]
alone, which calls for the cultivation of f ri?ndly arrangements
with that nation. Besides five-eighths of our whale oil, and two
thirds of our salted fifh, thty take from us one-fourth of our to
bacco, three-fourths of our Jive flock (No. 14.) a considerable
and growing proportion ot our rice, great supplies occafionallv
of other grain ; in 1789, whith, indeed, was extraordinary foui
millions of buihels ot wheat, and upwards of a million of buQi
elsof rye and barley (No. 15.) and nearly the whole carried in
our own vessels (No. 16.) They are a free market now, and will
in a time be a valuable one for our (hips and ship-timber, potash
and peltry. [To be continued.]

ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lavs open to the found
but by realon of the fiats, this wharf is netefiarily extended to the
channel, where ships can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the most extenftve and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3-4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all dalles of people, for
the success of this enterprise, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there' being mor<
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet publilhed ir
Ameriea) induce the managers to believe the tiekets will meet with
a speedy sale. ,
The drawing will pofitive'.y commence at the State-House, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be publifbed, and the prizes
paid on demand, bv the managers. Those prizes notcalled for in
nine months after drawing, will, be deemed as generoufiy given
for the use of the wharf, and appropriated accordingly. **
