FROM A POEM, NOT YET PUBLISHED
HOLD, Atticus, 'till that grave Do&or pass ;
E'en meanness in her trade's a very ass,
Compar'd 10 himâimposing on mankind
His giavity tor partsâtor sense refin'd.
Say, is your friend, your father, brother, ill ?
Pr.iy trust not himâ-except you wish to kill:
If so, 'midst all the Quacks that crowd the town,
There is not one, for killing, better known.
Who Atticus when languidiing in bed
He saw his friend ? Who would not weep him dead,
Should this grave Owl be call'd to give the potion,
And launch him to eternity's wide ocean ?
liut to be candid-âall ill will apart;
Some lay the Doctor has a generous heart.
And friend, in truth, molt noble proof indeed '
I've heard, how he would Ireely purge, and bleed
A beggar, in the twinkling of a thought ;
And ask him, only all he hadâa groat.
Yet can I give another mark of merit,
And (hew his tenter, fympathizmg spirit.
Nan, lhameful fare ! was mighty ill, and poor ;
This man, with meafur'd ttep, pafs'd by her door ,
Straight was he cali'dâhe tuin'd his head about,
And lawâa creature with 9 tatter'd coat !
On Hill he ibtelv march'd ; the wretciied mat#,
Diftra&ed with the thought oi dying Nan,
Puifu'd ; o'ertook him, pray'd, intreated, cry'd â
But Jtubborn as a bull's, remain'd his prideâ
" Here Doctor, here's a dollar, will you come ?"
" Yes," said thegood man, smiling, " lhcw the room."
So back they went---" there 011 the floor," he cry'd,
There's Nan, poor thing !" and wrung his hands and figh'd.
The Do&or felt her pulse, and found herâdead;
Then mighty wifely shaking W\sfmall head,
Oblcrv'd, 44 the woman's very well, I find ;
" She's gone, and lelt this wicked world behind :
" So, fir, I thank you much tor what you've paid,
" Good-byeâyou'd belter get a coffin made."

MAGNETIC TIDES
SHOULD Congress defray the expence of a
voyage to the Magnetic point in Baffin's $ay,
who knows but a set of observations may be made
to explain, in some degree, the nature of this
â wonderful effect.
It seems to be proved by the principles of ge
ometry, that the magnetic needle has an univer
sal direction towards two magnetic points, and
that the magnetic points perform revolutions in
certain given times : it is also found by experi
ence, that many changes have taken place on the
furface of the earthâat one time and place the
sea makes rapid encroachments 011 the lands, at
at another time it defertsvery extensive dillritSs
âthese changes are found to take place accord
ing to the revolutions of the magnetic points ;
and as this the cafe; there is ten thousand to
one in favor of the fame cause having an influ
ence as well upon the waters of the ocean, as up
on the direction of the magnetic needle.
Many opinions of learned men, such as Bttffbri,
Goldsmith, llay, Raynal and others, tend to con
firm the truth of the observation, that the furface
of this globe is luhjeCt to perpetual change by
real'on of the rising and falling of the ocean,
which would seem to be governed by laws as cer
tain and uniform as the common tides.
Diodorus, Sic.uliis, Plato, Aristotle and others,
besides the Kgyptian l'riefls, describe a continent
as large as America to have exitted about twen
ty-five hundred years ago, many days fail west
ward from Europe and Africa ; this great coun
try, they fay, was afterwards covered with wa
terâSurely ttiefe lovers of truth would not pub
lish a fallliood. Many of the moderns think A
nierica answers the defci iption of the country ;j
yet the generality of hiltorians who treat of the
new world,, have pafled this account in silence.
It is certain there are large bodies of petrified
fea-lhells oil many mounrains of America, a proof
that it malt have continued many years under
the sea.
An inundation is well known to have buried
in modern times, with astonishing rapidity, the
half of Friezland ; it is said that something more
than sixty years ago, the church steeples of eight
teen villages near Mardike teftified the unhappy
event, they then appeared above the furface of
the sea, but have since yielded to the force of the
waves.

[Whole No. 292.]
The Baltic Sea lias destroyed and overwhelm
ed aiming many others, Uie famous port of Vi
neta ; and covered by flow degrees, a laioe por
tion of Pomerania, The German ocean gradu
ally encroaching on the ihores of Holland, over
whelmed the ruins of an ancient citadel of the
Romans, which had formerly lieen built on that
coalt, and which is now actually under water.
In the faine manner the sea washing the coast
of Norway, is well known to have' detached se
veral little islands from rhe main land ; and is
itill making daily depredations upon the conti
nent of Europe as well as Asia.
In some parts of the East-Indies, it is known
that the ocean in modern times lias encroached
four hundred leagues on the land, so as to cover
the low grounds and transform the tops of moun
tains into iiland.
Hence, after knowing the peiiodical revoluti
on of the two magnetic points, it is found they
cannot meet twice en the fame meridian under
(ivethoufand years; Â«n<l knowing the quantity of
acres ot. the furface of the globe, and the pro
portion between land and water, it is found there
is every year throughout the world about two
millions of acres covered with the sea in fotns
places, and about as much defened by it in others.
By the laws of nature and of nations, new
found lands are tiniverfally allowed to belong to
the Prince whose fubjeift makes the 'firft discove
ry ; as the author of the foregoing system is
a citizen of the United States, should the
addition of two millions of acres annually
on this account be claimed by this country, our
territories would soon become much more exten
sive than the largest empire in the world. X.
FROM A LATE HALIFAX PAPER.
WHENEVER a measure is proposed, which
affecls the interest of society, or even the
happiness of auy particular description of indi
viduals, who form a part of that society, an un
questionable claim results, from that relation in
which we stand to each other, as the offspringof
one Univerlal Parent, of pointing out those evils
and inconveniencies that may arise from the pro
secution of that measure, more especially, when
it immediately concerns those, who, from their
unfortunate situation, cannot have the means of
that information which is eUerifial to the form
ing a proper ellimaie of either their present or
future happiness. In fufch inftaitces humanity
will lend her aid, and the Chrittian then conli
ders himfelf of 110 country, but a citizen of the
world, and that the inhabitants of the remotelt
regions, as well as thole dwelling in the fame
diltrict with himfelf, are his neighbours and
countrymen, whenever their dillrelles demand
his friendly afliltance.
The attempts which are now making to in
duce the Blacks, who in general are'comfortably
fettled in this country, to remove ro the Coalt of
Guinea, led me into this train of reasoning ; and
( did hope some abler pen would have undertak
en the subject in behalf those unfortunate peo
ple, who, probably, will fall vitfims to the mis
taken principles of commerce, if not warned of
iheir danger, and the perilous iltuation to which
they will inevitably be exposed.
Of the policy arid justice of the measure, as ic
refpecfts this country, I shall nor, at present,
make any remarks further than to observe, that
it wears an unfriendly afpeit, as it will remove
from the Province a number of valuable settlers,
and therefore ought to be discountenanced, uti
le fs it was evident that thofc who are the imme
diate objects of it would be .placed in a happier
or more comfortable lituation.âBut of the pro
pofols offered by the Sierra Leone Company, I
will fay, they are too vague and indefinite aÂ»
the baiis of a Colonial ellablifliment, and howe
ver refpetflable the members of that Society may
be, either for their probity and humanity, it is a.
circnmftance of very serious cor.sequence (hac
the Blacks fliould be told, that the terms of set
tlementâthe time they will be victualled, .and.
the manner in which they are to be provided
with such neceflaries as are eflential to their ex
istence-âare neither ascertained nor pointed out
with that clearness and precision, which they
have an undoubted right to expetft ; without fay
ing any thing relpeiSing those other privileges
which, as members offociety, they havean equal
and common claim fully to participate in.âBe
sides, the country to which these devoted people
are to be fenc, notwithstanding the fertility ofits foil, and the variety of products it is capable
of affording, is of all others the molt to be dread
ed, for the conltant thunder, rain and ftifling
heat which prevails at least four months in the
year, produces such a corrupted air, that, in a
few hours all animal food is reduced to a state
of putrefatflion, and such of the wretched inha
bitants who survive owe their preservation to
confining themselves within doors, to avoid the
dreadful pestilential infection ofthe atmosphere.
The tornadoes in that part of Guinea are fright
ful and astonishing, for the most horrible dark
ness comes on at noon-day, and nature, in a mo
ment, puts on a dreadful, awful appearance,
which fills the minds with horror, and makes e
ven the brute creation to tremble.
About the year 1787, an attempt was made to
form a settlement at this very place, by fending
a number of Negroes from and about London.
The success of that enterprize and the melan
choly fate of the unfortunate advenurers, can
not be more correiftly stated than from the fol
lowing extra# from the proceedings of the ve
nerable society for propagating theGofpel in fo
reign parts, and with which 1 shall for the pre
sent conclude. PHILANTHROI'OS.

Thu RsDay, December 15.
"Whereas considerable expences have been incurred by this
commonwealth, since the adoption of the federal constitution, in
the necessary defence of the frontier* from the invasions and de
predations of the ravages: and whereas one ot the essential objefls
of the said constitution is to provide tor the common defence, in
order to promote which, this commonwealth has relinquiftied
many valuable sources of revenue :
Resolved, That the applicatiorvof the executive to the general
government for a reimbursement of the (aid expences, is not only
jult and proper, but discovers a laudable zeal for the interest of
the commonwealth, well deserving the approbation of the General
Aiiembly, and they are requested therefore to persevere in their
den>ands ; and to insist on a compliance with them.

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY, February 2, 1792.
Tht amendments of the Senate to the P oft-Office Bill
â¢were taken into consideration by the House.
of the amendments was to strike out Ex-
rterâ¢ from the general route of tlie port.
Mi. Gilman rose in opposition to this amend
ment-.
I hope, said he, the alteration will not be a
greed toâwhen this bill went up to the Senate,
a "r/l'- 1 ' ormeC ' Was comm i t ted to a committee
conlilting of a member from each stateâthat the
alterations were made in that committee, and af
terwards agreed to in Senate without much de
bate. In that committee this fubjert was very
\J 1 al '' gentlemen who were
then in favor of the amendment, are now on fur
ther enquiry, decidedly againfl it. This I think
a good reason why the House ought not to con
cur. But, fir, I beg leave to offer some reasons
why an office should be established in Exeter-
It is a compact town of considerable trade and
ome navigationâit has a direst trade with Bos
ton, and vends considerable quantities of dry
goodsâthis trade would be greatiy facilitated
by haying the stage pass through the town But
what is of more importance and more extensive
in its operation, arises from the neceflary com
munication which is kept up between that town
and other parts of the (lateâthis will be perfert-
Iv understood, when gentlemen are informed
that the records of the state, the secretaries and
treasury offices are kept thereâthat the records
and treasury of a large county, comprehending
both Portsmouth and Exeter, and extending fifty
or sixty miles into the country are also kept there
âand that the judicial courts of the county, the
state and the United States, set there at appoint
ed periodsâlf is there the governor convenes
his council to consult on public affairsâand it is
from that place a communication should be kept
up between the state and the general govern
mentâfrom these circumstances it appears that
it would be very convenient not only for Exeter,
but for a considerable part of the state to have an
office established there ; and as the neceflary
communication between that and other towns
would afford frequent opportunities to fend and
receive letters by private conveyance, a doubt
can hardly exist that such an arrangement would
be productive to the revenueâthis 1 believe to
be the opinion of the post-master general. Sir,
the distance from Bolton to Portsmouth does not
exceed seventy miles, and that perhaps the best
. road within the United States of equal extentâ
the objection therefore that the stage cannot pass
through in a day, can have no weight, it is too
absurd to deserve a serious refutationâthe differ
ence in the diltance between the present route
of the mail, and the one proposed through Exe
ter is, pasting through Kensington, about three
miles, or by Hampton-Falls, about five miles
the road through Kensington is a good carriage
road, the stage ran that way about five years ago,
before the proprietors contracted for the trans
portation of the mailâit was then a pretty good
road, since which it is much improvedâit was
therefore a falfe aflertion to fay that the road
through Kensington or Hampton-Falls is badâ
and 1 am persuaded that the mail passing that
way could not be injurious to Portsmouth. But,
fir, the opposition to this measure arises from a
rivalfhip between the twotownsâBefore the war,
the courts and offices jufl now mentioned, were
held exclusively at Portsmouthâon the com
mencement of hostilities it was found conveni
ent to temove them to Exeter, where it has been
thought expedient to continue themâbut this
has excited a degree of jealousy in the minds of
some persons, in the interest of Portsmouth, who
are perpetually on the watch to oppose any pub
lic measure calculated to promote the interest or
convenience of Exeterâlf this alteration takes
place, letters going to Exeter will be liable to a
portage of 20 or 25 per cent more than by the
present arrangement, and as the cross-post will
set off but once a week, letters may lie fix or se
ven days in the office at Portsmouthâthis will
preclude the people of Exeter from the benefit
of a port, and they will be obliged to fend their
letters by private conveyance as they now do.
By the original conftrucftiou of the bill, the ex
pence of transporting the mail would belefs than
by the proposed alteration, as by extending the
route of the principal mail about three miles fur
ther, the travel of the cross-post is shortened 14.
I therefore hope the people in that part of the
state will not be deprived of rights naturally aris
ing from their situation, by the prejudice and
misrepresentation of those who wish to injure
them, and that the amendment will not be-aereed
to.
Mr. Livermoreâl {hall agree to the amend
ment made by the Senate in this bill, to strike
out Exeter, and to carry the mail by the accus
tomed route, through Hampton, which is the
nearelt way, ;is gentlemen have heretofore dat
ed, by about five miles ; and it is also the bed
road, more especially in winter, when the snow
is deep, being a road more used, and consequent
ly the paths better kept open. And as the bill
provides that a mail (hall be carried from Ports
mouth by Exeter, to the interior parts of the
state, 1 think the town of Exeter will be well ac
commodated, without the deviation of five miles
betoie mentioned. As the flage carriages that
carry the mail three times a week, between Ports
mouth and Bolton, in the summer season, carry
many pafl'engers from Portfmonth and from Bos
ton, and other places, a deviation of five miles,
and in a worse road, would be a very great in
convenience to such paflengers. The distance
from Boston to Portsmouth, by the usual route,
is about 6; miles. This is a pretty long journey
to be performed with a stage waggon in one day,
which is the cafe in the summer season ; but five
miles added, may induce the neceflity of travel
ing sometimes after night, which would be at
tended with inconveniency to the paflengers,
beiid.es hindering the mail from arriving at the
appointed hour. The inconvenience would also
perhaps be greater in winter, in proportion to
the number of paflengers, and in refpett to re
tarding the mail, as some part of the new pro-
Pi, route is confiderablv more liable to be
blocked up with snow, for'want of travelling to
keep it open, than the old route.
Portsmouth being a place of considerable com
merce and navigation, it is important that the
mail mould arrive at its proper times, and as ear
ly as potfible. The letters for Exeter are few,
compared with the number for Portfniourh. The
post-master bas ftafed the amount of the poftao-e
of letters for Exeter, pafling through his office at
334
l ortfinoutli, to be about fifteen dollars and
half, in eleven months from the firft of Tanuarv
179' ; a *U'Â» v ery inconsiderable indee<fcompar
ed to the amount of portage received for let-en
delivered in Portsmouth during the f ame period.
Mr. Thatcher : I feel myfelf, f lr , as !itde ;
t ere (ted in the present queition as it is possible
far the gentleman just now up, from New-Hamn
fhne (Mr. Livermore) Indeed I have no other
inrereft in this matter than what arises from a
desire to accommodate the greatelt number of
peopleâand so far I confefs I feel interested â¢
for any general measure that does not efFedi
this gives a certain degree of pain. If the fails
that have been stated be true, and the ar 2u
ments drawn from them in support of the a.
mendment, be conclusive, I certainly should be
interested in favor of it ; because it must imme
diately affect my constituents.â But, fir, the
facfts are not true, nor the reasoning just.' Sir
the real matter in. dispute between Portsmouth
and Exeter, has not yet been understoodâ and I
ctkiceive it to be simply this : shall the mail from
Boston arrive at Exeter about two hours earlier
on the fame day, than at Portsmouth ; or shall
it arrive at Portsmouth firft, and to Exeter the
next day, or within fix or seven days after'
This, fir, is the real queftionâfor whetherit
partes through Exeter, or through Hampton as
it now does, it will reach Portsmouth on the
fame day it leaves Boston, and about the fame
hour, if the hour of arrival at Portsmouth be
fixed at eight o'clock in the summer time, the
post may accomplish the route through Exeter
with easeâand lie will do no more if he pafles
through Hampton : this brings us t6 an exami
nation of the reasons offered in favor of the
amendment, which go altogether to shew that if
the route be established through Exeter,the mail
will not arrive at Portsmouth on the fame day
it leaves Bostonâand consequently the mer
chants at that place will be injuredâand not on
ly so, but 'tis said, the Portland mail will be de
layed another day. Did I believe, iir, tberewaj
the least shadow of reason for this apprehension,
I should be the firft for agreeing to the amend,
ment ; but, fir, 'tis all a pretence, a whim in
vented for no other reason, than to prevent the
mail's arriving at Exeter before it does at Ports
mouth.
The gentleman (Mr. Livermore) has said the
route from Boston to Portsmouth through Exeter,
is about five miles farther, than through Hamp
ton â he does not pretend to fay it is more ; I
verily believe the difference is rot more than
three milesâif it is so much as that ; but for
the fake of the argument I will admit there it
the difference contended for by the gentleman ;
we will examine the question on that fuppoli
tion, and fee if there arises a probability that
the increased distance will prevent the arrival
ofthemailat Portsmouth on the day it leaves
Boston. It seems to be agreed that the old route
from Boston to Portsmouth is about sixty four or
five miles ; now 'tis a facft, fir, that prior to the
building the bridges across Mystic and Beverly
rivers the stage palled this route in a dayâal
though at Beverly Ferry it was detained from
thirty to forty minutes where it now partes in
two, and,it was obliged to go round by tbe
town of Mysticâwhich is two miles farther than
where it now crofles on the bridge ; by these
bridges then we may consider five miles taken
off the whole distanceâso that admitting the ob
jection of the addition of five miles, as the gen
tleman wifhestohave it, the mail may now pass,
in a day, from Boston to Portsmouth through
Exeter, with the fame ease and certainty that ic
did before the erection of these bridges, through
Hampton Fallsâthe route contemplated by the
amendment ; and I must ,beg leave further to
observe, that a bridge is about to be thrown
across Merrimack River, which will considerably
add to the facility of parting ; and may well be
counted upon as a further deduction of the dif-
ance
It has been said by the gentleman from New-
Hampshire (Mr. Livermore) that the road from
Portsmouth to Newbury-Port is a good road ; I
agree with him in this point ; I am as perfectly
acquainted with the road from Portfmouih to
Newbury-Port as he can beâl know every patch
of sand, or rock in the way, that can
carriage ; but as good as it is, I presume he will
acknowledge there is more sandy heavy rpad for
wheel carriages, in this part of the line than all
the reft of the way to Boston ; so that fon-ething
oughtto be carried to the credit of the Exeter
route becatife it avoids this sand. 'Tis said the
road through Kensington to Exeter, is blocked
up with snow in the winter timeâgranted as to
some particular seasons ; but the fame is also the
cal'e as to Hampton road ; 1 have often knov*w
the Hampton road so blocked up that the ft32e
could not run for several weeks , this was rhe
cafe last March, and I was then informed that
the road through Kensington and Exeter waÂ»
paflable for the ltage earlier than the Hamp'c n >
and here to be noted thete is a cm' 1 ' 3 ?
near-half a mile in length in Hampton, o*er
which the passing is not only difficult in the * in "ter time, but very dangerous if paflaule at ail,
as some tides flow it two feet and more ; I pall
ed it last March in this situation : This incon
venience however will be avoided by palling
through Exeterâand no part ot that route is lo
bad in the winter time as this caufway ; 1 have
heretofore travelled in the winter time through
XenfinÂ«non and Exeter on being advil'ed ic was
the belt road of the two ; and tliough there was
much snow on the ground we found no anlicul
ty in getting alongâHence, fir, 'tis evident to
me that the mail may easily be carried from iiol
ton, through Exeter to Fortfmouth 111 a day â
and that the objetfion founded on the increale
of distance is a mere pretence, originating m an
tinwillingnefs, in the minds ot some people, iliac
the mail flyiuld arrive an hour or two looner at
Exeter than Portsmouth. . .
The gentleman (Mr. Livermore) has laid it is
a principle of the bill, that the mail shall be
carried in the molt direct road from place to
place, and that it will be a deviation from this
principle to go through Exeter: 1 his, lir, is
not ftridtly trueâno such principle has been ad
hered to but in a qualified sense ; and it has
been departed from whenever it would accom
date any considerable number of people. 1 willi
here to remind the Houle of Springfield in Mas
sachusettsâand Middleton, in Connecticut ; in
the former inllance the direct route from Wor
celter to Hartford is not through Springfield ;
but a deviation of near ten miles is made to ac
commodate that town : and in palling from Hart
ford to New-Haven a deviation ot tour or five
miles (if I am mistaken, gentlemen from that
State will corredt me) is made for the purpole
of accommodatingthe town of Middletown ; ma
ny other instances of this nature might be ad
ducedâand why lliall not a small deviation be
now made in favor of Exeter, especially since no
inconvenience will result therefrom to Ports
mouth ! 1 can fee no real'on.
In order to convince ihis House that the mail,
an paffiug from Boston to Portsmouth, ought not
to be carried through "Exeter, the gentleman has
read a Jetter frem the Polt-Mafter at Portsmouth,
slating the number of letters that pass in a year,
by a cross pott, to Exeter ; by
which it appears the number indeed is very small.
Hence he would draw an argument that the bu
siness between Boston and Exeter is trifling, and
not of confeqnence enough to juftify so small a
deviation in the mail line of three or fourâor,
as the gentleman contends, of five miles. But,
Mr. Speaker, this is strange logic ! and a very
different conclusion results in my mind from the
contents of the letter. The letter may be evi
'dence how little business is carried on between
Portsmouth and Exeter, and that consequently
there is no reail need of a port between thefetwo
placesâbut it does not contain she shadow of
evidence that there is no commercial business be
tween Boston and other places in Maflachufetts
and Exeter. If a gentleman in those places wish
ed to write to Exeter, he would never think of
putting his letter into the Portsmouth mailâhe
inuft know that ii is liable to lay fix days in the
poft-ofKce at Portsmouth, and perhaps longerâ
while various opportunities, by a private con
veyance, would pjrefent within that time.
I have hitherti? admitted the additional dis
tance, by going through Exeter, to be five miles
âbÂ«t, fir, fitice the\jnail ttage pafles Merrimack
river, about four miles above the old ferry (the
gentlemen of the house acquainted with that part
of the country know the places I refer to) I can
not agree that this additional dittance will be
more than three miles, if so much. But, howe
ver this may be, I trust I have (hewn to thefatif
fa<flion of the house, that whether it be five or
three, it cannot produce any inconvenience to
Portfmoi)th,but mast be highly beneficial toExeter.
There is another consideration, fir, thai ought
to have forne weight in deciding this question â
which I will mention, & fay no moreâit is this :
A letter that goes from Boston to Exeter, thro'
Portsmouth, will ttand charged twenty-five per
cent, more than if the mail was carried diredlly
from Boston to Exeterâwhile, on the other hand,
the postage of a letter from Boston to Poftfmouth
is the fame, whether the mail pafsthrough Hamp
ton or Exeterâbecause, in both of thele routes,
the distance from Bofton'to Portsmouth is more
than sixty miles, and Ihort of the next grade of
postage. For these reasons, fir, 1 hope the house
will disagree to the amendment.
Mr. Smith (N.H.) observed, that he was sorry
to find his colleagues differing in opinion on the
Jubjeft under consideration. He had no preju
dice in favor of one of the towns (Portsmouth &
Exeter) above the other.âHe only wished the
bill might, establish that route which would best
.accommodate the ttate at large. He conceited,
when the fituatiori of New-Hampshire was consi
dered, it would be evident that the bill as pa (Ted
by the House, was better calculated to answer
this purpose, than it would in cafe the amend
ment proposed by the Senate (hould be; adopted.
He remarked that the trade of the greater part
of that state had been, and probably-would con
tinue to be with Boftonâthit if the general line
of the post-road fliould be eftabliflicd through
Exeter, it would be to the people in the interior
part of New - Hampshire, a saving of at least 25
miles in the dillance between them and Boltonâ
that the trade of Exeter, though within ij miles
ot Portsmouth, was principally with Boltonâthat
it the amendment proposed by the Senate fliould
lie adopted, they would be deprived of any be
nefit from the eltablifhment of post-roadsâthat
the route would be so circuitous, that the people
in the interior parts of the state would probably
in future, as they hnd in times past, fend their
letters to Bolton, and to the fotnliward, by pri
vate conveyance, rather than by post ft was
easy to fee that the revenue by this means would
be injuredâthat this circumstance would serve
to account for the Itatement read from the polt
mafler at Portsmouth, of the frnall number of
letters sent from his office to Exeter. It was his
opinion that the revenue would be oreatly in
cieafed, by taking Exeter into the main pott
road ; and that a contract for carrying the mail
from Portsmouth to Boston, might in that cafe
be obtained for as fin all a sum as by the road now
usedâHe could not fee how this would injure
Portsmouth, though it might not prove advanta
geous 10 the poft-malter at that placeâHow far
the House might think it their duty to consult
the particular interest of that officer, he would
not pretend to fay. He had reason to believe
(though he could not speak altogether from his
own knowledge) that the account given of the
road by one of his colleagues and the gentleman
from MaHachufetts, was a jnft one. â Upon the
whole, considering the amendment as not calcu
lated to promote the advantage of the Hate he
had the honor to represent, he fliould vote a
gainst it.
MONDAY, February 13.
Mr. S. Bourne, from the committee on enrolled bills, informed
the Speaker, that the committee, on Friday last, wailed on the
President of the United States, and presented to him, for his appro
bation, the bill to eftabhfh the poll-office and post-roads within
the United States.
A committee was appointed, pursuant to Mr. Sterret's motion,
to bring in a bill to continue in force an ast declaring the assent

Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations.
The House relumed the consideration of the hill relative to the
election of a President and Vice-President of the United States,
and declaring the officer who (hall ast as President in cafe of va
cancies in the riffices both of President and Vice-Prefident.
After some debate, on a motion made to amend the bill, by the
addition of a clause to confine the number of electors to the num
ber of Senators and Representatives in Congress at the time such
electors shall be chosenâthe bill, together with the proposed
amendment, was ordered to be recommitted to a committee of
the whole House, and made the order of the day for to-morrow.
The House then resolved itfelf into a committee of the whole on
tbe representation billâMr. W. Smith in the chair.
The ratio of representation was fixed at thirty thousand by the
committeeâYeas 30, Nays2t.
A motion made by Mr. Mercer, to fubdifute the fird day
O&ober, 1792, indead of the 4th day of March, 1793, as the pe
'riod after which the representation is to be increnfed, gave 1 rfe to

cnair.
The motion for inferring a clause to redriÂ£t the number of the
electors to the number of the present Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, was negatived.
Mr. Sturges observed that he supposed the clause had been re
jr&ed on account of its being indefinite and complexâ-he there
fore renewed the motion in a more funple form. This motion,
after some debate, was negatived.
Mr. Gerry then moved a clause which provides that the num
ber of ele&ors shall be equal to the number of Senators and Re
prefentalivcs the dates shall by law be entitled to at the time the
President and Vice-Pielident shall enter on their refpe&ive offices.
A proviso was added,.by which the exiding numbers of Congress
shall regulate the number of the electors, in cafe thÂ£ apportion
ment of Representatives shall not nave been compleated agreeable
to a preceding ennmeration. Tim amendment, with the pro
viso, was, after further debate, agreed to.
The committee then rose and reported this amendment to the
Houseâthe House took the fame ; the question being divided,
the firft part was carried in the affirmativeâayes 29 ânoes 21.
The proviso was then put and agreed to-âand the bill ordered
to be read the third time to-morrow.

FOR THE GAZETI E OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT seems to be as easy to form a recipe to write a good flinging
piece against the government, as \o make a pudding. Minis
terial puffers, the pomp and parade of government, court syco
phants, parasites, worshippers of power, See. are all prodigiously
smart sayings. Like common swearing, they give a life and bold
ness to writing, Which raise it a mile above the sneaking vulgar
(tyle. You may be sure the writer of a piecc abounding with
those excellencies, wears a cocked hat, and impolesfilence and re
fpeft in every company, which has the happiness to oemadewiler
bv his wisdom. It is really an happy thing to fee these lafhiona
ble phrases brought over sea to relifti our insipid politics: they
have long needed spicing. A formal fellow, who is in the old
homefpuu way, after reading a smart piece in the newspaper, told
me he did not know what the foohfti fellow (there he meant me,
for I wrote the piece) could mean by those huffifh, outlandish
terms of abuse on the government. Why, said he, and was there
ever such a fool betore, do we not make the government
and unmake it at our pleasure ? The public governs the Congiefs.
The considerate, and very often the mconfiderate opinion of the
public, is obeyed.âHe was going on in this strainâbut I thought
he talked so queer ly, that I left him abruptly. Z.

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS,
The conftitutfon of the state of Mafiachufetts, has made it ex
pressly the duty of the legislature to patronize and encourage the
UniverHtv at Cambridge. Such a fait will aflift future historians
in wr ting the history of this age. It is owing to the annual grants
of money by the legislature of that Hate, that the University ot
Cambridge has grown up tofuch celcbiity. That state will demht
lefs pursue the policy which the wife example of their forefathers
and their constitution have made so refpeftableâand by continiir
ing their public affiflance in money, extend the fame and ufeful
nefs of that ancient leminarv of learning. It is to be hopeo that
every state will turn its attention to this important object. It is
much to the honor of the state of North-Carolina, that they have
applied five thousand pounds to the cftablifhmcnt of a Univcrfity.
These instances do honor to our country, in our eyes and in thole
of foreign nations ; and they tend, by spreading igeneral know
ledge, to give the greatest degree of security to our liberties.
In this country, time and prosperity travel together. Without
being a prophet, with pen and ink a man may compute with to-*
lerable certainty, the grade of our advancement at any future pe
riod. There is some danger in this very fecuiityâWe talk of our
happiness as a nation, as of a property which we hold by deedâ.
a blefling which misfortune cannot interrupt, nor our toolifhjea
loufies and rivalfhips spoil after we have got itâBut we run one
hazardâbreaking the UnionâHeaven defend us.âThe idea aU
molt flops the pulse of the heart. But as common danger makes
friendfhips, fecuntv breaks them. In the American Dictionary
disunion (lands for every word of evil importâlt becomes every
good American to cultivate national fentinients, and to support
with all his powers a free federal government, which if it lads,
will make us the happied, and if it falls the most degraded wretch
ed people in the universe.
In consequence of the funding fydem, the southern dates expe
rienced a general refurre6lion of the credit of their paper se
curities; but conceiving that the circumstance was merely the
temporary inflation of a balloon, as soon as it appeared to rife,
those dates feaiing that it would fall again, cut the firings, and lep
it ascend-âHence we may account for two millions of dollars, ac r
cording to the calculation of a learned gentleman, having found
a stationary point in a higher latiiude.
For 'tis an old and juJI opinion,
Good.paper from the Svuth dominion ;
Like eagles when full jledg'd tuillJly t
And perch beneath a northern Jky.
How often, and how solemnly, is Congress warned againften*
croaching on the state governmentsâthese warnings and admoni
tions are heard from the legislators both of the general and date
governments-âthey are presented on every occasion, " line upon
line, and precept upon precept," in doors and out. Yea, it has
been said, " better difTolve the union than encroach on the state
governments"âVery well ; but let us now advert to the other
fide of the exhibitionâhere we find no apprehensions, dangers or
terrors, are entertainedâalthough the odds againdthe general go
vernment are as 14 to Iâand the indances of dates attempting to
legislate for the union, are flagrant and numerous.

OKI and New Testaments of his Royal Quarto Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE. The Apocrypha and Index, See. will be

Such Gentlemen as hold Subsc ri ft ion Par**s, he beÂ£ s W1

by the laflday of November next, and as much sooner as they coo

He is happy to inform the public, that the work has been ex l *
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and 3S
with their highest approbation; both as to the execution of t
printing, its corre&nels, and its cheapnels compared with Â£"o"
copies ol the lame size and quality.
As this very laborious and exceedingly expensive
