Discourses on DavilaâNo. 29.
( Concluded.)
THE affairs of the Hugonots were in a criti
cal situation. It was not doubted but that,
after the death of the Prince, the Admiral would
be chosen for their Chief, both because of the
distinguished employments which he had held in
the party, and the reputation which his prudence
had acquired. After the battle of Dreux, when
the Prince was made prisoner, the whole [party,
with unanimous consent, had deferred to Coligni
the honour of the command. But at present
there were several gentlemen, who, by their
birth, their riches, or their other qualities,
thought themselves not his inferiors. Some of j
these tore his reputation withflanders ; some de- j
tested the austerity of his character, mariners and
habits. Unhappy Admiral ! thy fortune however
is not Angular. Merit, talents, virtues, services,
of the most exalted kinds, have in all ages been
forced to give way, not to family pride, for this
alone would be impotent and ridiculous, but to
the popular prejudice, the vulgar idolatry, or
the splendor of wealth and birth, with which fa
mily pride is always fortified, supported and de
fended. The Admiral had 1011, by malignant
ferers, his brother Dandelot and his friend Bou
card: deprived of these two, the party which in
terested itfelf in the grandeur and elevation of
the Admiral, was considerably weakened. But
Coligni surmounted all obftaclesby hisaddrefsâ
he began by renouncing in appearance those chi
merical titles with which a vain ambition would
have been fatisfied, proposing however, in fac r t,
to preserve all the authority of the command.
He resolved to declare Chiefs of the party and
Generals of the army, Henry Prince of Navarre,
and Henry Prince of Conde, lon of the deceÂ»led
Prince. During the childhood of these, the Ad
miral remained neceflarily charged with the con
duct and administration of all affairs of import
ance. It was, among Protestants, as well as Ca
tholics, in the cause of liberty as well as that of
tyranny, the only means of reprefling the ambi
tion and pretensions, the envy, jealousy, malig
nity and perfidy of the grandees ; the only means
of answering the expectations of the people, and
of uniting minds which the diversity of sentiment
had already very much divided.
In this resolution, without demanding what he
felt, he could not obtainâThe Admiral intreat
ed the Queen of Navarre to come to the army,
reprcfenting to her that the moment was arrived
for elevating the Prince her son to that degree
of grandeur for which he was born, and to which
she had long aspired. The Queen was not want
ing in courage or fortitude : already resolved at
all hazards to declare her son the head of the
party, flie came with all the diligence which a
stroke of so much importance required, and ap
peared with the two Princes at the camp at Cog
nac. Discord reigned in the army, notwithstand
ing the neceflity of union and unanimity, tofuch
a degree that it was on the point of disbanding.
The Queen of Navarre, after having approved
the views of the Admiral, aflembled the troops ;
she spoke to them with a firmnefs above her sex,
and exhorted all those brave warriors to conti
nue constant and united, for the defence of their
liberty and their religion. Sliepropofed to them
for Chiefs the two young Princes, who were pre
sent, and whose noble air interested the fpei'la
tors ; adding, that, under the auspices of these
two young shoots from the royal blood, they
ought to hope for the most happy success to the
just pretensions of the common cause. Thisdif
courfe animated the courage of the army, who
appeared no forget in an instant the chagrine
caused by the loss of the battle, and by the dif
fentions which had followed it. she Admiral
and the Earl of Rocliefoucault were the fir It to
submit, and to take an oath of fidelity to the
Princes of Bourbon ; the nobility and all the offi
cers did the fame, and the foldievs, with great
acclamations, applauded the choice which their
Generals had made of the Princes for Chiefs and
protelhrs of the reformed religion. This inhuman
imaginations is considered, and in human lan
guage is called, Dignity ! The greatelt States
man, and the greatest General of his age, must
resign the command of his own army, even in the
cause of religion, virtue and liberty, to two beard
less boys, because they had more wealth, and
better blood.
Henry of Bourbon, Prince of Navarre, ?ged
I S, had however a lively spirit, a great and ge
Wednesday, April 15, 1791-
nerous foul, and difcoveved a decided inclination
for war : animated by the councils of his mother,
he accepted without hesitation the command of
the army, and proinifed the Hugonots, in a con
cise military eloquence, to protect their religion,
and to persevere in the common cause, until death
or victory Ihould procure them liberty. The
Prince of Conde, whose tender age permitted not
to express his sentiments, marked his consent
only by his gestures. Thus the Prince of Na
varre, who joined to the superiority of age the
prerogative of firft Prince of the Blood, became
really the head of the party. In memory of this
event, the Queen Jane caused medals of gold to
be (truck, which represented on one fide her
own bust, on the other that of her son, with this
inferiptionâPax certa, victoria Integra,
mors ho nest aâA faj'e peace, compleat viflory, or
honorable death.
Coligni remains charged with the conduct of
the war, by reason of the youth of the Princesâ
he divides his troops, and throws them into the
cities which adhered to him. Ihe Duke of.An
jou pursues his victory, and forms the siege of
Cognac, which he is obliged however to rail'e, by
the vigorous resistance of the besieged : he takes
several other cities. A new army of Germans,
commanded by the Duke of Deux Ponts, enters
France to aflift the Hugonots. Wolfang of Ba
varia, Duke of Deux Ponts, excited by the money
and the promiies of the Hugonots, with the aid
of the Duke of Saxony and the Count Palatine of
the Rhine, at the solicitation of the Queen of
England, had raised an army of 6000 infantry,
and 8000 horse. In the fame army was William
of Naflau, Prince of Orange, and Louis and
Henry his brothers, who, after having quitted
Flanders, to avoid the cruelty of the Duke of
Alva, supported the interests of the Calvinifts of
France, whose religion they profefled. Thisar
my marches towards the Loire, takes LaChaiite,
and pafles the river. The Duke of Deux Ponts
dies of a fever, and is succeeded in command by
Count Mansfeld. The Princes, and their Mentor
the Admiral, march to meet this succour. The
Duke of Anjou, for fear of being surrounded by
thele two armies, retires into Liuioufin, The
Hugonots, combined with their allies, follow the
royal armv. A spirited at Roche-Abeille.
The fterifity of the country forces the Hugonots
to retire. Ihe Queen Mother comes to the camp.
The resolution is taken to feperate the royal ar
my, to leave the forces of the Hugonots to con
sume by time : it is separated, in facft, and the
Duke of Anjou retires to Roches in Touraine.
CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SATURDAY, Feb. 7.
The BANK BILL under conjideration,
MR. GERRY's Speech concluded.
THE third rule of the Judge relative to the
" fubieift matter" of a law, it is unneceflary
to apply, because the members agree in then
ideas relative to the meaning of the terms taxes,
duties, loans, &c.
The fourth rule which relates " to effects and
confluences" is important ; and here the learned
Tud<re observes that" as to effedls and confe
rences, the rule is where the words bear none,
or a very absurd fignification if literally under
stood we must a little deviate from the received
fenfeof them." I" the present cafe the gentle
men in the oppofitioii generally, as well as the
gentleman firft up from Virginia, give the whole
clause by which Congress are authorized to
make all laws neceflary and proper, &c no
meaning whatever ; for they fay the former Con- |
cress had the fame power under the confedera
don without this clause as the present Congress
have with it. The federahft is quoted on this
occasion, but although the author of n
ed great ingenuity, this part of his performance
I co S âfider as a political heresy His dodtr.ne in
deed", was calculated to lull the confcicnce. o.
those who differed in opinion with lum at tnat
time, and havii'g acconiphflied his object, he.

[Whole No. 204.]
probably desirous that it may die with the oppo
sition itfelf. The rule in this cafe fays, that
where the words bear no fignification we must de
viate a little, and as this deviation cannot be
made by giving the words less than 110 meaning,
it mult be made by a more liberal conitrnctiou
than is given by gentlemen in the opposition.
Thus their artillery is turned on thenifelves, for
their own interpretation is an argument againlt
itfelf.
The last rule mentioned relates to the spirit
and reason of the law, and the Judge is of opin
ion " that the most universal and effectual wny
of discovering the true meaning of a law when
the words are dubious,is by considering the rea
son and spirit of it, or the cause which moved the
legislature to enaift it." The causes which pro
duced the conftiiution were an iniperfe<ft union,
want of public and private j lift ice, internal com
motions, a defencelefs community, neglect of the
public welfare and danger to our liberties.â
These are known to be the causes not only by
the preamble of the constitution, but also from
our own knowledge ol the history of the times
that preceded the eftabliflnnent of it If these
weighty causes produced the constitution, and it
not only gives power for removing them, but al
so authorizes Congress to make all laws liecefiary
and proper for carrying these powers into effedt:
shall we listen to assertions that these words have
no meaning and that this constitution has 110 c
more energy than the old ? Shall we thus un
nerve the government, leave the union, as it was
under the confederation, defencelefs against a
banditti of Creek Indians, and thus relinquifii
the protection of its citizens ? Or fliall we, by a
candid and liberal confirmation of the powers ex
prefTed in the constitution, promote the great
and important objects thereof? Each member
mult determine for liimfelf ; I fliall without he
sitation cliufe the latter and leave the people and
States to determine whether or not I am pursuing
their true intereft.âlf it is enquired where we
are to draw the line of a liberal coriftrucftion, I
would also enquire, where the line of restriction
is to be drawn ? The interpretation of the con
stitution, like the prerogative of a sovereign,
may be abused ; but from hence the disuse of
either cannot be inferred. In the exercise of
prerogative the minister is- refponlible for his ad
vice to his sovereign, and the members of either
House are responsible to their constituents for
their conduct in construing the constitution. We
a<-t at our peril : if our conduct is directed to the
attainment of the great objects of government,
it will be approved and not otherwise ; but this
cannot operate as a reason to prevent our dis
charging the trusts reposed in us.
Let us now compare the different modes of
reasoning on this fubjed:, and determine which
is right, for both cannot be.
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madiftm)
has urged the dangerous tendency of a liberal
confirmation ; but which is most dangerous a
liberal or a deftruÃhe interpretation ?âThe li
berty we have taken in interpreting the constitu
tion, weconceive to be afceffary, and it cannot be
denied to be u/eful in attainingthe objects of it:
but whilst he denies us this liberty he grants to
himfelf a right to annul part, and a very impor
tant part of the constitution. The fame princi
ple that will authorise a deftrudtioti of part will
authorise the deftrutfion of the whole of the con
stitution, and if gentlemen havea right to make
such rules, they bave an equal right to make
others for enlarging the powers of the coimitu
tion, and indeed of forming a defpotifin. Thus,
if we take the gentleman for our pilot, we fha'.l
be wrecked on the reef which he cantions us to
avoid. iin..
The gentleman has referred us to the ialt ai
ticle of the amendment proposed to the constitu
tion by Congress, which provides, that the pow
ers not delegated to Congress or prohibited to
the states shall reft in them or the people: And
the qneftion is; what powers are delegated?â
'l)oes the gentleman conceive that such only are
delegated as are exfirejfed? If so, hemull admit,
that'our whole code of laws is unconlhtutional.
This he disavows and yields to the iieceHity oi
interpretation, which, by a fair and candid ap
plication of established rules of conftrurtion to
the constitution, authorizes, as has been fliewn,
the meafurc under consideration.
The ufuge of Congress Ims also been referred
to â¢ and il we look at the> arts under the ex.i.-
iuf constitution. we (hall find they are general.y
tit&otherefultof a liberal conftinu<tion. I will mention
but two. The firft relates to the eltablifhinent
Â°* 'he executive departments and gives to the
President th< power of removing officers. As the
confutation is silent on this fubjecS, the power
mentioned by the gentleman's own reasoning, is
veiled in the states or the people: he, however
contended for an afumptio/i of the power, and
when alliuned urged that it flionld be verted in
the 1 refidenr, although, like the power of ap
pointment, it was by a refpetfiable minority in
both Houses, conceived that it should have been
verted in the President and Senate. His rule of
interpretation then, was therefore more liberal
than it is now. In the other cafe Congress deter
mined by law, with the fanrtion of the President,
when and where theyfhould hold their next ses
sion, although the conrtitution provides that this
power /hall reft solely in the two Houses. The
gentleman also advocated this measure, and yet
appears to be apprehensive of the conf'equences
that viay reliilc from a conrtruiftion of the con
stitution which admits of a national bank. But
from which of these measures is danger to be ap
prehended ! The only danger from our interpre
tation would be the exercifc by Congress of a
general power to form corporations: But the
dangers resulting from the gentleman's interpre
tations, in the cases alluded to, are very diffe
rent ; for what may we not apprehend from the
precedent of having assumed a power on which
the constitution was silent, and from havin K an
nexed it to the supreme executive? If we have
this right in one instance, we may extend it to
others, and make him a despot. And here I
think it neceflary to declare, that such is my
confidence in the wisdom, integrity and iniH'ce
Â°f the chief magistrate, as that 1 should be at
V 1!, 6 ' rn y Il^c > liberty and property were at his
tlifpofal: but this is a trust which lam not au
thorized to make for my constituents; and as his
luccef.ors in office will poflefs equal powers, but
may not poflefs equal virtues, caution with ref
petft to them is necelTary. Againâwhat may be
the result of the precedent relating to the session
of Congress ? ]f we had a right by law to deter
mine where the next Congress should hold their
lemon, one Congress may oblige another to fit
at Kentucky, or in the intended state Yazoo un
der the protection of a Chiclaw Chief, or his ex
cellency Governor Tallan. It must therefore be
that the usage of Congress in both in
ltances is against the gentleman, and that the
clangers from the precedent of eflablifhing a bank
are comparatively small to those resulting from
the other measures referred to. to
The gentleman from Virginia has endeavored
to support his interpretation of the conltitution,
by the sense of the federal convention ; but how
is this to be obtained ? By applying proper rules
of interpretation ? If so the sense of the conven
tion is in favor of the bill ; or, are we to de
pend on the memory of the gentleman for an
hilrory of their debates and from thence to col
lect their sense ? This would be improper, be
cause the memories of diffef-ent gentlemen would
probably vary, as they have already done, with
refpetf to those fadts ; and if not, the opinions
ot the individual members who debated are not
to be considered as the opinions of the conven
tion. Indeed if they were, no motion was made
in that convention, and therefore none could be
reje<sted for establishing a national bank : And
the measure which the gentleman has referred
to, was a proposition merely to enable Congress
to erecft commercial corporations, which was and
always oaght to be negatived.
The gentleman's arguments refpedting the
Fenfe of the State conventions, haveas little force
as those relating to the federal convention. The
debates of the State conventions, as publiftied by
the short hand writers, were generally partial
and mutilated ; in this, if the publications are to
be relied on, the arguments were all on one fide
of the question, for there is not in the record
which is said to contain the Fennfylvania de
bates, a word against the ratification of the con
ltitution : Although we all know that arguments
were warmly urged on both fides. The gentle
nian has quoted the opinions, as recorded in the
debates of this State and North-Carolina, of two
ot our learned judges : But the speech of one
member is not to be cohfidered as exprefli ng the
sense of a convention ; and, if it was, we have
no record which can be depended on, of such
speeches. Indeed had even this been the cafe
the union was at that time divided into two
parties, one of which feared the loss of the union,
if the conltitution was not ratified uncondition
ally, and the other the loss of our liberties, if it
was. The objetft on either fide was so important '
as perhaps to induce the parties to depart from
candor, and to call in the aid of art, flattery, pro
lelhons of fnendfhip, promises of office, and even
good cheer, were recurred to : And when tliefe
failed, the federal Bull was published, denoun
cmg political death and de(lru<ftion to antifede
ral infidels.âUnder such circumstances the opin
ions of great men ought not to be considered as
authorities, and in :jnny instances could not be
recognized by theniJelves.
Mr. Gerrt then observing that the sense of
the States refpediing a bank would be best ascer
tained by their legislative aÂ«fts, fbewed from the
journals of Congress, that when retrained by
the confederation from exercising any powers
but what were exprtfsly delegated, Congress had
without any authority established a bank, whose
capital might extend to ten million dollars ; and
had not only pledged the faith of the union not
to eredt any other, but liad recommended it to
the States to prohibit any State eftablifliment of
the kind, and had also determined that the bank
bills fliould be receivable in the taxes and duties
of every State : That the States did not remon
strate againlt or tacitly acquiesce in, but atfiually
supported the measures of Congress relative to
the bank, wliillt the war conrinued and after the
peace : That this w4s the ftrongeit evidence the
States could give, that they thought the measure
salutary, and had no objection to it, on the
ground of its being conllitutioiiaj. He then urg
ed that if the States and the people at large had
no objection to a bank in that cafe, they certain
ly could not in this ; and enquired whether there
was any evidence of their disapprobation of such
an institution in the debates of their conven
tions or propofitioris for amendments ? To this
he answered in the negative, and urged that
whilst the conventions were silent on this fubjedt,
and had no objedions to such a measure, several
of them had proposed amendments to the consti
tution, for retraining Congress from eftabli/hing
commercial corporations ; which evinced their dis
approbation of such inditutions and admitted at
the fame time, in some degree, the power of
Congress, under the existing conilitution, to form
them.
. Mr. GERRythen shewed, that as a monopoly
has been urged as an objection to the bill, 110
fucb consequence could refitk from it : For the
bill does not restrain State or private banks, or
even individuals, from negociations of a similar
nature withthofe permitted to the stockholders ;
nor does it restrain the States from forming simi
lar corporations. This plan has not a feature of
monopoly,and thegentlemen whooppofe it, con
tend for a bank which according to its original
institution was founded in monopoly.
He then answered the argument urged ao*ainft
the authority of Congress, to enable corpora
tions to hold lands, when they had no power them
selves of purchasing and holding land ; and shew
ed that although Congress are reflrained from
purchasing lands (except in certain cafes)and from
exercising over the fame exclusive legislation ; yet
that they may hold lands obtained by execution,
conquest, and by other means as well as by those
clauses of the constitution which relate to lands
now belonging to the union ; and that Congress
had often inveftedothers with powers which they
themselves could not exercise.
He then noticed the argument, that, by a law
of Virginia, notes payable to the bearer, or or
der, could not circulate in that State ; and ob
served that this law could not be fuppofedto ex
tend to bank notes ; and if it did, it would be
null and void, becaule the constitution of the
union and laws, made in pursuance thereof, were
paramount to the laws and conllitutions of the
leveral States. Havingconfidered the arguments
againlt the conflitutionality of the bill, he en
tered into the policy and utility of the measure.
âIn his remarks on this head we ffiall not fol
low him.

Extratt of a letter from Petcrfourg y Dec. 22
" An authentic lift has been published here of
the forces of the Ruffian empire, with a state
ment of the lofles fuflfered, both by the land ar
my and that of the sea, during the lafl three
years. This loss, including the sick and deser
ters, is estimated at 130,000 men.
" The Ruffian army consists of four parts, the
guards, the Campaign Troops, the Garrifonsand
the Irregular Troops. The Guards amoanted to
9967 men, but the Swedilh war has reduced them
to 5036 men ; the Campaign Troops were 48,441
cavalry, whom the war has reduced to 25,300;
and 121,554 Infantry, which now amount to on
ly 61,300. The garrisons, which were 103,226
men, are reduced to 69,100 ; the Irregular Troops
were 127,000 strong, but now are reduced to
63,500. The army of the Empress, therefore,
before the war, amounted to 409,978 men; her
lofles amount to 223,180; but as above 100,000
recruits have been railed, the armv has not left
above 130,000 men, and of course there still re
main about 280,000 men at present."

Opinion of tile Judges on the protesting of bills.
The court were clearly of opinion, that inland
bills of exchange, drawn after fight, could not
be protested for non-payment, as those only
which were drawn afterdate were within 'l ,c
words of the statute of King William, by which
protests were introduced, and for which, it ex
pressly fays, that sixpence only shall be taken.
1 he Court were also unanimouflv of opinion,that bills subject to be protested, could not by
]aw be protested, until the day after the day on
which they became due.
Two ot the judges also were of opinion, that
there is no difference between the contract creat
ed by a bill of exchange, and any other contract,
as by mortgage, bond, lease, &c. &c. where the
party has the whole of the last day on which he
â undertakes to discharge himfelf from the obli
gation.
But one of the judges differed 111 opinion on
this point, and thought a bill of exchange was
not like a condition to pay money on a certain
day, but was a contract only ta pay the money
on the day, if the bill was presented for payment.
The demand, he said, ought to be made in a rea
sonable time of the day; for that if an acceptor
had the whole of the day, the Bankers clerks
would be in a terrible situation, for they would
then be obliged to be at every man's lioufe until
the last period
The other judge declined giving his opinion
on this point of the cafe.
At length the National Adembly have adopted

Her name he sullied by a villain's art ;
Remorse now forces the nerve-fliaking sigh,
While fierceft madness fires her sparkling Eye.

And hobbles like a wretch on crutches.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FENNO,
YOUR correspondent has favored me with some remarks upon
mine inanfwer to his former ftriftures on the fubjeft of the
proposed Bank of the United States. I was to be sure wrong
when I appealed to private feelings, or to the passions of men, in
favor of an old and venerable Institution, to which time had gi
ven its fan&ion, and the country was greatly' indebted for its free
dom ; for what are passions, or the finer feelings, when compared
to the all-subduing cry of National Policy, or expediency, against
which-very often not even the voice of reason has been found to
prevail : There are, however, those, who think that on this occa
sion, the national gratitude might well have been made consistent
with the national policy ; and that the Bank of North-America
would have proved fully commensurate to all the purposes of go
vernment, had government been pleased to resort to it : Since,
however they have resolved otherwise, I am clear for supporting
the Old Bank, in memory of what it has done; and I have no
doubt of its meeting with all the countenance of the monied and
commercial interests of the State, that will be neceflary to preferre
it on its present very refpe&able footing; for this I rely on the
enlightened minds of our citizens in general, who cannot but fee
the hazard of rifquing all in one bottom, and the greater chance
they have of being well served by a salutary competition between
two â¢ I relyalfoon the wisdom of the State, that cannot do bet
ter than to patronize its own Bank, as its pecuniary facilities mud
be so greatly dependant upon it, and accordingly in the present
session the legislature have fully (hewn their convi&ion of the
truth and solidity of this reasoning.
As to the observation " that the Bank of North-America have
accepted and acted under a new Charter from the .State of Penn
" fvlvania, materially variant from the original one, and which fa
" narrows the foundation of the Injlitution, as to render it an incompe
" tent basis for the extenjive purposes of a National Bank," and the
inference drawn from all this fine reasoning, that another Bank
was eflential, it is only neceflfary to answer, That it was no fault
of the Bank that Pennsylvania abrogated its original charter ; and
as it was no fault of the Bank's, it ought not to operate to its pre
judice ; nor was it neceflary that it (hould, since Congress could
just as easily, the State Charter notwithstanding, have extended
the foundation of this narrowed Institution, as they could eftab
lifti the so broad one they have at present projected.
In fact there is no eflential difference between the two Banks,
but what lie in the compass of the following circumstances : The
introduction of a capital of Â§ public debt in the New Bankâthe
narrowing of the privilege of voting of persons not resident in the
Unionâthe power of branching out the Bank over Americaâ
the latitude of carrying it on wherever the Dire&ors chooseâthe
extending their number to 25â the forcibly turning one fourth of
them out every yearâand the compelling the subscription for
bank flock to be kept open until 25000 (hares be fubfenbed ; and
I will venture to fay, that in every one of these particulars, the
Bank of North-America is on a better footing for the concerned,
than it is poflible the new one (hould be, if the following por
tions be true, and I believe they arc, to wit. That gold and silver
are a better basis for a Bank than paper of any kind whateverâ
that freedom of votes in all the Stockholders is the palladium of
the fafety of a//âthat a Bank limited in its operations to one cer
tain place, is more fccure and liable, than one liable, like the
winds of Heaven, to be wafted every whereâthat twelve Direc
tors are a more responsible body, than twenty-five, of which se
ven may form a quorum âthat a perfect freedom of ele&ion is
better than a forced change of it, and that a flock limited by the
Stockholders to the amount of their wants and business, is better
than one compelled by neceflity to be left open, till an amount be
fubferibed beyond any poflible scale of utility or of profit.
The reasonings of the Secretary of the Treasury, in his report
on the fubjett of the Bank, are with me as inconclufivc, as were
his pofiuons on the fubjeft ot the deferring payment of part of the
interest of the national debtâboth measures I have ever thought
unnecelTary and inexpedient.
I think it was as needless at present to erect a new Bank on the
plan piopofed, as I thought it impolitic in the latter part of his
firft Report, to fee him propofeany thing short ot the fulleit and
amplest iuftice contemplated in the beginning of it. Time how
ever mull do its own office, and (hew who has been in these
theoretic discussions. lam willing to take my chance in the lon*
[un for its approbation, and bope that in its progress, the Bank ot
A': on.

North America will evince, by the profit and extent of its n

proteÂ£lthis Institution, I have thought a laudable undertaking; I
am sure to preserve it on its present ground is of confcqusnce ; arid
having thus had in view only systems of public utility, no way
incompatible, but rather auxiliary to the (upport of the general
government, I shall be consoled by my motives, whatever m-j-y
chance to be their iflue.
I can not conclude without noticing the very fublimc prcduc
tions of the Bard, who has introduced the Bank of the United
States, into his Flower Garden of the Muses : He certainly de
serves credit at lead for the novelty of the design, since like the
" Observer," he was disposed to play upon the fancy, he cannon
but greatly excel him, having chofcn a vehicle fomuch better suit

powers on a fubjeft so unpromising and sterile as a monied bank
seems, by its very nature, calculated to prove to the finer and moie
dclicate orgai.s of a poet.
