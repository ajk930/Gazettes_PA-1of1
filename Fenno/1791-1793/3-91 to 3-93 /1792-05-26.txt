GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Prejiient oj the United States.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
A REPUBLICAN government is of all modes undoubtedly
the best. The eflential mark and principal chara&eriftic
of such a government, is, that the people are governed by laws
enacted bv their own representatives. Under this character,
all men furelv will agree to prefer a republican mode. My
education, habits and reflections, have so riveted my attach
ments, that it would be difficult for me to subdue them so far
as to live under any other. I should feel a want
of that firm ground of security which an American treads on.
Like an inhabitant of Calabria, which is often shaken by earth
quakes, I should think myfelf on a thin crust of earth, walking
over caverns of sulphur. For a despotic government can nei
ther enjoy fafetv, nor give it. Accordingly, the zeal of pa
triots and philosophers to preserve republican government, is
not less rational than ardent and universal. The good sense
and virtue of the world seem to be all on the fame fide. The
means which tend to perpetuate this blefling to the citizens of
the United States, cannot be too diligently fought, nor too
firmly established. Knowledge among the great body of the
people, is worth every other security of liberty. It is not only
the firft and best security, but it is absolutely efTential. There
is no fafety without it. An ignorant free people ! a solecism.
Banish knowledge from a republicâthe foul leaves the bodyâ
the inert mass will soon corrupt. It is the strength of the
body politicâwithout it, like Sampson shorn of his hair, it is
bound by the weak, and despoiled by the profligate. Every
school-house protetts liberty more efle&ually than a fort, or a
regiment guards the frontiers.âWhy then is it not the firft
care of every American patriot to provide for school*. Year
after year pasTes away, and this work, which it takes a gene
ration to accomplish, is negle&ed. O mighty ignorance, that
haft ere&ed empires and levelled republics with the dust, we
fjar thou wilt outlive all thy enemies ! PHILO.

[The following extradts from letters of Mr.
John Parker Boyd, of this town, now in India,
evince the genius and enterprise of that young
gentleman, and (hew much of that spirit of ad
venture so peculiar to Bollonians.]
" Being well allured that whatever relates to
me, will in foine measure be interesting to you,
I (hall therefore just inform you of my present
situation.
" Fourieenth June last, after having procured
recommendatory letters to the English consul,
residing at the court of his Highness the Nizam,
I proceeded to this capital, Hyderabad, being
4JO miles from this place. On my arrival I was
presented to his Highness, in form, by the Eng
iifti consul : My reception was favorable as my
mod sanguine wishes had anticipated.
" After the usual ceremony was over, he pre
sented me with the command of two Ranfolars

PETERSBURG, May 17.
Several alarming accounts have been received
in this town, of a very dangerous infurre<ftion
among the negroes on the Eastern Shore of Vir
ginia ; the particulars of which we have not been
able to obtain :âReports state, that about two
weeks ago, the negroes in that part of the state,
to the amount of about 900, aflembled in differ
ent parties, armed with mu<kets, spears, clubs,
&c. and committed several outrages upon the in
habitants. A favorite servant of Col. Savage's,
who had joined them, met his mailer on the
road, took his horse and some money from him,
and treated him in a very insolent manner. Ca
leb, a negro the property of Mr. Simpkitis, was
to command this banditti ; he was also a favorite
servant of his matter's, and had long lived with
him in the capacity of an overseer. A barrel of
mulket balls, about ;oo spears, some guns, pow
der, provisions, &c. have already been discovered
and taken ; the spears it is said were made by a
negro blacksmith on the Ea?ern Shore. A con
fidwable number of the negroes have been taken,
450
and it is expected will be hanged. The militia
have turned out, and are obliged to keep con
iiant guard.
It appears by a letter which has been lately
discovered in Norfolk, from one of the negroes
on the Eastern Shore, that they had concened a
plan with the negroes about Norfolk and Pnrtf
mouth, to commit foine violent outrages in and
about those two towns. The letter Ytates, that
6co of them were to orofs over the bav, at a cer
tain time in the night, and when thev arrived
at these towns, they were to be joined by the
negroes in that neighbourhoodâthey then meant
to blow up the magazine in Norfolk, and mafia
ere the inhabitants. Since the difcoverv of this
letter, a guard of fifty men in each of the towns
of Norfolk and Portfimouth, has been regularly
kept up; several negroes have been taken up un
suspicion, and lodged in jail, and a number of
guns have been discovered concealed under holl
ies and other secret places, all loaded, mod of
which were Englilh mnfKetswith fixed bayonets.
It is hoped that a timely check will be niven to
this alarming outrage.
The present unguarded situation of our coun
try renders the above circumllances more parti
cularly interestingâand it is hoped will be a
means of urging our rulerito make some (peedy
and effe<Sual provision for arming and organiz
ing the militia, which for three years part has
been mod fliamefnlly neglerted, and has left US
almofl destitute of every means of defence.

And I shall be better informed how to remedy
the defeats, in a more fatisfatfory manner than
has hitherto been praftifed. On enquiry of the

employed in the vicinity of Reading, each ot

from to 16 tons. Some few lately have not
exceeded 5 tons, since the waters have fallen ;

By late arrival 1 ; from France the subsequent intelligence is re
ceived, vizâThat the Emperor Leopold died apparently of a
Vomica of the lungs; his sudden death had given room for
many conjectures at ViennaâThat his successor was very
sickâThat bv the Emperor's death, France will be quiet the
cnfuing fall, and providence will provide for the reftâThat
the three ministers, M. Cahier de Gerville for the home-de
partment, and M. Molleville of the marine-department, and
M. Narbonne of the war-department, had demanded and ob
tained leave to relign ; M. Narbonne wilhed war to have
been declared agaiuft the Emperor 011 account of his declining
to give France the explanation deinanded-of him the 12th of
January ; he always giving evasive answers; but M. de Lef
fart and the Kingbeing of a different opinion,compelled him to
resign : The f 1 rft news from France will inform us of the fate
of M. de LelTart, who, it is said, is arrettedâThat a few days
after the arrival of M. Burgoin, at Madrid, the famous Count
Florida Blar.ca was disgraced and difinilTedâThat Count
d'Aranda has succeeded him ; that Minister was advising the
King of Spain to break his alliance with France, and had in
troduced into Spain such inquilitori.il regulations and ways of
governing, that it was dangerous to speak about political af
fairsâthat he is not at all regrettedâThat all his schemes
have fallen with himâand that Count d'Aranda is now re
pairing all the wrongs he has done to the French, and to in
dividuals."
" The a r ticles produced by our farms for many years past,
have been liberally paid for. Agriculture therefore has not
languishedâevery branch of mechanic industry seems at no
loss for its due recompenceâand the state of our public funds
and exchanges do not show any scarcity of money, or want of
zeal to employ it."

An freaking of the late Emperor of
Germany fays :â u Wherever he himfclf went, tranquility
followed his ftep~. In Hungary every symptom of difcoateut
was done away by his prefence.âln Bohemia all was made ea-

' " By his death, it is much to be feared, very different scenes
may be opened. A young Prince, in the Archduke, and heir
to his crown, may be too fond of war. He may liiten too rea
dily to the inHnuations of the emigrants, and be too hasty to
revenge l'uppofed aifronts upon his territories. 111 short, by
the death of the late Emperor, we may again fee a great part
of Europe deluged in blood. At all events, the loss of a good
man is ever to be regreted, especially in a Prince; and when
it happens through foul means, the instigators and perpetra

Extrafl of a letter jrom a gentleman at Gibraltar, to his correspondent
in this city, dated March 1.
" The emperor [of Morocco] Yezid, having made a forced
march, and eluded the army commanded by Ben Alfar, puflied
011 to the city of Morocco, where he arrived about the lecond
of February, but the gates being flint against him, he attacked
the place, and carried it on the 6th, when he committed the
greatest excelfes, and once more gave up the devoted Jews to
plunder ; many friends as well as enemies fuffered from the
rapacity of the army.âOn the 12th Muley Ifhem reached the
plain of Morocco, with a considerable army, said to conljft of
thirty thousand men, where the emperor with about halt that
number met them, and after an engagement which continued
from ten to two o'clock, obtained the victory. Oi Ifhem's
army thirteen hundred were killed, and eight hundred taken
priloners, some difperled themselves, but the greatest part re
treated towards Jaffe. The emperor's lofswas inconfiderabl#,
but he was himfelf wounded in two or three places, and the
use he made of his success was to put the prisoners to death,
not one of whom did he pardon. He ordered them to be nailed
up against the walls, and upon the floors where they happened
to be, and he prohibited all persons from administering any
kind of relief to them. He also put to death, without any ap
parent reason, two Christians that had been several years em
ployed by his father as stone-cutters, and two Frenchmen who
had pafled into the country from Ceuta. In lliort, from the
12th to the 16th such a scene of slaughter was exhibited as,
in Morocco, has feldombeen heard of. On the 16th, however,
it pleafetl heaven to put an end to it, for on that day the em
peror died of his wounds."
Extract of another letter from the fame gentleman, dated March i 6. j
" Slema (or rather Selima) who I think will govern at last 1
in the kingdom of Fez, has, upon the whole, an amiable cha
racter. He is humane and temperate, religious and supersti
tious, a dutiful son to his mother, and a lover of peace. He
has declared himfe'f a friend to commerce, and an enemy to
every thing cruel or treacherous. An Alcaide, who had at
tached himfelf to the late emperor in a diflinguifhed manner,
upon the death of his master retired to a fan&uary, but Slema
Cent him a meflage applauding his condu&, telling him lie had
nothing to fear, and exprelling a wifli that, it ever himfelf
should be reduced to distress, he might have a few such faith
ful adherents, as the Alcaide had been to his brotherâ u By
the best and most moderate accounts the number of people
Yezid (the late emperor) caused to be put to death from his ar
rival before the city of Morocco, until he died, which was a
bout two weeks, exceeded twenty thousand ; among whom
were, without refpeft to age or sex, all who had any connec

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
Industry is the source of wealthâmines are found to impo
verish a nation, because more is loft by their leaving off work
than is dug out of the earth. Toproteftand encourage in
dustry therefore is the true way to augment the wealth of our
nation. The certain protection afforded to property in En
gland is probably the principal cause of the wonderful prospe
rity and almost inexhauftable resources of that people. Free
and prosperous as our country is, it becomes us to fee whe
ther our laws have not raised some obstacles to t?he industry of
our citizens, and if we discover any such it will be proper to
reform them. Men would not work if others could intrude
into their affairs and controul the disposal of their earnings.
The mode of taxing by arbitrary afTellment which obtains in
most of the States is unfavorable to indultry. In theory it is
right and proper that the contributions to govornment should
be made in the ability of those who pay. But if
this equality of afledment is to be obtained only by laying open
the dealings and private tranfaftions of those who pay taxes,
it is better and would give more fatisfaftion to obtain the sup
plies for the State a furies by some other mode. Equality
however, after all the prosecution of the most drift and invi
dious enquiries is not to be obtained. In some of the States a
man is taxed for the profits of his calling or trade; it becomes
his interest to conceal his gains instead of enjoying the repu
tation that (kill and industry are entitled to. It is scarcely
poflible to imagine a more effectual damp to the spirit of en
terprize ; if a man drains a fwainp, and it becomes a fine mea
dow, the tax gatherers are sent after him as if he had smug
gled the property without paying the duties.
Thele things ought not to be so.
Calumny is an odious vice ; the propensity to it marks a
mind devoted to malignant paifions, and deeply corrupted.
Accordingly the worst and baieft of men are thole who most
readily believe ilanderous reports. The conversation of some
persons turns wholly on the faults and vices of their acquaint
ance. They deal so much in dark suspicions and foul pra&ices
imputed to others that at length it becomes their sole delight.
Virtue, worth and talents, or any clean wholesome fubjeft of
praise, disgusts these Hottentots in morals ; they chufe to live
by carnagc, and to be drefTed in the putrifying spoils of their

ten leave us in doubt of the characters they havd traduced,
but they fix our averiion to their own. Worthy perions are
neither very lulpicious nor very censorious. Those who de
light in the (landers against Congress which of late ieein to
rain upon us from the newspapers Ihouldlet a guard upon their
own hearts, left they iliould be tainted with the malignant
paifions which ihfpire their authors. Foreigners and the back
country people on reading the inlinuations against ipeculators
in Congress, and innumerable other vile flanders agaiiilt the
members which touch their integrity as men, wouiu at once
conceive a deep abhorrence of a government infuch abomina
ble hands ; they would conceive them to be men without caa
ratterâwithout principle, without Ihame. As theie
iions are thrown chiefly 011 the supporters of the funding sys
tem the bank and excise, they are doubtlels intended to pro
duce their full etfedt with those who are averle to those acts,
in order that those who hate the measures may be persuaded
that the men who agree to them are still worle. To all this
nothing can be replied. Thole gentlemen coni'cious of the pu
rity of their characters and views, can only wonder in iilence
at the audacious profligacy of the llanderers.
" The people of America can never be too careful of their
liberty," and of that government on which its exiftcnce de
pends; for, as a late writer, speaking of the French He volu
tion,fays, there is as inseparable a connection between liberty
and government, as there is between defpotilin and slavery.
The people of the United States are now in pofTeflion of
what great part of the European world are laboring to obtainâ
a government of their own choice. This is the glorious re
ward of our facrifices in a long and bloody warâthis com
pleated the revolutionâand while every real friend to the
happiness of mankind molt ardently wishes success to the strug
gles of opprefled humanity in the eastern hemisphere, he will
spurn with indignation every infiduous attempt to blast the
profpe&s of his country, under the auspices of that govern
ment whose basis is freedom, and the equal rights of man.
The funding system is the 44 Att making provision for the
public debt." Had the system made no provision for the pub
lic creditors, we should have heard no complaints; at least
from those who uever trulted their property on the uncertain
ilTue of the contest with Britain. To pay, is the rub, with
those who feel neither for the prosperity, dignity or freedom
of the United States, let their pretences be what they will.
The speculators have bought up the certificates, and they
have centered in the great trading cities, at a price far below
their present value. The blame is thrown upon the funcfing
system, upon its author, and those who supported it.-âls this
just ?
The delay of the funding law in its paflage was made by its
foes, not by its friends. If then a long space of time was af
forded to draw the certificates from the distant states, the fault,
if any, must fall on those who caufedthe delay. The low price
of the certificates was not owing to the friends of the law.
The opposition was so great as to make it improbable that the
state debts would be aifumed; and it was very doubtful whe
ther the other debt would be funded at all. This hazard de
pressed the price of the paper. The value would have funk
to alinoft nothing, had the law been finally reje<sted. The
price paid for the paper before the law palfed, after allowing
for the rilk, was, poflibly, as much as the true value. Had
the law been reje&ed, the paper would have been left on the
hands of the buyers, and the fellers who now complain
would have received three times as much as the market price.
Would any one have had a mind to make up to the buyers of
state paper their loss, if it had not been afluined.
However, the transfer of the certificates, under such cir
cumstances of disadvantage to the holders, is truly to be re
gretted.
No occupation requires less talent or merit of any kind than
railing and finding fault. It is the opinion of many who know
the authors of newspaper calumnies, that those fucceedbeft iu
this way, who are totally unqualified to ast in any other. To
bawl knave, (peculator, aristocrat, partizan of monarchy re
quires but a trifling (lock of modesty, candor, refpeft, for
truth, decency, or the public tranquility.

BLOOMSBURY,
THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in New-Jersey, occupied for wmiy years part by
the fubferiber; containing upwards of 200 acres of land, besides
a tra& of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is. laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the (aid street on the east, and by the river on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined effect of fili
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the most
beautiful and desirable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
bandfome, well-fmifhed brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a twoftory brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as inclading the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both (ides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new fton;
coach-house and stables, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining theft is a very complete granary,
rat proof, and a stone cow-house, upwards of iÂ©o feet in length,
containing thirty-one paved flails, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, &c. Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is agar
f den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich colle&ion of the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large asparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well
built, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheese-room,
spring-house, garden, See. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
ceirary out-building. The ground is properly divided into Jmall
fields, all well watered, highly imptoved, and chiefly under the
most approved grass. This square has produced annually, tor se
veral years past, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, besides
supporting through the summer season twenty to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper seasons,
with great plenty of all kinds of fifti usually found in frefh water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both of which
may afford a pleasing amusement to the sportsman, as well as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is inclofcd and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar polls,
and rails of chefnut and white cedar. The purehafer may have
the improved square separately, or the whole together, as may
bed suit him. There is an incxhatiftible iquantity of good build
ing stone on the river shore. The purchase money, if well secured,
and the interest pun&ually paid, will not be demanded for many
years.
Any pei Ton desirous of viewing the piemifes, may be gratified
on applieation to Samuel W. Stockton, Esq. of Trenton,
or Mr. Inallman, who at present occupies the farm-houfeand
part of the landâand may know the price on application tf> the
