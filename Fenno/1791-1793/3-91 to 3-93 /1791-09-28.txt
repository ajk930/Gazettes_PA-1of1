Young Gentlemen,
â¢*- HHHE occasion which has devolved on me the duty of addreflinÂ®
X you. cannot fail to impress your minds with an uncommon
degree of ferionfnefs.
Your bf loved Prcfideor, from whofc lips you have been accus
tomed to rcccive leflonsof Wisdom, is not here to give you his last
bened : .sionâHe is gone to the World of Spiritsâand, as we hope
and trust, to receive the rewards of his labours of Love and o!
Virtue. v
The Pjtrons of the College could not, however, permit you to
bid adÂ«eu to this InlHtution without authorising one of their num
ber to address you.
Alth â > I have not a personal acquaintance with all of you, and
cannor, therefore, be supposed to entertain such an atfeftionate so
licitude for your welfare as vnur immediate Inftru&ors : yet, the
part I have taken 33 an Overseer of ) our progress in learning, and
the former relation I luftained (o this College, for many years, as
a Teacher, awaken in me, on this felemn occasion, the mud len
der and fince-e concern for your future welfare in life.
The pittance of time allotted 10 a collegiate education, can only
fufficc to lay the foundation of learning : the fuperftruÂ£ture mud
be reared bv the adiduous attention of after years.
This day enlarges you into the world. Extensive fields open
to your view. You have to explore the fccnes, and to make an
election of the chara&er ihat bed pleases you on the greet Theatre
" Seekefl thou great thingi to thyf:!J ? Seek them not" said the an
cient p'nohft to Baru k his scholar and icribe. An overweening
fondnefs for our own abilities leads us, in the ardour of youth, to
pourtra> in our imagination future greatness : Time and experi
ence only can corr. 61 the error, and rcduce us to think of ourselves
foberlv, and ?s we ought. Human life is full of difappointmems.
A readmefs to liftcn to council is the furcft mark of wisdom in
youthâ u in the nuhilude of council there is fafctV." When therefore
you are about to take any important step in- life, omit not to con
fuit voup friends; and let your deciGon be the result of deep re
flexion, and the mod careful circumfpe&ion.
If y'ou wish for prosperity in your worldly affairs, rife early in
the mornmg, and attend 10 vour own business with diligence,
pun&uality and orderâpay a sacred regard to truth and justiceâ
live temperately, and moderate your pafTions by listening to the
voice of reason. Take not the lead in falhionsânor fuffer your
selves to be noted for Angularity. Discover your knowledge on
proper occasions, but avoid an affe&ed and pedantic difpl-ty of it
Let the Rights of man ever he h n !d sacredâa moment's reflec
tion will convince vou that others' rights are as inviolable as your
own ; and a small degree of virtue will lead you to refpcfl them.
Hethatferves mankind mod fuccefsfully, and with ihe best prot
einics, serves his Creator mod acceptably. Be cautious of bandy
ing into partiesâthey regard neither the abilities nor virtues of
men, but only the-'r subserviency to present purposesâthey are a
snare to virtue, and a mifchief to society âWith this caution on
your mind, you will never revile or speak evil of whole feÂ£ls,
clatfes or societies of men.
In the choice of friends and companions, rather aspire to those
above vou in life, than fink to those below ; the former line, of
conduct will mark a generous ambition, the latter indicates bafc
nefs and exility of thought ; from the former vou are to ad
vantages. from the latter an incumb r ance. To obtain tins objitt
will require the extension ot your abilities and the growth of your
virtues.
Never aim to rife in life by deprcfling othersâit is more manly
to rely on the of one's own abilities and merit. Avoid
wplifhing or even liflrning to scandal. To mention with plea
lurc the virtues even of a rival, denotes a great mind.
Trifle pot with yourselves, nor fuffer yourselves to be trifled
with by others. If you rightly estimate your own merit, the
Vorld will not long difF.*r from you. Avoid contradictions, or
foften them. Aim to irvftruft and entertain your company ra'her
than to divert them with the affeÂ£lation of wit and scurrility of a
droll.
Render to your superiors dtie refpes. Order is Heaven's firft
law. Nature teaches fubordinaiiouâfocieiy demands it, The
bef\ soldiers make the heft officers, and the bed citizens the best
rulers.âYet carefully difttnguifh the honors paid to rank and of
from those paid to pcrfonal merit ; and let the latter be the
principal object of vour ambition.
Forget not this precious motto â 1 Nihil humanum a in* puto alie
itvm. Consider everv one in h man shape as vour brotherâÂ»nd
ht Chart t\ in goldrn links of love connefl you wit!. ihe Brotherhood of
AWâl et your benevolence be broad as the oceanâyour candor
brilliant as the fun, and your compaflion and humanity cxtcnfive

BERLIN, July 10.
ON the 4th, the Prince Henry gave an enter
"tainmenr, and erected the monumentrin ho
nour of the Prince of Pruflia, his brother, the fa
ther ofjour Monarch. The concourse of people
aflefiibVed on the occasion was imrornl'e. As
was infufficient to contain all the peo
ple aflembled, it became necefl'ary for
thenj to SÂ»perfe themselves in the neighboring
villages. The Prince invited to the entertain
mertt all the" subalterns and soldiers of our gar
rison who had served in the war of seven years,
and defrayed their expences.

betrothing will take place at Potfdain, in

occawon there will be great rejoicings as well in
this capital as at Poifdam. The marriage, it is
(thought, will take place in autumn, at the fame
time as that of the Princess Wilhelmina with the
Hereditary Prince of Orange.

Our Monarch, not content with having fer a

Yesterday morning an immense croud repaired
to the Champ de Mars, to sign the petition allud

persons concealed below the Altar, dedicated to
Gallic Freedom, the people unfortunately fuf
petfed them of an intention of blowing it up by
means of gun-powder, and atftualjy, in violation
of every idea of Jaw and of jultice, executed
them on the spot.
On notice of this, the Municipal officers imme
diately repaired to the Champ de Mars, aCeoi#-

any thing against the National Allembly.
July 21. M. Duveyrier, the comniiffioner dis
patched Come time since to the royal fugitives at
Worms, has given an account of the events of his
million. On the 17th 1 e set off from Paris with
M***, his cousin and old friend, one of the king's
Guards- On the 21 ft, at nine o'clock in the even
ing, he arrived at Worms, and intimated hismif
fion to M.Conde. The next day he followed him
to Coblentz. The Eletflor of Treves, and M.
d'Artois, and de Conde had a after
which they dispatched M. Duveyrier to Aude
mack. They told him that his miffioildilpleafed
M. Conde, and still more the French officers,
which the latter fufficiently niatked by injurious
treatment. He in vain waited foran anftver si om
M. de Conde. Intelligence arrived of the King's
(light. M. d' Artois went to Aix-la-Chapelle, and
M. de Conde to Worms. M. Duveyrier took the
road for France, and passing through Lnxem
bourgh, in which city M. Bouille and his fnit then
were, he was jrrefted and detained twenty-two
days, w'ithour permission to write. He was in
fuhed by French officers in prison ; and at last,
conduced by a parry of hulans, w ho left him on

The Jacobineg' Club is no longer frequented
by thole who value their reputation ; fiuce the
schism, formed by the fece llion of all the Mem
bers of the National Afiembly, only Bankrupts in
honour and in fortune, continue to herd together
in that den of anarchy and inifchief. We at all
limes afTerted that the Jacobines were a national
nuisance, and would finally, if not obflrutflcd,
cause the ruin of France ; the conduit of the ma
jority of that Club, with refpeft to the decree iff
lued in favor of monarchy, evinces that we pre
dicted right ; it was through them that the riot
on Saturday and Sunday arose; they dictated all
the evils which have long diftrat r ted France ; they
aimed at overturning the new fyftein by abolish
ing monarchy, and by encouraging licentious
ness and conhtfion it mud cease then to be a
wonder that the Reprefentaiives of the
have withdrawn thenifelves si om the Jacobines'
meeting place ; they are now in the vicinity of
their own lioufe, the Feuillans, where they

LONDON, July 22
The fpiiic of violence is now so strong against
the King in Paris, that a memorial has been pre-
fented to the National Allembly by a body ot the
people, cjeclaring, " that they will never ac
knowledge Louis XVI. nor any other king, un
less the majority of the nation exprefles a wish to
that efFetfh" In almost every street of Paris,
some one or other was harranguing the mob a
gainst the decree of the Aflembly on the King's
inviolability, when themeflenger came away.
Moderate people, however, th ink that the Na-
tional Afletnbly's granting inviolability to the
King was one of the molt prudent steps they
\ could take to save their coilntry from the hor
>'/ rors of a foreign war. It was next to an impof-
that the Emperor, or the King of Spain,
'conld be quiet fpeiftators of a contrary conduit,
and yet from the intefline divisions of the feve
ral clubs in Paris, their late determination seems
Jto threaten a ( civil war, unless some temporary
LÂ«jÂ®edient be hie upon.
; ."Conflagration and plunder being now held as
" proofs of loyalty, we (hall not wonder at hearing
the deftruiftion of the Dutch dock-yards was oc
casioned by the zeal of some loyal citizens.
No circumstance could be more propitious to
the accomplilhrnent of the French revolution,
than the schism which has revolted so many of
the (liAj des Jacobins. To this society were
united all the lower clubs in the nation embrac
ing republican notions ; its difmembermen!,and
the institution of a new one by the difafFecfted
members, will give a death blow to such ella
blifhinents, and the people will repose, when
tbefe nurseries of faction are destroyed, their
implicit confidence in their immortal National
Aflembly.
Whatever there may be to admire in the plan
of the new constitution of France, its effecfts are
unknown, nor can we prediift by the experience
Â©f former times, for here is a something the
world never saw nor heard of before. Its ad
mirers boast that it is perfeift in all parts, but we
have already found that it is not permanent in
any part ; many of these laws or regulations,
which were intended to be unalterable, have al
ready been altered or expunged ; and though the
whole system is built on a set of abltratft ideas,
and of philosophical speculations, they have al
ready experienced, that they mult, like all other
legislators, yield to cii cumftances, and to the spi
rit of the times. On these accounts, and from
the additional consideration that France is at
present under a system of martial law, its 'con
stitution obliged to be guarded by an immense
standing army, and the people fettered by the
law of pallports, species of flaverv this country
never knew, it was our opinion, that the time
for celebrating an anniversary is not yet come.
If according to their accounts, their constitution
is built, we are certain it is not habitable, and
is destitute of many conveniences, which a build
ing, that they may think more mean, is actually
poileffed of.
From the late meeting in London, danger was
apprehended,and very properly guarded againlt.
In our opinion, the alarm however, was greater
than neceff'arv ; and we could have wished, that
instead of exasperating paragraphs, this meeting
had been treated with silent contempt, or with
ridicule only. But though London escaped the
danger on Thursday, we are very sorry to learn
that other places have not been so fortunate.
Birmingham has been a scene of savage riot. Se
veral houses have been destroyed, anci much va
luable property, For a mob like this, no exctife
can be offered ; nor can we conceive how this
mob were allowed to become formidable without
that earlv and firm oppofijion, which at once de
stroys such combinations. The mifchiei that has
happened, will, no doubt, be ascribed to the Mi
nistry. " It will be said, the ministerial writ
ers," as they are called, incited the mob to de
stroy the houses and chapels of the Dilfeutcrs.
Calumnies like those might be easily refuted, if
a serious refutation were not a compliment to the
calumniators. All that we (hall observe on the
fubjecft, is, that the republican parry may now
fee, thatthe spirit of the people is againlt them :
they will therefore a(ft wifely in forbearing t heir
public rejoicings and anniversaries hereafter,
and reflect (it is an old do&rine) that no good
man or good cifizeii will do that, though he
may be free todo it, which will tend to dilturb
the public peace, and create tumult and confu
fion.
On the 3d June, the managers of the Houfc of

The Empress of Russia is by no means of the

Te Deuni was lately sung in the Polish Church

meant to celebrate.
Dr. Bennet, the Bifliop of Cork, on a late vi
sitation of the Dipcefe, found a number of induf
trions poor using their endeavours to support
large families by the grain and potatoes of small
parcels of land which were charged with tithes ;
this good prelate, in the true spirit of Chrillian
benevolence, not only remitted his (hare of the
tenth of their produce, but ordered the entire a
mount of his tithe to be dillributed among the
deserving poor,'amounting toafuinnot less than
7001. It may be recommended to each of his

The Vienna Gazette presents a circumstance
the more noticeable, as it is the only state paper
iri Europe which has as yet given a decisive opi
nion on the French Revolution ! âWhen that pa

as a rebellion, and the National Aflembly as a felf
created body, there cannot remain a doubt either
of the sentiments or designs of the Emperor.
The terrible fire which confnmed the arsenal
at Ainfterdam, the Dutch are convinced was not
the effect of accident. Each party accuses the
other. The friends of the Stadtholder declare
that the patriots did it to prevent a fleet beina

have therefore infnlted many of them, and never
were cockades sb frequent as now in Amllei dam
since all who appear without them are maltreated.

On Wednesday three troops of the nth regi

troops of the id regiment of dragoon guards,
inarched into the town. Col. DeLanceyarrived
with an aid-du-camp, on Tuesday, froiti the king,
to take command of the military ; and such was
his majesty's anxiety to provide for the fecuriiv
of this neighbourhood, that he had given orders
for four thousand troops to march to onr re.iei
from different quarters. Tranquility, however,
being restored, the progress of the greater part
of them will be flopped.
Several of the rioters are taken, and more a'
known ; and this day his majesty's justices vÂ»s
fit at the Swan Inn, to receive information
(peeking the riots.
The rioters who were taken at Mr. ' a " s n
Belle-Vue, are now confined at Kales-Owc n >
waiting their trials. ,
It is trusted that enquiry will bring out 11-
origin of the late disturbances.

According to letters from Truro in Cornwall,
a meeting of the principal proprietors of the tin

of that article to 31. 12s. per hundred, a higher
price than it has been for many years ; and the
East-India Company have agreed to take half
the tin produced from the County at the above
price.
We are sorry to fay, that the spirit of turbu
lence and disorder has broken out at Sheffield,
where, in the course of last week, the lower class
of people discovered an inclination to riot, in
consequence of the enclosure of the commons of
Stannington and Hallain ; but by the timely in
terference of 1 lie military, which were sent for
from York and Nottingham, the rioters were dis
persed and a period put to the disturbances.
The rioters had previously set (ire tofeveral ricks

By the last accounts all is quiet.
DUBLIN, July 25.
Yederday evening a great nntnber of people

hand-bills which were didributed the preceding
day. â¢ A bom eight o'clock at night, they pro
ceeded to Fleer-lane, where they totally dedroy

many acts of ontrage. The police at length ap
peared, and a defpei ate bat,tle ensued, when the
police were cjmpletely vvorfted. Some lives
were lod on both fides. Elated with their vic

in levelling with the ground the honfes they had
destroyed the preceding evening, when a party
of the 80th regiment arrived, and put an end to
their amusement. The military, having, com

Indeed, since General Scott's expedition in June, a number 01
French inhabitants, who were fettled at feverai ot the Indian vil

An alarming and treasonable riot lately took place in the coun

of the Couit of Common Pleas ; thrfe men were ambitious of be
ing Colonels of militia, and against the commiflioning of whom,
as unfit persons, Mr. Bryfon as County-L'eutenant, had made re
presentations. Enraged at the promotion of Judge Bryfonâone
Wilson, brother to the Sheriff of that County, and one David
Walker levied a considerable force, and marched at the head of
about forty armed men with a fife playing, to Lewis-Town, with
an avowed determination to seize the person of Judge Bryfon,
whilst on the Bench, drag him from thence, oblige him to resign
his commiflion, and to accompany these persons to the rugged
narrows of Juniatta Rivers.
The mob was however fruftrated in their plan, thro'the spi

Bryfon escaped from their handsâand has repaired to the feat of
government. A body of the militia appeared the next day after

The Provost of the University in his charge to the graduates, ob
served, that the wounds and fears which science felt from the un
natural hand of despotism, when her spirit was whetted against
this unoffending country, soon experienced the healing afliftance
of legifla ive authority, to the remotell corners of our confederacy,
liven amidst the ravages of war, and the attention neccffary to re
pel the invasion of a proud and disappointed nation, the State of
P nnfvlvania, ever attentive to the things which constitute her
ft ensrth and among the confederated States, erected
the University of Pennjyfvania at the public expence, without a fin
rle privati donation, or any application from public spirited in
vidualsfor legislative countenance and aid. The institution is
their own, and owes its origin to the wisdom, po'icy and fore
thought of her Representatives eleven years ago, in that dark and
cloudy day, when the scale of battle yet huug doubtful, although
' opcfully verging towards the fide of liberty and independence.
They have seen, I trust, said he, with secret plcafure, the fruits
of their early attention to the interests of literature, in the gradu

of manv of whom begin to unfold, and to promise us the rich
f ru-.ts of a splendid addition to that stock of knowledge in philo
sophy and physic, in law and divinity, which enriches a nation,
and makes them more excellent than their neighbors. And this
day we are happy in exhibiting to their view, and in ushering in
to life, under their auspices, in thecourfeof the present year, as
numerous and refpe&able a class of students in philosophy and me
icine, as were ever graduated in the State of Pcnnfylvania.âAnd
if any thing be yet necefTary to complete their original plan of
enlarging the human mind, and ex3hing the genius of our citi

and magnanimity of one of the largest States 111 the Union, will
vie with the most forward of the confederacy, in piacing their
University upon as refpeSable a footing as any other in America,
and in making it as extenfivcly ufeful to the interests of science,

being fully sensible, that it would be impoflible for them to an

pleasure and advantage by persons of every age ; but to young
minds in particular, it conveys the moil important lessons of life.
SAYS A CORRtIPONDZNT,
Good Government is to be considered as an ordinance of Hea
ven, principally on account of its the medium thro which
we receive all the bleflings of society. Withou*. government there
can be no society, and 110 civil freedom ; all the advantages de
pendant on property arise from government ; and here we mav
di(tinÂ«ui(h the difference between tyranny and government; under
the former, there is nothing but she name of propertyâfor what
we cannot call our own, we cannot be (aid to pojfe/s. That is not
government, but despotism, whether in the hands of one, a few
or many, which does not pay a sacred regard to the rights of pro
perty, as well as to the rights of man ; indeed they cannot be fe
paratcd, for when the former are invaded, the springs of industry,
and a laudable ambition, which are eflennally conne&ed with the
equal rights of man, are attacked and undermined.
175
If is With Government as with Religion, the world abounds
with different systems of each, and the fV6ts which adhere to them
refpeftively pretend in a greater or lefler decree to infallibilityâ
hence the intemperate heats and animosities which interrupt, and
often destroy the peace of society.
It is now generally considered as indicative of narrowness and
bigotry of mind, to deny 10 otheis the right every one is fond e
nough of assuming to h rnfeli, ol judging in a tides of faith. Why
(nould not equal liberty be allowed in chufing our political creed ?
" To err is human"âand mankind are perhaps more liable to er
ror in what concerns their political intereil, than they are in what
relates to modes of religious belief.
It has often been confidently affcrted that religious zeal and
bigotry have deflroyed more of the human race than any other
cause of diflVntiou ; yet the contrary will appear when it 1? conti
dered that mankind have been perpetually at war about civil and
political rights, and their temporal poll ilionsâwhereas religious
wars have raged only at particular periods,and tliofe remote from.
The late accounts from the Weft-India I (lands present the mod
gloomy fpi'ftacle that perhaps has ever been exhibited on the thea
tre of the globe. To reflect on an handful of people (compara
tively speaking) being absolutely in the power of an immense mul
titude of blacks, untaught and uncivilized, whose fenle of injuries
has been constantly receiving an additional keenncft to its edge for
ages, must harrow up every feeling of humanity ; and tho there is
something in our natures which revolts from slavery, and every ge
nerous American must ardently wish to fee the period arrive
When Afric's sons [had freely range their groves,
Pluck their own fruits, and woo their fable loves.
Yet as the new system of tne world is gradually ameliorating the
condition of our species, it is rather to be feared, that the period,
when universal freedom shall be enjoyed, must be retarded, rather
than accelerated by such horrible attempts. On the principle
therefore of universal benevolence and philanthropy, if impelled
by no other motives, the Government of the United States is bound
to afford the most prompt and etteftual succour and relief to their
allies.
According to the late accounts from Cape-Francois, the following
seems to have been dictated by the spirit of prophecyâ
An Address from the Tozun and Commerce of Nantes, to the National
Ajjembly dated May 20, 1791
Gektlemen,
YOUR decree of the 15th May, sublime in the eyes of philofo
phy,and dictated by the\love of humanii y,will not prevent (per nut
this freedom to our patriotism) its being the mod inhumah, if us
execution was not iniprafticable in thr Colonies. More terrible
than thr hurricanes which ravage these rich countries, ?t would
carry with it ail the evils re-united, it goes forth to rc-kindlc upon
these shores already the fpeftacles of horror, the firebrand of dif-'
cord and civil war ; rivers of blood is going to be shed â under
this burning the paflions are extreme, hatred ai d ven
geance will display in their true colours their fanguinaiy tffefts.
Ah do not flatter yourselves that these dreadful misfortunes are
iranfient : No, gentlemen, as long as your fatal decree ihall ex: ft,
the whites and coloured pedple cannot live together ; one party or
tl e other inuft be exterminated : there is no alternative ; and the
conquering party enfeebled by its victory will fall a facrifice to the
(laves, too crafty to let flip the favorable moment of breaking their
chains. Then will those terrible words be realized which have
already made your walls resound, May the Colonics per ijliâ this bar
barous wifli is granted, they are no more âour commerce ruined,
our marine annihilated, agriculture languishing, our manufafturcs
abandoned, ten millions of Frenchmen reduced to the deepefl mi
sery, without the means of fubfiftcnce, wanting bread ; these are
the unhappy consequences, the effect of the loss of the colonics :
bankrupts innumerable, and a general distrust among individuals
will give a fatal itab to public credit ; our fpeeie will flow with
rapidity into the dominions of foreigneis, a general mourning will
cover all France, and more than a third of the inhabitants will be
forced to leave their country, to carry among strangers those ta
lents and that industry which their native foil can no more em
plov.
However gloomy this representation may be, it Is the exaÂ£h ft
truth, and it will make you tremble. It the love of humanity and.
the desire of rendering all the fubjeÂ£U ot the empire happy, ani
mated you when you palfed the decree of the 15th May-âin the
name of the colonies, so precious a part of the French monarchyââ¢
in the name of those whose happiness you wish, while you expose
them to almost inevitable deftruftionâin the sacred name of hu
manityâin the name of ten millions of our brothers who will fall
victims to the most wretched miseryârepeal this crucl decree;
confccrate and adopt in a solemn manner that of the Bth March
179Â° â¢ g rant to the colonies that privilege you promiled them;
themselves alone can re-eftabli(h and maintain good order and
tranquility. This privilege is their palladium, without which our
Colonies cannot exist.

CONJECTURES ON TAXATION
(concluded.)
LET us now consider, what circumstances
(hould determine us in the choice offubjects
of taxation.
Commodities whose manufacture or import are
in the hands of a few, being more easily taken
an account of than those in the hands of many ;
jin ports oil them may be more cheaply collected.
Among manufactured commodities, duties 011
glass and cotton are collected at the lead expence.
A duty upon delfc, stone-ware, bricks, tyles, and
flower-pots, might be levied at a small expence,
thÂ£ charge to be made at the kiln.
That Hage of manufacture which takes up the
largelt time, is the moll proper for taking ac
count of it and charging the duty: Thus, tho
the duty is iinpofed upon drying malr, yet the
account of it is taken when in the cistern, couch,
or 011 the floor, not when it comes from the kiln.
Commodities, therefore, whose manufactures
are more tedious, are preferable to such as are
less so, as fubjeds of taxation. Bleaching being
one of the inoft tedious procefTes we are acquaint
ed with, a duty upou whitened linen or cotton
cloth might be charged at the bleadiing-field
with the greatest certainty.
The advance of duties will be shorter upon
commodities that are not meliorated by keeping,
than Upon such as are improved by age.
Commodities that are fit for use, when they
have pafled through the hands of the manufac
turer, arc preferable as fubje(Ss of taxation, to
those that must be kept for any length of time ;
the "bottle is not the better for the keeping, but
the wine is. Hence, during whatever stage of
its manufaflure, the duty upon acommodity may
be charged, it fliould not be exadied till near the
time the commodity is fit for use : thus the duty
upon glafsmay be sooner exacted, than that up
on wine. The credit given in paying the malt
duty is proper ; for though it does not improve
by keeping, yet the greatest part of it is ,made
many months before it is confuined.
The time of paying the leather duty is fixed
with great propriety.
A moderate impolt upon commodities of gene
ral use or csnfumption produces a greater reve
nue than heavy taxes on such as are consumed
by the few. The annual amount of the duty on
strong beer is about 1,500,000!. The produce of
an impost of 21. per ton on wine was in I 780 ef
timated at 30,c001, per annuv:*.
Commodities of general life are preferable fub
jecfts of taxation, to those that are lei's universally
consumed or iifed.
The great coulumption of whale oil, even in
lighting the Ibeets, renders it probable that an
impost qn it wculd be considerably productive.
Candles are taxed. A duty upon whale oil might
be charged at the boiling-house.
A duty on tin-plates charged at the mill would
be productive : As would oc a duty on gun-pow
der.
Merchants and manufacturers complain when
their particular branches of trade are taxed. It
will, however, be found, that those brandies of
trade and manufacture that have been moderately
taxed for a century pall, have succeeded, as well
as those that have not, or even as such as have
been foftered by bounties.
Moderate impotts on manufactures tend per
haps to halten their improvement, both as a fti
xnulus to ingenuity, and as tending to throw ma
nufactures into the hands of persons poflefled of
flock.
The revenue arising from licences is consider
able ; but it seems to be a very unequal mode of
taxation. As licences are paid at once, if not
exceedingly moderate, they maj, in inany'cafes,
be oppretfive.
Confectioners, perfumers, and hair-dreflers,
might be subjected to the payment of a licence
with as much propriety as the retailers of finall
beer.
The coach-duty may be reckoned a licence
tax; being charged per tale, it is not liable to
the objection of inequality.
A small duty, charged per ton on all (hips and
veflels, might be levied at little expence,and with
great certainty.
"Stamp-duties have, of late, become common ;
all perhaps, that can be said in their favour, is,
that they are cheaply collected. They point out
no particular improvement by which they can
be compensated. They are, in the firft instance,
unequal, and cannot be retailed like imports on
inerchandize or manufacture. In their payment
nothing is seen but the tax.
" There arc two slates in Europe, (C*y3 Mon
tesquieu) where there are heavy imports on li
quor ; in the one, (England) the brewer alone
pays the tax ; in the other, (Holland) it is in
discriminately levied upon all the containers.
In the firft, nobody feels the rigour of the im-
* The ate duty might be rendered ftlil more productive, by
"nakutg Â» reasonable aod equitable alteration in<he brewery laws.
port ; in the fccond, it is looked upon as a griev-
ance."
Stamp-duties will always be obnoxious, and
every effort will be made to evade chem. .There
is no reason to''apprehend, that before the re
ceipt tax can be made efficient, fucb encourage
ment mult be given to informers, as may prove
prejudicial to morals.
In spite of Mr. Sheridan's aflertion, taxes of
this kind are perhaps, of all others, the Jealt
proper for a free people.
