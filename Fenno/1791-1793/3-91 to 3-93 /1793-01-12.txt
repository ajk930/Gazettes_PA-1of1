CONGRESS.
WEDNESDAY, January 1.
DsbAtb on Mr. Steele's motion for
the Reduction of the Military
Establishment of the
United States.
In Committee of the Whole. Mr. White
in the Chair.
Mr. Clark observed that by the debates
this day, it would appear as if it was de
signed to dilband the whole army, and to
give up the whole western country ; but
this is by. an mMDs the cafe; the object
is merely to reduce the number of the re
giments, not to dismiss a single man. He
supposed three thousand men would be
fufficient to contend with 1200 Indians;
the effect of the motion would be to (lop
recruiting ; âit is said the President is em
powered to disband the troops when he
thinks the public service will admit of it;
but this is a point of delicacy ; the law
provides for railing five regiments, the re
cruiting therefore will go on, unless per
haps the Legiflatuie (hail take some lleps
to prevent it. He therefore suggested the
idea of an address to the President of the
United States on the fubjeft.
Mr. Parker said, he was in favour of
the motion. It had been observed, he said,
that the President had it in his power to
disband the regiments; but he observed it i
wag not known what his sentiments are 1
on the fnhicdi. and therefore it. may be_,
highly pinker for this House to express
its opinion. Mr. Parker then fuppwted
his former affettion, that militia was su
perior to regular troops, especially such
as can now be obtained ; the belt men
cannot be* obtained, the war is unpopular ;
and ihetefore such men as turned out in
defence of the liberties of the country
cannot be enlisted. He adverted to vari
ous expeditions against the Indians, be
ginning with Biaddock's defeat. He no
ticed several actions during the late war
with Great-Britain, beginning with Btir
goyne's capture. He gave the militia the
principal credit for many ps our principal
and most brilliant fucccffes. He said, he
had no idea of a speedy peace with the In
dians ; but he exceedingly reprobated the
present fyfttm of prosecuting the war.
HÂ« wm (or reducing the regular establish
ment to a number fufficient to gauifnn
the forts on the frontiers, and to give the
Prelident powertocall militia in such num
bers as he may think proper, and to strike
the enemy where the bed profpeft of suc
cess may appear.
Mr. Boudinot, after remarking that
the present difcuflion was merely a repe
tition of the various observations which
had been offered in the firft deliberations
on the befl mode of carrying on the Indian
war, said the majority determined on the
mode which had been adoptedâFor his
part he had been in the minority ; but the
the sense of the majority mull be fub
witted to; he therefore exceedingly
doubted the eligibility of deviating from
the system, and thus betraying an inlla
bility in the public councils. He advert
ed to tlÂ»e existing Rate of Indian affairs,
the dnpofition recently discovered by
them to treat, and imputed the alteration
in the hoftilc appearance to the arrange
ments made by the United States to pro
secute the war: he therefore exceedingly
doubted the expediency of weakening the
public force at this crifij. He noticed the
interference with, and encroachment on
the Executive, which would be the con
fequeni-e if the measure (liould be adopt
ed. Tiie encrcafed expences occalioned
by the addition to the regular troops
were fully cuulidatcd at the time wben
'I'H"!?' n .ff to i ftVM'awri
Triiimrity For ever keep theii
opposition on foot, by bringing forward
the bulinefs in various (hapes ? He enlarge
ed on the ill policy of adopting the pro
pofitiou at the present moment, and said,
he hoped that nothing would be done to
derange a system which had becu the. re
sult of so much deliberation; on (lability
and firir.neCs, the eventual measures now
pur Cuing to bring about a peace, appear
j to be Cufpended.

Mr. Willis opposed the motion. He
said he had been originally against railing
the additional regimeuts ; but the mo
tion, he conceived, went to such a re
duction of the defenfive force of the fron
tiers, as would leave them in a very ex
ppfed (ituation indeed. No gentleman
would fay, he prelumed, that two regi
ments would be fufficient to garrison all
the posts on the extensive frontiers of the
He had always be<Â»n of
opinion that volunteers and militia were
the bed species of force to be employed
against the Indians; but tho' he had been
opposed to the system adopted, yet he
now considered himfelf as differently situ
ated, and that it was a different cop.fi
deration to oppose a law before it is pas
sed, from continuing that opposition after
it is enadted : he hoped therefore, that
the motion would not be agreed to.
Thursday, Jan. 3, 1793
Mr. Steele, after adverting to the state
ments offered by the Gentleman from
Connedticntj and observing that they dif
fered from those which he had laid before
the House, said, in oider to remove eve
ry prejudice to the motion, he had been
induced to make from motives of regard
to the public goodâ he (hould now more
particularly refer to the documents from
-wltewee-he had drawn his information.â
Mr. Steele then refeied particularly to
the several aÂ£ts of appropriationâto prove
the jultnefs of his (tatements ; after he
had gone thro' with these, he obfeived,
that from hence it mud appear incontior
vertible, that the sums itated to have
been appropriated for thewat department,
were in fadt so appropriatedâwhether
the sums were expended or not, it re
mains for the gentlemen who controvert
those (tatements to (hew. He then (hew
ed that the whole sums were expended,
and monies called for to supply deficien
cies.
Mr. Wadfworth rose to explainâhe
observed that he believed the gentleman's
statement just now delivered by him was
accurateâhe did not mean to controvert
it. In hrsobfervations yesterday, he had
reference to the statement offered by the
gentleman in his fpecch when he brought
forward his motion which had been pub
lifhcd, and the accuracy of which, the
gentleman had not denied ; it was
that statement, Mr. Wadfworth said he
meant to controvert, and not the one now
offered by Mr. Steele.
Mr. Clark said he could not conceive
for what purpose this debate was spun
out to such a length ; he thought ihe
business might be very soon fettled by
proceeding to filling up the blanks in the
motion : he disapproved of the compari
sons which had been made between the
militia and the regular troops ; they had
both, at different times, behaved well,
aud both had perhaps been to blame.
Mr. Milledge rose in opposition to the
motionâhe called the attention of the
House to the extenfivenefs of the fron
tiers of the country, particularly of the
State of Georgia : he noticed the con
duit of the Indians particularly on the
frontiers of that (late ; âthe citizens of
Georgia adopted the constitution of the
United States, in hopes of deriving ef
fectual prote&ion from the Union ; have
they received that proteflion ? A treaty
has been formed with the moll formida
ble tribe on the frontiersâwe have been
ainufed with expectations of their fulfil
ing the coirtraft on their partâbut their
their treatment of Mr. Seagrove may

lent to running the permanent line.â.
Mr: Milledge then noticed the treache
rous conduct of the Indians on fcveral oc
cafious, and from the txtenfivenefs of the
frontiers, being more than 1500 miles in
extentâtheirexcecdingly eipofed situati
on, &c.âHe argued that the force ori
ginally intended to be raised, was so far
from being too great, that it is not ade
quate to the objtft; he was therefore
opposed to the motion. If any of-the of
ficers of government have embezzled the
public money, or have been guilty of
abuses, said Mr. Milledge, the way is
open plain to bring them to account,
and he (hould not think, that any member
of the legislature, knowing of such abuses,
who did not bring them before the public
tribunal, did his duty : He concluded by
faying, that as a defender of the rights of
his conitituents, by affording them aU
tÂ£g m the- of "the go
vernment, he should vote againlt the mo
lion.
Mr. Findley. Sir, how far tlie
army is to be reduced,being a blank
in the motion before you, does not
come directly under debate, and
the re is a difference of opinion a
mong the gentlemen who i'uppoi't
the resolution ; the gentleman who
moved it, exprefled a design of re
ducing it to two regiments, and a
gentleman from New-Jersey (Mr.
Clark) proposes to reduee then) to
three, or to difcliarge none actually
enlisted â , at any rate the principle
is open to debate.
J he difcuflions with refpedl to the
expenditure of the revenue, and
the comparative merits of the regu
lar forces and the militia, have been
nifficiently difcuiled â , nt lfÂ»0 Â«s tar
asnhey relate to the quellion under
conftderation, therefore 1 fliall pass
those fubjeifts at this time with only
one remark.
From the oblervarious of the gen
tleman who moved the refo)ution,t> e
firft and great objetft is, by disband
ing a great proportion of the ariny,
I o obtain money for the redemption,
of the redeemable part of the pub
lic debt. 1 agree with him that this
is an important and desirable ohjetft,
but we differ in thisâthat 1 take it
to be a secondary object. I consider
the defence of the union to be supe
rior to every other consideration ; it
was the firft realon for forming the
government, and claims the firlt pi o
vifion aud earlielt attention from
those who govern.
However, the arguments which
have been deduced from the origin,
the management and inisfortunet of
the war claim my partioular atten
tion. ] hat the war exifled previ
ous to theprefent government is no
more denied ; thai it was the off
spring and remains of the war with
Britain is confirmed by fads which
will lung be had in melancholy re
membrance : but iince the com
mencement, it mult be acknowledg
ed that the war has changed its com
plexion, the carnage and depredati
on have been much extended, and
the reientment and union of the sa
vages greatly increased. Mow that
has happened is a proper fubjecl of
enquiry. Gentlemen in support of
the iefolution have pretty plainly
implicated the war department as
the source of these evils. Let it be
observed as one excellence of our
government, that all officers, civil
and military, are f'ubjert to legal
trial and punifhuieiu ; there is *no
officer so dignified in the United
States as to be out of the reach of
legal responsibility ; âand if, there
fore, there is delinquency, let it be
aliened boldly and examined to ef
fect. It is the members of the le
giHature only that are out of the
reach of trial and punilhincHt ; up
on these we have no hold, except

giflature that is oft he most

I do not appear as 1 lie :"N|vr>cate of
any other department, yet it is to
the conducts and neglects of the le
giflai lire that J now call the attenti
on of the coin mil tee ; it is from that
quarter that we can dtaw the molt
ufeful cautions for our deciiion of
this queition, and our future con
duct ; and it is more generous for
ns to examine and improve upon our
own faults in the firft instance. I
haxe already observed that the new
Congieft found the uniun in a state
of war.
What exertions were made to pro
cure peace, or grant protection, is a
very iiatnrai enquiry, One regi
ment was employed by (he old
Congress to fgr.ard t!jfronsier ;
though this whs a force infuffieienc
for !he purpose, yet it i 3 to be con
sidered tlmt the then government
had not the command of revenue,
and the individual States had com
petent powers,and the command of
their own revenue ; the enemy was
not combined, nor so much df the
frontier diltrerted. But did this
most pre/ling object obtain the ear
liest attention of Congress, or the
fii A provision ? No it did not. An
ill defined law was enai'ted,empow.
ering the President to call out the
militia, before any militia law of
Congress existed ; the conftquence
was that though they could not be
compelled, yet a number of thole
who were called upon went to the
Miami villages with General Har
niar ; with thole and his own regi
ment, tie arrived at, and dell toyed
those villages, and if he had had but
two regiments of good permanent
troops with the aliiltance of a few
chosen militia, he could have secu
red a lodgment there, notwithdand
ing the misforttines of his fkirinifli
ing parties ; and peace would have
been the prqbable confeqtience ;
but as the rime of fei vice of the mi
litia had cxpited, if he had been
ever so fortunate he mult have re
treated as he did ; thus the sava
ges were ex;reinely irritated, the
lignal given for union, and a great
extent of frontier formerly in sup
posed security became the object of
more than a common degree of sa
vage vengeance. In this diftrefling
(ituation of our affairs, the next Itep
taken by Congress was to enact a
law for railing a second regiment,
and to enlist levies for fix months
at two dollars a month, andjcloath
ing designed for to last half the
year ; just fufficient to take them
to the wilderness, there to starve
with cold in the molt inclement sea
son of they ear. The fatal catastro
phe in which this campaign ended
need not beiepeated, there is no
danger of its being forgot ; that ic
has encrealed the union and cou
rage of the Indian;), and encoura
ged them to treat with the most in
dignant insolence our overtures of
peace, is evident front the fate of
the brave men who fell with the
flags i for whose families we have
been jult making provision. Per
haps it may be said, as has at least
been reported, that Congress 011)3'
enacted into laws the plans recom
mended by the war department ;
how true this is in all the instances
to which I have alluded I know rot ;
but at any rate it is no apology. We
have no right to calt our legislative
responsibility upon the Executive
departmentâthis power for which
our character is exclufivrly refpon
fi'ole,cannot be transferred without
a breach of trufl. And for liielir
objects there was no other iitforma
tion necefl'ary but what was pofc
feffed by the lloufe. Congress knew
Â»knew ttait the wages were not a fuftcient en
couragement to procure Â£t men, they knew
it bore no reasonable proportion to the P rl "
of labor, at ieaft where the men were expect
ed; they knew that the time wai too short
for enlisting the men with such fconty encou
ragement, av.d for carrying on_ so di'.tant and
precariou an expedition, even ii no acci
dents or utifmaiiageineni were to take place ;
but cerrairfly accidents and mifmanapement
ought to be provided for in undertakings of
this nature; they know or might have known
that trifling with luch a war would naturally
excite the flame, and not quench it-
It cannot be pretended that resources were
wanting. Congreft received the public purie
with the government, and they very properly
foou rendered it productive. At an early pe
riod revenue* were found ; not only to pro
vide for the debts of the Union, for the dis
charge of which'they were bound by contract,
but alio made provision for the debts of the
individual .<tate% to do which thev were
bound bv 110 contraa ; and which are not yet
liquidated, nor their amount known. 1 can
not suppose this neg'ea was altogether owing
to inattention, for committees weru frequent
ly held on the state of the Union, and surely
the defence of the union was the firft subjeCt
which could present itfelf to their thoughts.
As no fufficient reason for this neglect has
ever occurred tome, 1 continue to view it
with surprize, perhaps others can better, ac
count for it. .
However, last session we were fufficiently
convinced of our error, the objeCt was fully
before us, as well as the plan proposed to be
pursued, and however we regretted the ex
pence, and evils Hill more to be dreaded,
from a {landing army, we from conviction,
provided adequate means, and now after
much of the expence is incurred, and the end
not accomplished, there is an attempt to with
draw the means : surely gertlemen have not
taken a full view of the fubjeCt.
Arguments have been drawn in favor of
the resolution from the flow progress ol t! e
recruiting service, and the inactivity of the
army last summer. On this subjeCt, I have a
verv different opinion. Let gentlemen for a
moment reflect upon the difficulties the re
cruiting service had to encounter. Ihe le
vies after a scene of arduous fatigue, endu
ring hunger and nakedness, many of them
were left rotting on the desolate sod in the
wilderness, and those who survived the horrid
carnage, returned with infinite hardships to
their homes, they with difficulty procured the
pittance allowed them by law ; their mouths
were filled with complaints, nor did they
alone complain ; and though the wages were
raised a dollar a month, yet even so, it was
not a fufficient encouragement where the
greatest number, and the best men were fought
for ; but this house are not to blame for this,
for we had agreed once, and again to Blake
the wages higher, but were overruled by the
other legislative branch. When gentlemen
maturely refleCt on those considerations, and
also that the spring was fat advanced, before
the recruiting service could commence, they
will with me rather be surprized that it has
succeeded so well; it is indeed beyond my most
sanguine expectations, and the men are not
generally of the most inferior kind, as has
been suggested.
With refpeft to the inactivity of the army,
the observations may have 111 some degree
arose from something expressed by me some
davs ago, I think on another subject.
X then said that the army which rendez
voused at Pitcfburgh had not undertaken the
defence of the frontier, and prevented the ne
cessity of militia service. That some of the
counties had been more diftretled by the ra
vages last summer, and the militia service
moÂ°re burthenfome than at any time since the
peace with Britainâthat even the county
Where thev lav had to employ militia ; and
this is certainly true ; of the reasons for this
X have not been informed, nor am I accounta
ble for it. However, it is but reasonable that
I should offer such reasons as fuigeft them
fclves to me. It is well known in this house
that General Butler's having, according to
orders, Tent such of the levies as arrived ear
lv to the frontiers, and therefore afforded
n'eceJTary protection in time of harvest, was
much complained of, and assigned as a cause
of defeat, not only by delay, but want of dis
cipline, though I do not think it had that ef
fe<st ; yet probably to prevent complaints oi
this nature, the introducing discipline and m\-
litarv habits among the new raised troops may
have been judged preferable to the defence of
t'ie frontier ; prevailing desertions might
have had its weight; but though this might
be complained of with relped to thole op
prefTed with savage depredations and militia
service, yet certainly the army may be more
fit for the great objeCt of an expedition, Ctc.
From mv own observations I know that un
remitting industry has been used to promote
discipline among the troops.
But an argument of another natuie, and
which seems to have tlie greatest weight with
the gentlemen, has been often urged, I mean
the expence, and the danger of new taxes.
I, it poflible that we have not revenues fuf
ficient for the defence of the union > Suielv
everv other clami inuft g've way to this.
Let it not be said that a tax for onr own de
fence could not be levied ; the people would
cheerfully pay taxes for this purpole, though
they mi"ht think themselves opprefled by o
ther demands that are more amply provided .
for But a new tax is not necelfary for that
purpose: a surplus of exiftiug revenues are at
our d-fpofal, befidss the cftimates of the war.
It is true we designed to have availed our
s-lves of it to begin the extuiguifhinent of
o" ir debt, though we have been since told that
it is necefTary to be applied otherwise, and
we arc called upon to raise a new tax for t .at
purpose, not for the purpose of procuring
Lace. However anxiously I desire to pay oft
the debt, yet I am certain it would be an
unwarrantable policy to fubjeft the country
to deftructiun lor that purpose ; beiides, 1
believe the alternative proposed would even
tually encreafe the expenee.
We liave a particular plan in view in order
to accomplish peace, .3 that plan executed .
Is t.iat object obtained ?
I believe gentlemen know we cannot ex
plain fully on this fubjetf, as it involves con
fidential communications, and plans not lu.
mitted to puolic view ; but they ay that two
regiments are fufficient to garrison the exilt
ing forts. Surely they know that to. t Ham
ilton, Fort Knox", See. are not the objeas con
templated; nor would these 1 prelume be
kept for their own fakes, they cannot defend
our territory, nor make it tbe interest ot the
Indians to Ik at pe<ice. If we expert to ex
ist as a nation we mult defend the territory
which we have purchased, which we have
fold to othei s, and which uniortunatley Â«<)r
them we have encouraged others to fettle
upon. In this I prefmne the committee are
agreed, at least I hope so ; but it will be laid
the difference is about the means. We are
told that the militia are more fit for this kind
of war than an army ; let the army keep the
forts, and the militia defend the frontiers
where they reside, and carry on expeditions
against the Indians. Comparing the militia
and Handing army is to little purpose ; I have
known both the one and the other on fomeoc
cafions behave so as to deserve great c() j n ~
mendation, &: at other times behave very 1 . J
this depends greatly 011 circumstances, eac jJ
have their particular advantages, and each
iliay find too much employ ; there are situa
tions and circumstances in which the nulitia
are undoubtedly best, and there are other fix
ations in which a Handing have the ad
vantage. But when I lpeak ot militia Ido
not mean such as are called in classes Â» r " m
their families, and composed ot many that
have neither been accustomed to the wood",
nor arms, ar.d go out with reluctance, leav
ing all that is dear to them behind, and con
sidering the service as a grievous eppreffiou.
I know and feel these things- I have been
oftenerthan once outwith the militia. 1 mean
a fele<stion of the militia willing to go, and
experienced in the woods, and in molt of
the frontiers such men, or suitable arms do
not now abound; but surely for services of a
more permanent nature an inlifted army is
more suitable.
But do gentlemen consider the consequenc
es of throwing all internal defence, ar.d dil
tant expeditions, upon the militia ? Is it not
enough that they already stand as a piquet
guard to their brethren who live at ease ;
that they eat their bread in the fear of their
lives, and are frequently embittered with
the view of mournful incidents ; but that we
must lay a deliberate plan for encreafing the
number of their fatherlels children, and chlld
lefs parents â 
I recollefl, it has been said oftener than
once on this floor on former occalions, and is
still owned by members, that the states who
have frontiers ought to provide for their own
protection, and that the government of the
union ought to assist only in the last resort; in
(bort that protection ought not to be a com
mon cause. Such highly aotifederal senti
ments I cor.fefs I heard with surprise.
There a.e some members, however, more
jV'nerous and proraife to vote for a iulHcient
fumof money to pay the expense. I believe
these members are sincere ; but do gentlemen
contemplate to what iflue the principles would
lead ? Do they not observe that the fate of
the government is deeply involved in the de
cision ?âPerhaps I may be alked, did not the
ltates depend chiefly uppn their own exerti
ons for the defence of the frontiers m.der the |
old Congress i Yes, they did, and were better j
protected than since that period. But let it
be recollected that at that time the llates had
the command of their own resources, and the
laying and executing their own plans : that
tbe Indians were not so formidably
but that since, the states had not the power ot
retaliating, nor the means of gratifying with
presents, since the Indians have been solemn.
ly told to look away from the little fires of
the states, to the great fire of the union : they
have looked upon us a more formidable and
dangerous foe, and made their arrangements
accordingly, and European nations and emis
saries among them have improved upon the
circumstance, and excited and aided them in
their union and exertions.
If the militia are to be so much oppreflbd,
it must be under their state laws; the operati
on of our militia law has not been tried, and
the militia will naturally have more confi
dence in the laws of the state, ar.d be better
paid by them. If the people must undergo all
the risk of life and all the hardihips of war, in
carrying on a war which they did not coin
mence, nor have power to terminate, will
they not natui ally look from the government
of the union, to that of their own states ! and
will the state governments conduct a war with
their hands tied ? Will they not take theii
own way of conducting the war and of pro
curing peace i Surely they will, and the ge
neral government ought only to hope for obe
dience* and respect as long as it gives general
protection, which was the reason of its inflitu
tion. But if gentlemen were willing thus to
surrender the principles of the government,
they ought firft to put the frontier states in
as good a situation as the new Congress found
them ; when the Indians were not united, and
when they did not know that they could so
easily and compleatly defaat us.
Supposing that we appropriate a fufficient
sum of money to pay the frontier militia for
conducting the war of the union ; I ask who
are these militia ? is it those unfortunate few
whom we induced ho fettle at Marietta that
are to protect our extensive western territo
ry, against the united exertions ot all the west
ern Indians ? or is it the few scattered inha-

r "round to confide in the

dwelt upon by all the gentlemen-
Arguments however of another and more
important nature have been suggested in fa

Ho., whether we (hall begin a war or whe
ther we ihall have a standing army to aid the
foment in time of peace ; Â« that were
the cafe I would certainly be on the other fide,
but with us it is a question of nerftv n
nf choice, it is to procure a peace, and not to
procure a war; it is to protect, , t0
oppress or aid in govern,ng our citizens , I
know that standing armies have always been
sources of oppression and aids of tyranny; our
people may long be governed without such
aid s their situation will not admit oi abu.es
from standing armies, nor would the citizens
submit thereto. f
However when I observe the difficulty of
procuring money for the /upport of even a
neceflarv force, and the jealousy ot armies
so prevalent among the members; whatever
difficulties it may now produce, yet thr. ti. -
nofition augurs well towards the fecuitty ot
our liberties; when I also conf.der how anxi
ous the people rfthe United States and the
members of Coigrefs are for peace, and what
extraordinary exertions the executive has
made to preserve it; and when I also refLft,
that the next Congress will be a more full
and equal repre entation of the pecple s
efts and sentiments than we are, I am conii
dent the army will be discharged ss soon as
our afFairs'will admit of it. _
The profpefts we have ol peace are not ve
ry flattering, they by no means arise from the
good dispositions of the Indians towards us,
nor from the love of peace,but from thedread
of the power and permanency ol our force ;
take away those impressions and all our proi
pefts of peace vanifli; it may be reco.lefted
that the Six Nation Indians were our invete
rate foe-:, and would never listen to the voice
of peace until they felt our power, and we
have fufficient proofs, that their continuing
peaceable does not arise from their dispositi
ons towards us, but from their being so much
in reach of our power. Admitting that the
militia were in refpeft the best for fight
ing Indians,and thatwe could in justice throw
the burthen and risk of fighting wholly on
them ; yet this method would certainly length
en the war ; we have, and always had the
militia ; but they are not a visible force, the
strokes they make distress and irritate the
Indians, and when the expedition is over the
force disappears, and the Indians meditate
and too often obtain revenge ; the apprehen
sion of an army strikes them with apprehensi
ons of a permanent design, and convinces
them that it is their interest to have peace ;
the late murders of those who bore the en
signs of peace are an undoubted proof that the
profpefts of peace do not arise from any other
! motives than the dread of our force.
When I reflefton our having so lately been
convinced of the indifpenfible necessity ofraif
ing an army, and before it was poflible to ac
complish the object intended, that a motion is
made for leflening that force, I am truly sur
prised at the inconsistency to which it would
lead ; surely there is not such an instance to
be found in the history of nations, nor in the
acts of public bodies, and if it Ihould succeed
it would mark our councils in an extraordi
nary point of view. Howeve, so averse am I
to armies and so sensible of the evils they have
occasioned, that I gave a I'erious ear to the
motion, and maturely examined the circum
stances in which the cafe was involved. I
wilhed for reasons tojuitify my fapporting
thereof, but examination produced convicti
on of its impropriety.
The gentlemen doubtless have determined
from thefirft imprellion of the fubjeft ; more
minute investigation will convince themselves
of the bad policy of such an unrealonable
change of measures. I with great reluctance
was convinced of the necellitv of so great a
force last session, but even if I had been final
ly against it last feilion, I would nevertheless
have been for supporting that force in the pre
sent important crisis ; better by far we had
never made the law for raising the army than
to repeal it now.
The present Indian war is eifentially dif
ferent from any former one. When Britain
and France divided North America betwixt
them, if the emmiffaries of both excited thp
Indians to war, the power of both afforded
protection. When Britain became pofl'efled
of the Western posts, and many tribes of In
dians commenced a war, the British govern
ment conducted the war, tarried it into the
Indian country, and by the dread of their
arms procured a peace ; but the Indians were
not thenfupported by other powers. But in
the preieut war, the Indians who at that time
knew nothing of us, have combined to make
it a common cause ; and no superior power
interest tJierafeives in our favor, no, they
conÂ«<v? oSr inftrefti toK: inimical totheirt,
But if they d;d not receive encouragement,
protection, and supplies from our European
neighbors a peace wou!d soon he procured,
the gentlemen who lupport this resolution
know well how that matter (lands, and tlwy
know explanations here are not convenient.
I once thought of nuving a retaliation lor
limiting the time of enlisting to feme day in
March or April next, knowing that tlie inter,
mediate winter months are the bed season
for recrjuiting, and apprehending the best op.
portunities of disciplining would then be pro
bably over J Wut upon second thought, I ap
prehend this was not necelfary, that nioit pro
bably the army by that time would l>e so near
ly compleat, that ali the fuvsng of money it
would make, would be no object, and reflect
ing that the President was already authori'ed
either to stop recruit ng, or to d;ich.trge the
new regiments wben circumstance* would ad'
mitof Inch a inea ure. From the observa
tions I have made the committee will lie con
vinced that 1 deiign to vote agaiuft the re.
solution. (D'tal' be confirmed.)

ABSTRACT OF FURTHER ACCOUNTS
BY THE PACKET.
THE fucceflfcs of France were celebrated at
Sheffield, and othei paits of England, Scotland
and Ireland, by bonfires, ringing of bells, firing
of cannon, &c. &c.âA treaty was concluded
the ill November between 'he French republic
and that of Geneva.âThe Court ot Vienna, it
is kid, has promise) to redrtfs all the grievances
ot Brabant.âAmong the toads drank by the
Belraft valuntecrs, Ireland, was the followingâ
4< The aujpicioui day on which the French Na
tional Convention decreed that Royalty was abo
fijhed."âln the French account ot the retieat of
the Dukt of Brunfwick, they state, lhat the day
pÂ»eced ing the retreat, a council of war wasfom
nioned. In opinion ihc Duke of Brunfwick
flood alone. All the officers declared, that a
more favorable opportunity for overthrowing
Dumourier could not occur, and that he ought
infhntly to be attacked. The Duke continued
to enforce the declaration which he had advan
ced, not by rational argument, but by the peevv
ifh pertinacity of a commander enamoured of
his own judgment. The other officers became
indignant, and even tumultuous. From mur
murs and gentle remonstrances they proceeded
to audacious assertions, the tendency ot which
rather provoked than soothed or convinced the
Commander. Clairfayt offered '.o commence
the attack, and to receive the firft (hock of the
enfeebled enemy, at the head of the Auftrians ;
and Maiechal Broglio, supported by the French
Princes, insisted, that as it was the cause of the
Emigrants, he and his followers confidercd it a
duty incumbent upon them to run the ha2ard
expected from the fiift onset. This corps con
fiftrd of xo,ooo, formerly officers and gentlemen
ot France, proud of their late diftinftions in so
ciety, impatient tor the confli& to display their
prowess, and impelled to aflion by every mo
tive ot revenge. The Duke of Brunfwick not
only refufed to listen to the admonitions now
eagerly urged, but threatened to punish the offi
cers for disobedience.
The King of Piuffn has undertaken to furnifh
every Emigrant, to Ihe number of Boco, with
rations of biead daily, and 15 livrei a month.â
Coblentz is garri foiled with 6Â®oo men, part
Prufluns. Apprctf , nfmns prevail of an infur
rect'.on in Turin, the capital of Sardinia.âThe
Pat is accounts ltate that the Emigrants are cry
ing pcccavi, jnd are petitioning for leave to re
turn.
The Pope, apprehenfi*e of a visit from a
French fleet is putting Civita Vacchia into a pos
ture of defence.âThe King of Sardinia has
wrote to the 13 Cantons, and the allies of the
Helvetic Body,on account of the invasion of Sa
voy ; but received for answer, that the Helvetic
Body would fcrupulouflv adhere to their neutra
lity âM. Dumourier, in a letter to the National
Convention, fay*, " The more fuccelfes I obtain
againtt the enemies*of Liberty, the tnore do my
internal enemies eocreafe This letter refers to
one to the Mintrter of War, in which he announ
ces his wish and determination to retire from
public life at the end of the war. " I defne

Convention of Savoy has decrecd the eccleliafti
cal propeity, national properly, the abolition ot
convents, and the fequcllranon ot the erFecls of
Emigrants.âA Spanish vessel loaded with grain,
defined for the King of Saidinia, was made
a prize of by the French in the port of Ville
Franche.âDublin was illuminated o" account
of the fuccefles of the F.ench.âThe citizens of
Mente have petitioned to be annexed to trance.
Citizen Pache ha* fucteeded Le Brun as Mintfter
at War.âA new and more severe decree ha<
palled against the Emigrants : they are ban.ibed
forever from the French territory ; they ar: civi
c&'ly Htjunfi, and their goods fequeftercd to ihe
State.-a-Gen. Biron has placed himfclf under
the Â©rders of Gen. Cuftine.âSebaftian Huet has

of the t>,ial of the King. â' Tour nay is taken by
the F.ench.âThe citizens of N'aniur have le
volted Irpni Aultria.âThe French armies in the
Low Countries amount to 140,000 men.
On the 6th November the French army, con.
fjfting of 40,000 men, attacked the Auftriari,
amounting to 28,000. The battle began at 8
o'clock in the morning, and continued till 4 in
the afternoon, when vi&ory declared in favor of
the French. The Auftrians were totally routed,
a!! their irHrenchments forced at the point of the
bayonet, and a number of their cannon taken :
they wcrs strongly ported on the Heights of
Genneppe, in the neghbourhood of Mons.
Three tiers of redoubts rose one above another
like an amphitheatre ; these were filled with
cannon ; but the French carried then} one after
another, to use the words of Gen. Dumourier,
with infinite vivacity. The Ftench loss iscfti
matcd at about 300 killed, and 600 wounded ;
that of the Auftrians at 600 killed ; their whole j
loss in killed, wounded, prifonets and deserters,
at 4000. The city of Mons opened its gates to
the. conquerors, and wherever the French appear,
tftey'afe cordially received. Lieut. Gen. Eg*-
lite, son of the ci-devant Duke of Orleans, is
mentioned in the highest terms of applause for
his bravery and intrepidity in the above battle.
The arms of France have overrun all the Aus
trian Netherlands; Bruflels, the capital, being in
their hands; the general opinion appears to be,
that there is an end to the authoi ity of the House
of Auftiia over that country.
M. Scrvan is to command an army destined
to a& against Spain in the Spring. Kellerman
takes the command of the Alpine at my, in the

There is avery general report(faysaLondon

NOVEMBER 22.
Extraordinary Sitting âTkurfday Night.
Letter from Gen. Dumouriir.
BruJJels, Nov. 14.
Citizen President,
1 yellerday presented rnyfelf before Brufiels
with my advanced guard. The Auftrians dif
puled with mc the heights of Andcrfecht. I
was unwilling to expose my brave comrades to
Ihed blood in vain ; night came on ; I kept my
troops under arms ; and, in the morning, I was
ralli ed at Brussels as the deliverer of the nation! â
The Citizen Mintfler at War'will lav before you
the conqife details which I have sent to him.â
The army of the Republic is more animated
than ever ; it may receive for motto, " Viics
acquirU cundo."
(Signed) Dumourier.
General in Chef of the Army 111 the Austrian
Netherlands.
By letters from Cape-Francois, and by pa
pers from that quarter, we learn, that on the
2 J and 3d of December there were dilturban
bances in that unfortunate place.âThe want
of a cordial union between the whites ard the
free people of colour appears to have been the
cause, the shedding of more blood, the effert.
The consequences had like to have been very
serious; the negroes made an attack upon the
Cape daring the disturbance, and were nearly
fuctefsful.
It appears tbat the military service which
tliÂ« colony requires, is not performed with
very great ardour on the part of the citizens.
All was aÂ»ain quiet 011 the sth, and our pa
pers to the 7th made no mention of an inter
ruption of tranquility.
We are informed, that the inhabitants of
the of Martinico and Guadaloupe,
have lately captured, by an armed force, the
iHands of* St. Lucia and Marigalante, two
French islands. It is iVic!, the two former
colonies have renounced the jurifdidlion of
France, and have eltabli'hcd tiicmielv.es as an
independent Urate.
The Montgomery, Capt.Bnnyan, is arrived
at New-York. Mr. Wigne] and Company are
not paflengers in this velTel.
The fuccefTes of the French armies were
celebrated at New-Brunfwick, by a public
dinner, on the lit of January.
We hear that on the firft instant a begin
ning was made ofthe State Canal, at the Ca
nowago fails, of which the celebrated Mr.
Brindleyhas at present the direction. On
new.years day 17 rocks were blown, one for
each gentleman of the Canal Company : The
quality of the stones are such as eofrty admit
blowing, which render it a matter of more
consequence to the holders of fliares."
It is reported that Mr. Pitt, the Britifli
prime Mini Her has refigtied.
Extrad of a letter from New-York.
" The Packct brings an account of a proba
ble revolution in Ireland ; 80,000 men are al
ready raised for the purpefe."
Mr. Blanchard, agreeably to his adver*
tifement, at five minutes pad ten o'clock la ft
Wednesday morning, rose with his Balloon from
the PriTon Court in this city, in presence of an
immense concourse of fpe&ators, affemblcd on
the occasion. The process of inflating the bal
loon commenced abont nine o'clock. Seveial
cannon were fired from the dawn of day until
the moment of elevation ; a band of music play
ed during the time of inflating, and when it be.
gan to rife, the majestic fight was truly interest
ingâthe flow movement of the band, added fo
il mnity to the scene. Indeed the attention of
the multitude was so absorbed, that it was a con
siderable time ere filcnce was broke by the ac
clamations which fitcceeded.
Aj foou as the clock had struck ten, every
thing being ready, Mr. Blanchard took a ic
fpe&ful leave of all the fpefctators, and received
from the hands of the President a paper, at the
fame time the President spoke a few words to
this bold adventurer, who immediately leaped
