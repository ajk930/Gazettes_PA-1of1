SAMUEL M'DOWELL, P. <
Attest. Thomas Todd, c. c.
FROM THE CONNECTICUT JOURNAL
Mess. Printers,
By ivjertrng the jell owing obferyations in xour vjeful
Journal, you will one of \our o'd cvjlowers,
and do an cjjentialJertjce to the public.
Notwithstanding the many and fre
quent cautions given the public, with re
fpedt to the dangerous nature of copper ; I
have rarely oblerved any precautions given
concerning the poifonoqs nature of lead, which
is to be avoided more cautiouily, as its poison
ihough perhaps flower in its efibdfcs, may yet
prove as fatal, or even more certainly so than
that from the copper.
Lead enters various compositions, and form-:
many of the utenflls in common uie ; and in
this country the health of its inhabitants is
much more exposed from the deleterious quali
ty of the lead, than from that of copper.
Afmall quantity of lead received into the ha
bit, is capable of producing lpafms and convut
fions, tremors and pallies, it interrupts the ie
cretions, retards circulation, and injures the
nerves.
So virulent is the poison of this metal, that
it is said that where the ore is wa(hed and imelt-
Ed, it proves fatal to dog"., cats, and fowl:,
which are kept near the worksâevery kind of
beast feeding upon the grass over which the
(team of the fmeltingore partes, live but a short
time.âThe workmen and thole who dig the
ore, are (hort lived, and molt commonly die
paralyticâthose who work the oxyd or calx ot
this mineral are lo lubjeft to the colic, that the
disease is known by the name of the painter's
colic.
Tiie potter also who is familiar with the pre
parations of lead in his glazings, rarely fails of
carrying vilible marks of it in his countenar.ce,
and of the complaints of it? deleterious c rfedts.
Only three grains of lead to the gallon of
new rum which a regiment of soldiers made
free use of, produced a molt terrible complaint
of the colic, of which a greater part were down
at the fame time.*
Some by a practice of fitting with their feet
on ftiset lead, which was before the lire,
have been aflfe&ed with the palsy in the legs.
Preparations of lead in oil, and other loluti
ons of lead applied to large lurfaces denudated,
or even to so fniall a part as the nipples, when
excoriated, have been known to produce acute
pains at the ftomac'i, colic, loss of appetite, fla
tulence and deprelfion in the nurse, and in the
child put to fuck, (without proper precaution)
violent gripes, andeven convulsions; but more
frequently are these effects by the use
of the sugar or fait of lead, for the cure of thrush
or fore mouths in infants.
Many have experienced pernicious effe&s
from only working on oil cloths made with dry
ing oil, prepared with lead. And I have re
peatedly known fatal effects produced by lodg
ing in a confined room, newly painted with lead
en pigments.
Printers have Tome times become paralytic
bv handling their types, which consist of" a porti
on oflcad.
The vintners or wine fellers, in order to ren
der their harsh wines vendible have recouvfe to
a horrid diabolical practice, and /requentiy (oft
en and sweeten them with some preparation of
lead ; so ftroug is their passion for
they are loft to all the feelings of humanity, and
prepare a fatal poison, of which there can be no
miftrufl in thr>lc who arc to endure the fatal cf
fe&s.
If the observations on the nature of lead up
on the human constitution are well founded,
(which I believe cannot be confuted as they de
pend on fa<sts ;) âthen it concerns every indivi
dual to take the caution, as all perhaps arc
leiVconverfant with some or other of
I the saturnine preparations, many of them un
| thought of and never fufpecled. I write unto
I you nurses, that; while you are cpnfulting theiliverfion andamufementofyour little innocent:,
you may not introduce a fatal poilon into their
habits, by putting some painted poilonons toy
into their hands, which have some lead or othei
poisonous paint upon them and only covered
with a flight varnish, which is soon rubbed and
walhed off in their mouth?, and lb much poison
introduced into their habits, as to become a
source of a long train of evils if not eventually
fatal.
I writ? unto you honest retailers, tobe atten
tive and ever jealous of your pewter meal'ures,
many of which have a great fliare of lead in
their coinpolition, and if acid liquors are per
mitted to remain any time in tlicm they will
be ttrongly impregnated with thepoifonous salts
of this mineral, and rendered extremely dange
rous to thole who drink the liquors.
1 write unto you cooks, that you be careful
of your pewter vessels or copper tinned there
with, that you do not fuffer your (harp or poig
nant fauces tobe prepared or ftandin tliofe vel
fels.
I write unto you pve and pastry makers that
you not only disuse pewter but that you be a
ware of your common courser earthen, whole
glazing is oflead and easily corroded.
J jrrite unto you painters, that ye bo cauti
ous of the poison, on the ufc of which your sub
sistence so much depend l ;, that you abstain from
that too eommwi practice (from a mistaken
idea) of taking by way of antidote, a double al
lowance of spirituous liquors ; for one devil is
not call out by another, else is satan's kingdom
divided.
Therefore be admonished while working your
lead to use spirits fpa'ringly if at all, and instead
of your ufnal nips, take half a jill of sweet oi!,
which will be found a great preservative to
health.
Now I write unto you limners, and thole who
use the pewter paints, that ye may take the a
bove precautions, and in particular that while
you are studying your devices, you do not hold
your pencil in your mouths, nor as it is too cul
toinary to clean it with your mouths.
I write unto you whohave devoted yourselves
martyrs, to Sir Richard, that ye may look well
to it, that old Saturn by an untimely stroke of
his sharp scythe, does not rob Sir Richard of his
facrifice.
To you bacchanalians, that the god you serve
may not be diflionored, nor robbed of the glory
which would be shortly due to him wore it not
for the interposition of this rapacious mineral.
Lastly, I write unto you vintners, wine fel
lers, who make use of this poison to disguise
the acid of your wine, that you may consider
the justice of your damnation, how inevitable !
how aggravated ! for it fwiftly comes from
that Hand,which is termed the avenger of blood,
and lingereth not. ANTI-SATURNUS.
* It has been observed that the colic has been lejs
Jrequent in this country Jince the introduction of earthen
instead of pecuter plates ; but perhaps the introduction
of iron tea kettles, inflcad of the copper, lined with
pewter, may be confidcred as jilutary a change in this
refped.

AN EXTRACT'
Mr. Freneau,
" A S a fubferiber and well-wisher
-1 V. to the National Gazette, I take
the liberty of advifmgyou against em
ploying much of your paper in re
plying to the court paragraphs, which
appear in the Gazette of the United
States. There needs no second Daniel
to interpret for that paper. A para
graph in favor of the excise can easily
be traced to a gentleman who holds
a poll under that virtuous system in
Baltimore. The eulogiums on the
fame fy(tein,in the Pittsburgh Gazette,
bespeak their author in every line ;
the eflays in favor of perpetual debt
flow from the brokers and their
friendsâthe difguftful adulatory in
a nfe is applied to the adminjlration,
not to the constitution ; for these are
different things, as times go."
Tor the GAZETTE of the UNITED STATES.
MR. FENNO,
IT has long been the opinion of
many peifons, friends to liberty and
the equal rights of election and re
presentation that the National
Gazette so called, is a paper efta
blifhecl by a junto for electioneering
purposesâand to subvert those fyf
terns, which though in their infancy,
l>a\e tranquilizer! this country, and
produced a moil aftonifliing change
in iis profpecfts and situation.
The National Gazette of the 4th
instantâa day that ought to be sacred
to union, harmony and pleasure, ap
pears to juftify the observation, 'bat
benefits conferred on fonie minds
ttreiijgtlien their obduracy,
" A> sol's blest beams turn vinegar more four.',
I have read the fevera] columns of
that paper and cannot find one idea
honorary to the people of the United
States, favorable to its government,
or to the persons adminiflering the
lame : On the other hand between
five and fix columns are filled with
abuse of the government ; while the
people are reprefemcd as the weak
lieedlefs dupes of a few, who have
tricked them ouc of ,their property
and liberties by purfuading them to
adopt the conllitution of the United
States.âAll this however is but a dust
railed to cover tbe advance of the
main de/ign, which is nothing less
than to oitj/ from the government al
most every man now in the adminis
tration.â 1 have attempted a dilfecftion
of the principal parts of this extraor
dinary publication of the 4th Julyâ
and it is at your service :
WHEIIEAS the government of the
United States in the firjl dawn, of its
exillence, fay the writers in the Na
tional Gazette, has diverged from its
republican principles,and in uirnaidin
a<sts has explained away all the limi
tations of the conllitution r and " pre
cedents and phrases" have been
" fliufÃed in without being adverted
to by candid or weak people, the dit
ped part of tlie majority," though
anticipated and discerned by us, the
then dormant, but penetrating guar
d ians of libertyâAnd whereas " the
public niind in a heedlsfs and unfcttled
itate," (i.) while we were eichernot
in the country, or were otherways
bitter employed, " let the press" hold
up to view the advantages of peace,
liberty and fajety under the auspices
of a firm republican government, e
(tabliflied by the people theiufelves ;
without any attempts on our (2.) part
that were fuccefsful,to persuade ihem
that there was 110 neceflity for any
union, justice or harmony in theflates
âAnd whereas the debt incurred for
the general defence ought to have been
annihilated a: the ceilation of hoflili
ties and the declaration of peace ;
inflead of which, the government of
the United States, agreeable to the
constitution, but contrary to our nd
vice, opinion, or judgment in the
cafe, lias contumaciously, and in de
fiance of every principle of our creed,
funded said debt on terms advanta
geous to the holders thereof, and to
the government, bnt without one
farthing's immediate benefit to us, who
never owned a (hilling of it, and who
never did, or ever can, or will flake
a doit 011 the iflue of any contelk what
ever, for the public good And
whereas the Congress of the United
States, consisting of the Hotife of Re
presentatives, chosen by the people,
and the Senate, with the President of
the United States, chosen also by the
people, have parted '* an atfi making

CRITO.flagrant violation of your public l ight
when the free and fair fuffrages of

trary to the mild language of our
laws, which never convi<st upon'a less
evidence than is required to acquit
contrary to the given opinion of the
great and learned law characters of
the state, have your hone ft endeavors
for a favorite administration been

The seriousness of the 03th you

LANSINGBUR G.H, June 3;.
At ten o'clock this morning arrived here,
sttesded by an escort of refpe&able inhabitants
of this place, the hon. John Jay, esq. chief-juftice
of the United States. On this occasion
every citizen feeling a becoming zeal to express
his good wilhes to the man of their choice, ap
pointed a committee on their behalf, who wait
ed on his honor at Piatt's inn, andprefented him
the following address.
7*o John Jay, Esq. Chief Juflicc of the United States.
s 1 R,
W E beg leave to address you in the simple
style of freemen ; and in the name of the citi
zens of Lanfingburgh, to congratulate you on
your arrival in our infant settlement.
Fully impreifed with a sense of your paifi
otifm, we embrace this opportunity of exprelf
ing our gratitude for your unwearied exertions
through the struggles cf an opprefiive war, and
your eminent services as a fiatefman and mini
ster at home and abroad.
Our refpefl for your character in the digni
fied office of Chief-Jullice of the United States,
and our regard for your person as a man pof
fefling the confidence of the j>eople, give us the
jnoft lively hopes cf Ihortly embracing you as
the chief-magiftrate of this state. Nor can at e
refrain on this occasion from exprefling our fin- 1
cere regret and resentment at the prostitution
of thole principles of virtue, patriotism and du
ty which has been difpfayed by a majority of the
can vailing committee, in the wanton violation
of our most facrcd and inestimable privileges,
in arbitrarily disfranchiiing whole towns and
counties of their fuffrages.
It was, perhaps, little contemplated that the
constitution of thisftate, which you had so great
a share in framing, fliould, in the firft instance,
to your prejudice, be in so flagrant a manner
violate*.
However desirous we may be of feeing you j
fill the ollice of governor of this state, we only
v/ifli it from the free fuffrages of a majority of
the electors : &at majority you have, <Â»r>d tho'
abtife of power may for a time deprive you and
the citizens of their right, we trust the facrt <
flame oi liberty is not To far extinguished in
ho oms of Americans, as tamely to submit to
wear the lhackles of slavery, without, at least,
A flruggle to shake them off.
"With the highest re!pe<sl we are your devoted
friends and very humble servant",

To the Gentlemen ef the Committee,
GENTLEMEN,
PERMIT me to request the favor of you
to prcfent to my fellow citizens of Lanfing
burgh, my warm and sincere acknovledgments
lor the honor they have done me oa this occa
fion ; and to iflure you, gentlemen, that the j
manner in which you have conveyed their fervÂ»
timents, add to the fatisfaftion which they in
spire. Their approbation encreafes thepleafure
with which Iretieft on my endeavours ro serve
the cause of liberty and my country ; that cause
iii which their ardor and' their iirmneft have
been diftinguiihed.
The various bounties of heaven to the people
of this Hate have afforded them abundant reaton
for gratitude, harmony an A content; and every
event is to be regretted, that tends to introduce
Gireitinftanced as I am
â¢ord and complaint.
in relation to the one you mention, I find niv
felf retrained by coniideratlons of delicacy
from particular remarks. The citizens of the
state know tiie value of their rights ; and it is
to be expected, i swell as'fmcerely to be wilhed,
that their cltoi ts' to alfert and maintain them,
will on every occalion, be marked by temper
and moderation, as well as by constancy and
zeal.
In whatever flation or situation I maybe
placed, my attachment to my country will re
main unabated ; and I shall always be happy In
opportunities of my refpcdl and best wilhes for
the citizens of Lanlingbjirgh.

NEW-YORK, July 3.
Lalt Lord's day, between three and
four o'clock p.m. we were visited with
a severe (quail of wind, accompanied
with some rain.
Mr. Wade, ship-carpenter's, boat*
which contained hinifelf, wife, bro
ther, two children, and a young man,
were overset oppose to Yellow-Hook,
a few miles from the city, and all
were drowned except the young man,
who clung to the boat.
Also, another bnot, with three men
and two boys, was overset and all
drowned.
Also we learn that a sloop, contain
ing sixteen or eighteen person were
all drowned in consequence of this
tremendous gull.
Tis reported that several other
boats were overset, and persons loft,
the truth of which we cannot avouch.
Much damage has been done to hou
ses, orchards, &c.
It is indeed a melancholy reflection,
when we cotlfider the number of per
fotis drowned in taking their plea
furesi on the Sabbath. Every year,
since the peace commenced, produced
some awful warningof the like kind.
Boats are crowded with people going
to different quarters on that sacred
day, for their pleasures. May these
be a warning to irreligious triflers !
A stranger, viewing our ftrects, our
public walks, roads, boats, &c. near
the city, might be apt to interrogate,
Have they no magiflrate< in New-York ?

with every demonstration of joy due to the oc
casion, which gave freedom to a worldâCon
gratulations, becoming freemen governed by
eqnal laws, were exprefled with a cordiality,
which freemen only can feelâBells and cannon
but feebly proclaimed the sentiments of citizens,
who, conscious of the advantages which result
from political and religious liberty, revere the
return of that day, on which they emerged
from the horrors o'*fervitude to the blefTings of
independence. Among the offerings at the Al
tar of Freedom âwe beheld with lincere fatis
fa&ioa the homage paid by all orders of men to
the Military Defender, and Civil Guardian of
his country.
Congratulations were offered to the President
of the United States by the foreign Miniitersâ
the officers of the militia, and many refpe&able
citizens.
The Society of the Cincinnati, headed by
their President and Vice-President (the Gover

ed by M. de Rouvray and M. de Fontanges.
Preparations were making for a general at
tack on the revolted slaves.
M. de Blanchelande had visited the Weft cor- j
don, and had gone to St. Mare.
The Governor, by the proclamation above
mentioned, in strong language, calls upon the
white inhabitants, people of colour and free ne
groes to recollect, that certain information has
been received from France, that the Allembly
had paired a decree on their political state,
which decree was fandtionedby the King on the
sth of April. That the Colonial AJTembly hav
ing received a copy of it, through their com
millioners, had wifely exprelTed their refpedl
for it, and determined to abide by the decision.
He hopes that the people of colour and free ne
groes will equally rcfpedl the decision of the
mother country ; and urges them all to put a
(top to their divilions, and unite in the common
cause.
' The UniveiTity of Glafgoiv it is said has fub

doubt, occasionally fbme gigantic minds which,
applying to a particular itudv, outflnp their

in innate ideas* how can we expert that the

into it by fomeÂ«xtraneous circumstances which

The ESSAYEST.
" And catch the manners living or they Parr.
IT has often been remarked by travellers who
have visited this country, that the Americans
are lei's national than any other people ; which
observation is undoubtedly pretty generally true.
There feeins to be a natural propensity inalmolt
every human being to think more favorably of
himl'elf than of his neighbor ; of ascribing to
hiinfelf virtues and qualities the poffefiion of
which he is unwilling 10 allow to others ; and of
detracting from them excellencies in which he is
notoriouily deficient, and to which he can never
liopero aspire by any subsequent exertions. This
inclination ptedominates in the mind in propor
tion as thecaufes of it are more or less powerful,
more or less numerous. It reaches not only to
individuals and private societies, bin extends its
influence to States and nations. Thus we fre
quently fee a foreigner so strongly prejudiced in
favor of his country, from which perhaps he was
transported for crimes that are a disgrace to hu
manity, redden with anger at a supposed asper
sion againlt his countrymen, by whom he had
been treated with the greatefl contempt, which
he very justly merited. That the Americans are
exempt from national prejudice isfar from beiug
the truth. The inhabitants of altnofl every State
in America are diflinguifhed by fame particula
rities, either of speech Â®r behavior, peculiar to
themselves. The inoft apparent national dif
tintfions appear to exist between the natives of
the New-Engiana States and the inhabitants of
all the others, from their frequently (ligmatiz
ing each other with the faiirical appellations of
Cracker, Yankee, Lovers of Fork and Molafles,
bad Pronouncers of their own Tongue, and many
other such like elegant epithets. " Particular
instances ought not to juflify general conclu
sions." Therefore that behavior which charac
terizes a few in any State ought not to be indis
criminately attributed fa all, nor (lamp their
national character. To judge of a whole peo
ple by a tew individuals argues want of experi
ence, an unacquaintance with men and manners,
and a mind clouded with prejudice and absorbed
in ignorance. " There are good as well as bad
in all societies." If a parallel were drawn be
tween the northern and fourhern States, hy bal
ancing the advantages and disadvantages on both
fides with regard to the use of cant words and
'he fcaje might preponderate in favor
of .the former, tor there the greatefl attention is
paid to learning, which is conspicuous in the
number and diversity of excellent literary insti
tutions eltablifhed in every part.
The convet fation of many of mv fellow-citi
zens, at certain seasons especially, turns entirely
on the meetings and exploits (past, present, or
10 come) of the Sons of St. Patrick, St. Andrew,
-St; George. I could wish to observe to those
who have been born in countries under the flip,
posed patronage of any of the aforefaid Right
Worfliipful Personages, but have left them to
take their final residence in America, that it
would better become them to acknowledge their
new father St. Tapiniany, who is a father to them
by the fame rule that " a friend in need is a
friend indeed," and who is so far from the
ftrictneis of their former patrons that he lias ne
ver attempted to enforce any other rule than
that " every man fliall do as he pleases." But,
if there is any excuse for the natives of Europe
what are weto think of those who, as well as
their lathers and grandfathers before them
weie born in this country, and yet have searched
their pedigrees to find out which of the European
Saints they belong to ! There is Chriflopher
Bogherty, a pretty equal mixture of German and
Inlh, but perceiving that the Germans seldom
frolic for their Saint, and indeed hardly know
his name, he,in thedialeJt of his mother's family
(wears he will join the Sons of St. Patrick, for
he lias been drunk with them more as two times
ar:a '/\ A "', l m y "eiglihor Jonathan Gregor, def
ended on both fides from the fird fettle, s of
New-England, is determined to join the sons of
.St. Andrew , for, Â« Â«dds f watu p !t> as sure a]
J>ia.<es, it hiuft be tarnation clever fun-," though
the mixture in honed Jonathan's blood is such
as would puzzle a good jockey, with all his
knowledge of quarters, eighths, sixteenths. and
thiu>-feconds, to ascertain what proportion of
Â« is Scomfli. But enough-The countries of
Europe were all peopled by emigrants, and as
we are now a nation, let us not be alLamed of
