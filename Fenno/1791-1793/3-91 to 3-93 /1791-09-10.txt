AMERICAN MANUFACTURES
The following plan for eflabJipiing and promoting Manufactures upon
an extensive and competent scale, has received the approbation 0) many
of the citizens of the United States, as well as several refpeftable jo
reigneis. Subscriptions to a very confderable amount, as mentioned
in a former paper, have already been made--Preparations of various
kinds are in hand to carry the design into effett, so that there is every
? eafon to indulge the tncfl pleasing expiations from, a spirited pro
secution of the undertaking.
THE clldblifhment of ManufaClures iri the United States, when
maturely considered, will be found to be of the highest im
portance to their prosperity. It fecms an aim oft fell-evident pro
portion, that comuiunities which can most completely i'upply
their own wants, are in a Hate of the highest political perfection.
And both Theory and Experience conspire to prove that a nation
(unlcfs from a very peculiar coincidence of circumstances) cannot
pofTefs much aflive wealth but as the result of extenlive manu
la&ures.â
While also it is manifeft, that the interest of the community is
deeply concerned in the piogrefs of this species of industry, there
is as little room to doubt that the interest of individuals may e
qually be promoted by the pursuit of it. What is there to hin
der the profitable prosecution of roanufa&ures in this countVy -
when it is notorious, that independent of impoficions for the be
nefit of the revenue and for the encouragement o( domestic en
terpriseâthe natur.il commercial charges of the greatest part
of those which are brought from Europe, amount to from fifteen
tothirtyper cent.âarid when it is equally notorious that provili
ons and various kinds of raw materials are even cheaper here
than in the Country from which our principal supplies come {
The dearnefs of labour, and the want of Capital, are the two
great objections to thefuccefs of manufa&ures in the United States.
The full objection ceases to be formidable, when it is re.ol
lefted how prodigiously the proportion of manual labor in a va
riety of manufactures has been decreased by the late improve
ments in the conftru&ion and application of machinesâand when
it is alfoconlidcred to what an extent women, and even children in
the populous parts of the country may be rendered auxiliary to
undertakings of this nature. It is also to be taken into calculati
on, that emigrants may be engaged on reafunable terms in coun
tries where labor is cheap, and brought over to the United States.
The last objeftios dilappears in the eye of those who aie a
ware how much may be done by a proper application of the pub
lic Debt.âHere is the resource which has been hitherto wanted.
And while a direction of it to this object may be made a mean of
public prosperity, and an inftruuient of profit to adventurets in
the enterprise, it, at the fame time affords a profpeil of an en
hancement of the value of the debt, by giving it a new and ad
ditional employment and utility.
It is evident that various fabrics,.under every supposed difad
vantaire are in a vcrv promising train. And that the success has
not uecn KTrrEio!c/co.ifide.Â«bk ciiy bcMacai to very -ofcvwtus
causes.
Scarcely any has been undertaken npon a scale fufÃciently ex
tenfivc, or with a due degree of system. To ensure successâit is
desirable to be able to enter into competition with foreign fabrics
in three particularsâquality, price, term of errdit. To ihe firft,
workmen of equal (kill is an efTential ingredient. The means
employed have not generally been adequate to the pur pole of pro-
Curing them from abroad, and those who have been procurable at
home, have for the molt part been of an inferior class. Tocheap
oefs of price, a capital equal to the puipofe of making all necelfa-
IV advances, and procuring materials on the belt terms, is an in
dispensable requisiteâand to the giving of credit, a capital capa
ble of affording a surplus beyond what is required for carrying
on the business is not less iudifpenfable. But mod undertakings
hitherto have been bottomed on very fhnder refourccs.
To remedy this defctt, an afTociation of the capitals of a num
ber of individuals is an obvious expedentâand the species of
capital which, confilts of the public Stock is susceptible of disposi
tions which will render it adequate to the end. There is good
rcafou to expeÂ£t that as far as (hall be found neceflary money on
reasonable terms may be procured abroad upon an hypothecation
of the stock. It is prefurnable that public Banks would not le
fufe their aid in the fame way to a solid institution of so great
public utility. The pecuniary aid even of government, though
not to be counted upon ought not wholly to be defpaircd of.
And when the Stock (hall have attained its due value so that no
loss will attend the sale, all such aids may be dispensed with.
The Stock may then be turned into specie without disadvantage
whenever specie is called lor.
But it is tafy to fee that upon a good Capita) in Stock, an ef
fective credit may be raised in various ways which will answer
every purpose of specie; independent ot the dirett expedient
of borrowing.
To cflfett the desired afTociation, an incorporation of the Adven
turers nluft be contemplated as a mean necclTary to their security.
This can doubtless be obtained. There is scarcely a State which
could be insensible to the advantage of being the scene of such an
undertaking. But there are rcafons which strongly recommend
the State of New-jersey fbr the purpose. It is thickly populated
âprovisions are there abundant and cheap. The State having
Icarcely any external commerce, and no waste lands to be peo
pled, can feel the impulse of no fuppojed interefl hostile to the ad
vancement of manufa&urcs. Its situation seems to insure a con
stant friendly disposition.
The Â£reat and preliminary desideratum, then, is to form a fuf
ficient Capital. This, it is conceived, ought not to be less than
five hundred thousand dollars.âTowards forming this Capital,
fubferiptions ought immediately to be set on foot, upon this con
dition that no lubfcriber shall be bound to pay until an aÂ£l of In
corporation {hall have been obtainedâfor which, application
may be made as soon as the sums fubfenbed shall amount to one
hundred thousand dollars.
As soon as it is evident that a proper Capital can be formed,
means ought to be taken to procure from Europe fkilful work
men, and such machines and implements as cannot be had hero
infufficient pcrfc&ion. To (his the'exifting crisis of the affairs of
certain parts of Europe appears to be particularly favorable. It
will not be necefTary that all the requisite workmen should be
brought from thence.âOne in the nature of a Joreman tor each
branch may in some branches futtice. In others it may be requi
fife to go further, and have one for each fubdivilion But num
bers of workmen of secondary merit may be found in the United
States ; and others may be quicklv formed.
It is conceived that there would be a moral certaiiity of success
in mannfa&orics of the following articles ;
jft. Paper and Pasteboard.
Saturday, September 10, 1791.
2d. Paper Hangings.
3d. Sail Cloth, and other coarfc .ine'n Cloths, such as Sheet-
ings, Shirtings, Diaper, Ozt lburghs, &c.
4th. The priming of Cottons an 1 Linens ; and as incident to
tnis, but on a fmalier feale, <he manufacturing of the arti
cle to be printed.
sth. Womens Shoes of all kinds.
6th. Thread, Cotton and Worftcd Stockings.
7th. Pottery and Earthen Ware.
Bth.Â» Chip Hats.
9th. Ribbands and Tapes.
10th. Carpets
uth. Blankets. /
12th. Bial'sand Iron Wire.
13th Tiirtad and Fringes.
It will be unnecessary to enter ii; > the details of the execution
further than to observe, that tie etvjjploy ir.ent of the labor-saving
mills and machines is particularly Contemplated.
In addition to the foregoing, a pAewery, for the supply of the
manufacturers as a primal y objeCt, -nay be thought of.
When application (hall be raadtfefor an A6l of Incorporation,
it ought to include a request that pi tvifion may be made for incor
porating the Inhabitants of the dill ift within a certain defined
limit, which (hall be chosen by the company, as the principal feat
of their fa&ories ; and a furth< r r. jueft that the Company may
have permiffton to institute a.Lottery or Lotteries in each year,
fortheterm of five ytars, ford fun or sums, not exceeding in
one year 100,000 dollars. The Staie of New-Jersey, if duly An
fible of its interest in the measure, will not refufe encouragements
of this nature.
An incoiporation of this fort, will be of great importance to
the police of the establishment. It mav also be found eligible to
vest a part of ttye of the Company in the purchase of ground
on which to erett necessary buildings &c. A part of thisground
divided into town lois, may be as erwards a source of profit to
the Company.
The Lottery will answer two purposes. It will give a tempo
rary command of money, and the profit arising from it, will go
towards indemnifying for firft unp oduthve efforts.
The following scheme tor the i-rganifation of the Company,
will probably be an eligible one.-* â¢
1. The capital of the Company, as before remarked, to consist
0f500,000 dollars, to be divided into 5000 shares, each (hare be
ing 100 dollars.
2. Any person, co-partner(hip or body politic, may fubferibe
for as many (hares as he, the, or tf ey may think fit. The sums
fubferibed to be payable, one half in the fund d fix per cent, (lock,
or in three percent, stock, at two .lollars for one, and the other
half in deferred (lock. The payments to be in four equal parts.
The firft at the time of incorporation, the second in fix months af
ter, the third in fix months after t â : second, and the fourth in fix
months after the third. Those w prefer paying in specie, to be
permuu-d to'do ft, ci \ â  -i-g'-V - <"â¢ Sxpei c. â¢ um r.t rzr,
and the deferred according to its present value at the time of pay
ment, discounting the interest thereupon during the suspension of
the payment, at the rate of fix per centum per annum.
3- The affairs of the Company to be under the management of

vernor be not one, shall constitute a board for the tranfa&ion ot

AMONGST the great number of crimes which
sivilized and trading nations have made pe
nal and puni/hed with death, there is no one they
have attacked with a more irremitting vengeance
than FORGtRY; regardless of which,
would be induced to think it a genteel accoui
plilhment ; and no wonder he fliould do To, as
the young men of the pen in North-Carolina, take
a delight in manifefting their genius in the exe
cution of this dangerous practice, committing it
publicly with greater dexterity and adroitness
than in any other country whatever. It is a fact,
and much to be lamented, that on your going in.to the stores of the merchants of this state, into
the public offices, and even in-the houies of the
legislature amonglf the clerks, on every piece or
blotted paper, you may observe an imitation or
the hands and fignacures of -ill the gentlemen
entrulted with public buGtiels, of every gentle
man of eminence, of [he public officers, and 11101 e
especially, of the signers of the paper money, o
ther paper securities, and certificates.
" 1 am an old man, and no Tit/ion, and who in the
round of his life, am known to take as much plea
sure in the advancement of youth as any pei lon,
do declare. I often tremble in observing poor
boys very Ikilful in the use of the pen, without
any expectations from parents, friends or pio
perty. deeply engaged in this baneful science,
making without any intention or knowledge,
huge jlrides to the gallows or the Devil. I will add
the observation of an experienced and sensible
merchant, who gave it to me whilst wi itingâ
" That it is as neceflary in credit, that the hand
writings of men should be as different as their
faces, and t hat a man, who can write every man s
hand, was as dangerous in society, as he who
could put 011 every man's face; that luch a per
son perchance might be honelt, but never could
betrufted : And that if a young man in a count
ing-house in Europe, should he be caught trying
his hand in such business, he would be difinifled,
as soon as for the commission of any offence ; as
no merchant would conceive himfelf fate with
such an adept in the tranfaiftions of business,
where his honor or credit depended." It would
give me great fatisfatflion if any person of more
leisure than I can spare, and greater abilities than
I poflefs, would enlarge on this fubjetf, and be
the happy means of deterring our idle youth, who
generally have no great flock of religion or mo
rality, from this very useless, dangerous and Ican
dalous practice." HERACLI 1 US.

Notwithstanding the rejection of Mr. Fox'Â«
Bill declaratory of the powers of a jury with ref
petft to a verditft in cases of Libel, yet we think,
hereafter no Judge' will venture to press the un
conflitutional docftrine which has for a number
of years obtained, that Juries are not competent
to decide on the point of Latu as well as FaÂ£l\
nor is it likely any Jury will consent to be bul
lied into a verdi<Â£t in which a fellow citizen is
found guilty of publishing a falfe and maliems
Libel, unless the fatfls stated in the indictment are
clearly and fatisfadiorily proved, after the found
and legal opinion delivered by Earl Camden in
the Houfeof Lords on Wednesday, whodeclared,
that " as the law now stood if tvienty-four Juljiti
were to give a decided opinion, and charge, up
on any point of law in ifiue before a Jury, that
Jury had a right, if they thought proper, to hmp
in a vtrdiCl d't-edly contrary to the opinion,s of tltft
Judges, and that vcrd'tfl would flandgood againfl at'
pc-jisr that could bs 'jrzugkt againfl it,' for Tuchver
diift would be founded on the La w of the Land."
In illustration of the above, we have inserted
the following : The firft action for a Libel,fince
the introduction ot Mr. Fox's explanatory Bill,
was tried on Wednesday before Lord Loughbo
rough, in the Court of Common Pleas, wherein
a tea dealer was plaintiff, and an Agent of a
Revenue Officer defendant; the damages were
laid at 2,0001. The learned Judge, in fumniing
up, stated, " that it was his duty to point out
the circuniftances of the cafe, but now it was their
Privilege to determine upon the whole of the
evidence, as their understanding might diretft
theui, withont being influenced in the smallest
degree by him." The defendant juftified ; but
failing in complete proof of his allegations, the
Jury, after retiring a few minutes, returned
with a verdicft for the plaintiff, with *01. dama
ges. Thus under the direiftion of a Chief Jus
tice, we have the instance of the rights of a Jury
to exercise their opinion of the Law as well as
the Fad.

NEWBERN (N. C.) Auguit 20,
Died, on Friday the 12th instant, Col. George
Mitchell, of Onilow county. The particulars
of the tragical manner in which this gentleman
came to his untimely end, have been related to
us in the following manner.
Col. Mitchell and Robert W.Snead, Esq. were
competitors for the honor of representing the
county of Onflow, in the Senate of this ltateâ
The exertions of the candidates and of their
friends had been productive of much ill will and
aniinofity, before the close of the poll, when Mr.
Snead was declared duly elected.
After the eleiftion was closed, Mr. Snead was
observed to call Col. Mitchell from amongst the
people alfembled at the Court-house, and to go
with him into a thicket just by. Shortly after, the
report of a pistol reached the ears of thole who
v/ere at the Court-houfe,and attra<fled them to the
lpot from whence it ifl'ued ; where, in the pre
sence of Mr. Snead only, lay Col.Mitchell a corpse.
Two frefh wounds were discovered on liim ; one
from a pistol Ihot, passing through from hisfhoul
der out below his ribs; the other on the skull,
apparently from a heavy blow with the butt of
the pistol. Mr. Snead was thereupon apprehend
ed, but has been since admitted to bail.
Col. Mitchell bore an unblemiflied characterâ
was very aiftive during the war, and had for ma
ny years the honor of representing his county in
the General Aflembly. He has left a widow and
eight children.

Ex/rail of a letter from Niagara, dated the 2d of
Auguji, to a gentleman on the Mohawk river.
" We have some reason to hope that Col. Sim
coe, our propoted Governor, may come to this
country by the way of your sea-ports, authorised
to fettle with Congress the doubtful line of divi
sionâwhich mutt be a uleaianl thing to both
countries. Capt. Joseph Brant, after having at
tended for some time the councils of the Weitern
Indians at the Miami river, set off a few days ago
for Quebec, attended with leveral of the Chiefs
from" hat quarter ; as they avowedly go to ask
Lord Dorchester's advice, and as we well know
his and government's strong desire for peace, we
would gladly hope that it may be the means of
bringing on an accommodation â much will de
pend 011 the moderation of your fideâyou have
flrength and power, 1 doubt not, to drive them
to the latt extremitiesâbut when you consider,
that moll a flu redly their next resource will be to

the Spaniards, to fettle on their fide, and that the
only motive for thefc offers is to form a barrier
between you and them,which by reftrainingyour
frontier Settlement, will keep you at a dillance
from them, of which they are so jealous. When
you consider the present animosity of the Indians,
aggravated by the loss of their lands, and every
thing dear to them, policy and humanity will

may probably entail a cruel predatory war on

A placard or advertisement, advising theabolition of monarchy,
having been circulated in Paris, occasioned a motion in the Na
tional Assembly on the firft of July, by M. Malouet, that the At
t'orncy-Ge.icral should commence a prosecution against the au
thors. This motion occasioned some debate; the motion was at
length over-ruled (as involving an abridgement of the liberty of
the press) by calling for the order of the day.

to be occasioned solely by a contention between the Basques and
Spaniards relative to the exportation of some timber; other ac
counts fay that they retreated in consequence of hearing that the
King had been arrested in his flight. M. Bouilles' letter which
had been considered as a fabrication, turns out to be genuine ; the

M. La Fayette â" I have leceiYed from Luxembourg, under
cover, from M. de Bouille, two printed copies of his letter to
the National Assembly. If the 'projefls he therein announces
(houM be realized, it will assuredly better become me to combat
himfelf than to reply to his personalities. It is not therefore for
the fake of Bouille, who calumniates my conduct, nor for your
fake, Sirs, who honor me by your confidence, but for the fake of
such as his afTertions may deceive, that I am eager to disprove his
(landers. He denounces me herein an enemy to the form of Go
vernment you have established : Mellieurs, I do not renew the
oath I have taken, but I am ready to shed my blood to maintain
it."
The delivery of thefefentimentswasattended by much applause.
English papers fay, that the Comptc de Merai has pubhclv de
clared at Liege that " the Emperor would never give the least as
sistance to the King and Queen, so long as they remained in Paris,
or even in France." Doubtless all the other sovereigns will regu

EXTRACTS.
The diftinguifliing charatleriflics of men of
great talents, have ever been rather great beau
ties than an exemption from faults ; the works
of Sliakefpeare abound with defecfts that writers
of a mediocrity of talents never could have been
guilty of.
The man who has never attempted to reduce
his asm ideas to writing, fatls or
circumllances with that degree of that
is neceflary for utility. ~ Â«
One great advantage derived from the multi
plied periodical publications now ejctant, is, that
a deviation from the laws of liberality on disputed
fubjeJls is very generally reprobated ; in those
countries where such periodical performances
are rare, the fame illiberality and rudeness is
found to prevail which formerly disgraced lite
rary controversies.
Alexander the Great, when he conquered Alia,
imposed only the fame tribute which they had
before paid to Darius.â It being observed to him
that he might draw a much larger revenue from
that country, he replied, that " he did not ap
prove of that gardener who, after gathering the
fruit, cuts down the treei themselves to fell
them." This answer is founded on common
senseâand jet there are many instances to be
found in history of princes and rulers, who have
rather chose to follow the example of the gar
dener, and stupidly dry up the sources of their
incomes by their oppreflion.

Extract of a letter from Cape-Francois, August 16.
Our lately formed colonial Atlembly has ad
journed, to meet in this place the 25th inltant.
ft f'eems by your late accounts that the King and
Queen of F ranee have been detected in an attempt
to escape out of the Kingdom. 1 fear that this
event will produce much future confuflon ; tho
the philanthropic cannot but view with delight
every attempt to raise the fair fabric of freedom
on the ruins of despotic sway, I think he must be
at a lofsto decide whether the conllitution ofthe
new French government will lead to that valua
ble end.
Thursday morning died, to the inexprefHble grief of his pa
rents, Marcus C. Knox, in the 9th year of his ageâthe second
son of Hon. General Knox, Secretary at Warâand yesterday his
funeral proceeded from his Father's house, in Chefnut-ftreet, to
St. Peter's Church, attended by the Profeffors and Preceptors of
the College and Academy of this city, a long proceflion of the
Youth of that seminary, and a numerous train of mourning friends.
THE PARENT'S CONSOLATION,
[_An ExtraEl from the Majfachujetts Magazine J\
MY heart beats sympathy, and melts with
tears of condolance.âCan the agony of grief be
soothed by the meltings of friendfhip ?âCan the
torture of an afflitfted mind be afiuaged by thÂ»
sympathetic fob ?âI answer, yes-âsuch is the con
stitution of the human affections.
Your grief is pungent.âSadden transition !â
from blooming health to violent difeafe.âQbick
and unexpected was its attack, and furprizingly
rapid its progress.âTo-day a lovely blooming
boyâ to-morrow a cold corpse, encloJed in its
(hroud.
Your fond imagination might indulge the
pleasing thought of feeing the tender bosom ex
pand and ripen to manhood, a blefling to society,
and comfort to its friends.âPleafing delusion Iâ
Death hath nipped it in its bud, and made it to
wither and die. But why dwell on the affecting
scene .' Behold its gentle spirit disengaged from
the encumbrance of flefh, wafted by congenial
spirits to the paradise of God ; hear it welcomed
to feats of everlasting bliss and joy.
Call the consolations of religion to your aidâ
those can mitigate the poignancy of yourforrow,
and teach you to submit to a difpenfatioii so griev
ousâthey will calm the ruffled emotions of your
breast, produce resignation tothe divine will, and
lead you to view every event, however adverse,
as directed byconfununate wisdom, and designed
for our moral improvement and advantage.
Animated by these reflections, the gloom of
grief will diflipate, and your mind bereftored to
serenity.

In the name of God, one in the h'.'j T. init)
St AnislausAdG oSTtrs, bv the grace of God, ana
the will of the Nation, King of Poland, Grand
Duke of Lithuania, Russia, Pruflia, Mufcovia,
Saniogitia, &c. &c. &c. together with the Con
federated States aflembled in double number
to represent the Polish nation.
PERSUADED that our common fate depends
entirely upon eftablilhing and rendering per
fect a national conititution , convinced by a long
train of experience of many defecfts in our Go
vernment, and willing to profit by the present
circumltances of Europe, and by tne favorable
moment which has restored us to ourselves ; tree
from the difgracefnl ihack'.es of foreign influ
ence ; prizing more than life, and every personal
confideraiion, the political exiltence, external in
dependence, and internal liberty of the nation,
whose care is eiitrulted to us; desirous, more
over, todefervethe blessing and gratitude, not
only' of our cotemporaiies, but also of future
generations ; for the fake of the public good, for
i'ecuring our liberty, and maintaining our king
dom and our pofleffions ; in order to exert our
natural rights with zeal and firmnefs, we do so
lemnly ejlahijh the present Constitution, which we
declare wholly inviolable in every part, till such
period as lhall be prescribed by law; when the
nation, if it should think fit, and deem it necefla
ry, may alter, by its express will, fiich articles
therein as shall be found inadequate. And this
present Constitution fliall be the (landard of all
laws and itatutes for the future Diets.
ARTICLE I.
Th: dominant National Religion.
The Holy Roman Catholic Faith, with all its
privileges and immunities, {hall be the dominant
national religion. The changing of it for any
other persuasion is forbidden under the penalties
of apoftacy ; but as the fame holy religion com
mands us to love our neighbours, we therefore
owe to all people, of whatever persuasion, peace
in matters of faith, and the protection of govern
ment; consequently we a(Ture,to all persuasions
and religions, freedom and liberty according to
the laws of the country, and in all dominions of
the republic.
ARTICLE 11.
Nobility, or the Eqmftrian 0-dcr.
Revering the memory of our ancestors with
gratitude, as the firft founders of our liberties, it
is but just to acknowledge, in a molt solemn man
ner, that all the pre-eminence and prerogatives
of liberty, both in public and private life,fhould
be insured to this order ; especially laws, (latutes,
and privileges, granted to this order by Cafi-.nir
the Great, Lewis of Hungary, Ladiflaus Jagellon
and his brother Wittoldus, Grand Duke of Li
thuania ; alio by Ladiflaus and Cafimirus, both
Jagellons; by John Albertus, Alexander, Sigif
mundus the First, and Sigifmundus Augustus (the
J alt of the Jagellonic race) are by the pi elent act
renewed, confirmed, and declared to be inviola
ble. We acknowledge the rank of the noble
Equestrian order in Poland, to be equal to all de
grees of Nobilityâall persons of that order to
be equal among themselves, not only in the eli
gibility to all ports of honor, trull, or emolu
ment, but in the enjoyment of all privileges and
prerogatives appertaining to the said order : and
in particular, we preserve and guarantee to eve
ry individual ihereof personal liberty and Secu
rity of territorial and moveable property as they
were formerly enjoyed ; nor Hi all we even fuffer
the lead encroachment on either by the supreme
national power (on which the present form of go
vernment is established) under any pretext what
soever, contrary to private rights, either in part,
or in the whole ; consequently we regard the
preservation of perfonai iecqritv and property,
as by law ascertained, to be a tie of society, and
the very efl'ence of civil liberty, which ought to
be considered and respected for ever. It is in
this order that we repose the defence of our li
berties and the present Constitution : It is to their
virtue, valour, honor, and patriotism, we recom
mend its dignity to venerate, and its (lability to
defend, as the only bulwark of our liberty and
existence.
ARTICLE 111
Towns and Citizens,
The law made by the present Diet, entitled,
Cur royal free towns -within the dominions of the Re
public, we mean to consider as a part of the pre
sent constitution, and promise to maintain it as a
new, additional, true, and effectual support, of
our common liberties, and our mutual defence.
ARTICLE IV
Peasants and Villagers.
This agricultural class of people, the most nu
merous in the nation, consequently forming the
most considerable part of its force, from whole
OF THE
156
hands flows the source of our riches, we receive
under the protection of national law and Govern
ment, from the motives of justice humanity,
chrittianitv.and our own interest well understood,
enacting, 'that whatever liberties, grants, and
conventions, .bet ween the proprietors and villa
gers, either individually or collectively may be
allowed in future, and entered authentically into ,
/uch agreements, according to their true mean
ing fhtll import mutual and reciprocal obliga
tions, binding not only the. present contracting
parties, but even their fucceflors by inheritance
or acquisitionâso far, that it (hall not be in the
power of either party to alter at pleasure such
contracts importing grants on one iide, and vo
luntary promise of duties, labour, or payments,
rfn the other, according to the manner and con
ditions therein exprefied, whether they are to lalt
perpetually, or for a fixed period. Thus having
insured to the proprietors every advantage they
have a riÂ«rbt to from their villagers, and willing
to encourage most effectually the population oi
our country, we fvblijh and proclaim a perjtfl ana
entire liberty to all people, either who may be new
ly coming to fettle, or those who, having emi
grared, would return to their native country ;
and we declare most solemnly, that any person
coming into Poland from whatever part of the
world,"or returning from abroad, as soon as he
sets his foot on the territory of the Republic, be
comes free and at liberty toexercife his indnftry,
wherever, and in whatever manner he pleases
to fettle either in towns or villages, to farm and
rent lands and houses, on tenures and contracts,
for as long a term as may be agreed 011 ; with li

hat its beautiful situation is not furpaffcd, if equalled by any ; bc
ng in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the lound
hut by realon of the flats, this wharf is neceffar.ly extended 10 the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the most extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3-4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all claflcs of people, for
the success of this enterprise, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet publitlied in
Ameriea)inducethe managers to believe the tickets will meet with
a speedy sale.
The drawing will pfctively commence at the State-House, in
New-Haven, on the Â»Â«jtli of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be published, and the prizes
paid on demand, by the managers. Those prizes notcalled for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
for the use ot the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.
