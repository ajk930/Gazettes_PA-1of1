CONGRESS.
HOUSE or REPRESENTAnrES.
WEDNESDAY, January a.
De bate on Mr. SrgEie's motion for
of the Military
Establishment of the
United States.
In Committee of the Whole. Mr. White
iâ Ciair*
Mr. Wadfworth firft noticed Mr.
Steele's statements and calculations.â
These he said, were erroneous, and even
if cone&, the inferences the gentleman
had drawn from them, did not appear to
himjuft. He was fuiprifed the gentle
man (hould so pofitivelv have pledged
himfelf for their accuracy, when they
were so very far from deserving that cha
racter. As the statements of Mr. Steele
had been published to the world he tho't
it right to Hate in what they aie errone
ous.
The great object of that gentleman in
offering his calculations to the House,
was to (hew a prodigious progrefiive en
creafe in the expences of the war depart
ment, since the establishment of the new
government. Fc)r this purpose he had
compared what he Hated as the appropri.
ations of the years 1790, 1791, and
1792, with one another, and with the
sum now called for from that department
for the year 1793.
Mr. Wadfworth proceeded to (hew the
inaccuracy of the gentleman in this at
tempt, by the following llatement.
Mr. Steele stated, that for 1790, the
appropriations for the Quartet-matter's
department amounted to

Fiom the foregoing, the inaccuracy of
Mr. Steele's flatements, and of the calcu
lations founded on them, were evident.
The prodigious rapid cncreafe of the war
department expences did not appear, ynd
the gentleman's saving plan, founded on
the difference of the appropriation for
J792, and the sum estimated for 1793,
proved very trifling indeed, amounting
to a few thousands only.
Mr. Wadfwoith said he did not posi
tively pledge himfelf for the absolute ac
curacy of his statements, but if there were
errors in them he ventured to fay they
were but tiifling.
He next took notice of Mr. Steele's ar
guments relative to the ordnance depart
ment. Fiom what had been said by that
gentleman on this he truly thotight, as he
had exprefied it, that the business boie a
ludicrous appearance . but on further en
quiry, by looking over an account of the
expenditures of the war department, it ap
peared that the large sums appropriated
for the ordnance department, far from be
ing expended in the purchase of cannon,
not one (hilling had gone to that life, it
was all for repairs to arms, See. The state
ment of the gentlemen in this particular
he could not conceive confident with can
dour.
As the gentleman from N. C. relied his
aflertion ofarbufes in the war department,
on the ftatern,entÃ he had produced, these
aflmioiis, he conceived, he fufSgiently
answered, by ffiewing the statements inif
ftated.

Mr. Wadfworth referred to parts of the
Secretary at war's reports to (hew that
that officer had been in favour of concilia
tory, and averse to hostile measures with
the Indians, to another part to fhnw hid
opinion where and how militia were effec
tive.

He next turned to the causes of the
war. The establishment of a war depart
ment was, in his opinion, by no means, as
had been fuggetled, the cause of the In
dian war, but rather theeffeft. The war
existed before the eftablilhment of the pre
sent government, it is an inheritance from
the old confederation and so is the war
department. The history of its origin
and progtefs was in record and might be
traced by a reference to the resolves of
congress. The war exitted in 1784. A
communication received some years back
from the executive of Georgia would e
vince its exigence and shew its violence.
The executive complained that the fron
tier was too thinly fettled, and some coun
ttes broken up, and ordered out 3000
men to protest it,âsince that even the
city of Savannah was, he had heard, so
fenoufly threatened,that the citizens were
obliged to keep guard in itâand this be
fore the prefcat war system.
Neither could the present mode of car
rying on the war be called the creature of
the war department. It was rather the
Prelident s war,âor the war indeed of
the house, the war of the legislature : the
plan was a good one as the experience of
the Prefulent in these wars made him a
proper judge ; it had his approbation and
we know it.

cruelty of the whites towards the- Â»riilians,
he also Hated the information of Judp-e
Innis, of the depredations of the Indians:
the single diftrid of Kentucky had tall
from 1783 to 1790, 1500 men, women,
and children, killed and taken, with 2000
horses and other property, amounting to
at least 50,000 dollars, and to these lie
attributed the war in which we were in
volved. The hiftoiy of the settlement of
Kentucky, if recurred to, would afford a
series of causes of Indian hÂ»ltilities. Two
hundred persons had annually fallen facri
fices to the Indians in this district.
He .next proceeded to examine the opi
nion advanced of the superiority of militia
over regular forces in an Indian war. He
recurred to history to disprove the opini
on. So early as the year after Braddock's
defeat, he said, Virginia attempted to pro
tect itfelf agaitift the incurlions of the In
by cfULlHaing a number of pofU Â«-
long their frontier. The Indians, notwith
ftaading, penetrated the frontier, came
-60 miles within it, and drove the inhabi
tants as far as Winchester. In the war
which succeeded the peace of '62, garri
sonÂ», 14 or 15 in number,>were ettablifti
ed, to afford the wi/hed for protection ;
they were all captured by the Indians, 3
or 4 excepted. The Pennsylvania fron
tier had been more than once penetrated
notwitbftanding the resistance of the mili
tia. He next cited the instance of Col.
Bouquet's success against the Indians with
only two regiments of regular troops,
which had even been much weakened by
campaign in the Well-Indies.â
These two regiments marched into the
Indian country. At firlt finding 110 sup
port on the frontier, and when arriving at
Carlisle where he expedted to be aided by
stores, troops, See. he found a general pa
nic had taken poffeflion of the frontierâ
the counry of Cumberland, through
which he was to pass desertedâthe roads
covcred with distressed families; but here
having got together a few pack horses he
stood in need of, he ilill advanced with
the few troops under his command, and
gave the Indians battle. The combat
lalted from one o'clock till night, was re
newed the next morning, continued thro'
the day, and ended with the total rout &
aeftrudtion of the Indian army. Fie then
stationed his force in a commanding fort,
and so effectually restored peace to the
frontier, and spirit to the inhabitants,
that lliey returned to their homes, which
they had abandoned and lent their assist
ance against the foe the next campaign.
With the militia of Virginia and Penn
sylvania he entered the heart of the ene
mje's country, and forced the Indians to
iubmiffion. He cited another instance ef
the success of Indians against militia. The
engagement between 800 militia, under
Gen Herkemer, and 700 Indians, and
others, where a total overthrow was given
to the militia.
T he firft check the troops of the Unit
ed States niet with during the operation
of the present war fyllem he adverted to,
in the expedition under Gen. Â£larmar. In
that instance the want of vigour in the
militia is acknowledged by their own
commander ; and as to the expedition un
dei Gen. St. Ciair, the regulars were few
and not to be named when compared with
the number of the militia. The advanced
guaid, in this action, composed entirely
of these, not only run off without firing,
but even threw away their guns and per
haps their coats too, which circumllancc
may account for the appellation of coal
men, given to our men by the Indians.
He next took notice of a late instance,
the engagement between Major Adair,
commanding a party of militia, and some
Indians. He expressed his good opinion
of that officer, but the conduit of his men
he wiftied to bring to view ; and this he
etinced from the commander's own letter
wherein he fays, " that the Indians ob
tained their end, the triumph is theirs,"
and in another place, " I will candidly

Mr. Wadfworth then combated the o
pinion advanced, that Indian expedition
by militia, were less expensive than by re
gular troops ; after mentioning several
iafts to the contrary, he inltanced Gene
ral Clark's western expedition which had
cost, he was not prepared to fay how
much, but immetife Turns. He appealed
to gentlemen who had commanded militia
and continentals in the late war to de
clare which appeared to them the moll
efficient troops,âthe gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. Parker) who had spoken
in favour of the resolution before the
house, he fakl, in one instance in the late
war, if be recollected right, had no great "
reaion to boast of Ins companions. He
mentioned, as encroafing the expence,
waft of (lores, inseparable from ex
pet'iiioÂ®: with militia, as well as wjlle J
lives. One regiment of militia will de-
Itroy, m the fame space of time more
than a Brigade of regular troops, as it is
impoflible to introduce discipline among
The settlement of Kentucky, Tie said,
which had been protected by militia, had
colt more blood than the whole American
war, he believed. If the number oflives
101 l in that undertaking could be compu
ted it would make the refle6ting shudder.
Something had been said of the tardy
nature of military operations with regular
troops, and it had been remarked, that
an expedition this year had not been effec
ted. He attributed this to the slowness
of the recruiting service, owing to the
clamour raised against the war by those
opposed to the present system, Besides,
the government had been blamed for not
(hewing pacific dispositions towards the
Indians, and had withheld the war, to
procure peace by treatyâa vain hope,
But leveral attempts had been made on
our part to procure peace. The faate of"
Harding, and others, were melanhcoly e
vidences of this truth : But the certainty
was, as it appeared to him, that the In
dial's must be forced to make peace, they
would not be quiet of choice.
A gentleman fiom Virginia had objec
ted to a refpe&able military eftablilhmenr,
because it would produce an increase of
military among the Britilh and Spaniards,
to the North and South of us This was
no rea lon with him, why the United
States Jhould not make themselves respec
table in the eyes of the Indians.
Some years since, they told us of their
confederacy, and to think of no separate
treatiesâto keep on our fide of the Ohio.
We now flatter ourselves with peace, be
cause they have told us they will treat
but in what lanjrunge, and by whom dic
tated, I am forbid to tell, the door 9 were
closed when we received it.
1 tie fame gentleman had also mention
ed those enhlting in our feivice as worth
lets cliaradters : the sweepings of the
streets, &c. They appeared to him as
refpedtable, he said, as the generality of
those who turned out in the American
war.
He made some further observations on
the comparative excellence of regulars and
militia, and brought some further instan
ces into view in support of his opinion.
Abuks, jt had been intimated, had
ciept into our army ; no army could be
totally free from abuses, he observed, and
he gave it as his opinion, that the army
of the United States was as free from them
as most, especially when its diltance from
the feat of government was considered.
He concluded by a recapitulation of
the sentiments he had expressed, and
which should influence him to vote againll
the motion. Efpccially as the system had
been adopted after mature conHderation.
I o change it now would argue that
when it was firll adopted, it was done *
with unbecoming halte, or (hew a great
inilability. The Indians would laugh at
us as inconsistent, and might be inducc4

A NEW PARTY DICTIONARY,
CALCULATED for the accommodation
of thole whole plcafurc it is to be dis
pleased with Congress, but who find it diiilcult
to remember, and who,' probably, never knew
all the cau'esof t!?eir displeasure.
The terms are not fully made known. The
Worthy compilers of this work, having the
public good foiely in view, have declared that
the price lhall be set as low as can pollibly be
afforded. It is their desire to extend the cir
culation of this valuable book as generally as
they can. Having a man in their, conftent
pay, and who, in. the ordinary bufii-efs for
which they hired him has prepared fl great
part of materials of this Compilation, they
flatter themselves the expence of authorlhip
and even that of printing will be nearly saved,
so that the purchasers will have the book for
ajpioft nothing. They are undecided whe
ther the types and paper ftiall be American or
French.
The nature of this great literary under
taking will readily appear by perusing
THE PREFACE.
OUR rude Saxon ancestors spoke their mo
ther tongue as their mothers did before them.
It is not to be supposed that the Dictionaries
in common use, tracing-words up to their ety
mology and their queer old falh'oned senses,
can be of use at this day of philosophy, when
the world, in refpeft to its politics, seems as
if there was another fun hung up to light itâ
Indeed there is such a glare that common
eves are overpoweredâit is dark with ex
ceflive lightâAll France is groping about in
the dark of too much light, as if every man's
vision were destroyed by the intense adtion of
aborning glass. They need a new Dictiona
ryâfor what could they read jit any old book,
that would teach them the present state of
their opinions in regard to religion. In their
Dictionaries, King David is still in good cre
ditâwhereas, all the world knows, the Sec
tion PoifTonniere, by a formal decree, has un
king'd him, and unfainted him, and now he
may {fcr.ke hands with Louis XVI. who is in
the fame plight by a vote of the Convention.
To come to our country, the necefiity of
this work is equally manifelt. What would
a found well principled party man do with the
old Saxon Huff about justice and order and
truth : It would stop his mouth before he had
halt* done talking again ft the public debt and
Congress and Mr. Adams and his Book. As
our language and ideas change, so should the
Di&iopary. Now this Di&ionary* would serve
to fix both language and ideas. It would ast
like a strong pickle on the mod periftiable of
fal of the Gazettes, and keep it over the fea
fonâlt would make every inflamatory pa
ragraph common ftockâ(o that the effoft
would be an union of fentiinent and force.
The man in Georgia and he in New-Hamp
fliire by reading the Axioms gathered from
the National Gazette, might help each other
in their anger. Each would take the fame
text and vouch the fame proofs.
The urgent occasion for this work is appa
rent from the torpid ftnte of men's minds.
They scarcely think at all, and the govern
ment does as it chufes. When they do think
there is no end to their deviations from the
new political truth, notwithstanding the pains
that the virtuous writers against Congress
have taken to enlighten tbeni. There is no
manner of doubt these excellent friends to
republican Simplicity and virtue have had
influences from Monf. Petion, the
fountain head. It is evident, if oaths are to
be regarded, that this influence is neither di
rest nor indirect. But some Sylph or Gnome,
who is doubtless a good Anti, whiSpers it to
the fate foretelling oracle, the National Ga
aettb From whence,-in ftreanis pure and
finOffking, like the drain from a whifkv dis
tillery, it is conveyed to the reservoirs efta-
blifhed ill every part of the country. The
plants of satire and some of the flowers of
rhetoric fpruig up where it flows. The para
graphs againlt the laws of Conjjrefs, against
the Vice-Prefidant and the Secretary of the
Treasury, are (mart enough to raise blisters.
Their writers have not wanted zeal, thev
have not spared paper nor confidenceâfor re-
" publican virtue they fay, smiles on their la
bours. While truthlafted and would answer,
* they fired it off. But ammunition failing,
they loaded their pieces with what they could.
Noinijjrefiion, however, is made on the peo
ple. They have piped, but the people will
not dance. Newspaper accounts of oppreflion
and coAnptioti and conspiracies against liber
â¢ ty, cannot stir citizcrs who arc growing rich
and live contented. Time and opportunity
. happen to sill men. What will not do now
may Succeed another time. Let the means
be prepared and kept ready. I; there no way
to prefei ve the fugitive and evanescent lies
of the day for future commotion? There is

This, however, is a niiferable otejudice. For

Foreign Affairs.
Sunday -night lafl the November Packet arrived at
New-York Falmouth. This vejjel brings
European Intelligence to the 2cth oj November.
BRUSSELS, November 9.
YOU must have observed in my last, that
the affairs of this country were taking a
very different turn from what had been ex
pected. The event of Tuesday last is too
great a proof of this. The French attacked,
on that day, the Austrian army near Mons,
with so much impetuosity, that in the a&ion,
which lasted from 8 in the morning till 4
o'clock in the afternoon, the whole Austrian
army was completely routed, and retreated
to Caftiau, a league beyond Mons. At 6in
the evening, Dumourier tent a trumpeter to
offer the place to capitulate.
The capitulation was acccpted, and the
French took potTelfion of Mons on'NV'edne/day
at 12 o'clock at noon. As Toon as the fujfcri
ority of the French army was known, orders
were sent to the troops in Flanders to fall
hack upon Mons, and succours were sent for
to Prince Hofienloe's army. All thele suc
cours, united, form still an army of 50,000
men, which is at present posted at Braine le
Compt and Nivel'es, whilll the head of the
French army is already at Soignies. It is as
sured that the capitulation was signed on the
7th by General Dumouiier's adjutant and
Gen. Beaulieu, who had remained in the city
with 2 battalions.
The capitulation fiat?*, " That the Aus
trian troops fliall have evacuated the Belgic
254
Provinces before v the 15th of this montl , ex
cept the provinces ot Luxembourg, Limberg,
and GuelderJacd." Dumourier has planted
the tree of liberty in Mons, and gibbets ior
thole who shall manifefl a spirit of party, or
fliall disturb the public tranquility. This
ft rift police fliould tianquilize the inhabitants
of the other cities; that, however, is not the
cafe here, for since the day before yciierday,
is in the greatcft agitation and alarm.
Every body is gerting away, and tho the
Duke of Saxe and the Archduke Charles a e
liil 1 in tJÂ»e army, the Archduchess fat off yef
terdav, fonie fay for Bonne, others lav f<Â»i the
Hague. The Plenipotentiary Miniiter, as
weil as all the members ot the government,
are also gone to Rutemonde Â»n Guelderland.
In fliort, it a general breaking up. The
army of Bourbon, which lias fled troin the en
virons, from Namur, arrived last night at the
gates of this city, but entrance was rciufed
them.
The number of the fugitives to Holland
had already filled the city of Antwerp, where
a number of emigrants, who could not procure
lodgings, attempted, {word in hand, to force
the inhabitants to lodge them, on which the
inhabitants fell upon them and their baggage,
which they plundered.

A most important discovery, to the great benefit
. L. /-â¢ _ : - I - - : -1
of the Commercial woild
A gentleman of this state, by way of experi
ment, had a Palmetto Tice fa wed into fhcathing
boards ; about twelve months past, he had a
fmallveflel Hieathcd with it and let her run the
whole.summer without once gravirtg or clean
ing, and on examination, found her bottom as
found 3'd untouched (vv the firll day
the was fhcathrd. He hod also funk a plank, of
the fame, which lay under water for 6 months ;
on taking it up, it was riot only perfectly found,

The unanimity in lo many refpe&able states,
in favor of the re-eleÂ£lion of Mr. Adams, fnews
in what estimation the fcribbJeis against him
are held bv the people. For three years pill,
foirie'of our papers have teemed with repeated
and re-rcpeated denunciations ot his politics
and his condu&. The meanness of private ati
e dote, the quibbling of lawâcraft, and the un
biulhing insinuations of falfliood, have, in rota
tion, been employed as weapons agninlt him â
To the aid of tnefc, industry has been called in ;
and while a D sat the feat ot government
has spread hrs malevolence* in every direction,
an Â£âIâs has mounted his Rofwante, and has
alfailed every quarter to prevent his re-ele&ioti,
by endeavouring to injure his reputation. To
the sober sense of the people the appeal has been
madeâ and they have given their verdiÂ£t. They
have emphatically said to
" Envy be dumb âand Malice Ihut your mouth,
Or squirt your venom on the Frebean Chore."â
We may, therefore, for a time, expert a cefia
tion ot the obloquy, and the people be tfifreby
relieved from the insult of wtitings whiwh'dif.
play nothing bnl. the malevolence of thefr au

PORTLAND, December 25.
Capt. Titcomb, in ;cÂ£ Ihip Aiadr.e, arriv
ed here 011 Saturday last, from Liverpool,
which place he left the 2oth if October. J>j( t
before Capt. Titcomb failed. Fie ';.w and con
versed with the noted Col. Tarlton, who
was then direftiy from the Duke of Brunf
wick's army. The account given t>v the Col.
was as follows : That the French General,
Dumourier, had taken poiTeffion front of the
Duke of BrunfwickâThat he had polled the
other two French arjÂ» ies, one on the right,
and the other on the left of the Duke. f>u
mourier gave way, and retreated "before the
enemy, (carrying with him the people of the
country, together with all tine* livp ijtock and
all their provisions) till he had drawn the
Doke's army into Champagne. .Here du
mourier made a Itand, and proposed a truce.
Mean while, the two armies on the right and
left of the Duke, were marching towards his
rear; and in their progress, were, like Du
mourier, either taking or caufmg
to be removed, all the live ftoi k, provilioa
and forage in the country. It was the time
of the vintage, and the provi lions of the Auf
trians and Prulfians falling lhoi t, they had
recourse to the grapes which abound in that
country. The immediate consequence ot
which was a deadly flux among the troops.
In this lituation, the Duke readily agreed to
Dumourier's proportion of a truce. This
was jufl as the latter would have had it. An
interview took place betwixt tie Generals,
in which Dumourier, after a dallying confe
rence of several days, informed rhe Duke that
he could do nothing decifivc till he had writ
ten to, and heard from the National Conven
tion. During this time, however. theFrenct
armies were improving every moment. Thai
of Dumourier had taken such portions as ren
dered it abfolutelv impregnable. Those on
the right and left were progrelling toward?
the Duke's rear, and as they Svent,fwept witl
them every article of provilion, whether foi
man or beast.âAster a truce of five or fix
days, and when the Auflrians and Pru<rianÂ«
Vere reduced to the u tin nit dift'efs, foine 01
them starving to death, others dying 0:
the bloody flux, Dumourierpietended to grow
difiatisfied, and said he would break the tract
up ! The Duke altonifhed and confounded
proposed to continue it ; and it was at this
time, probably, that he made tiie concefiions
and adopted the kind and conciliating Jan.
guage which has been mentioned.âDumou
rier, however, said " NOâhe had continuec
the truce long enoughânow he mu ft fight"â
A truce betwixt two parties is a thing that i:
well enough, while both t.'ill to it, bu!
when one of them dijagreci, it will always hap
pen that the other must either fight or rui
away. This was precifelv the Duke's fltua
tic:i ; and he chose to run away. By thi:
time, however, General Kellerman had gainet
his rear ; and although his army was not o:
fufficient force compleatJy toftoptiie progref
of the Duke, it was llilleqval to the purpo e
for which it was intended, viz.âto retail
and harrafs him ; and itrip the country of e
very kind of provilion. So that famine ant
desolation were spread on the right, the left
and in the front of the Duke and his retreat
ing army ; disease and death iu the centre .
and in the rear was Dumourier and the sword
The retreat was as rapid as it could he madÂ«
with an army of lick, disheartened and dyiilj
soldiersânumbers Â«;f whom were left behind
as also their baggage, artillery and militar;
{lores, in immenle quantities.âNothing was
laid in the Duke's army at this time, on tin
fubjeft of Marijcjlos ; and if he is hurried 01
at this rate, he may not have time to ilfu<
another till he gets "fairly out of the Frenc!
territoriesâor if he should, it is poflible tiia

COMMUNICATIONS.
We have men who go round and round like
mill-horse? in the drudgery of defaming the
officers of government. They repeat over
and over again the fame humdrum tales of
vice and folly, which they tax every body
with but their own angelic fa&ion. It is in
vain to read to this party the preceptâ
44 Thou fhalt not bear falfe witness against
thy neighbor," because the old book which
records this honest and gotod-natured advice
is out of crsdit with thetfe profane faints,
these men of new inspiration, who set about
reforming us out of oui old principles.
There are certain things often tranfifted
by collaftive bodies, which no individual of
them will juftify or defend.
We may very fafely confer honor on imagi.
vary heroes, because among such there is 110
comparison of merits.
To praise a man, because we suppose he
thinks as we do, is nothing less than an indi
rect compliment to ouifelves.
To clog our attachment to the governmeat
which we have ourselves eftablithed, with
conditions founded on arbitrary conftruftions,
is, to fay the least, cold-hearted patriotism.
To be governed by- principles abftracied
from men, is an idea tooevanelcent for com
mon useâTo be governed by men, without
regard to principles, is passive obedience.
It is a very pleaflet thing to feel superior
to all the reft of mankind.
Every class of citizens, in supporting the
community, support themselves. If by their
utmost exertions in their various vocations,a
bare competency only can be obtained, what
would be their fate, (hould they employ one
half theii time in political (Ã¼bje^ts.
Suspicion is the virtue of bale mindsâthose
who have no honesty themselves, are <;om
monlv the firft to cry out riT ucâiltaking kriijf
the old proverb.
The principles suited to one period, will
not he found adapted to anotherâif they will
apply on all octafions, the work ot'deftruftion
will never be fnilhed.
The public liberty is to be guarded by the
vigilance of the peopleâbut an ignorant peo
ple will ne\ er be active from principleâtheir
vigilance therefore will always be directed by
individuals who may have an infereft in be
traying the liberties and the government of a
country. The truth is the people asfiuh,
cannot always watch ; but afford to every in
dividual the means of inftruflion, and they
will invariably chufe their be ft friends for
their rulers and watchmen.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse for break
ing it. But it is beyond que ft ion a cause of
its being broken. Seveu-eighths of the
wretches who fuffer punishment for crimes,
are destitute of learning. A tyrant is fr.id to
have hung up his Jaws in fmail letters, and on
a high poll-, so that the people could not read
them. He is justly execrated for thus catch
ing innocent tranfgreiiors in a trap. But
what shall be laid of the neglect of those legis
lators who Puffer the citizens to remain so un
provided of comrrton school advantages, that
if the laws were written in large letters, and
not hung on a high post, but on a level with
their eyes, they would not be able to read
them. At least this is the cafe in regard to
thousands of our citizens. Is it not a fiiame
in a free country ! With refpeft to Tuch vic
tims of ignorance, it may be truly said, our
criminal flatutes are firft made known at the
wbipping-poft, and the knowledge they get of I
their nature is written on their backs.
There can be no true liberty without good laws ; i\o
good laws without firm government ; no firm go
vernment without public conjidence : no public confi
dence without difmtercftediiHs in tfroje ivho ;
no security jor this virtue but in the watchiuliiefs

ro lard the proceedings of the government with
indifctimina?e and exaggeratedpraifc is not the
way to serve the government. Doubts and fujpicionx
are bred by the over-eager ne ft to prevent them.
Conhdering the difficulty in all governments of pre
venting the / rust es oj the public interefls from carv

lu some part of his argument, he ex
prefled it, a* his opinion, that notwithT
Itanding apuearances to the contrary,
wt Ihould not have peace very soon.
Mr. Steele i.hfeivcd, that be doubted
not tht comuiiuee , would give the sub-
jest a consideration suited to its import
'tatice ; if in the course of discussion it
should not appear of that impoitance he
hud deemed it to be, they will treat it ac
cordingly. He (hould uot have lifcn thus
early in the debate, if the gentleman last
speaking had not controverted;his emu
lations hy some of his own, without shew
ing from what fourfce he had taken
them. Here Mr. WadfwortU referied to
the appropriation bills, theprincipal patt
of which, he said, he had read. Mr. Steele
proceededâhe recapitulated the substance
of his several statements, to Ihew the pro
grtffive encreafe of the expences of the
Department. He declared himfelf
superior to any pcrfonal conlideratious,
or of private pique against the Secretary
of War; and in refpedt to the Prefideut
of the United States, he profeffed the
warmeli attachment to his perfoh and cha
racter. In coming forward on this occa
sion, he waÂ» actuated by motives of public
contidei ation, from a conviction that the
system npw purfucd would prcrve pernici
ous in the end.
Mr. Wadfworth rofc to explain: he dis
claimed all personal considerations; he
thought himlclf as much fupeiior to them,
as the gentleman latl speaking. ihe mode
of treating the fubjeÂ£t adopted by that
gentleman had drawn forth fame remarks
from him, which he considered as ftri&ly
proper, and which he (hould not have
done his duty not to have made.
Mi". Hartley was against adopting
the motion under the present circum
stances of the country, and he entered
into a particular investigation of the me
rits of the qneftionâWhen the lalt law
for the more effe&ual protection of the
frontiers passed, the fubjeft now under
coniideration was very fully and ably dis
cussed, and the gentlemen who weie averse
to the augmentation, had fcveval altera
tions made to fatisfy them.
Instead of the Prcfident's being obliged
to raise the whole of the three regiments,
he was to exercise his discretion either to
make the augmentation complete, or raise
a part and had authority to di(band theni
after raised. The 12th fe&ion of the law
is thjis expressed, " That it (hall be law
ful for the Pielident of the United States
to forbear to raise or to disband after they
(hall be raised the whole or any part of
the three additional regiments in cafe e
vents (hall in his judgment render his f<>
doing confident with the public fafety.
We (hould therefore consider, whether
circumstances have so materially changed
since that time as to lender it proper that
the legislature (hould eiiterfere, repeal the
powers given to the President, and dis
charge the three regiments.
This necessarily leads us fii ft, to view
the lituation of our finances, and the (late
of the frontiers at, and immediately be
fore the time of pafiing the law.
The extent of our revenue was not as
well known then as at present, and every
good man depricated the misfortune which
obliged him to encreafe the taxes.
The war was a difagreeablc one, but
necessary, if peace could not otherwise be
obtained.
The legislature conjidered the expence,
and were of opinion, that we had means
and abilities to defray the fame.
Many muiders and ravages had been
committed by the savages on the fron-
tiersâone army had fuffered in the year
f 790, and nearly a wholp army cut off
on the 4-lh of November J79 1. And we
have every fcafon to ftippofe, that the In
dians would ast iti great force against us.
Our finances are still refpeftableâit is
true, I (hould be happy if we could apply
the money toward discharging the nation
al debt already contrasted, but the unfor
tunate situation of our frontiers prevent it.
Warâthough an evil, may (frpm the
present disposition of the world) be some
times neceflaiy, when nations are unrea
sonable, and justice cannot be otherwise
had. â 
Hostilities have lately been committqd,
on our tioops commanded b,y Major
dair, and several of the southern tribes
{hew thernfelves initnical, and we have no
abfolutc afluranees thatwe (hall have peace
in the fpiipgâThe agreement by some
tiibes to a fufpenlion of hoiUli[ies,was con-
venient to them, as it protested their fa-
milies for the winter.
If the great ohjedt of the additional ar
mament was to ob.ain peaceâthis is not
yet effedted, may we piomife ourselves
more fi;ccefs in negociation by laying
down our arms, or by retaining them ?
Hiltory is in favour of the latter.
Indetd I hold it as a maxim, that the
nation, which is prepared for war, can
jmolt easily obtain peace. For my own
part, lean discover no existing caufesfor
altering the fyllem eltablifhed by the ast,
to which I have before referred.
The cxpence has been made a vety feri
ousobjeftion: it ought tohave weight; but
where measures have been proper, Ame-
Rica has not regarded it. She has fieely
expended her treasure to support her
lights.
We are bonnd in justice and honour to
proteft our fellow-citizens on the frpn
tiers, we demand from them an excise-â
They require from the general govern-
ment protection.
1 am for making peace with all the In
dians upon reasonable terms; but any
country that has been fairly purchafcd
fiom the Indians, they (hould not be per
mitted to re-potfefs or hold by conquest.
If an ofFeufive war be necessary, fays
the gentleman from N. Carolina, regular
troops are not the mofl proper to carry it
oir. They' are more expensive and unfit
to meet the savages of the wilderntfs. As
to the expeiice I have partly answered be-
fore j but if the gentleman is to have five
expeditions in one year, I believe he would
find that his calculations are not coriett :
a misfortune to either detachments or par-
ty would bear very hard upon the diltrift
they came from ; the partial loss of tegu
lars, would not be equally felt, very few
of them having families.
I have a high opinion of the back-woods 1
riflemen, but I am confident that we can
not certainly rely upon fbeir turning out
as often as they might be wanted ; We
could not tely on such uncertainty, and
yet tftis offered as a favourite project.
If you cannot rely upon them, you may
fay that the ordinary militia can be draft
td, you would find them unfit for such a
service, they would in general be compos
ed of substitutes unexperienced and undis
ciplined, and it would be unfair to take
them all from the frontiers and some of
the Hates, or at lcalt one, have no militia
lawsâl am for retaining the regular
troops.
The President has pra&ifed oeconomy
in organizing the troops voted for, and I
am told they have made considerable pro
gress in discipline ; they are formed into
legionary corps, cotnpofed of horse, rifle
men, light-infantty, and battalion-men.
The three former will be fit for active ser
vice in the field, the latter for the com
mon duties of the camp or garrison. Ihe
printer miltook my expreifion the other
day in speaking of regular troops. Instead
of faying, there was no instance where re
gular troops had been beat by Indians ;
I mentioned " there was no in [lance dur
ing the late war where regular troops
were beat by anequal number of Indians."
I here repeat the fame observation.
I will allow volunteer? and militia their .
full credit; but I do not think the regu
lar troops merit the disparagement at
attemptedâVolunteer corps havenotbeen
free from misfortunes.
Colonel Crawford at the head of 500
volunteers from Virginia and Fennfylva
nia, was defeated in the wellern country, |
and he was burnt at the stake. General
Braddock, it is said, was obstinate, and
his Euiopean troops were undisciplined
sot such a service. The army under Ge
neral St. Clair was loft, because the men
were undisciplined and unfitted for tha
service.
I can mention fevetal instances where
regular troops have penetrated the Indi
an country, among warlike tribes, with
success: Colonel Montgomery into the
Cherokces ; Col. Armstrong to the
ICittanig; Colonel Boquet's campaign
of 1763 and 1,764. Three detachmeots
of the American army in the year 1778 ;
one under the command of Gen. Broad
head ; one under Lieut. Col. Butler, and
the last commanded by your humble fet
vÂ«nt, penetrated the country poffWTed by
the fix nations. Neither of the detachments
jwas large ; and the last had to contend
wgainlt superior numbers.
In Gen. Sullivan's campaign the year
follovvi .J, his van-guard beat an equal,
if not a superior number of Indians.
I might mention the Roman legions ;
they almost conllantly- were fuccefsful a
2 5 6
oainft those they called hathanans, untd
their enemies adopted tne Roman di.cip
-111 reprobate the idea of a Handing arrov
â¢vhieh "might endanger the l.bcrty of tan,
country ; but I consider th* troops con
templated in the a6t of Congress, to be
absolutely necessary until ptace ihall be
obtained : and therefore (hall vote againlt
a redu&ion.
Every ltep has been taken, and 1 date
fay will be pu.fued by thePrefident.to pro
cure a peace without bloodshed. Our
mcflengers of peace Tiave in some places
been murdered, and yet he has sent mel
fencers to others.
I have a high opinion of the personal
bravery and prowess of an Indian ; but I
do deny that they can aÂ£t to the belt ad
vantage in large bodies. They have not
an experience of that kind ; disciplined
troops would have the advantageâWhen
I speak of disciplined troops, I mean a
discipline fitted to the country and enemy
they are to aÂ£t again It.
