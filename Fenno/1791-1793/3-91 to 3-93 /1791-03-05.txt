I'he BANK BILL under conjideration.
MR. SEDGWICK said lie would cndeavournot
to fatigue the patience of the house 111 the
observations he fliould make on the important
fubjeJt now under consideration. Without en
tering into the difcuflion on a scale so extensive
as had been indulged by some gentlemenâhe
â¢would dwell only on a few important principles,
and fucb confeqtiences as were conclufiytly de
ducible from thein, which had made a ltrongiin
preilion on his own mind. The opposition to the
bill had called in queltion theconftituLional pow
ers of Congress, to eitablifh the proposed corpor
ation, and the utility of Banks, neither of which
till within a few days, did hefuppofe was doubt
ed by any intelligent man in America ; and had
charged the present system with holding out un
equal terms against the government tothofewho
should subscribe to the proposed flock.
With regard to the question of constitutionali
ty much had been said, which in his opinion, had
not an intimate relation to the fubjetft nosv before
the house. "We have with great earnestness
been warned of the dai ger of grasping power,
by conftruc f tion and implication ; and this warn
ing has been given, in very animated language,
by the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr. M.) Ido
not wilh to deprive that member of the honor of
consistency ; but I well remeinber_the-time. when
the energy of his reaC.nnrg. imprefied 011 the
miirds of a majority of this house, a cpnvitftion,
that the power of removal from offices, liolden
at will, was by conftrutfiion and implication, veil
ed, by the .constitution, in the Presidentâso
there could be no pretence that it was expressly
granted to him."
He said he would only observe in answer to
every thing which had been said of the danger
of extending conftrudUon and implication, That
the whole business of legislation, was a practical
conftruc r tion of the powers ofthe legislature ; and
that probably no instrument, for the delegation
of power, could be drawn with such p. ecilion and
accuracy, as to leave nothing to neccjfary implica
tion. That all the different legiflacures in the
United States had, and this in his opinion indis
pensably mult, conltrue the powers which had
been granted to them, and they mult aflume such
auxiliary powers, as are neceflarily implied in
those which are expressly granted. In doing
which,it was 110 doubt their duty, to be careful
not to exceed those limits within which it was in
tended they should be reftridied. By any other
limitation, said he, the government would be f>;
{hackled, that it would be incapable of operating
any ofthe effects which were intended by itsin
ftiturion,
He Ã¼bferved, that on almost all the great and
important measures which come under the deli
beration of Cotigrefs, there were immense dilTi
cnlties to be surmounted. "If we attempt,"
said he, " to proceed in one direction, our ears
are allailed v\iih the exclamation of the confiitution
is in danger ; if we attempt to attain our objects,
by pursuing a different course, we are told the
pals is guarded by the /tern spirit of democracy.â
Did I concur with gentlemen in opinion on this
subjeCt, Ifnould think it my duty to go home to
my constituents, and honestly declare to them,
that by their jealouly of power, they had so res
trained the operations of ihe government, that
we have not the means of effecting any of the
great purposes for which the onftitution was de
ftgnedâwithout attempting, what perhaps would
be found impracticable, to fix by general rules,
the nice point within which Congress would be
authorised to assume powers by con ft ru eft ion and
implication, and beyond which they may be justly
considered as usurpers."
He wished gentlemen to reflecfi, what effect a
lingle principle, universally acknowledged, would
have, in determining tlie question now under
consideration. It is universally agreed, That
â whtrs'jer a power is delegated, for express purposes,
Saturday. March 5, 1791.
ill the known and ttfua mjaus for the attainment oj
he obj.-lls exprcjfcd, are conceded also. 1 hat to de
-ide what influence (bis acknowledged principle
would have, on the fukjetfl before the house, it
would be neceilary to i eflect on tile powers with
which Cotigrefs are 'tprsfsly invelted. Pie then
epeited that Coiigrefs was authorised, to lay and
collect taxes, to borrow money on the credit of
lie United Stares, to raif? â  and support armies,
provide and maintain navies, to regulate foreign
and domestic trade, and to make all laws neceilary
:nd proper to carry these and the other cnume
ated powers into effect ; they were, in fine, en
t: ufted with the exercise of all those powers,
>vhich the people of America thought neceilary,
.o secure their fame and happiness, against the
attacks of internal violence, and external inva
lion, and in the exercise of those powers the le
j;i/lature was authorised, agreeably to the princi
ple which he had mentioned, to employ all the
ki/ovj/i and usual means, nectjfary and preptr> toes
fectuatethe ends which are exprefled. I: might
be of life to determine with arecifion, what was
the meaning of the words nectary and proper : â
They do not reftrid: the powrrofthe legislature,
to enacting such laws only, as are indifpenfible :
Such a confirmation would bf infinitely too nar
row and limnedâand to apply the meaning ftritfl
ly, it would prove, perhaps that all the laws,
which had been palled, wer? unconltirurional ;
for few, if any of them, could be proved indif
penfible to the exirtenceof tJiegovermnent. The
conduct of Congress had a con It ruction on those
words more rational, and consistent with common
sense, and the purposes for which the government
was instituted ; which he conceived to be, that
the laws should be eftablifherl on such principles
and such an agency, in the known and usual
means, employed in the execution of them, as to
effecft the ends expreflediti the confHtution, with
the great eft poflible degree of public utility. If
BanÃs were among the known and usual means,
to efFec'luare or facilitate the-Â»Â«<4Â»-Thictr had been
uiemiomnlâto enable the government with the
greatest ease, and least burden to the people, to
collect taxes, borrow money, regulate commerce,
raise and fu]>port armies, provide and maintain
fleets, he thought the argument irref agable and
conclusive to prove the conllitution lity of the
bill. Pursuing farther the fame idea, he alked,
for what purposes were Banksindituted and pa
tronized by governments, which were unreitri&-
ed by conltitutional limitations ? Were they not
employed as the means, and the mod ufeful en
gines to facilitate the collection of taxes, borrow
ing money, anAthe other enumerated powers ?
Besides, he was to be observed, that the
con dilution expressly declared the ends of
legislation ; but in almolt eveiy inttance had left
ihe means to the honest and lober discretion of
the legislature. From the nature of things this
must everbe the cafe ; for otherwise, the conlti
rution mult contain, not only all the necefl'ary
laws under the exiltingcircumftatices of the com
munity, but also a code so extensive, as to adapt
itfelf to all future pofli'ule contingencies. By our
conllitution, Congress has power to lay and coiled
taxes, but every thing subordinate to that end,
such as the objei'ts, the means, the instruments,
and the purposes are left to the honest and sober
Jifcretion of the legislature. The power of bor
rowing money was expressly granted ; hut all
he known andufual means totharend were lefi
in silence. The fame observations might with
truth be made refpecfiing the other delegated
powers. The great ends to be obtained, as means
ro effectuate the ultimate endâthe public good,
and general welfare, are capable, under general
erms, of conltitutional fpecification ; but the
subordinate means are so numerous, and capable
of such infinite variation, as to render an enume
ration impracticable, and innft t here fore be left to
c nflrufiicn, and ncc Jjary implication. He said 01
.his ground he was willing to Jeave the general
argument âit was simpleâintelligible, and he
hoped would be thought conclusive.
He said the conftirutionalitv hud been attack
ed from another quarter. It was said we could
not give commercial advantages to one port above
another. Theconftitutional provision which had
been quoted, was undoubtedly intended to pre
vent a partial regulation of commerce ; if ex
tended to the cafe under confederation, it would
much more ftro:iÂ«ly prove, that Congrefi ough
not to reside in any commercial ciiy ; sot he verily
believed, that the commercial advantages of Phi
ladelphia were incomparably greater, from the
769-
ttft&o
[Whole No. 195.]
i-efidence, than they could befuppofed from the
initiation of a National Bank. Indeed, it was
his opinion, that considering that this city had a
Bank, the capital of which was adequate to all
her commercial exigencies, that Ihe could enlarge
that capital as her necetfity Ihould require, and
that her Bank will, if this bill Ihall be rejeifted,
receive the benefit of national operations, that
the measure will not advance her individual in-
tereft
With regard to the utility of Banks, he obser
ved, that he would not attempt todifplaya know
ledge of the fubjeft, by repeating all lie had read
and heard in relation to it, nor fatigue the house
by a detail of his own reflections and reasoning
upon it ; the causes were unnCcedary to be ex
plainedâ the effetfis had been such, in all coun
tries where Banks had been instituted, as to pro
duce an unanimous opinion, that ihey were alike
ufeful for all the great purposes of government,
and to promote the general liappinelS ofihe peo*
pie. Nor was our own experience wanting to the
fame purpose. .At a time when our public re
sources were almost annihilated, our credit pros
trate, our government imbecile, and its patron
age inconsiderable, a Bank, of small capital, was
among the most operative causes, which produ
ced that firft dawn that ultimately terminated in
meridian splendor, by the ellabliftiment of peace,
independence and freedom. There were two
ciicumftances which he would take theliberty to
mention, which would render Banks of more
importance in this country, than in any where
they are at prefent'in use. The firft, the com
mercial enterprise of our merchants compared
with the (niallnefs of their capitals, which, as we
had no large manufacturing capitals, 1 whereby
the precious metals would be retained in circu
lation, would ft equently, by their exportation,
greatly dillrefs the people; the other originated
from a measure of the governmentâCongress,
from a laudable intention of accommodating
their condiments, instituted treafories in all the
Stares : In some ofthefe there would be, in the
ordinary course of events, a deficiency, and in
others a redundency. To keep them in equiii
brio by the transportation of the pi ecious metals,
or by the purchase of bills in the market, would
be not only inconvenient andexpenfive, but would
keep out of circulation a confiuerable part of the
medium of the country.
Gentlemen, he said, had been pleased to consi
der the proposed terms as giving an undue ad
vantage to the Hock-holders. He would leave this
part of the fubjecft to gentlemen who better un
derltood itâonly observing, that as government
tnuftrely principally on merchants to obtain the
proposed stock, ir would be neceflary to afford to
thein fufficient motives to withdraw from their
commercial put suits, a part of their capitals.
He said he would attempt an answer to some
of those desultory objections which had been
madeâand in doing this, he would omit to ans
wer such as had been in his opinion already refu
ted. He observed, that it had been said, that
granting charters of incorporation was a high,
pterogative ofgovernment. He supposed it was
not intended that it was, in the nature of things,
too tranfeendant a power to beexercifed by a na
tional government ; but that the exercile of it
(hould only be in consequence of express delegal
- Let this objection be compared with the
conduc't of Congress on another fubjetft, in all
i efpetfts at lead as important. There is not by
the constitution any power expressly delegated
to mortgage our revenues, and yet without any
qi eftion being made on the constitutionality of
the measure, we have mortgaged them to an im
mense amountâFrom whence he asked, do we
acquire the authority to exercise this power ?â
Not from express grants, but being empowered
to borrow money on the credit of the United
Mates. We have very properly considered the ,
pledging funds as among the known and vfual
means, nectary and piopcr to be em ployed for the
attainment of the end expressly delegated.
It had been said, that the bill auhorifed the
(lock-holders to purcliafe real estate. He consi
dered the provision in the bill in that regard,,
not a grant, but a limitation of power. Any man
or body of men, might, by theexifling laws, pur
diafe, in their private capacities, real eltaie to
nny amount. Tiiis 1 ight was limited asitief
pected the proposed corporation.
It is said there are banks already, and therefore
the proposed ii.corporation is unneceflary. To
this he anfwercd, that if the government fliouldagree to receive all its demands in the paper of
the existing banks, it would give to them every
advantage, which in the opinion of gentlemen,
renders the present fyltein objectionable, without
itipulai ing for any equivalent to t he gov e nun en t.
But are, he alked, gentlemen serious in theleob
fervations ! Do thby believe the capitals of the
present banks adequate to the exigencies of the
nation ? Do they believe that those banks pofiefs
any powers by which they can give a projeiftile
force to their paper, so as to extend its circulation
throughout the United States ? Or do they real
ly wish to have the government repose itfelf on
infiitutions, with which they have no intimate
connection, and over which they have no control ?
. Mr. Sedgwick concluded by observing, he was
â very confident a majority of that house could ne
ver be induced to believe that it was the inten
tion of the constitution to deprive the legislature
of one oftheinoft important and necefl'ary means
of executing the posveis expressly delegated.

PARIS, Dec. 7.
AMONGST the strongest instances of the fluc
tuation of popular opinion, may be reckon-
Ed the change of sentiment which has taken
place with refpedt to M. de la Fayette. At i
one time the idol of the people, he is now the I
objeift of suspicion with many ; and suspicion iiv
certain situations is nearly equivalent to hatred Jj
Of this the Marquis has experienced a recent
fiance.
He was attacked 011Tuefday 1 jft by 8 men arm
ed when accompanied by only 2 of his guards de 'i
corps.âThe latter were fortunately
pistols, by the discharge of which two of the af< 'â¢
failants were wounded. After a short contest,
these, with two others, were taken ; the reftfav
ed themselves by flight.
Aristocratic Finesse Defeated.
The late overflowing of the river* having in
many places in France, retarded the arrival of
the post', the Aridocratic Horde (as they are now
politely called) enjoyed the triumph ofamoment,
by giving out that the National Aflembly was dis
solved ; that Paris was given up to be plunder- ,
ed to the king's troops, and that all the patriots
who refufedlaying down their arms, were butch
ered 011 the spot. The people believed the re
port, -trot yielding to despair, or any
other unbecoming weakriefs, ihcy
repeated their civic oath, " to defend the conlti
tution until death !" In many places in Langue
doc the national cavalry were ready to fly to the
assistance of the capital ; their hangers were
whetted in the presence of the preachers of sla
very, who were given to underltand that, on the
fir ft signal of a counter-revolution, they should
be the vidtiins of national indignation.
The Municipality of Paris went on Thursday
to L'ifle des Cygnees, to fee a mill put in motion
by a fire pump ; it contains twelve mill-stones,
which in twenty-four hours, grind seven hundred
feptiers of corn ; [a feptier is twelve bulhels]
this curious piece of mechanism, will be found
wonderfully ufeful forfaris, as the Seine is fro
zen over every winter.
A new military body is established here, under
the appellation of the federal club ; the protec
tion afforded to it by M. de la Fayette, the service
the soldiers are employed in, beingat the Louvre,
give much food for conversation, and last week '
the whole was denounced at the Jacobins, as
nant with mifchief.
Virtue, modesty, and experience, will now oc
cupy in the French Church, the dignified places,

A LYRIC O D E.âFeb. 28.
FROM dreams I wake to real woe,
While winds from every quarter blow.
And urge the beating rain ;
111 leave my pillow, deep'd in tears,
And try to difiipate my cares
With my sweet lyre again.
Ah ! where is fancy's magic power,
That us'd to charm each dreary hour.
And gild the darked dorm ?
Ev'n in the howling of the wind,
Soft plaintive murmurs she could find,
Breath'd by some airy form !
Oft has (he borne me on her wing,
To climes that know eternal spring,
To sweet Arcadian vales ;
To where the vi'lets fragrant breath,
Perfumes unseen the defart heath,
With aromatic gales.
To groves whofedark embrowning (hades,
Skirted with evcr-verdant meads,
And woodbine mantled round ;
With dreams, whose velvet margins bear,
The blushing rose, and lilly fair,
Spontaneous on the ground,
Bat now no more her presence chears ;
Her wand no foft enchantment rears,
To sooth my heart-telt pain
How loud the tempests horrid loar,
I fee the wrecks on every ihore,
And hear the dying drain !
My mind congenial with the gloom,
That hides fair nature's brighted bloom,
Welcomes contending dorms;
Sad emblem of the griefs that prey,
And wade my widowed heart away,
In retrofpe&ive forms.

We may estimate the value of the national go
vernment by the lofles we hare fuifered for the
want of it. For want of a government, many
years of back interest are added to our debt, iu
cludiug the interest on the state debis, more than
20 millions of dollarsâPerhaps 30 have been in
arrears for interest only. Some will fay, perhaps,
that if we have paid no interest, we have paid no
taxesâand that we have laved by one way what
we have loft in another : So far from it, the coun
try bore a heavier burden before any hiHicienn
provision was made for its debts, than it has done
under the general government âthe taxes for
merly were higher, and yet the creditors were
fufferers. But it would be wrong to conlider the
taxes that we did not pay as so much laved.â
When the war ended, luxury came in upon us
like a torrent : Duties on imported goods would
have been rather a saving, than a loss : f roni
1783 to 1789 we might, if the new constitution
had been in operation duringthat time, have col
lected more than 20 millions of dollars by Impclfc
and Excise. That sum has been eat and drank, (
and as it regards the nation, may be conlidered
as mere loss. It is indeed worse than loft. For
duties not only encourage frugal habits, but they
encourage our own manufactures. Every dollar
of duty 011 foreign articles is a bounty to our
own. This bounty causes a great deal more
work to be doneâand work is money. If the
national government had been in full force at
the end of the war, instead of the year 1759,
our country would have Caved all these great
funis. If any are remaining among us who hate
the government, they will not fufter it to be sub
verted, if they love their money. Five years of
1 disorder would cost us more, than,2o years of hard
L work would pay for. It will take many years to
[wipe off the debt that the fix yeats of no govern
kment after the peace, have thrown upon the 11a
ltion. Experience ought to warn us againftanai
jchy, and those measures which are calculated to
restore it.

O.NSIDERIXG , tin icfoie, the uncn taint v of the fucccfs *
ihe expedient, and the inconveniences, which Seem incider
to it, it would appear preferable to submit to those of a free cain
age. It is obfervablc, that additional expence, which is one Oi
the principal of these, is also applicable to the proposed remedy
It is now proper to resume and finifh the answer to the fiift
queflion ; in order to which the ihree fuccceding ones have ne
cdTarily been anticipated. The conclusion to be drawn from the
observations, which have been made on the fubjeÂ£fc, is this
That the unit in the coins of the Unitecl States, ought to corres
pond with 24 grains and 3-4 of a grain of pure gold, and with
37 1 grains and 1-4 of a grain of pure silver, each answering to a
dollar in the money of account. The former is exa&ly agreea
able to the present value of gold, and the latter is within a small
ira&ion of the mean of the two last emiflions of dollars; the only
ones which are now found in common circulation, and of which
the newest is in the greatell abundance. The alloy i/i each cafe
to be 1-12 th of the total weight, which will make the unit 27
grains of jtandard gold, and 405 grains of standard-silver.
Each of these, it has been remarked, will answer to a dollar in
the money of account. It is conceived thatnoihing better can be
done in relation to this, than to pursue the track marked out by
the resolution of the Bih of August, 1786. This has been ap
proved abroad, as well as at home, and it is certain, that nothing
can be more Simple or convenient, than the decimal subdivisions.
rhere is every rcafon to expcÂ£l that the method will fpcedily grow
into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding
coins. On this plan, the unit in the money of account, will con
tinue to be, as established by that resolution, a dollar; and its
multiples, dimes, ccnts and milles ; or tenths, hundredths, and
thousandths.
Vls ich regard to the number of different pieccs which shall com
pose the coins of the United States,two things are to beconfulted :
convenience of circulation, and cheapness of the coinage. The
fiift ought not to be Sacrificed to the last ; but as tar as they can
be reconciled to each other, it is desirable to do it. Numerous
and small not too minute) fubd'vifi >ns aflifl circulation ; but
the multiplication of the smaller kinds expence; the
lame process being nect flary to a small as to a large piece.
As it is easy to add, it will be moil advifeable to begin with a
small number, till experience shall decide wh'e her any othei
k'nds are necefTary. The following, it is conceivcd, will be
Sufficient in the commeno njeni.
1 Goid pi tec, equal in weight and vaiqe to 10 units or dollars.
1 Gold piece, equal to a tenth part of former, and which
mall be a unit or a dollar.
1 Silver piece, which shall also be a unit or dollar.
1 Silver piece, which shall be in weight and value a tenth part
of the Silver unit or dollar.
1 Copper piccc, which shall be of the value of a hundredth part
of a dollar.
J Othercopper piece, which shall be half the value of the form r.
It is not propof d that the lightcft-of the two gold coins should
be numerous, as in large paymtnts, the larger the pieces, the shor
ter the proccfs of counting, the less the risk of mistake, and conse
quently the greater the fafery and the convenience ; and in small
payments, it is not pcrceived, that any inconvcnience can accrue,
irom an entire dependence on the silver and copper coins. The
chief inducement to the establishment of the small gold piece, js
to have a sensible object in that metal, as well as in silver, to ex
press the unit. Fifty thousand at a time in circulation, may fuf
fice tor this purpose.
The tenth part of a dollar is but a small piece, and with the aid
of the copper coins, will probably fuffifce for all the more minute
uses of circulation. It is less than the least of the silver coins now
in general currency in England.
I he largest copper piece will nearly answer to the half-penny
sterling, and the frnallefl of course to the farthing. Pieces of very
small value are a great accommodation, and the means of a bene
ficial economy to the poor ; by enabling them to purchase, in small
portions, and at a more reasonable rate, the neceH ries of which
they ftarid in need. If they are only cents, the lowijt price for
any portion of a vendible commodity, however inconlkierable in
quantity, will be a cent ; if there are half cents, it will be a half
cent ; and in a great number of cafe exa&ly the fame things will
be fold for a half ct nt, which if there were none would cost a cent.
lsut a half cent is low enough for the minimum of price. Exccl
five minuteness would defeat its object. To enable the poorer
cliflVs to pocuie neceffarics cheap, is to enable them with more
comfort to themfelvej, to labor for less ; the ad\antagcs of which
need no comment.
The denominations of the silver coir.s contained in the resolu
tion of the 8: h of Atiguft, 1786, are concciv d to be fignificant
and proper. The dollar is recommended by its correfpondenc)
"with the present coin ot thi;t name, for which it is designed to be
a substitute; which will facilitate its ready adoption as luch in the
minds of the citizens. The dime or tenth,the cent or hundredth,
the mille or thoulandih are proper, because they exprels the pro
portions which they are intended to designate. It is only to be
regret ed, that the meaning of these terms will not be familiar to
those v, ho are not acquainted with the language from which they
are bonowed. It woe to be wished, that the length, and in some
degree the clumsiness of some of the corresponding terms in Eng
lish, did not difcouiage Irom pr ferring them. It is ufetul to ha\e
names which fignify the things to which they belong; and, mre
fpccl to ohjefts of general use, in a manner intelligible to all. Per
haps it might be an improvement to let the dollar have the -
lation either of dollar or unit (which last will be the mofl fignifi-*'
cant) and to substitute " tenth" for dime. In time, the unit maj|
succeed to the dollar. The word cent being in tile fn various iraft
aflions and inftiuments, will, without much d fficulty, be under
stood as the hundredth; and the half cent of couifc as the two
hundredth part.
The eagle, is not a very expreflive or apt appellation for the
Jargt ft gold piece, but nothing b< tter Occurs. The fmallcft of the
gold coins may be called the dollar or unit, in common with the
silver piece, with which it coincides.
The volume or file of each piecc is a matter of more confe
rence than its denomination. It is evident, that the more {yc
perficies or furfaee, the more the piece will be liable to be
by frt&ion ; or, in other words, the faftcr it will wear. For this
reason, it is deferable to render the thickness in proportion to the
breadth, as great as may consist wi h neatnef* and good appear
ance. Hence the form of the double guinea, or double louis d'or,
is preferable to that of the half johannes, for the large gold piece.
The finall one cannot well be of any other size than the Portuguele
piece of eight, of the fame metal.
As it is of confluence to fortify the idea of the identity of the
dollar, it may be best to let the form and size of the new one, as
far as the quantity of matter (the alloy being less) permits, agree
â with the form and size of the present. The diameter may be the
feme.
The tenth may be in a mean between the Spanish 1-8 and 1-16
of a dollar.
The copper coins may be formed merely with a view to good
appearance, as any difference in the wearing, that can result from
difference of form, can be of little confrquenc'e in reference to that
metal. (To be concluded in our next.)

1 he design of this compilation was intimated to Congress, and
honored with their approbation.â On the 20th July, 1778, their
committee, to whom his memorial was referred, reported it as
iheir <J Opinion, that Mr. Hazard's undertaking is laudable and
deserves the public patronage and encouragement, as being pro
du6live of public utility;" Whereupon they Rcfoived, ThaÂ«
it be recommended to the Governors, Presidents, and Executive
Powers of the fcveral states in the union, to Mr.
give facility to his labors ; and that for this purpose he be admit
ted to an infpeftion of public records, and be furnifhed without
expenee with copies of such papt rs as he may judge will conduce
to the valuable end he hath in view.
He was, of confequenee, ad mitted to the infpe&ion and use both
of public records, and the collc&ions made by individuals, from
whence this compilation (much the largest he has ever met with
on the fubjeft, and, he flitters himfelf, the largest ever made in
America) was formed. It has finer met the approbation of many
eminent charafters,and even in its manuscript Â»state, has facilitated
the fettlemcnt of some important controversies.
