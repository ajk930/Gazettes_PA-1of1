CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY, March 8.
Debate ou the resolution reported by a filed commit
teeâThat the Secretary of the Treasury be direcl
edto report his opinion to the House, on the befl
mode of raising ihofe additional supplies "which the
public service may require for the current year.
MR. STEELE observed, that a motion to bring
forward a bill for repealing the law esta
blishing the treasury department, would afford a
proper opportunity for the display of that ora
tory which the House had been entertained with
yesterday and to-day.âBut on the present ecca
fion, he conceived the remarks werenot in point.
He observed that it was customary with thefirft
Congress, to make references of fubjecfts of this ns.
ture to the Secretary of the Treasury ; the pre
sent Congress has done the fameâand he had
heard of nothing that fuggells a fufficient reason
to deviate from the practice. All the reports
that have been received, have been attended to,
investigated, and scrutinized with a zeal and di
ligence, which have not marked the conduct of
the House on the reports from fele<3; committees
âHe is-ftanced several reports of the latter rle
fcription,to which little attention had been paid.
The independence of the Honfe has been mani
lefted in refpecft to reports from executive offi
cers, even from the highest ; and hetrufted that on
all occasions the House would continue to sup
port its independence of chara<fier. He fhoulcl
always rejoice in an opportunity to oppose eve
ry report from the heads of departments, when
his judgment did not approve of them.
>. He contrasted the present conduct of those op
posed to the motion, with their conduit on the
bill providing for the defence of the frontier*â
Every one who now opposes this proposition, was
in favor of almost aÂ« implicit adoption of the re
port from the Secretary of WarâHeoppofed that
report âbut these gentlemen now oppose the molt
obvious mode of devising ways and means to de
fray an enormous expence, brought on the coun
try by that very bill.
Mr. Murray oblerved, that on fiich a question,
his object should be to pursue what appeared to
him the wisest mode of raising taxesâln agreeing
however with the resolution and its reference,
he could neither fee danger in the precedent,
nor surrender of confticutional right in the con
sequencesâAs to the privilege of originating mo
ney-billsâWhen waysand ineansareto be fought
for, his firft objecfl should be to gain all the in
formation the delicacy of the cafe demanded
The duty of exploring the resources of a coun
try, as yet untried in many of its objedts of tax
ation, was certainly the buflnefs of the House of
Representativesâbut why they should refufe to
themselves an opportunity of gaining additional
knowledge, beyond what the leisure of any one
here, or the abilities of few could collecft, was
extraordinaryâHe wished for a reference to the
Secretary in the firft instance, because it would
not very well comport with the dignity of the
House to refer to him in the fccond
If on trial, there {hould appear either a crudity
or a confliaingoffyftems j and if, as would moil
probably be the cafe, partiality in the mover of
any undebated set of resolutions, should fliow it
felf, the House must either make the mod of the
plans proposed, or in the very last resort, rail on
the officer of government to suggest his opinion
on the fubjetftâThe fubjetf: was extremely in
tricateâBut part of the intricacy of taxation and
finance was removed, by the well arranged order
in which he prefuined the documents relative to
the department were preserved.â An ad of Con
gress has already delineated the duties of the va
rious departmentsâT o the Secretary of the Trea
sury it belonged to colledi information refpeiting
the objects of taxationâTo invent or adopt anil
propose schemes, by which the revenues were to
be improvedâ to digest ideas on the political e
conomy of the country, and to superintend its
financesâln such a department, he must think
that a mass of information existed on the various
resources of this country, and their probable pro
duftivenefs, which was not necefl'arily to be ex
pected elsewhereâHe wished to avail himfelf of
this information, on which he would exercise his
right of judging, altering or rejeifting ; and he
wished to obtain it in the mode most congenial
â¢with his own n.ind, an open refpoufible commit-'
r.ication to the whole House.âHe was certain
that, though in no habits of intimacy* himfelf
that coultl juftify a private communication with
the Secretary, nor warrant from the Secretary
an unsolicited opinion to him, the opinions and
ideas of the Secretary would, in fonie way or o
ther most alfuredly find their way into the Hotife
âHe wished to fee 110 minilterial out door influ
enceâThe wholesome influence offuperior judg
ment and of well digested opinion, he did not
fear ; on the contrary, that superiority was the
only one to which he could bow ; and the only
way in which the unmixed benefit of such an in
fluence can be felt, was that way in which the
law refpedting the heads of departments contem
plated the fubjedt.âFrom this mode of commu
nicating all the knowledge of the treasury de
partment, two benefits would be derivedâThe
Secretary would fend to us his best opinions on
the fubjetfi, and in a way of which the whole
House and the public itfelfcould avail themselves
in forming a judgmentâand private influence,
partially, and irresponsibly given to individu
al members, would be rendered useless.âHe beg
ged leave to remark that the objection to this
mode, that the power and right was in the House
of Representatives to originate money-bills,could
not have much weightâThe House of Repre
sentatives of right, and by the constitution were
properly constituted the sole origin of money
billsâBut this reference does not deny the right,
nor can it weaken its operationâA bill does not
originate till the House has agreed to some prin
ciples or resolutions ; or a committee reports a
bill by order :âprinciples then eltablifhed by
vote, resolutions, or leavt, are the only ways in
which, in a legillative sense, any thing can be
known to this government to originate in the work
of legislationâHe who has not a feat here, of
whom for the fake of multiplied information we
require controulable opinion, does no more ori
ginate the legislative work of the House, than the
author of a work on finance, from whose opini
ons we form a scheme of revenue, can be said to
tax the people. There is certainly this good at
tending a reference in such casesâa greater
chance for simplicity in the fyftein of finance,
and greater (labilityâThe opinions thus obtain
ed, are not obligatory farther than as they ap
pear founded in wisdomâwe can alter, add, cr
rejetflâa complete controul is in our power.âlt
is thus we shall unite the efficiency and regulari
ty which are the only good parts of bad govern
ments, with the controul and right of reiecfiion
which belong to the most free. Gentlemen, af
ter all, will not be precluded from furnilhing the
house with the result of their individual labors,
and talents.âSome gentlemen had agreed, that
if a committee were to submit a plan to the House,
that committee might obtain all the intelligence
neceffiry from the SecretaryâThis would, he
thought, be better than obtaining information
secretly by individuals ; but would be very ob
jedfionable, and attended with this inconveni
ence that the opinions of the Secretary on which
the committee might make their report, would
be but partially known to the House, and would
come into it unaccompanied by the higti refpon
flbility which an official report from the officer
made in the face of the world, would give them
He said he would vote for the leference, be
cause he wished, on so tender a fubjetft as that of
taxation, to have all possible information be
cause he felt his right to rejedt opinions to which
he might not be able to subscribe ; and because
he thought the House too delicate to obtain of
ficial information in any other mode than that
in which they might rightfully exert their im
partial judgments in its admiifion or rejection.
Mr. findleyâl objedt to the resolution for
calling upon the Secretary to report upon the
ways and meansâas contrary to the principles
of the government, and inconsistent with the pu
rity and independence of the House of Repre
sentatives, whose duty it is exclusively to prepare
or originate revenue laws.
I consider this mode as a transfer of legislative
authorityâlt is a serious qtiei'.ion, if legislative
authority can be transferee! by the constitutional
representatives of the peopleâif it can how far !
It any part of the constitutional legislative trust
C r'i trans^ may not all or any part there
of be so ? The opinion 1 have received, and in
which I am firmly perfuadea, is that the legifla
rui e, nor any branch thereof, can do any part of
legislation by proxyâThe members only are re-
Iponfible for the discharge of that trust ; they
are the official judges of the principles and ob
jects of legislation.
â¢ Â£ Houie of Representatives are peculiarly
intruded with the authority of digelling fifcal ar
rangements and principles ; of faying what (hall
e a fubjecfl of taxation, to what amount, and the
uses to which it (hall be appliedâThis power is
luppofed by the constitution of the United States
and by the constitutions of most or all of the se
parate dates, to be a most important and influ
ential part of legiflmive authority; hence the
senates, though they are alio the people's repre
sentatives, are in other relpetfs vested with equal
egifiative authority, are not permitted to prepare
revenue systems ; their attempting to do it,would
ie an unc onftituiional usurpation of legislative
power. 6

which has been ian&ioned by Congrewp and it
now about to be repeated by "the refutation b*
fore you, I consider as a method of originati*
money-bills highly improper in itfelf, and
hath a dangerous tendency.
But a worthy member (I believe Mr. Ames)
informs us, iu defence of the resolution, that the
Secretary can prepare a revenue system w i t (,
more consistency with ref'pec r t to the txilfin<T re .
venue laws, and better calculated to support pub
lie creditâthat it will pais with greater facility
through the Houseâ that the members are une.
qual to the bufinefsâtlnu the members do not
potTefs fufficient information to enable them to
originate the businessâthat the Secretary only
is poflefled of the information competent "to itâ
that we can judge of his systems when they are
laid before usâas there will be always fonie to
find out his defects and expose them. All ( h e fe
arguments refpetSing the incompetency of the
members for the business, and the fuperiorfitnefs
of the Secretary, apply against the government
itfelf ; if the constitution vests this House with a
trull which it is not qualified to discharge, it is
time to change it, and adopt a more fimpleform.
It is much better to have a minister responsible
to the people for the revenue systems theyintro
duce, that to have his responsibility loft 'in the
legislatureâis the members of this Houfeareon
]y to give a fanftion to the minister's fylleins, it
is better to dispense with that fandion. I have
no doubt but that the Secretary of the Treafurv
is very capable of discharging this duty ; and if
he was a member of this House, would not fay
he was unfit far his part of that trullâbut this is
not the place for panegyricâThe minider's emi
nent abilities or his want of them, is all one to
me on this fubjetft.âThe modelly of gentlemen
who declare themselves unfit, is not very honor
able to the House, nor easy to be credited.âLet
tne House fix its own principles, judge for them
selves <?f the proper sources of revenue, and of
the !>fes to which it ought to be applied ; and
capacity and information will grow out of the
investigationâif the members differ in opinion,
as may be expedted, they will propose different
systems ; and by comparison and discussion they
will become the better acquainted with the fub
jectâlf the members stand in need of that in
formation which arises from the operation of ex
isting laws, or of the efficiency of operating re
venuesâthe President has a conffitutional power
to call upon the heads of departments for that
information, and communicate it to the legisla
ture ; and the House, by its own authority, has
a right to call for information from any officer
or department, upon any fubjecft respecting which
it may originate lawsâthis is a power incidental
to iegiflation.âBut with refpe<ft to the general
interests of the community, the knowledge of
which mull grow out of a reprefentauon of all
the local interests, this can only be found among
the members of this Houseâand if the represent
ation was more numerous and more equal, that
kind of information would be still more perfect
âCertainly this House contains in itfelf more ex
tensive knowledge of the people's wants and
pressures, of their situation and prepollelfions,
and of their refburces, than the moil enlightened
minister can possibly do ; especially when it is
considered that all the documents locked up in
the minister's office is at their command âthe
pra&ice of the House in depending on the mi
nister for to originate principles, and to furnifh
the House with volumes ot arguments in favor
of those principlesâand the custom of membets
having recourse to those arguments as authorities,
has done more to dishonor Congress and le'leii
the members in the public efteenÂ»,fince the change
of the government, than any other part of their
conduit. How can Congress be reipeiftable, if
they spend long felfions at a great expense on the
molt influential parts of legislation, only to gi* =
a fancftion to ministerial fyllems ; or at beftonl/
to criticile and corretft them.

A PARAGRAPHIST in the Gazette of the
-tk United States, whose remarks have been
copied into some of the public prints, would
gravely persuade us that those who write against

' a dozen persons!' It is well he is candid enough
to allow there are even twelve honeil men in
America, who still preach up found dodtrine
But it is alked, whether the apoltles of the con

From the dull famenef3 of the style, it may be
presumed, that small indeed is the number of
those worthy gentlemen,who employ their leaden
pens in eking out those drowsy fulfome panegy

begins to smoke, and the high-fliers themfelvcs

By accounts from Georgia, it appears that the Indian line,

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
" In the day of prosperity rejoiceâin the day of adversity
consider"âis a divine injunction : when peace succeeded and
crowncd the glorious contest for liberty and independence, the
people of the United States gave an unbounded scope to their im
agination ; and from anticipating an uninterrupted series of pros
perity they plunged into scenes of luxury and extravagance but
the triumph of folly was (hortâdebts public and piivate soon
brought us to sober reflection ; the result was the adoption of the
new fyflem of governmentâ(ince the creation, a greater cfiange
for the belter, was never known in the circumstances of any peo
ple ; and so far from being an imputation on the government, or
itsadminiftration, are the few clouds at the present moment
flitting in the Iky of our political horizon, that when the fun
of reason shall have dissipated them, our public prosperity will
through their intervention be more permanently established.
The present however is considered by the enemies of our fede
ral union as a favorable opportunity to promote their views and
if the people can be brought to believe that their senses deceive
them, and that those who build up and preserve are their enemies,
and that those whose talents extend no further than to full down
and destroy are the only patriots of the country âour profpetU
will be evanescent indeed.
When it shall become criminal to support the government
which the people establishâwhen those who traduce and ma
lign that government (hall be considered as friends to the people
âwhen those who diileminate principles subversive of public
honor and private faithâand by anticipating the public judgment,
preclude a fair investigation of truth, palm themselves on the peo
ple as patriotsâwhen the foundations of virtue are attacked by
reprefeniations which tend to deltroy all refpeft for character pro
feffions and abilities, by blending in one undiftinguilhed masÂ»
knaves, rogues and honed menâwhen such is the state of things
in any community, the harvest of the sons of anarchy and rapine
If foreign nations had not an higher opinion of the Government
of the United States than certain persons among ourselves, whoaf
fume to themselves (with what propriety, time will fliew) the name
of patriots, we might solicit loans to eternity without effect.
The demon of slander broke loose last summerâbut being
frowned upon by a discerning public, he retreated to his den;
where, for the honour of our country, and human nature, it w.is
to be hoped he would have reposed in silence and oblivionâbuc
some restless, envious spirit, has disturbed his repofc; and the
fiend having broken his chain, has commenced his woik of lieÂ»
and detraction in an attack on certain personages, with (it is
lhrewdly fufpefted) the laudable defignof fubveiting the attach
ment of the people to the Union and government of the Hates, by
fowir.g divisions among those who adminider our affairs, and
thereby rendenng them odious to the people. May the nefari
ous dcfigns be blalted.
There are some men who pretend to love their country better
than themselves; but they hate every thing done to promote its
happinels that is not of their own proje&ing.

a tra& of wood-Jand of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly pait being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the said street 011 the east, and by the nver on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combmcd etfed of fim
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the molt
beautiful and desirable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-finifhcd brick building, 50 by 40, corttaining four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding a very extenlive and plcafmg vitw.oE

den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich collection of the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large asparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man-
Gon-houfe, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well

spring-house, garden, See. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne

most approved grass. This square has produced annually, for fe
vera! years past, upwards of lixty tons of the best hay, beftdt
supporting through the summer season twenty to thirty hornci
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains alio two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper season?
with great phnty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frefti watt
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both of whic!
