FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FENN'O,
I AM a plain farmer ; and as the winterevenings
are long, I love to gee the city papers and to
con over the affairs of the nation. My own af
fairs go very well ; wheat has fold very well
since the new government began, the crops have
been good, and I find since the debt has inade
such a suss 1 get the ready cacti better than ever,
for cafli is grown plenty. Thus I am quite at
leisure to inind what does not more concern'me
than another man. I have a family, however,and
I look forward to futurity as I ought. No body
will wonder then that 1 am a deep politician.
I have read the city papers til! the cold sweat
ran down my faceâl never sweated more at the
plow. I read about the danger that our repub
lican principles are exposed to, and how nionied
men are growing up to the lize of Goliah, and
how Congress is all wrong, and how we are too
rich now to be virtuous and free, tho t'other day
we were too poor to pay for a government, and
then the charge of it would take our bread away,
and our children would cry for a crust. 1 love
my family as well as a bird loves her nest, and
my children as well as she loves her young. I
had rather secure to them a good education and
a free government, than to learn them to dance
and leave behind me a great estate. I have been
led into an hundred scrapes by thinking too well
of my own opinion, and so fays I, I will fee how
the wind is with my neighbors, far we live migh
ty well together. A dozen of us got together on
new year's evening, and then we talked all these
matters over.
If we had drinked small-beer, it would be a
short story to tell you all that palled, but as small
beer would not go down, we were all very talk
ativeâ we did not drink to excels however. in
stead of telling you all that was said, it will be
fufficient to tell you what was finally agreed to.
The funding fyftetn was at firft condemned as
very improper, and anti-republican â but after
mature enquiry it was allowed that it was a very
good thing. What does that promise, said we,
more than to pay ourjuft debtsâDebts contract
ed to make the lands we live on our own, and to
remove a stranger and intruder from them.
Tho we pay at 20s. in the pound, as some com
plain, we had the value at that time when the
debt was contracted, and now we have the bene
fit more than twenty fold, having beaten our e
nemies, and being let down to enjoy pcace and
security under a free government. If then we
owe the debt, what harm to promise to pay it.
The funding fyftein acknowledges the debt, and
engages to pay the interest quarterly. Something
was to be done with the debtâCongiefs must ei
ther pay the principal of ihedebtat once, orpay
the interest yearly by annual grams, or fund it
as they have done, or take ihe fpuiige and rub
it out. When we blame Congress for the way
they have pursued, it is but fair 10 fee what o
ther ways lay open for them. We should not
have thanked Congress to call for a direCt tax to
pay off the debtat once. We had not the money.
Such a great demand would have cruflied us, and
it is out of the queltion.â Had Congress forborne
to fund the debt, it would ha. e been a better
speculating I'cheine than it is now. The more
uncertaiu from year to year, the better for the
357
ifc,
[Whole No. 295.]
{peculators. They would have (peculated oti
the chance chat the interelt would not be voted
for at the year's end. Who would have been
the gainers by this uncertainty. Not the farm
ers. The money would have been drawn to the
seaports, where this icheme of yearly grants for
the interelt would have opened' the molt profita
ble market for money. Therefore few would
have engaged in the improvements or purchale
of lands. And the debt itfelf, tlio always em
ploying money, would not have taken the place
of money as it has done ot late. Another very
bad conference has been told us, that foreign
ers would have got the certificates for a trifle.
It is true they have bought them (ince the debt
was funded, but we have got into the country
245. or 255. for evet y 20s. We receive more than
we give, and it is 110 c easy to fee how the coun
try can he made poor by making good bargains.
Why then (hould we not fund the debt at once.
We mean to pay itâwhere was the harm of fay
jng so. rh ela II method of d 1 fpofi ng of the debt
was to blot it out.âSome peopie think that would
be throwing off a weight they are tired of car
rying on their backs. Now, | teach my children
the ten commandments. I endeavorto bringthem
up to be honest menâand I (hould be miserable
it 1 forefaw that they would be brought to shame
for their misdeeds. â 1 (hould truly be afraid of
their turning out rogues in spite of my care, if
Congress had agreed to fpunge out the debt.
Government, by /hewing what advantage is to
be got by dilhonefty, would do a great deal to
wards (polling all the youth in the land. There
fore, if the devil tempted Congress to jockey the
public creditors, 1 am glad for my children's fake
they did not yield to him.
Some have found fault because the whole debt
cannot be redeemed at pleasure. Where is the
harm of that, pray ! We have taken a ftouc slice
from the creditors on that account ; atid have
we parted with any very valuable rights ? Have
we not rei'erved.the right to redeem as much of
the debt as we have money to pay off. And what
a rout is kept up in the liewfpapers, because we
have parted with the right to do what wecannot
do. And yet we have been well paid for parting
with the right by the funding fyftetn, i. e* by
the 3 per cents and deferred debt.
This is alledged to be dangerous to a republi
can people. There may be a snake in the grafSj
but 1 cannot fee how a people expose theinfelve*
by a<fting according to good conscience. We owe
the debt, and we ought to pay it as soon as we
can. I cannot for my life fee what there is anti
republican in purl'uing the plain old path of com
mon honesty.
As to the fiddle-faddle story of the great na*
bobs becoming lords, I feel quite at my eai'e.
They must leave off getting childrenâotherwile
half a dozen or halfa fcoreyoung fellows in each
family, will be found to have a greater inheri
tance in folly and luxury than in 6 per cents.
And what care we, the lords of the foil, for the
fix per cent gentry. Their wealth gives them
no power over usâand as to their number and
influence, they will afFecft llie price of pheafanis
and v enifoil more than the votes of Ihe yeomanry.
The country is in the hands of the landed in
tereltâ which outweighs as much as it outnum
bers the monied inteieft. The latter has ever
been as a drop in the bucket : â and though it ha#
intreafed of late very unexpectedly, the landed
interest has not increased lessâand it is going on
with a speed and to an extent that mocks the filly
apprehensions of the monied interest eating ic
up. Look round and fee how the frontier circle
widensâfee how the interior part improvesâ
fee how arts and manufactures multiplyâA man
who stands 011 a wharf, fees none of this won
derful growth of the landed interestâhe fees the
growth of trade, which indeed flows from the
growth of the country produceâhe fees the mer
chants and rich people scattering handfulls of
money for luxuries, and he is ready to cry out
that the newspapers are in the right to found the
alarm for liberty ; and lb he snatches his pen and
ink to tell us how we afe made beggars by grow
ing rich, and all slaves by honest and equal laws.
But the landed interest governs every country â
and as in this men live on their own farms, and
are not tenants, nothing is more certain than
that the people may govern if they will. Liberty
is not exposed to any new danger by the new
monied interest, as the public creditors are term
ed by the angry newspaper writers, 0n thecontrary, it is plain that these men will !ofe more
than ether citizens by the dell ruction of th*
common libertyâsos their property v is m;ide to
depend wholly, 60 the Jawsâtheir policy is to
keep all quiet, not to change the government, as
many inlhiuate. It would be a <|ueer blunder
for a man os-six per cent, to join in a ploi against
a free government, which pays him his income.
Liberty, therefore,, has gained new friends ra
ther than foes by the funding fyfteinâwhofe liv
ings are made to depend 011 their support of the
prefect free and equal fyllem of laws.
On tile'whole, no country ever gained more
credit, wealth and power, in three year's time,
than this has dbne since the newgoverninent be
gau. If the newspapers are full of charges a
gainst the government whicii has chiefly produc-'
ed this wonderful changeâat the very moment
when the change is fretli in our minds, and if
they are capable of souring the people against it
in theprofperousoutletâWhat will happen when
tniilakes or disasters, incident to all governments,
shall have destroyed its popularity ?âlt will be
limb from limb, unless the body of the-peo
ple, who form its solid support, lhall be willing;
to pcoteft it agaiult its artful and implacable
enemies.âOf all its friends, the farmers (lioiild
be the-firmeft; for Congress lays 110 land-taxes,
and yet things go on very wellâtoo well, fay
the newspapers.âAnd whether it encourages
manufa&urers to eat the proviHons at home, or
navigation-to seek a market abroad, we are sure
of the benefit. Opprellion will make a wife man
mad. If only talking about oppreflion when
there is none, will make a man mad, I will fay
lie is not a wife man. A FARMKR.

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
FRIDAY, February 3, 1792.
In committee of the whole, on the Fishery Bill.
THE ftift fediion being read as follows : â
" Be it enadled, &c. That the bounty, now
allowed upon the exportation of dried filli of the
lifheries of the United States, (hall cease 011 all
dried fifh exported after the tenth day of June
next ; and in lieu thereof, and for the more im
mediateencouragement of the laid fifheries, there
Jhall be afterwards paid, on the last day of De
cember, annually, to the owner of every veflel,
or his agent, by the collector of the district where
such veflel may belong, that shall be qualified
agreeably to law, for carrying on the Bank and
other Cod Fisheries, and that (hall actually have
been employed therein at sea, for the term of
four months at least, of the fifhing season next
preceding (which season is accounted to be from
the last day of February, to the lalt clay of No
vember in every year) for each and every ton of
such vessel's burthen, according to her admea
surement, as licensed or enrolledâif of twenty
tons and not exceeding thirty tons, one and a
half dollars, and if above thirty tons, two and a
half dollars, of which bounty three eighth parts
fliall accrue and belong to the owner of fucli (idl
ing veflel, and the other five eighths thereof fliall
be divided by him, his agent or lawful represen
tative, to and among the several fifliermen who
shall have been employed in such veflel, during
the season aforefaid, or a part thereof, as the cafe
may be, in such proportions as the fifh they shall
refpeAively have taken may bear to the whole
quantity of fifh taken on board such veflel during
such season. Provided, that the bounty, to be aH
lowed and paid 011 any veii'cl for one season, shall
not exceed 1 70 dollars."
Mr. Giles expredeH some doubt refpectino- the
principle of the bill ; and for the purpol'e of col
]e<fting the (enfe of the committee on the Hibie<fl
lie thought the nu.ft effectual means would he
motion to amend the hill, by striking out the
whole fcction.
He accordingly made the motionâobfervinp
at the fame time, that he could not positively as
iert, whether the reasons which determined him
againlt the principle of the bill, were weil found
ed or not ; that, in matters where a local pie
i erence .s given, it is neceilary to accommodate â¢
and he would be happy if his objections could be
removed.
1 he present section of the bill (he continued)
appears to contain a direct bounty on occupa
tions: and if that be its object, it' is the firft at
tempt as yet made by this government to exec
c.fe luch authority sâand its conftitutionalitv
"ruck him in a doubtful point of view; for in
n'o pars of the conftitntion could he, in'exprefs
terms, find a power given to Congress to errant
bounties on occupations the power is nelth"-
directly granted, nor (by any reasonable eon
lhuc'tion that he could give) annexed to any
other power fpetified in the conltitution. It
might perhaps bajferoughc in under a mode ot
conltruction al&eitdy adopted by the house, viz.
that, of " ways and ends by which any power
whatever might be equally implied :â'ouc he
wilhed ever to fee some connexion between a ipe
cified power, and-the means adopted for carrying
it into execution.
There is a great difference between givjngen
couragement, and granting a direct bounty.â
Congress have a right to regulate commerce ; â
and any advantage thereby reftihing to a parti
cular occupation cynneifted with commerce,conies
within that authority : but when a bounty is pro
posed to a particular employment or occupation,
this is llepping beyond the circle of commerce ;
and such a measure will affect the whole manu
facturing and agricultural lyftem. Iji all cases,
the revenue, to be employed in this bounty, is
drawn from all the sources of revenue in the U
nited States, and confined to a particular object.
He was averse to bounties in altnoft'every shape,
as derogations from the common right; and lie
thought there would be 110 great difficulty in
proving that a government is both unjust and
oppreilive in establishing exclusive rights, mono
polies, &c. without some very substantial merit
in the persons to whom they are granted ; altho'
even in that cafe the propriety of such grants is
still questionable.
Under a just and equal government, every in
dividual is entitled to protection in the enjoy
ment of the whole produtfl of his labor, except
filth portion of it as is neceifary to enable govern
ment to protect the reft; this is given only in
conlideration of the protection offered. In every
bounty, exclusive right, or monopoly, govern
ment violates the ftiptilation oil her part : for,
by such a regulation, the produift of one man's
labor is transferred to lhe life and enjoyment of
another. The exercise of such a right on the
part of government can be jultified upon no other
principle, than that the whole produift of the la
bor of every individual is the real property 01
government, and may be dillributed among the
several parts of the community by governmental
discretion ; such a supposition would diretitly in
volve the idea, that every individual in thecam
m unity is merely a slave and bondman to govern
ment, who, although he may labor, is not to ex
poet protection in the product of his labor. An
authority given to any government to exercise
such a principle, would lead to a complete fyftein
oftyranny.
He entertained fewer doubts, refpeifling the
principle, as it regards political economy. All
occupations that Hand in need of bounties, in
dead of increasing the real wealth of" a country,
rather tend to lellen it ; the real wealth of every
country confiding in the active product of ufeful
labor employed in it:âit is therefore bad policy
to encourage any occupation, that would dimi
nish indead of increasing the aggregate wealth
of the community :âand if an occupation is real
ly productive, and augments the general wealth,
bounties are unneceflary for its support; for
when it reimburses the capital emplo'ved, and
yields a profit besides, it may be said to support
itfelf : â when it fails in tbefe points, any forced
advantage, that is given to it by the government,
only tends to decrease the wealth of the country!
. The fubjecfl however might (he observed) be
considered in a more favorable point of view
and that is, whether the provision be efiential to
the defence of the United States, and whether
the bounties proposed in the bill were more than
equivalent to the portion of defence that would
be procured by them.âThe bill does not (in his
opinion) contain that kind of encouragement
which is efiential to the national defence. Any
man, who takes a view of this country, mud be
convinced, that its real support lifes from the
land, and not from the sea ; and the opposite
nulla!, e mud have arisen merely from a servile
imitation of the conduct of Great.Britain : the
inhabitants of this country heretofore thought
favorably of her government, and the revolu
tion has not yet altered their former ideas .e
---fpetfling it.
Rut the cireninftan<?es of the two countries
Will, Oil examination, be found widely different â¢
Britain, surrounded by ,he sea on every fide'
finds a navy necefiary to support he, comme.ce â¢
whilst America, poflefled of an immense territo-'
y, and having yet ample room to cultivate that
e.ritoiy, has no occalion to contend L-y sea with
any European power :-her flrengthand her re
iourcesare alll to be found within the United
States ; and if she but attends to her internal ,e
sources, the objea of national defence wiil be
much better answered.
I3e next proceeded to consider whether that
pornon of the national defence which ,ni"h be
denved from the fineries, wâ u ]d not hep^chaf
338
portatxon of the iifhj and the
ed on the tonnage of the fifhirigvefl<?ls t the i recÂ»ii
be no comparative value between tire drawback
and the bounty ; they have âo neceflary relation
to each other; and the latter may exceed the
former, or the former exceed the latter.âHe had
made a calculation, and upon the molt favorable
principles, grounded on the reports of the
cretary of the Treasury and the Sccretarv o(
State. 'â¢
Here he produced a calculation, rending to
fiiew that the propol'ed bounty on the tonnageof
the veiieis, would conlideiablyexceedtlie
amount of the present draw-backs from a com
parison between the bouury, and the number of
sailors employed in the fifheries, he ihewed,what
an expense each man would be to :he s United
Statesâand, after other remarks, observed, that
even Great-Britain,whofe whole national support
and defence depends 011 her navy, had fotmd
that the men employed in the fiflieries, though
so neceflary for that defence, coil her too much >
âthat America, whose consequence, as a nation
does not depend on a navy, ought to 'ake ales'
son from the experience ofHritain thathedii
not willi to enter into a competition with Britain
and France, in supplying the different markets
with fifh ; that, as those nations are able to liol4
out greater encouragement to their filhermen
than we can to ours, we would, by fucti a conj.'
petition, only exhaust the treasury of the United
States to no purpole : and Upon this principle
alone, he thought there wasfoiiiereafontodotfk Â«
the policy of the measure proposed in the ftfli
-011 under consideration, which therefore be jiop
ed the committee would agree to 'itrike out oil
lefs his objections could be obviated.
Mr. Murray obfervcd, that in orderto demon
strate the propriety of the measure, it would be
incumbent on the friends of the bill, firft, to
prove that tlie fifhery trade.is in a state ofdecay,
that the stock employed in it does not yield the
ordinary profits, so as to-jnftify ihe merchants in
embarking their capital in thi's branch of trade,
â-that theie is a fyflem of defence in contempla
tion, which tlie circumliauces of the country call
for, and which this trade is calculated tofurniflj,
âthat other branches of trade, which do not
(land in need of encouragement, are not equally
capable oi iurnifliing seamen for tlie purpose,
that this particular object so peculiarly claims
the attention and encouragement of the United
States, as to leave tar behind every coitfideration
of the manufacturing interest, the agricultural,
&c. all this he thought neceflary for gentleman
to prove, and to shew (ome very itroiig necellity
for encouraging one particular class of men, in
preference to all others.
Mr. Goodhue.âlt happens, that the filheries
of the United States are alinoft entirely confined
to the Hate of Maflachufetts ; and they fnrnifit
a considerable, a principal portion of oar export
trade. As we are a part of the United States,
the United Siates in general are interested in
the profpericy of that branch of business, so iar
at lenft as it contributes to ihe national defence:
âit furnifhes a copious nuiTery of hardy (earner,
and off ers a never-failing source of protection 10
the commerce of the United States. If" we en
gage in a war witli any European power, those
seamen will be excluded from their ordinary em
ployment, and inuft have recour'e to privateer
ing. During the late war with Britain, we an
noyed tile enemy more in that line, than all o
thers ; and had ii not been for privateering, it
would often have been iuipoffible to keep toge
ther our armies, who frequently in tlie hour of
need, were supplied by the privateers with am
mution and cloathing, of which they were whol
ly aeftitute. All jliat we vvifh to ob ain by this
bill, is that we may not be burdened with du
ties. An opinion has been entertained, that no
drawbacks ought to be allowed on there-export
ation of articles imported from foreign coun
tries : hut if this opinion were to obtain in prac
tice, and no drawbacks were to be admitted, we
in 11 ft confine our importation to articles for our
own confuinption.
1 lie drawback, allowed by the exiftinglaw,oii
the exportation of fait fi(h, was calculated to be
only equal to the duty beforehand paid on the
quantity of falc tiled in curing the fiih : but
fifhernien complain, that, as the acs now (lands,
they are wholly excluded from any participation
in the benefit, which centers entirely in tlie cof
fers of the merchants : â the objecft of the present
bill, is only to repay the fame money into the
hands of thole persons who are)mincdiately con
cerned in catching the fifh ; and there can no
reasonable objection be made to fuel) a transfer
of the drawback, as government will not lose a ,
single dollar by the change. The gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Giles) talks of the unconfii
tutiona'it y of granting bounties : but no bounty
is required :â we only ask, in anotherniode, tlie
nlual drawback for the fait, iifed on the filh
if we can make* it appear that the bill does not
contemplate any greater funis to be drawn from
the treasury, than are already allowed, it is 10
be hoped that no further opposition will be madeto the meafnre :âand that this ii really the cafe,
can be proved by documents from the treasury
office
Here he read a statement, and calculation to
prove his afl'ertiou ; and to Ihew, that die United
States will probably pay one thousand dollars
per annum less in the proposed bounties oil the
tonnage of the fifhing veflels, than they would in
the drawbacks oil the exportation of the filh.
The filhermen, he continued, are now under
no coniroul : and in consequence of this want of
a proper restraint, they often take whims into
their heads, and quit the veflels during the Hill
ing season. To prevent the inconveniences of
this pradlice, the bill contemplates their exclnfi
-011 from the bounty, unless they enter into such
contracts and regulations, as may be found ne
cessary for the proper and fuccefstul conducfting
of the business, which, from our advantageous
lunation would be entirely in our hands, if we
did noc meet with fucli opposition and difcou
rageinent from foreign nations, whose bounties
to their own fifhermen, together with the duties
laid upon our fifh, would, to persons less advan
tageously fituatcd than us, amount almost to a
total prohibition.
In the report from the Secretary of State, a
drawback is contemplated of the duties on all
foreign articles, used by the seamen employed
in the tiftiing trade, such as coffee, rum, &c. &c.
âbut we ask it, on the fait alone ; nor is it ask
ed as a bounty, but merely as a transfer from the
hand of the merchant to that of the fifhernian.
Mr. White had no objection to give the trade
a proper degree of encouragement ; but he did
not relish the idea of granting bounties if any
gentleman would prepare an amendment, so as
to make them drawbacks in fadi as well as in
words, he would consent to the measure.

WEDNESDAY, February ij.
The bill (from the senate) relative to the elec
tion of a President and Vice-President, See. was
read a third time, and pafled, with the amend
ments
A bill (received yesterday from the Senate) for
regulating proceHes in the courts of the United
States, and providing conipenfations for the offi
cers of the said courts, and for jurors and wit
nefies, was read, ordered"to be printed, and re
ferred to a feletft committee, to examine & report.
âThe committee appointed are Meflrs. Boudi
not, Smith (N.H.) Smith (S. C.) White and
Benfon.
Mr. W. Smith called for a second reading of
a memorial, some time since presented, from sun
dry inhabitants of the State of South Carolina,
who were engaged in commerce, previous to the
late revolution, praying relief from the incon
veniences, under which they labor, in confe
rence of having been obliged to receive pay
ments in depreciated paper currency, and to
pay their Britifti creditors in specie. The me
morial was referred (fine dieJ to a committee of
the whole house on the (late of the union.
The House then resolved itfelf into a commit
tee of the whole (Mr. \V. Smith in the Chair)
on the representation bill.
The question being taken on a motion to fub
ftirute the fir ft day of Ocftober 1792, instead of
the 41b of March 1793, as the period for an en
creal'e in the representationâit palled in the ne
gative.
A motion was then made by Mr. Vining, to
apportion the representatives as follows:âNew-
HampQiire, j members; Maflachufetts, 16; Ver
mont, 3 ; Rhode-lfland, 2; Connecticut, 8; New-
York, ir ; New-Jersey, 6; Pennsylvania, 14 ;
Delaware, 2 ; Maryland, 9 ; Virginia, 21 ; Ken
tucky, 2 ; North-Carolina, 12 ; Georgia, 2.
After a short time spent in difcufling the pro
position, the committee rose and reported pro
g'efs. Adj6urned.
THURSDAY, February 16
Mr. Grove laid on the table a resolution for
the appointment of a committee to bring in a
bill for building a light-house on Bald Head, at
the mouth of Cape Fear River, in the state of
Nprth-Carolina.
Mr. Macon laid on the table a resolution, that
the Comptroller of the Treasury be directed to
lay before the House a statement of the balances
remaining unpaid, which may have been due by
individuals to the United States, previous to the
4ih day of March i 789 ; and to inform the House
whether any and what fleps have been taken to
lecover the fame; and also to furnifh a llate
inent of lundry funis of public money entrulVed.
Â«o individuals previous to the said 4th of March,
J 759, and not yet accounted for.
1 lie House resolved itfelf into a committee of
the whole, on the representation bill Mr. W.
Smith in the chair.
After some debate on Mr. Vining's motion for
5 representatives to the llate of New-
IJampfhire, &c.
Mr. Jjenfoii (with the consent of Mr. Vining,
w iio withdrew his motion for the purpose) pro
pofcj an amendment, to make the firft section
read as follows :
Be ic enacted, See. tiiat from and after the
3d day of March, in the year one ihoufand leven
hundred and ninety-three, the Hotife of Rcpre
fentatives (hall be coinpofed of " a number of
members equal 10 the quotient of the whole num
ber of persons in the Hates included in this union,
divided by 30,000, which members shall there
fore be" elected within the several ltates, ac
cording to the following apportionment, that is
to fayâwithin the itate of New-Hamplhire, &c.
This motion gave rife to further debate, in
which the arguments heretofore ui'ed in the dif
ctfffion of the former representation bill, were
again brought forward. The coniiitution was
frequently quoted ; âthole paflages in that in
strument relating to the apportionment of re
presentation and direct taxation, were explained,
commented on, and counter-explained ; every
different interpretation, that the ingenuity of
man could pollibly affix to the words, was given
to them. The question however being taken on
Mr. Benfon's motion, put an end to the debate,
and it pafied in the negativeâYeas 24, Nays 33.
The committee then rose and reported pro
gress. Adjourned.
FRIDAY, February 17
A memorial of P. L. Morell, on Indian affairs,
was read, and laid 011 the table.
Sundry petitions were read and refered.
In committee of the whole 011 the representa

York 11, New-Jersey 5, Pejinfylvania 14, Dela
ware 1, Maryland 9, Virginia 21, Kentucky 2,
North-Carolina 11, Georgia 2.
An ainendmenc moved by Mr. Murray, dating
the principle of the apportionment of the repre
sentation to the several states, was adopted.
It was then moved to flrike out the second fec
tiou, which provides for an enumeration previ
ous to the expiration of 10 years, which was ne-
gatived
The committee then rose and reported progress.
Mr Venable presented the petition of Natha
niel Guestâwhich was read and refered to the
Secretary of War.
Mr. White's motion, laid on the table some
days since, was called up and agreed to, viz.

House, that whenever any confidential commu
nications are received from tlie President of the
United States, the House shall be cleared of all

so continue during reading such communications
and all debates consequent thereonâAlso, when
any member fliall have any communication to
make which requires secrecy, the House shall be
cleared in like manner, &c.
Adjourned till Monday.
LONDON, December 7,
A contrail for thirty thousand arirtocratical
regimentals is now executing in Greek-street ;
but it is not probable they will be ltained with
Democratic blood till the spring meeting 011
Champ de Mars !
A f.milar contradt for fire arms is executing at
Birmingham. The order is for 25,000 Hand,
and they are supposed to be for the use of the
army of the French Princes.
That death should be an ariflocrat seems rather
extraordinary :âwe rather take the grim tyrant
to be a furious democrat who levels all diftinc
tions, and pays very little refpeft even to the
Grand Monarch !
A very curious comment is made in one of yes
terday's papers, on enlilting men in this country
to serve in the army of the French Princes.â
The writer calls this an outrage, but at the fame
time confefl'es that making and felling 25,000
(land of arms in Birmingham, for those Princes,
is no outrage at all.âPray of what use would
the men be without arms ?
Philadelphia, February 18.
Died, at Annapolis, on the 10th inft, his Excellency George
Plater, Governor of Maryland, aged 56 years.
A resolution is now before the Senate of this Commonwealth,
for inftruÂ£tinÂ£ their Senators in Congress to use their influence that
the debates of the Senate may be public.
Sixty real estates in the city of Ncw-Yoik are advertised for
sale in one paper of last week.
Thus by bank magic we behold
The lands transmuted into gold;
That gold will soon get paper,wingsâ
The reitâwhen time revealsâhe lings.
The accounts of French affairs, received by the last packet, are
very contradi&oryâThe emigrants from France are at Coblentz.
There, it :s laid, an army is forming, and that the number is ra
pidly increasing ; that money and its confcquent attendants abound
their. Other accounts fay that the emigrants are dellitute even
of the neceilarits of lifeâthat Coblentz is the general rt fort of
every species of wretchedness and misery. The King's brothers
have aulwered his letters, m which they avow their attachment to
his pcifqn and character, but refufe to return.
339
The decree lately psfTed against the emigrants has been returned
to the Allembly wuh ilns affixed 10 itâThe King wi Uu ,
minkâthe formula of the Royal Negative. On which M Cam"
bon, a member of the assembly, made the following , av D em
nent remarks: Â° ' F 1
1 he King, ' said M. Camfion, il in affixing his negative, has
exercised his right. Let us refpeÂ£l his motives without enquiring
into them. Let us relpect the proof which he has given to Eu
rope, of the freedom which he poffefles, in the midst of his peo
ple : and let us fee noihing in the use he has made of the autiv.
niy entrusted to him, but a new pioof of his attachment to the
Conltitutjon."
A torrent of applause followed this fpecch.
P ,:oc ' ama "Â°", reflecting the emigrants, has bten
publiflied by older of the King.
The northern and middle States are fnppofed to be alone favor,
able to manufa&ures. This opinion has fcemed tote well found
ea ; but it has been prov'd of late that manufa&ures dttually ex
ilt in the foiiLhern States to a very refpedabte extent. The pro
greis of the arts towards perfection cannot fail to produce a more
than proportional increase to the fouthwardâfor as machines are
more and more brought into, use, it will be found that exienfivc
manufactories will fuccetd best in the neighborhood of the great
iuples or raw materials. Coal and all other fuel abounds most
at the louthward ; hemp is cheapest thereâthe carriage is expen
iive, the markets distant; cotton may be produced in abundance â¢
provifious are cheap ; excellent streams of water are frequent :
Many other advantages are poirefl"ed by the southern States, and it
cannot considered as an overfanguinc cxpe&ation to fee capital
manufactories flouiifh among them.
THE POWERS OF GOVERNMENT.
1 HE powers of Congress and the States,
That deathless source of learn'd debates,
turnifhâfo public clamor teaches,
An endless fund for pop'lar speeches ;
Three years the pleating peal has rung,
From many a bell with leathern tongue ;
1 he sticklers for the States don't flinch,
And Congress cannot gain an inch :
Thus in a circle always moving,
Arguing, proving, and disproving,
We're whirling round from year to year,
And always found just as we wereâ
Was cv( r such a blcfTed scheme
That furnifh'd an immortal themeâ
For if we can't get rid of doubt,
Nor point the powers of Congress out ;
Th' entire buf'nefsof the nation
Is brought about by usurpation.

ANDREW MILLER,
â ^t e P4 w ]Â«FROM A LATE HALIFAX PAPER.
ExlraÃ from the Proceedings of the venerable Society
Jor propagating the Go/pel in Jortigu parts.
" TN the lait year's abftradt it was mentioned,
1 that Mi". James Frafer was gone attendant
upon the Negroes to Sierra Leona, with an al
lowance of 50 guineas from the Society.
" That experiment had turned out very con
trary to the expectations of those who were in
duced from the belt motives to plan and encou
rage it. Mr. Frazer's health has been so mucli
injured by the undertaking, that he was con
strained to retufn home ; and though n> an y
months have elapsed since, he has not yet found
the blefling of a perfect reitoration. While he
was there he wrote two letters to the Society, ot
the refpedtive dates of July 22 and September 15,
178? : In the former he expresses his concern,
that there was no likelihood of a permanent fet
tleinent, from a variety of causes, some of them
unavoidable, and others unfortunate. They had
the misfortune to arrive just at the commence
ment ot the rainy season, so that the blacks could
neither build comfortable huts lor their fecui ity,
nor raise grain to supply provisions when their
allowance from government should be exhaulted.
The unhealthinefs too of the climate added great
ly to their misfortunes. This proved tatal to
Mr. Irwin, their conductor, the fchool-malter,
and 20 other white people, and 30 blacks ; be
sides, that 140 died in the voyage : and of the
330 persons then remaining, there were no less
than 150011 the lick lift. This had so prejudiced
the blacks, that many of them then proposed to
work their palTage to the Weft-Indies, after their
provision should be expended, which would not
last more than five or fix weeks. In the second
letter he said that the condition ot things was
â very little altered ; their number was diminished ;
the whites were still sickly, and the blacks, tho
healthier, were still far from being reconciled
to the place, or attentive to the cultivation of
their lots of land ; that they had sown little or
jlo feed, had built few comfortable houses for
themselves, nor any house for Mr. Frazer, or tor
public worship, and that they were very little
disposed to remain in the settlement. Soon after
this, he came home in a very ill state of health."
