S I R,
IF the tiling] that occur in the praSice of husbandry calruHtrd
to ttitow light upon any particular branch of that bulinels,
y/cre in general made public, it would doubtlrfs be ol great uti
lity ; in that way farmers may mutually aid and alBIl each other;
and miy, not only find their lahor in many refpeds maj- easier
but learn bow to apply it 10 much better purpolc ; if the foilow-
Hige*jÂ»eÂ»imÂ«WÂ«Â»ndobfervatioiis (hould be thought to be calcu
lated to promote that valuable purpose, or, any part of them, they
'are at your service.
Considering the great qoantittesof potatoes that are raised in the
province, * appeared 10 me of considerable cOÃteqoeuce to have
it determined, whether for feed or culture
Large potatoes, or smallâwhole potatoes, or cuttingsâthe
whole potatoes cut up, or the eyes only cut outâlarge cuttings, or
smallâearly planting, or lateâfew hoeings, or manyâwere best?
âTo try to cast {owe ligtot ispon these queries, the follow rag ex
perimenls have been made in the course of the two tail fcafons.
Ii may here be observed with refpeft to all the following experi
ments, that land was chosen as near alike as could conveuieutly be ;
and dunged alike by measure :
For the (juery, the potatoes taken for teed, weighed,
ThÂ« firfl fee, si Â«z. each.
The second J oz
The third 3 to an 07.
The fiift and second fizc were cut into near as m:ny pieces as there
were eyes; the third were planted whole and the fame experi
ment was repeated the lad year m two different places, and again
this year, extept that the second fire was tried [Ms year only.
The Â«verage of aJI the fcveral trials together, is as follows :
Firfl size, H7lbs.
S cond do. 110 *0 oz.
Third do. 106 8 ditto
The third fiw, being three potatoes to an ounce were, doubtless
as small or smaller than people in genera! take pains to gather, and
though not equal to either of the forgoing, yet ii appears by the
above experiments, rhat they will do to plant when larger cannot
be had. .
For the second query, trials were made in two places, and wub
two kinds of potatoes in each, viz. potatoes weighing ounces,
ar.d others 3to an ounce. The largcft size had generally four
teen or fifteen eyes in each poratoc, which when cut up is enough
for two hills, and in (hat way I planted them ; wherÂ« the large
whole potatoes were planted I put one in each bill; where the
cutting were planted, I made one of these large potatoes serve
for two hills, saving halt the feed ; and hills where the cuttings
were, had about the fame number of (talks as the other : Thrs
mav 'seem strange but I have lound it to be true in other inttances;
when potatoes are cut into as many picces as there arc eyes, every
eye will commonly vegetate, and I have known fume of them put
out more than one stalk. On the other hand, when a potatoeis
planted whole, frequently not more than one half of the eyes ve-
grtatc.
" The average weight of an equal number of hills each, was as
foilous :
Whole potatoes, 82lbs. 13 oz.
Hatt rhe fame number cut up, 85 do. g do.
Those that were three to an ounce, were put three whole ones in a
hill and half the fame quantity of those that were cut; they yielded
The whole potatoes, 75 lt>s - 17 oz -
The cut. ditto, 63 do. 12 do.
The last part of this experiment (hews, that potatoes so small as
3 to an ounce, are hurt much by cutting ; but the produce of the
(mall ones, that were planted whole, in this experiment, was in
nearly the fame proportion with the produce of the latge ones in
it; is that of the small ones to the large ones in the foregoing
exoeriment, and serves, together with that, to (hew thit tHe rela.
live value o? such small potatoes, a. three to an ounce -when com
oated with those that weigh 3A ounces each, is nearly as 10 to 11 ;
and thia difference will be considerably diminilhed, wtien it is
confidercd, that it does not take moie than halt so many bufheis
of the small ones to feed an acre as it does of latge ones ;a! that
they are but of little value, compared vinth the others, (or any
other purpose than thai of feed.

MR. FENKO,
READING the newspapers, I perceive that our public offi
cers are called knaves arid enemies of liberty. The mea
sures of government are represented not only in the papers by
paragraph writers, but by the (beech-makers in as
the worll that any country ever fuffered to be execute J.â

cPMt&o
Whole No. 51 2.]
Now, I agreed to this rcvr con ft i tut ion. T have often felt
pleasure ii> feeing; a new face on things since it was adoptedâ
and my neighbours, who were rather a* iirft thought inclined
to be antis, acknowledge that the success of the government
has been greater than they expected, and infteail of heavy di
re<st taxes, they fay that the farmers are peculiarly intereiied
in Aipoorting the government, as it has not ailVlled them to
pay the intereit money to the creditorsâon the contrary, the
taxos encourage the sale of our produce;
But they tell us that the beads of the ./departments are very
bad men. If so, they were bad men before they were aopoint
edâarid how came the President to trufl such bad iiieu with
power. But the man who has in every a&ion of hi" life mani
fefted his love of his country, is not to be supposed to have
made choice of very bad men in this internee. Judging of
them bv their appointer, and by their works, I fay, as an in
dividual, I place my confidence in the government and the
heads of its departments.âBy their fruits ye shall know them.
If they go on as they have begun, every true-hearted Ameri
can will fay, and in his prayers too, " go on and prosper."
FOR THE GAZFTTt Of THE UfiiTF.l) STATES.
ON THE NATIONAL MONUMENT,
Dt frgnrd to perpetuate American Libertyâwhich it
has been proposed to employ Mr. CERACCHI, the
celebrated Roman Sculptor, to execute.
AS works of this kind depend for their appro
bation on sentiment, there is no use in rea
soning about thent. An attempt to vindicate this
public work, will be unfuccefsful, unlels more is
felt than can be said. The gratitude of a nati
on, the fame of its hero, the sympathy that is
indulged by the free when they join to comme
morate the event that has made them so, and
when they give to posterity an admonition in
marble, to prelerve inviolate in every future age,
the precious inheritance which the prefe:u lias
obtained for tliemâthefe are emotions which
cannot, by reasoning, be either fubdutd or awak
ened.
The precedent of such expence is feared. But
what does it commemorate âthe birth of our
nation, which cannot happen again. What other
event can have equal pretenllons ? â or, if one
equally impoitant fliould occur, who could deny
that its nature would make a precedent ?
The proper reward of virtue is gratitude.
The afFetflionare admiration of a whole people,
is the only adequate return for the signal merit:
of the man in whom it is concentered. Tafle
and genius will chiflel this sentiment in the rock,
and make it indelible. Will not these means of
Augmenting the recompence of virtue contribute,
iu the molt powerful manner, and in all future
times, to excite it ? And if this work should
flimulate the emulation of future heroes and
patriots, what could more fuccelsfully promote
the cause of libertyâof our countryâ-of man
kind ! Even to the fordid foul that cnu prefer
gold to virtue, it will seem to be good economy
to bear the expence of a work which will tend
to raise up another WASHINGTON. And let
him who doubts this tendency read the hidory
of aniient GreeceâWhat a fuccellion of patriots
and heroes served, and for centuries laved that
illustrious people ! The mind, weary and de
jected with the recital of human vice and misery,
is cheered by this contemplation.
If modern Greece that rears no monuments,
and yet is not left iinpoveriflied than debasedâ
which is the burial ground rather of the living
than the dead, for the living sleep in lilence and
darkness and oblivion, unconscious of their an
celtry ; while those whose graves they tread on,
by their glory still live and fill and govern the
earthâif Greece could rekindle a single spark
of the genius of her progenitors, is there one of
the nation so degenerate, whose foul has been so
much the victim of Turkilh brotality, that he
would not prize his country's honors beyond any
other inheritance ?
These are reasons to shew the tendency to in
cite and to reward pre-eminent virtue. Butfome
care ftiould be taken to secure what it has ob
tained. Such a monument ofliberty will make
it sacred. The law of the Ten Tables was ou
brass, and rufl has corroded themâLet the De
calogue ofliberty be engraved on the unperifh
abie marble. ESTO PERPETUA.

PHILADELPHIA
THE following communications, from the Pre
sident of the United States, were read in the
House of ReprefentatiTes on Friday the 13th inib.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
House oj Representatives,
I HAVE thought it proper to lay before you,
a communication of the 1 ith inll. from the mi
nister plenipotentiary of Great-Britain, to the
secretary of state, relative to the commerce of
the two countries ; together with their explana
tory correspondence, and the secretary of state's
letter to me on the fub}e<S.
April 13, T792.
SIR,
I HAVE the honor to lay before you a com
munication from Mr. Hammond, minister pleni
potentiary of his Britannic majesty, covering a
clause of a statute of that country relative to its
commerce with this ; and notifying a detertni
nation to carry it into execution henceforward.â
Conceiving that the determination announced
could not be really meant as extensively as the
words import, I asked and received an explana
tion from the minister, as exprafled in the letter
and answer herein enclosed ; and, on considera
tion of all circumstances, 1 cannot but confide in
the opinion exprefled by him, that its sole ohje(ft
is to exclude foreign veflels froin the iflatids of
Jersey and Guernsey.
The want of proportion between the motives
exprefled and the measure, its magnitude and
consequences, total tilence as to the proclamati
on on which the intercourse between the two
countries has hitherto hung, and of which, in
this broad sense, it would be a revocation, and
the recent manifeftations of the disposition of
that government, to concur with this in mutual
offices of friendfhip and good will, support his
conftrmfiion.
The minister moreover aflured me verbally,
that he would immediately write to his court for
an explanation, and in the mean time is of opi
nion, that the usual intercourse of commerce be
tween the two countries (Jersey and Guernsey
excepted) need not be suspended.
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the
nioft profound relpedt and attachment, Sir,
Your nioft obedient and most humble servant,
TH. JEFFERSON.
The President of the United States.
Sir,
I HAVE received by a circular dispatch from
my court, directions to inform this government,
that, conlklerablc inconveniencies having arisen
from the importation of tobacco in foreign ves
sels into the ports of his majesty's dominions,
contrary to the a<a of the 12th Charles 2. chap.
tB. l'ecfl. 3. (commonly called the navigation adt)
it has been determined in future (Vrictly to en
force this clause, of which 1 take the liberty of
enclosing to you a copy ; and 1 have the honor
to be, with perfect esteem and respect, Sir,
Your molt obedient humble servant,
(Signed) GEO. HAMMOND.

AND it is further enacted by the authority a
foicfaid, That no goods or commodities whatfo-
C p ei L^e growth, production, or manufacture
ps Africa, Alia, or America, or of any pari there
of, which are described or laid down in the nfu
al maps or charts of tbofe places, be imported
into England, Ireland, or Wales, islands of
Guernsey and Jersey, or town of Berwick upon
Tweed, in any other ship or ships, vellel or ves
sels, vvhatfoever, but in such as do truly and with
out fraud, belong only to the people of England
or Ireland, Dominion of Wales, or town of Ber
wick upon Tweed, or of the lands, islands, plan
tations or territories in Asia, Africa or America
to his majesty belonging, as the proprietors and
right owners thereof, and whereof the matter
and three-fourths at least of the mariners are
hngl.fl!, under the penalty of the forfeiture of
all inch goods and commodities, and of the fhiÂ»
or vellel in which they were imported, with all
ler guns, tackle, furniture, ammunition and ap

Phihddphia, April ir, 1792
Sir,
I AM this moment favored with theletteryou
did me the honor of writing yesterday, covering
the extract of a 3riiifh llatute forbidding the ad
niifiiun of foreign vefl'els into any ports ot che Bri
tifli dominions,with goods or commodities of the
growth, production, or manufacture of America.
The effect of this appears to me so extensive,
as to induce a don be whether I un<lerftand right
ly the determination to enforce it, which yon no
tify, and to oblige me to alfc of you, whether we
are to consider it a 9 so far a revocation of the
proclamation of yonr government, regulating
the commerce between the two countries, and
that henceforth no articles of the growth, pro
du<siion, or manufacture of the United States,
are to be received in the ports of Great-Britain,
or Ireland, in veflels belonging to the citizens of
the United States ?
I have the honor to be, with fentiinents of the
most perfe<fl esteem and refpeft, Sir,
Your mod obedient fcid inoft humble servant,
TH. JEFFERSON.
The minister plenipotentiary of Great-Britain.
Sir,
IN answer to your letter of this day, I have the
honor of observing, that I have no other instruc
tions upon the (Ã¼bjetfl of my communication, than
such as are contained in the circular dispatch, of
which I Hated the purport in my letter dated
yesterday. I have, however, 110 difficulty in as
suring you, that the result of my personal con
vitftion is, that the determination of his majesty's
government to enforce the clause of the at'i of
navigation (a copy of which I transmitted to you)
with refpetft to the importation of commodities
in foreign veflels, has originated in consequence
of the many frauds that have taken place in the
importation of tobacco into his majesty's domi
nions, in foreign veflels, and is not intended to
militate against the proclamation, or order of
the king in council, regulating the commercial
intercourse between Great-Britain and the Unit
ed States, which I have every reason to believe
(till exists in full force, as I have not had the
most distant intimation of its being revoked.
I have the honor to be, with the moll perfedi
efteein and consideration, Sir,
Your molt obedient humble servant,

to the o'-rjefhons which I have already made and heard a-ainft

protection of the frontiers, but for the encouragement of cer
tain manufactures, and of the fifiieries, and for the encreafe
of the finking fundâit is a bill very different from what it
ought to be, and is about to pass, f.om what has fallen from

PITTSBURGH, April 14.
On Sunday the ift of April, two lads were
miffing from the waters of Whelen, and three
parties in a fliort time went in pursuit of them.
One party, the firft out, had crofled the Ohio,
and were on the opposite bank at the place where
the Indians intended to cross, at the fame time
the Indians had reached the river, and our peo
ple were unfortunately discovered by them. The
Indians fled down the river. Capt. at this
time (the second party) was about halfamile in
the rearj and the third party lower do'wiv .the
river. Coining up to the place which, tjie Indi
ans left when discovered, found they had toma
hawked and scalped the.two boys, and also haid
tomahawked on the left fjdeof the head another
lad which they had taken, but had not been
â¢nifledâthey had scalped him and cut his throat,
but so high under the chin as not to be mortal,
and chough he will lose an eye, will recover.
This lad had ccme to liimftlf, and left the place
where he was wounded in this desperate manner
ljefore our people came up, and had got upon
<otte of the hories which the Indians had stolen,
and which they were obliged to quit, and had
rotle three miles into Grave Creek 'fenlemenr.
On Wedneiday following, a woman was .killed
and scalped near Mr. Brice's meeting house,
within two hundred yards of the great road
leading from Wafliingion to Whelen, and with
in J J miles of the fettlement.âJn consequence
of the above information, Absalom Baird, Esq.
lieutenant of Washington county, has ordered
out a party of militia.

Yeftcrday the Vice-President of the United States and his Lady

By a gentleman lately arrived here, we learn, that General
Bowles, who has figured some time past as an Indian Chief, is
now on his way to visit Old Spain. He had commenced his
paflage from New Orleans Â®n board a government cutter, attend
ed by a military cfcort.
It is prcfunied that he may have some accounts to fettle in
Spain refpefting goods that lve has taken from certain (lores in
Florida, without the consent of the owners.
The Bank of New-York have declared a dividend of 4 per

A very elegant Clock has lately been completed at the Clock
Manufactory in Roxbury (Massachusetts) which is no more than
the common height and size of an eight-day Clock, and will run a

John Baker, Reynold Keen, and Jonathan B. Smith, Esquires,

Prefentmtnts of the Grand Jury of Wilkes county, in Georgia,

A pair of extraordinary fine cattlc were fold in our market on
Saturday last. The largest of them was a five-year-old, and fed
but one season. He was publicly weighed by Mr. Fisher, the

To expedite bufmefs in repairing the ftrects, a large plough
on a particular conftru&ion has been fuccefsfully employed in

We are informed by the Mate of the ship Citizen, arrived
at this port from St. Andero, that three sailors, one by the
name of Jackson, and the other by the name of ChurcWell,
the other name unknown, who failed from Philadelphia the
12th December last, in the Teresa, lloderiguez, bound to
Spain, were to be executed in a few days, for having murder
ed the Captain and crew of the said brig, and endeavoring to
go off, were dete&ed in thÂ« 6ay of Biicay, and brought into
St. Andero.
4i The queen being in a very ill state of health has sent the
enclosed decree to the Tribunals, the Prince continuing the
public business, and signing all State papers in her name. We
are all very much affe&ed at the situation of so good a sove
reign, the dilorder having attacked her head so that ihe has
loft the right use of her lenses."
The admin iftration of public affairs having devolved upon
me by the notorious difabiiity of our Lady the Queen, and the
phy 11 clans having declared that all application to public buli
nefs would be injurious to her health. Yielding therefore to
circumstances and unavoidable neceflity, and to the will of
the said Queen, which has opportunely been made known, I
resolved to attend in Council and sign public dispatches in her
name, without* making any alteration in the accustomed forms,
so long as the said impediment fhaU last, or until she fhaU be
pleased to order it otherwise.
There are sentiments advanced now-a-days which those
who utter them would be forrv fliouldhave their full force and
operation on the public mind.âWhy then are they brought
Forward ?âThere are several answers which might be given
âbut let this admonition fuffice âit is dangerous to sport on
a precipice.

WEEP, weep ye muses ! over Dashwoods's herfe,
Pay the fad tribute of a mournful tear;
Melpomene assist the farrowing verse,
That flows for him whom mem'ry still holds dear.
Tho' genius mark'd him for a fav'rite son,
And science blefs'd him with her richest lore;
Yet ah ! alas ! their profpe&s were undone,
By fate who robb'd them of the promifs'd (tore.
Soon as the youth attained to manly age,
E'er koary time impaired the youthful bloom ;
Insatiate death hurl'd the dire bolt of rage,
And laid him peaceful in the silent tomb.
In climes far distant from his natal lhore,
In the fair dawn of life, he fainting dies ;
His heart hard panting hove a parting groan,
And mourning strangers clos'd his dying eyes.
Light lay the turf upon his fdent head,
Green be the sward that shrouds the dust below j
Around his grave let pityiug tears be shed,
Till the dry'd source forbid them more to flow.

THE editor of this publication hopes, from the eltabhfhed re
nutation ot the several tracts of which it is composed, that
ir will be found a more complete fyftfem for the inftru&ion of the
female world, than perhaps ar.v other extant.
A voUime, under the prcfent title, was lately published in Eng
land and Ireland, and had a mod rapid sale. having been niiichafed
bv almost every lady of taste in those kingdoms. To this volume
the editor has added Miss More's-EifaysâMrs. Chapone's letters
on the government of the temperâand Swift's letter to a young
ladv newly married. Thcfe have confidcrably enhanced its value,
and he: doubts not, the ladies on this fide of the Atlantic will be as
generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their ad
vantage as-thofe in Engiand and Ireland have been.
