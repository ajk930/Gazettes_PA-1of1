PHILADELPHIA
ON Monday last week, the Chiefs and Warriors of the Five
Nations aflembled at the State-House, and were welcomed
to the city of Philadelphia, in an Address delivered by the Go
vernor. Three of the Chiefs made a general acknowledgment for
the cordial reception which they had experienced, but postponed
â¢heir formal answer until another opportunity. The room in
which they airemblcd, was mentioned as the ancient Council
Chamber, in which their Anceftcrs, and ours, often met to
brighten the Chain of Friendship ; and this circumstance, together
with the presence of a great part of the Beauty of the city, bad an
evident effect upon the feelings of the Indians, and seemed, paiti
cularly, to err.barrafs the elocution of the Farmer's Brother. â
The following is a copy of the
GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS
Chiefs and Warriors ojthe Five Nations !
Brothers !
I AM happy in receiving your vifu ; and, as Governor of the
State of Pennfyivania, 10 giving )ou a cordial welcome to this
city.
Brothers '
Nothing contributes more to flrengthen and preserve the frirnd
fh:p of nations, as well as of individuals, than a tree and constant
mtcrcourfe; rnd I hope that the good understanding which has
hitherto subsisted between your Nations and Pennsylvania, WÂ»Vi,
byYuch means, be rendered as beneficial, and as lasting, as the
Sun.
Brothers!
My pleasure in feeing you here is grest'y encreafed, by com
paring the confidence and attachment, which are shewn in your
visit, with the unhappy spirit of discord, by which some of the
Wcflern Indians are actuated.
Brothers !
In this very Hftufe your Fathers and the Governors of Pennsyl
vania have often aflembled, to express their regard for each other,
and to brighten the Chain of Frienafhip.
Brother s!
It mult be pleating to us to imitate so good an example : while,
as inhabitants of ihe fame country, it will always be our interest
to prefervc inviolate those bonds of faith and honor, by which our
anceftois were united,
Brothers!
You know thar the people of Pennsylvania consider war a* an
enerey io the happiness of t/he human race, and peace as a source
o. various hleftings. Yoa will therefore believe, that wefinoerely
deplore the calamities which are felt by both the parties engaged
in the prelent confl 6t; and are dcfirous to behold every cause of
â¢oiu.itjr and refenun'ent done away.
Brothers !
j ou are come to listen to the Councils of the great Father of
t. nion; lcr the truths which he will unfold make a deep im
pre uon on y*oi\r minds, and induce you to believe that the citi
zens of the Crjitfd States <ire rtrongly difpoied to promote the
their Indian brethren.
Brother s /
Once r^ orc I bid you wclcome : The President, whose pro
v 'iKe it i ;q nc g oc j a r c an j conclude ticaties, has directed his ofii
Wednesday, April 4, 1792.
cers to provide for your accommodation, comfort, and (upport,
while you remain among us; but I (hall, likcwife, be happy t<>
teffify my elteem for your Nations, by every mark of attention,
which it is in my power to bestow.
Brothers!
t know the kindnef? with which you treat the (Grangers that
visit your country ; and it is my sincere wilh, that, when you re
turn to your families, you may be ible to afluri- them, that th
virtues of friendfhip and hospitality are also pradifed by the citi
zens of Penrif^tvania.

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF FRANCE, Jan. iB.
M. Brifl'ot, in a long speech, endeavored to
prove the necessity for going to war. Herepre
fented most of the Princes of Europe, as " pro
(trated at the feet of the National Aflembly of
France the Emperor, however, appeared to
him, to have adopted an attitude lei's humble.
He therefore proposed that vigorous war (hould

L O N D ON, February 4
M. Bonille lias Dot luccecded in his
rions for 10,000 Hessians for the emigrant Princes,
but the Landgrave is (aid to have agreed to lec
them have all 1 lie malefactors at a Louis d'or a
head. This is certainly much more ceconomical
than Mr. Pitt's plan of ti anfportation to Botany
Bay.
Major Houghton, when he wrote to the com
mittee 01 the African Aflociation, informed them
that he had penetrated iooo miles up the river
Senegambia. He has traiifmitted an accurate
diary of dittances and latitudes.
Rulfia hawing now no competitor forthe throne
in Prince Poteii'kin, the Great Duke will certain
ly rightfully and peaceably (ucceed to the crown
of that mighty empire. His own good qualities
merit, and his talents for making thole happy
over whom he may rule, render him a woahv
fucceflor to the immortal Catharine. There is
no one who knows the magnanimity and muni
ficence of the la(l mentioned Pi iucefs, that would
willi her d >ys ro be shortened one moment. But:
come the time when it may, it will not be the
worle tor Old England. I"he Great Duke bears
the British much good will ; and his miniiters
will not be wanting to uphold him in it.
We are well informed that the spirit of his
Majesty's speech will soon take effect, as we un
deritand that the minister hasfignified to the ad
miralty his Majesty's intention ; the fame to the
Secretary at war. The guard-ihips, we hear,
will be reduced to sevenâthree at Portsmouth,
three at Plymouth, and one at Chatham.
The regiments are to be reduced to their ef
tablifliment, the fame as before the armament of
1787, in favor of the Stadtholder, which will be
equal to the reduction of fix or seven regiments.
Wherever the French emigrants have afleni
bled in any number, the people have been very
naturally led to inquire into the cause of leaving
their own country, and from inquiry to forming
a judgment of their motives and principles. This
judgment has been so generally against them,
that the people of Srafburgh, affirm, they havt
executed orders for more than twenty chotifand
national cockades, forthe inhabitants of the ad
jacent German States.
These circnmftances, perhaps, as much as the
finances of France, have made the Princes who
at si.-st received them, glad of a pretext to get
rid of such dangerous guests. What rendered
the conduct of the Princes the more obnoxious,
was their folly and extravagance, which raised
the price of provisions wherever tliey refilled.
The state of the emigrants forces, lime com
pelled to quit the dominions of the ElecTtor of
Treves, is become still moredefperate :h 111 ever ;
they are now greatly dispersed, and have ftif
tained a considerable diminution of numbers ;
and thus, probably, ends the enterprize of a
counter revolution, which has for two jears em
ployed so many various reports.
EDINBURGH, January 30.
We have frequently taken notice of the perni
cious effects of i'pirits on the lower ranks of the
people. When gin was fold in England at the
fame rate whiiky now is in Scotland, the manu
faifluvers were ruined ; the poor-houses were so
crowded with emaciated and useless objects, and
the poor rates were so much increased, that thÂ£
landed gentlemen, and overseers of the poor,
petitioned the Legiftature for heavy duties on
fpirliuouS liquors, which were imposed accord
ingly, and happily since that period the people
have drank wholcfoine malt liquors. We have
seen that the American Congress have introduced
an Excise Law, to put a flop to so deftrutftive an
evil; we have also seen that the Legislature of
Ireland has taken the most vigorous plans for the
lime pnrpofe ; and it is with the greatest plea
sure we now fee the Courts of Law in Scotland
adopting similar measures. It appears from se
veral late trials that many of thecrimes that have
been la ely committed, have taken their origin
from this deftrutftive vice,and Sir John Sinclair's
Statistical Account of Scotland, too evidently
shows that it is the cause of the ruin of the mo
rals, and the increase of the poor raies, in the
parishes in Scotland. It would certainly be of
great utility to get a higher duty intpofed on dis
tilled spirituous liquors in Scotland, and to give
more encouragement to the brewers of malt li
quors, as is now the cafe in Ireland.CONGRESS.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY, February 21, 1792
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOII.
On the Militia Bill.
[concluded]
A MOTION by Mr. Fitzfimons, to exempt per
sons who are not able to arm and equip
themselves, from any penalty on that account,
while that disability continues, occalioned loine
debate.
Mr. Sumpter entered into a general considera
tion of the fubjeiSâHe denied thatCongrefs had
any right to interfere vviih tlie regulations of
the several dates in respect to the militiaâtheir
â whole power refpecfts only the calling the mili
tia into adhial service, in cases of invalion, infur
redlion or rebellionâand when thus called into
service, they may provide for the organizing and
arranging them in companies, corps and battali
onsâand it is the duty of the general govern
ment then to provide them with the means of
defenceâbut they have no right to fay that the
militia previous to beingthus called out, (hall be
at the expence of arming themselves. He hoped
the bill would take a different direction,-and that
Congress would not so far interfere in this bufi.
ne(s as to defignat-e the persons who (hall bear
arms, and tt> fay how they lhall be armed.âlt
seems to be the opinion of foine gentlemen, ac
cording to the observations which have fallen
from them, that the militia service (hall be im
posed on" a comparatively fin all part of the citi
zens ; and this inequality is to be encreafed by
obliging those persons to be at the expence of
arming themselves.âHe hoped that such injus
tice would not take place.
Mr. Niles adverting to the constitution, ob
served that it appeared to him, that a provision
for arming the militia was reserved to the ltates,
io far as it refperfis the common defenceâHe
considered the requisition in the bill as operating
like a capitation tax ; and this species of tax he
observed, was to be afleiled only in a certain way,
agreeable to a particular clause in the -constitu
tion He concluded by moving that the clause
in the bill which contained this provilion for
arming, should be struck our.
This motion was negatived
Mr. Fitzfimons withdrew his motion, which
provided for a certificate from two jultices of the
peaceâto admit a fubltitute, which provides that
they shall be excused if in the judgment of the
comminioned officers to whose company they be
long, theyare not able to furnHli thenifclves.
This substitute was adopted.
Mr. Kitchell moved that the clause should be
struck out, which provides that the calibers of
the guns should be of one bore. He observed
that this provifioii was unneceilary, and in faifl
impossible to be complied with.
Mr. Sumpter alked what was to be done with
the arms which the militia now have in their
Jiands, are they to be thrown away râ-Befides,
he thought the provision inconsistent with the
actual state of the military force of the country,
the laws for the regulation of which, contem
plates the enrolment of rifle-men among the re
gular forces of the country âAdverting to the
expence which would attend this provision, he
observed it was almott totally impracticable to
.carry it into execution.âHe hoped it would not
be agreed to, as it would involve an enormous
and unnecefl'ary expense.
Mr. Murray offered Come similar remarksâhe
did not conceive that the excellency of the mi
litia of the United States confuted in their being
armed all with mulkets of the fame bore. He did
not consider the bill in the light that some gen
tlemen appeared toâit was in his opinion meer
ly a provision to keep alive a military germ, that
stall when occasion calls spring up and difFufe
its influence among the people in such manner as
to furnifhthe nioft competent means of defence.
Mr. Wadfworth objected to the motionâhe
said this was one of the very few good refula
tions left in the bill, and to strike oiu this w7>uld
render the militia a fallacious reiource of defence
and effectually destroy every idea of uniformity!
Mr. Kitchell's motion was negatived.
The motion to expunge the exemptions was
seconded by Mr. Dayton.
Mr. Boudinot opposed itâhe urged in brief
the several reasons which were offered on a for
mer occasion in support of the exemptions.
Mr. Dayton said it appeared to him unreason
able to exempt persons from militia duty, and
from paying an equivalent too who from their
ilation in life are belt qualified to pay tliofe equi
valents ; it appeared to him to be unjust and im
politic.
Mr. J. Smith opposed the motionâhe observed
that the experience of the eastern States where
the militia is on at leaf* as resectable a footing
a<s in nny part of the union, was againlt the fpi
nt of the motionâthere various exemptions aie
madeâand the prejudices of the pepple were in
favor of the pra<ftice--many exemptions are neeef
fary and many characters in society cannot and
ought not to be compelled to bear
ters of the gospel, &c. To combat thele preju
dices, he said, would belittle better than attack
ing a windmill.
.several other gentlemen-spoke on the fiibjecft,
The motion was finally negatived.
The third fedlion being read,
Mr. J. Smith moved that'thefe words, after the
word " companiesâln fitch manner as the Prep
dent of the United Slates Jha// fee proper to direct,"
(hould be (truck out. He observed, that as the
President of the United States has (by the Con
rtitution) no command over the militia till they
are called into adtual service, he cannot with any
propriety be inverted with this powerâit lays
with the legislatures of thefevera! states, said he,
to make the provision requisite in this cafeâThe
executives of the several (lares mud be more
competent to determine the number of regiments,
&c. into which-their refpedtive militia's should
be divided.
Mr. Lawrance said the conrtitution, by invert
ing Congress with the power of organizing the
militia, appears neceflarily to have included the
power in question.
Mr. Livermore said he was in favor of linking
out the words, on iwo accountsâHe did not
know how the power could b& exercisedâand
he was opposed to retaining phrases which, how
ever founding and pompous they may be, con
tained no meaningâthis he conceived to be the
cafe in refpecfi 10 the words in questionâFor they
propose to invest a powei in the President, which,
said he, I do not fee how he can exercise ; or if
he can, certainly not with so much propriety as
the legislatures of the several states.
Mr. Hillhoufe was opposed to striking oat the
wordsâHe said he could conceive of no disad
vantage which would result from giving the Pre
sident the power of making a uniform arrange
ment of the militiaâlt appeared to be neceflary,
in order to his being able to determine how to
call them into service, Ihould public exigencies
require it, in such proportions and draughts as
{hall be most equal to the people, and molt con
ducive to the public service.
Mr. Page observed, that it appeared neceflary
to retain the clause, in order to effecting the ob
jetsfc of uniformityâfor if the power is inverted
in fifteen different bodies, or individuals, it can
not be expeifted that they will ever agree in one
uniform plan.âNor did he conceive that this re
"illation would in the least interfere with the es
sential powers of the several statesâHe was as
much averse as any man from abridging any of
the powers of the several states, but this regula
tion would not interfere with those powers, in
any manner whatever.
Mr. Seney was in favor of striking out He
thought it was a fufficient reason to rejedl the
clause, that the President could not be supposed
so competent to the business, as the authority of
the federal llates. 1
Mr. Snmpter was in favor of striking outâThe
scope of his observations was, that the United
States have power only to fay how the iniliiia
shall be organized, but it must be left to the se
veral states to carry the plan into execution.
Mr. Lawrance stated the difficulties which
would result from want of uniformity, in cafe
of the militia's being called into actual fei vice.
Mr. Niles, observed that the relative bounda
ries of towns, Hates and districts, rendered the
uniformity contended for, impracticable ; and
therefore the clavife is nugatoryâa great varie
ty as to numbers, in the companies and regimen:s
of the continental army, atftialTy exiftedduring
the late war, and yet no difficulty occis>rÂ«d from
that circnmftance.
The motion for striking out was carried.
It was then moved to insert in (uch manner
as the legislatures of the refpe&ive states fliall
direct"âthis was agreed to.
Mr. Gilman moved, that the clause in the 4th
fe<9ion, which provides that the Aids Ihall be tak
en from the line, and the words " with the rank,
of major," should be struck out He observed,
that in the regular service, on the principles of
economy this arrangement takes place but he
conceived this would be unneceflary in the mili
tia, if not injurious to the service. "
This amendment was agreed to.
The 6th fedion, which fpecifies the times of
muttering and training the mi'itia, fovs that the
artillery, light infantry, troops of horse, See.
(hall rendezvous four times a year, and the reft
of the militia twice a year.
Mr. J. Smith rose to enquire the reason of the
diftintftion between the coriDanies.
Mr. Barnwell moved to add a proviso, author
izing the (tates to pass laws enjoining musters as
oiten as they may fee proper.
Mr. Boudinot answered Mr. [.Smith's enquiry
âHe (aid the obje<ft was to form a nursery of
oincers for the militia, whenever detachments
(nail be suddenly called into atftual service.
390
Mr. J. Smith objected to Mr. BarnWil's p.
soâHe conceived that the dates already j
poflsffed this poÂ»er.
. The proviso, after farther debate, was nerj.
tived.

ExtraQ of a letter from Aux-Cayts, dated Feb. 14,
" Since my last there has been several planta
tion!) wholly burned, and a number that have
had part of their buildings and part of their
canes destroyed ; we are not able to fay the ex
adi number, as the Mulattoes have the entire
possession of the plain, except the white encamp
ment which is about two miles out of town. Sa
turday last arri-ved from France, via the Cape, a
transport (hip and schooner' with three hundred
â¢ infantry and about thirty artillery men ; who
â with about three hundred militia of this place,
we expedl will march to-morrow or next day to
the plains, in order to attack the Mulartoes.
There was an attack on Tiberoon the 24th of
'lift nioiy h, wherein the Mulattoes were defeated
-âthey c;ime on very determined, in two divifi
. ons, till they were within pistol (hot, when the
â firft volley offmall arms was fired from the Fort,
â¢ which threw them into d'iforder, and they re
treated with gre3t precipitation, leaving 25dead
near the Fort. This is the only place on this

HIGH pay âlong speechesâand long feflions,
Provoke complaints, with harsh expreflions !
Should Congress serve for smaller pay,
Who would compose that body, ptay ?
Would the y be men of real merit,
Of talents prov'riâof manly spirit ?
Or poor and cringing tools for Kings ?
Or rich, and lord-like strutting things ?
Could men, whose talents at the bar
Exceed the pay of Congress, far;
Do&ors and merchants leave their
As delegates to make parack: ?
Can honor keep a man from starving ?
Must he not now and then be carving ?
Will he so honest be, and nice,
As not to cut a single slice ?
From Government not take a fop ?
When thirsting, not receive a drop ?
Britain pays not a firtgle (Killingâ
Her menders are forever swilling.
Royal fops her boroughs swallow,
And minifteria) taxes follow !
The labourer is worth his hire,
To due rewaids let each aspire !
And let freemen pay their friends
As well as Kingsâon this depends
Whether the freedom they have got,
Shall last to endless time, or not :
Or starved, look out for royal bounty,
And be forgotten in each county !
Long speeches may long feflions yield ;
But 'gainst great errors they may shield.
Long feflions may much money coilâ
In short on s, freedom may be loft!
Whoever values free debate,
'Gainst long speeches fbould not prate :
Whoever views with real glee,
Cash coming from the treasury,
Which, circulating round the land,
Returns into that very hand
Which paid it there, for the excise,
Or impost duty, is not wife;
If with great pleasure he don't view
The (urns which thence the Congress drewâ
But why should he (hew discontent,
Who never paid one (ingle cent ;
Yet oft, for any trifling trafli,
Receiv'd a (hare of this fame cash ?
Cease to complain without a reason,
I'll tell you when to cry out-4-Trcafon! ! !

equal in quantity; the eaftwardly pa-t being arable lanfl' uJaid
off in convenient si: Ids, and in good farming oidcr. The other
part, bounded by the said street on the east, and by the river . a
the weft, forms afquare; which, from the combined effect of li g
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the molt
beautiful and desirable teals in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-finifhed brick building 5 o by 40, containing J-> ur
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a twoftory brick
kuchen ; and commanding a very extcnfive and pleasing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-bmldings are a new stone
ccach-houfe and stables, futftcient to contain fix carriages and ten

veral years part, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, brfides
supporting through the fummcr fealon twenty to thirty homed
cattle, and eight or ten horfep. It contains also two beating or.
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper fedfans,
with great pl< nty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frefh water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both of which
may afford a pleasing amusement to the fponfman, as wejl as a
