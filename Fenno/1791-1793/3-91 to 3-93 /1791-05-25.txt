TRANSLATED
For the GAZETTE oj the UNITED STATES,
A DISCOURSE OF STEPHEN BOETIUS,
Concerning voluntary Servitude : Or the Anti-One.
(Continued from A : o. 6of this Gazette.)
BUT ill truth, it is idle to debate, whether li
berty is natural since we cannot hold any
one in Servitude, without doing him wrong : and
there is nothing in the world so contrary to na
ture, which is all reasonable, as injustice. It re
mains then to fay that liberty is natural, and for
the fame reason in my opinion, that we are not
only born in the poffeflion of our freedom, but
also with affecftion to defend it. But if you are
in doubt of this and are so far bastardized, that
you cannot recognize your property, nor indeed
your natural affei'lions, I must do you the honor
which belongs to you, and raise up the brute
beasts into the pulpit, to preach to you, your
own nature and condition. The brutes (God
bless me) if men are not deaf, cry out to them,
' Liberty forever !' Several among them die as
soon as they are taken ; as the fillies which lose
their lives as soon as their water, quit the light
and will nocfurvive their natural liberty m If the
animals had among them their ranks and pre
eminences, they would make their nobiliiy, in my
opinion, consist in freedom. The others from the
gieatell to the least, when we take them, make
lb great a reliftance witli their nails, their horns,
their hoofs and their bills, that they declare,
loudly enough, how dearly they hold that-which
they lose. Being taken, they give us so many
apparent signs of the knowledge tliey have of
their misfortune, that it is beautiful to fee that
from that time, it is rather languifbing than liv
ing ; and that their lives are continued more to
bfcinoan their loft liberty, than to take pleasure
in servitude. What less than this is the language
of the elephant, who, having defended liiuifelf,
as long as he could, feeing no longer any remedy,
and being on the point of being taken, he seizes
a tree with his jaws, and breaks out his teem :
Kis great desire to remain 'free, as he was born,
gives him wit and invention, and instigates him
to bargain with the hunters, to be quitted for
his teeih, and to pay with his ivory tlie ransom
of his liberty. We pamper the liorfe as loon as
he is born, in order to tame him to the service :
and although we know the art of flattering him,
and succeed in taming him, yet he champs at the
bit, and he flings at the spur, as if to ihevv his
nature, and teftify at least by this impatience,
that although he serves, it is not with his con
feut but by our constraint. What shall we fay
then ? Even the oxen groan in the yoke and the
birds complain in the cage, as I have laid here
tofore elsewhere in some of my amusements in
French rhymes, for I am not afraid, in writing
to you (O'Longa) to intermix my own verses,
which however I never read but when you make
me vain by pretending to be pleased with them.
Since therefore all things which have fentiuient,
or sensibility, feel the evil of fubjetftion and pant
after liberty : Since the beasts, which are made
for the service of man, cannot accustom 'theni
felves to service, without frequent protestations
of a contrary desire : What marvellous abfuidity,
is that which has been able so to unnaturalize
man, who in truth was alone born to live in free
dom, as to make him lose the memory of his
primitive condition, and the desire of regaining
it ?
There are three forts of tyrants. I speak of
wicked Princes. Some have their Kingdoms by
the election of the peopleâothers by force of
arms, and others by succession of consanguinity.
Thole who have acquired it, by the right of war,
we know very well how they behave in it. They
are, as we fay, in the land of conquest. Thole
who are born Kings, aie not commonly much
better : being bom and nouri(hed in the blood
of the tyranny, they draw in with their milk
the nature of the tyrant, and make a property,
an estate of the people who are under them, as
of their hereditary villaines : and according to
their complexions, by which they are more in
clined to be avaricious or prodigal, they behave
in their kingdoms as in their inheritances. He
to whom the people have given the State, ought
to be, I should think more supportable : and
would be lb, as 1 believe, were it not that, as
soon as they fee themselves elevated above others,
flattered by something, 1 know not what which
is called grandeur, he deliberates on the me,ins of
holding his preeminence. Commonly fucta an
â¢Wednesday, May 25, 1 79 1.
one makes &n estate of the power which tiie
people have depolited inhini totranfmit it to his
children. But, from the time that these have
taken such ail opinion, it is a Itrarfge thing, how
much they surpass in all forts of vices, and even
in cruelly, the other tyrants. They fee no other
means, of afluring the new tyranny, than by ex
tending far and wide, thefervitude, and estrange
their fubjefts so far from lib vty, even while the
memory of it, is still freft. â  as to make them
wholly lose it. Thus to i-jf the truth, 1 fee
very well that there is some difference between
thein ; but 1 fee no choiceâand although the
means of arriving at kingdoms are different,
still the manner of reigning, is very much alike.
The eletfted as if they had taken bulls to tame,
treat them accordingly. The conqnerors think
they have a right, as to their prey : The fuc
ceflors, think they have a right, as to their natu
ral llaves.

ODE
TO HENRY.
WITH what an anxious, trembling, joy
Doth Modesty his powers employ !
While earnest pantings fill his breast,
He shrinks with (hadowy fears diftreft.
Warm'd with Fancy's glowing fire,
Henry can thy foul desire
Far from Virtue's aid to fly ?
Virtue daughter of the Iky.
C I had hoped, with fond delight,
With thee, ambitious, to unite ;
With thee to wake the answering lyre ;
With thee the strength of truth infpirc.
Now thou fli'ft the doubtful field ;
Yet untried, I fee theo yield ; {
Shun the stormy face of day,
Which to glory points the way.
We might have join'd, with studious care,
To chafe from earth tire fiend Despair.
To wake new tenderness and truth,
New virtue, in the foul of Youth.
Mi.ejht f- ; -ndfllio rijP**
Love regardless of disguise ;
Merit garb anew the mind ;
Worth the glory of mankind.
To us the Muse have oped her store
With luxury unknown before ;
Our fainting fouls with strength have fired ;
Our fotig with energy inspired.
Now a tear her cheek bedewsâ
" Henry hath forgot the Muse.
" Slights the power whose constant care
" Makes him lovely to his fair.
" Tell him, altho the fires of ever.,
" Before the Sun, are loft in heav;n ;
" Like, are the Muse's splendid iays,
" Th c gloiy oj the latter days.
" Radiance gilds the Poet's sky ;

Si R,
WE, the inhabitants of Georgetown, and of its vicinity, beg
leave to congratulate you upon your fafe arrival in South-
Carolina, and to assure you, that having ever entertained a high
sense of the obligations which you have conferred upon your fel
low-citizcns in general, we are happy to embrace this opportuni

of affe&ion : We are no less happy, Sir, at being called upon by
the laws to obey, and to refpeft as firft Magiftraie of the federal
Republic, that person, whom of all men we were most disposed
to revere as our benefa&or, and to love as the father ol his country.
Having ftiared in the diftrelfcs of the war, and been exposed to
those calamities, and to that lofsof property, which were the con
fluences of it, we have been taughl to set a proper value upon
the exertions which were made in our behalf, we have experien
ced the happy influence of your councils, Sir, and have distinguish
ed you as the guardian of our laws, and of our liberties, as an m
ftrument in the hands of providence to protect our dearest rights,
and to save us from oppreflion. The breath of popular applause
is fleeting, but the merit of such illustrious actions can never be
effaced ; they czjry along with them their best reward, and we
trust, Sir, that in pursuing your progress through this state, you
will have the fatisfaÂ£tion to perceive a spirit of freedom, which
your services during the war enabled us to maintain ; a degree of
order and tranquility, which your administration has diffufed,
and a growing profperny, than which no better proof could exist,
of the goodness and efficacy of that government, over which you
preside.
Such, fir, are the feniiments with which we approach you upon
this occasion, and fucii the feniiments which wc shall in honor,
and in gratitude transmit to our latest posterity.

To the BRETHREN of PRINCE-GEORGE's LODGE No. 16,
Gentlemen,
THE cordial welcome which you gave me to Georgetown, and
the congratulations you are pleased to offer on my ele&ion to the
Chief Magistracy of the United States receive my grateful thanks.
I am much obliged by your good wifhcs and reciprocate them
with sincerityâalluring the society of my esteem, I request them
to believe that I (hall always be ambitious of being considered a
deserving biother. GFORGE WASHINGTON,
Charleston, May 5, 1791.
To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
Sir,
THE intendant and wardens, repfefentatives of the citizens of
Charleston, find themselves particularly gratified by your arrival
in the metropolis of this State.
It is an event, the expe&ation of which they have, for some
time, with great plcafure indulged.
When in the person ol the supreme magistrate of the tJnited
States, they recognize the father of the people, and the defender
of the liberties ot America, they feel a peculiar fatisfaftion in de
claring their fiim persuasion, that they speak the language of their
conftituenti, in asserting that no body of men throughout this ex
tensive continent can exceed them in attachment to his public cha
racter, or in revering his private virtues : and they do not hesitate
in anticipating those bleflings which must ultimately be diffufed
among the inhabitants of these States, from his exertions tor their
general welfare, aided by those in whom they have also rested a
(hare of their confidence.
Go on, fir, as you have done.âContinue to pofTefs as well as
to deserve the love and esteem of all your fellow-citizens ! while
millions in other parts of the globe, though strangers to your per
son, (ball venerate your name.
May you long be spared to receive those marks of refpefl,
which you so entirely merit from a grateful people, aud may all
who live under your auspiceÂ«, continue to experience that free
dom and happiness which is so universally acknowledged to have
proceeded from your wife, judicious and prudent administration.
At nold Vanderhorst, Intendant.
THE ANSWER.
To the INTENDANT and WARDENS, Representatives of the
citizcos of Charleflon.
Gentlemen,
THE gratification you are pleased to express at my arrival in
your metropolis, is replied to with fincenty, in a grateful ac
knowledgement of the pleating feufations which your affc&iouatc
urbanity has excited.
Highly sensible of your attachment and favorable opinions, I
intrcat you to be persuaded of the lading gratitude which they
impress, and of the cordial regard with which they are returned.
It is the peculiar boast of our country that her happiness is
alone dependant on the ooHe&ive wisdom and virtue of her citi
zens, and rests not on the exertions of any individual. While a
just sense is entertained of our natural and political advantages,
we cannot fail to improve them ; and, with the progress of our
national importance, to combine the freedom and felicity of in
dividuals.
I (hall be particularly gratified in observing the happy influence
of public measures on the prosperity of your city, which is so en
titled to tbe regard and esteem of the American Uniou.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
GEO&CE WASHINGTON.FOR THE GAZETTE OF TliL UNITED STATES.
SONNET TO Jt E FLECTION.
THE Lord of light has journey'd down the fly,
And b;i:h'd his courfeis in the foaming wave ;
The twinkling flar of hv'en too, hastes to lave,
Her (liver form, and vanish from my eye.
Now dusky twilight (lings her sombre shade,
O'er the bright beauties of the silent vale,
The afpin trembles not, the verdant blade,
No longer nodding answers to the gale.
Come fwect Refleflion ! hither pcnfive Maid !
Direst thy wandering steps, and on this iVjne,
Worn by no travellers feet, with inofs o'ergrown,
R pose with me in solitude's deep (hade.
Then (hall I know the height of human bliss,
And tafle the joy of other worlds in this.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Jsrr. u.
THE maflacre of the brave garri&n of Ifmael
by the Ruliians has so enraged rhe grand
Seignior tliat he has (worn to pursue the war against
the Ruffians to the utmost extremity, and never
to pardon the useless cruelty exercised by that
nation, even in the midst of its victories, and af
ter so many conquests. Wethei eforedo not think
that the Sultana mother will be able to persuade
her son to participate in the universal dread and
consternation that reigns in the capital.
The Sultan, who feeins alfured of apeace with
the House of Aultria, is preparing to direcft all
his forcesagainft Ruifia.
frl the mandates which he has sent to all the
Governors, Pachas, and Cadies, throughout his
estates, he breathes nothing but vengeance, or
dering them to enrol all his fubje<fts, who are
able to bear arms, from fifteen to sixty years of
age ; but the general consternation ieeuis contra
ry to rhefe ineafures : Peace or war can no longer
depend either on the forces or the decrees of the
Divan. The destiny of the Turkifli empire de
pends entirely on the mediating powers, by their
putting a flop to or prolonging hostilities, or by
their giving or refufing peace. There is, however,
some likelihood, that the Porte, upon reflection,
will, after having made peace with the houle of
Austria, conclude one with the EmprefsofÃuflia.
VIENNA, Feb. 23.
We are allured, that England has demanded a
categorical answer from our Court as to what his
Imperial Majesty will do if the Empress will not
conclude a peace, and the allied Courts fliould
find it neceilary to oblige her to it.
LEYD EN, March 3.
In these times of trouble and agitation the con
tagion had reached Switzerland, but the prudent
firmnefs of its government, particularly that of
the Canton oi Berne, flopped the fermentation
in its beginning, but it exists strongly on the fron
tiers, particularly in the Biftioprick of Bade, and
at Geneva, which latter place fuffered a kind of
assault on the part of the peasantry, who pretend
ed they ought to be admitted to the privileges of
citizens gratuitoully ; and who, in that enterprise
were seconded by the French of the county of
Gex, whilst the populace favored them within
the city.
The true purport of all this seems to be to make
Geneva a French municipality.
PARIS, March 10,
No sooner is the spirit of infurreftion quelled
in one province, than it appears in another with
redoubled mifchief. Blois and the circumjacent
towns are a prey to all the horrors attendant on
fanaticiftn. The ex-prelate will, in despite of
the law, continue in the fee ; the prieftsand de
votees of both sexes identify themselves by the
crofter-and mitre ; they inflame the minds of the
more ignorant, and are ingenious in fomenting
difcoril, and breathing execration against the
proceedings of the Aflembly. Compte De La
Tour, known by his unmilitary exploits at Bifort
in Alsace, which place he was obliged to quit,
is now at Metz; he was the person coinnm'iioned
by the Prince of Conde, to alt the elector for
the use of his palace at Wormsâit is very gene
rally imagined that M. Artois, M. de Calonne,
and rhe chief of the French fugitives will foun
meet there.
The King is now considered to bethe molt de
cidedly for the New Constitutionâevery a<ft of
Ins goes to prove it; and so convinced are the
National Reprelentatives of what we advance,
that yesterday, when it was in agitation to know
â¢whether or not the adminifhator of the public
treasure should be named by the King, it was
decreed in the affirmative.
It is fomewbathngular that Britons, who come
to France to view the Aurora of liberty, soon
become wedded to the aristocratic principles
we know many who, at home, are columns of
the opposition, but are here friendly to the un
popular cause.
The King lies dangerously ill. The late trou
bles have altered the ltate of his health: He
J'pits blood and lias a most violent cough. He is
confined to his bed.
A letter from Lyons informs us, that the Mef
dames palled through that city without any op
position. They mult consequently be now out
of the power of the National Afleuibly and of
the Kilh-woinen ofParis.
Comptede Mirabeau was the highell bidder
for the Abbey of Argeiueuil, so celebrated for
the tears of the too tender Eloifa when lhe re
ceived the veil from the hands of her unfortu
nate husband. The Comte is fending thither the
elegant library of the late Mr. BufFon, which he
has also bought.
The Duke de Richelieu died the 12th of this
month after along illness; he leaves one son,
who is at present in the Rufiian service, and
who diltinguifherl kimfelf at the taking of Ifniael.
The ladies of Thouloufe allembling in great
bodies ta hinder the Clergy from taking the ci
vic oath, the municipality ordered the pumps to
be worked, and actually walhed away all their
opposition.
B I R T H A.
Major-General Popow, is arrived here with
dispatches from Prince Potemkin. He has deli
vered up to the Eniprefsthe keys of Ifmael, toge
ther with th* particulars of the liege which have
been publilhed by order of the court. The whole
narrative takes up three sheets of paper. There
were in the fortrefs 42,000 regular troops, be
sides the inhabitants; 30,8r6 men were killed;
14,000 were taken prisonersâ 2,000 Turkifti sol
diers died the next day of the wounds they had
received, and 1000 more were diftributecl among
the conquerors, to be supported by them.
The Empress intends to make Prince Potem
kin a prelent, as soon as he arrives, of a mag
nificent and superb suit of clothes, adorned with
diamond buttons, epaulets, and loops, worth be
tween two and three hundred thousand roubles.
Her Majesty has also purchased for him the Pa
lace of StockbofF for 400,000 roubles, which is
to be fitted up and furniflied in the molt superb
stile.
All the frontiers are lined with troops, artille
ry and ammunition, just as if an invasion was
threatened.
An attempt had been made through the ladies
of the Seraglio, with the Empress Mother at their
head, to induce the Sultan, on account of the
late very ill success of his troops, to come into
a peace on any terms. These were seconded, or
more properly set on by fix thousand Grandees
of the empire, who had all put their hands to a
petition for that purpose. But the Sultan, 011
receiving advice of the capture of Ifmael, and
the cruelties pra<3ifed there by the Ruffians,
most gallantly fvore, that he would sooner be
buried under the ruins of Constantinople, than
make peace with so brutal an enemy.
Everfince that period it has been publicly pro
claimed at Constantinople, that it (hall be death
for any one to talk of peace ; and the ladies of
the Seraglio have been enjoined under threats
of the fame puniftiment, not to intermeddle again
in any thing of the like tendency. The Empe
ror, no doubt, finds himfelf strengthened by the
exhortations of the Britifli and Prussian ambafla
dors, who have certainly promised him assistance
from their mailers, should their offers of medi
ating a peace l>e rejected. The Emperor of Ger
many, too, it is not doubted, will give assistance
to the mediation, the moment bis own peace with
the Turks is concluded, which is allowed to be
in the most favorable train.
In the mean time Catharine still remains llub
born. Prond and imperious, and unaccustomed
to controul, she will not allow of any mediation,
nor admit of peace at all, unless dictated by her ;
or rather means perhaps entirely to defer it, till
her favorite General shall have planted her en
ligns on the walls of Conftantinoplt.
To oppose any attempt which the Pruflians may
intend to make in favor of the Turks, her ar
mies in Livonia are perpetually increaling. To
oppose the Englifti, should they offer to enter
the Baltick, orders are given to fit and imme
diately draw out her whole fleet, confiding of
thirty-fix ships of the line, and several frigates,
the command of which is entrusted to Prince
Alexis Orlow, who/performed so many gallant
things in the course of thelaft war, on the coasts
of Egypt, and several parts of the Levant and
Greece and was afterwards some time resident
here in England.
The American Payne over-flrepped the bounds
of prudence, and his publisher ihru nk from the
danger ; but another has been found more hardy.
That publisher has escaped for the ' Leflons to a
Prince the principles of which work, refpe<fl
:ng our having ' 110 political constitution,' no re
presentation, &c. are literally adopted and co
pied by Payne.

From the CONNECTICUT COVRANT.
THE PATRIOT.
THE constant cry of the British merchants to
the Americans is, you are by nature design
ed for an agricultural society : You have an a
bundance of land ; an extenlive country adapted
to the culture of almost every kind of valuable
productions : To the multiplying these produc
tions you should bend your whole united efforts,
and leave to Europeans the trouble of transport
ing these produces to foreign marketsâworking
up into the various manufactures that part whicli
are designed for such improvements, and return
ing you such of them as are suited to your mar
kets. But why, 1 ask, do they constantly ring
this peal in our ears ? 13 it because that manual
labor, applied to the production of raw mater
ials, will procure the person who performs it
more of the con veniencies of life than the fame
quantity of labor employed in manufactures ?â
Certainly not ; otherways common laborers in
the field would get better monthly wages than
Jradefmen, which every one knows is not the
cafe.âWould it not therefore be quite as wife
and economical for the Americans to fend their
wheat to London to be made into flour, and re
turned for their consumption, as to fell the 811-
tilh merchant their tobacco, and import from
Great-Britain their ftinfF-âand so 011 their iron,
&c. These foreign counsellors, aided by ill in
formed and interested Americans, urge us to la
bor in the field altogether, and leave it to the
Britons, the Persians, and the Chinese, to cloath
us for feeding them. Let us examine this mat
ter, and fee if this advice be the result ofiriend
fhip for us, or from an insidious plan, long fine 6
laid, of keeping us always dependant on them,
and subjected to their domination.
It is true we have, at much expence and haz
ard, set ourselves free from the dominion of then
government âwe have set their armies at defiance
âbut not their artifrins. We are not in reab.;i
ndependent whilll we arc obliged to look to
hem for our lieceflary cloathing, or even liiper
iuous ornaments.
Suppose the whole population of this country,
which is lo rapidly increasing, were devoted to
hulbandryâwhat depreciations would be made
in our forefts*! How loon would our fields be
cloatlied with every kind of grainâapd our pas
tures filled with cattle, feeding oil a thousand
hills ! This would be charmingâno fear of a fa
mineâevery one would have food for allcing fol
icâbut what price would our provisions bring,
and what is to be done with thefurplus of them ?
Why fay thel'e wife men from the East, (and their
humble retainers of this country) let the Euro
peans come and fetch them away, or starve.â
This is very goodâand pray what are we to do
if their crops lhould not happen to fail themâ
or when their kings should be tired of war, and
consent that their iubjeCts be permitted to culti
vate their own fields in fafety ; will these fo
reigners, out of mere charity, come and take your
i'uperiiuous crops off your hands ? Will they give
you a generous price for your wheat, &c. ? I
presume not. Pray let me alk these politicians,
these friends from the other fide the water, who
are so alarmed left we injure ourselves, by en
gaging improvidently in manufactures, why
grain is dearer in England than iii America
Our lands do not produce so many bushels on the
acre as theirsâwe give higher for labor, and yet
we undersell them lb much in market, thattheir
farmers would be ruiaed if a free importation
from this country was admitted. I (hall proba
bly be told that rents in thac country are higher,
and that causes the difference; but I demand,
why are rents higher there than here ? Why be
raufe the products of land will fell so mueh high
er there than here. And why do they fell so
much higher there than here ? Is it for exporta
tion ? No such thingâlt is because of the "inalti
tude of their mechanics and artizans, who create
a conltanc demand for home consumption.
A home market is always the belt, abating ex
traordinary demands that may arise from the ac
cidental failure of crops in a foreign country ;
or the ruinous depredations of enemy. The
average price of wheat in England, 1 suppose may
be stated at 6s. to 6s. 6d. lterling the bufiiel.
"When it arileth to 7s. the bufliel, their ports are
opened for importation, lealt the dearnefs of
bread (hould injure their man utadlures; but when
it falls to the uftial standard, their importations
are prohibited, left the farming interell (houkl
l'uffer.
The average price of wheat in America, taken
at the farmers' lioufes, inay be rated at j to j-6
of a dollar ; tho at the ports of. exportation it may
average one dollar. But if our country was as
full of manufacturers as Great-Britain, our grain
would be principally wanted for home consump
tion, and the price would be raised to js. 3d. or
even 6s. sterling the bufliel. The farmer would
then save not only the transportation to the sea
port towns ; but the subsequent storage, shipping
coastwise, freight, insurance, &c. to Europe; and
the price and rent of lands would rife in propor
tion. But this is not the whole advantageâ.if
we can make our own cloarhing, it will soon re
duce the price materially, and enable them to
make a saving in their purchases as vvell as on
the sales of their crops, so that the farming in
terest is most intimately concerned in tlie fuc
refs of our manufactures. Whenever wool be
comes as plenty in this country as it is in Eng
land, the price of woolen goods made here will
be as low as those of the fame quality are in that
country ; and the expence of purchasing, pack
age, storage, shipping charges, freight and in
stance will be a clear saving to this country.
J his cannot be rated at less than 20 per cent, on
all our importations Think of these things
my countrymen, and let your Patriotifin appear
by your conduct.

Paris, March 20. A meifenger extraordinary
sent from the Northern Department has brought
to the National Aflembly intelligence of the most
afflicfting kind from Douaj. The seizure of a
boat full of corn gave rife to a dreadful commo
tion; and to quell which the troops of the line
being brought ouc, refufed to obey their com
inlander. The municipality being unwilling to
declare the martial law, the fury of the insur
gents had full scope for its execution ; and two
of the national guards, who wished to interfere
in the riot, were suspended at the fatal lantern
post. The members of the deparsment, terrified
at chefe proceedings, would not flay any longer
in the town, but fee off to hold their fittings at
Lisle.
Philadelphia, May 25.
In arbitrary governments, there are no " fixed principles," whether
the adminiftratton be in the hands of the one, ihefew, or the many
It is efll-ntial to a free government iha there thould be " fixed prin
ciples" ia its conflitution : The jorm of theConftitution may be al
tered, modified, and adapted to particular circumstances ; but the
great principles always remainâthey are unchangeable : These
principles refpeft the unalienable rights of man in all possible fi
xations, whether in a civil or savage state : They exist indepen
dent of government, or societyâare ins-parable from a /late of
freedom, and are therefore the basis of every free Constitutionâ
they refpea the rights of the minority as well as the majority, and
cannot be " annihilated" without the interpolation of despotic
power.
With all the guards to libeity that can poflibly be devised,
such is the prevailing influence of riches, honors and pteajures, that
mankind in all ag?s have facrificed their precious rights and pri
vileges to gratify their appetites for these baubles: And it is in
vain to talk, of equal rights, ar.d of constitutions, to a people who
are uninformedâfor as an enlightened people can never be ensla
vedâso it is impoflible that an ignorant people can long continue
fr Â«- âWhat is the duty then of real patriotism ; Is it to cry aloud
that Liberty is in danger, when every man fits quietly and securely
underhis own vine and fig-tree, having i,one to make him afraid f
Is it to pretend extraordinary zeal in the cause of freedom, while
no exertions are made to place the people out of the reach of ty
ranny, by addingto the bleflings of liberty, the means of perpe
tuating the invaluable inheritance ? The following extradl from
Dr. ADAMs'Defence of the American Constitutions, on this point,
will remain a monument of his penetration and philanthropy, so
long as genuine patriotism is conlidered a virtueâUe observes,
" The inftruftion of the people in every kind of knowledge that
canbe of use to them in the prafticeof their moral duties as men,
citizensand christians ; and of their political and ciril duties as
members ol society and freemen, ought to be the care of the pub
lic, and of alf who have any (hare in the condu6t of its affairs, in
a manner that never yet has been praftifed in any age or nation :
The education here intended, is not merely that of the children
o. the rich and noble, but of every rank amJ clafjof people, down
to the lowest and poorelt: It is not too iitSfch to fay, that schools
or the education of all should be placed at convenient distances,
and maintained at the public expence." In this way, and this
only, can we provide fuflicicnt checks to a baneful aristocracy,
wnich is always disposed to monopolize the avenues of knowlege
to the exclusion erf the great mass of the people. No greater fole
cilm can exist, than that a man (hould be a friend to Freedom
and at the fame time opposed, or indifferent to the
means of learning among the people, except it be this, That a
friend to an universal inftruftion of the people, in the knowledge
of their sacred, civil, and political rights, (hould at the fame time,
be an enemy to public liberty !

ExtraH oj a Utter f,em a laly in Chtrltjlm, to heirffiend in this city,
" O nr city lias been iniuch a bustle all this week,
and every body so much taken uji with our be
loved President, that little or nothing like busi
ness has been done, as you will fee by the news
papers 1 fend yon. He arrived lalt Mondayâand
was received with every pofiible demonltration
of joy ; almost every body went to fee him, ea
ger to have a fight of a man they so much loveâ
I went among the reft ; tho 1 had seen him so
often, I wished to have one more look, as tis pro
bable it will be the last time.
On Wednesday evening he honored the cor
poration ball with his company ; the collec
tion was very large and brilliant indeedânear
ly 2 Jo ladies, elegantly drefledâmany wore sash
es and ribbons 011 their heads with his picture
painted on them, and different inlcriptions in
gold and silver letters, pertinent and fentiinental.
When he entered the room joy sparkled in
every countenance ; but more I'o when, after
being seated a few minutes, he rofs, went all
round the room and bowed to every ladyâthis
gave particular fatisfa&ion, as every one was
anxious to have a good view of him. The city
hall was elegantly prepared for this occasion ;
The pillars were all entwined with laurel and
flowers. On Thursday the Governor gave a
public dinner, and in the evening there was a
concert, given by the St. Cecilia Societyâat which
the number of ladies exceeded those at the ball.
The President dined with the Governor,
and passed the whole evening at the concert
he gratified the company greatly by frequently
star.ding up, and with charming ease and digni
ty walked about the room anticipating the willi
es of every spectator. On his entrance, and ac
his retiring, pieces prepared for the occasion
were performed. The heartfelt fatisfatflion de
pid;ed on every countenance, was reflected from
one which beams with benignity on all.
The bells have been ringing and gnns firing
every day since his arrival ; yesterday howevei"
was pretty quiet as lie dined at a private din
ner with Major Butler. This day he is to dine
with the merchantsâand on Monday next he
takes his departure for Savanna ; May every
protecting angel be his guardian."
Asa iyiuptooi that a more enlarged plan of po-
Hey will in future be adopted by the Britifli go
vernment, leave has been given to bring a bill
into the House of Commons, for the relief of
the proteiling Roman Catholics, by a repeal of
thefeveral penal laws against them now in exist
ence. This motion met with little or no oppo
sition even from the minister.
We are left, by the latest foreign prints, to
wander in the wilds of conjecture as to Eui'opean
news and politics. It seems the Grand Seignior
has sworn that he will not make peace with Ca
tharine, till she has expiated for her cruelties at
Ifmael ; we do not learn whether his fubjedts
have sworn to support the oath taken by Aclimet;
some accounts wear a different appearauce so
that as to peace between Ruilia and the Porte,
we are just at the point we fat out from months
agoâuncertain.
It seems to be very problematical what part
Great-Britain means to take in this war whe
ther coercive, mediatorial, or neutral ; it is
probable that Catharine will pursue her objedl
without consulting any of the other powers
meantime the stock-jobbers mull have something
to form the basis of fpeculatien, and whether
Great-Britain Jhall interfere or jiot P appears the
most obvious question for the momentâthis be
ing the cafe, nothing but positive jafts can be de
pended upon in all that we read on the fubje<ft.
With refpe<st to French affairs, the English
papers giÂ«e accounts of various infurre&ions in
the provincesâbut they appear to be merely lo
cal and temporaryâand have no important af
petft on the revolutionâso far from this, it does
not appear that there has ever been in contem
plation any fei'io'us plan of a counter-revolution
and perhaps to this hour all the oppofiiion that
has been made to the decrees of the national af
fenVbly, has not been more than was neceflary to
keep alive the fire of patriotifin. This was re
markably the cafe in these United States at the
commencement of theconteft with Great-Britain
âIn some States there was a greater proportion
of dftaffetfion to the cause of liberty, than in
others, but the whole quantum produced and
kept alive, a watchful, vigorous and animated
oppofuion, which finally carried us to the con
fum niation of our wishes. It is the prayer of all
good men, and of Americans in particular, that
the cause of freedom in France may obtain a
compleat and glorious triumph, and that the es
tablishment of a free and equal constitution in
that great empire may forever blast the hope!
of defpotifin both in Church and State.

THE Legiflalure of the State of Conne&icut, at their session in

Subject to a dedu&ion of twelve and a half per cent.
The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
quire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven ; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful situation is not surpassed, if equalled by any ; be
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the lound
but by reaion of the flats, this wharf is necessarily extended to the
channel, where ships can load and unload ; and when com pleat
ed, will be the moil extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3~4ths of a inile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towils adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general with that prevails in the minds of all classes of people, for
thefuccefsof this enterprise, together with the very great advan
tage which this scheme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet published in
America) induce the managers to believe the tickets wi-11 meet with
a speedy sale.
The drawing will positively commence at the State-House, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortnnate numbers will be publiflied, and the prizes
paid on demand, by the managers. Those prizes not called for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as given
for the ufc of the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.
