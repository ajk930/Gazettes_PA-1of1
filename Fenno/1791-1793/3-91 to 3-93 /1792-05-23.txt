GEORGE WASHINGTON,

NEW-YORK, May 18
Striflures on the Report of a Committee of Congressf f
on the Wefterti Expedition.
IN my notification to the public of the ijth inft.
I'promifed to expose Come palpable errors ill
the report of the committee of Congress on the
late western expedition, in order that a proper
judgment might be formed ofthislegiilativembde
of investigation. But previous to my entering
on the fubj'ed't, it is proper to observe, that 1 was
never, direc'tly or indiretftly, called upon by the
committee to furnifh any explanations, or to ob
viate any of the charges or insinuations contain
ed in this report: that the firft notice 1 had of"
it, was in Mr- Childs's paper of the 12th instant,
nnd that unfufpefling, unheard and unproteiled, I
have been ltretched on the rack of public inveA
ligation, as an objedl deferring' popular refent
inent. 1 But though, from circumltances arising
from 'misfortune and indifcretioii, (not guilty)
my person has been imprisoned, my mind pre
serves in full vigor its native freedom and inde
pendenceânor am I yet so debased, as tamely to
crouch under the lafli of injury, whilst I am sup
ported by the consciousness not only of inno
cence, but of merit, in those particulars which
are made the fubjedi of accusation.
1 fliall now proceed to a confederation offome
of the points, which the committee roundly as
sert as fadts, reserving to a future occasion, such
evidence and observations, as I fliall judge ne
cellary for a full refutation of every part of the
report of the committee, so far as it relates to
my conduct, as contractor for the army.
In order to prove my inattention to the fulfil
ment of the duties of my station, it is avertedâ
That on the 9th of May, 1791, Mr. Smith atCar
lifle, one of my agents, had no: received any mo
nies from me; that 011 the Bth of May, 1791,
Mr. Kean, another commiH'ary, was in the lame
situation ; and that even so late as the 9th of
June of the fame year, General Nevill, niy prin
cipal agent at Pittsburgh (which was the place of
general rendezvous and deposit) had likewifere
ceived 110 monies.
pro tempore of the Senate.These assertions I aver to be groundless ; and
in proof, I refer to the following copies of re
ceipts, the originals of which are deposited with
Mr. Laban Bronfon, at 57, in Maiden-Lane, for
merly one of my agents under the contract, for
infpecflion of those who may wilh explicit fatis
faiftion on this head.
No. t. Received, Carlisle, 2(1 April, 1791, of
Colonel William Dner, by the hands of Colonel
George Gibfon, five hundred dollars, on account
of provisions to be farnifhed by me to the army
of the United States.
Signed,
500 Dollars.
No. 2. Received, Philadelphia, April 19, 179 1 Â»
of William Duer, Esq. three hundred dollars, in
poll notes, which I proniife to deliver to Mr.
James Smith, near Carlisle, taking duplicate re
cepts therefor.
Signed, HIPPOLITE MALARTIC.
N. B. The receipt of this sum is acknowledged
in Mr. Smith's account.
No. 3. Received, April 17th, 1 791, of Colonel
William Duer, four hundred and seven dollars
and forty-eight ninetieths, on account of sup
plies for the troops raising at Winchester in
Virginia. Signed, JOHN KEAN.
No. 4. 13th April, 1791, Received of William
Duer, two thoufana dollars, to be applied in pur
chasing supplies for the troops on the western
frontiers, and for which I promifeto account.
Signed,
2000 Dollars.
Exclusive of the above sums, I paid many of
Mr. NeviU's drafts, previous to the time at which
the committee flat eel he had received no money,
as will appear by his account, deposited with Mr.
Bronfon, and made large advances to several
other persons, for supplies, to be furniflied at
Pittlburgh, and other places ; the proofs of which
are too voluminous to be inserted in this publi-
cation.
Here I might reft the defence on these points,
but the following proofs of a more decisive an
ture, from J to 9, prove how much I had at heart
an honorable fulfilment of my contract; and
that the measures which I took for this purpose,
â were not only fuccefsful, but acknowleded by
-public documents, lodged in the war office, which
the committee might have seen, if an impartial
investigation had been the object of their re
searches.
No. J. Inftrutftions to Laban Bronfon
Sir,
The confidence I have, from pad experience
in your activity, and regard for my interest, has
induced me to appoint you my principal agent
for managing all purchases on my account in the
vveltern country, not only on account of the con
trail, but on account of the French emigrants.
7n managi the former, yon will a<ft accord
ing to your own discretion, and for my best in
terefl ; in the latter, you will from time to time
govern yourfelf by such special inftrudions as you
lhall receive from me.
Your principal and immediate attention must
be devoted to fupplyin'g all the potts under the
contraA for the space of four months and pro
curing a complete supply of salted provisions for
the months of May and June next, preferring
pork, if you can obtain it. To enable you to
commence your operations, you have herewith
in Philadelphia bank bills, fifteen hundred dol
lars, and a letter of credit on my agent Mr. Jo
seph Hardy, at Philadelphia, directing to pay
your drafts on him, drawn at not less than ten
days fight, for i;oo dollars. You have likewise
an order on Mr. Ludlow, directing him to pay
into your hands what monies he may have undis
posed of, of my last remittance, and all that he
fliall receive from the French emigrants, who are
under a convention to pay me for provisions sup
plied them. With these resources, and that of
the merchandize in the care of Mr. Swan (and
who must dispose of them under your directions
solely) I have no doubt you will be able to exe
cute the objetfts entrusted to you. If further
means are necefl'ary, inform me instantly, and
you lhall have them.
Immediately on your arrival at Buffaloeor Fort
Pitt, you will give notice to Gen. Harmarofyour
commission, the profpetfsyou have, andtheroea
fures you propose adopting, and you will at the
fame time transmit to me the fame intelligence.
From the funds entrusted to Mr. M'Fat land
previous to his death, and those in the hands of
Mr. Fowler, I am persuaded considerable supplies
mud have been procured. Obtain, as soon as
possible, for me, a state of all purchases or con
tracts made on my account and of the deliveries
in confluence, fpecifying the special nature of
the deliveries, and the polls at which they htive
been received. This you will obtain through
Mr. Israel Ludlow, who is appointed to superin
tend all the iflues, and whose province it will be
to \ifit the refpeftive ports. Although from
Capt. Mills' letter to me it is mod probable that
a fufficient supply has gone to Port Vincennes,
yet it will be neceHary to ascertain this circum'-
stance with precision, and to supply any deficien
JAMES SMITH
JOHN NEVILL
cy in such mode as you may think jnoft advifea
ble.
In short, fir, in executing the business intrud
ed to you, you will consider yourfelf unfettered
by any other considerations than a regard to my
interest which is inseparable from an honorable
fulfilment of my contra# : and you will use eve
ry exertion to retrieve any loss of credit, or re
putation which 1 may have fuffered from the fate
of Mr. M'Farland, or from the scandalous insi
nuations of such persons as wish my contract to
fail.
As the season of the year renders the executi
on of the office you have undertaken extremely
fatiguing, and detaches you from the private
pursuits you had in contemplation, I will allow
you for two months service which you have pro
mi led to devote to me, one hundred dollars per
month, exclusive of your reaf&nable travelling
charges, and before the expiration of that time
I will think of a proper charadierto succeed you.
You have herewith a special coinmiffion for the
purposes mentioned in those inftruÂ»fiions, which
you will communicate when circuinftances may
render necellary, and a general letter of credit
to Mr. Willis at Buffaloe, who I doubt not will
give you any aid in executing the trust reposed
in you. 1 am, &c. yours with esteem,
Wm. DUER.
Mr. Laban Bronson
In order that some parts of this letter may be
more clearly understood, it isneceflary to menti
on that it was written in consequence of a for
mer agent's sudden death ; and the efFetft which
it was fuppoled it might have on the fuppliesof
the army at a very critical period, the Ohio ri
ver was frozen that year much earlier than usu
al ; a small part of the neceflary supplies had
been sent down previous to that event, and a
clamarous representation had been made to the
heads of the Treasury and War departments, of
my utter inability to supply the contradl.
From what quarter, and with what views those
representations were made ; I lhall probably
have occasion to shew at a future period.

GOOD AND WHOLESOME PROVISIONS, but that GREAT QUANTITIES
OF PROVISION WERE ON HAND.
4th. That after the return of the army from the expedition,
ar.d only nineteen days previous to the expiration of my con
446
dust, which was on the 3 (ft day of December last, 430 ban
of flour, and. 30, 000 lbs. of beef were on hand at headquarter"
for a garrison of 600 men; which is equal to 122 davs fuonlv
of flour, and J3 of meat. It is unneceflary to mention my
fupphes ot beef, because the reporter acknowledge a pleuti
ful supply of meat : this article being furnilhed from Ken
tucky, is not included in the Pittsburgh returns.
tJhere remain two other cnarges, which require some no-
One, that there a total failure in the supply of horse,
which occasioned the commander in chief to direct i "iurchafe
of betwixt fix and fe veil hundred, for which he ordered mv
a-ent to draw bills on me, and of which I refufed payment
This charge, so far as it refpefts my failure, is as void of foun
dation as the other : But, at present, I (hall content mvlelf
with observingâ
lit. That previous to the order issued by Gen. St Clair
Mr. Wilkinsan agent specially employed for this purpose'
was purchasing the number of horses which was judged necel
fa?y for the expedition, when I undertook the supply ; and
that this circumstance was publickly known in camp. '
2d. That I have made attual payment manymonths since
for all the horses purchased by this gentleman, agreeably tÂ»
my contract with himâand
Lastly. That the loss of borfes, and any interruption in the
regular supply of flour, is not imputable to the causes stated
by the committee ; but to some of a very different nature and
for which I am not responsible ; and that probably this want
of flour existed principally on the retreat, after the victors had
got pofleffion of all the pro-vifionâlf the limits of a riewfpa
per would admit of my introducing the whole testimony ne
ceflary to support those points, in that inconteftible manner
which it is in my power to do, other obvious considerations
restrain me from it at this time, I recnlleft on this occasion
an observation made by Dr. Franklin to Mr. Morris, when fu
perintendant of the finances, on a controversy about money
with the Count of Vergennes, in which, after stating the
CouMt's objections, the Doctor Ihrewdly observes, that he
could have easily refuted all he had said, but that if he had
GOT THE BETTER OF THE ARGUMENT, he fllOuld have GOT NO
THING ELSE. I lhallconclude on this head with observing that
the truth of this charge may easily bejudgedof, by the ac
curacy OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE REPORT OF THE COM
MITTEE On those points where the means of official evidence,
in direct opposition to what they have stated, were within
their reach. As to the last point concerning the due bills is
sued by my agent, and which is the only remaning one which
deserves any comment, I lhall be but short.
The report state s as an article of the contrail, " that the officer*
had an eleitionof drawingthe whole of the rations, to which their
rank entitled them, or of receiving the contrail once of them, in
cash, &c. &r. This is not Jo. There is not a [ingle article of t his
kind, or a Jingle exprejfion in my contrail, which can he tortured
to i mply such an engagement â In proof of this, my original con
trail is left wtth Mr. Bronfon for the perusal of those who with
to be fatisfied as to the truth of this bold assertion. Indeed such
an obligation would be too absurd for any contractor to fubjeil
himfelfto; âfor if this eleilion was to be in the officers of ait
army, as the Contractor could not know when their fancy or
wants might lead them to prefer one to another, he would be un
der the neeeffity of double advances for the fame objeil ; one for
the officers rations, theoMeruf cajh to pay for sfiem, if not de
manded, and what would be still worse, he would not only run
the risque of having the undra Â«vn rations on his hands, but if he
paid for them at the contrail price, have according to an old fay
ing, his labor Jor his pains. All tfiat has ever been usual ill thiscafe
has been for the officers, and Contrailor to agree : which has
generally been done by allowing in cash, not the contrafl price, but
what the ration was c/liinateito coj at the place where the officers
were entitled to receive it ; this order originated in an intention
to make me pay to the officers what they had no right to exad; as
will appear by the following extrail of my agent's letter to mc
on this fubjeil, dated Sept. 26th, 1791.
" General St. Clair has ordered the quarter maflrr of the dif
ferent battalions to include all the rations allowed the officers in
their returns, and direiled the commifTaries to iflue due bills for
the rations not drawn, which it is expeiled will be paid by you.
I should be glad you would give me your direilions on this head,
and let me know at what rate they are to be paid ; for I done
think you ought to fettle them at the contrail price ; there is no
clauje in the contraQ that can oblige you to do it.''
Such are the charges and insinuations made againfl me by the
committee ; and such the evidence I offer to invalidate themâlf
it be asked how Congrels come to direil a publication of this na
ture, tending to criminate individuals without knowing in what
manner the charges againfl them had been fubflantiated, I reply
that the report was foifled in the lafl day of the session, when ma
ny members were absent, and the imagination of the few present
so much on the wing homewards as to prevent the exercifc of
that cool refleilion which in general marks the proceedings of
that refpeilable body : l( Thus wretches hang, that jurymen may
dine." As to the motivesof the reporters they appear fufficicnt
ly obvious. I presume they thought it confiflent with policy
and even with established precedent, that on this occasion some
viilim should be marked out as an objeil of popular resentment.
It would not do to charge Congiefs as the author of the calamity,
because they are Joulbirds which bewray their own nejls.
It would not do to charge the President fat least direflly) be
cause his unremitted attention in executing with the mofl Icrupu
lousexailuefs as well as ability, every pait of his executive func
tions, and a conviilion of this on the public mind preclude a 1
hopes of success from such an attempt. It would not do to charge
general St. Clair; firft, because a former committee of Congrels
had made a very sorry figure in such an attack : â
And secondly, because h.e was present to vindicate h Imfclf -
Who then so proper to attack as mylelf ?âNoneâFirft, because
was a Contrailor : and Contrafto's, from custom immcmoria..
always bear the blame of loft battles ; Secondly, bccaufe iny mi
fortunes had fubjeiled mc to popular prejudices, and of cour e it
was no great crime to charge me with an additional burt en , n
laflly, because I was absent, and of course not capable ol defend
ing myfclf.
In these points of view (if I may be permitted to use a 1
jocularly a graveobfervationof the committee, arid pel .aps v*
as much propriety at leafl as thev do) their order of a P
pears to have been judicious and their ground of aflionwc c ojin.

FUNERAL OF LEOPOLD THE SECOND
ON Friday the 3d inft. the body was opened in
the ptefence of the Imperial pbyficians and
embalmed. The heart was pat into a diver urn,
and the entrails into a brass kettle.
On Sunday at half an hour after two, the A a
lie Parson consecrated the body, and it was car
lied to the Aulic church, preceded by some Au
guftin and Capuchin Friars.
The valet de chambre of the deceased carried
the kettle with the entrails, and another the
goblet with the heart, both covered with black
taffety.
The body was in an open coffin, dreft in a black
robe laced, the head was covered with a hat a
dorned with blue imperial feathers, and the body
decorated with all the orders of knighthood.
When it arrived at the Aulic church, which was
hung overall in black, with imperial elcutcheons,
the body was again consecrated, and placed on the
Lit de parade in the middle of the church, having
on each fide velvet culhions with the imperial â 
crown, sceptre and orb, called the Apple of the em
pire. Mafles were read till noon, at which the
foreign minillers, privy counsellors, and the no
bility of both sexes attended.
The public, who had liberty to pass through
to fee the body, were told by an exempt on pa(-
sing, " Das is der Kcizer"âth*t is the Emperor.
On Monday, at one o'clock in the afternoon,
the heart, after being consecrated again, was
taken up by the two eldetl valets de chambre,
two other eledl chamberlains, and a detachment
of eight German and Hungarian life guards, and
removed to the Auguftin church, received by the
priors and the monks of the monastery, and
placed in the vaults. ...
Immediately after the entrails being conse
crated anew, with the fame attendance as the
heart, were removed by the Bishop, the Chapter
and the Clergy, carried down to the vaults, and
deposited with the usual forms and prayers.
On the 6th, at fix in the afternoon, the fune
ral procession went out of the church, and after
having crofled the hospital, proceeded to the Ca
puchin church.
At seven o'clock the body was taken off the
bier by the valets de chambre ; the coffin was
then (hut, and the beneditfion performed by the
court chaplain, assisted by the matter of ceremo
nies, and the other chaplains, in presence of the
pages, carrying lighted torches, and attended by
the life-guards, lord chamberlain, mailer of the
horse, and three captains of the guardsâit was
put into a mourning coach, glazed all round, and
drawn by fix horses. The procession then crofled
Jofephus square to the Capuchin church.
The Capuchin church was prepared for the
funeral, as follows : _
In the middle the bier was raised fix feet high,
â with a black velvet canopy over it, tringed with
gold, and adorned with the Imperial eagle at
each corner.
Round the coffin was placed the rega.ia betore
mentioned, with thd field marshall s llaff, hat,
sword and scars. On the eight steps of the bier
there were three hundred and seventy-two silver
candlesticks, and at the corner silver pyramids,
with seventy-two wax tapers each.
The whole church was hung in black, with
eighty candelabres divided by coats of arms, and
forty-five lustres.
The high altar was covered with a rich em
broidered cloth, having the Imperial coat of arms
trimmed round with mourning, and one thou
sand seven hundred lights round it.
The mourning commenced the sixth, and is or
dered to be continued fix months.
PARIS, March 17
The Auflrian party is completely vanquiflied
for this time, and the only ministers remaining
in office, who are not either difmifled, or who
have not given in their resignation, are M. Du
port de Tertre, and M. Tarbe, and there was
even a rumor that M.Duport has also given in his
resignation. It remains to be seen what will be
the iffiie of this c'ontelt between the Court and
the Aflembly.
M. Deleflart has set out, under a guard of the
Gens d'Armerie, to Orleans, to take his trial be
fore the high court appointed for the trial of Hate
prisoners.
M. de Taleyrand and Perigord, arrived at Pa
ris on Saturday last.
The King has given the red ribband to M. de
la Fayette, M. Maillardot, and d'Erneft.
In the fitting of the National Aflembly on Fri
day last, a letter was read, which states that
Avignon and Aries are in a state of revolt, ad
vanced guards being ported round the latter
place, the walls of which aricompleatly furnifh
ed with cannon ; two thobfand patriots have
been obliged to leave Avignon; the paflage of
Durance was <hut against a battalion of the Na
tional Guards marching to the frontiers ; the
white flag was hoilted, and the patriots were
threatened with a maflacre.
The National Guards of Montpelier,Marfeilles,
Nimes and Orange, were however upon tlie point
of marching when this letter left the Department
du Guard, and the rebellious citizens of Avignon
and Aries were shortly expected to be quelled.
The regiment of Latnark, and a detachment of
the former place, are as much fufpetft
cd of anti-constitutional principles.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
THE new import law, which has lately patted, was strenu
ously oppoled. Some of the objections were not without
force. It was said, enough is already drawn from impost. It
was replied, this is true of many imported articles, but many
others will bear more ; and it will be ufefnl to our landed and
manufacturing intereits to raise the rate of duties on the latter.
The additional duties ad valorem will ceale with the Indian
war. The urgent necellity ot the public requires the further
revenue, yet it were to be wished that the revenue laws might
have remained fixed, as every change is embarrafling to trade.
Besides, low duties fall on the profits of trade, but increasing
the rate, overcomes old habits of buying and felling, and
throws the duty on the consume it should be. Ihe
merchants will therefore pay only as consumers, and the cre
dits given for the duties, will not deprive them of their trad
ing capital, by paying the duties before they have received them
of the corifumer.
The obj eft ions above noticed, answers to which are just
hinted, are refpeCtable. It is prejumed, however, that with
the candid and discerning, they will yield to a lenfe of the ur
gency of* the occasion, as well as to the other considerations
which have been noticed. # #
But other arguments were urged against the impost, which
belong to the unanswerable class. It was said, without laugh
ing, the additional duties are intended for the Indian war
and you ought to confine your views to the obtaining money
for that end onlyâvet, behold, you afford advantage to the
farmers, by encouraging the production of flax, hemp, cotton,
and various other things. The manufacturers also receive
protection and encouragement âand to make all these the more
effectual, you make the law on all the articles except those
charged at 7g per cent, ad valorem, permanentâthat is, a j
standing law, to be repealed when you no longer like What
an outrage against republican liberty 1 and on this topic a few
hundred dozen high flourifhes were made. The public has had
opportunity by reading the newfapers, to admire the good fenle
and moderation of this part of the debate. The cod-fifhery
too was accused of picking the pockets of the people a second
timeâbecause the law for encouraging that fifhery allows the
money which is paid into the treasury for the fait used in cur
ing the fi(h that is sent out of the country, to be paid back to
the owners of the fifhing veflels, in the form of a bounty on
the tonnage of the veflels. All other articles, on being ex
ported, are allowed to drawback the duties they have paid;
the law making a like allowance to the filliing veflels was called
partial and urtjuftâthat was the firft picking of pockets by
the filheryâand as the late law raises the duty on fait, the
principle of the fifhery law required that a further allowance,
in nature of a drawback, lhould be made, in order that the
owners of the filliing veflels might stand on the fame footing
with other citizens exporting dutied articles. Accordingly the
new impost law allows a further sum to those veflels, equal to
the increase of the fait duty. By the Constitution, every ar
ticle is to be exported duty freeâ(alt fifh may now be export
ed duty freeâand this was not only called a partial favor, but
it was strenuously insisted to be a violation of the Constitution.
Another odious design of the new impost law, is to form a
finking fundâlb that the surplus revenue lhall be applied to
buying up the public debt. This called forth no small powers
of eloquence. The debt is hatefulâthe means of paying it off
are hatefulâ is improper, in this way and in that
way. There is no manner of doubt that there is the most per
fect consistency of design in those who fay the debt is great, is
increasing, and to be diminished, and yet oppose the rais
ing and applying a revenue to finking it as fact as possible!
The public will be edified, no doubt, by the arguments
against the impost law. It was said, all Â¥ou want is money for
the Indian warâand behold, you have rambled over the whole
field of politics to pick up other objeCts of legislation. You
encourage the farmer, the manufacturer, and the fifhery, and
you provide means for diminifliing the public debt. This was
called entangling the bill with foreign matter, and undertak
ing to do half a dozen things at once. Besides all which, the
objeCt of the Indian war is temporary, and your aCt is a stand
ing law.
The force of this censure seems to lie hereâyou should make
an aCt for one or two years. Then the merchants would have
the plague and vexation of the law, and would find it impossi
ble to make their arrangements on such ground. The far
mers would not produce, nor the manufacturers work up the
raw materials of the country, because an aCt for a year or two,
which would expire with the Indian war, would afford no en
couragement to engage in any new production or branch of
bufinels. A law which would take every man's money, and
yet would proteCt no man's industry as a farmer or manufac
turer, would have no friends or advocates. And all good
citizens being found to hate revenue laws, there is no manner
of doubt that a law on the footing which was contended for,
would be fufliciently detested.

Hamtramck, commanding officer of Post Vincennes, on the

pacific agreement with the Wea and Eel River Indiansâand
it was expected that the Pyankefhas would become parties
thereto, These tribes, with their subdivisions of villages,

ExtraEl of a letter from a gentleman cf the JirJl information at Lijbon,
to his correspondent tn this city, dated, March 18.
After certain intelligence had been received at Gibraltar
that Mnley Yazid had defeated his brother's army on the 12th
of last month, about the end of the fame month the unexpect
ed news arrived there of his having died on the 16 th, in con
sequence of his wounds *. as likewise the death of his anta.;on
ift, Muley Ifliem, who is reported by some to have been killed
in the battle ; and by others, to have died also ol the wounds
he received in battle'. What is aflerted to be less doubtful is,
that Muley Iflama has actually been proclaimed emperor at
Tangier. He is also alferted to be a much more unexcep
tionable character than the two brothers who have fallen, and
more likely to cultivate peace, upon reasonable terms, with
all nations. âThe fame letter mentions the 22d instant as the
day agreed upon for the delivering upon of Oran to the regen

FROM CORRESPONDENTS.
Many true friends of liberty spin an over-fine thread of rea
soning, rather beyond the strength of the ftuflf. They Ihew
how trade produces wealthâand wealth, luxuryâand this
again, corruptionâand corruption destroys liberty. In this
way we may conjure up ten thousand apparitions ! -Some
astronomers in Europe, of the last century, lived very misera
ble lives, because they found by calculation that within two
million two hundred thousand years, a comet would run bounce
against our earth, and either singe or crack it to its total ruin;
so that it would be no longer a world fit to live in. 1 hose
that fear this ruin of liberty, fliould establish public free
fchools, and support good laws, which will produce good mo
rals, and these will preserve the public liberty and virtue, as
long as human means can have any efficacy on human affairs.
The yeomanry of the country are often addrelTed on the
fubje<st of the many wrongs they fuffer from the national go
vernment. One of the complaints which is made for them is,
that the duty on the tonnage of foreign vefTels is an injury to
the landed interest. Half a dollar a ton on a vessel is alledged
to be a grievous imposition, and discouraging to the free iale
of our produce. Supposing this duty to be lome discourage
ment to purchaiers coming from foreign parts to carry off our
produce in their own veflfels, it operates in an equal degree to
encourage the employment of our own Hiips to go in search of
a market. The power at any time to seek the market, and
to chufe the best of several, affords better encouragement to
the sale of the articles of our farms, than they would meet
with if wÂ« were obliged to depend solely or principally on fo
reigners.
Be fides, the increase of ships and seamen is elTential to the
landed interest in cafe of a war, as the protection of our staple
articles by sea could be no otherwise depended on.
On the whole, the landed men will have no cause to com
plain. It is also very agreeable, to a liberal mind, to observe
that the interests of the northern and southern dates, in this
particular, perfe&ly accord, and are reciprocal.

THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in New- Jerfey,occupied for many years paftby
the fubferiber; containing upwards of 200 acrcs of land, besides
a tract of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main street leading from
Trenton to Lamberton, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
off in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the said street on the eait, and by the river on
the weft, forms a square; which, from the combined effect of fili
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the mott
beautiful and desirable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-iinilhed brick building, 50 by 40, containing fo'jr
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick
kitchen ; and commanding ? very extensive and pleasing view of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the falls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements oft
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings are a new fton?
coach-house and stables, fufficient to contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cuiting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining these is a very complete granary,
rat proof, and a stone cow-houle, upwaids of iÂ©o feet in length,
containing thirty-one paved stalls, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, &c. Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is a gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich colleflion of the
choicest fiuits of almost every kind, and several large alparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, weii
built, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheefc-ioom,
spring-house, garden, &c. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
cessary out-building. The ground is properly divided into Jma
fields, all well watered, highly improved, and chiefly under the
most approved grass. This square has produced annually, for c
veral years past, upwards of sixty tons of the be ft hay, hefi (s
supporting through the fuminer season twenty to thirty home
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper sea ons,
with great pl> nty of all kinds of fifh usually found in frclft watCr
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl; both o wmc 1
tnay afford a pleasing amusement to the fporifman, as; we as a
convenient addition to the elegance and variety of his table. c
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is inclosed and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red ce ar -Â«
and rails of chtfnut and white cedar. The purchaser may hav
