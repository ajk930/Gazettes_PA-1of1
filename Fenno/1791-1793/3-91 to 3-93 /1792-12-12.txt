House of Representatives, one of the z\Jl in-

SIR,
Your mojl obedient,
and mojl humble servant,
ALEXANDER HAMILTON,
Secretary of the Treasury,
Th: Honorable the SPEAKER
of the House of Reprefintatives.
In obedience to two Ilefolutions of the
House of Representatives, one of the
%I ft itiftant, dire&ing the Secretary of
the Treasury to report a Plan for the
Redemption of so much of the Public
Debt as by the Ast entitled " An Ast
making Provision for the Debt of the
United States," the United States have
reserved the right to redeem ; the other
of the 22d instant, diredting him to re
port the Plan of a Piovifion for the
R#imhurfement of the Loan made of
the Bank of the United States, pursu
ant to the Xlth fedtion of the Act en
titled " An Adt to Incorporate the
Subscribers to the Bank of the United
States; the said Secretary refpedtfully
submits the following
report.
TH E expediency of taking mea
furej for the regular redemp
tion of the public debt, according to the
right which has been referred to the go
vernment, being wifely predetermined by
the resolution of the Hosfe of Represen
tatives referring the fubjeft to the Secre
tary, nothing remains far him but to en
deavour to feleÂ£t and submit the mod eli
gible means of providing for the execu
tion of that important object.
With this view, the firft enquiry, which
naturally presents itfelf, in, whether the
exiding revenues are or are not adequate
to the purpose ?
*1 he estimates which accompany the re
port of the Secretary of the 14th instant,
will (hew, that during the continuance of
theprefent Indian war, tire appropriations
for mtereft and the demands for the cur
rent service, are likely to exhaust the pro
duct of the exiding revenues ; though
they afford a valuable surplus beyond the
permanent objects of expenditure, which
it is hoped may, ere long, be advantage
ously applied to accelerace the extinguilh
Â®ent of the debt.
In the mean time, however, and until
the restoration of peace, the employment
Â«â¢ at resource t ' l ' s way, malt of ne
Â«Bitybelufpended; and either the bufmefs
redemption mud be dferred, 01 re
course us 11ft; be had to other expedients.
But did no such temporary necessity
or resorting to other expedients exist,
LiV 't would dill be recommend
ed by weighty confiderations.âlt would
a PP ear > in the abftraft, advifeable to leave
the^ surplus of the prelent revenues free,
to be applied to such casual exigencies as
â¢ay, from time to time occur; to occasional
pilrchafes of the debt when not exhausted
by such exigencies, to the payment of in
hered on any balances which may be found
due to particular states upon the general
wtlemwitdf accounts; and finally, to the
payment of iatereft on the deferred part
lhe debt, when the period for such
payment arrives.
Wednesday, December 12 . , "
There is a reasonable prospect, that if
not diverted, it will be found adequate to
the ttvo la it important pnnpofes.
Relinquilhing, then, the idea of an im
mediate application of the present reven
ues to t!ie objedl in view, it remains to ex
amine what.other modes are in the option
or the Legislature.
Loans, from time to time, equal to the
iums annually and bottomed
on the iame revenues, which are now
ppropnated to pay inferett; upon
j. m ?' offer themselves as one expe
c tent, which may be employed with a de
gree of advantage. As there it a proba
bility of borrowing at a tower rate of in
terelt, a material saving \#uldrefult; and
even this tefource, if none better could
Â«. ol, Â£ ht not to fre neg*feed.
But it is obvious, that to rely upon this
rev iree aW would be to do little to
wards the final exoneration of the nation,
lo (top at that point woultf consequently
be neither provident nor fatisfadory.
1 ne interests as well as the expeftat ions
of the Union require something more ef
feaual.
The establishment of additional reven-
the remaining resource. Thii.ifthe
bulmefs is to be undertaken iu eatneft, is
unavoidable : and a full confidence may
reasonably be entertained, that the com
munity will fee with fatisfaftion the em
ployment of those means, which alone can
be HFedtual, for accomplifliing an end, in
itfelf so important, and so much an objedt
of general delite. It cannot fail to be u
niversally felt, that if the end is to be at
tained, the neceflary means mult be em
ployed.
It canonly be expsdted that care be ta
ken to choose such as are iiabie to feyi-cit
dbjedtions, and that in the modifications
of the business in other refpedts, due le
gard be had to the prefsnt and progref
live circumstances of the country.
A (Turning it as the basis of a plan of
redemption, that additional revenues arc
to be provided, the further enquiry di
vides itfelf into the following branches :
I. Shall a revenue by immediately con
ftitated, equal to the full sum, which
may at present be redeemed, according
to the terms of the contrast ?
11. Shall a revenue be conftituted,from
year to year, equal only to the interest
of the fu.u, to be redeemed in each year
âcoupling with this operation an annu
al loan,commenfurate with such sum ? Or,
111. Shall a revenue be constituted each
year, so much exceeding the intend of
the sum to He redeemed as to be fufficient,
within a short definite term of time, 10
discharge the principal itfelf; coupling
with this operation also, an annual loan,
equal to the sum to be annually redeemed,
and appropriating the revenue created to
its discharge, within the term which shall
have been predetermined ?
The firft plan, besides being completely
effectual, would be eventually mod
(economical j but coniidering to what a
magnitude the revenues of the United
States have grown in a short period, it is
not easy to pronounce how far the faculty
of paying might not be drained by any
sudden confiderableaugmentation, whete
foever immediately placed while the ra
pid progress of the country in population
and resource feemsto afford a moral cer-
tainty, that the necessary augmentation
may be made witii conveniences by
fucceflive steps, within a moderate term
of time, and invites to temporary and
partial suspensions, as capable of conci
liating the reasonable accommodation of
thecommunity withjthe vigorous profecuti
of the main design. For these and for o
ther reasons which will readily occur,
the course of providing immediately the
intire sum to be redeemed, is conceived
not to be the mod eligible.
The second plan, though much more
efficacious than that of annual loans, bot-
tomed 011 the revenues now appropriated
for the payment of interest on the sums
to be redeemed, does not appear to be
221
efficaciow. The fchcJule A.

and will be released by pu,-chafes, pursu
ant to provifinns heretofore made, in th
ru'"chafe of 6 per cent flr, c i c . a
ptlncipal equal to 2,043,837 dollar, and
7 cents would be funk, and a clear
annuity, equal to 459,212 dollars and
82 cents would be created, towards fur
ther redemptions; but the fund then ne
cessary for the future progreflive redemp

reserved, would be 1,126,616 dollars and

and 63 cents, the amount of the redeem
'"7 âSo!Â»ifth!nÂ«rar>re effjjftual than
this is certain!-/ dcliiable, and apnears to
be pra&icable.
The laÂ£l of the three plans beÂ£l accords
with the molt accurate view which the Se
cretary has been able to take of the pub
lic interest.
In its application it is of material con
sequence to endeavour to accomplilh theft
two points: I. The complete discharge of
the sums annually redeemable within the
period prefixed, and the reimbursement
within the fame period of all auxiliary
loans which may have been made for that
purpose. H. The confuting by the ex
piration of that period, a clear annual
fund competent to the future redemption
of the debt to the extent of the rijjht re
served.
The period to which it is conceived
the plan ought to refer, is the firft day
i3Â»12 ; htjai.fc bfrctt, i!>c firft
payment, on account ot the principal of
the dtferred debt, may rightfully be made.
In conformity to these ideas, the fol
lowing plan is mod refpedtfully submit
ted : Premising that the sum redeemable
for the firft year of the 6 per cent (lock,
bearing a present interest, ia computed at
550,000 dollars.

account of the principal of the debt. The

A ciriumilance has occurred here, which has
occasioned much alarm. On application front
the Prince of Condr, a person of the name of
I'Eveq'K, who is by ptofcffion a dcntill, and is
eftabhftifd at Strasbourg, has Skcii aoprehrnded
in conft-quencp of a difcoverv having been made
that he was engaged to affdffinate tlie Kin-' of
Pruflia. 0 .
This person has been employed profrflionally,
in the family ot the Duke ol Wui tcmhurg, and
attended the Dutchels in her late visit to the
Princess Ferdinand of PrulTia. Alter he was
laken into custody, he conf.-flcd the truth of (lie
chargeâand added, that he had already received
fifty thouland livres, in part ot the reward which
had been promtfed him for the perpetration of
this horrid crime.
From the measures which are now taking, it
is probable that many additional patticuiais of
this biifmefs will foou be known. It may in the
mean time be considered as an additional evi
dence of the principles by which those aban
doned persons are afiuaied, who have usurped

From this principle, our modern philol'ophcri
are intent on representing their new libertv un
der all Ihe deformity of favagc liceniioufnefj, 111
order that theii disciples may hereafter be
brought to a due admiration of real libertv, as
confident with the happiness of society. Tins
is the only apology we can make for their Of
fering, not to fay encouraging ihofe horrid ciu
tlties which are daily dil'gracing every part of
France.
Every day brings accounts that the new mode
of luminary juflice has laken place in many
parts of the Kingdom. At Lyons all theprifnns

days ago, ihere are more than 500 peifons ar
retted and put in prison withnutany legal aÂ£t of

little thron di error from the true road of pa
triotism, bnt a fine ere friend of the revolution
and jof liberty. Tiiehandof lome inalsonant
aTafiin has taken advantage of this havoc to
gratify private revenge; the profcribers glo
rying in every other deed, but lamenting and
disavowing this. Every precaution is taken
to hinder the repetition of such outrages ; the
feclions have formed a general confederation
among themielves, and each citizen makes
bimfelf re r ponfible for the lofs'and property of
his neighbour; from the in which
this is arranged, together with the patroles
who watch over its execution, the tranquility
of the city is not likely again to be disturbed,
and the seditious are certain of being appre
hended, before any mischievous deiigns can be
carricd into effect.
" Roufleau has alferted, that a revolution
is gained at too high a price, if it costs the
loss of one citizen. This axiom is contemp
tible, because it induces abjedt fubini/fion to
the vilest deipotifm. Liberty may, however,
be purchased at too dear a rate, when honor
and justice are made the facrifice. The ge
neral abhorrence of the are
t.'ie cleateft proofs that both the nationrl ho

every exertion was made by the constituted
powers tc hinder the violation of either.â
Every friend to freedom molt lament, that
its traitors (hould fufl'eranv other punifhnient
than those inflicted by the law, which has, or
ou;;lt to have fufiicientlv avenging powers,
whilst tyrants only are left to all'affinatkins
and proscription.
" Let these who heap undiftinguiflied in

willing to believe it the ast of the nation, re
flect, that li ice the revolution of 17f>9, tiiou

made the principles of any man who has any
attachment to liberty. Let h ; m recoiled, on
the one fide, the maifacres at Nantz, Nifmes,
Montauban, Avignon, Catpentras, and the

spilt by the Court and the ariitocraev ; wbilft,
previous to tiiis event, only one man n.-.dbeen
condemned, Â»nd very tew had fufFered from
the rage of tile people.
" It should be remembered also, that with
the concurrence, nay, with even the itwjta
tion of this court and the ariflocracy at iiojfie,
one hundred and thirty thoul'and Prussians,
Auftrians, Ruffians, and emigrants, had en
tered France; that the Duke of Bru.ifwick
had threatened death to the flighted refiiUnce
and his followers had given serious fpeciinens
of the modes in which they would inflict it, by
cutting off the lioles and ears of the men, and
nailing the lail to their heads; and beiides the
ordinary and allowed cruejties to women,
cutting olf their breasts, and murdering the
infants, &c. that this army was ou its march
to the capital, and had already taken the only
two forts that lay directly on its way ; that
at this moment, the exultation of the arifto
cracv in Paris, became as unbounded, as its
discovery at this time was imprudent, that to
repel rbofe invaders, not only the federates
who were in Paris, but con.lderable detach
ments ot the citizens were preparing to
march, leaving to the meicy of internal foes,
the fate of their and children; under
these repeated provocations, and influenced
by fears which appeared so well rounded, it is
not to be wondered at that so little resistance
was made at firft, to those whose refoiution
had bÂ»en fixed for 10:11 c days to make so ter
rible an example, and in puniihing the guilty
now, furuifh motives to others not again to
provoke so dreadful a vengeance."

AUGUSTA, (Georgia) Nov. 17.
On Monday last the Circuit Court of the
United States for this diftricl, was opened by
the Hon. Thomas Johnson, one of the AfToci
ate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Unit
ed States, and the Hon. Nathaniel Pendleton,
Dill rift Judge of this diftrift.
Four persons, v.*!.o failed from Eofion to
the liland of Martinique, and from thence to
Savannah in May last, were indi&ed and tried
for stealing on the high seas, near the Island
ot Martinique, a number of negroes, belong
ing to inhabitants of that Island; Samuel
Skinner, of Boston, who was supercargo of the
veiiel, and who appeared'to bÂ®
was found guilty by rliejury, on.his own con
fedion, upon the 16th section of the law for
the purifhm'fnt of certain crimes again il the
United State*, and was feotence'd to receive
thirty-nine laihes, to pay a fine of one hun
dred dollars, all lawful charges of the profe
cutlon, and to stand committed till the Sen
tence was complied with. The other three
prisoners, to wit: Nathaniel Hickman, Ro
bert Watts, and Nathaniel Ridgeway, were
acquitted.
Samuel Skinner, pursuant to the above
mentioned sentence, was, on Wednesday last,
publicly whipped at the Market-house in this
town.
We are informed that a party of white man
from the frontiers of this (late, has of late
made an incursion to the Cherokee nation,
burnt one of their towns, and killed three of
their peopleâThat two of seven Indians of
the aforefaid nation, who had been invited in
to the ibttlemeffts to hold a friendly talk con
cerning the late murders by Indian*-, were
killed aÂ£Warc9smill, in Franklin county, and
a the fame time wounded. These
traniacrions are, no dot.bt, considered by the
doers of them, as striking the balance on Ja
va ge accountâit is however aJFuining a great
deal, (to leave humanity and policy out of the
qucftion) for individuals to take u;jon them
lelves to judge (and carry into execution that
judgment) on matters which involve the ge
neral tranquility.
HA R T F O R D, December 3.
A correfphndent retnarks that nothing exhi
bits the human character in a mÂ»re degrading
view, than the violeni attacks made upon the
V ice-Preiident and the Secretary of the Treasury.
That men so bold and diftinguifhcd in the cause
of America during the late icvoluion, so up
right, ingenuous, able, and indefatigable in efta
blilhmg a fyft?m of government and finance for
th? United States, and so much efteeaied and
refprfted bythegr'-at body of enlightened Ame
ricans, that fui ii men fbould be continually abu
lcd, ceniiircd and vilified by a little jattion of
zvtonghcadsy and avowed enemies to the prcfent
ccnftuuticn ot the United States, which has, in
ihiee yeais time, raised us from a wretched
stare of aifcord, and rescued our national cha
ra&er from infamy, is a faÂ£l no lets surprising
then degrading to humsfl nature.
But why abuse the Vicc-pufiderif, that oro
founcl ftatelmanâthat ilr.-dy pqtriot ? Why
abuse the Sccrctary of the Treasury, that di/c. i n
infe upright and pcrftver:ng financier ? Dues
not America rifteafy and fatislicjd with bis ad
miniftratioc ? Let the enemies of our peace be
a (lured that if the u>ijejl oj their leaders were pla
ced at the head of the Treafuiy department, he
uouU not dare to change the prrfent f\jiem of _/f
---tiavce. No man who knows the attachment
which the mass of fublUntial Americans have
for that ryfiem, and their determination is well
a- their powerto support it, would venture uuon
the hazardous cxjMiimrnt, The man or men,
who (hak< put lie credit or overthrow the fyf

To the LADIES or PHILADELPHIA.
NOTHING has tended more to abate the
influence of the fair sex on the manners
ot men, than the prevailin; pradfcice of card
plaving. Formerly, the character of the ate
was principally conformed to the nature of
their favorite occupations, war and hunting.
The foftneÃand fine polity of French man
ners, is coriÃfledly swing to the women
But cards have flopped the progrefj of this
gentle power, and it is doubtful whether we
are not going backward radier than forward.
Talents are cultivated in proportion as they
are valued. It'a Lady has any thin? to fay"
it would interrupt V.'h'ft to fiiy it. If fte has
nothing to fay, the vacancy oi her mind mav
be concealed at the card-table. Wit and fen
ttment are babbling intruders there. They
are unheard, or heard only to disturb the va
cant solemnity of that pantomime Icene. The
potven of converlation rust for want of use
' ' lrds level the diftinAions of undemanding
and education. A common plea ior cards is
they relax the mind when it is overstrained by
attention to bafinef:. This is true enough,
for a,game or two, played for amufemeut and
not for money. But to play for money, is
ftraimng the miod againâit brings up un
friendly and mciti paflionsâit makes beauty
and wit feebie by raising up a set of rival e
motionsâthe fear of ioiing and the hope of
gam. Ihe queen of trumps seems to the
gambler more sparkling than the queen of
heartsâand in fact we fee that a i.ian tired
of business, rerts himfelf by getting more tired
of cards. He plays till midnight, fill his head
akes, h;s temper is soured, his patience and
his money gone, and an itch for play is coâ
trailed, winch brings him every ni.rht to the
gaming-table to lose more money, till lie has
neither money nor merit left.
It depends on the Ladies, and the Ladies
only, to keep this vice, the rival of their
c.iarms, out ofpoiire company. Tboie who
have sense and beauty, e'c iuterefted to do
it; and they are the per'ons to pre/cribe the
regulations oi" manners with the nicll urd-i
---puted authority.

provided for the redemption and extinguifli
ment of die debts. As soon as overtures
were made for purchaiing the requisite amount
of the 3 percent, fteck of the United Slate?,
belonging to Pennsylvania, at the rate ilipj
lated by the a<st of afTembly, I issued t: e regu

you will perceive, from a particular report of
the transaction, which is prepared for your
information, that tiie sales, fcf this object,
have amounted to 986,000 dolJars; which, at
the average price of 12 1-16 in tie pound.has
produced the specie sum of 593,201 dollars &
I cent; that the aggregate of the debts alrea
py redeemed amounts to the sum of 548,988
dollars and 13 cents ; and that there remains
(allowing for certain contingencies) in the
Treasury, the sum of 72,201 dollars and 50
cents, to answer the further operation of the
redemption law, and such new appropriations
as you {hall be pleased to direift. I have found
it impracticable, however, on the terms pre

Our unliquidated demand against the Union,
may, at the fame time be confdercd, as pro
mising an acce,jfion of productive property;
for, although nothing can be precifeJy ascer
tained in this refpeft, until the final settle
ment of all claims of the sister states, the a
gent, on b-half of Pennsylvania, allures me,
that our accounts boar a favorable afpeft, and
that he has reason to believe, that the princi
pal charges which they exhibit, stand, at pre
sent, in a state of approbation. In addition
to these funds, the arrearages of taxes (a
mounting, exclusively of the known exonera

form a considerable, though, from the nature
of the fubjeft, a temporary resource; and the

Four year? are nearly closed since the meet

federal spirit of prophesy, its credit mun be
in a mofr pitiable cafe. The people are so
uncoinpiaifarit, they are so honelt and plain

feelings, that the croakings, forebodings, in
fiuuations, lies and flinders oi'thofe, who de
clared that they would have " a change of men

to be totally disregarded.
What can more fully evince the funeral ap
probation of the people of public measures,
than repeated re-elections of their representa

nation ?
But perfect peace is no more to be expected
than perfect wiidom. Hence the scythe of

luxuriant American foilâleaves many bitter

The men influenced by political and ava

name and character, took advantage of the
ileep into which the people were luK'ed by the
quiet and orderly eib biifhme-nt of our new
government, to low t'ie tafjes of monarchical
principles and predatory Speculations in the
fields where pottlic juflice and public happi

up the Jcif.ionablt do^rrines, that the people
are not the proper keepers of their own liber

that hereditary dignities,pecuniary influence,
?nd military force only, are the only means
whereby they can be kept in nereffarv disci
pline and obedience ; chat public debts are
public bleftings, &;c. with many other exotics
not left poifoneus to the spirit of our repub
lican conflitntions, and the manly independ

his scythe is mowing down t! cfe nox

Jove liberty and the public good to unite in
rooting them out of our country.
As an enlightened people will seldom or ne

N. Carolinalit. The amount of the jfftiuity conili
tuted the' third year, which will have been
liberated by rvimbui fitment of the third
loan.
2d. The arrears of interest not previ
ously appropriated, and which are com
puted at 200,000 dollars. There will con
ff que fitly be a deficiency this year of
810,661 dollars and 27 cents, which will
require to be luppiied by a temporary
loan to be reimbursed out of the surplus of
the fund which on the lit day of January
1802 will exilt for future redemptions,
and which surplus will be fufficient to re
niburfe this temporary loan in aboat thir
teen years and an half.
It may be proper to rematk, that this
deficiency upon one year, is fuffered to
txiit to avoid an unncceffary augmentati
on of revenue, materially beyond the film
permanently requilite. No inconvenience
cnfues, because this temporary deficiency
is rtiade up by the surplus of the perma
nent fund, within the period mentioned.
And that fund, from the 111 January 1802,
is, adequate to all future redemptions, in
the full proportion permitted by the con
trail.
The table in the schedule B, herewith
submitted, will (hew in one view the prin
ciples and operation of this plan.
T)ie schedule C will exhibit the means
of constituting the feveial annuities pro
pofed-to be established. From it, will be
seen, that the proposed annuities are to be
compofl-d, partly of taxes to be fucceflive
ly laid, at the refpeftive periods of cre
ating them, partly of the surplus dividend
to be expected on the (lock belonging to
the government, in the bank of the Unit
ed States, beyond the interest to be paid
on account of it, and partly of the funds
heretofore pledged for the payment of in
terest, which will have been liberated up
on so much of the debt, as will have been
extinguished.
The refpe&ive amounts of the taxes to
I>e severally laid, will be:âln the firft
year 43,199 dollars and 6 cents ; in the
lecond year 109,391 dollars and 60 cents;
in the third year 115,955 dollars and 17
cents; in the fourth year 102,912 dolls,
and 48 cents; in the fifth year 102,743
dollars and 12 cents; in the lixth year
107,680 dollars and 20 cents ; in the se
venth year 109(649 dollars and 32 cents ;
making together 691,530 dollars and 95
cents.
The sum which will have been redeem
ed prior to the firft day of January 1802,
will be 5,443,607 dollars and 37 cents.
The sum redeemable on the firft of Janu
ary 1802, will be 1,126,616 dollais and 44
cents; and the fund which will thenceforth
exist for the purpose of future redemp
tion, (as is particularly (hewn by the
schedule D.) will be 1,210,744 dollars
and 34 cents, exceeding the sum
necefTary by 84,127 dollars and 90 centsâ
a fund, which, including the interest from
year to year liberated, will, as already in
<imated, be completely adequate to the
final redemption of the whole amount of
the 6 per cent, (lock, (as well the defer
red as that bearing a present interest) ac
cording to the right which has been re
let ved for that purpose.
In the mean time, a further impression
will be made upon the debt by the iiiveft
ment of the residue of the funds hereto
fore eftablilhed, in the purchase of it; and
it is hoped, that the restoration of peace
with the Indians will enable the applica
tion of the surplus of the existing revenues,
together with the proceeds of the ceded
lands in our Western Territory, to the
fame These, whenever they can
be biought into adtion, will be important
au.s , materially accelerating the ultimate
redemption of the entire debt. The em
ployment of these resources, when it can be
done by increaling the iatereft-fund, will
proportionably k-flen the necessity of using
the resource of taxation for creatine the
proposed annuities, if the government
ihalll judge it advifeable to avail itfelf of
the fubJlHiitr, which may accrue from that
Circumltance.
Having now glvcn a geaera , y j ew of
the plan, which has appeared upon the
whole the molt eligible, it is necekry in
the next place, to present to the confi
de rat ion of the House the requisite funds
tor commencing the execution of it. These
will embrace a provision for the firft annui
ty only ; that alone requiring, by the
flan, immediate provilion. With regard
to a proviljon for the subsequent annuities,
Which is proposed to be fucceflive, the Se
cretary will content himfeif with this ge
-2S o ?Sr , i , Â°".' th3t He d,TcernÃ no in
tnnftc difficulty ,Â« making provision for
triem, as fail as (hall be ncceflary, with
due convenience to the people, and con
fidently with the idra of abilaining from
taxing lands and buildings(with the stock
and implements of farms) reserving them
as a iefource for those great emergencies,
which call for a full exertion of all the
contributive facilities of a country.
The following means for conltituting
the firft annuity, are refpedifully submit
ted, viz.
Annual surplus of the dividend oa
the ilock of government in the bank
of the United States, beyond thtfintereft
to be paid out of the laid dividend, clti
mated at ' Dollars 60,004
Tax on horses, kept or used for
the purpose of riding or of draw
ing any coach, chariot, phaeton,
chaise, chair, fulkey, or other
carriage for conveyance of personsâ
Excepting and exempting all horses
which are usually and chiefly employed
for the puipofes of husbandry, or in draw
ing waggons, wains, drays, carts, or
other carriages for the transportation of
produce, goods, merchandize, commodi
ties, or in carrying burthens in the course
of the trade or occupation of the persons
to whom they refpeÂ£tively belong,and the
horses of persons in the military service
of the United States, viz.
For every horse not above excepted or
exempted, at the rate of one dollar per an
num, where only one is used or kept by
the fame person ; with an addition of fif
ty cents per annum, per horse, where
more than one and not more than two
horses are kept or used by the fame
personâwith an addition of one dollar
per annum, per horse, where more than
two, and not more than four, are kept or
used by the fame perfon--and with an ad
dition of one dollar and a half dollar, per
horse; per annum, where more than four
are kept or used by the fame person.
Provided, that this addition shall not be
made in refpedt to hoifes usually employ
ed in public (lages, for the conveyancc of
paflengers.
This progteflive increase of rates on
the higher numbers, has refeience to the
presumption of greater wealth which ari
ses from the pofTjffion of such higher
numbers.
The product of this tax will probably
be abont equal to the lefidoe of
posed annuity, which is43 l dollars and
6 cents. How near the truth thiseftimate
may prove, experiment alone can, in f0
untried a cafe, decide. An aid to this
fund may be derived from the surplus di
vidend on the bank stock, for the half
year ending the last of December next,
which, it is presumed, will not be less than
20,000 dollars. Should a deficiency ap
pear, upon trial, it can be supplied by a
future provision. Proper regulations for
the colle&ion of this tax, will, it is be
lieved be found not difficult, if the tax
itfelf shall be deemed eligible. Its sim
plicity has been a considerable recom
mendation of it. Qualified, as it is, it is
not likely to fall on any but such who can
afford to pay it. The exemption from the
tax, in regard to horses which are appro
priated to the purposes of hufbandty, or
of any trade or occupation, or to the
tiasportation of commodities, feeins to
obviate all reasonable objection.
If, however, there should appear to
the legislature, reasons for preferring a
tax on carriages for pleasure, which, it
may be observed, will operate on nearly
the fame description of persons, the sum
required may, it is believed, be produced
from the following arrangement of rates,
viz. Upon every coach, the annual sum
of four dollarsâUpon every chariot, the
annual sum of three dollarsâUpon every
other carriag tfor the conveyance of persons,
having four wheels, the annual sum of
two dollarsâ-and upon everychair, fulkey,
or other carriage for the conveyance of per
sons, having less than four wheels, the an
nual sum of one dollar.
The col.e&ion of this tax will !Â«r as
iimple and easy, and perhaps more cer
tain, than that which has been primarily
fubmrtted. '
With regard to the second obieft re
ferred to the Secretary, namely the plan
of a provision for the reimbursement of
the loan made of the bank of the United
States, pursuant to the Xlth feftion of
,i, .b y whlch is incorporated, thÂ«
following â refpeilfullyfubmitted, towitj
That power be given by law to borrow
the sum due, to be applied to that reim
bursement ; and that so much of the di-
Lank as may be necessary, be appro
224
priated for paying tKe interest of the sum
to be borrowed.
From this operation, it is obvious, thai
a saving to the government will result,
equal 10 thedifferencebetweentheintereft
which will be payable on the new loan and
that which is payable on the sum now
due to the bank.
If the proposed loan can be effected, at
the rate of those la ft made in Holland, the
nett saving to the government may be
computed at the annual sum of 35,000
dollars ; which saving, whatever it may
be, is contemplated as part of the means
for conltituting the proposed annuities.
The benefit of this arrangement will
be accelerated, if ptovifion be made for
the application of the proceeds of any
loans heretofore obtained to the payment
suggested, on the condition of replacing
