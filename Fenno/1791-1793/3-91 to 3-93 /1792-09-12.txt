Philadelphia Uau.y A d v t k i - i s f. k ,
To the Citizens of the United St at a of\
tHil'lCU
THIS Gazette, though on ptiallv priblifhrd un-j
tier ciÂ»'<umftance.s of difcouragmg perplexity,'
has, with the lifipg toitune ot our coun'ry, gra
dually risen to an eminence far beyond the Editor's
expectations.
Encouraged by a generous public, whose rights
ibis paper lias ever been ready to defend, and
whom >t his tiom tunc to time endeavor- d to
lerre, as a tnendly monitor against thole evils toj
which other nations are expoled, it has " grown
with its growth, and itrengthened with its
itrenelh ; rt and this day tiie ninth volume (in
compliance with the wiftics of many vefue&able
citizens) comuientes, on royal paper, ot a fupcrior
quality, and more than double the fixe of that on
which it was fir ft printed in the year 1788.
By the present alteration (which precludes,
however, any farther change) the Editor will be
enabled to gratify the public, with a more copious
fele&ion of 'articles of domeltic and Foreign intel
ligenceâan accurate detail of the debates and pro
ceedings of Corigrefsâa faithful representation of
the progress ot agriculture, manufactures, arts ;mtU
sciences, throughout the Unionâand a ufelul
neation of the chara&er, power, policy, inftitu
rions, and manners of other nations. With a
study proportionate to his conviction of their use- |
fulnefs. he will early announce to the merchants
the multifarious events that concern them. The!
arriva'is and departures of vcflelsâthe course of
exchangeâthe prices current of merchandize and
of stocksâthe regulations of tradeâeach in its
proper will be care<ullv exhibited, with as
great a degree of accuracy as the moil unremitting
Attention can ensure.
It is an advantage peculiar to the Federal Ga-
zette, which cannot b<* too highly estimated, and
which the Editor adds with gratitude to the pre-
sent enumeration, that it is made the medium of
publishing authentic copies of the laws of
the United States, under the authority of the pro
per officer, as soon as the adfcs have received the
legislative fantlion.
Intended as a faithful guardian of the sacred
rights of the community, this paper was warmly
and liberally zealous for the efbhlifhment of that
noble monument of modem civilization, the Con
stitution of the United Spates; and having seen it
fafe from the attacks of its various opponents, and
fucct fsfullv carried into etft-ct, this Gazette, with
equal solicitude for that Conftirutton, will con
stantly endeavor to remove whatever might im
pede its firm ellabiilhment in the hearts and affec
tions of Americans. A Heady advocate for the
diminution of the debts ot the countryâfor the
support of iis creditâand the general dif
fufion of its happiness, the Editor Hatters himOeff
he has contributed bis mite towards the extension
of those sentiments that arc likely to promote mea
sures so fa lot ary : and it is his intention to ihow
equal fidelity, in the maintenance of order and
thefuppoit of good government, on the one hand,
and genuine liberty and lepnblicanitm, on the
other.
Upop this plan, and with* those views, it is
fondly hoped- that the Federal Gazette may serve
as a faithful hillorv of the taiusâa complete town
and country remitterâand a valuable repofnorv of
uCeful and intcirtting information, totally divested
of the v lolenceâ- the lliibctality - âthe iictntiouf
nefs of party.
As the Ed tor flatters himf<?lt that a rftrofpt&fve

FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.
REFLECTIONS on the STATE if the UNION
(concluded.)
The conchfion : Iking m'/cel/aveouf thoughts on the
government.
THE independency of the judiciary, as well
in the tenu e ot' their stations as in the
permanency of their compensations, under the
federal conflitution, and most of those of the
states, is an advantage over the ancient repub-
lies and the generality of modern governments,
of inestimable value in regard to liberty and
property.
The United States, being without transma
rine or dominions, are exempted from
two inconveniencies, which have resulted from
them.âAn imrnenfe naval force has been found
neceffarv to defend such territories, and protetl
the trade with them in a time of war, and the
difficulty of deviling for them a free lejiilation
has hitherto proved insurmountable. The Bri
tish nation declared, that they had a right to
lsgiflate for their colonies and dominions in
America, Asia, and Africa, in all cases whatso
ever, and the revolution of the United' States,
tn-ned Â«rÂ»on that cardinal point.
iipb.'erve that she Frtmch nation, devoted a
Sliey are to the puWuit of liberty, have not yet
been able to devise any fyitem of governmen
for their colonies without a dernier resort to
the legislature of France, it will" be a lource oJ
comfortable reflexion to the friendr, of free
and efficient government in these stateÂ«, thai
we ara not perplexed by the neceility of so de-
licate, important, and difficult an operation.
It has been unfortunate for moil nations as
well ancient as modern, that they have had 110
fettled pre-exilling mode of altering, amending,
or renovating their political Ivllem, to which
they could resort without a deviation from the
legal courle of thing' hazarding the public
tranquility, and often freedom itfelt.âlt is
equally happy tor the people of the United
States, that in their federal government, and
in most of the dates, there exists a provision,
by which those neceltary and defirableends may
be obtained, with whatever zeal without recur-
ing to irregularity or violence.
principles being already fettled by common con
sent, and duly recorded in the conltitutions, the
people cannotlongmiftake the nature of amea
fure, u law, or a poiiticÃl maxim, which is
ally opposed to them ; and when their judgment
is decided upon any one or more derelictions ot
those principles, of magnitude fufficient to in-l
dilce an effort tor reform, their will cannot bei
fuccefsfully resisted. The consequence of this
state of things will be, that the mass of error
will not easily accumulate so as to become in-
fnpportable, being kept down by thele orderl;
natural exertions of the community to relievi
themselves at an earlier stage of inconvenience
Too great a facility to change would, however

iberty itlelf: but as the mode of performinj
he amendatory or alterative operations isflow
lid consequently deliberate, light or dangerou
changes would be very difficult to accompliA)
n this view there appears to be very littl
irobability, that changes from free or repre
entative government, will take place, or the
my modification of hereditary power will isi
ntroduced into the government either ol thi
Utes or of the union. Tbe people wi]l neve

Vaufes in the feViral constitutions, which ex
ilicitly provide both in general Keriru, and ii
lirticular detail, lor.free or republican govern

ic government. Even local circumstance

hefe states. Being too remote fiom any so
â eign nation, to tender a war,. requiring a grea
trmy> at all neceifary, that iiiftrunient,fooftei
-.fed by ambitious leaders, is not likely to >
ilaced within the reach of the enemies of free
lom, while the union remains entire. It i
vorthy of the mod particular observation am
emembrance, that a dissolution of our govern
nent would immediately open a door to thi
tanger, as the several states or little confede
acies, would each deem it prudent to maintai:
i larger army than is now requisite for thi
i,hole. The liiitory of Greece will inftrufl- u
hat by this, more than by any otKer poffibl
neafure, we Ihould be prepared for the milita
y domination of lome modern Philip, or lbm<
lew Alexander. A strong union and a tranqui
iberty would be mifcrably exchanged for fuel
i {late of things,
It is an evident truth that the penal laws o
hefe states, have beenkraduaily mitigated fines
he opocha of their incKpendence ; and it is nc
el's true, that the number of crimes does not
lear so great a proportion to the population,
was formerly the cafe, though an universal
elaxation of the police took place in the late
var. It is, perhaps, an ill iymptom of the date
f things, in a society, when mild laws, ftriflly
117
executed, are incompetent to the prefervat.ion
of order ard public happiness. Our penalcodei
are. upon the whole, anjong the least
ry ; and it is believed, they are not cruel, even
in those unhappy cases, which impel com
munitv to extremities. The constitution o<
the United States has extracted all the gall
from the punifiiment of offences against the na
tional fafety, by corre?&ing the rower of lep.i'
Jating concerning them with a niildnefs un
known to the fvltems of most countries. It i
honorable to the humanity and magnanimity o
the American people, that this proceeding flow
: d from them, almo'i unanimoudy, four year*
ifter the revolution war. Future ages will dc
juitice to a nation capable oi such an effort al
i moment so particular.
Taking the United States at large, there are
ew or no countries in which at this time, the
uft demands of private creditors can be ob
ained by a more certain, a more expeditious,
>r less expensive course ot legal process.
There are some local, and a very few general
gft&s yet existing ; but they are vaniftiing be
ore the ipirit of the general and most ot the
tate constitutions. There is no part of the
mblic conduit more striking than the firmnefs
vith which they have applied the caustic to
tera e tancer.% which had b - 1 Â«
;d tc they - pecuniary lyftem, principally from
.the -"'titious causes. It proves thecxiftence ot
:hat v irtue and fortitude, which qualify a nati
â¢n ibr republican government. 1 here aie lome
â¢xceptionable circumftanres yet to be done a
vav ; but the fucceisful eiiov ts which have been

REPRESENTATIVES in COKGKtSS.
Ttte importance of ele&ing men as rep'.efen
tatives hi Congress, who are firm friends
tÂ» tbe present CoÂ»4kitntior of the United States,
has been hinted si* i" the course of these ptibli-
cations. W'her. we take a retrofpeftive view
i f the circum fiances and iituation oi the Union
at large, and of this Commonwealth in particu
lar, and compare the pre'ent state of things
with this retrofpef", it would hardly seem i ecef-
I'ary to suggest the idea to the people, that federal
men, and Jcdcral measures, have done all that
:s been doneâand that to feture and perpetu
ate -;:e bleffngs ef peace, credit and freedom, I
fedc ul men alone fliould be the object of atten
tion to I' c ficq citizen* of this State at the er
fuing ele&ion. âNo State in the Union has more
to hope or to fear than Pennsylvania, from thqfe
mea'ures of government which shall be adopted
by the thi d Congress. Her local lituation
makes her in some measure the pivot of tho e
scales in which the fate of the U: ted States is
placed. By those wife and energetic measures
of the general government, which have been
adopted, an alteration has taker place in her
circumstances so much for the better, that every
mind divested of prejudice, and the venom oi
partv, is allonifhed at its contemplation. There I
is nointereft or profeflion in the State whatever,
which has not felt the aufpicions influence of
those menfure-âmealures which were eflefted
: by the federal part of the legislature in opposition
â  to the unremitted exertion* of those of a cliifer
; ent complexionâin oppoftion to the knovn,
: because often exprefled opinions of men, who
; are at this moment held tip as tai.d dates for
â¢ the futfrages of this federal city and common
wealth.âlt is often fpecioiiflv observed, that it
is best to have'men of different fenMments in a|
legislative affembl) âthat the coliifion of opi
nions serves to produce a more jtift decilion in
the end. Bet, under this pietext, there is the
greatcft danger of introducing characters who
would rejoice in the'opportunity of lubverting
the Conitltution, and reducing thele Oates to
their late abject and deplorable condition.â
There is no danger *>f tiuih'i dying for want ot
exercise. The world is lo full of* fyftem-mon |
gers, that there is commonly as many nioder, of
doing bufmefs suggested, as there are persons

PAIII S, June 22.
THE Jacobin* are exerting every
nerve to recover their power by
inflaming the populace, but there is
no doubc government will now go oa
with order and firmnefs.
A Persian atftrefs here, of a inoft
beautiful person, is to have her head
cut off in the course of the week, for
issuing falfe afiignats. Every one la
ments her fatal destiny in the molt
pathetic manner. Her lover fufFers
with her for being an accomplice in
the bufineft.
Yellerday M. Petion waited on the
King, and drove hard to make his
majesty believe, that during the ever
memorable 20th of this month, the
constitution had not been in the least
particular violated, and thai every
iefpet r t which could be expetfted, had
been iliewn to him and the roysl fa
mily. The King anfweredy " Yoji
; have entirely infringed the conftitu-
tion so far as relates to the refpetft
due to my person. Were 1 weak
enough to cdnfefs the contrary, the
breaking open of nine different doors
to come to my apartments, by a furi
ous populace, would denionftrate that
1 had advanced a pusillanimous falfe
hood." M. Petion attempted to make
some oblervatiens, the King infilled
on his being silent. The national
guards are Hill under arms, altho'
no danger is apprehended for the
present moment. The Jacobins are
feathering fire and flames again 11 M.
de la Fayette, on account of the letter
which he had, they fay, the audacity
to write agninft their club, in which
he desired that it might be abolished.
Yesterday there was delivered to
the aliembly, the following letter
from the King :
" The National Aflembly is alrea
dy apprized of the events of yester
day. No doubt l'aris is full of con
-11 ei nation. I leave to the prudence
of the afiembly the management of
rhe conftitutiori, and alio the indivi
dual liberty of the hereditary repre
sentative of the people.
France will, with grief, learn what
has happened. /\s to me, nothing
{hall hinder me i'lom lteadily purl'u

it prescribes.

1 he King agreed, conformably to
the conftilbtion,. to i eceive a deputa
tion of 20 peril i s, and pointed out
J1 ./â¢t
h'unfelf the manner in which they
(hould be introduced. They were
topafs through thegate des Feuillans,
and go out of the gate du Menage.
These orders of the King wt re-Tent
to tlie commander in chief, who op
posed to them the orders received
from the municipality, enjoining him
to receive, under the Itaudard of tile
national guards, people ot all deno
initiations, drefled in all kinds of uni
forms, and provided wish any kind
of arms.
The pikemen in their, march had
taken the declaration of rights, which
â was carried before them. The co
lours of the Baftile, and the men of
the 14th of Jelv appeared among
them. For a banner they had an old
pair of breeches, from the mob per
haps being called here, " Sans Cu
lottes."
By three o'clock they, had defiled
through the hall of the Afl'embly, in
the rear of the palace, through the
garden, the guard having refui'ed to
oppose them, and rotind by theOuay
to the place de Carofel, in front of
the Chateau. Here they were joined
by eight pieces of cannon, and two
caid'ons ofammuriition. After half an
hourfpent in parleying, the entrance
being refufed them, they proceeded
to force. The commandant of the
guard required authority from the
Mayor and municipality to repel them,
but was refufed. The matches were
lighted, and every thing seemed to
prelude a formal battle, when the of;
ficer returned to annonncehis having
received no orders. The gates were
instantly forced, no refinance being
made, and the people in thousands
precipitated into the palace : the
doors at the entrance of the king and
queen's apartments beingclofed,with
out waiting to have them ppened,
they shattered them to pieces.
The queen retired to a second a
partnient with the dauphin in her
arms, and threw herfelf upon the
protection of a reserve of grenadiers
of the national guard. Here a third
door was broke open. The crowd
became so great, that with difficulty
the queen found a corner of the win
dow to escape from the great press.
Here, exposed to all the gross and
vile language that imagination can
conceive, (he was obliged to remain
for several hours during which they
presented her and the dauphin with
a national cockade, which she imme
diately wore.
During this scene, another of a dif
ferent nature went forward in the
king's apartment : one of the chiefs
of this mob preCented the King a red
bonnet, adorned with national cock
ades, and demanded the retraction of
the Veto which the King has placed
on the decree against the priests, and
for the establishment of a camp. His
answer was noble and manly ; " If
the welfare of the nation consists in
wearing a red cap, I have no objec
tion to wearing it. Pure in my con
science, I have no dreadâas ro the
decrees, this is no time to speak of
them !"âSome one having remarked
that he was afraid, he seized the hand
of a grenadier near him, and clap
ping it upon his heart, he Paid, " Tell
rne, my friend, does my heart beat
like a man in fear ?" He immediately
seated himfelf between the windows
of his apartment, that looked towards
the Thuilleries, and put on a red cap.
One of the mob offered him a glass
to drink the health of the nation ; he
accepted it, and drank it without
seeming to have the finalleft appre
henGon.
The crowd began to press upon
liim. A national guard was nearlv
forced out of his place, near his ma
jelly. " The King," cries this brave
fellow, '( is our fafeguard, I would
not desert him, for a hundred thou
sand crowns !" A municipal officer
attempted to speak, but could not be
heard. Several members made the
fame attempt without success.
M. Santerre then tried what he
could do ; a roar ensued, of " Long
live Petion ! Long live the good, the
worthy Petion !" The gootf, the wor
thy Petion then addressed the King.
" The people (fays he) have appear
ed with dignity, and with dignity
they will depart. \'our majesty mav
niake yourfelf easy." Santerre or
dered the deputation to come for
â ward.
The fpokefnian according!* de
manded chat t'lie patriotic iiiiiiifters
be re inflatedâthat the Veto be re
rraifted relative to the two obnoxious
decrees
The King anfweved :
" i have fwoni to maintain the
conHiturion, and J will defend it at
the risk of my life."
Clamours were renewed of" Long
live the nation ! Long live Sans Cu
loi:ts ! Long live liberty ! No Veto !
The eyes of the leaders of the mob,
and of many of the mob themselves,
glistened with rage. " Long live
Santei re* !" A grenadier attempted
to quiet them, the Prince told Jlim,
" Let them aloue, my friend ; let
their words be ever so injurious, it is
all the fame to me."
By this time several deputies, alarm
ed at the (late of the Royal .Family,
had aflembled, and a deputation of
24 members was named to surround
the person of the King, and to be re
placed every half hour by a frelh de
putation, so as to inform the afiembly
of the Hate of his majesty. M. Pe
tion arrived about the lame time with
the deputation. The people Itill con
tinue their clamours, for the restora
tion of the late ininiftry, and the sanc
tion of the decrees ; but in vain ; the
King retained the fame manly firm
nefs and conversed with the deputa
tion without the smallest appearance
of inquietude. By persuasions and
intrearies, the mayor and four of the
deputies prevailed upon the people to
withdraw. They had palled all over
the palace, the roofs were covered
with the multitude, they hungin duf
fers to the windows ; and except the
breaking of some doors and windows,
no other mifchief was done, no acci
dent even ensued.
Towards night fall tlie Palace was
entirely cleared, the deputies, had
previously profited of an interval in
the affluence of tlie crowd, and con
/fueled the King to his bed chamber.
Towards ten o'clock all was qniet ;
the citizens all retired peaceably to
their respective homes and the night
was pafl'ed in the utmofi tranquility.

LETTER FROM M.LA FAYETTE TO TtfZKiXG
"sire,
" I have the honor to fend

humanity, equality, and justice. He
knows that I was always the adver

thought unlawful, was ever acknow

PROCLAMATION OF THE KING.
" fr renchmen cannot hear without
concern, thata multitude, cxcited by
fomefactious persons, came with arms
in their hands into the King's palace,
drawing a piece of cannon even into
the guard-room ; that they broke
open the doors of his apartment with
axes, and there audaciously abusing,
by afluming the name of the nation,
attempted to obtain by force the sanc
tion which his Majelty had conftiiu
tionally refufed tp two decrees.
" T he King opposed to the mena
ces and insults of these factious per
sons only his conscience and his love
for the public weal.
" The King does not know at what
point they would flop; but he thinks
it right to inform the French nation,
that violence, to whaterer excess it
may be carried, shall never tear from
him his consent to whatever he fliall
think contrary to the public interest.
He exposes, without regret, his own
peace, and his personal fafety ; he
gives up even without pain, the en
joyment of the rights which belong
to all men, atid which the law ought
to refpetfi in him as well as in all ci
tizens ; but, as the hereditary repre
sentative of the French nation, he has
severe duties to fulfil, a âd thousli he
will make the facrifice of his own re
pose, he will not facrifice his duties
! If those who wi(h to overthrow
the monarchy have need of one crime
more, they may commit it. In the
crilis in which he finds himfelf, the
King will, to the lad moment, give
co all the conftituied powers, the ex
ample of that courage and firmnefs
which can alone sav e the empire. In

LONDON, July 2,
The paragraphs lately inlerted in
several papers have had the effec't to
be nnfappr eh ended perhaps intend
ed by the authors of thein.
Yesterday morning Lord Lauder
dale, attended by the right, hon. C
J. Fox as his second, and Cenerai
Arnold with Lord Hauke, as his
si lend, had a meeting in a field near
Kilburn-Well, to terminate a miOin
derltand.ng which it was found i m .
poliible to conciliate.
J he principals, with their seconds
and lurgeons.arriv'd upon theg-ound
about 7 o'clock, occupying a p o st.
coach and two poft-cbaifes. Having
taken their stations, Lord Lauder
dale refuted to toss up for the firft
site, or to fire at the fame time with
Gen. Arnold. As the General iho't
himfelf injured, his Lordlhip infilled
upon receiving the firft fire.
Gen. Arnold fired, happily with
out efFetfl, on which Lord Lauder
dale declared, that he could now with
honor acknowledge, that he might
have been mistaken in his flriftures
concerning Gen. Arnold ; and that
i herefore he should not fire on a gei,-
rleinan whom he was inclined tocou
fider as the offended man.
This liandfome apology immedi
ately fettled the unhappy difference,
which has arisen originally from the
following part of Lord Lauderdale's
speech in the House of Lords.
" If apoftacy is a recommendation
to command, the Duke of Richmond,
of all officers, is the best entitled to
that of the camp of Bagfhot, prodd
ed the name of Gen. Arnold beftruck
off the lilt."
July 3. Lord Cornwallis and his
brother will return from India as
soon as the biifinefs of the war is
wound up, which, from the accuracy
pratftifed in every department, will
soon be done.
General Meadows,alas ! isnomore
âdeprefled by the mistake which he
fell into in the atftion, he took the
desperate resolution of committing
suicideâhe died it is said by a pistol
ball. His worth and his honorable
services in the field, entitle liim to
the regret and lasting esteem of his
country.
M. la Fayette is now beginning to
ail like a man and a soldier. When
his sovereign's life is in danger,from
a democratic rabble, he eagerly fiic>
to preserve him. His army only watt
his commands for the famepurpofe.
July 7. Many who are acquainted
with the extensive and valuable po'"
feflions ofTippoo,in theÃednore coun
try, and which are now to be aaa'
to the English pofleflions in the E' l >
positively alfert, that their revenues
produce aa income of joo.oocl. per
ann.âan acquisitionâalone fufficient
to (hew the vast importance oi 1 e
peace made by Lord Cornwall'''
Such has been the progrefli ( e 3
of the revenue during the P r * en ,
year, that the excess, it is Â«P eUei >
will amount to 800,0001. abo*e t 1
former one. Such is the c*> eCt 0

Before M. Pitt came into office, 011
eighth of the revenue went tÂ° en
rich individuals, or elfeit was ne*
collected.The aJdrelTei from every part of
ilie kingdom are as general as they
were on the King's recovery. This
/hews the difpoluion of the people to
fupporc the conftirution and govern
ment of the country againlt those
who would wifli to undermine ic un
der the specious word of reform.
The proclamation has done more to
feeure the tranquility of the kingdom
than any uieafure Mr. Pitt could have
advised.
The Sierra Leona Company have

The country had been surveyed,
and was found in general well Suited
for the produce of coffee and cotton,
and fonie parts for sugar ; and there
is every reason to hope and believe,
from the account received, that the
Settlement will answer the end pro

Municipal Body, the Council Gene

A mausoleum has been ereifled, de
corated with the emblems of war and
of public grief, upon which infcrip
lions express the hiltory of his life,

Such is one part of the honors paid

The following law cafe was tried
before Lord Kenyon on Monday last :
âThis was an action brought by La
dy Elizabeth Lamben, against -the
Defendant, Mr. Tatterfall, who was
a dealer in horses, and also a propri
etor of the morning Port, for a gross
and fcandaious libel contained in dif
ferent paragraphs of that paper, and
charging her with unchaftity, by
eloping with her footman.
This young lady was unmarried,
and was only about nineteen yeais
of age.
She was with her mother at South
ampton at the time these fcandaious
paragraphs were publiflied, and a
yotig lady poffelfing the highest ad
complifliments. .
After Lord Kenyon had addrefled
the Jury, they retired about an hour,
and returned with a verdiift for the
PlaintiffââFour Thousand Pounds

A new incident in the forgery of a will has
lately occurred, which would hare done honour
to the brilliant invention of a Barringtonâthe
trick of putting and guiding a pen in the dead
man's hand, was not fufficient to fatisfv the

absolutely to swear, that when the will was wit
re.Ted, they saw life in himâand a live fly was
actually put into the mouth of the corpse in
order that they miight fafely swear to the fact.

Paris is now quite quiet. Quiet it would be
for ever, were it not for the wars of foreign
despots; those thieves and car cafe butchers on
the borders ! the-ne w conilitution of the French
is, and all created nature may Wei's Gbd for it,
altogether pacific. It would fruitrate all war
abroad, as /t has already fruftrated all law liti
gations at home. Mr. Burke indeed said, 44 the
constitution was litigious." liut he will fay so
no more. For it is not true. Out of 8000
causes, before the tribunals at Paris, above
6yoo are fettled, if not amicably, at least equi
tably and unexpenfively, by the enacted preli
minary arbitration. (Bureau de Conciliation.)â
And as to the exifling war with the animal the
King of Hungary, as he is called, he, if any such
lie tiling there be, who (hall impute it to the
French, will be just as wife and as credited,
as the fufpe&ed Irilhman was, who vapoured
about a breach of the peace, when Lord iSerke-

It is worthy remark, that whilftthe Govern

tiie celebrated Mr. Paine, Mr. Fox, and many
other friends to the Rights tf Man, in the French
and BritiTi Legislatures; they are i'ubjafts of
daily abu'e to anonymous scribblers, and fac
tious partizins, in the United States. It would
seem that the advocates of tyranny, had bribed
a set of miscreants in Franie and America, to
vilify the only legitimate Reprefeotative Go
vernments in the world ! But the charge is
certainly an imputation Vn their judgment, in

N EW-YORK, September 7.
Yesterday pafl'ed through this city, on their
way to Fort-Pitt, a company of about 70 men,
commanded by Capt. Eaton, and railed by the
state of Vermont.
However trifling the acquisition of this state
might have been considered by some previous to
her union with the United States, we have now
a just right to esteem her a valuable member;
for, since that period, we do not find that (he has
been remiss even in punttillios, and to her cre
dit it may be said, at this time, flie has produced
a set of men, perhaps unequalled by any of her
fitter states. They, from appcarance, are all
under thirty; and one would imagine that an
army compofsd entirely of such men, would
itrike terror in the hearts of the most blood
thirsty of the aborigines of America, however
fuccefsful they might have been in former cam
paigns.

aid they regarded no bounds, and equally vio
ated law and truthâthey were alike destitute

lenonnced those journals, which were writter

hemfelves every day in writing hbels agamii

The papers on the continent talk of negoci
ttions relpeifting French affairs âthat couriers
aid meifengers arc daily palling from one Court
o another, dtc.
The French accounts mention frequent de
ertions from the Auftriansâthe latter balance
;iefe accounts by faying great delertions are
laily taking place from the French army.
We hear that the insurgent negroes at Hifpa
niola, have lately defeated a body oi French]
troops, under the command of M.Bianchelande;
several valuable French officers 101 l their iives,
it is asserted, on this occasion.
In the Missouri, from Bourdeaux, came pas
sengersâMr. Franklin Wharton, Mr. John
Allen, and Mr. Brian. \
The lhip Conne&icut, Cr.pt. Phipps, hasbro't
330 passengers from Londonderryâthe Alexan

Capt. Magee, from Newry, 200âall in good
health.
Xn the Britannia, Martin, arrived at New- ;
York on Sunday lalt, from Glasgow, came 57
passengers.
Capt. Martin had 37 days passage, and has
brought Glasgow newlpapers to the ift August.
Mr. John Mason, foil of the late Rev. Doctor
Mason, of N.York, arrived in tie above Ihip.
French accounts by the above are subsequent
to those already publilhed, viz.
July 19. This day we have the counter lift
of a Ministry designed by the Jacobins; that is
M. Servan, M. Roland, artd M. Claviere, to
come back to office and to be joined by M. Mag
nier, M. Grouvelle, and M. Louvet. This is,
however, denied by themselves and their friends
in a very obstinate way j and the truth is, that
the convulsion remains unabated. This will,
perhaps, determine it-j far the question of M.
La Fayette copies on in the afiembly, and I
have no doubt but the Jacobins will carry tome
resolutions, in which cafe a Jacobin Ministry
will be appointed, and this will indnce the di
rectory of the Department, as well as M. La
Fayette, and many others, to resign. There
is no profpeft of a middle course, and what this
arrangement is likely to produce I dread to
tonje&ure.

In Mr. Phllip Freneau's National Gazette,

impeached the impartiality of the Editor of

publiflied the Letters! ! 1
The substance of thole Letters is however
contained in the address to the Gerinantown

with the candid to determine âThe impartiality
which from the beginning has lb fuper-eminent

I fail of meeting a proper reward.
COMMUNICATIONS.
The men who impute all manner of folly and
corruption to the servants of the people, who
I tell us how much they hate the vites of a court
I and how heartily they despise the tools of office,
seem to think that their own purity bears pro
portion to the turpitude and foulnefs of the
I characters they draw. In private life, it is
thought proper to exercise a little charity in fa
vor even of the worst men : but if we Jfhould
hunt for the faults of our neighbors, and, as
soon as we have found a pin hole in their fame,
we Ihould go to work to enlarge itâif we should
catch every wind of suspicion that blows over
them, and call it proof, what would be said of
our conduct ? We should be deemed pests in lo
ciety. Yet there are writers who pursue this
method in regard to government, and who pre
tend to great merit for doing so.
<i A house divided against itfelf cannot stand."
When one servant of the public intrigues and
makes parties against the proceedings of ano
ther, there will be a want of order in the ad
ministration, and the highest degree of inlectiri
ty against the attacks of those who would tear
the government down to the very foundation
stones. Yet the party writers reprelent thole
who hold the offices of government, as combin
ed in a plot against the people. The cafe there
fore stands thusâif they happen not to be well
agreed, their measures, engendered in discord,
will come to nothingâand if they be well a
greed, it is a proof of a confpii acy against li
berty.
If it were the business 6f the political sphere
to keep forever revolving, as our globe does,
we have men among us who might deserve the
name of very clever, because they do all they
can to hinder its still. But when the
people ri(k life and property for the fake of the
inestimable privilege of framing a free govern
ment for themselves and their posterity, their
toils and dangers are relieved by the hope that
they (hall finally prevail and live in peace and
security. No sooner have they gained their
objedt, than men who abhor a state of tranqui
lity, and who expe<ft to get power and office by
disturbing it, tell them that their own laws are
despotic, and their fubmiflion to their own go
vernment is owing to the decline of their for
mer high spirit of liberty. If we are to fight to
set up a government, and thÂ«n to fight to over
turn it, we may have to fight for a time in a
state of anarchy, till a defpotilm shall be eftab
liflied to keep the peace. Those unquiet parti
zans who try to keep the world in a bustle, may
poflibly have the love of liberty in their hearts,
but they will not lend much alliitance to the
work qJT ere&ing her temple.
