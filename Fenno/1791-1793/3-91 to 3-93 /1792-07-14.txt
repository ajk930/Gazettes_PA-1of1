FXOU THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.
REFLECTIONS on the STATE of tit UNION.
(continued.)
Concerning the Imports cj the United States
THIS part of the national bufincfs has given
nfe to doubts, whether the United States are
really in d prosperous lituation. The apprrhen
lion is believed, however, to have proceed* d from
levcral errors. The efhmation of the imports,
lias probably been made at the prices current in
America, which is more than the United States
pay for them, by the total value of the following
particulars. i,Such pait of the Ihipping chaigcs Â«t
---broad a* accrue to the benefit of r ihe citizens of the
United States,who may be on the fpotto make the
ftiipments ; 2. That part of the freight upon
them which is paid upon our own vessels; 3, That
part of the premium of mfurance upon them,
which is paid to American underwriters or iu
furers ; 4, The whole amount of the duties of the
custom houle fees, 011 the goods, amount
to several million of dollars ; 5. The amount of
the tonnage and fees on foreign veiicls, which are
dedu&ions in favor of the country, from the va
lue of the goods imported in them ; 6. The por
terage, llorage, cooperage, weighing, guagmg,
niealuring, commiilions on falcs here, and other
incidental expenUs 011 that part or the imports
which belongs to foreigners; 7. The profits ol
our merchants on that part of tne imports which
belongs to them ; 8, The wafteage of goods be
longing to foreigners between then arrival or time
of valuation and the time of laic; g, The benefit
of credit which is not less than two and an haif
per cent, on the whole v<nue of our lmoorts ; dnd
10, The value of those imported goods which re
mdin in the country, being the proverty of perrons
intending to become, or who will ultimately be
come citizens of the United States, iiut the ap
parent or conjectural difproportiori between the,
exports and imports of the United States, will bt
considerably duninifhed by the falcs of vessels to'
foreigners at home and abroadâthe faies or lands
to themâthe expenses of foreigners hereâthe
expenies of foreigh vessels, and the coll of their
lea Itoiesâtheir commiilions on Hie fhipinent oi
their cargocs, and 011 the dilburlemrnt of tht\i
vessels, as already obierved in treating of our ex
perts. Beliaes tneic, the freight of goods to fo
reign countries in our vessels (not less, probably,
than three millions of dollais) and the proliu
upon all the goods exported on the account of our
own citizens, contribute very much to encrealc
the fund, wherewith our unpoiu arc purchaled
and paid for. An ellunate, which fiiall com
prehend all the-fe items at their true value, is ne
cessary to form a fatislÂ»&ory opinion of the ba
lance on our trace. From fucfi an estimation
(which has been made) there would relult no ica
fon to doubt our proiperity; nor will this appcai
queltionable, when it is remembered, that the
outward freights on our own vessels and the
duties on goods imported, - amount together to
6.400,000 dollars, which is mote than one tbird
of our expoits. The balance of trade has been
aptly denominated the metaphvfics of commerce.
To determine it with mdilputable certainty re
quires as accurate and elaborate an invelligation
as a metaphyseal qucifion : and though this as
sertion proves nothing, it will lufpiie us with due
caution againlt haftiiy adopting unfavorable con-
clufions.
An opinion so me what lingular and of consider
able impoilance will be hazarded upon tins fub
jedh The United Siates, to make the utinoil ad
vantage of things in their present improveabJe
lituation, should have little or no balancc m their
favor ou their genera) commcrce. It their ex
poits, outward heights, laics of vciFels and lands,
&c. amount to twenty-four million of dollars
pei annum, they will find their true interest in
importing the whole value in well felefted com
modities. It is better, for example, that they
import molaflVs, hemp, cotton, wool, bar-iron,
hides, skins, furs, la'tpetre, sulphur, copper, tin,
brass, paper, mahogany, &c. to roanufaÂ£lure ;
tools for artizans, and materials and utcnfils for
conftrufting works, improving wade lands and
cultivating farms, and breeding cattle, horses and
sheep, than that they (hould bring back the equi
valent in gold or silver.
The sum we annually import in articles of that
nature, more precions to us than the moll precious
metals, would conffitute an imm nfe balance in
our favor ; such, indeed, as would in a few years
oppress out country with too copious a cuculating
medium, or compel us to export it.
That the exports and other means of paying
for our imports are much more adequate to the
occasion, than they were during several years fub
lequent to the peace, is manilcft from the Hate of
our private credit in Europe.
A diilin&ion, and it is conceived, a very im
portant one, has been already intimated in favor
of such of our imports as are of a nature adapted
to enhance the value of our lands, or to employ
or aliift our citizens : and in regard to those
which are for immediate consumption, the quan
tity cannot be in proportion to our lormer im
ports considering the increase of population.â
We have almost absolutely cealed to import shoes,
boots, fadlery, coarse hats, piate, fnuff, manu
factured tobacco, cabinet wares, carriages, wool
and cotton cards, hanging paper, gun powder
and other articles ; and we have exceedingly di
minished our importation of coatfe linnen and
woolen goods, cordage, copper utensils, tin uten
sils, malt liquots, loaf sugar, ite 1, paper, playing
cards, glue, wafers, fine hats, biazicry, watches
and clocks, cheese, &c. and we euher makethefe
articles from native proouttions, by which the
whole \alue is (buck off fiom our imports, or we
r <4 A ( -C
[Whole No. 555.]
manufacture them from foreign raw inaicrul?,
which coil leis than the goods uled io do, efpccialiy
as they often yield a great freight iu our own vei-
IcU. Thus the height of molafTes to make run ,
imported in one yeai, at two dollais per hhd. was
not leis than 140.000 dollars. The fame oblerva
tioa occuts as to hemp, cotton, iron, copper, brafd,
tin, fait petre, lulphur, inahogany, hides, dye
woods, and other iaw materials.
From these circumftanrial evidences, there
would appear to be little danger of miltake, in
concluding, that our imports, in a medium c,f
two or three years, have not been difproponion
<'te to our exports, and other I'afe and regular
means of balancing the amount of our iuppUcs.
But though the documents for acomparifon be
tween the present imports and those antecedent
to the revolution, are less perfect than is to be
delired, some which offer are worthy of atten
tion. Our imports from Great-Britain in
making some addition lor those from Ireland*
and adding twenty per cent, to bring them to
their market value, were worth here above
2,400,0001. llerling. In this item, the;informa
tion obtained from a report of the Lords of the
British pnvy council is principally relied on though
a part of it is fupplementlry information. To
(Ins sum is to be added, a proportion of the im
ports into .all the American colonies in 17-0,
f;om all the reft of the world but Great-Britain]
whleft, after dedutting therefiom 23,000!. fieri,
for the vaiue imported into Bermuda, the north
ern British colonies, and Newfoundland, leaves
1,0.50,0001. at the vaiue here. The total value
of our imports in 1770, would then appear to have
been more than 3 , 45Â°3Â° t>0 Â» 01 about 15,000,000
dollars as thev would have fold in the American
market, exclufivc of tfie contraband tiade which
was coniiderable. This will be'ieen by a refer
ence to the liifl number of these reflexions, to be
full seven millions inoie than our exports at the
fame time, if then our imports were to bear the
fame proportion to 18,250,000 dollars (our present
exports)'the former might be above 24,000,000
dollars, without creating more alarm than we had
then leafon to feel, 'i his view of the iubjetl may
convince us, that our imports were too copious,
at leait m some quarters, for several years before
rue war ; and hence we find a heavy load of pri
vate debt was created and remains upon some of
the citizen* of the United States at this day. Hap
pily for the United Slates, the reduction of the
prices of iupplies, by the present freedom of their
commerce, by the agency of fkilful merchants, in
itead of planters inexperienced intrude, by the in
trodu&ion of machinery in Europe, and by their
own manufacturing industry, has kept down their
imports many millions of dollars below that sum,
although the impoftand tonnage have diredtly or
.indirectly contributed to enhance the nominal a
mount without incicdfuig the sum to be paid lor
,â¢ them abroad.
A Sketch of the general Trade of the United States.
IN taking a iurvey ot the American commerce*
the attention is att rafted to the.increase
of (hip building, the new manufactoriesof articles
necefTary to the equipment ol veflels, and the im
provement in the aitof ship building, as well as
the superior quality of the materials now used in
their conltruttion. The largest number of veflels
built in any one year before the late war, as far as
it can be ascertained, was equal to 24,358 !on>,
and at lealt 32,000 tons of superior quality were
built in 1791. The timber and plank, are more
cholen, nnd iron is more copiously used at this timt\
becaule the vcifels are not intended for fafe-, and
the fenlible practice of falling them is bccom
very frequent. It is important, too, that the art
ot thip building is diffufed more generally than
â¢any other equally important one which is carried
on within the United States.
The export trade in our produce is more bene
ficial than heretofore to the landed inteitft, be
caule ihe cultivatois Go not, as formerly, antici
pate upon their oops abroad, by ordering out
lupplies at the difcrction ot the European mer
chant, to be paid for in shipments of their crops
on their own account and risque. The planters
in Maryland md Virginia, particularly the tobac
co planters, iuflered extreme ly by an inconfider
purfuit of that practice before the revolution.
1 he American merchant is noW more frequently
their importer; and as he underitands the mode
of procuring goods cheap, the re<ii piofiis of the
import and export tiade of the country, are in a
greater degree divided between the planter and
the trader.
Ihe redu&ion of the prices of East-India and.
China goods, ot every ipeciej ot manufactures in
which labor-saving machinery and flight apply,
and ot wines, occaiion our imports to be obtained
on moie favorable terms. This beneficial ef
fect is increased by the freedom ot our import
trade, which lets in the produ&ions and manu
factures ot all countries by a direÂ£t intercourse
with them, which was formerly forbidden. From
the fame caule, superior prices tor our produce
and manufactured articles have been obtained.
If tobaceb is becoming an exception, it is to be
remembered, that great prices were obtained for
it till lately, and that the txiraoidinary quantity
raited is tufheient to account for its tall.

A LETTER was written by rlie
Kiiig on Friday night, addrefled
to Lord Thorlow, Lord High Chan
cellor of England, declaring th it he
had no further oecafion fur his fervi
c es
Ic wasrenjaikaWe, that Lord Tnur
low prefixed as usual in his place in
the Court of Chancery on Saturday ;
and it is to bs wilhed that a reconci
liation may tike place between the
jarring parties.
Mr. Pitt having confulered the con
duct of the Lord Chancellor on the
national income and expenditure bill,
not only as a direc't and decided
mark of hostility to his uiinifterial
measures, bur heaving also felt the
language made use of on the occasion
as a perfonaj affront to himfelf, he
formed a resolution of resigning his
situation, if Lord Thurlow was per
mitted to hold the Chancery Seals.
To develope the causes of the rup
ture between Lord Thurlow and Mr.
Pitt, which has the re
moval of the former from the Kino's
Councils, would be 110 easy talk. Their
differences are of long (landing, and
have become inveterate by indul
gence. They began on the qneftion
of Mr, Hastings* trial in 1786, and
hardly one measure hasocctired since
that time, upon which they have cor
dially agreed. Strong and niniual
attachment betwen his Majesty and
the noble Lord, re'ained him in office
againlt the wilhes of Mr. Pitt ; and it
is a fair, that now he is difuiiifed
through the holtility of a certain
diftinguilhed person, whose occalion
al interference in political intrigue
is at length matter of record.
None of his friends retire with
him. The Marquis of Stafford conti
nues in place,and the noble and learn
ed Lord has the fatisfadlion of know
ing that he carries his Majesty's ap
probation into private life,from which
it is not improbable but he may f'oon
be recalled.
His dismission was direct. He re
ceived a letter from Mr. Dmulas, in
timating the King's pleasure, that he
would be ready, in a few days, to ac
cept the offer which he had made, of
resigning the seals. He keeps then,
till to morrow, against which time a
cominiflion will be ready for putting
them into the hands of three judges,
who are {aid to be Chief Baron Eyre, I
Mr. Justice Buller, and Mr. luttice
Wilson.
Letters from the East-Indies were
received from Lord Cornwallis, by
the Queen, and Minerva ships, dated
the 20th January 1792, by which we
learn that the strong Hill fort ofNun
dy Durgum was carried by alfault 011
the 24th of October last ; a poll of
infinite consequence, as it secures ex
tensive communications behind the
army : the firft Killaderand Buklhey
were taken prisoners, and the second
Killader and a few of the garrison
were killed, but the greatest "part of
them escaped by scrambling down
the rocks on the back of the fort.
Major Cowdie has also reduced the
fort of Rymunghers ;-and General
Meadows took by storm on the night
of the 17th Oc'iober, the amazfng
strong fort of Nundy Droog ; it con
lilted of about 700 men, the mnior
part of whom escaped down the rock ;
but the Ift and 2d Killedars and the
Bukfliey we.e made prisoners. Se
vevndroog, a fortrefs hicherto deem
ed impregnable has likewise been
carried by alfault. Lord Cornwallis
is expected to reach Seringapatam by
the 25th January, f 0 that accounts of
the capture of that place may be look
ed for (hortly.
Information is said to be received
by the I landers mail, that La Fayette
is gone wâh his army of 50,000 men
to besiege Namur.
Report states, that M. Rochambeau
after the repulse of M. Biron, imme
diately marched with his force to re
new the attack of Mons, and ic was
expetfied that he must succeed.
On the 4th ulr. the f.omte de Kellar
remitter of Pruflia to the United Ne
therlands, delivered a memorial, to
which a categorical answer was de
manded, whether their High Mighti
ness would or would not Itill retain
in their pay and service the troops
ol Anfpach ; and that his Royal Mas
ter would, in the latter cafe, cause
thein to be removed from the territo
ries of Holland.
In reply to this memorial, on the
24th ult. their High Might inefles,with
â  lie concurrence of the Prince Stadt
holder, resolved to retain one year
longer in their pay and service, not
only the troops of Anfpach, but also
ihofe of Brunlwick and Mecklenburg.
The provinces of Guelder, Utrecht,
Ki iezeland.Qveryfleljand Groningen,
have already given an affirmative to
this Hep ; and their High Mightinefl
es have ordered a requisition to be
aiade to the provinces of Holland and
Weft Friefland, who have hitherto
only consented to the retaining of
the troops of firunfwick.
The Polish Church is laid to have
given the greatest proof of patriotifui
which an tcclefiaftical establishment
could possibly give, by faciificing its
revenues to the service of the state,
and reserving only a living for its
own clergy.
The mines of Mexico, in pofleffion
of Spain, have produced more during
ths la(t year,'than in any one since
they were fir It discovered. The

you, behold an army, in cool blood
and without a shadow of teafon, at
tempting to hang their General in
the centre of the camp, who owes
his life to the grenadier company of
the regiment of Armagnac.

ROCHAMBEAU'S ARMY.
From Valencieunes, May 11.
M. le Marechal de Rorhainbeau is
informed, only through the medium
of the public prints, that his resigna
tion has been accepted by the King,
and that M. Marechal Luckner is to
fm;ceed him. No official dispatch has
yet reached him on this head, fothat
his whole army, who love him, and
whose confidence he perfectly com
mands, are in a (tate of anxious ex
pectation. It cannot be said that the
general partakes of this anxiety ; his
care and activity, though on the eve
of retiring, are,if any thing,encreaf
ed. His fuccell'or cannoL proceed
more wiiely, prudently and vigorous
ly. Yet the enemy informed of our
divisions, of the affronts the General
has met with, and of the discontent
(hewn by part of the troops, appear
disposed to bear hard on the northern
army. A body of jy or 18,000 men
[is collected on this fide of- Mons. Ge
neral Bender and Prince Saxe-Tef
chen are to command it. They now
and then venture to make trifling in
cursions into our territory ; but the
cordon of our troops has conltantly
driven them back, with loss 011 their
fide.
M. de Noailles commands this cor
don, which is composed of three re
giments of Chafleurs, on horseback,
one of huzars ot Ellerhazy, and of a
lew companies of grenadiers of the
line and national troops. They are
perfectly well disciplined, (hew the
greatest zeal and incredible atftivity.
1 he remainder of the troops are anx
ious to retrieve their character.
RIOTS AT BIRMINGHAM
! May 20. Some weeks ago, a private
of the regiment of Blues went to a
house of ill-fame in this town, when
on some dispute, one Busby (truck
the soldier so violent a blow on the
head with a glass bottle, that being
moved to Coventry, after a few days
he died. A Coroner's inquell was
taken ; and in consequence of the
verdidl, the Coroner's warrant came
here, and Sulby and others prelent
at the conflict were committed to
gaol. The populace were determin
ed to take vengeance on every house
of a like description in the town.
1 his is the origin of the riots at
Birmingham, which rose to such a
height as to produce the interposition
of the military, but not till a number
of houses were gutted of their con
tens.

Repulse of the trench jrow Tournay.
The ininifcer at war gave the sol-

A detachinenc from thegarrifon of
Lille, inarched on the ISth ot April
in the evening to attack Tournay.
This detachment met the enemy at
about three leagues distance from
the city, and the following is the
melancholy issue of the combat, ac
cording to the account given of it in
'he letter of M. Chaumont, adjutant
general to M. Rochambeau.

was that he differed the
army on the he'ghts, in
4,cons position, and appearing to be much more
tonfiderable than he had realon to expert.
From these circumstances he infeired that
the enemy had been fufficiently apprized ot his
def.*n, to enable them to prepare for defence.
He however passed the night in fight of the ene
my, having taken care in the evening to ac
quaint Marlhal Rochambeau of his htuatton
His army Teemed to be in the belt poflible dis
position, when all of a sudden he was intprmed
that a part of the Queen's regiment was re
treating. He flew after them alone, and iuc
ceeded in bringing them back, but found the
army on his return in the greatest alarm and
agitation. The fugitives had given out, on
commencing their retreat, that the genera! was
cone over to the enemy. Ihe diiorder which I
this falfe report had spread generally through
the army, did not escape the notice of the Aul
trian troops ; they attacked ; and although M.
Biron could not reltore order entirely, he con
duced his retreat with so much judgment and
firmnefs, that although pursued for more than
ur leagues, it was impoflible for the enemy
to cut him oft. .
He then resolved to gain the position whicn
he occupied in the evening above guievrain.
The post was already occupied by the Auftrians
âwith a single battalion he diilodged the Hul
lans, and took possession of it : but a reinforce
ment was neceilary to maintain it. He ran
himfelf to bring up a feeond battalion and two
piece? of cannot; but either owing to mistake
occasioned by clouds ot dust, which made some
bodies of our troops fire on each other, while
parties of Hullans were keeping up a warm dii
charge upon them ; or to the reft of the army
colle&ed in the woods to takebreath, being ex-
haufted by hunger and fatigue, he found it im
poflible to effect his purpole.
All our troops then fell back to Valenciennes.
Our loss cannot yet be ascertained. It is
however probable that the loss ot the enemy is
more conliderable than ours.
The second battalion of national volunteers
of Paris and the hufTars of did parti-
cular execution among the Huljans. Fhefe
two corps by their ardour, their lirmnefs, their
courage, and above all by their discipline, gave
an example, that if followed by the reft ot tne
troops, especially the sth and 6th regiments of
dragoons, would have insured the success of the
expedition.
The greater part of the baggage and artil-
lery was saved.
Marshal Rochambeau, to cover their entrance
into the town, advanced with three regiments
up the heights of the hill and under the guns
of the place. At eight in the evening he was
fired on by some detached parties of Auftrians
that were fcowering the plain.
M. Biron was the last man of his army that
entered Valenciennes. He immediately re
paired to the mpuicipaiity to aflure them that the
town was in no danger. He received testimo
nies of esteem and afte&ion both from the citi
zens and the soldiers.
The Leyden Gazette states, that an engage
ment took place between tie French and the
Adftrians towards Furnes, from which the lat
ter, after the loss of a tew men, retreated, but
it does not appear whether the account refers
to either of the defeats above mentioned, or to
a third of the detachment of 1200 men, expected
to march agalnft Furnes under JVI. (.arl.
TheMinifteratWar has renewed his demand
that the AlTembly ftiould make the mod efie&u
al provision for the maintenance oi order. He
said, that when it was determined to make
war, it was resolved in council to penetrate in
to Brabant.
1. That the war might be withdrawn from
a frontier but leagues trom Paris.
2. To prevent the aflfembling of the force of
the enemy, and to aift before they had made
their plans of operation, fixed t'eir magazines,
and taken their ground.
3. To second the ardour of the troops who
were eager to make their attack.
4. To profit from the dispositions of the peo
ple of Brabant, who according to report were
anxious to iecond us ; and to chafe from the
frontiers the troops that had forced us to arm.
This was chiefly the ground upon which the
ministers determined unanimously to make the
attack. Though the troops indeed wanted ma- ,
ny Ox their stores, it was not thought right to;
retard them in their march ; and it was thought
at the fame time, that Â£he want of discipline,
so necessary to regular a&ion, was not an ob
stacle that ought to Hop their motions, a<-, it it
were true that the country y/as dilfatished, dis
cipline was not necelfary to their success. The
fame argument applied to the want of know
ledge of the troops, and to want of experience
in some of the generals, as a regular war was
not the, object. The movements of the army
of M. Luckner were to be merely defenfive,
because that frontier is opposite to States with
whom we are not at war. The army of M. la
Fayette was to be detached towards Givet,
and the General himfelf to attack Namur, in
concert with M. de R.ochambeau. M. Dillon,
in whose detachment there appeared the fame
disorder as in that of M. de Biron, and ol which
he became the unhappy victim, was ordered
only to make a falfe attack uport Tournay. j
He"ought not to have had infantry, and his in
ftru<stions were not to risk an engagement. He
has apparently been forced to depart from his
orders, in taking battalions who did not know
the danger of their inconsiderate zeal, or who,
perhaps were excited by traitors* seduced by
the enemy, to cry out treason, and to put the
army into disorder.

Jay at Mandevill's tavern, from whence he
was attended by a large concourse of citizens
on horseback and in carriages to ttfsvn. On his
entering the city he was saluted by a discharge
of artillery, the ringing of the bells, and the uni
versal inclinations of the citizens, who con

has blown up in Marseilles, containing a consi
derable quantity of ammunition and military
stores âa body of national artillery on guard,
near the spot, almost all pei'ifliedâwhat occa
sioned this accident is not known. An article
under the Paris head of April 30, fays, the Au
ltrun soldiers are deserting the colours of patri
otilin, and that a company of grenadiers have
come over to the northern army. M. Biron
in his letter to the Minister of war, fays, " I
| ought to tell you, that I found the country en
tirely declared against us; not one patriot gave
us intelligence, not one joined us, not one de
serter came in." M. Rochambeau in his letter
to the King imputes the misfortunes of the ar
my tp the contrary counsels, and inftru&ions
of the French minittry ; the campaign he fays
111 consequence of these positive in.lirm'tions
was brought on fifteen days sooner than was at
firft intended ; be fays his representations to
the miniftsrs have not been attended to for one
moment, nor the information he gave on the
fubjeift of not feeing-any disposition on the part
!of the Austrian troops to come over to the
French. He fays that after the repeated and
contradictory melTages which he has received
from the council, he entreats his majesty to ac-
ccpt of his resignationâstill profefimg hisat
attachment to his country, and his determina
tion to defend the State against all its enemies,
according to the oath he had taken.
Pari 1 , by the lafl: accounts was quiet, notwith
standing many infamous attempts to excite the
people to outrage.
The news of the atrocities committed at
Lifie made a much deeper impression than the
defeat of the army ; but there were said not to
be lb bad as at firft represented, particularly no
Austrian prifuners were maflacred. M. de Bi
ron mentions in handsome terms the behavior
of the two sons of M. d'Orleans who were vo
lunteers in the army, and in the late attions.
Several letters were read in the National
Assembly from the municipality of Valencien-j
nes, dated.May 4 and 6, setting forth what
they con9eiyed to be the causes of the late mif
fortues,'that the army was now fully sensible of
their error in distrusting M. Rochambeau, and
that they desired nothing more earnestly than
his continuing to command them, to give them
an opportunity of atoning for the injustice they
had done him.
M. Prouveur moved a representation to the
King to continue M. Rochambeau in the com
mand. This motion was opposed as unconsti
tutional; and it was proposed to vote, that M.
Rochambeau had continued to deserve the con
j fidence of the National Assembly. After some
j debate.on the form, it was carried in the fol
lowing terms :
The National AfTembly having heard a letter
read from the municipality of Valenciennes,
the confidence which the citizens
and the army have profelTed in M.Rochambeau,
resolves that mention shall be made in the mi
nutes, of the fatisfaftion with which the read
ing of this letter was heard by the AlTembly,
and palled to the order of the day.
At the opening of each fitting, since the de
claration of the war, a number of patriotic
gifts have been received.
An attempt it feeras has been made to burn
the house of commons and would have succeed

prevented ; an old pair of breeches containing
combuitibles, on fire and part was
found in a small cloi'et, a hole was made in the
deling above the fire ; no further discoveries
had been made.
By accounts from the State of New-York it
appear?, .that Mr. Jay lias received the most
flattering testimonials of the refpeft and at
tachment of the citizens of Lanfingburg, Al

B. STODDERT.THE CONSPIRACY OF KINGS.
Bv JOEL BARLOW, ESSUIRE.
(CONC L UDID.)
A NDdidftihou hope, by thy infuriate quill
JTx. To rouse mankind the bloo 1 ot realms 10 spill ?
Then to restore, on death devoted plains,
Their scourge to tyrants, arid to man his chains ?
To swell their fouls with thy own bigot rage,
And blot the glories of so bright an age ?
Firll stretch thy arm, and, with lels impious might,
Wipe out the itars, and quench the solar light :
" For hcav'n and earth" the voice of God ordains,
" Shallpafs andpcri/h, but my word remains."
Th' eternal Word, which gave, iu spite of thee,
Re ason to man, that bids the man be free.
Thou couldfl not hope : 'twas Heav'n's returning grace,
In kind compaflion toourinjur'd race,
Which ftript that loul, ere it fliould flee trora hence,
Of the last garb of decency or sense,
Left thee us own foul honors to display,
In all the blackness of its native day,
To fink at last, from earth's glad futface hurl'd,
7 he fordid iov'reign of the ietter'd world.
n some fad hour, ere death's dim t rrors spread,
Ere leas of dark oblivion whelm thy head,
Rvflcft, 101 l man,â II thole, thy kindred knaves,
O'er the broad Rhine whose il<ig rebellious waves.
Once draw the sword ; , burning point lhall biinj
ro ihy quick ncrvrs rÂ« :i vcr.ending firing ;
The blood they ihed thy weight ot wo shall fweii,
And their grim ghofls 'orever with thee dwell.
Learn hence, ye tyrants, ere ye learn too late,
O. all your a alt tlf inevitable fare.
Tlie hour is come, the world's unclosing eyes
Dilcern with rapture where its wiidom lies ;
Jrom western heav'ns th' inverted Orient springs,
The mom of man, the dreadful night of kings.
Dim, like the day-fliuck owl, ye grope in light.
No arm for combat, no resource in flight ; H
If on your guards your lingering hopes repose,
\ our guari.s are men, and men you've niude your foes ;
If to your rocky ramparts ye repair,
De Launay's iate can tell your fortune there.
-No turn, no fliift, no courtly aits avail,
Each mask is broken, all iiluhons fail;
Driv'n to your last retreat ot fharne ana fear,
One counsel waits you, one relief is near :
Ry worth internal, rife to felf-wrought fame,
i cur equal rank, your human kindred claim ;
' Tis Reason's choice, 'tis Wisdom's final plan,
To drop the monarch and cfiumethe man.
Hail Alan, exalted title ! firft and best,
On God's own image by his hand imprest ;
I o which at last the reas'ning race is driv'n,
And leeks anew what firfl it gain'd from Heav'n.
OMan, my brother, how the coidial flame
Of all endearments kindles at the name !
In every clime, thy visage greets my eyes,
In every tongue, th) kindred accents rife ;
1 he thought expanding swells my h art with glee,
It finds a 11 iend, and loves itlelf in thee.
Savthcn, fraternal family divine,
\l hom mutual wants and mutual aids combine,
Say from w hat source the dire delusion iofi,
That fouls like ours were ever made for foes ;
Why earth's maternal bosom, where we tread,
'l o rear our matificns and receive our bread,
Should blush so often for the race (he bore,
So long be drench'd with floods of filial gore ;
Why to fpiall realms tor ever reft confin'd
Our great affections, meant for ail mankind ?
7hough climes divide us, (hall the ftrcam or sea
1 hat forms a barrier 'twixt my friend me,
Infpirethe wish his peaceful ftateto mar,
And meet iiis falchion in the ranks of war ?
Nut seas, nor climes, nor wild ambition's fire
In nations minds could e'er the wi(h inspire ;
' , " e c< 3 u sl rights each sober voice {hould guide,
No blood would {lain them, and no war divide.
'Tis dark deception, 'tis the glare of state,
Man funk in titles, loft in Small and Great â¢
'Tis Kant, Didintlion, all the hell that fprin'gs
'hole prolific monitors, Courts and Kings.
In tL arc the vampires nurs'd on nature's spoils ;
For thrfe with pangs the (tarving peasant toils,
