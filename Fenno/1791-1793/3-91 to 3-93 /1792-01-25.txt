FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER.
MR. DUNLAP,
'"OHOSE who found alarms to the people, may
A be either watchful patriois, or wicked in
cendiaries, according to theoceaiion, Thole who
advise the people to eltablilh a good goveninieur,
and then keep a Uriel eye upon ii, are always
their friends, inasmuch as the best governments
require this check againfl abuses. 1 hose who
tell the people to divide the trult of government
among different sets of hands, and then goto
flecp, mult he falfe friends, if they be not open
enemies. The language of fucli politicians is
this: ' When power is in different branches, they
will watch one another while the people are
nfleep ; ancl as one or other must lose by every
plot, the loser will be a marplot : but ftippole
the plot should be so contrived, that the whole
government (hould be thegainer, and the people
only the loser. â
Who is to be the marplot then, if the people are
asleep ? Look, fir, at the British government.
Its branches are fcparated according to order.
Each has its peculiar character and interefb ; all
are trimmed and arranged, and checked, and
poised, and balanced according to weight and
measure. Here surely mult be marplots in abun
dance. Here fin ely the people may sleep on
and take their re fir, in full confidence that no
attempt will be made on their rights ; and that
no public measure will enrich the members of
the government at their expence. Ask the ho
ned Britons if this be so ? Enquire what are the
fruits of this tree, whofc fiour'tjhing branches are
so well arrangedâYou will be told, that, for
thole who can climb into ihen>,the fruits they
bear are apples of gold ; but for those who dwell
under their .liadow, the bitter-leaves they drop,
are taxes without endâRellriiftions without num
berâofficers wirhout principle, and peculations
without punifluuent.
Americans ! you have done well iii planting a
tree, whose branches are well poised, and capa
ble of producing good fruitâYou will be no
ionger wife, if you go to sleep under it. D.

And 'mong their (hipping made great (laughter.
While even goddelles and gods.
In this dire conteff fell at odds ;
Till Jove provoked, afTumed h'.s arms,
And shook Olympus w,ith alarms ;

How traitorous Sinon from the horse,

While they in Somnus' arms lay snoring ;
Which caused in Illiumfad deploring.

The raptures of connubial love.
May no event your bliss annoy,
Andfo'isand <1 ughters aid your joy ;
And children's children hand your name
To the last page, infcrib'd by fame.
And when the race of life is o't^r,
And time winds up its springs no more,
To yon blest regions may'you rife,
And join your pavtner in the fkics,
Where marriage shall no more be known,
But love, immortal joys shall crown.

human imagination from time immemorial 10 the p>efent hour,
'hat never has been substantiated, nor realizedâand judging fiom

" The Ship ai'rived here about fix days

1400 barreils of flour, which is fold at 9 current

Fleming, from Philadelphia, and has been fold
at 10 5-4 current dollars per barrel. The Hava
na merchants call for no other flour but that of
Philadelphia, the Baltimore quality being en
tirely disapproved, owing to a cargo imported
lately from laid place, which made the bread
fourilh, (owing, 1 suppose, to the flour being too
old, or damaged) and, from the event, they will
not buy any but that from Philadelphia, excepc
through neceflity."

The Afleinbly called for the order of the day
The commiflioners appointed to examine the
archives, reported that the number of papers
contained in them was so great, that to examine
the whole would have taken several months. M.
Camus, the archivilte, had promised to give them
an abftradt of the whole within two days, and
had kept bis word. This abftracft they had found
so ably made out, so clear in arrangement, and
so accurate in its details, as far as they had had
the means of examining them, that they thought
it more honorable to adopt it, and inform the
afleinbly, to whom they were indebted for it,
than toprefent any thing less perfetft of their own.
The reading of this abftrait, which contained
an admirable account of the committees appoint
ed by the constituting aflembly, the powers
â which the neceflity of the times;' had obliged
them to aflame, the powers which they ought
to exercise in less arduous circumstances, what
progiefs each of them had made in' the matters
laid before them, and theready means by which
any new committee might take up the fame sub
jetfts, where the former committees had left
them, took Â«p the greater part of the day.

LONDON, November 16
Very warm debates lately took place in the
Polifli Diet at Warsaw, occasioned by a propof'ed
revision of the Administrative Commiflions, part
of which for the Crown, and part for the duchy
of Lithuania. The King and his party triumph
ed, as usual, over all opposition. Several arti
cles at lfcngth were unanimously agreed to, which
equally favor the Crown of Poland and the Du
chy of Lithuania.
Theodore Ropp, an inhabitant of Lithuania,
has fettled a fpm of money for portioning three
poor girls annually on the 3d of May, in com
memoration of the Polifli revolution.
The liberty of the Press gains ground even at
Vienna. A work is lately publi/hed there, with
the pcrmiflion ofgovernment, entitled, " Of the
duty of Monarchs, and the Provincial States, to
alleviate ibe burden ot the public expences, and
of that of subjects, not to pass the limits of obe
dience." In this treadle the author declaims a
gain ft the exemption of the Nobility and Clergy
from taxes, and the iiij u slice of confining the molt
diftinguilhed and lucrative employments to the
former. He reprobates a!fo the game laws, as
deftruc r tive of agriculture, andperfonal servitude
as pregnant with every political mifchief.
Sorcery, though extindl in nioft parts of tiie
world, ft ill exists at Rome, where the reverend
Father Altizza was lately seized for this crime,
by order of the Holy and enlightened office of
Inquilirion.
The Chevalier Erao, has seized, two Tunisian
cruizers,under the cannon of Baftia, in the island
of Corsica. The Bey has reclaimed them from
the French commandant, and declared, that,
if tKey are not delivered up within the space of
two months, he will declare war againlt the Na

M. Collot d'Hei bois has gained the prize of

M. Collot has presented the sum received, a

I n many particulars we think the new confti
tutiaii of France much better than our own ; and
especially in those most important points, which
relate to the election and duration of "the repre
sentative body, and to the entire separation of
religion from politics. On the fubjeJt of this
lnlt article, one cannot but admire at the perti
nacious ItifFnefs of our civil and eccleliaftical ru
lers. Our countrymen are but too visibly cramp
ed in their religion, violated in their morality,
and ensnared in their consciences. If thisiUand
should still persevere in imposing telts and sub

alliance of church and state is no less wifely than
virtuously diflolved in a neighbouring kingdom

if we continue to impede, and confound and eni
barrafs the kingdom of Heaven by mixing it with
the kingdom of this world, after they have been

not scruple to ftigmafize as an assembly 0 f infi

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF R E PRESENTJTIVES,
FRIDAY, December 30, 1791.
A Motion Jor referring the Petition of the Inhabitants
of Northumberland Cerl/ity, againfl the Excise, to
the Secretary of the Treaftiry, occaftoned some con
versation. *
MR. GILES objected to such reference as im
properâHe thought the fubjedt coguiza
ble by the House only.
Mr. Gerry made some remarks, which were
opposed to a more particular attention to this pe
tition than to others 011 the fame subjectâHe
thought the petition improper, as it prays for a
repeal of the lawâhe threw out some reflections
on the people of the Western counties for their
want of patriotifin, in not paying taxes for the
fupportof t heir Hate government âand now, said
he, they appear to wiih to get rid of all contribu
tion for the support of the general government
also.
[ Mr. Findley observed that it Had been custo
mary to refej- the petitions to the Secretary of
the Treasury. If this regulation had not been
adopted, he fljould now be opposed to ii. He
replied to Mr. Gerry, and defended the charac
ter of the people of the WÂ«itern countiesâsaid
they had paid their taxes for the support of the
state government with promptitude. Observa
tions of a contrary kind, he knew, had got into
the newspapers, which he thought were very un
candid ajid improperâbut he was sorry to hear
such obfervationsfrom the members of thishoufe
The present petition, however, is not, said he,
from a Western county.
The motion for the reference was agreed to.
On the Report of the Select Committee refpefliag Re
ceipts and Expenditurts of Pub lie Monies.
Mr. Livernrore rose for enquiry as to the de
nomination of legislative proceedings which this
report was to receive, whether it was to be en
acted into a law, or to be considered as a (landing
rule of the house.
Mr. Gerry repliedâHe said the objetft was to
obtain such information, from time to time, as
was necedary to forming a judgment relpedting
the propriety of additional taxes. The com"
mittee has taken such steps as they thought pro
perâthe result is before the house, and it re
mains for them to dispose of it as they may think
properâhe however thought that there would be
a propriety in making it a standing rule of the
houseâhe said it would be adting agreeable to
the Constitution, which expressly fays that such
an account (hall be exhibited.
Mr. Livermore said he could net fee any pro
priety in this mode of proceedingâhe was in fa
vor of as full an investigation into the expendi
tures of public money as any manâbut he tho't
that no rule or standing order of the house could
controul the law. A law is already enacted for
the regulation of the Treasury Department ii
this law is defective, it may be amendedâbut he
had no idea of* doing buiincfs in tliis way.
the gentleman has observed, wa have a right tc
call for such an account whenever we please a
greeable to laws already ena<fted, and therefor*
the reflations appear to be fnpercededâbefules
he doubted whether the power of this house ex
tended to the making rules which fjiall bind an'
future C f
-ongrefs.
Mr. Giles undertook to (hew, from the Confti
ution, that one Congress had a right to prescribe
ules for a subsequent shewed that
everal difad vantages would accrue from thecon
rary position, and in fad: do already exist in con
eqttence of the house having atfed on the oppo
lte luppofiuon. '
Mr. Gerry contended that the regulation pro
ofed was ncceffary, in order to securing this im
portant objert-the house has a right to call for
his information ; the Conftieution has made it
our duty to do i o, and we have a right,to fay in
what manner and at what periods this informa
tion lhall be received.
Mr. Bourne said he conceived the resolutions
were entirely fuperfluous, as the law was exprels
on the fubjecft. He called for the reading the
lawâwhich was done. s
Mr. Barnwell spoke in favor of the resolutionsâ
Mr. Livermore denied the right of one house
to impose rules on another_He said the supposi
tion, in his opinion, was contrary to several ex
pvefs provisions in the Condition ; to prove
* refcrred t0 Several pans of the inftru-
310
Mr. Murray Was of opinion that the practice of
the house jultified the adoption of the resolutions
now under considerationâhe referred to the Se
cretary of the Treasury's report 011 maoufa&ures
which had been ordered by a former house and'
received by the present. '
Mr. Gerry,'in reply to Mr. Bourne, observed,
(hat the article in the law jo ft read, had refpec't
only to the eflimates of receipts and expenditures.
An eflimate, he supposed, was a very different
thingfrom an account.
Mr. Williamfon fuppofted the resolutions He
said the present Congress had.a right to make
such rules and regulations refpeding ihe treasu
ry as they thought proper; and to fay thatthofe
rules shall be perpetualâstill a future Congress
may repeal them, and establish others which they
may fay fnall be (landing rules.
Mr. Niles wished foine rules similar to those
proposed fhocM be adoptedâHe denied the risht
of one Congress, in its rliles and
bind another. On this principle, the present
house may chufe a speaker for a subsequent house.
The question never has been for repealing the
rules and regulations of a former house ; but
whether they shall be adopted ?â He wished for
a law on the subject, but w as oppoled tp the bn
linefs in its present form.
Mr. Clark was in favor of adopting some mÂ«a
fures to obtain the information in questionâbut
he thought the present house had no more right
to bind a future house by a (landing rule iij this
refpedt, than they have to fay that the speaker
of the next house (hall wear a tye wig He moved
an amendment, by makingtherefolution toread
" that the return (hould be made on the foiirth
Monday of October next." This motion was se
conded, but not agreed to.
One of the resolutions offered by the commit
tee, after some modification, was agreed to ; the
other rejected.
MONDAY, January 23
A letter from the Comptroller of the Treasury
was read, inclosing a statement of the extra ex
pences, not allowed, incurred by the Commissi
oners appointed to treat with the Creek Indians.
Sundry petitions for pensions, compenfatious,
&c. were read and referred.
The order of the day being called for, on the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the
petition of Catharine Greene, several member
objected to taking op this business, being of a
private nature, while matters of the greatelt
public importance demand the immediate atten
tion of Congress. . The question being taken,
the motion for going into a committee of the
whole on this bnfinefs was carried, 21 to 16
And Mr. Livermore took the chair.
After a lengthy debate, the question was put
for agreeing to the fir ft resolution, in the fol
lowing words :
*' Resolved, as the opinion of this committee,
That the estate of tlVe late Major General Grcyne
ought tofce indemnified for the engagements en
tered into by that General, with certain persons
in the State of South-Carolina, for the purpose
of obtaining supplies for the army of the United
States, under his command, in the year 1783.
Which was negatived, 28 to 25.
The committee then rose, and the chairman
reported that the committee of the whole house
had had under consideration a report of the.Se
cretary of the Trea(ury on the petition of Catha
ri.ie Greeneâand had come to no resolution
thereon.
Mr. Macon then moved that the committee of
the wnole should be discharged from any further
proceedings on the fubjecftâ which motion was
agreed to.
Mr. Bourne then laid on the table a refolutien
for referring the Secretary's report,together with
Mis. Greene s petition, and the vouchers accom
panying it, to a feledi committee, with instruc
tion to enquire into the facfts which rendered it
neceflhry tor General Greene to become security
to Banks arid Co. and the nature, circumstances,
ami amount of the original debt, and the obliga
tions entered into by General Greene for pay
meat thereof; with an account of the monies or
collateral security received by the obligees, or by
General Greene in his life time, or his represen
tatives since his death, in part thereof ; and the
eventual lof's which his estate will sustain in con
sequence of the said securities sâand5 âand after exa
mining all the circumstances, and such further
evidence as may be offered relative to the tranf
acftion, to report their opinion thereon to the
house.
A mefTage was received from the President of
the United States, by Mr. Secretary Lear, con
veying certain documents received from the Le
gislature of the State of Virginia, refpediing lands
located by the officers and soldiers of the Virgi

"â  A gentleman, who amoved in town last evening, from Port

offer the following resolutionâ
Resolved, That the prayer of Thomas Leiper's
petition cannot be granted.
Saturday last arrived in town from FortWafh
ington, Major-General St. Clair, Governor of
the Western Territory.
A letter from L'leut. Jeffers, dated Jan. 4, at
Fort Franklin, mentions that all was quiet there
at the date of his dispatches.
ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS,
It is worthy of cor.fideration, how far the public good can be
supposed to be the obje& of those who censure public mcafures af
ter the event of them is known.âln a free country, every citizen
is supposed to enjov the right of being fully informed of the rea
sons on which drafts on his pocket are foundedâthe motives of
< very public enterprize, and the condutt of every agent of public
ffairs.
How far these fubje&s have been disclosed, let the numerous
publications on each of them teftifyâSo fully are our civil rulers
imprefled with this idea, that the government is suspended on the
public confidence, that no parallel! in the history of society can be
produced,of so scrupulous and universal an attention to inform the
public mind. ,
Our government is youngâthis idea does not efcapc the notice
of its enemies. For, aftonifliing as it may appear, there are not
wanting those, even among persons of ability, who conceive tha
either their own advantage, or the pnblic happiness, is connected
with prostrating every barrier that defends the lives, the propertv,
the peace, liberty and fafety of the people ; hence they consider
the present as the favorable moment to attack the governmentâ
This is done in various ways ; principally bv lies and misrepre
sentationsâTruth they are sensible is not of their party; thev
therefore have never paid any court to its influenceâthey entrench
themselves in falfhood, and from thence they discharge their ar
rows tipped in gall ai>d venom. But the people fee and judge
for themselves ; and (hielded in an impenetrable confidence in
the men whom they have chosen to administer their governmrr t,
the efforts of anarchy prove abortive. But as every good thing in
this world must pay a tax, so the prosperity of our country
the general success of public measures, appear to have llirred up
the mod latent feeds of chagrin and vexation ; and hence we may
expect more last words from the dying struggles of an expiring
antipathy to the tranquility ot the United States.
311
GEORGE WASHINGTON,
President of the United States.
Public credit depends principally on the view of sure, unmort
gaged, substantial revenues. If the 5 per cent, impolt had been
put into the hands of the old Congress, public credit would im
mediately hdve been reftoied. They never were accused of facri
ficing the public revenues to their own interest, or to the indul
gence of pulHons. There was always a fufficient confidence in
their wifdomand difmtereftcdnefs ; and their want of credit arote
entirely from their want of revenues.
The price of continental money, and of the other circulating
paper emitted by the old Congress, as it now fells in the London
market, does not (hew the (fate of the public creait of thiscoun
try, but only the operation of a particular law. I f any of the pa
per of the United States is now felling there from 120 to 150 per
cent, it only proves that we have allowed a high intcretl. A hito
dred dollars of the old continental bills now fell tor one dollar in
specie; but should Congress pass a law that they (houtd be re
deemed according to the original promise, and allow back interest
upon them from the time at which they ought to have been re
deemed, one dollar bill would then probably fell in the London
market for two dollars in specie ; but it would not be full proof
that the public ercdit oi this country was two hundred times bet
ter than it now is.
" In causes of defence, 'tis belt to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems ;
So the proportions of defence arc fill'd,
Which of a weak and niggardly projection,
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
Of a little clolh."
To effect any object the means muftbe proportioned to the end'
and fomcthing should be added tor contingencies.
What prudent Captain bound on a month's voyage, would re*
drift his ships Itbres to thirty days allowance ?
What the plan of our future military operations will be, time
will discloseâbut we may jullly expect, that, guided by experi
ence, government will adopt the mod economical plan, by making
thctnoft ample provision for the effective defence of the frontiers.
There are always existing in every country, and under the best
governments, real or imaginary causes of complaintâthese are
occasionally made nfe of to answer the purposes of individuals;
experience shews us in the hiftotyof free countries particularly,
that the public good is not contemplated by the majority of pub
lic complainants.
In Great-Britain this obferviti m has been verified in the most
striking manner, a thousand times. Stockjobbing is the spring
that gives motion to the pen of (lander, defamation, and falfe re
ports; if the credit or ftabilitv of the miniiler, or his plans can
thereby be affected, the object of such perfonsis gainedâfor the
decline of the ftoeks is the buying seasonâand innumerable arc
the arts employed on such occasions.
America has a debtâfpeculaiions in this debt have become a
gteat object to monied men, both natives and foreigners. lit
great rife of late, it is said, has been contrary to the expectations
of many ; thole who have waited for a Jail âand those who have
recently fold out, are interested in a rcduftion of the current
price.
Whatever motives of patriotism may have influenced the au
thors of some late ftri&urcs on the conduct of the Secretary of the
Treasury, it is highly presumable, that those publications are
the work of, or instigated by, ihe buyers q[ the public debt, par
ticularly some foreign ones.
It has been obfei ved that every measure of government which
has been in the remotell degree calculated to promote manufac
tures in this countrfy has received some opposition. But, fays a
correspondent, it is undoubtedly a criterion ot patriotism to af
ford them due encouragement ; nor is it easy to conceive, how
any man, even from the Southern States, can be inimical to the
cftablifhment of those branches of them, which experience shews,
we need not be any longer dependant on Europe tor.
In Europe, manufacturers and artizans are said to be but a de
gree removed from slaves, In the United States this can never be
the cafe, so lopg as our millions of unlocated territory remain to
be fettled ; nor does it follow of course, that because the Euro
pean artificer receives but a mere pittance for his laborâthe Ame
rican manufacturers should be a meagre, pale, starveling crew of
cmaciated wretches ; the heavy chaiges of importation which
will be saved, will enable us to give an enhanced price to our
workmen ; and the cheapness of our raw materials is another
great advantage.
How far Lu x u R y is or is not beneficial or pernicious to a state,
has been a qurition of much fanciful and ingenious dilcuffionâ-
which remains, and will remain, unfcttled. In relation to very
rich countries, much may be fa id in its favor. Perhaps it is in
such countries necefTary to diffufe the wealth among the commu
nity, which might otherwise stagnate in a few hands, and to give
support to a great number of industrious individuals, who might
otherwise want it. But in a country which is not rich, or, like
the United States, in a state of mediocrity, as to wealth, which does
not abound with a variety of elegant manufactures for the lupport
of" its luxury,butis obliged to derivea supply of them fron? abroad,
in exchange for the fimpAe produ&ions of the foil, or some tem
porary and adventitious resource, there can be no danger of
mistake in pronouncing that luxury, or expenjive living, is the moth
of public happiness. It cannot require the gift of prophecy to
foretell that the degree of it, whieh at present exists, will prepare
the way for public distress at a period not far diilant. It is then
a clear dut) of patriotism to discountenance it, and to clieiifh, by
example and precept, frugality and moderation.
TICKETS.
OUR politics have got the rickets,
Hencc they forbid the |j|le of tickets;
But laws that run againit the grain,
Will (hew their objeÂ£l is in vainâ
The world, whate'er Tome people fay,
Like hogs will run the contra wayâ
Since fortune evermore advises,
That tickets bo't by stealth are prizes.
