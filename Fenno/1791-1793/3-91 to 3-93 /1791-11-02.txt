[No. 54, of Vol. lII.]
ANSWER of M. SYEYES,
To Dh. Paine s Letter 9 and to several other publi
cations of a fitnilar nature.
IT appears that the question depends entirely upon the manner
of crownmg the government. What the monarches would do
by individual umtv, the lepublicans would do by a colleflivt
body. Ido not accuse the lad of failing to perceive ihc neref.
fity of unity in aftiou, and I do not deny that it may be possible
to e(hbli!h this unity in a senate or superior council ot execution.
But I believe, that it would be ill-constituted under a multitude
el repoits of committees; and that, in order to prefervi all the
advantages of which the unity of adion is capable, it fnould not
be leparated from ir.dividnal unity.
Thus, i.i our tyftrro, the government is composed of a fit ft mo
narch, the elefierand irresponsible, in whose name aa fix mo
narch!, named by him and rcfponfible. After thel'e are the di
iettories of the departments.
In the other, a senate or council, named by the departments,
or by the legifl.Uive assembly, would be in the fiift degree of ex
ecution ; then the administration of the departments.
Those who aim at iriveftigating an image with abft'raft notions,
may figure a monarchical government as ending in a point, and
a republican government in a platform ; but tile advantages which
we attribute to one form rather than the other, are so important,
that they cannot be conveyed by a simple image. I do not give
the cxpofition of them ; this is not the place ; but I am not un
willing to repeat, that in the two points here mentioned, consist
the aiftmftive charaQers of the two fyltcms ; that is to fay, the
difference which there is between an individual responsible de
cifton, withheld by an irresponsible eleding will, and a decision
bya majority discharged of all legal responsibility. The confe
rences will be deduced elfewheie * j
The republicans and we, may, moreover, differ upon many
great queltions, referring to social regulation, though there mat be
no reatoii to acknowledge any difference between republicani fn.
and monarchifm. For example, several combinations .niy be
"nagined in the election of the council or senate of execution,
with the delign of extending them more or less to the deliberating
admimftrative bodies. So may we alfoada.it, that there may be
more than one method proper to regulate what is called the fu<-
eeliion to the throne : for there is a latitude of opinion .o be ei
er ' re P u blican or a monavcliift, according to several varieties.
J" 13 fnc s u ' reÂ£ '' and * h av e no doubt that the enquiry will be
made, what is my opinion with refpeft to the hereditary right of
the monarch elcfiorâl answer without hesitation, that, in good
theory, a hereditary tranfmiflion of an office, whatever it is, can
never accord with the laws of a true representation. Hercditary
â¢ up, in i his KTife, is as inueh an attaint upon principle, as an out
rage iion iocicty. But let us refer to the history of all elective
monarchies or principalities. Is there one in which the elcttive
m Â»;k S Â° 0t wor s e â han the hereditary fucceffson ?
What more than they have done could have been performed in
the two years palt by men, at bottom, like others ; that is to fay,
who can judge only by that whioh they know, and who, for the
molt part, know that only to be possible which has been already
cone . And if they had thought themselves able to enter into the
examination of this question, wouhi it have been for them to ba
lance against an absurd, but peaceable hereditary (hip, the equally
a. ur cultom of ekflion, which is alio oftentimes accompanied
wit a civil war p At present, indeed, we are habituated to an
elective mode, and have fufficiently refl fled to believe, that there
ni ~, tx a S rcat variety of combinations in that refpeft.
Incte is certainly one very applicable to the firtt public fnnc
lion. It appears to mc to unite all the advantages attributed to
Hereditary without any of its inconveuiences ; and the advanta-
T t ek^' on >. wiltlout 'Â«Â» dangeis. Nevertheless, lam far from
thinking that cirtumftjnc.es are favorable for producing a change
in 111s refpetl of the decreed Constitution, and lam very glad to
deliver my opinion strongly upon this fubjeft. The obilacks, I
admit, are no longer the fame ; but have they therefore all dis
appeared and have not foinenew ones arisen ? Would an interior
aivihon bean indifferent tranfaftion, at the yra in which we are
P acc . 1 lie National Assembly is f( cure of the union of all parts
0 prance for the Constitution, as already known.
n universal wilh appears for the completion and the confirm
ation of it throughout with uniformity, and with a force capable
Â° g ,v,n g empire to the law. Would it bereafonable to take this
roomeni tor throwing an apple of discord in the midst of the de
partments, and hazarding incongruities in the decrees, to which
"might be hereafter so difficult to place limits? If the nation will
ex P^ a ' n "frlf by a Constituent Aflembly as to the place of
e t onarch, whether it (hall become elective, or remain here
"ai yÂ» may not, on that account, lose monarchy, since there
xl' i) 3 wa ) s rcma ' n what is its eflcnce, an individual decision, as
1 C f^Â° n r t 3rt a^'n g Monarchs, as the Monarch elector.
n ort, I hope, that as the public opinion is fimplifyjng more
n more in political matters, the triangle monarchy will be ge
era y perceived to be more suitable than the republicanism plat

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AUGUST 29.
Monday evening an extraordinary fitting
Vv was held on the intsreftinglituation ofthe M
and of St. Domingo, which lalted to the unusual
hour of n, and in which some warm personalties
were employed, that vill probably have fatal
consequences. A coalition seems to be formed
in the Colonial Committee, at the head of which
is M. Barnave, who iii.YTts upon the revocation of
the decree of the ijth of May.
M. De Tracy, Broftaret, Perifle da Luc, and
Rochefoucault, gave notice, that they should re
sign their places in the committee ; and in align
ing theirreafons for their resignation, these gen
tlemen successively displayed such a fceue of des
potism exercised in the committee, as to render
it impossible for any members ou: of the party
to be heard.'
August jr.
The order of the day was, the further consi
deration of the belt mode of fixing a national
convention for altering any part of" the present
conllitution.
The principal speech on this occasion, and up
on which the principalipart of the ensuing decree
was founded, was matfe by M. Frocheau, the
friend of the celebrate,4 Mirabeau.
After having demonttrated the principles of
the national sovereignty and the neceflity of not
departing from those on which representative go
vernments are founded ; he concluded, with pro
posing, that two forts of aflemblies lhould be ap
pointed, one of which, under the title of a na
tional convention, ftiouldjbe authorised to revise
retouch, and modify any parts of the conflitu
tion ; and the other, under the denomination of
the condiment aflembly, should be charged with
the funtftion of new modelling the conditution
entirely, if neceflary. The legislative body
should have the sole right of convoking one or
other of these aflemblies ; to have an authorita
tive efFe<ft ; three successive legislatures mud ex
press their desire with regard to the calling of
these aflemblies ; and in order to prevent cabal,
the fame members nuid not be eligible to the le
gislatures succeeding that which has began to
express its desire foi this change.
Many fpokeon this intereding fubjecft, among
the mod didinguifhed of whom was M. Barnave,
who with his usual precision, observed, that the
end of all government, is tranquility and liberty
conjoined ; but these two great advantages the
people themselves are modliableto destroy with
their own hands, from being led to aÂ£l by ge
neral ideas, under the guidance of artful and
eloquent demagogues, who have their own pri
vate views at bottom. The people are no doubt
the only legal sovereign ; when they have ef
tablifhed a representative government, the pub
lie power resides in those representatives ; the
people can only exercise the sovereignty by elec
tions.
The decree with which the debate ended, is
couched in the following terms :
" Whenever three following legislatures fliall
express a uniform wilh to reform a part of the
conflitution, a revision may take place.
" The fourth legislature shall be charged with
examining the articles on which the three pre
cedinglegiflatures fliall have demanded a revision.
" The members of the third legislature cannot
be named to the fourth."
M. de !a Fayette proposed, that the mode
adopted by the American States fliould be adopt
ed, accordinp to which the nominal appeal is re
sorted to in the three legislative aflemblies, and
the names ef those voting fora reform are print
ed. This proposal was referred to the commit
tee of constitution.
After this business was concluded, a numberof
curious and interesting papers were read rela
tive to the Isle of St. Domingo.

NEWBEfiN, Otflober Ij.
Last week a Sloop was call away on the coafl:
of this State, between Occacock y.nd Beaufort.
There were on board of her but one man, < who
fays his name is Nathan Round, and a lad named
Maxwell. The Cargo confiited of twenty-three
hoglheads of l'ugar, about twenty cases of gin,
a chest of tea, and a quantity of ca<h. The inha
bitants were very alert in saving the cargo, which
is now in the care of the custom-house officers at
Beaufort.
The condudt of Round has given canfe of sus
picion that he had nor a(fteil honeltly (his story
and that of the lad difagrceing in many relpeifts)
and as he had left the veflel, fails, rigging, &c.
and hired horl'es under pretence of coming to
this town, the infpeiftor of Beaufort came last
night in pursuit of him. He was this morning
apprehended and carried beforejudge Sitgreaves,
who, after examining him thought proper to com
mit him to gaol. Among his baggage were found
twelve hundred dollars and forne cloathes, which
he laid belonged to the captain.
He fays the schooner is called the Polly, be
longs to Brown, Francis, & Co. and was command
ed by Capt. Richard Low ; that they failed to
the Well-Indies, loaded with horses, mules, beef,
fifti, nankeens and thirty-two chests of tea âthat
while they were lying in Euftatia road, he sup
poses the cablc was cut by a Spanifli drogger who
was near him, the captain being then alhore ;
that lie sent the boy and all the hands, but this
lad, alhore for the captain ; but the wind begin
ning to blow frefh he was not able to keep the
veflel near that island, or making any of the
neighbouring ones, and that he then fleered for
the continent and came to anchor near where
the veflel was afterwards loft.
On his way from Beaufort, it is said, he inquir
ed the way to the Ohio, and when he was in this
town wanted to get to Norfolk. There was no
log-book or other paper found on board the ves
sel.
The money is lodged at the cuftoni-lioufe in
Newbern, and the veflel is ordered to be fold for
the benefit of the owners.
PROVIDENCE, Oc r t. 22.
Ac the Supreme Judicial Court of the Com
monwealth of Maflachufetts, holden at Taunton,
was tried last Thursday the Cause, William Gor
don, of New-Bedford, against Caleb Gardner and
John Stanton, of Newport.âThis was a popular
aiflion, grounded on the law of that Common
wealth, for preventing the Slave-Trade. The
plaintiff in his writ demanded 50C0I. forfeited
for the exportation of 100 Afi icaiis to the Weft
Indies as slaves, and 2001. forfeited for the velfel
employed in the voyage. The former demand,
in pursuance of the advice of the Abolition Soci
ety in this town, was relinquished, and on the
latter a verdiift was obtained by the plaintiff.
This mild and humane procedure 011 the part of
the Society mnll evince, that their objeiii was
more to give fandiion and efficacy to the law,than
to mulÂ«fi the violators thereof.âThe charges from
the court to the jury i.i this cause deserve to have
been written in letters of gold. Such Judges are
a terror to evil-doers, and a glory to a Coirnnon-

THIS day, at 12 o'clock, the Senate proceeded from their

United States, where the following Address, in answer to his
Speech to both Houses of CongrefÂ»> was delivered by the Vicc-
President:â
To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
Sir,
THE Senate of the United States have received with the highest
faiisfa6lion, the aflurancesof public prosperity contained in your
lpeech to both houles : the multiplied blcflings of Providence have
not escaped our notice, or failed to excite our gratitude.
The benefits which flow from the restoration of public and pri
vate confidence are conspicuous and important, and the pleasure
with which we contemplate them, is heightened by youralTurance
of thufe further communications which ihall confirm their exig
ence, and indicate their source.
Whilil we rejoice in the fuccefe of those military operations
which have been dire&ed against the hoilile Indians, we lament
with you the necellity that has produced them, and we participate
the hope that the present profpeft of a general peace, on terms of
moderation and justice, may be wrought into complete and pei
mancnt effect, and that the meafur:s of government may equally
embrace the ftcunty of our frontiers, and the general interefh ot

Tne fcvcral fubje&s which you have particularly recommended,
and those which remain of former.feflious, will engage our early

and steadiness, by the belief, that they will interest no paflion, but
that tor the general welfare, by the afiurance of concert, and by a
view of thole aiduous and important arrangements which have
been already accompiithed.

A memorial of JoCeph Seraki, a Roman artill,

was accompanied by a description of the proposed
monumentâlaid on the table.
The petition of Richard Blacklege, piefented
by Mr. Willianifon, on motion of that gentle
man, was referred to the Secretary of the Trea
sury.
ORDER OF THE DAY
In committee of the whole, on the schedule of
the whole number of persons in the United States.
Mr. Muhlenberg in the Chair.
Mr. Lawrance observed, that there were two
objects which piefented for the attention of the
committee 011 this occasion ; thefiril, the apporti
onment of the ratio of reprefemationâthe other,
t he situation of the census as it refpecfls the State
of South Carolinaâboth of tlieni important.
,lr. Lawrance proposed arefolution in regard to
ihe fir Itâl hat till the time of the next enume
ration, the number of Representatives fliall be one
to every thirty thonfand inhabitants. He further
obierved, that the census of South-Carolina not
214
being compleated, and returns made within the
time limited by law, it remains that some provj.
lion on that fubjeift fliould be made but as he
supposed the gentlemen from that State would
make a propoiition to the house, he fliould wave
any further remarks for the present. He con
cluded by repeating his motion, that the ratio of
l cprefcntation ihouid be one for every thirty
thousand.
Mr. Li verm ore Paid he was npprehcnfive the
motion would be premature, till the fate of an
amendment to the conitirution proposed to iit
people, was known ; th;it amendment fays that
the ratio of repi elentation (hall be one to every
30,000 persons, till the number of- lleprefenta
tives amounts to 100 âafter which the ratio is to
be one to 40,000 âIf this amendment is agreed to
the resolution on the table will contravene its
operation ; if that amendment: is not adopted
(and said he, 1 heartily wish it never may be)
we (hould 011 the proposition now moved, have a
larger houl'e than that amendment contemplated ;
he was opposed to lb large a number of repre
sentatives as would be confcquent on the plan
proposed, and concluded by enquiring whether
the above amendment had been adopted by the
requisite number of the Legillatures.
On examination it did not appear that a fuf
ficietn number of tlie States had made return*
refpe<fting the amendments to determine thr
question.
Mr. Sedgwick said the Constitution bad pro
vided that the number of Representatives /hould
not exceed one for every 30,000, but Congress may
encreafe the number of constituents of each mem
ber ; he read the l-efult of a calculation of the
number of Representatives which would be re
turned on a supposition of there being one to
3Â°> 33> 34 al] d 4Â° thousand personsâaccording
to the prel'ent ceiifus, fuppofiug South-Carolina
to contain 240,000 perfonsâ3o thoul'and would
give 110 â33, 104, 34, 100, and 40 thousand, 82
members.
Judging from the sense of the peoj)le, so far
as it could be collected from whac had been done
refpedting the proposed amendment on this fub
jecft, he was of opinion that the ratio which
would meet the general approbation was that
which would give about 100 members in the
House of Representatives.
Mr. Livermore was in favor of a ratio which
would give the smallest number that was men
tioned by the gentleman last fpcaking;
Mr. White said, that the general sentiment of
the people was perhaps more fully known on the
lubjetfc before the committee, than on any other
thac can come before thein. Among the objec
tions to the Conltitution, the finallnefs of thcre
prefentation was very generally objected to. An
eucrcafe of the number of this iioufe isexpet r cedâ
it has been said by the enemies of the Constitu
tion that Congress will never consent that there
lhall be a Representative for every 30,000 per.
sons. The time is now come when the que/tion
is to be determinedâand I hope, said Mr.White,
that Congress will a<ft with the utmost liberality
on the occalionâand that they will not diminifli
the number of Representatives.
Mr. Dayton Caul he considered the fubjedl in a
different light from the gentleman laftfpeaking.
He supposed the sense of the people at the pre
sent day was opposed to a great increase of the
number of Reprei'encaiivesâhe thought that one
to 40,000 pei Coiis would give the most eligible
number, but was willing to meet the gentleman
half way, and moved to insert the word fivt be
tween " thirty and thousand,"in the resolution.
Mr. White explained himfelf as referring par
ticularly to the time when the Constitution was
adopted
Mr. Seney observed, that the ful>je<ft was too
important, in It is opinion, to come to a fucklen
decision npon, especially as many of the mem

The diffidence I feel in my abilitirs to difchaTge, with propri

But encouraged by the known candor of this honourable body,
and depending, as I think I may confidently do, on the kind af
fiftanceof each individual in it, I (hall enter on its cjuties,"with full
aflurances to you, gentlemen, that I (ball endeavour to conducl
myfelfwith that impartiality, integrity and afliduity, which be

place me.
Philadelphia, November 2.
Monday a person was brought before the Mayor of this city, on
suspicion of having been concerned in the late attempts to burn
Philadelphiaâhe was, after examination, committed to jail.
The brig Hetty, Capt. Clouler, anived here on Monday, from
Cape-Francois. Caprain Cloufer left the Cape the 6th instant, and
coniradi&s the extract of a letter from New-York, published in
feveial papers.
When Capt. Cloufer failed, the Negroes continued obstinateâ
they refufed all terms of accommodation, but that of equal libertyâ
and the several attempts made to defeat them had proved fruitlcfs.
His Excellency William Patterson, Esq. is unanimously
re-elcfted Governor of the State of New-Jersey.
The Governor has been pleafcd to appoint Benjamin Chew,
Esq. one of the Judges, and President of the High Court ot Errors
and Appeals, of this Commonwealth.
Accounts from Port-au-Prince fay,that upwards
of 20,000 Negroes have risen and are encamped
in that quarter. The price of flour is limited ro
8 dollars. Provisions plenty.
Last Saturday arrived in the (hip Delaware,
Art, from Charleston, Maj. Gen. Wayne, Mr.
Governeur, Mr. Pelletie, and two other pas
sengers.
The Governor of this Commonwealth has is
sued a Proclamation, offering a reward of 500
dollars for apprehending any of the persons con
cerned in lately setting fire to sundry (tables in
this city. In addition to the above, a few private
citizens have offered a reward of 500 dollars for
the fame purpose.
NATIONAL BANK
Saturday last the Directors of the Bank of the
United States proceeded to the choice of a Cashier,
and on counting the ballots, a large majority was
found in favor of John Kean, Esq. of South-Ca
rolinaâ whereupon he was declared duly eletfted
Cashier of the said Bank.
The popularity of this cement of the Unionâ
the liberal principles 011 which it is bottomed â
and the respectability of the gentlemen who are
appointed to offices in it, mufi render the institu
tion highly beneficial to the people, and govern
ment of the United States; and will command
'he confidence of capitalists in Europeâwhose
property cinnot be as fafe in the confufion Which
perpetually reigns there, as in this tranquil
â¢ountry.
SCIOTO
A gentleman just arrived from Gallipolis, the
new French settlement on the Scioto, communi
cates the following information from that quar
ter. Ihe original number of the settlers has
greatly decreased : Owin gto various difappoint
"xntÂ« feme have returned. These had chiefly
carried with them a numerous train of depend
ants ; who fool) found that in a new country,
where indultry is the belt recommendation, they
could live independent and as well as their mai
lers,, and consequently left them almollto a man,
to leek their fortune in tlrst extenlive country.
1 litre the colony fulFered a considerable diminu
tion, and this desertion on the other hand, was
one of the causes that drove the wealthy part of
the fcttlers to France again. The number now
remaining, about 320, appear well pleased with
ilieii situation and determined to persevere.
! hey have not in a (ingle inltance been niolelted
by the Indians, who are often seen ci offing from
their tide of the river to commit depredations on
the American /ettlement immediately oppofiteto
them.
l he country there abounds with the greatest
quantity and variety of game imaginable, and
the liver is well stored with fifliÂ°of different
kinds. The foil isfurprifiiyrly fertile ; lefsthan
half an acre has been kuovrb to produce 67 bufti
els of Indian corn.
These new settlers have cleared about 590 acres
of land, and are every day makingimprovements.
A few years proinife to l ender it a settlement of
the firft importance. Its particular situation 011
the Ohio, yearly favours an iiicreafe, and we
may in a fbort time expect to fee it a second Ken
tucky.
The settlers now there ariÂ» chiefly men of in
dustry, and many persons of talents and educati
on. Perhaps more insight into the Botany Mi
neralogy, :jnd Antiquities of our country may be
expeifted from their labors, than from any source
whatever. They have among them an excellent
botanist, an eminent mineralogist and natural
philosopher ; who, however, have wifely resolv
ed in the infancy of their colony to handle the
ax and guide the plough, and to be at firft rather
attentive to improving the furface than searching
into the bowels, and less anxious todifcover new
and curious plants than to introduce ufeful ones.
Indeed their exertions in this way have alreadv
produced gardens abounding with all kinds of
vegetables in the highefl. perfection. From the
month of May they already begin to furnifh' a
plentiful supply for their tables. Steps are talk
ing to introduce fruit trees, to the growth of
which the climate and foil is very favourable.

COMMUNICATIONS
A correspondent present appear
ances in the National Legislature, presage an
harmonious session. The general happiness dif
fufed over the face of our country, is traced by
every man to its proper source.âthe Constitution
and Laws of the United Stales. The administra
tion of the general government has been peculi
arly fubfervienc to the belt ititerefts of our coun
try âSuch republican principles form thediftin
gnifhed features of every public addrefsand com
munication troin our civil fathersâthat posterity
will quote them as the oracles of freedom. On
the Aire bafisof public faith,credit and confidence,
is raised such a system of industry, energy and
enterprize among the people, as will in its effects
aftonilh mankind. The present feflion of Con
gress therefore will, in all probability, proceed
with that promptitude and decision in compleat
ing what remains to be finiflied, and in develop
ing and applying the principles of the Constitu
tion to the public exigencies, which is inspired
by the unparellelled success with which the mea
sures of their predecessors have been crowned.
A correspondent observes, that among the va
rious and very important objects recommended
to the attention of Congress by the President of
the United States, the lineaments of* diflinguifh
ed patriotism are moil forcibly pourtrayed on
the article refpe&ing the difTem inating of know
ledge and information among the people.
Government is made for the peopleâit is
therefore ellential to its support and preserva
tion, in connection with any degree of Freedom,
that they should know and approve of the reasons
and principles on which its ineafures are found
ed.â It is apparent from all the ordinances of the
old Congress refpetXing the Poft-Office, that let
ters otily are contemplated in all the arrangemens
that have heretofore been madeâbut fays our cor
respondent it is invaio to consult the inteieftsof
any particular class of men, without a proper at
tention to the means of enlightening and fatis
fying the great body of our citizensâthe securi
ty of property, the prosperity of trade and com
merce, and the enjoyment of all our civil rights,
and of every blessing of society, depend 011 the
tranquil and efficient operation of the general go
vernment âthis again depends on public opinion
that opinion, enlightened and unprejudiced by
inifiuformation, and misrepresentation, will eter
nally be in favor of a wife and jnft adminiftra
lion. How worthy then of that wisdom, which
the world hath celebrated, to take the moll ef
fectual ineafures to enfurc this great and impor
tant object
215
As experience is our best teacher, it would bean ufefulemploy
ment to compare the fituatiorr of the State Governments, at this
moment, with the appiehendons entertained by their friends be
fore the adoption of the national Conftnution. Inllead of bsing
crushed and rendered infignificant, as it was pretended they would
be, t here is not a Government that has not been a gainei by.the
new plan of Government, in point of wealth and power. The
treasuries of New-York and Pennsylvania are full, and indeed
ovetflowing into the nioft ufeful channels. The contrast of the
years 1787 and 1791, forms the eulogium of the pr< lent Govern
ment of the United States. After considering fails, we may in
dulge conjeÂ£luresâWhat more fatal blow could be given to the
refpe&ive State Governments, especially to the small States, than
weakening the government and union of the whole body politic.
It becomes us to judge, thercfoie, whether a zeal for the State Go
vernments is properly direfled, when it is made use of either to
narrow the bounds and to impair rhe force of the general autho
rity, or to make encroachments on Congress to the enlargement of
the iurifdi&ion of the State Government.
We are oneâby pretending to be more, we lhall be in danger
of becoming nothing.
It ;s called puffing to remark in the papers upon the prosperity
of our country. But truth is not puffing. Did any country ever
prolper more ? Did our oÂ«vn ever prosper so fact as of late ? The
sense of that prosperity makes us all happy. And when we fee
by the papers that the feutiment is universal, and is felt at the fame
moment by our we indulge a double fatisfadlion,
and we indulge it without restraint. There is not one social sen
timent that is not worth nursing. When men are brought to live
and think together, they will become better and happier. What
sentiment affords more pleasure than the love of our country â it ij
a-i enlarged felf love that embraces firft our country, and next the
world.
Ignorance is the enemy of mankind. Why is not mankind the
enemy of ignorance ? Why is no: all the virtue and wisdom in the
world employed against the common enemy ? Perhaps it is: butt
the iufferers loath their physic, and are jealous of their physicians.
The men of worth and talents arc called Aristocrats, and are point
ed out as the enemies of the country. Yet such men are found
the foremoft in every attempt to confer knowledge, or power,
which isthe fame thing, on the body of the people. Divines talk
about the millenniumâit will never come till ignorance is gone.
Knowledge, the knowledge of the body of the people, is worth
more than it would cost, and more than it is valued at. Learning
has not yet had credit for half the good it has done, and still less
for what it is capable of doing. It is time to provide for it.
It is agreed fnat men are what education makes them. Why
then do we neglect to provide for it ? Why do we not enjoin it by
law upon cities anddiftrifts of country to support free lchools, as
it is praÂ£lifed in New-England ? It is doing more than Sparta
did to make the youth the children of the public. The uses of
this provision cannot be numberedâstill !efs can they be cftimated.
It is probable, that during 20 ages, time will continue to disclose
new advantages, resulting from proper establishments for inftruft
ing the great body of the people. Who can fay how many vices
will be eradicated, how many social habits will be formed. The
rich can buy learningâit is a luxury. But to the poor it is a ne
reflfary, and to them, O Amei icans, it is denied. Let this reproach
be wiped off. We are proud of our cities, of their wealth and
extent, their public works, and edificesâwe make a parade of our
luxuryâand shall we not blush at the degraded state of great
numbers of the laboring poor ! What the town of Boston has done
to remove this stigma, deserves to be read.
An Albany paper, received by yesterdays' poll, gives an ac
count of the murder of Co rnei.ius Hog e :ioom, Esq. Sheriff of
Columbia Countyâby a party of 50 men, disguised as savages,
who started up from an ambush and fired a volly, by which ,the
above gentleman was killed on the spot. Particulars of tins affair

HERE on this bank, while fmne the stars so clear,
Come, Lucy, let us fit. How tranquil fcems
Ali naime ! With what mildness from above
Yon regent of the night, looks clown on earth
And gives toev'ry hf ib, tree, plant, and field,
A fofier green ! Mark now her virgin front.
How calm flie looks, how open, and how pure ;
Nor, Lucy, on thy paler beauty dwells
Less fwe.et ft renity. As pure art thou,
As frank, and as benignant as the light
Of that lair planet, when no vapour thin,
Flitting o'er ether, tarnilhcs her face
With momentary dimness. She, bright Queen
Of all those llarry gems which deck this vault
Magnificently built, her filvcr born
Monthly replenishes. From that strong blaze
Ol uncxhaufted glory, whose quick heat
Invigorates ihe world, (he Hill relumes
Her darken'd countenance. But, Lucy, thou,
When time shall Ileal ihofe youthful charms away,
From what full fountain of immortal grace,
W hat fun of beauty, (halt thou then repair
Thy form's diminifli'd elegance ? A'as !
That female lultre, laircr than all stars,
And dearer than the light which rules the day,
Should know no fccond rifmg : that once fct,
Nor months, nor years, nor ages can recall it.
But turn now, Lucy, and survey that cloud
Which comes in gloomiefl majefly along
Tofhrowd the imperial moon. Its envious shade
Now creeps upon her argent disk, and now
Blots it quite out from heaven, With such Health
Malice her thick and baleful darkness draws
O'er lucid virtue, and beneath that veil
Would hide it ever. But as now that cloud
Sails on, and back reftorcs the radiant moon
To man's defiringeyes, so pass the mists
With which fell Envy labors 10 conceal
The merit (he abhois. 1 hus tianfient too

Of England, (hook this kingdom with dismay ;

plasterer. He is a very handy fellow as a house-waiter, and is fond
of such business. He is a great dilfembler, and no doubt pretends
he is a freeman. He has been eloped so long that no delcription of
his prefeut clothing can be given. It is supposed that he went to
the Northern States, as he often mentioned having friends there.
Twenty Dollars reward will be given to any pei son that will fe

Holy Bible.âRoyal Quarto.
MR. THOMAS, of Worcester, Massachusetts, mod refpeft
lnlÂ°'ms 'he public, that he has this day completed the
Old and New Teliaments of his Royal Quarto Edition of the
HOLY BIBLE, The Apocrypha and Index, & c . will be fin idl
ed with all the dispatch the nature of the work will admit
Such Gentlemen as hold Subscription Pafers, he begs will
return them to him at Worceflcr, or to him and Company at Ito/lon
by the last day of November next, and as much foonei as they con
vemcntly can.
He is happy to inform the public, that the work lias been exa
mined by many gentlemen, clergymen and others, and has met
with their highest approbation; both as to the execution of the
printing, us correftnefs, and us cheapness compared with Enolilh
copies of the fame size and quality. Â®
As this very laborious and exceedingly expensive undertaking,
,s earned on fo.cly at his own cost, he is led to hope that all tliofe
who w,(h to possess a large Family Bible, will so far encourage this
.and,- Â«le undertaking of their countryman, as to add their names
to trw fuoicription.
