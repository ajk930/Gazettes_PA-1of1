[Concluded from our
MR. FENNO,
AS to the tendency of the bank to make im
mense profits for the itock-holders and offer
ino- such vast emolument to the adventurers in
it time will (hew what these will be ; the ex
perience of banking as yet in America, has not
exhibited such advantagesâand certainly it is
not likely the profits will encreafe with the com
petition, which is growing in this country : Pru
dent men will therefore look before they leap ;
they have time enough for any of the immense
preparations spoken osâsince they have two
years to turn themselves in before they complete
their payment of subscriptions to the bankâand
years are eternally offering something newâit
is but about ten since the bank of North-Ame
rica was founded by Congressâand had we at
that time, Mr. Fenno, been favored with your
Gazette, doubtless it would have applauded as
highly the favorite of the dayâwho tho now be
come less fafhionable, still retains the mod un
deniable right to the grateful affecftions of this
country âatid will continue I hope to deserve
them, till perhaps by the lapse of a few more
years (he may again return like other falhions in
to vogue
On the present occasion the bank of North
imerica has certainly atfled the part of a mod
lutiful child to the unionâperfectly lilent and
[uiefcent while the bill for a new bank was pen
lant before Congress, they now also are the re
ervoir where its treasures are to be accumulated
ind its subscriptions openedâexhibiting to the
Â»orld the very lingular f'peiftacle of one bank
tiding another in its eftablilhnientâtho for pur
poses calculated to avert the very sources of emo
lument from it ; so great and dilinterefted is the
attachment of the bank of North-America for
that of the United States that it seems to forget
what is due to itfelf in the care of the interests
of the rising inftitutionâungrateful will this be
formed if it attempts to injure its foftering
parent, or is unmindful as the magnanimous and
dilinterefted conduct, to which perhaps its ex
istence is to be so greatly ascribedâto the union
of the two, some constitutional obstacles indeed
oppose, and fortunately there are interests con
cerned in preventing itâbut from this amieable
beginning we are to suppose the new bank will
treat her elder lifter, with at least fonie returns
for the hospitality and kindness (hewn her, and
be anxious in future to preserve the house where
her existence had been nurtured and commenced.
Newbern, (N. C.) April 23
THE President of the United States and Major

his journey.

TO ELLA.
! vainly Ella, do I hear
Thy lute complain, in notes so clear,
As would fcduce an angel's ear ;
That bids me check, the song of praise,
And give to other themes, my lays.
To fierce disease and grief a prey,
In pain I pass the lingering day.
No more I raifethe sprightly {train.
Or warble the melodious song,
That fill'd the breast with envied pain y
And could the joys of life prolong.
Now, when the glowing erb of day,
Hath funk, beneath the western wave ;
With melancholy heart I stray
To hear the ftrean>his border lave.
Or like Come pilgrim press the yielding grass.
And wet my sandals with the nightly dew,
A sprig of laurel breaking as I pass.
To thee I fay the honoring branch is due.
My dangerous course along the vale I take,
Beneath the hanging rock, that seems to (hake
Withev'rv blast, and threatens oo my head
Its crushing weight to roll
But my undaunted foul.
Enjoys the scene, nor feels the chill of terror spread
Now, near a cavern dark, and wild,
With folded arms I stand,
Like melancholy's gloomy child ;
I heave the swelling sigh ;
Upon the palling gale ;
While from my ever-ftrec.ming eye ;
Adown my cheeks, so wan and pj'e,
The tears incessant drop upon my hand.
There I hear the moping owl,
His dismal whoopings roll,
Upon the heavy ear of night,
In founds that would thy foul affright.
But Oh ! my bursting heart!
So tortur'd by the fang of grief,
In other scenes would feck relief 1
On fancy's rapid wing I'd dait
Where horror with his ftanng eye,
And upright hair,
Sits gazing on the fiery sky,
When sulphurous lightnings fly,
And {well the foul to wild despair.
Where the vex'd wave with mad'ning roar,
Rolls thundering on the craggy shore,
And aims with ev'ry dreadful (hock,
To burst apart the flinty rock;
When fti II like wretched man! invaia
He strives his purpole to obtain ;
Mad to despair, he flics again
And clamours to his parent main.

IN out* last: we inferred a paragraph under the
Pennsylvania head, which mentioned, that jooolb.
of hemp were raised the last season, by Col. Wood,
011 the memorable heights ofCharleltown. Acor
refpondenc remarks, that the blood of the Ame
rican heroes, shed on those heights, in the unpa
rallelled action of Bunker's hill, &c. was in no
wiie spilt in vain. From those rich libations at
the sacred Ihrine of freedom, Colombia's inde
pendence took its date, and the blefling is once
more realized, by an extraordinary production of
so stable a commodity for manufactureâthat
grand palladium of national greatness, on which
the happinefsof America eflentially depends.
Thus tho the honored heroes reft in peace,
Their beneficial influence doth not cease,
That blood which freefy flow'd at freedom's call,
Wafts federal stripes around this spacious ball;
In distant realmrf, Columbia's flag unfurl'd,
Displays their worth to an admiring world ;
While from the forehead of a brightening sky,
They view their country's farms with Europe's vie.
With pleasure we inform our readers,that faith
ful posts are once more appointed, to ride regu
larly from Bennington to Windsor. Any com
munications may be made with fafety, and the
demand for services will be reasonable. Rider 3
are likewise established from Bennington to On
ion river, and the rout in a few weeks, will be
extended to the northern extremity of theftate ;
which eftabli(hment, if duly encouraged, will
no doubt be extensively ufefulâmore especially
as a regular communication with the filter States
is now permanently established.
'Tisby Intelligence Republic's live?
And a free service, not a ftavilh give j
Stop but the streams of knowledge, and you'll find,
The laws oppos'd, the people fa&iousâblind.

The following extrafl of a letter from London, andalfo that publijkcd
in our lajl*, were taken Jrom a series of letters; in which the writer
appears to be greatly interejled in the happiness and prosperity of the
people of this country, and solicitous that they may be guarded againfi
precipitation in forming their Commercial System. The
sentiments are thought to be deserving of public attention.
London, Jan. 179*.
DEAR SIR,
" V NOWING you to be a friend to commercial regulations,
X\. upon the belief that they may prove favorable to your na
tional interests, I ventured in my letter of the 21ft ult. to quote
to you the opinions of some refle&ing people upon the tendency
o\ all reftri&ive systems. You need not be told that here mercan
tile men and manufaÂ£iurers generally entertain sentiments quite op
posite to those I recited, and that a man who should be bold
enough to aflert seriously the advantages of freedom in trade and
industry, would find no strength of realoning nor purity of mo
tives fufficient to shield him from calumny and suspicion : I hope
it is not so bad in your country, and that candid difcuflions
will establish right id**asâindeed it seems peculiarly eflential to
your general and permanent welfare, that just sentiments on such
fubjetts ftiould prevail among your people, because your govern
ment, more than any other, is diretted in its movements by the
present public opinion, let that opinion be well or ///-foundedâ
and it cannot be a matter of future indifference what Heps they
shall now take on this ground. I with they may take none but
such as (hall be clearly diÂ£lated by the soundest policyâand I
call that policy found which, propofmg for its objett the most
extensive public good, has justice for its support and truth for its
light. I fufpett every mealure that is defe6hve in these as useless
ar best, and often pernicious. Although I am a native of this
island, yet you well know that ray heart, with its best feelings, is
wholly with youâ your country has become and alresd/
* See Ns. 210 of this Gazette.Ny pe> r.nal happincfs is interwoven with the utiof the American
?u * hence it iÂ» that I claim indulgence for the solicitude 1
n jiT' '? l" m r ,ef P cftj yoÂ« fWd ast no w'/er than we hav
idted here, or Ufs wifely than you might.
Since I Jett the United S-atson this viflt it has given m<
pain to recollect the surprising facility with which you udi.pt a/.
our faihi'ins, mojt of our cuÃoms, and font el our word opinion!
and prejudicesâprejudices which in certain afpefts are futopoftc.
to be ult tul here, but which in cv. ry view of them must be injuri
ous among you. I wl (h you wou | d nn â c of our viccs or
errors to bt naturalized, but be faiisficd that those which are
pioperly your own will be more than enough. Undoubtedly
you ought to profi by our experienceâbut is this to be done only
by an jndilciiminate imitation of us? Does nothing depend on
circumstances ? Nothing on local situation and relation to other
otates On extent of territory and population ?On the manners,
habits, character and occupations of the people ? Instead of no
ting depending on these circumstances, does not the good or
ill policy of public measures depend principally on them ? And
Â»ls not 85 important, and at the fame time as difficult, for
you to know what to avoid in our conduct, as what to imitate ? 1
hink you will admit that it is.
'! The astonishing increase of wealth and power of the British
nation, within the last 200 years, cannot be contemplated without
suggesting an enquiry into the origin of this prosperity. To enu
merate the causes which incidentally have contributed to the mass,
â would far exceed the bounds of my letter, even if I had the ca
pacity to do it; but I take it to be certain that tnglilhrnen are in
debted principally if not solely to the comparative exccllence of
their government, as the primary and substantial cause of theirJu
ferior opulence.âThis has given them advantages over other na
tion} that no other advantages on their fide could counterbalance.
In this country the people produce, consume and enjoy more than
other Europeansâbecause here persons and property are always
more fafe : here the weak and the poor are defended by the laws
against the rapacity and oppreflion, not of the rich and powerful
only, bat even of their rulers themselves.*
" An unreserved and habitual confidence in the individuals
â¦' that they (hall be completely protested in the free exercise of
their talents, and that the fruits of their honest labors will be
perfectly secure to them," is all that seems necessary to give full
scope to their utmost powers :âthis is fufficient to enable them
to an naturallyâmi in doing this they will ast well for society ;
for it is evident that the Parent of our race, with infinite kindl
ness as well as wisdom, has implanted in our nature a principle
â which, while it stimulates the individual to the most ufeful in
dustry and the (everest exertions for the particular good of him
felf, provides also by this very operation for the general good of
the speciesâthe good of the community or state. This provident,
this guardian principle, uniform as inftinft in the end it proposes'
but varying its means aicoriing to the voants of others, does more
toward the subsistence and comfort of everv society than the
â wisdom of the witeft governments of earth can even comprehend
flill less accomplish. Ought we not to be cautious then how we
touch with rude hands this exquisite part of the original design ?
for my own part, I know of no better way to judge of the Gene
ral merits of public regulations and laws than by their tendency
to strengthen the natural ties of public and private good. With
out a conftar.t refoorce tothiÂ» in social arrangements, there will
often be an incompatibility, where there ought to be a coinci
dence of interestsâthere will be a disappointment of the public
and private hopes, in cases where the true objects of both might
have been well attained.
"I make no apology for giving you these desultory reflf flions
jujl as they arise in mind, because I presume not to inftruft you
but only at provoking you to examins for yourfelf a little more
minutely the theory of commerce and the progress of wealth.
Such a study must furnifh many valuable- lessonsâit will teach
you that the accumulation of property in almost every nation has
been in an exa& ratio to the freedom and security of the citizens
in acquiring and enjoying itâthat as these advantages have been
unequally distributed, fc have their natural effects been produced
â with a proportionate inequalityâit will teach you that in the bed
governed couutries the legislators have seldom been willing to
trust the furc and beneficent operations of nature in the mod
fimplc cases, but like officious midwives have prefered their own
skill, and thus have frequently injured and fomelimes destroyed
both the parent and the offspring. In your researches you will
discover in the policy of ouranceftors much to admire and not a
little to condemn. You will join with those who celebrate our
Navigajion Ast as an txcclUnt fuppsrt of natal power, and in this
lefpeft you can hardly give it fufficient praiseâbut you will per
ceive also, that its true merits are totally mifundeiftood by those
â¢who consider it in any other view as favorable to the landed or
manufaÂ£turing interests, or look to it as a fonrce of pecuniary
gain to the nation : -On the contrary, you will be convinced that
although it has extended our navigation, yet it has operated as a
heavy tax upon trade and industryâwhich however has been
cheerfully borne, because ejential to the national defence. That
mod of our lawgivers, as well as some of our ablest writers have
not supposed it to be favorable to commerce or beneficial 'to the
People in any other refpefls, may be inferred from the motives
and circumstances which have occasioned the forming this extra
ordinary law. After the flight provisions maie in the time of
Richard I Id. you will find the firft regulations of sea-carriage
â were in the time of Elizabeth, and that these were made expre/f
---ly with a deflgn to" increase and maintain the navy;" that about
90 years afterward, in the time of Cromwell, the more sxtenfive
outlines of the plan were drawn " partly from a jia/oufy of the
Dutch, and partly to punijh the Colonijls in the Sugar Islands who
lided with King Charles ;"andtho you will discover that the Re
storation Parliament in filling up the outlines have attempted to
combine other purposes with the original intention, yet you will
fee that ihzfrfi oijeff has been the only one attained, and that the
expectation of aiding commerce by such preposterous means has
been, as it always will be, disappointed; yon will discern that
the English, with all their success, have acquired less than they
might have done-and that by grasping at shadows they have
sometimes loft the substance; that by systems of exclusion and
monopoly, they have raised prices artificially above their natural
level to the prejudice of the comfumers and loss of the trade to
the nation ; you will be convinced that " cheapness in a fair com
petition is the befl Cecurity of any b'anch of trade," and that in
some cases it is the" only one ! and you will find that the Bri
ti!h Government by defpiftng this maxim have in fact loft some va
luable parts of trade which, if they had ,efp e Â£led it, they m i e ht
have retained A review of the effefls of her system will p.ove
to you that it has occasioned to Great-Britain the final loss of
nearly all the carrying trade flie once enjoyed within the Medi
terranean and Archipelago, and on the Atlantic coasts of Europe
and that in reality she has now remaining very little carrying
trade, except what ts properly her own.

Cease, Ell a, cease thy 'witching Song,

You may take this as a certainty, gentlemen that
the public can never have a firm existence u'nleft

some loss about the admitting- attornies. It is
neceflary, I suppose, they should all obtain new

the mode. I would remind you of the necessity
of confining the attornies to special pleadings.
It will be your duty, gentlemen, to communicate
to the people at large, the principles of our new
mode of government, as far as they have, or
shall come to your own knowledge. Any person
who attempts to counteract so valuable an insti

him, and the feverell censure from the people.

MONSIEUR Mirabeau lias declared his inten
tion of producing an answer to Mr. Burke's
celebrated pamphlet. It will be, at least, a work
of eloquence, and may prove what is proverbially
denominated, lightning before death.
Madame delaMotte's return to Paris forebodes
no good She has been several times in the com
pany of Mirabeau. Some fay, she was sent for
thither by M. Orleans, in order to depreciate the
Queen of France's character on the famous neck
lace bufinels, and to fix that tianfadtion wholly
on her Majesty. For this purpose, she has pro

The Theatres at Naples and Milan are said tebe the two largest in the world ; but that at Bo

Theatres are uifulated. Surely tliey ought to be
so in such a metropolis as this ; where fires are
fo'frequent, and so fatal, the doors should open

It does not appear that a Grand Seignior ever
takes warning from the fate of so many of his

in all probability, terminate in some miserable

A military government, like that of the Turks,
tends to despotism, and in every despotic govern

too, more lovely than the morning in her blulhes, move modest
than the rifled 1 illy, when weeping in her dews. Pride of the

to kiss thee, and the heath reserves its bloom togreet thee with its
odour.
Thy lover will pick the strawberries from the lofty cragg, and

THE lower class of mankind are generally in
jured by being deprived of the means of educa
tion, and then insulted for not being intelligent
and orderly. But it is time to correct our ideas
concerning government. Good government is
not bed supported by ignorant people. In Eu
rope the maxim has been to corrupt the enlight
ened few, in order to enslave the ignorant many;
but were the mass of the people enlightened, it
would be impoflible to corrupt them, they would
then be what the Englilh nobility are said now
to be, and what the enlightened of these States
really are, the guardians of their respective State
constitutions. A State which has 30,000 inha
bitants, and among thofeinhabitants but one per
son fit fora judge in a court of subordinate juris
diction, as has been said of the itate of Delphos
in the Peuinfula of Cambria.âls such a itate pro
perly a republic ?âln a republican government
we are told the supreme power derives from the
people.âBut what fort of power will that be,
which flows from an ignorant people. The facft
is, the power does not flow from such ignorant
people, the enlightened and wealthy few alone
19
written by a gentleman in Lon-
pofiefs the power, as is evident from the history
of Delphos, where it is said, that at an election,
the niafs of people, are so ignorant, that they ne
ver consider who is a proper person to make or
abrogate laws, but uniformly, vote for the rich
elt man in the diitriift to represent them, and they
are represented accordingly.

Oil the fubjeÂ£t of the
COD AND WHALE FISHERIES,
[con T I N V EU.I
IN 1771, the Americans had one hundred and
eighty-three vellels, of thirteen thousand eight
liundi ed and twenty tons, in the northern fiih
ery, and one hundred and twenty-one vellels,
of fourteen thoufaiul and twenty tons, in the
louthern, navigated by four thouland and fifty
nine men. At the beginning of the late war,
they had one hundred and leventy-feven vellels
in the northern, and one hundred and thirty
two in tlie fotuliern fiftiery.
Ac that period, our fiihery being suspended,
the Engli/h seized the opportunity of pufliing
theirs. They gave additional bounties of five
hundred, four hundred, three hundred, two
hundred, one hundred pounds ftetling, annual
ly, to the five ships, whicii Ihould take the great
est quantity of oil. The effect of which was
such, as, by the year 1786, to double the quan
tity of common oil necellary for their own con
funiption. Finding, 011 a review of the fubjetf,
at that time, that their bounties had cost the go
vernment thirteen pounds ten (hillings sterling
a man annually, or sixty percent, on the cargoes,
a part of which went coni'equently to ease the
purchases of this article made by foreign nations,
they reduced the northern bonnty from forty to
thirty (hillings the ton of admeasurement.
They had some little time before turned their
attention to thefoiuhern fiihery, had given very
great bounties in it, and had invited the fifhermen
of the United States, to condutfl their enterpri
zes. Under their guidance, and with such en
couragement, this fiihery, which had only beo-un
them in 1 784 or 1785, was rising into rafue.
In 1788, they increased their bounties, and the
temptations to our fiftiermen, under the general
description ofJoreigners who had been employed in
the lubale-fifliery, to pass over with their families
and veflels to the Briti(h dominions either in A
merica or Europe, but preferably to the latter.â
The effetfl of these measures had been prepared
by our whale oils becoming fubjeifi, in their mar
ket, to the foreign duty of eighteen pounds five
/hillings sterling the ton, which, being more than
equal to the price of the common oil, operated
as a prohibition on that, and gave to their own
fpermacsti oil a preference over ours to that a
mount. The particulars of this history are pre
sented to the eye, more in detail, in the table
No. 7.
The fifhermen of the United States, left with
out resource by the loss of their market, began
to think of accepting the British invitation, and
of removingâsome to Nova-Scotia, preferring
lmaller advantages in the neighbourhood of their
ancient country and friends, others to Great-Bri
tain, postponing country and friends to high
premiums.
The government of France could not be inat
tentive to these proceedings. They saw the dan
ger of letting four or five thousand feainen, of the
best in the world, be transferred to the marine
itrengtli of another nation, and carry over with
them an art, which poHeffed almost exclusive-
To give time for a counter plan, the Mar
quiMtlela Fayette, the valuable friend and citi
zen of this, as well as that country, wrote to a
gentleman in Boston to difi'uade the fifhermen from
accepting the British proposals, and to afl'ure them
that their friends in France would endeavor to do
something for them. A veflel was then arrived
from Halifax, at Nantucket, to take off those who
had proposed to remove. Two families had gone
a board, and others were going. In this moment,
the letter arriving, suspended their designs. Not
another went aboard, and the veflel returned to
Halifax with only the two families.
The plan adopted by the French miniftrv, very
different from that of the firft mover, was to give
a counter invitation to the Nantucket men to re
move and fettle in Dunkirk, offering them a boun
ty of fifty livres (between nine and ten dollars)
a ton on the admeasurement of the veflels thev
ihould equip for the whale filhery, vvithfome other
advantages. Nine families only, of thirty three
persons, accepted this invitation. This was in
178 J. In 1786, the ministry were led to fee, that
their invitation would produce but little efFetft,
and that the true means of preventing the emi
gration of our fifhermen to the British dominions,
would be to enable them ltill to follow their call
ing from their native country, by giving them a
Jiew market for their oils, initead of the old one
they had loft. The duties were, therefore, aba
ted 011 American whale oil immediately, and a
further abatement promised by the letter N. 8
and in December, 1787, the arret, No. 9, was
patted. To be continued.

The bridges are to beconftrufcted on the principlesof thofeereft
ed over Charles, Myftick, and Beverly Rivers in the State of Mas
sachusetts, with a draw to admit a free paflage for veilels with fix
ed standing masts, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as shall be determined most con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks on
each fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid veflels in pa fling through. Also, one lamp on cach fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to fun rife, during
the continuance of the lease.
The bridges aie to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as (hall render them perfectly substantial and secure in
the opinion of the commifiioners, and are to be of a futficient
height to protest them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for cairiagc way, 20 feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on cach fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet.
Do. for balluftrades, 1 foot each, 2 feet.
Do. for hand-rails foi do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal. 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluitrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Boston and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept in constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be Surrendered in good ordcrj
agreeably to the aÂ£t.
The following are the terms which the commifiioners are au
thorised to offer to contractors :
A lease of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the pre
ient rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an estimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
aflual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last part,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that lum will conlcquently produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per ann. This may fairly be
estimated as the fmalleit profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing intcr
courfe between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftruflion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-Yoik, on the weflern fide of the Hudson, are all important
circumstances, which must neceflarily tend rapidly to accumulatc
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads connected
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpoie.
As loon as the places (hall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the contra&s for eie&ing them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contra# on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to Wil li am Maxwell,
Esq. in New-York, fpecifying the shortest period of lease for
which they will undertake to erefl the said bridges,together witb
proper security for performing the fame.
