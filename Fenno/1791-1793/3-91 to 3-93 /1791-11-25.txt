Copy of a Utter from a gentleman in New- Jersey, to his friend in the
Legijlatuie of that State, now fitting at Trenton.
Middlesex County, Nov. 10, 1791.
S I R,
I RECEIVED your letter dateo the 4th infant, and am to ac
knowledge the favor you did me in vour candid relation of the
demands of the gentlemen who mean to establish manufa&orics
in this State, and as I know vou wish to he informed of the sen
t ments of some of your condiments, I think it a duty I owe to
my fellow-citizcns, to give von my opinion on these matters, re
c red by them to our Legflature, and I will endeavor to give it
in the bell manner my time and fmalJ abilities will admit, being
confeious they are far from to the fuhjeft which I
trufl will be clearly and honrftiy d.fcufled by the superior genius
of the gentlemen of our Legiflai " r e.
Charters are generally reft rifted in England and in this coun
try, binding the incorporate bodies to certain fpecified articlesâ
but if theie gentlemeo have it in their ootion, generally to profe
cu e any mechanical business they think proper, they will bear
down by their large fcapital, all the mechanical branches of the
fame species in the United States ; this in time will have a very fa
tal effefl on the revenues of the public ; as the mechanics arc at
present a very valuable and large part of the community, and
raise large sums in the imp#ftand government taxes, which, when
237
[Whole No. 268.]
they are crushed, mud fall on the landed interest : But Ift u? turn
our eyes 10 the kingdom of France, and we will fee the mod en
lightened philosopHers, statesmen and patriots, perhaps that ever
gÂ»aced the universe, who are truly the guardians of the rights of
-man : That by their united study for more than two years, have,
by their conflitution, utterly and forever ab'oli(bed all incorporate
bodies wbatfoever, as being injurious to the public -weal.
Lottery, is a fpecics of gaining that wife men have written a
gainst and hi;ve laid it down, as having a fatal tendency on the
morals ol the community, and that they fhoula not be granted,
but on the greatest emergencies to the public at large. It locks up
for a time the circulating cash, stagnates trade, prevents just debtÂ«
being paid, and is hurtful to the families of the poor adventurers.
That cutting Canals, to facilitate navigation, is a most noble
invention and ought to be prosecuted wherever there is a profpeÂ£fc
of its answering the end of cheapening tranfpoi tation ; but if any
such matter is contemplated, why should it not be the property ot
the United States, or of the State of New-Jersey ? to which those
gentlemen apply for unbounded right to cut canals where they
plcafe. Suppose they were empowered to cut a canal from Sand
pink to the head of South river or to the Millstone, and open aw
inland navigation irom Philadelphia to New-York, which is
thought praÂ£ticable ; would not this destroy hundreds of acres or
good meadow on the Sandpink?by cutting a canal of twenty
feet wide for miles together, would it not ruin many ot our
worthy fellow-citizens without proper compensation ? Itscourfe
might necelfarily go irom therethrough leveral good farms,orch
ards, gardens, &c. ai/d all this to be under the fanftion of a law,
made for the purpose of individuals, who want to aggrandize their
posterity by a perpetual 1011, and after this State had granted them a
lottery to raise thirty ttklufand pounds on the public. Thu iv
queft really appears to m: laughable, as they tnuft fiippote our
Legislative body to be extremely goodnatured.
Suppose their (lock to be a million and a half of dollar-:, which
I have been informed, by the rapid and large subscriptions it is
likely to amount to, which by their requeil may be uf-d in any
lucrative branch of manufactory if they are not restriCted : This
sum is perhaps greater tlian the united capital At all the mechanics
in America, which, by being divided into many thoutands 'of
small funis, in the hands of honcft, industrious men, for ihe -
fifience of their families, enables them so pay their taxes cheerfully
and consume great quantities of dutiable articles ; but thrfe gen
tlemen come forward with their abrogate itock and mode Illy ask.
an exemption from all taxes. O heaven ! can the human mind
be so blinded and callous through avarice !
Many of the mechanics fuffered great loflfes in the late war, paid
heavy taxes and served faithfully in the militia, and have been
obliged, through, neceflity, to fell their hard earned certificates for
half a crown in the pound, to some of the very men who now
come forward with them at mote than twenty shillings. Among
these I would include the brave continental soldier, who is now
returned to his tiade for a scanty subsistence. I would ask why
they fuffered every species of misery to eftabiifh the present go
vernment, but to eujoy an equal fhsre of its privileges and immu
nities with their fellow citizens, which they will not do, if at any
time a part of the community are exempted from taxes, in the
fame branches of manufactory they follow and they are taxed.
If such a law should be made in any S:ate, I think it would have
a tendency to shake the pillar thereof to its centre.
I wish not Sir, to be understood that I am against reasonable
encouragement being given to the company : I think under pro
per restraint they may be very ufeful to the community in general
and ought to be encouraged, as iar as reason and good policy
may admit. _______________ CLIT US.

MR. I'EKNO,
Obferv'tng in your paper Â«f Nov. 2, a fpcculatiott
signed Respondent, pertnit a fubferibtr also to as
sume a logical ftgnature ; and iudttlge him in inâ¢'
prting the following observations of an Opponent.
I DO not mean from time to time, to oppose the
Respondent, or perhaps ever again to take
notice of his remarks ; but at. this time, am forci
bly imprefled with the impropriety of his infer
ences. The Respondent takes notice of a para
graph publiflied in your Gazettee of the 2d inft,
wherein the general happiness difFufed over the
face of the country, is ascribed to the goodnefi
of our constitution, and the laws of the United
States ; and supposes that the happiness alluded
to, is the pleating appearance which the face of
the country a Humes. He then aflerts, that " du
ring the lad summer the face of the country,
through a considerable part of it,did wear a molt
dismal, diftrefling, and doleful countenance
and then draws this conclufiog, that the consti
tution or laws inuft have fume difinal defe<ft, up
on a fuppolition that his major is true.âHis ma
jor I grant is trfle, (/. f.) that " those plea/ing
appearances" constitute parr of the happiness re
fnlting from our emiftitution and lawsâAs to his
minor, if by a considerable portion of the coun
try, he means the greatest part, it is falfe ; but
if he means but a finall part, which indeed would
be considerable, it may be true ; but let him
mean which he will, his conclusion is falfc.â
I have been led thus far to take notice ofhis re
marks fyllogiftirally, both from their form and
his signature as well as my own.âlt mult recur
imn-ediatelj to every person in the lealt ac
quainted with rhe hiflorical, as well as political
and agricultural (late of different nations, that
the happiness of the people, theflourifhingftate,
the pleasing appearance and the fruitful produc
tions of the country, abundantly depend upon
the liberty of the inhabitants and the wholefome
nefs of the lawsâHow many countries are there
--- â¢ *under despotic governments, whose foil in irfelf
is the most fertile imaginable, that scarcely pro
duce subsistence for the inhabitants, and jntirely
owing to the badness of the governments âWhere
there is no security for property, none are am
bitious of acqoiring it ; the accumulation there
of, is but an inducement to their tyrants to de
prive them even of their lives, in order to pofl'efs
their property âUnder ihefe circumstances men
are desirous of procuring only so much as ftiall
be barely fufficient for their sustenanceâThe
consequence is plain, the agricultural interelt
fuffers, the ground not half tilled, and the coun
try wearing a miserable appearanceâOn the con
trary, where the citizen enjoys liberty and secu
rity for his property, he is desirous of increasing
it, and makes the belt use of his lands ; the coun
try puts on " a gay, pleasant and prosperous ap
pearance," and that in gradation from a tyran
nical government to a free one, in pr oportion to
the goodness of the constitution. These effeds
of our excellent constitution are visible to every
obftTvtr, and acknowledged by every friend to
the government âAll who acknowledge a divine
Providence, inuft own to be the prime source
of both profperltyand adverlity ; and sometimes,
for wife purposes, it is exercised in adverse dis
pensations ; thus we fee partial evil in the midst
of general good, without destroying the univer
sal influence of second causesâSuch may have
been the cafe during the lall fuinmerâln the
course of Providence a drought prevailed infome
places, yet notwithstanding, there was a general
appearance of fertility in the country âthough
graft failed in lome places, yet was there a plen

againfi the benign influence of our government,
in its happy effeds upon the country at large,
nor lead to a conclusion that the government is
defective. lam at the fame riine sorry to find

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, November 14,1791.
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
Debate on the Ratio oj Reprefentntivn.
TVT 1 *- UNDLEY declared himfelf to be in fa
vor of one representative for every 30,000
persons,
The opinion of the people, he said, should be
the guide of the committee : that opinion, he
conceived to be in favor of the ratio he had men
tioned.
The representation ought as nearly as possible
to ex pre Is not only the will, but to participate
111 the Tvifhes and interests of the peopleâA large
representation embraces these interests more ful
ly, and is more competent to gi v "ing and receiv
ing information. The objects of legiflatioii are
fach as come home to the doors, to the feelings
ol every man ; the government ought therefore
to secure the confidence of the people by a larcre
representation. The expence he considered "s
trifling compared to the benefitsâand the people
expec't and are willing to pay for being well go
veined, and having their liberties secured. An
encreafed representation, he considered as an
additional security against corruption. As to
delays occasioned by a numerous bodyâhe ob
served. that the representatives were chosen to
deliberate, and to mature every fubjeiTt before
oecilion He inllauced the advantages derived
trom the numerous representations in France and
in Ireland The former had fraoied aconftituti
on in two years for twenty-fix millions of citi
zens, and provided for securing the liberties of
Jvp nui ;yâand the latter had proved a fuc
ce s, u L.airier against the encroachments of the
arbKrary power of England. He concluded, by
a ertnig that the voice of the people was in fa
vor of the amendment proposed to the conftitu
-10.., Viiich would give une representative to eve-
T y 3Â°>ooo persons.
Mr. Giles -This fubjeft, said he, has struck
me in two points of viewâWhether Congress
are not preceded from exercising any discretion
on the fubjeA â¢ and whether, if they are not. it
is expedient for them to exercise this discretion
at this time. The ratio of representation is a
conltitutxonal, and not a legifiaiive adt. He re-
AÂ°n l u* C Â° ,,(V " mion ' in Nvllich is said that
L/l n Â°r re P re, " entat ive to every state,
and secondly, that until the enumeration, the
AN OPPONENT
nnmber flionld be as therein appointed to each
(lateâafter the enumeration the numbqr is men
tioned, below which it (hall not be placedâbut
there is a negative power to increase the ratioâ
and from this negative power, a positive discreti
onary power is inferred. But, he observed, than
"Congref* had precluded itfelf from a right to
exercise this discretionary power, by fending out
to the several date legislatures, an amendment
on this very fubjeclâthis amendment lie consi
dered in a ferions point of view ; and had this
idea been attended 10 at the commencement of
the discussion, he conceived that it would have
prevented the opinioYi from being brought for
ward, whether it was expedient that any change
in the ratio of the representation (hould take
placeâThe idea of one to 30,000, he tonfidered
as fully fetijed in the minds of the people ; and
a change 011 the part of the government, would
indicate a changeable disposition, and a 111 utabiii
ty of counsels, which is but another name for
weakness.
The sense of the people have been retorted to
by gentlemen on both fides ofthequeftionâthis,
if it can be ascertained, is undoubtedly the belt
guide ; and he thought thole in favor of one to
30,000 had with great propriety referred to the
conventions, and to the adls of Congress itfelf.
But the amendments are said to have been a
matter of compromise, and were insincerely ac
ceded to by the majorityâbut even 011 this ground
he conceived, that the sense of the people was
equally at well declared.âHe however differed
from gentlemen in refpeift to the motives wlych
produced ihofe amendmentsâin the ftate'he came
from, both federalifts and anti-federalifts were
fully of opinion that.further fecurhy as to the
representation, wasrequifite.
The numerous representations of the states,
whatever inconveniences may attend them, plain
ly shew the sense of the people on the fubjeA.
He then took a view of the objccls of Icgifla
tion to the state afterablies, and of those of the
general government âin the former, he said, a
bove ioooperfons are employed, though their
attention is confined to their internal policeâ
Those of the general government on the other
band, are on the great objects of the whole fi
nance of the Union, a sum of more than eighty
millions of dollars, &c. &c.
It is said that we shall want abilitiesâbut, said
he, I fhonld be sorry if a reprefenration of ten
times the present number of this House, fliould
comprize the abilities of a single state.
He afligned different causes from numbers, for
the corruption in*tlie British House of" Commons
âamong these wtfre the frequent mortgages of
the funds, and the iiijmenie appropriations at
the difftofal of the executiveâthe mode of their
elections, &c. A large number, he observed, is
not so easily corrupted as a small body.
An inequality of circumstances, he then observ
ed, produces revolutions in government, from
democracy to aristocracy and monarchy. Great
wealth produces a desire ofdiftintftions, rank and
titlesâThe revolutions in property in this coun
try, have created a prodigious inequality of cir
cuniftancesâGovernment has contributed to this
inequalityâthe Bank of the United States is a
most important machine in promoting the objects
of this monied imereftâthis bank will be the
most powerful engine to corrupt this Houseâ
some of the members are direiftors of this inflitu
tionâand it will only be by increafingthe repre
sentation that an adequate barrier can be oppos
ed to this monied interert. He next adverted to
certain ideas -Which he said had been difl'eminated
through the United States ; and here he took
occasion to observe, that the legislature ought to
express some public disapprobation of these opi
nionsâThe strong executive ef this government
ought to be balanced by a full reprefentatioH in
this House. He hoped the motion to strike out
30,00# would not obtain.
Mr. BoudinÂ»t closed the debate of this day, by
a few remarks, reinforcing his former obfervaci
ons in favor of an increased ratio.
TUESDAY, November 15
Mr. Page.âl can 110 longer refrain from ex
pressing my sentiments refpecling the queltion
before the committee ; not only because \ wifhif
paifibie to remove the error which I think seve
ral members, tor whom I have the highest respect,
have fallen into, but because I feel Inyfelf more
interested in the question than 1 ever was in any
one I have had to decide on.
Sir, it gave me pain to find those worthy mem
bers calculating and coldly applying the rules of
arithmetic to a lubjedt beyond the power of num
bers to express the degree of its importance to
their fellow-citizens. I was distressed, fir, to find
that in their honelt zeal for securing order, dis
patch of btifinefs, and dignity in refpetftability of
members in the general legislature, they ufed'ar
guments which have been applied in other coun
tries to the eftablifoment of insolent aristocracies
âin some, tyrannical despotisms- and in others,
Kings ; thole countries which were :noll on their
guard with the semblance of a free government
238
Sir,the errors I wifli to correct are these â T !
think that because it is propoftd, by a 1
mendmenc to the Constitution, to authorise th
to interfere in the business of afcertainine
fixing the ratio of reprefesmation to the po PU |' â 
tion of the States, that Congress ought, with o '
any hefuation, to enter on that bufniefÂ»_butl
humbly conceive, that Coogreft, as this is a deli
cate quellion in which their own weight and
portane'e must nnire wjth the weight aiid fab'u"'
Â£ ial intereil or their coulhtucnts, ought to
to the suggestions of delicacy, and feave its jjf
cuffion to a difintereffed convention of the States"
I fay it appears to me no firrall error to q jip tl ,Â®*
plain path of legislation, marked out for us bv
the Coiiil itution, needlessly io wander into the
field of political '(peculation, its
poled defects. 3 *
Let nie therefore advise to leave the reftrk<ii on
of the numbers of members of tbn house to the
people, or to some future Cou'grefs, which carr
fee more plainly than can now be descried the
evils of a too numerous reprefenration.''
to doing, we (hall avoid, if not an inipropermea-
Cure, ar lead a rafli stepâat least we (hall Hand
clear of a charge of indelicacy, and deprive our
enemies of the triumph they expected in the com
pletion of their predictions, thatCongrefs would
never propose any amendments to the Constitu
tion but such as would be subservient to their own
views and aggrandizement. Let us not give the
enemies of our new government cause to exult
and its friends to sigh and mourn. Let us not
give our friends occasion to repeat what many
have said, that so many of our citizens have been
led away by theoretical writers on government
as to render it problematical whether the Ame
rican States are not at this time as much indebted
to the Na'tionnl Aflembly for its remains of re
publican principles, as France was to Cotigrefsin
t 776, for their firfl. ideas of that liberty which
they now enjoy. Let us not, in this moment of
general exultation of the friends to the rights of
man, take a step which may damp their joy, and
lead them to fear that Americans who were fore
molt in the glorious career of liberty, have Hoo
ped (hort.
But, fir, granting that ws were now fitting in
full toDventiou, convened for the sole pii'rpofe of
.altering that article of theConlhtation which re :
fpeefts die number of representatives, woulditi.oc
become us :o consider rather what was the sense
of the members who framed that Conflitution,
and what was and is the sense of their constituents
and our own respecting ir, than what may be the
r'efult of our enquiries concerning the speculative
opinions of writers on the fubjedt of government,
or even the real consequences of the mot' piauli
ble theories reduced to pradtice in other eoutries
Hut not to take up the precious time of this
house with relations of faifts to' show what was
and is the opinion of our fellow-citizens 011 this
interelting fubjecft, 1 will only state a few
arguments which have weight with me as be
ing in themfeives evident truths, viz. Our
Conftiturion being framed by the people, and
introduced to us in their name, and Congress
being the creatures of their will, fpoker. into ex
igence by the word of theirpower for Congress,
to lefl'en their weight, to diminilh their import
ance, and to exclude them from as full a/hareiu
their own government, as can be confident with
the nature of it, and indeed from that fliare which
they claim, inujt be impolitic and dangerous.
But granting that the people wished not a
greater fliare in the general government than is
proposed by the amendment, as it is impolfible,
a country like the United States, tliar one mail
can be fufficiently informed of the opinions,
wishes and'real interests of thirty-five thoufandof
his fellow-citizens, and therefore laws might be
enaifted contrary to the opinions, wishes and in
terests of the people, in which they might never
theless acquiesce, facrincing their interests for
the fake of peace and quiet, to the wills of their
reprefjntatives, one thirty-five thousandth part
of their own numberâWhat friend to his coun
try would wish to fee such a dangerous influence
on the one hand, and such a blind fubmiflion on
the otlier ? How long could an enlightened peo
ple remain in such a state of infenfibifity and
torpor ! and what might not be the consequence
of their awaking from their lethargy ? If not an
expensive revolution, an expensive repeal of laws.
And here I will remark, that the fm3lleft number
of legiflators,and they too, well feleJted for their
wisdom and respectability, if unacquainted with
their conftittients, might pass well framed laws,
founded on the wifdowÂ»f other countries, and
yet find them disagreeable to their constituents,
and be under a necessity of repealing them âbut
this could not be the cafe if the people had in
that legislature a fufficient number of represen
tatives, on whose fidelity, attachment and difiii
tereftednefs, they could rely. This, fir, is a truth
worthy of our attentionâan ignorance of which
or inattention thereto, 1 fufpeit has been the oc
cafion of much political evil in the world. Hap
pily for France, the people had such a number ot
repi efentatives in the National A Hem bly, as couldtheir feeling, inform their judgment, as-
Jfcfrtheir interest, and eftablilh their confidence
'their fidelity and difiiuereftednefsâhad that
Moniber been much smaller, it is probable Frairce
would never have been delivered from opprelfion
bv their exertions.
I believe the National Aflembly have judged
bout 7)0 members fufficient to represent their
pje which on a supposition that they amount
even to 26 millions, will be 1 representative for
every 34,0c0 ; a larger representation than is
posed by the amendment before us ; but, fir, it
is not and cannot be the interest or wifli of the
pepnle at large to have a fin all representation in
Cimgrefs under the prtfent' government. We
are told however that to avoid expence the peo
ule wifli it and that to avoid confufion in this
house we should comply with that wilh. With
refpecl to the article of expence, I think we may
with propriety make use of arithmetical calcula
tions and to (ind how much at 6 dollars per day
paid to 1 representative ic would colt the 30,000
divide 600 cents by 30,000, the number of citi
zclis__and we have r-50 of a cent per diem, the
expense of each citizen, if to be equally divided,
amoiiffft themâthat is 1 cent for every 50 citi
zens pr. diem, or which must be the fame thing
r cent must be paid by each citizen for every 50
days Session of their representative in Congreis ;
Sir 1 have the consolation to find that if our con
ftit'ution had I representative for every IJ, in
stead of 50,000 they could well afford to pay
thein, and that ifit were even more expenllve as
to the payment of members, yet the people would
nioft certainly be better Satisfied with the laws
whicb they would then have so great a (hare in
framing. The people fee that if their interests
are not well guarded by a fufficient n umber of
tbeir fellow-citizens, who have a fellow-feeling,
a common interest, they may be Sacrificed to the
ambition of Some, or the vanity of others ; 1 trull
fir, that they know too well the high'price they
have paid for the purchase of their liberties, to
be unwilling to pay a few farthings for the only
poflible means of preserving them. They fee
rioTjv that the monarchical and ariltocratical part
of government is to be restrainedâthe former
from absolute tyranny, and the latter from an
â¢ jnfufferable insolence, by a very numerous body
of the representatives of the people alone. 'Ame
ricans know, fir, that monarchical governments
were neceflary for the protecftion of weak ig
noraflt people, againll the encroachments of am-'
Mtipus and ferocjgns .andl for the
preservation of order amongftgt life m Serves.: tljat
an ariltocratical became convenient tcrspro
tet'i them against tlie fpvittg-
of monarchy"-âthat this form was
adapted to a Small progress if) the Science of go
vernment, and that theSe two forms properly
checked and rontrouled by the democrmical
form, is Hill better Suited to a general know
ledge of that Science ; that a representative go
yernmejit Such as their own is, every part of
which is more or less pervaded by the Spirit of
representation, cannot by any other means be so
perfedHy fectned, as by their having at least as
full a share as they have claimed in the demo
cratiaal branch of their government.
1 know. Sir, that many friends of ourconftitu
tion, thought that the Convention did not pay a
fufficient attention to the imereils of their con
iiituents, when they retrained them from hav
ing more than one representative for every 50,000
citizens.âl know that there is a report that the
people are indebted to their President, even for
this (hare in their government ; and 1 believe,
Sir, if this report be true, that whatever has been
fojuftly Said of him, as compared to Fabius, to
Hannibal, to Alexander, may be forgotten, when
this instance of his wisdom, difintereftetlnefs,and
attachment to'the interests of his fellow citizens,
will be more and inoreknown and applauded,and
befo reverengraved on the hearts of thejrpoftei ity
âShall we then, Mr. Chairman, the direct repre
sentatives of the people, be less attentive to their
interest, and that too refpec'ting their (hare in
the deliberations of their own of Repre
sentatives, tha-n the President of their Conventi
on was ? I trust nor.
I
1 will not pretend to fay, however, whether
in an afiembly where attempts are frequently
wade, to carry into effect the projects of monar
chical or aristocrat icnl juntos, the virtuous ftrug
gies of patriotic members, may not producemob
like disorders ; but in an afiembly like Congress,
Where 1 fhotild fuppufe no such queltion can be
agitated ; none which may not be difcuflcd with
temper and decency, such disorder need not be
a pprehended. 1 ihould fuppufe there would be
'els danger of aniinolhies and difordeily debates
,n Congress, amongst 1200 members, thaji in the
Britifli Parliament, if it consisted but of 100. â
V/ here we have all but one and the fame g:eat
in view, the bappinefs of our country,
(not the interests of a particular body of men,
"orn with privileges infuhing the feelings and
tMe rights of fieemen, nor the whims of an indi
10ua 1, horn to trample on his fallow creatures)
* e can have 110 cause to be diflatisficd with one
another.
Suiely, Sir, uulefs these gentlemen fuppofethe
members of Corigrefs void of sense, or of every
idea or.decency and propriety, they cannot f'ap
pofe thateven joo members would not be easily
reltrained within the bounds of order.
Upon the whole, Sir, I conclude that neither
an apprehension of expence, nor of' disorderly
debates, ought to induce this committee to run
the rilk ot being charged witb indelicacy, if not,
of facrifieingthe interelts of their conlHtuents.
I hope, therefore, that the worthy and ingenious
members who, by supporting the amendment,
have produced a full difcuilion of the' question,
will now join with me, afid' majority, in
voting against it.

I he address from the General Afiembly of St. Domingo, to th]

Mr. Williamfon prefentcd an affidavit refpettjng the loss or del

Carolina, which 4>eing read, it was moved that it rtionld be refer

Mr. Giles observed that the cafe involved two principles, which
lie conceived to'-be of some importance,to be fully difctrfTed and
- decided, previous to an unqualified acceptance of the reportâthe
firft was, whether a member had a right to vacate his own featâ
and the other was, how far it is in the power of the executive of a
particular State, to fill the vacancies which may take place in this
house. These confidcrations, he thought, had essential reference
' to the privileges of members.
Mr. Scncy observed, that he conceived the report was ftri&ly
conformable to the rules and precedents of the house, in similar
casesâseveral of which had occurred. With refpeÂ£t io the right
of a member to resign, he thought the reverse idea involved an at
tack on the privileges of the citizens of the United States. >

Some accounts from England, recently pub
lished, inform that Mr. Burke is becofiie so un
popular, that both his friends and die world are
deserting himâand even the Ministers treat him
with coldness.
I,ate accounts from France fay, that af;er the
firit day of October, 179T, no American ihips la
den with Tobacco were to be admitted to entry
in the .French ports, except condition, of
coming direcftly from America with clearances
for France. See the letter in the last page of

A subscription is to be opened in this city on

The Aristocrats in Paris, it is said, were con
founded ar the King's acceptation of the Consti
tutionâand it is now added, that this event has
thrown a universal damp on the fpiritsof the ex
iles from that kingdom. The latest European
intelligence contains very little information on
the subject of a counter-revolution. The prof
pecfts of the anti-revoludonifls grow fainter and
fainter, as the people grow more and more ha
bituated to the walks or freedom.
The account of the arrival of the Counteft of
Effingham at New-York*, is premature.
A proposal has appeared in the Boston papers for publifhi'ng ia

in our next.
The Hon. George Plat er is eleÂ£led Governor of Maryland.
Thursday last a fire broke out in the house of Mr. Robert
Hodge, bookseller, in New-Yorkâwhich, notwithstanding the
great exertions of the citizens, was nearly consumed. Mr. Hodge's
loss is said to be great. Â«
Two instances of alarms by fire have occurred in this city since
our lastâa small framed house and a {table were destroyed, but
the vigilance of the citizens prevented the flames from fprcuding
any further.
We have the pleasure of announcing to the public, the arrival
of Crigadier-Gcneial Harmar, his lady and family.
A citizen addsâ" It must give peculiar pleasure to every real
friend to the army to be informed, that this worthy officer (whole
services, during the late war as Colonel of a regiment, and since
the peace as Commander in Chief in the Western Territory, can
never be forgotten while gratitude is considered of any worth
amonglt us) has again returned to his native place in good health
and fptrits, where he intends to remain the rnfuing winter. And
although the (hafts of malice have been thrown at him, touching
his conduÂ£t on a late Indian expedition, yet they have wholly
miffed their aimâas the General, after many and repeated solici
tations for a court-martial, at length obtained a trial, and now
(lands acquitted of any and every charge allcdged against him,
with the highefl honor to himfelf and enure fatisfaÂ£tiou to hu
countrv."
When Congress adopted the State debts, and put them on the
fame footing the Continental Debts, because they were incurred
for similar obje&s, peculiar difficulties induced the necdlity of
confining the assumption within certain limits, which were then
known to be fliort of the a&ual ft ?\e of those debts. The oppo
nents to the measure felt theii opposition diininilhcd, because they
saw the utmost extent of the engagement â its friends acquiesced,
because they knew that the eflablifhment of the principle mull
fina'ly lead to a general assumption. The measure having gene
rally met with a favorable reception from the public, and having
evidently been attcndedVith good effetb, there is no leafon to
anticipate much oppofiiion to the completion' of so bcneficial a
system, inasmuch as the exifling revenues will probably supply an
ample lund for the purpose. The furpluffes of these dcbtj> mail
be very inconsiderable, and it would be inconfiflcnt with that en
lightened policy which has hitherto marked the proceedings of
the national l.cgifhture, to cripple a system which has been so
universally applauded, and by a narrow-minded conduct to in
volve in perpetual confufion the national finances.
