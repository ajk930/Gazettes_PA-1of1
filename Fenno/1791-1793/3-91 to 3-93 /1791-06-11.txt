JVI. JEFFERSON, Minister Plenipotentiary of the
United Stares.
SIR,
AS it is the intention of the King to favor, as much as poflible,
the commerce of the United States, I have the honor to com
municate to you the measures that have been taken on this fubjeft.
Bv a letter of the 9th January, 1784, to the Marquis de la
Fayette, I informed him that instead of two free ports promised
by the treaty with the United States, the King had determined
so them four, which has born done ; and I promised him
that I would dire# my attention to the custom-houses and du
ties which are p' ejudicial to commerce, observing however that this
object demanded long invt {ligations, which are not yet corn
pitted. By another letter I informed him, that his Majesty had
fuppreiTVd the duiies upon the exportation of brandy, and I ex
peÂ£fed t nis fnpo> eflion woul .1 be ufrful to the American com*
merre; I likewise promised him that the duties of the King
and the admiralty, payable by an American ve(T;l on her arrival
in a French port, should be diminish :d and reduced to a (ingle
duty, and regulated according to the number of masts and draught
of water, an . not by the uncertain estimation of measurement.
This reduttion requires a perfect knowledge o* all the duties paid
in our por s ; and as they aie of various kinds, the statements
which I have ordered o be made are not ready.
You know, fir, the King has appointed a committee for the
particular purpose of examining our commer rial connexions with
the United States, and that the Marquis de la F-ivette has pre
sented a conformable to the ide3s contained in your letter
.to the Count deVtgennes; but you will consider how impru
dent it would be to huzard by a change of fvftem, the product of
a branch of revenue which amounts to twenty-eight millions, up
on an article which i noi of thefirft neceflityââ  after a long dif
rufiion of every means'hat can beat present adopted to encourage
the importation of American tobacco, it has been refoNed not to
break the agreement made with Mr. Morris, but that after the
expiration of th's contrast, no similar one shall be made, wd
that in the mean while, the farmers general should be obliged to
purchase, annually, about fifteen thousand hogsheads of Ameri
can tobacco imported directly from the United States, in French
or American vessels at the fame price, on the fame conditions
â which have been stipulated by the contract with Mr. Morris.
You will remember, fir, that before a regulation could be made
in favor of (he importation of whale oil, the Marquis de
Fayette had taken a particular arrangement with Mr. Sangrain for
Ihe tale of this article, to the amount of eight hundred thousand
"Jivrcs, and that I had granted him palfports in ord.r to render
-â¦his firft importation, free from all duties whatsoever. The fame
Mr. Sangrain, afterwards made an agreement with some met
chants of Bollon, to the yearly amount of four hundred thousand
Jivres, to la ft during fix years, for which his Majesty has granted
the fame favors which arc enjoyed by the Hanfe Towns.
This matter having been lately more extensively examined ;
the adminiflration to whom the committee communicated their
wish, agreeable to the Marquis de la Fayette's deman' 1 and your
opinion, entirely to abolish all duties upon oil, have found that
at prefent,they could not consent to it, on account of the engage
ments made with other powers. All that could be done was to
gran', during ten years, to the whale oil, fpermacaeti, and what
ever is comprehended within these denominations, imported from
the United States in French or American vessels, the fame favors,
the fame diminution of duties which ihc Hanfe Towns enjoy.
His Maiefty hopes that the commercial connexions between
the United States and France, will become so considerable as to
engage him to continue the effect of this provisional determina
tion ; and as it has been observed by the committee, that a great
fluty of fabrication has been hitherto piid upon the moll favored
â whale oil, and even upon the national, his Majesty consents to
abolish the duty of fabrication with iefpeft to the whale oil and
fpermacaeri, direttly imported from the United States in French
nr American bottoms, so that this oil and fpermac<cti shall not
JÂ»ay, during ten years, any "ther duty but seven livres ten sols, and
ten sols, perlivre; this last augmentation of ten sols per livre,
shall cease in 1790.
It has also been determined that particular informations be fa
ken concerning the consumption of Carolina nee in France, and
that means be devised to encourage the importation of this ar
ticle.
Representations having been made concerning the considerable
duties laid upon the importation of pot-alh and pearl-afti, also
upon beaver-Huns and hair and raw leather, his Majesty has sup
pressed all duties whatsoever upon thofc articles, if imported of
the growth of the United States in French or American vessels.
He is likewise desirous of encouraging every article of American
fur.
His Majesty has moreover consented to abolish all duties upon
â¼nafts, vards, keels for (hips, red cedar, green oak., and in a word,
rll kinds of wood fit for (hip-building imported from ths United
States in French or American veflels.
The committee having; likewise rep r esented that there wasa du.
Tv of five per cent, on the purchase of foreign built (hips, and thai
this riiitv was prejudicial to the sale of American velfels, his ma
yfly has brrn olrafed to exempt from all dutirs, the purchase o;
ihms which shall be proved to be built in the United States.
Great duties having formerly been laid upon all (hrubs, trees
snd feed, his Majesty has abolished these duties, when the above
articles (hall be imported in French or American veflVls.
It having been represented that the State of Virginia had or-
thr arms for her militia to be made in France, an order is
jÂ»?flcd, that the prohibitions which hitherto have prevented the
importation of arms and gunpowder, as well as the duties laid
r:pon these articles when exported by permiflion, shall be abo
lilhrd; and that whenever the United States shall think it ex
t-'-oirnt to export from France, arms, guns and gunpowder, they
< >all have full permiflion, provided iliefe articles are exported in
Frrnch or American veflels, and they lhall be liable only to a ve-
ry <mall dntv, in order to facilitate the calculation of exports.
Lafily, his Majrftv has received with the fame favor, the appli
cations made tothr Committee for the fuDpreflion of the heavy
duues actually paid upon books and papers of all kiuds : The
PORT
Fontainblcau, OElobcr 22, 1786.
Saturday, June i i, 1791-
King abolilhes all these duties when the above articles shall be
exported to the United States in French or American veilels. "
It is with great pleasure, Sir, that I inform you of the dispo
sitions oi hw-Majelty ; they area new tcftimony of his great de
fireto eftabli (h the most intimate commercial conneflions between
the two nations, and ot the favorable attention he will always pay
to any propoial madein thename of the United States of America.
I have the honor of being, with fmcere attachment,
Si r ,
Your most humble, and
Most obedient servant,
P. S. Your nation will undoubtedly receive with plealure, the
information of the facilities which the King has just granted to the
exportation of the wines <<f Bourdeaux, Guienne, and Touraine,
and the suppression of the duties granted by different arrets ot
Council, of which the Marquis de la Fayette will give you notice.

Joh
to Reviewers.
SALT of the Earth ! Ye stimuli to Fame !
Of rising Genius, kind and bfft Manure !
Ah! can I, can I, without tears, endure
The fad neceflity to name,
And my last, last, adieu, proclaim ?
How doth fad memory, with recurrence vain,
Call up to view past scenes of dear delight ;
Now gone, nay vanifh'd, from my wifhful fight ;
When, reckiefs of the filthy joy of gain,
I did, with micicle toil, and woful pain,
Much weariness and sweat of brain,
Sing forth, to you, the monitory strain !
Now, as wiih swan-like notes, my kind monition's fail,
Let me relate one much improving tale.
THE TALE.
An Irishman, with body half o'er-bent,
On all fides looking, thro'a market went. ââ¢
It happen'd, that as Teague proceeded,
Quite undetermined what he greatest needed,
He saw paraded, with enjoyment big,
Full many a heavy hog, and roasting pig.
With cautious touch, on one he placed hii hand,
And foftly uttered forth this kind demandâ
" If I should bear you to my home away,
" How long, confin'd, in prison must I stay ?"
Scar c was the question ended, but, " squeak ! squeak !"
The Pig affrighten'd crics.
44 A ha, a ha, a week, a week"
The Irishman repliesâ
44 Ifthatisall I'll off a couple bear,
44 Ana by St. Patrick ! flay two weeks, my dear."
*********
Now I expect, with deep bent brow,
To fee your countenances lower ;
And hear you a(kâ 41 Why whence, and where, and how,
44 Can this viletale, on us, improvement shower ?"
Yes, I cxpett that each will tell his brother ;
And this respond to that and thdt to t'otherâ
44 I can't fee how this ftcry will applyâ
44 No, on my foul, I can'tânot /ânor I; nor /.'*
My dear, dear friends, to lead you thro' the wood
Sav, don't you think that John is very good ?
Well thenâwhy this isall that's meantâ
It's true, the story don't apply at allâ
But then, if with the wisdom John hath to you lent,
You hard should study, tho' your wit be small,
I do not doubt but on the sense you'd fall.
This is the meaningâas you write for pav,
Tho greatest nonsense swell the impartial page,
Still write, remark, teview, and dash away,
The joy, and wonder, of a flupid age.
life other's wisdom ; if you can, sense shew ;
Hut, if you can't, by all means, fltll review.

attachment, execute in the name and behalf of a
refpeetable and grateful number of citizens.
History furnifhes instances of some eminently
qualified for ihe field, and of others endued with
talents adequate to the intricate affairs of State ;
but you, Sir, have enriched the annals of Ameri
ca with a proof, to be sent abroad to all mankind,
that, however rare the alfociation, the virtues
and talents of soldier and republican statesmen
will sometimes dwell together, and both charac
ters derive additional lultre from a subserviency
to the precepts of Religion.
Roused by oppreflion at home, and inspired by
example from America, the people of enlighten
ed nations in Europe are now beginning to allerc
their rights : And it is observable that those
brave men, the fubjedls of foreign powers, who
were votaries to our cause, and companions' in
your victories, are always found foremoft in the
struggle for just and equal government.
You have now, Sir, an opportunity of viewing
a State which, from its exposed situation, has
been peculiarly affedted by the calamities of war,
but which, under the influence of a happy go
vernment, will rife fact ro that rank of prosperi
ty and importance to which her natural advan
tages so justly entitle her, and which will enable
her to reflect back upon the union all the bene
fits derived from it.
We fliall always take a deep concern, in com
mon with the other citizens of the United States,
in whatever regards your personal welfare and
happiness. We make it our prayer to Almighty
God that you may be long continued to your
country her Ornament and Father, and that it
may be more and more exemplified in you. Sir,
that to know how to conquer, and to improve the
advantages of conquelt into blessings to a com
munity, are faculties sometimes bellowed on the
fame mortal.

GENTLEMEN,
I AM extremely happy in the occasion now af

ness, and to declare the sincere and afFedtionate
gratitude which it inspires.
The retrofpedl of paftfcenes, as it exhibits the
virtuous character of our country, enhances the
happiness of the present hour, and gives the nioffc
pleasing anticipation of progreflive prosperity.
The individual fatisfa&ion to be derived from
this grateful reflexion niuft be enjoyed in a pe
culiar degree by the deserving citizens of Geor
giaâa State no less distinguished by its services
than by its fufFerings in the cause of freedom.
That the city of Savannah may largely par
take of every public benefit which our free and
equal government can dispense, and that the
happiness of its vicinity may reply to the bell
wilhes of its inhabitants, is my sincere prayer.

PARIS, March ;i
IT appears that the Legion d'Afi>: a' Toulouse
had conceived the infernal project of mur
dering the commander in chief of the National
Guards, the whole Municipality, and fevera! pi
triotic merchants. The people, informed of this
diabolical plot, resolved to annihilate the whole
Legion. Three of the foldievs had been killed
and two made prisoners. The pi iloners reveal
ed the whole plot, and the Legionaries, finding,
that their intention had transpired, have escap
ed a-nd fled into Spain. It is supposed that there
is concealed somewhere a magazine of arms ;
lVuitleis attempts have been made to find it out.
Information is received from Colmar, that a
ranq;e of Beacons have been prepared along the
Rhine, which are ready to be lighted the mo
ment an alarm is given of the approach of an
enemy. They reach from Htiinyue to Straf

Four Members of the Diplomatic Committee
waited on the ift. instant, on M. Monttnorin, to
Â«xprefs their surprise and indignation, at the ap
pointment of new ministers to foreign courrs.
M. Montmorin answered, " that the King had
approved the choice which had been made, and
that, for his part, he thought it an excellent one."
" But, fir," fays M. de Menou, "M. Gouvernet,
appointed to go to Holland, is Member of the
Monarchic Club." " What fignifies that," an
swered M. Mommorin, " He is not the worse
Patriot on that account. M. Clermont Tonneri e,
is he also a true Patriot ?âCertainly. And all
the members of the Monarchic Clubâace they
alio true patriots !âWho doubts it :âFor mv
part, I firmly believe they are ; liefides, i:i the
present moment it would be highly improper to.
lend to foreign courts, persons who have fignai
ifed themselves in the revolution."
M. de Menou denounced this conversation,
which pafled between him and the Minister, to
rhe Clu'odes Jacobins, who mean to take it into
serious confi.ieraiion. M. Montrnorin is Mitiif
ter, but the members of the club are sovereigns
over ministers

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
Received information of the Election of two
Conllitutioual Bifliops, one of Valines, and ano
ther of Ninies.
M. Maury moved, that an enquiry be made in
to the validity of the debt of 4,000,000 livres,
claimed by M. d'Orleans, and which it was his
opinion ought not to have been voted to be paid,
as the public owes him nothing. The Jacobins
got rid of the motion in a moment, by moving
the order of the day.
A motion w.is made that the fartrefs of Vin
cennes be demolished ; but it appeared t hat there
were so many people imprisoned the'e, that there
are no other prisons capacious enough to contain
them. Of one class there are 1820 ; and of ano
ther 1004; beside 600 who infill to accompany
thole eight lately imprisoned in consequence of
the late Iracas atthe fhuilleries, as being, equal
ly with them, either guilty or innocent, and
claiming to have a legal trial.
Resolved, that tlie works on the Dungeon of
Vinceanes be llopt for the present.
M. Scutaz informed the AtFembly that an ad
drels from tlie Diltrict of Auch had been receiv
ed, giving an account that the whole country is
in the greatest fermentation, owing to the refu
fal of moil of the efcclefialtics to take the Civic
Oath,
The order of the day was, the qtaeftion relative
to pet Tons in public employments, among whom
the King was included. The debate which fol
lowed was, if pollible more tumn'tuary than uf'i
al. M. endeavoured to read the

form of a decree containing a declaration, tli3t
ic was highly criminal to take the propoials of
the committee into consideration. inilantly a
number of voices were heard together, clamour
ing, a cha> cnton âto prison ! but M. d'Elpreme
till continued to read till Jie was silenced by tlif
President. Before he fat down, lie made use of
the following proverbial exprelliqii, to which he
probably applied a much Itronger meaning than
his antagouilt didâRira hen qui bira le dernier.
The third and fourth Decrees of the series
which then palled, are very remarkable, and
will probably be productive, hereafter, of the
mod serious consequences. They are as follows :
" The King, holding the firlt pnblic employ
inent, shall relide at no greater distance than JO
leagues from the National Afl'embly, while h is
fitting. At other times hemayrefide any where
within the kingdom."

Several more articles were decreed, " On the
efulence of persons in public employment," a
,nong whom were included tlie prefuinptive Heir
to th; Crown and his Mother. The word queen is

Mr. Seward, of Gofwell street, by profeffion a

hanger, which he frequently brandished as if
ready to llrike, though repeatedly urged by Mr.
Seward not to frighten his lady.
Mrs. Seward, at length, almost wild with her
fears, caught hold of a broken Hick on the feat

Death of M. Mirabtau,
The last letters from Paris have brought a con
firmation of the death of M. Mirabeau on Satur
day morning last, tlie 2d init. at half pait ei[>lit
o'clock, after aniHnefs violent and (liorr, in the
firit part of which he was frequently delirious
and throughout in great pain.
From the lii it appearance ot his indisposition,
it was known to be dangerous, and bulletins,
announcing insinuation, were published hourly ;
notwithstanding which, the populace waited ac
his gate in great numbers, anxious, through af
fection and curiosity, to obtain the earliest in
telligence of his fate.
The buzz of the crowd, and even the voices
of the hawkers who cried these Bulletins were
audible in his chamber. A few hours before his
death, one of his friends remarked to him this
instance of the eltimation in which he was held
by his countrymen â" Ah ! (said he) I perceive
that it mult be acceptable to tlie for them." In
the beginning.of his disorder, his hope of reco
very was great ; but his courage in the fubfe
quentftages of it, was not Jess. He deliberately
made his will, and recollecting that a law relat
ing to teftauients was then before the National
Ailembly, he said to the Abbe de Taleyrand, t lie
late Bifliop of Autunâ" The National Afiembly
is now engaged upon a law relating to testaments,
and they will not think it unfuitable,that anian,
who has juil made one, should offer them his opi
nion upon the queltion, as his last homage. I
entrull this paper to your care, to be read to the
Afiembly."
He died in the 42d year of his age, leaving
many of his intended plans imiinÂ»/hed ; but at
a time when his reputation had attained a height
which it probably would not have exceeded. .
A rumour was I'pread the moment that M. de
Mirabeau was dead, that he had been poiToned.
This rumour has been proved fnlfe, by opening
the body of the deceased ; which operation was
performed by the molt Jkilful Surgeons, in tlie
presence of a great number of other Surgeons,
and multitudes of people. Every Vifcus was fe
paratelv examined. Not the least foundation
for the injurious suspicion appeared.
He had in a great measure destroyed his con
stitution by excessive indulgences and tuirultu
ous pleasures. The evening that he was taken;
ill, he had given himfelf up to every riotous en
joyment which a depraved imagination couid
desire. Every medical alliftance was procured
which the capital could afford : bark, camphire/
blisters, &c. were tried, without effect. His bÂ»-
dy was wrapped in sheep's ikin, warn from the
newly killed animals, with a view to restore ani
mal heat.âAll to no purpose.
He fuffered a great deal, but he fnffered like a
man. The new Conllitution, and the welfare of
the Nation, occupied his .whole attention to his
very last moments. The spirit and energy of
his mind remained to the lail.
His Secretary wounded hitnfelf by three stabÂ»
in the jugular vein, given with a pen-knife.â
This ralhnefs is attributed by the world to a va
riety of motives, none of which are perhaps the
true ones.
All the members of the National Assembly are
to attend the funeral of M. de Mirabeau. A de
putation from the municipality of Pai is, with the
Mayor at their head, are also to be present at the
mournful ceremony.
The following anecdote of M. de Mirabeau
will be the surest trait we can give of his moral
character. It is original, but universally known
to every person acquainted with the French
court.
M. de Mirabeau was the son of the Comte de
Mirabeau, a man of learning and perfectly well
bred, but not remarkable for the severity of his
morals. The Conite and his wife having lived
unhappily together, were at length set at liberty
by a mutual reparation. The Comte, whose con
jugal unhappinefs was still fie(h in his mind,
applied to his own son to write a pamphlet for
him against his wife.âThe pamphlet was writ
ten by young Mirabeau againlt his own mother f
It was entitled I'Ami des Hotumes ; and the price
of his labors was 100 Louis d'ors, which he re
ceived from liia father. His mother complain
ing to him of the indecency of this filial outrage,
â" Madame," fays young Mirabeau, "givenie
200 Loi/is d'ors and 1 will write another pamphlet
against my father, in vindication of your cha
racter."
Mirabeau was certainly, in point of genius and
talents, one of the greateil men trance ever
knew
The champion of the oppoftre, or Monarchic
party in the National .Allembly, is the Abbe
Maury.âHe has frequently been (liled the Bcjfu
et of the present age. He is all'uredly far fupc
rior in talents ami eloquence to any one of ilie
Jacobins whom M. de Mirabeau has left belniihitn ; he may, therefore, be expetfced to make
proselytes to his cause, provided conviJiion were
fufficient tp ensure a reformation.
M. de Mirabeau was the author of several
works which are held in high eltimation ; a
niongothers Memoirs Secrets de la Cottr de Berlin,
Sur /'Agiotage, ire. ire. The Courier de Provence
was also publilhed under his direction. He was
afluredly the prop and pillar of the Duke of Or
leans's party, and of the Jacobin's club, which
may be confideted as the privy council of the
French nation.
How many reflexions does the death of this
JM. de Mirabeau occasion ! He has experienced
the turbulence of mad ambition ; he has been
the admiration of some, the envy of others, and
the curse of many ; he has ih utted his fliorrhour
on the stage, and while he was dreaming of im
perial power, the grave yawns beneath his feet,
and he finks into it a lump of clay ! Ye sons of
ambition ! You are all walkingover your graves !
âWhile you are gazing on thrones and sceptres,
you stumble at noon day, and lose your honors
in the dust !
Mirabeau, at a very early period of life, ac
quired a very extensive reputation, by the bril
liancy of his wit, and (till more by the solidity
and extent of his mental acquirements. His pe
netration was acute, his talents were various and
versatile ; and his knowledge of men and man
ners remarkably extensive. When he was of an
age at which many are still novices at fchool,one
of the fir ft characters in France, who had with
wonder witnelfed the vail compass of his under
standing, in a letter to a friend ltyles him a
Phenomenon !
He was one of those few, who are able to unite,
with a life of dissipation, literary pursuits, and
deep researches into the nature of government,
the law of nations, and the relative interests of
the powers of Europe. His ambition prompted
him, at the ssra of the revolution, and his su
perior abilities enabled him, to take the lead in
the framing of the new Conllitntion, and in
overturning the old system.
He was the Ulyjfes, and M. de la Fayette was
the Ajax. The views of both were unlimited
power ; the pretexts or ostensible motives of
both were pattiotifm and the securing of equal
and universal liberty to all mankind. The
Dupes of both were a great majority in the
Senate and in the Municipality of Paris, and
the millionsoftheprovinces. [Extensive indeed /]
The Orleans party has fuffered an irreparable
loss by the death of Mirabeaii. This party was
in a fair way of triumphing over all others, and
of ettablilhing pure republication, which would
shortly have degenerated, as it was intended, in
to renovated defpotifrn under a new head, deco
rated with a new name.
M. de Mirabeau and M. de la Fayette had been
for some time secret but inveterate enemies ; but
the imperative boalt of Ciceroâcedant ArmaToga
âwould have been realized, had M. de Mirabeau
lived a little longer.
Allowing M de la Fayette, which is a doubtful
claim, to be Armh Prcepoteus, it might with more
truth have been said of his antagonist tantum valet
ipfe loquendo.

Circular Letter oj the Convention of the Univers
Churches, met at Philadelphia.
THE Ministers and Representatives from the
several Churches, believing in the Salva
tion of all Men, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, met in annual convention in Philadelphia,
May 25, i79f.
To the several Churches and Societies in the belief of
the fame most precious truth with usâGreeting.
BeiovedÃrethren,
IT gives us great pleasure to inform you that
we had a most agreeable meeting, and that we
have received tidings from several Churches and
Societies, that the troths of God's univerfa], ab
solute and unchangeable love, of the universa
lity of the atonement for fin through the blood
of Christ, and of the final restoration of the whole
human race, to a state- of happiness (notwith-
Handing the reality of future panifhments) pre
vail against all opposition ; and that God our Sa
viour hath infome instances over-ruled the oppo
sition to the forwarding thereoFv
We are happy in being able further to inform
you, that the request of the convention of lall
year, that those persons who believed with us in
the Salvation of all Men, ihould atiociate and form
themselves into Churches, has been complied
with in a degree which has equalled our mod
sanguine expectations. Several Churches have
likewise formed, which are too remote to unite
with us. Nor is the encreafing prevalence of the
glorious truths we believe, confined to the United
States: We have lately heard with great plea
sure that they have been manifefted to many in
foreign countries. And now, dear Brethren, as
the genuine tendency of this mod precious dif
covery of God's unchangeable and univerfa! love,
is to promote love and good works, we hope every
believer in it will manifeft the fame in his life
and conversation, and that you will in meekness
bear with those of your fellow heirsof Salvation,
who, thro' prejudice, are opposed to the blefl'ed
truths we maintainâand that you \*ill endeavor
to remove such prejudices by holy, harmless and
ufeful lives, conformable in all things to the ex
ample and precepts of our defied Lord and Sa
viour, whose will it is that all shall come to the
knowledge of the truth.
We conclude, by commendingyou and all men
ro the care of him to whom all fouls belong, and
who hath redeemed them to himfelf by his most
precious blood, to whom be glory forever. Amen.

SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
1 he good people of the United States are fre
quently entertained with remarks on the excel
lency of eletflion and representation. Our go
vernment is a free republic, principally on ac
count of its being a government by representa
tion. All the powers veiled in the rulers being
delegated powersâand we justly expedt that a peo
ple so enlightened as the citizens of America,
will never negletft their duty in electing the molt
meritorious characters for legislators and magi
strates. So long as the light of education is kept
clear and bright, the people will duly estimate this
privilege. The feturity of liberty is universally
acknowledged to depend on this molt eflemial
point. But, it seems a notable discovery has late
ly been made,* and that is, " that the eleflion of
the members of the general government is liable
to so much corruption by parties, cabals, briberies,
interefls, connexions, and an infinite group-oi other
jjnifler prejudices, that it is not conceived that one
instance 111 ten can be produced of an appoint
ment of the bell qualified and fitteft pcrfon by such
electionsâand therefore the grand check, for the
feturity of our liberties, lies in the ft ate govern
ments." But, alks a correspondent, is it probable
that the legillatures of the several Ibates will be
chosen by better elertors than tliofe of the gene
ral government ? Are they not the fame indivi
dual electors ? If so, whence the propriety of
making a difference in our ideas refpetling them.
It may be fafely aflerted, that the general go
vernment is at Jeafl equally, if not more popular
in its organization, than any of the individual
governments âand therefore an attempt to de
preciate it, in any refpetfl whatever, is in fatft to
llvike at the liberties of the people.

the continuance of the lease.
The bridges ate to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as shall render them perfe&ly substantial and secure in

mmediate income of 900 pounds per aim. This mav fairly be
eftimatcd as the fmallett profit that can be calculatcd upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter
com V between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftru&ion of these bridges will give to travel
ing, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the western fide of the Hudson, are all important
drcumftances, which must neceflarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioncrs are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads conne&ed
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places shall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the contra&s for eie&ing them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contrast on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to William Max w f. i. l,
Esq. in New-York, fpecifying the shortest period of lease for
which they will undertake to ereftthe said bridges, together with
proper security for performing the fame.
