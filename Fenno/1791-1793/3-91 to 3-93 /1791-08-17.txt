PHILADELPHIA, August 17,
SUPREME COURT OF the UNITED STATES
"Wednesday, August 3d
(concluded.)
JUDGE BLAIR said, that although it was true that the Writ
ot Error was a Writ of Right, upon which account Mr. Brad
lord had contended that its use was only to express the will of
the plaintiff in error, to have the judgment re-examined, and
that, therefore, it was not so material from what office it had is
sued, especially as the Judiciary Bill was silent as to that, yet
the writ was an indifpenfible requisite ; but a writ not issued in
the legal mode ftiould be considered as no writ. The question
then was, whether having ilfued from the Clerk's Office of the
Circuit Court, where the judgment fought to be redrefled was
rendered, it could be supported as valid ? He admitted, that the
dire6tion that it fhouli be returnable to the Supreme Court did not,
vi termini, necessarily imply that it ought to illuc ftom the
Clerk's Office of that Court; bccaufe whatever may be the popular
sense of the word * returnable,' writs which in England iirued
from the Chancery, were, in a legal sense, said to be returnable
into the King's Bench, or that Court where they were to be made
use of. But that there being no such general and fepara'.e repo
sitory of writs in America, he took it to be the general pra&ice
to issue writs from the fame Courts to which, in a ftritt sense,
they were to be returned, and never to issue them, as in the pre
ient iriHance, from the Clerk's Office of the fame Court whose
judgment was fought to be corre6ted. He admitted, that as the
law now stands, it would be attended, in some initances, with
great inconvenience and hardship, to make it necclfary for the
plaintiff in en or to apply for the writ at the feat of government
of the United States, from which the Circuit Court, where the
record remains, may be too remote, to permit him to lodge a
copy of the writ there within ten days from the time of render
ing the judgment ; because, if not so lodged, it will not operare
as a fuperfedeas to the judgment, and the recoverer may take out
execution. It is true, that the plaintiff in error, without so lodg
ing a copy, may go on with the Writ of Error, and if he ffiould
finally prevail, will be entitled to rtftftution ; but still, to be ex
posed in the mean time to an execution, would at any time be a
serious evil ; and, in the now exifttng combination of circumstan
ces in our country, peculiarly such. He thought, however, that
this evil, whatever might be its magnitude, required legislative
corre&ion, rather than that the Court ffiould, tor the fake of
avoiding it, eftablilh an unusual, and very irregular pia&ice. A
futut c -hi w may remove e very hardship, by allowing, instead of
ten days, luch a length of time, for depofiung a copy ot the Writ
of Error 111 the Clerk's Office, as may be pioportioned to its dis
tance from the feat of government. For these reasons he was
against the motion, for a rule to be made upon the defendants in
error, to rejoin.
JUDGE WILSON.
The determination of the gueftion in will be of im
poitance-not ouJy ro the parties immftfiaiciy i uterc Itcd,'"But aJf 0
to others : for it will piobably have an influence upon the de
termination of future cases of the fame or of a (imilar nature.
It is thciefore proper that, while I give my opinion, I (hould
aflign the reasons on which it is founded.
There are two modes of removing a decision from an inferior
to a superior jur ifdiftion. One is by appeal, which is merely
the art of ike party. But it is not contended that the proceedings
in th- present cause, are or can be removed by an appeal. It
they are before us at all, they mud have come before us by a Wnt
of Error This is admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff; and
on this supposition we are applied to for the exercise of juiildic
tion, by giving a rule on the defendant to plead to the alignment
ot errors. We are therefore led to the queftion âIs this such a
V/rii as willjuitify and authorise the court in exercising a revifion
ar} jurifdi&ion over the decision and proceedings of the Circuit
Court of the Diftri& of Rhode-Island ?
AWr t is deicribed, and very properly, to be a mandatory * lit
ter. A Wiit of errpi, as well as other Writs, must partake of this
mandatory quality. But how can a Court diieft a mandatory let
ter to itfelf ?
It was observed by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, that a
â writ of Error is a commiflion to revise proceedings. True. But
it is defcnbed as a commiflion directed to a fupeiior junfdiÂ£tion.+
Bcfides, in considering this commiflion, we must view nÂ«t only
the junfdi&ion to which it is directed, but likewifethe authority
from which it flows. Shall it flow trom an inferior to a superior
Court ? This courfc would be unnstural : it would be the stream
of authority inverted.
It was also mentioned by the learned counftl for the plaintiff
in error, that, in the ast of Congvels, it is not fpccijicd from
â what Com t the Writ of Erroi must issue. This is very ti ue. But
since it is not fpecified, we must form our opinion on general
principles and usages. Thele, as we havejuft now feel), will lead
us to the superior rather than to the injerior jurifdittion.
The 14th fcÂ£tion of the ast of Congress, however, seems to put
the solution of the prefrnt beyond the poflibility of a doubt. By
that ft&ion the Courts of the United Stales t{ have power to issue
'â¢ all Writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be
44 neceflary for the exercise of their refpeÂ£tive jurifdi&ions, and
agreeable to the principles and usages of law." Now, this is
the Court which is to exercise jurifdiftlonâthis is the Court to
ivhich application is made by the plaintiff himfelf, for the exer
cise of its jurifdittion in the present caufc. This, therefore, is
she Court, which, in the teims of the aÂ£\, shall il have the power
11 to issue the Writ neceflary for the exercise of that jurifdiftion."
The Court from which the Writ of Error is to iffwe, is not fpe
cialiv pointed out by ftatnte. That Writ must therefore issue
44 agreeably to the principles and usages of lÂ»w." Ofthofe prin
ciples and usages, we have already fecn the dire&ion and the
force. From ihele prcmifes, the inference seems to be conclu
de that the Writ of Error must issue from this Court.
An inconvenience was luggelltd and prell'ed with much strength
ar.d ingenuity by thccounfel tor the plaintiff ; that at a great dif
lance from the feat of governmentâin Georgia, for instance, or
Kentucky -it would be impoilible, afterthe judgment complain
ed of, to comply, in the limited time of ten days, with the con
ditions required by the ast for rendering the Writ of Error a fu
perfedeas to an execution. If this inconvenience (hould fuhfift
in all the force which has been fUted ; it nral be removed by
tnothei power. We ast in the judicial, not in the Itgijlative de
partment.
The inconvenience may perhaps be mitigated by a method
which 1 (hall suggest ; not, however, as a part of my opinion iri
the determination of the point before us. A Writ of Error may
kcar icftc and may be obtained before the " giving of the judg
nnt" in the Court below. This, in England, is the uiual course
i< preventing and fupcrfeding execution.}: Indeed this mode
Cms to be intimated by a claufc in the Writ itfelf. tc Wecom
'nand you, that, if judgment be given, then you fend the record
4 Snd procefs,"J| See.
tis true that the expence of a Writ of Error obtained in this
miner will be fupeifluous, if the party who apprehend a judg
nnt against him, fhail obtain one in his favor. This lupernous
e>ence, however, can be the occasion of no very great hardship.
I ate the expedient as calculated to mitigate the inconvenience
coplained of t but not as forming a ground ot my opinion in
th caufe.^
ly opinion iÂ«, that the proceedings of the Circuit Court for
th diftriftof Rhode-Island are not jndicially before us; and that,
fothis reason, the motion of tht counfcl tor the plaintiff cannot
beuftained.

JUDGE LUSHING.
Tie writ offered to'the Court at present, by the counsel for the
*>laitiff, does not appear to me to be such a writ as will bring
the rocecdings of ibe Circuit Court of Rhnde-Ifland, properly
befoe this Court. By the ast of Congress, it is true, that â¢ Wnt
of Eror mÂ» iflue either from the Circuit Court, or trom this.
But ly necefTary implication, it feemi, that when it is for the pur
poferf removing a cause from a Circuit, to this Court, the autiori
ty ftould be derived immediately from this court. I cannot be
lievethat Congress designed, a Circuit Court (hould have power
to renove its own proceedings to this Court; but that the authori
ty foi this end, (hould flow from the Court that was to exercise the
contiouling and reviflng power. If such, then, be the meaning of
the National Legislature, it is not our province to alter or amend
their acts, but to ground our opinions upon them. If inconveni
ences (hould arise, in carrying their laws into effett, with them
lies the power of correcting the inconveniences, and not with us.
As the writ before us, therefore, is not from this, but from the
Circuit Court of Rhode-Island, I cannot think, that upon its au
thority, we can proceed to rtvife the judgment of that Court.

opinion, it were needless to repeat thera. I need only, there,

EXTRACTS.âOn EDUCATION,
ONE of the fir ft laws of Maflaclmfetts provid
ed, That the SeleiSmen shall have a vigi
lant eye over parents, that they lhall duly endea
vor, liy thetnl'elves, or others, to iiiltru<fl their
children in learning; and that if, after warning
given by the Selectmen, any parent shall be neg
ligent, he shall be fined." Some think this Jaw
to have been rather arbitvary, but the reason the
law-makers thcmfelves aiTign will be f'atisfaJtory.
They r ay, " left the children should grow bar
barous, rude and stubborn, and lb prove pests,
ttijleadof biejpngj to their country."
The learned and patriotic Dr. Price, in a late
difcoufe, fays, " Our firft concern as lovers of
our cointry, must be to enlighten it. Why are
the tiaions of the world so patient under defpot
il'm ?b it not bpcaufe they are kept in darkness
and w:nt of knowledge ?âenlighten them, and
you wil elevate them."
Shoild the feniinaries of learning be neglect
ed by lie Commonwealth, there can be no way
to fupprt them, but by enhancing the price ot
educaton. The rich men will then give their
childra an education, Â« hile the people in the
middlevvalk of life, and the poor, will be denied
the priilege of learning. The people will then
be oblied to hold learning in contempt, to ex
clude . from their public afiemblies; or, the
powersif government, and the offices will be held
by the ich in exclusion of the others. The firll
alternate leads toaflate of barbarism, the other
leads to riltocracy and despotism.
Tlieres in men a natural pride, and a natural
envy, lie wealthy are apt to hold the poor in
contemp and the poor are apt to envy the opu
lence ofne great. These tempers, however re
prehenfile they are, have their use in iociety ;
the firlt lads the wealthy to support govern
ment, th<latter induces a spirit of equality,which
prevcntshat government from rising to a itate
of defpofni.
The hairs and education of the rich lead to
ariftocrar, and if they can have a monopoly of
the learing of tVie country, there will be an end
of dcmo'acy ; the equality which is uow the
125

glory of our country, will never more be seen,
and rlie calamity of America will blast the hopes
of the patriotic pare of the European world.
Paiems are led by their fondnefs for their pos
terity, to try to give ihem an education: hue
they have but little imerell in the business in
comparison with what society hasâParents are
soon removed from their tender connexion with
their children, but society remains forever, and
mull be happy or miserable, in proportion as
knowledge and information are poll'efled by it.

Permit a Holland Patriot to blame the uncau
tious fecuriiy of the French nation, who negledi
the means of discovering the secret manoeuvres
and complicated political schemes of sOl eign
courts. It is by their means ttiat fears and
fions take place in the new departments of that
glorious regenerated kingdom. It is that daik
fyltem of politics, which, by means of mercena
ry writers and seditious tools, misleads opinions,
and occasions internal commotions. All these
enemies will not acft from the exterior upon
France ; but internally they are much more to
be feared. What are the intentions of those
cries of expected invasions but seditious rumors,
railed and kept up by the agents I have men
tioned ?
To disquiet the French, and divide, if poilible,
the kingdom, is the plan of a few powers which
appear to me to be busy in confuhing measures
as a central committee in the cabinet at Hague.
Fiance has nothing to fear but from a civil war,
which l'oine of her neighbours would wilh to
fend them either by the means of Ambafladors,
or by persons in an inferior capacity ; âthe latter
are more to be feared. What are, it may be
said, these intrigues and intriguing persons, when
compared to the great principles of an Afiembly
working the regeneration of a powerful king
dom ? True ; âbut still may not France, for want
of more circumfpeftion, pay with the effufion of
more blood tor the revolution which does them
honor, and for the happiness which awaits them ?
Let them not forget the device, which the foun
ders of the Batavian Republic adopted : Concor
dia res paw# cr~efcunt, difcordia maxim# dilabuntur.

By the new constitution of Poland, tlie Kit,

It will never be forgot in Poland, that 011 ie

laus Augustus discharged his guards. In ne

absolutely refnfed to have a single man of lis
usual guard with him, but mixed with the Sea

her taking the Crimea in 1 782. But let it bi re
membered, that at both those periods Francethe
ancient ally of Turkey, the natural protecltr of
her independence, was in full vigor. It c uld
not be the policy of England to strengthen the
ally of her rival, nor could lhe have any reaon
able alarms for the independence of a pcwer

Philadelphia, August 17.
European intelligence is received to the 18th June,
A motion in tlie National Assembly June 10,
by M. Roberfpierre, to disband the army, occa
sioned a warm and lengthy debate ; the next
day the opinion of the committee of the confti
tut ion 011 this fuhjecl was received, read, and
adoptedâthe substance of which was, to fimpK
fy and more perfectly regulate the ltahdiug for
ces, and provide more effectually for the fidelity
of the commiflioned officers, &c.
This report contained a request that tiie King
would give notice to M. Condc that his refidente
near the frontiers gives uneafinels to the inhab
itants, and requiring him to return into the
kingdom, or to remove from the frontiers with
in 15 daysâif lie does not conform to the de
crees of .tlig. Ailembly he is to be declared a rebel.
~*Juue 14. Eight articles were decreed intended
to prevent combinations of journeymen to raise
wagei-r-or of employers to lower the price of
labor.
A curious letter from the Abbe Raynal (now
in decrepitude and dotage) was received by the
National Aflembly, the firft of June : This let
ter contains all the common place dodtrine of
the aristocratic failion, about deitroying the
power of the crown and the noblefle ; M. Ma
louetit is said has the honor of drawing the Abbe
to this miserable contraditlion of the former
doifhines of his life ; this letter was read with
out interruption and very little notice taken of it.
Two letters were received, one from the Ame
rican Congress, and one from the Aflembly of
Fennfylvania, thanking tlie Aflembly for tlie
tribute they had paid to the memory of Dr.
Franklin, and expressing the high regard which
America entertained for the acfts and fentinients
of the National Aflembly of France. These let
ters were ordered to be printed.

committed a larceny, in having taken tlie goods
of Henry Williams on the high seas ; whereupon
the said Eleanor pleaded not guiltyâher trial was

[continued.]
IT is witliin the recollection of every person,
how generally the conduift of the Itate of Rhode-
Island was reprobated for the inveterate opposi
tion which (he made to the five per cent, inipolt
proposed by the Congress under the old confede
ration. Similar principles induced that state to
recede for a time from an adoption of the new
conftitntion. The imperfection of human wil
dom and forefiglu was perhaps nevermore ftrik
iâgly exemplified than on this occasionâwhat
was denominated obstinacy, in refped: to tliefive
per cent, proved, perhaps, the salvation of our
liberties.
Had the Congress of the old confederation been
invested with general powers to raise a revenue,
the people of the United States, and their polfe
rity after them, would have been under the go
vernment of an uncontrouled elective aridocracy
â a (ingle allembly, without any check but the
remote, discordant voices of thirteen diftind, in
dependent sovereignties. Inlteud of which, thio
the favor of Providence, we are now blefled with
a free, just, and equal government, founded 011
a conftitntion that will stand the ted of ages
a constitution poflefting in itfelf a progielhng
principle of perfection, wifely providing for such
amendments as a more refined state of society,
and the greater security of civil liberty fliall die
rate to be necefl'ary. Jealousy, which is always
laudable when controuled by realon, prevented
the people of Rhode-lfland from feeling the force
of argument in favor of the new constitution for
a timeâbut difficulties of various descriptions
rapidly increased upon that people in an alien
state tliefe, in conjunction with the indefatiga
ble exertions to difFufe federal principle? and in
formation 011 the part of the friends to their peace
and credit, at length effected a revolution of sen
timentâThe ratification of the constitution fol
lowedâon that joyous event party became ex
tintftâpublic affairs aflunied a new faceâand
every impending cloud began to diflipate. she
state appears now to be tranquil and happyâ
their trade eiicreafing, and a spirit of enterprize
in various branches is displayed.
Some recent tranfadions in regard to education
indicate a just sense of the importance of learn
ing to the securing and perpetuating freedom;
while, at the fame time, the djitinguifhed bene
volence of the more wealthy part of the citizens,
in patronizing inffi'utions, that w ill prove a per
petual tax upon their eftaies, merits the highest
eulogium. May knowledge and freedom ever
be the charaderiflics of this small, but spirited
and independent member of ttie union. 1 liede
cided and prompt sentiments of attachment to
the general government, which dillinguilh
the political publications of this flute from time
to time, mull: have been recognized by, and given
pleaftire to every friend to our country.
Among the numerous advantages consequent
on the re-union of these confederated states iin
. der the new constitution, we may justly reckon
the almost total extinction of local prejudices,
and contracted (late-policyâfor although fotne
persons are yet haunted with the frightful idea
of such an inveterate incompatibility of' interests,
as will eventually disturb, if not diflolve the
Union,.yet adverting to facts, we find that there
is no reason to fuppoie that a spirit of illiberal
jealousy will ever disgrace our councils, or dis
turb the peace of our country.
' The state of Vermont had for several years
been an independent republic, -previous to the
late recognition of the fad: 011 the part of the ge
neral government. Several propositions had from
time to time been submitted to the old Congress,
refpecling her being acknowledged as an inte
gral branch of the Unionâbut all these applica-
tions proved ineffectualâthere were so many
private views to contravene the vviibes of the
Verrhontc/e, that it was very problematical whe
ther they would have been ever cordially con
ceded ro under the old confederation. But their
profpec'ts became bright at the moment of ratify
ing the n.ew conftitmion ; and a fair difcuflion
of the merits of ihe fnbjetfl, aided by the univer
sal reprobation of local policy, caused every ob
stacle to vatiifh. Vermont is now a constituent
member of the confederacyâand there can be no
doubt of her proving a valuable link in the fe
deral chain. Since that happy event, the most
cursory obferveis mult have I'een the plea/ing ctf
fecis resulting from her new situationâher vieiCsy
are expandedâvarious objeiTts, of great
tance to her interest, arrelt the attention of/her
citizensâher agriculture, arts and manufactures,
liave imbibed an invigorating principleâ-and the
great business of education is duly appreciated
by the people. These subjects appear to be dif
canred on with new spirit by the writers in their
weekly Gazetteâa paper that difieniinates re
publican, federal sentiments. Vermont is, and
will be, chiefly inhabited by a hardy race of free
men, and independent owners and tillers of the
foilâamong which flie has her proportion of men
of genius, science, and profellional abilities.

YE glorious guardians of Britannia's fame !
Warm'd with the brightcftray from Vi> tue's flame,
To You torn flav'ry's rending eyeballs roll,
For You ascends his eloquence of foul !
Thou Son of Chatham*, whose all pow'rful hand,
Guides the deep councils of thy native land,
To whom protected millions bend the knee,
While all thy godlike father beams in thee,
Ah ! yet thy heaven-inftrufted voice extend
To Him, whom ancry fate denies a friend.
Thou too, Great Pat r iot+, whose resistless art
Plays round the purple eddies of the heart,
And, like the sacred light'ning's liquid ray,
Fills the whole breast and melts the foui away,
Or, darting thro' the breast's mysterious rounds,
Spreads light, where " Darkness visible" abounds,
Again that thund'ring eloquence dispense,
Pierce the hard head and thrill the torpid sense,
Confirm the holy vows, by virtue made,
Destroy of blood the priceâof man the trade,
Illufttious Bur ke, on whose enchanting tongue,
Applauding Senates wrapt in paffton hungÂ§,
Whose ardent foul burns o'er oppreflion's deeds,
Whose feeling heart at every sorrow bleeds,
Whose boundless pen through wide creation flows,
Here mourns the monarch's wrong's, the people's woes,
And here, to philofophick truths a guide,
Celestial Virtue, smiling at thy fide,
Claims a!l thy powers, and bends her view to thee,
Patron of tiu.th ! light of humanity !
Still all ihe charmer in thy voice display.
Tho' the deaf adder turns his away.
"Britannia's Patriots ! Guardians of her laws \
Unite in Mercy's, Honor's, Vi rtu e's, cause !
Ah ! yet the ju(t benignant ast renew,
Which the good Barclay's great disciples drew,
For whom from broken hearts, and delug'd eyes,
Shall many a grateful pray'r like incense, rife.
Unite, ye patriot bands, redeem the Slave,
On you he calls, and claims your power to save ;
As round the pole th' ele&rick fluid (preads,
And gives a twilight to the.funlcfs meads,
So glimmering hope o'er wilder'd bondage flows,
And sheds rfiild radiance thro' a night of woes ;
Then, still auspicious, waft the refluent strain,
Nor pour the heav'n descended ray in vain ;
Soon shall the lingering Orb of Justice rife,
Warm the cold waste, and light tie cheerless skies,
Bid the fell despot's dark oppreflion cease,
Give the chain'd vi&im LIBERTY and PEACE.

The public utility of extending this wharf, is too evident to re
cjuire any comment, to those who are acquainted with the town
and harbour of New-Haven; to those who are not, fuffice it to fay,
that its beautiful situation is not surpassed, if equalled by any ; be
ing in the heart of a country, which may, with propriety, be said
to be the garden of America. The harbour lays open to the found
but by realon of the flats, this wharf is necessarily extended to the
channel, where (hips can load and unload ; and when compleat
ed, will be the moll extensive and commodious wharf in America,
the whole extent being about 3>4ths of a mile; and not only the
mercantile interest of New-Haven and the towns adjacent, but the
maritime interest of all the States will be benefited by it. The
general wish that prevails in the minds of all c lades of people, for
the success of this enterprise, together with the very great advan
tage which this fchcme holds out to adventurers (there being more
capital prizes for the number of tickets than any yet publilhed in
America) induce the managers to believe thÂ« tickets will meet with
a speedy sale.
The drawing will positively commence at the State-House, in
New-Haven, on the 13th of September next, or sooner, if the
tickets are fold.
A lift of the fortunate numbers will be published, and the prizes
paid on demand, by the managers. Those prizes not called for in
nine months after drawing, will be deemed as generously given
101 the ule ot the wharf, and appropriated accordingly.
