From tht (Hartford) AMERICAN MERCURY.
The patriot
TtyT Y concluded with reciting the induce
nients proper to be held out to h.-ad trades
men, concerned in certain manufadares, to en
able them to take the children of such poor fa
milies, as apprentices, as were unable to furnifh
their children in the manner now practifexl.
1 hisfpeculation fliall be devoted to the conside
ration of such further inducements to letting up
and prosecuting the manufactures of linen, cot
ton, and woollen, as may be neceflary for fully
inrvoducing andeffeifluaily efla'olifliingthofe ina
nu.aiures. f lax is amongit the productions of
almoil every farm ; yet we have it not in faflici
eiit plenty n;;c! perfection for the purpose of
carrying 011 extensive manufactures. It is how
ever reasonably to be expected, that every year
will add to the quantity brought to marketâand
that the quality will be proportionably improved.
Nothing will expedite this defireable end so
much as the establishment of a linen and cotton
manufacture. Fine bearled flax is not neceflary
e ".' ler / or ri ggi"g or duckâneither will the
price given for flax in those manufactures enable
the farmers to prepare their flax properly for
market. When ever there is a demand for flax
to make fine cloth, then the farmers will raise
better flax, and dress it in another manner.
The more certain and constant the demand for
any articles, and the higher the price, the more
will there be of that article at market. Let
Congress compel the owners of every ship orvef
fel to make the firft Tuit of fails of American
duckâand let thisftate in the mean time give a
moderate bounty on every piece of duck manu
factured in the HateâThis would effectually an
swer the purpose. Let them give a premium or
bounty of two Ihillings on every piece of linen,
or linen and cotton cloth, not less than 24 yards
a "d i yards wide, of the value of is. 6d.
per yard âFor every piece of furh cloth not less
than 24 yards long and ayard wide, of the value
of two ihillings per yard, a bounty of 2S. 6d.â
tor every such piece of the value of 2*. 6d. per
yard, a bounty of 4s âAnd for every such piece
of the value of 3s. per yard, a bounty of 6s.â
In every cafe the cloth for which the bounty is
claimed, must have previouily deen fold to fbme
merchant residing in the Itate, at the above pri
ces, or higher.
Similar and indeed greater bounties should be
given on all woollen goods manufactured in this
ltace, and fold by the piece to the merchants for
retailingâThe reason is obviousâThe price of
flax and cotton in this country is as low, or even
lower than in Europe ; But their manufactories
have the advantage of machinery to expedite
labor which we lack. But as to wool, the cafc
is materially different ; that article is at least
doable the price here that it is in Englandâand
their workmen have the fame advantage over
ouvs in refpeft of machinery, as in the other
branchesâand also in refpetft of dye fluffs. It
is abfoiutely neceflary that we overcome all these
abltacles. Patience, patriotifin and perseverance,
with the aid of government, will soon effedt
what we wish. Let the monied man assist the
artisanâLet the wealthy farmer gi'e the manu
facturer p. reai'onable credit for his wool, that
the manufacturer, in turn, may give a reasona
ble credit to the merchant on his clothsâLet our
legislators, our judges, our councellors our at
tornies, and clergy (who should set a good ex
ample in this as in every other refpecft) be cloth
ed in the manufactures of the ltateâwe need
not fear that others will follow so laudable an
example âwe then {hall fee our villages well in
habited, and growing to the size of our largest
townsâour towns into cities, instead of their
dwindling into solitary places, and deserted vil
lages
1 am well aware that Biitifh merchants, Bri
tish agents, and all these Anglofied Americans
wno tui ii up their noses at every thing which is
not Bfiiifli, will effedt to turn my proje<Jts into
ridicule, and :reat the Patriot as a lunatic, or
at bed, jis a well meaning, but weak, visionary
projector. Yet setting aside their interested
viewsâwhy fliould they treat my projects with
contempt? No doubt the fitft attempts to esta
blish ilie woollen manufa<Aure in England was
as much decried. Their attempt to establish the
Cotton and Silk manufactures was more objedi
onable than an attempt of the fame kind would

be in this country, They have surmounted all
the obstacles that oppof'ed or impeded those
eftablifliments in that country ; and I have no
doubt we ihall finally surmount every obltacle
here. The more public or private encourage
ment is given our artisans and manufactures,
the sooner this great national object will be ef
fected. Maflachufetts has set us a good exam
pie in this refpecftâthey have given a bounty of
Bs. for every piece of duck manufactured in the
stateâthis has induced monied men to become
concerned in that business, and there is thebeft
grounds for believing the business will succeed ;
and be continued after the bounty shall cease.
They lw-ve lately made a very large donation to
the owners of the cotton manufactory, which
will probably induce them to pursue the under
taking with vigor. As our manufactures in
crease, heavy imports will doubtless be laid by
the general government on the importation of
foreign manufactures, which will operate as a
bounty on our own ; and will accelerate their
final eltablifhixenr, and bri-'g them to that state
of perfection as fiiall render all importations
needless.

O had I known it at an earlier hour,
I would have strove thy sorrows to relieve,
Have torn thee from the tyrant Sickness' power,
And bade thy aching breast delight receive.
I would have fat the lingering, painful, eve,
With various talk the lonely moments cheer'd ;
Have, with unwearied hand, thy head fuftain'd
Whole nights; and soothed thee as thou had'ft complain'd ;
And heal'd thee with affe&ion long ciidear'd.
for I have known the hand of hard disease;
Have felt opprefTive fickncfs at my foul ;
Seen dcaih-]:ke paleness o'er my features spread ;
And mark'd the life-fupporting current freeze,
t rorn hollow eyes, oi blue defps<r, the big tears roU â¢
And j ;in'd. in anguifh'd fancy, with the dead.
Yet then, even then, I cast a lingering look
On all the business of beloved mankind ;
While each adieu, each fond farewd, I took,
Still left a wish, for one more view, behind.
*Twas then new pleasures burst upon my mind,
New w)Qies agitated all my bteaft;
And hope, and paflion, and affettion, joio'd,
With life-reviving health again my bosom blefs'd.
Such are the joys I offer to thy view.
For what a greater iranfport can afford
Than to behold affeÂ£tion, virtue new,
And lovely goodness, o'er creation pourd ?
To fee refinement new-born raptures ihew ?
And happiness, by you, to earth restored ?
To fee the enchanting lmile
Of sweet benevolence expand,
And o'er the human face diffufe new light;
What hath such power affli&ion to beguile,
And foofche the woe-worn heart with comfort bland ?
What greater pleasure can the foul delight ?
To let imagination stray,
And wanton in celestial day;
To fee Creation's second birth,
And Heavefi, descending, blcfs the Earth ;
To view new beauty clothe the plain,
And rapture hail MÂ«fliah's reign ;
To mark death, anguish, and ciifeafe,
And vice, no more pollute the breeze;
To fee perfc&ion's glorious heirs,
Triumphant o'er life's little cares,

In God's felicity incieafe;
To love with frefher truth inclined ;
And gaining on the eternal Mind :
What nobler transports can the foul possess ?
What richer joy the sympathetic bosom bless ?

CODAND WHALE FISHERIES,
[CONTI NUED.]
ENGLAND is the market for the greater part of our spermaceti
oil. They impose on allour oils, a duty of eighteen pounds
five shillings sterling the ton, which, as to the common kind, is a
prohibition, as has been before observed, ard as tothat of the sper
maceti, gives a preference of theirs over outs to that amount, so
as to leave in the end, but a scanty benefit to the fifherman ; and
not long since, by a change of conftruÂ£tion, without any change
of the law, it was made to exclude our oils from their ports, when
carried in our own'vcflels. On some change of circumstance, it
was construed back again to the reception of our oils ; on paying
always, however, the fame duty of eighteen pounds five shillings.
This fervesto (hew that the tenure by which we hold the admis
sion of this commodity in their markets, is as precarious as it is
hard. Nor can it be announced that there is any disposition on

'heir part, to arrange this, or any other commercial matter, to mu
tual convenience. The exparte regulations which they have he
gun for mounting their navigation on the ruins of ours, nan only
_>e opposed by counter regulations on our part. And the loss of
seamen, the natural confequcnce of loft and obftruCled markets (or
our fifh and oil, calls in the firft place, for serious and timely at
tention. It will be too late when the seaman (hall have changed
his vocation, or gone over to another interest. If we cannot re
cover and secure for him these important branches of employ
ment, it behoves us to replace them by others equivalent. We
have three nurseries for forming seamen
1. Our coasting trade, already on a fafe footing.
2. Our fifheries, which in spite of natural advantages, give just
cause of anxiety. J
3. Our carrying trade, the only refonrce of indemnification for
what we lose in the other. The produce of the United States,
which is carried to foreign markets, is extremely bulky. That
part of it now in the hands of foreigners, and which we may re
sume into our own, without touching the rights of those nations
who have met us in fair arrangements by treaty, or the interests
of those, who, by their voluntary regulations, have paid so just and.
liberal a refpeft to our interests, as being measured back to them
again, places both parties on as good ground, perhaps, as treaties
could place them : the proportion, I fay, of our carrying trade,
which may be resumed without affecting either of these defcrip
tionsof nations, will find constant employment for ten thousand
Icamcn, be worth two millions of dollars annually, will go on
augmenting with the population of the United States, secure to us
a lull indemnification for the seamen we lose, and be taken wholly
from those who force us to this ast of felf-proteflion, in navigation.
Hence too would follow that their Newfoundland (hips, not re
ceiving provisions from us in their bottoms, nor permitted (by a
law of their own) to receive in ours, mail draw their fubfiltence
from Europe, which would increase that part of their expences
in the proportion of four to seven, and so far operate as a duty
towards rcftoring the level between them and us. The tables No.
2 and 12, will (hew the quantity of tonnage, and consequently
the mass of seamen whose interests are in distress ; and No. 17,
the materials for indemnification.
If regulations, exattly the counterpart of those established a
gainst us, would be ineffe&ual from a difference of circumftaices,
other regulations equivalent can give no reasonable ground of
complaint toany nation. Admitting their right of keeping their
markets to themselves, ours cannot be denied of keeping our
carrying trade to ourselves. And if there be any unfriend
ly in this, it was in the firft example.
Thelofs of seamen unnoticed, would be followed by othei los
ses in a long train. If we have no seamen, our ships will be use
less, consequently our (hip timber, iron and hemp ; our (hip-build
ing will be at an end, (hip-carpenters go over to other nations,
our young men have no call to the sea, our produce carried in fo
reign bottoms, be fadiled with warfreight and insurance in times
of war; and the history of the last one hundred years, shews that
the nation which is our carrier has three years of war for every
four years of peace. (No. 18) We lose, during the fame periods,
the carriage for belligerent powers, which the neutrality of our
flag would render an incalculable source of profit; we lose at this
moment the carriage of our own produce to the annual amount
of two millions of dollars, which in the poflible progress of the
encroachment, may extend to five or fix millions, the worth of
the whole, with an increase in the proportion of the increase of
our numbers. It is easier as well as better, to stop this train at its
entrance, than when it (hall have ruined or banilhed whole clafies
ofufeful and industrious citizens.
It will doubtless be thought expedient that the resumption fug
geftcd should take effett so gradually as not to endanger the loss of
produce for the want of transportation ; but that, in order to cre
ate transportation, the whole plan (hould be developed, and made
known at once, that the individuals who may be disposed to lay
themselves out for the carrying business may make their calcula
tions on a full view of all circumltances.
On the whole, the historical view we have taken of these fifti
enes provts they arc so poor in themselves as to come to nothing
with distant nations, who do not support them from their trca
furies. We have seen that the advantages of our pcfition place our
fifheries on a ground lomewhat higher, such as to relieve our trea
sury from the neceflity of giving them support, but not to permit
it to draw support from them, nor to dispense the government
from the obligation of effectuating free markets for them, that for
the great proportion ofour salted fifh, for our common oil, and a
part ot our fpermacani oil, markets may perhaps, be prefeived by
friendly arrangememstowards those nations whose arrangements
are friendly to us, and the rcfidue be compeni'ated by giving to
the seamen thrown out of business the certainty of employment in
another branch of which we have the sole disposal.

NEW-YORK, April 30,
The present Empress of Rulfia, born in the year
1729, was a German Princefc, daughter of Chril
tian Augustus, Prince of Anbalt Zereft, and in
174J, married Peter the Illd. a Sovereign diitin
gui(hed for his folly and vices, who after his
ascending the throne was weak enough to wear
the Prussian Uniform, profefs himfelf a soldier
of Frederick (the public enemy of his country)
attempted to cut the beards of his Clergy, and
was the avowed foe of literary improvement.
After a turbulent reign of about fix months, he
was deposed by the united concurrence of hit
fubje<ftsâwho, in July, 1762, bellowed the Dia
dem upon liis wife, the present Empress, who
then changed her name of Sophia Augnfta for
that of Catharine Alegriewna the second. She
is, undoubtedly, very ambitious; but excepting
the great Leopold, is the firft Legislator of the
present age; the protestor of her people, iu re
lieving the miseries of her pealants; and has by
a series of mod brilliant achievements and afto-
nifhing fuccefles, raifod the Ruffian Empire to a
height of glory, which now threatens to overturn
the balance of Europe.

But there may be ten borrowers, and but one lend

ALBANY, May 9.
Nearly two centuries have revolved since tne
fir ft foundation of this city.âThe pursuits of itÂ®
inhabitants have heretofore been partial ami o
ral Had the firft settlers implanted with tliem
selves tliofe feeds of ente "prize and accomm" 1
tion to all nations and fec'ts that diftingii'' e
the founders of Philadelphia in 1681, we 'I* oll 'at this time doubtless rank in the firft class of ci
ties in America. In the course of the present
futnmer, we ihould fee the while length of Mar-
Jcet-rtreet completely paredâwith fide walksâa
commodious market houseâa spacious prison ;
and if we are rightly informed, the docks raised,
with a fair prot'pecft of the introduction of fo
reign commerce. Private convenience begins to
give way to public good, and a fpiric of im
provement has taken root beyond all former ex
amples. We presume we are principally indebt

ed corporation, as well as the decisive character
of our present chief magistrate for these benefits.
BENNINGTON, May 9.
The number of the Indians on the continent,
like the extensive circuit of a comet, leads the
attentive mind to conceive almost an immeasur
able scope of country poflefied by them. The
belt informed persons suppose, that there are
more than three aboriginals, in America, to one
white man.
This liypothefis has been disputed by some,
who argue, that from the scattered Hate in wlii ch
they live, the country could not contain them :
but when we consider that it is but a few years
lince the Spaniards firft invaded South-America,
at which period, Montezuma was said to have
30 Kings at his beck, each of whom could turn
out 100,000 fighting menâand take into view
the trifling extent of their territory, compared
â with the alinoft unlimited western wilds, the mind
is swallowed up in wonder, and loft in uncer
tain coaje&ure
No part of the world, it is said, has been dis
covered to be fertile and advantageous for the
residence of man, but man has been found to in
habit it. If this be true, the idea, perhaps, will
not be deemed altogether chimerical, that the
more western parts of this continent, are at pre
sent pofleiied by nations,
Where other Montezuma's hold their reign,
And peaceful millions till the fertile plain:
Where arts, perhaps, to Europe's lons unknown,
Present their charmsâand wisdom, all their own,
Guide them along, secure from foreign jars-
Internal discord, or deftruftive wars.
SALEM, May 10.
Cape, Stone, on his pafl'age lately from Port

on board which was a Capt. Bofwell and his crew,
who belonged to R. Island, and had been taken
from a brig which had been wrecked in a severe
gale of wind : She was on the point of linking,
when the Spaniard came to their relief.âCapt.
Bofwell and his men were received on board
Capt. Stone's velfel, and brought to Portland.
The Spaniih Captain, at parting, supplied them
amply with provifionsand water âGenerous man !

HARTFORD, May 16.
A Correspondent has sent us the following account of the pro
ceedings at the late Ele&ion.
On Wednesday in the afternoon, Major Caldwell's company of
horse, well mounted and equipped, met his Excellency the Go
vernor at Wethersfield, and escorted him to this town, preceeded
bv the Sheriffs of the fcveral counties on horseback
On Thursday, the day of the Election, the guards under the
command of Capt. Hopkins, paraded at the usual hour, and con
duced the Governor and Council to the State-House, from
â which the proceflion was to move. Here the Guards were }oined
by the Horse. Jufl before n o'clock, the proceflion moved ftfom
the State-House to the North-Church, headed by the Sheriffs,
â with their deputies and the constables of the town with their
staves of office. Next followed the Governor, the Lieut. Go
vernor and Council, the Reprefentativcs and Clergy. The pro
ceflion was uncommonly large, which, with the order, discipline,
and martial appearance of the guards added splendor to the ex
hibition.
Every part of divine service was performed to good accept
ance, but the sermon delivered by the Rev. Dr. Dwight, of
Greenfield, deserves particular commendation. Piety of thought,
clothed with elegance of style, and expressed with energy and
precision, compol'ed the foul of this discourse ; and the listening
multitudes which crowded the church, which were called toge
ther by the reputation of the preacher, declared their utmost ex
pectations gratified. The service was closed with an anthem, set
by the Do&oi hiinfelf to the g2d psalm.
After service, the proceflion moved back to the State Houfc, at
tended by a more numerous collection of people than has been seen
on the like occasion for many years.
The day was very pleasant, and the citizens of Hartford, throw
ing open thedoors of hospitality, and spreading well drefied tables
for the entertainment of their brethren, contributed to enliven the
enjoyment of this anniversary.
In the evening, a fplcndid ball was given ; attended by a nu
merous collcttion of ladies and gentlemen, both strangers and ci-.
tizens.
In the afternoon, an Oration was delivered by Zephaniah
Swift, Esq. before the Society instituted for the purpole of abo
-1 idling slavery, and relieving luch Africans as may need protec
tion and afliftance. On this occasion, a numerous concourf" o'
people attended, who were agreeably entertained ar.d inftruficd
by a difcriptive history of slavery, and the miseries it has entaiied
upon a part of the human race from the ear licit ages to this time.

FROM THE FEDERAL GAZETTE.
To the Memory of FRANCIS HOPKINSON, Esq.
S WEET Spring advance and deck with flow'rets gay,
The tomb where Hopkinson's remains aic laid,
Ye muses there your constant vigils pay,
And guard from ills the confecmed shade.
Ye city trees protett your patron's grave,
He once from ruin fav'd your leafy charms, j?
Then to his honor, bid your green tops wave,
And fold his urn in your embracing arms.
Around the sod may roses ever bloom,
And lilies pour their aromatic tide,
There oft the lyre th' elegiac task afTume,
And notes like his be ofFer'd at his fide.
Notes such as once he pour'd at Bremner's urn,
Lays such as those he offer'd at his shrine,
But ah, what muse can make a just return,
For lays so mournful, or a note so fine!
Loft to his country is that sprightly vein,
That attic wit that grae'd his claflic pen,
He now aflumes a more exalted strain,
And quits for angels the pursuits of men.
In those bright realms where patriot shades repofo,
He joins his Franklin, gone not long before;
There nature all her mystic wonders fliews,
There opens all her variegated flore.
From those high orbs he fees with rapture rife,
The Roof he labor'd when on earth t' crett,
And as its turrets reach their deftin'd flues,
His guardian genius (hall the frame protest.
Adieu, sweet bard, long may thy mem'ry live,
Thy country, grateful, long thy rr.Orits own,
This artless verse is all a friend can give,
'Tis for that country to ere&lhe (tone.
[TO the above Poem it v may not be amifsto add, for the infor
mation of those residing at a distance who may fee it, and be unac
quainted with the fubjeÂ£l of it, the late ingenious ]udge Hopki n
son, that at one time the many beautiful and verdant trees, orna
menting Philadelphia, were threatened with deftruttion by a leÂ«
giflative ast, to prevent, as it was. (aid, danger from fire, and a ftag
nationofair: It was then the vivacious Mr. Hopki n con gave
new life to the trees, by exploding the ridiculous obje&ioas made 1
to them, in a speech of a Pillar in the House of Affembty to the
Legislature of the State, which was so luecefsful as to pufl a total
stop to a measure, that would have been deemed a profatation of
the rights of many of the Sylvan Deities under the Heathen My
thology, and which, had it succeeded, would have deprived Phi
ladelphia of many an agreeable and (hady walk, and of much of
its present ftatelinefs and beauty. Mr. Bremner a Musi
cian of great eminence, and a gentleman of much social merit, for
merly residing in Philadelphia, to whose memory Mr. Hdpkin
son composed a very pathetic and foft Dirge, to the tune of %< The
Lassos Peatie's Mill: Thishefet to music, and performed with
admirable taftc and force of exprefiion on the Harpfichorcl: Mr.
Hopki n son, now claims, alas \ but claims in vain v a tributfe from
the Muses, of equal elegance : It is not often that a genius like
Bremner's, finds an eulogist like Hopkinson ! The New
Roof, hislaft celebrated performance, was in defence of our pte
fent excellent frame of government, which he had vervjuftlv com
pared to a great Cupola or Dome, supported by the Staies, as by
so many Pillars, and yielding to all an equal and efficient protec
tion. It is only necessary to add, that Mr. Hopki nson was
the intimate friend, and one of the teflamentary executors of the
Great Frank li n âwith whom he had often indulged those phi
iofophical researches and enquiries into the operations Of nature,
which now, it is probable, in a Superior State, are fully gratified
and elucidated, as a jufland proper retribution for their industry
and zeal in the pursuit of ufeful discoveries, while bounds a by the
veil of our present mortal infirmities and imperfections. 1

The refpcÂ£lful and affettionate attention to our beloved Chief
Magistrate, exhibited by the citizens of thefouthern States,evinces
how greatly gratified they are by tnevifit he has made them âand
forcibly linprelTas the mind with a sense of their cordial attachment
to the government over which he presidesâand the polwy and ur
banity of the arduous tour he has undertaken. âThe animated
and patriotic addrelTes, presented by the cities, towns and corpor
ations, {hall appear in course in the Gazette of the United State*.
A Constitution, framed by the People, is always ti - palladi
um of their liberty, and if at any period it becomes useless, or
worse than useless, or appears so to the People, the People,
have a right to modify itâto annihilate it, if they plea â¢ :âWhy
then talk of certain fixed principles in a Constitution âthere is
but one fixed principle. A Constitution (houJd always be the
work of the People, and framed for the advantage of the go
verned ; every other principle is subordinate and may be changed
or modified when and as often as a majority of that People
think fit. Gen. Advertrfer.
The above gave rife to the following paragraphs
from a correspondent :âThe idea of fixed prin
ciples in morals is almost obfolerein the opinion,
and agreeable to the practice of many moderns ;
but this only indicates the low ebb of virtueâthe
tide will rife againâfor truth, which forms the
basis of morals, is immutable.
Man has certain unalienable rightsâfay tliefe
depend on the opinion of the majority, and you
arm despotism with the moll deflrudtive powersâ
lor it has never yet been determined with uiiiver
fal, or evenÂ£v>/t;r<7/confent, what are prescriptive,
or imprefcriptive rights : The fccurity of the li
berties of tliefe States depends on a sacred regard
to that Constitution which defines their rights :
27
The eligibility of our situation arises from this
idea alone, that the people have agreed on certain
fixed principles \n governmentâbut, if there are
no fixed principles, and we mud be perpetually
afloat, this world may do for those that love to filh
in troubled waters âbut as to peace or permanen
cy in existence, or governmentâor security to
freedom, person or property, they are all entire
ly out of the question.
It would be ufefulto determine, with fomede
gree of precision, what is meant by the majority's
having a right to modify, or annihilate their con
stitution, whenever they think fit: Itfeemsto
convey this idea, That one million and one citi
zens, fhallpoflefs the power whenever they think
fit to exercise it, to annihilate the rights of oaÂ«
million fellow-citizens.
America foughtfor herprefentgloriousConfti
tutionâand those who conducted her Councils
andherarms, inthedaysofdoubtful expectation
are among the warmett friends to this Constitu
tionâ" The die long spun doubtful," whether
anarchy and disgrace; or government and honor
were to crown our labors : Having secured the
latter, the idea, that we have agreed on no fixed
principles, must make us pause in anguiflj.

For erefling BRIDGES over the Hackinsack and Passaicak
Rivers, between Powlas-Hook and Newark, in the State of
New-Jersey.
THE Commiflioners appointed by an aÂ£t of the legislature of
the state of New-Jersey, to ereÂ£l bridges over the Hackinfack
and Paffaiack rivers, having obtained the neccffary surveys, are
now ready to receive proposals for performing the fame ; and
offer the following conditions for theconfiderationof such as may
be inclined to contrast :
(96 tf)
The situation of the bridge across the Hackinfack river, will be
at one of the following stations, as shall be hereafter determined
most eligible.
lft. At the place where the present ferry is established, where
the width of the river is 1448 feet.
Depth at the eastern fliore, 8 feet 8 inches.
Do. western shore, 8 11
Greatest depth, 25 4

the width of the river is 676 feet.
Depth at the eastern shore 8 feet 6 inches,

Greatest depth 15 n
The bridges are to be conftrutted on the principles of those erect
ed over Charles, Myftick, and Beverly Rivers in the State of Mas
sachusetts, with a draw to admit a free passage for vessels with fix
ed standing masts, not less than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as shall be determined most con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks on
each fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid vessels in parting through. Also, one lamp on each fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during
the continuance of the lease.
The bridget ate to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as {hall render them perfectly fubftanlial and secure in
the opinion of the commiflioners, and are to be of a fufficient
height to protest them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at spring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Dollars
Allowance tor cairiagc way, 20 feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on each fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet,
Do. for balluftrades, 1 foot each, 2 feet.
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluftrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Boston and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept Â»n constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be surrendered in good order,
agreeably to the atl.
The following are the terms which the commiflioners are au
thorised to offer to contrattors :
A lease of the exclusive privilege of the bridges for a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the prc
fent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an eflimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
actual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years last past,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jersey currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will confcquently produce an
immediate income of 900 pounds per ann. This mav fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftruftion of these bridges will give to travel
ling, the easy communication thereby offered with the state of
New-York, on the western fide of the Hudson, are all important
circumstances, which must neceflarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads connected
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the places shall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the cpntratts for etetting them are oxccuted,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as maybe inclined to contrast on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from this date, to William Maxwell,
Esq. in New-York, fpccifying the shortest period of lease for
which they will undertake to ere& the laid bridges, together with
proper security for performing the fame.
