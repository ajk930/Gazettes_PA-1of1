GENERAL SCOTT.
ExtraSl of a Letter from. Brigadier General Charles Scott, to the Secre
tary Jor the Department of War, dated Lexington, the 20 th of June,
1791, âreceived by Lieutenant Belli, who arrived in town on Tuejduy
lajlyfrom the Wejlern Country.
*' T N prosecution of the enterpi ife, I marched four miles from
X the banks of the Ohio on the 23d oi May, and on the 241b
I relumed my maich, arÂ»d puflied forward with the utmost in
duitry, dire&ing my route to Ouiattanan, in the belt manner my
guides, and information, enabled me, though I found myielf
greatly deficient in both.
" By the 31ft, I had marched one hundied and thirty-five
miles, over a country cut by four large branches of White River,
and many smaller itreams, with steep muddy banks : During this
march, I traverfea a countr) alternately interspersed with the
moil luxuriant foil, and deep clayey'bogs, from one to five miles
â wide, rendered almofl impervious by brush and briars. Rain
icll in torrents every day, with frequent blafls of wind and thun
der itorms. These obflacles impeded my progress, wore down
iny horl'es, and dellroycd my provisions.
On the morning of the lit inft. as the array entered an ex
tensive prairie, 1 pcrceived an Indian on horfeback,a few miles to
the right : I immediately made a detachment to intercept Inm,
but lie escaped. Finding myfelf difcovercd, I determined to ad
vance with all the rapidity my circumstances would permit, ra
ther with the hope than the expectation of reaching the object
iought that day ; tor my guides were (hangers to the couiury
which 1 occupicd. At 1 o'clock, having marched by computati
on one hundred and fifty-five miles from the Ohio, as I penetrat
ed a grove, whieh bordered on an cxtenfive prairie, 1 difeovered
two imall villages at my left, at two diid four miles distance.
" My guides now recognized the ground, and informed me
that the main town was tour or five miles in my front, behind a
point of wood which jutted into the prairie. I immediately de
tached Col. John Hardin, with sixty mounted infantry, and a
Â»oop of light horl'c, under Capt. M'Coy, to attack the villages to
the left, and moved on b.rifkty, with my main body, in order of
battle, towards the town, the imoke from which was discernible.
My guides were deceived with itip*.6l to the lituation of the town ;
tor iuflead of (lauding at the edge of the plain, through which I
marched, I found it on the low ground bordering on theWabafh ;
on turning the point of woods, one house prefeuted in my front.
Capt. Price was o>deied to afldultthat with lorty men : He exe
cuted the command with great gallantry, and killed two "warri
ors. When I gain.d the summit of the eminence which over
looks the villages on the banks of the Wabalh, 1 dilcovered the
enemy m great confufion, endeavoring to make their escape over
the river in canoes. 1 inltantly ordered LicutcnanUColoncl Com
mandant Wilkinfon toiufh forward with the firft battalion : the
order was ex cu ed with promptitude, and this detachment gain
ed the bank or the river just as the rear of the enemy had embark
ed : And regardless of a brisk lire kept up from a Kickapoo
Town, on the oppofne bank, they in a few minutes, by a well di
rected fire from their rifL-s, deflroyed a.l the Savages with which
live canoes were crouded.
" To my great mortification the Wabafh was many feet be
yond fording at this place. I therefore detached Colonel Wilkin
lOQ to a ford two miles above, which my guides informed m<?,
was more pia&cable.
44 The enemy itill kept poflcflion of the Kickapoo Town. I
determined to dislodge them, and for the purpose ordered Cap
tauis King's and Longldon's companies to march down the river,
below the town, and cross under the conduct of Major Barbcc :
Several of the men swam the river, and others paflfed in a small
canoe. This movement was unobfeivcd, and my men had taken
poll on the bank belore they were discovered by the enem), who
immediately abandoned the village.âAbout this time word was
brought me, that Col. Hardin was incumbered with prisoners,
snd had discovered a llronger village further to my left, than
ihofe I had observed, which he was proceeding to attack. I im
mediately detached Captain Brown with his company, to support
the Colonel; but the diftande being fix miles, before the Captain
arrived the bufincfs was done, and Colonel Hardin joined me a
little before funlet, having killed fix warriors and taken fifty-two
prisoners. Captain Bull, the warrior who discovered me in the
morning, had gained the main town and given the alarm a fliort
tune before 111 c ; bu: the villages to my left were uninformed of
my approach and had no retreat. The next mouiing I determin
to ditach my Lieut.Col. Commandant with five hundred men,
tocku.ov the unporuiu lowu of Kethlipecanunk., at the mo.ith
c m,l s homin y cym P* a "d on the weft fide
ot the \\ abalh : But on examination I discovered my men and
horses to be crippied & so worn down by a long,laborious nwrch,
*ud the attivc exertions ot the preceding day ; that three hundred 1
-nd lixty men only couid be found in capacity to undertake the
cnterprife, and they picpaicd io march on foot.
" Colonel Wtlkinfon marched wiih this detachment at half af
ter fnc ill the evening, and returned to iny camp the next day at
one o'clock, having marched thiity-fix miles in' twelve hours, and
ueftroyed tiie mÂ«ft important settlement of the enemy in that quar
ter of the federal territory : In No. 3 you will find the colonel's
ueport rcipe&iwg the tnicrprifc.
" Many of the inhabitants of this village were French, and liv
ed in o ftaic ot civilization : by the books, tetters and other docu
ments found therr,it is evident, that place was in close connection
with, and dependant oh Detroit ; a large quantity of coin, a vari
ety of hcuthold goods, peltry and other articles were burned with
this village ; which coufiftcd ol about 70 houses, many ot them
veil finifhed.
** the objett of a white flag, which appeared
on an eminence oppofitt tto me in the afternoon of the firfi, I Jibe
rated an aged squaw and fant with tier a nuffage to the bavapes,
mat 11 they would come in and furrcnucr, then towns (hould be
ipand and they should icceive good treatment. [It was after
wards found that this white flag was not intended as a signal of
I* a 11 y ; but waÂ« placed there to mat k the spot where a ptifon ot
ciftin&iou ainou# the Irulians, who had died foine time before,
was inteileei.J On tli*: I detci inifccd to difchaigc 16 of the
veakeii and moll infirm of my pri loners, with a talk to the Wa

brance, to gtatiiy the iuipulfioiis of humanity, to incrcafe the pa

Saturday, July 50, 175)1.
fclf these obje&s will juflify my conduct, and secure the approba
tion of my country.
" Ou the fame day, after having burned the towns and adjacent
villages, and destroyed the growing corn ana pulse, I began my
march, for the rapids of the Ohio, where I arrived the 14th inft.
without the loss of a Tingle man by the enemy, and hve only
wounded, having killed thirty-iwo, chiefly warriors of lize and
figure, and taken fifty-eight prifoneis.
44 it is with much pride and pleasure I mention, that noaÂ£lof
inhumanity, has marked tlie couduÂ£l of the volunteers of Kentuc
ky on this occasion, even the lhveierated habit of scalping the
dead, ceafedto influence.
" I have delivered forty-one prifonersto Capt. Afheton of the
firft United States' regimcflt at Fort Steuben.
44 I sincerely lament, that the weather and the consequences it
produced, rendered it impoflible for Mieto carry terror and defoÂ«
lation to the head of the Wabalh.âThe corps I had the honor to
command, was equal to the objeÂ£l, but the condition of my horses
and (late of my provifious, were mfiiperable obstacles to my own
intentions', and the Wifhesof all.
'â¢ It would "be invidious to make diftiriftions in a corps which
appeared to be animated with one foul, and where a competition
lor danger and for glory, inspired all ranks.
" I however, consider it my duty to mention, Colonel John
Hardtn, who, in the chara6ler of a volunteer, without commis
sion, had command of my advance party, and the direction ot
my guides from the Ohio River, ior the difcernmeni, courage
and ufchvity with which he fulfilled the trufl I repoTed in him.â
And I cannot close this letter in justice to the merits of General
Wilkmfon, who went out my Lieu enant-Colonel Commandant,
without acknowledging my obligations for the faithful discharge
of the several duties depending on him, and the able support
which he gave me in every exigency."
General Wilkinson's Report.
S 1 R,
THE detachment under my command, deflined to attack the
village Kethlipecanunk, wasput in motion at half after five o'clock
lad evening. Knowing thai an enemy whose chief iependenca is
in his dexterity 3s a marksman, and alertness ifc coveiing himfelf
behind trees, flumps, and other impediments to fair fight, would
not hazard an altion in the light, I determined to push my march
until I appioached the vicinity of the villages where I knew the
country to be champaigrte. I gained my point without a halt,
twenty minutes before eleven o'clock; lay upon my arms until
(our o'clock, and half an hour after assaulted the town at all quar
ters. The enemy was vigilant, gase way on my approach., and
in canoes trolled Eel Creek, which washed. the North Eail part
of the town âThat creek was not fordable. My corps daftied
forward with the irnpetuofity becoming volunteers, and were sa
luted by the enemy with a brisk fire from the opposite fid-e of
the creek. Dauntless they rallied on tÂ© the water's edge, unco
vered, to the Moccaion, and finding it impafTable, returned a
volley, which so galled and disconcerted their antagonifls, that
they threw away their fire without effect. In five minutes the
Indians were driven from the covering, and fled witn precipita
tion, I have thiee men slightly wounded. At half past five the
town was inflame*, and ai fix o'clock I commenced my retreat.
I want language to do justice to the courage and good conduct
of the gentlemen who cojnpofed my dctachmcnt; in neither could
they be exceeded by veteran troops.

To the various Tribes of the Peankafhaws, and all the Nations of
Red People, living on the waters of the Wabalh River.
THE Sovereign Council ot the Thirteen United States, have
long patiently borne your depredations againli- their fettle
inents on this fide of the great mountains, in hope th3t you would
fee your error, and correal it, by entering into bonds of amity
and lasting"peace. Moved by companion, and pitying your mil
guided councils, they have frequently addrefiTed you on this lub
jcd, but without effect. At length their patience is exhausted,
an 4 they have stretched forth the arm of power against you
Their mighty sons and chief warriors have at length taken up the
hatchet; they have penetrated far into your country, to meet your
warriors, and punish them for their tranfgreflions. But you fled
before them, and declined the battle, leaving youi wives and
childien to their mercy. They have destroyed your old town,
Ouiattanan, and the neigbouring villages, and have taken many
prifojiers. Resting here two days, to g : ve you time to colled
your strength, they have proceeded to your town of Kethlipeca
nunk; but you again fled before them ; and that great town has
been destroyed. After giving you this evidence of their power,
they have Hopped their hands, because they are as merciful as
strong, and they again indulge the hope, that you will come to a
sense of yourtru interest, and determine to make a lasting peace
with them and all their children forever. The United States ha?e
no desire to destroy the Red People, although they have thepow
ei ; l>ul should you decline this invitation, and eurfucyour i*n
provoked hofli 1 ilies, their strength will again be exerted againit
you, your warriois will be flaughtefed, your towns and villages
ransacked and defiioyed, your wives and children carried into
captivity, and you may be afTured, that those who escape the fury
of our mighty chiefs, shall find no resting place oo this fide the
Gieat Lakes. The warriors of the United States wilh not to
diftrels or destroy women and cjiildien or old men, aÂ«d although
policy obliges them to retain some in captivity, yet companion
and humanity have induced them to let others at liberty, who
will deliver you this talk. Thole who are cairied off will be left
in the care of our great chief and warrior General St. Clair, near
'he mouth of Miami and opposite to the Licking River, where
hey will be treated with humanity and lendernefs; if you wifli
to recover them, repair to that place by the firft day of July next;
determined with truehraitsto bury the hatchet, and linoke the
pipeol peace, they will then be uftorcd to you, and you may
agÂ»Â»n let dov\n in security at your old towns, and live in peaai
and happiness; unmolested by the people <4 the United Sfates,
who will become your inends and prote&ois, and will be ready
to lurnifli vou with all the neceffai ies you may require. But (hould
you foolifhly peifift in your warfare', the sons of war will be let
loose againli you, and the hatchet will never be buried until your
coentry is defohted, and your people humbled to the dust.

MR. FEN NO,
A Writer in the Columbian Centinel, unfertile
signature of Publicola, appears to have
excited a neit of hornets, which are continually
buzzing about his head ; but very fortunately
they are a new species, aud upon examination
are found to bte destitute of ftjngs. The princi
ples and lentiments contained in those publica
tions, are censured by people from no other mo
tive than the idea of rendering their writings of
more consequence, by circulating the opinion
that they are answering the Vice-President of
the United Staresâno other confideratioit could
make these writers of the fmallell importance.
Their object is evident, but their aflertions falfe i
for I can from the belt authority allure them, that
the Vice-President is not the author of those
pieces. But supposing liim the real author, I
will venture to allert, from an attentive perusal,
thar there is not as yet in any one of them a fen
tiinenc which can jultify the charges of aristo
cracy so liberally bellowed, or in the fmalleit
degree infringe the liberties of die people. The
good sense of the people of this country will lead
them to read and judge for themselves ; nor are
their bed, their firmed and most .independent:
friends, to be hunted down at the found of a
word. Years of experience will not be loft or
rendered ineffectual by the clamour of a thoafand
scribblers fucli as have hitherto appeared.

THE late Rqy. Dr. Lockwood, of Andover, in
Connecticut, who died a few years part, at the
Pool in New Lebanon, State of New-York, in
liis lad will and testament, left a legacy tt> Yale
College, the place of his education, to the amount
of between thiee and four hundred pounds, the
intereil of which is to be annually applied to
making additions to the College Library.
A very laudable and judicious inltance of bene
ficence ! The fame gentleman, two or three years
since, made-a donation of one hundred
upon condition that other friends of literature
would augment the fubfeription to three hundred,
pounds, for the pnrpofe of procuring an additi
onal philosophical apparatus for that College;
which was acÂ«ordiÂ»ugly done. Such benefacftors
of literary initiations deserve the gratitude of

ON HEARING A PARTRIDGE DRUM
Wiittln by a gentleman of St. Johnsbury (Vermont.)
HARK \ whepce that hollow found which strikes the ear,
Ai.d fills the mind with rude alarm,
As I walk forth to view the blooming year,
And unfufpe&ing harm ?
'Tis not the found of violence and arms,
'Tis not to rouse the din of war,
'Tis love the gentle drummer's bosom warms,
And wakensall his care.
The woodland Partridge 'tis, by nature taught,
For double purpose makes the found,
'Reft of his mate ! âto banish anxious thought,
And fray intruders round.
On a fall'n tree he takes his centry-ftand ;
Near whe r e his mate upon her ncft
Sils broodingâand with trembling pinions fann'd,
Beats air upon his bread.
In all her painful abstinence he fares,
Hoping to lee the callow young ;
With her in all solicitudes he (hares,
Nor thinks the season loAg.
Does nature plant this inftinft in his mind,
And useless there to all beside ?
Not soâall creatures reason's search will find,
In ufefulnefs allied.
Wisdom examples gives, by brutes and bird?,
To man.âHer pupils here may learn,
(Altho' not drefs'd :n founding pomp of words)
And ufeful truth discern.
She bids the fire the teeming matron tend
With ch arful will to eafc her mind,
The sympathizing and protc&ing friend,
Affe&ionate and kind.
Alas! how few attend her hallow'd lore,
But coldly stray, whilst rending woes r
Tear a fond mother's tender bosom more
Than double all her throws.
" Shame burn his cheeks to cinder," who thus dares
Infringe on nature's sacred code ;
For whom awaits, âtho prefcnt mercy spares,â
The wrath of nature's GOD.

MESSAGE FROM THE LORDS
s up p l r.
The House resolved itfelf into a committee of
Supply.
1 lie Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed the
Relolution, '' That iiis Majesty should grant out
of the Conlolated Fund, a sum not exceeding
[2,0001. as an annuity to the Duke of Clarence.
Mr. t rancis alked what saving had accruec
from the death of the Duke of Cumberland.
Mr. Powys said, in the provision granted to
his Majesty by the Civil Lilt, the re was a pro
fpeclive view to what his family might be at a
future period.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated the
great increase of expence, and the reluctance of
Ins Ma jelly to exceed the sum granted in the Ci
vil Lift.
Mr. Baker stated how unpleafanc it was in cer
tain circuin(lances to make any opposition to a
resolution of this fort, especially in the present
in fiance, when the provision was for a juung
Prince, who had received a regular education it
the f avoi ,te service of this country, and to whom
we were taught by anticipation to look forward
with the most flattering hopes. He stated the
v . nicreafe of the cxpences of the Civil Lift
within these five years, Tome of the articles of
winch he thought required explanation, fnftead
>t making such resolutions things of course if
900.0001. was fufficient for the expence of 'the
â¢"iv L,ft > 't would be better at once to augment
it to one million. 6
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said it was
by no means intended that such resolutions fhouid
be things of course. The sum of 34,0001. was

Mr. President,
THE Univerfny in which you preside (hinds
among the highest marks of the wisdom and pa
triotism of our ancestors ; âthe men who fled to
the wilderness rather than to partake of careless
ease and splendid pleasures in a state of slavery,
gave birth to this institution. '
While this anniversary serves as a memorial
of rheir extraordinary virtuÂ«s,.it enibeliilhes the
path of science, cherishes literature, and pro
motes the interest of our republic.
The exhibitions of this day evince to us the
great abilities you pofl'efs, Sir, and the careful
attention you pay to the duties of your impor
tant station ; and they also reflect 111 jch honor
upon all the immediate Governors of the Uni
versity.
The young gentlemen who have 011 this occa
sion given such ample proof of their genius a;id
application, have raised p3 to great expe&ations
of their future ufefulnefs : our best wishes accom
pany them i nto the world, and our ardent prayer
is, that they may serve and honor their country.
When we recolletft the wifhesof the venerable
founders of this seminary, we feel the inolt in
tereltirig hopes that there will forever proceed
from this place, men, whole virtues, vvifdom and
learning, will lead our enlightened and grateful
people in the ways of religion and patriotism.
It is with you, young gentlemen, who now
have your residence within Harvard's Walls, to
add lustre to the brightness of your country, or
to check her progress in glory with an interval
of darkness We wilh to inspire your ambition
with this idea, and to incite yon by a sense of
your importance in the community, to an exalt
ed nude of conduct.âSuffer 11s to do this, and
we shall rejoice in the honorableprefagesofyour
f uture greatness.
While this University, refpecHrable Sir, conti
nues to support such a reputation as it has always
enjoyed, and as the exhibitions of this day have
proved to be ju(t, it will merit and receive the
patronage and support of every man who loves
his country, and is concerned for its inrerefts.
The Gentlemen concerned in its inftruiftion, ren
der a mod important service to the community;
they form the minds and manners of its future
members, and give a complexion to those who
are hereafter to govern it. From the Public then,
from the Civil Fathers of their country, from the
Patriots, the of Maflachufetts; Har
vard College mufl receive countenance, encou
ragement and assistance. While the blood of
their venerable ancestors warms theirveins, while
the independence, the freedom and happiness of
America are dear to .her sons, this University
cannot be deserted. nor its faithful servants lejt
without a support.
To the protection and favour of the God of
the Spirits of all flefh, the God of our fathers, to
the patronage and assistance of all those who va
lue the happiness of posterity, and wish their
Freedom, we commend this venerable Seat of
Science.âMay it flourish and increaseâmay it
bless America and the World, so long as the Suu
and Moon shall endure.

In palling 9. very high bridge within this allf
trid: the lalt week, one of the Hon. Judges of the
Supreme Judicial Court was in the utmost dan
ger of losing his lifeâHis horse starting a little,
and there being no kind of railing or guard on
the fides of the bridge, the wheels of his carriage
â were carried over, and nothing but a very Hidden
exertion faxed him from absolute deltrucftion.
It is hoped that this accident will lead Surveyors
and Grandjuryinen to attend strictly to their
duty.
FROM A CORRESPONDENT
Much has been faicl concerning the building
of bridges, and cutting canals, &c. but little feetns
to be said concerning the opening a Canal from
Lake Sebago, into Prefumfcot River, and thereby
effetft an inland navigation of more than 50 miles
into the heart ot the countryâwhich may be
done by digging the small distance of 16 or 20
rods. It can scarcely be conceived whatafource
of traffic this would open betwegn the inhabitants
of this town and the inland country. Fonrtown-
Ihips alrnolt filled with inhabitants compose the
shores of this lake, lmmenfe forefts of Oak and
Pine Timber are planted by the foltering hand
of nature around the extensive (hores of Sebago
âadd to this, many towns hrvve considerable
quantities ot the various articles produced 011
their farms to transport to this market, and front
thence such commodities as they fliould need in
exchange back again, which might be done with
one quarter the expence by water.
SPRINGFIELD, JULY 20.
During the severe thunder florin, 011 Wednes
day lall, the lightning (truck in the yard of Cap
tain John Bryant, of this town, and took its
direction to the cellar window, which it entered,
and lighting on a calk of rum, forced out <>nc of
the heads, and set the rum on fire, which raged
in such a manner, as to fire every thing of 0
combustible nature, almofl in an inflant; but by
the (eafonable exertions of the family, and othc's
who went to their afiiftance, the fire was happily
extinguished.
POUGHKEEPSIE, JULY2I
Lad Saturday afternoon, Captain Mott of this
place, being on his return with his sloop fron
New-York, was overtaken by a thunder squall
about 20 miles this fide the city.âThe lightning
forfome time was very severe, with a heavy rain,
during which, the vefl'el was (truck by the light
ning, and so damaged, as to oblige his return to
Mew-York to repair. It is said it firft flruck the
lop-mafi, and descended till it came to the jib
ftay, where it divided, one part running down
the mad, and the other down the jib-stay to the
end of the bowsprit, and from that to the (Vein,
which it split iu several places to the water's edge,
â and to prevent the water running into her, was
obliged to (tick in oakum, &c. The jib-stay was
so burnt, that it broke near the middle. The
lightning is supposed to have gone off the veflel
by the anchor, which was so burnt, as to take
the rust entirely oft, and appeared like a new one
just out of the forge.
PROVIDENCE, July 21
The rapidity with which the subscription to
the Bank of the United States was filled, proves
that the wealth of this country is much bevond
what has been generally supposed, and that the
fame enlightened and magnanimous policy that
established the present happy constitution of the
government of our country, which has so highly
railed our national reputation, in the efteern of
the world at large,now continues to beautify and
strengthen the magnificent fabric, and to render
all its numerous apartments, as commodious as
pottiblefor the great people, resident under
its wide extended canopy.
As the heart, the arteries and the veins cive
life and motion, by the circulation of the blood
through every part and limb of the human sys
tem, so the Bank, by means of the regular and
iyftematical arrangements under which it will
be governed, will circulate through the most re
mote as well as all the intermediate parts of the
Union, an active, vivifying, confidential and ea
sy commerce, extremely salutary to the health,
â vigour and comfort of the political body. One
of its firft and most indispensable laws, is the ut
most punctuality in dealing, another to circulate
its specie, or its representative, the Bank Bills,
which are equally as good, to as great an extent,
if possible, as its conltitution will allow, and a
third, as a consequence of the two former, to
dilcountenance or extirpate all unlawful or ufu
r:otis oppressive interest. Thus punctuality in
dealing, a plenty of ready cash, and a 1 eduction
of exorbitant antl unreasonable interest, are its
immediate confeqnences. It is true that it cre
ates a great, active monied interest : But we
have a great landed interest to balance it, and it
is the monied inrereft that pays and will conti
nue to pay all the federal Revenue of our coun
ty- } his wife and prudent policy will render
the discharge of the national debt light and easy
to the peopie, and will promote industry, enter
prize and commerce, at the fame time that it will
i aife the value ot rents, and all landed estate,
which had funk greatly below its iuft and proper
level, And when agriculture and commerce are
thus benefitted, the manufacturing interest can
not but participate in the common good. How
pleasing to Mr. Hamilton mnft it be, that these
things are justly laid of a ineafure which he pa
tronized and recommended.
On Saturday morning last, was launched from
one of the {hip-yards in this town, the beautiful
(hip Kami i.tov, of 200 tons burthen, belonging
to Meflrs. Brown and Benfon. She is an excel
lent veflel, and we learn, designed for the Euro
pean trade.

Canterbury, July I, 1761.
Died lately in Canterbury, the ailuined right
of Hopkintonian priests to turn other priests out
of the pulpit.âThe fame aflumed right is said to
be It ruck with death in the town of Plainfield,
and in many other towns in the county of Wind

Philadelphia, July 50.
A correspondent informs, that the treaty, late
ly held under commifiion from the President of
the United States, by Timothy Pickering, Esq.
of Wilkefbarre, with those Indian tribes com
monly called the Six Nations, at Newtown-Point,
on the north-weft branch of the Sufquehanna, in
the (laie of New-York, was concluded on the
rSth in ft. to the fatisfa<slion of all parties, by a
recapitulatory speech from the Commissioner.
The principal obje>ft of this treaty was, to con
firm the peace that has subsisted between us, ever
lince Ihe treaty of Fort Stanwix, in 1784, and
prevent the Five Nations from joining the Weft
em Indians, now at war. This desirable purpose
has been fully answered for the present, though
it is ivnpoffible to answer for the neutrality of
he Five Nations, in cafe they fliould still meet
with repeated injuries from those unprincipled
inhabitants of the frontiers, who have never yet
learned to diftinguifti friends from foes, under
rhe undiftinguiftiing appellation of Indians, or
Savages. The Five Nations, and f'ome other
tribes, came down armed to the number of ten
or eleven hundred, men, women, and children,
as their manner is ; but so slowly that the trea
ty, appointed for the x sth ult. was not opened
until the 2d inft. On the 27th, P. M. the cuf
toniary prefen*, confiding of a large quantity of
substantial cloathing, some of husbandry, and a
little powder and (hot, was diltributed to the
different tribes ; and the next day the commissi
oner, and the main body of Indians left the
ground. A few days before, letters had been
received from the Seneca warriors at Buffaloe
Creek, complaining of hostilities committed by
the Western Indians, and pressing the Chiefs in
Council to join the army of the United States in
reducing them to terms ; but little credit was
given to the accounts, and no answer returned
as they had determined to preserve a ftriift neu
trality. Amer: Dai. Adv.

dated June I J, i 791
" I have lately made a tour toPoft St. Vincennes,

one man in the rear of Fort Washington, and ta

Harmar's. lam in great hopes they will soon be

By the Hoop Friendship, Capt. Beecks, we have
accounts from Cape-Francois, so late as the 7th

COMMUNICATIONS.
It has been asserted, that Governmen* depends
on opinion ; if there is any truth in the plirafe,
it makes Government the most capricious idea in
nature. For what is more unftendy than the
107
ebb and flow of-the general sentiment on almost
every lubject submitted to public investigation ?
Such random, indefinite compliments may answer
temporary perfoiial purpoles, but their tendency
is to compliment the people out of their liberties,
peace and happiness.
The success which has attended the admini
stration of the genpral government, exceeds the
molt sanguine expectatitions of the warmest
friends to the Union of these free States.
Every anticipation has been more than realized ;
arid hitherto not one gloomy prediction has been
verified.âSo great is the peace and tranquility
that universally prevail, that some eagle-eyed
politicians, who are never happy while their
neighbours are lb wife as to think themselves so,
affect to be astonishedâand because the people
find 110 fault with their rulers, conclude that
either a stupid apathy hath seized the public
mind, or that a free investigation of publicmea-*
fures is fupprefled !
While every thing was afloat m these States ;
and civil discord was hovering over our tieads
while public and private confidence was deftroy
edâourCommerce was expiring, and our Credit
" a hilling and a bye-word among the nations,"
âour situation was, according to forge restless
scribblers, truly eligibleâbut when, awaking as
from a dream, v/e affertedour claim to freedom,
and to an honorable rank among the nations of
the earthâby ellablifhing the molt perfect Re
publican system of Government the world hath
ever seenâand under its blefled influences re
trieved our Credit, restored our Commerce, and
effectually succored and eftabliflied our agricul
ture, and mechanic Arts, strange to tell, we were
guilty of a dereliction of republican principles!
âHappy the People, whose rulers thus conduct;
and happy the Administration, who can only be
impeached for saving their Country !

The bridges are to be conftrutted on the principlesof those ercfl
ed over Charles, Myftick, and Beverly Rivers in the State of Mas
sachusetts, with a draw to admit a free pafTage for vetTels with fix
ed standing mails, not left than twenty-four feet wide, to be pla
ced in such part of the bridges as shall be determined moll con
venient for the navigation of the river, with piles or blocks on
each fide of the entrance of such draw, as shall be judged fufficient
to aid veffelsin palling through. Also, one lamp on each fide of
the draw, to be lighted every night from sunset to sunrise, during
the continuance of the Icafe.
The bridges aie to be built with such piles, timber, scantling,
and plank, as shall render them perfc6Uy fubflantial and fccure in
the opinion of the commiflioners, a-nd are to be of a fulficient
height to protett them against the tides, which rife at ordinary
tides from 5 to 6 feet, and at lpring tides from 8 to 10 feet. They
are to be 31 feet in breadth, viz.
Allowance for carnage way, 2c feet.
Do. for foot walks, railed off on each fide, 4 feet each, 8 feet,
Do. for balluftrades, 1 foÂ«t each, 2 feet.
Do. for hand-rails for do. 6 inches each, 1 foot.âTotal, 31 feet.
The fides of the bridges to be secured with strong balluftrades,
after the manner of the bridge between Bo ft on and Charleftown.
The bridges and draws are to be kept >n constant repair, and at
the expiration of the lease are to be surrendered in good or.der,
agreeably to the adt.
The following are the terms which the commiflioncrs are au
thor 1 fed to offer to contradlois :
A lease of the exclusive privilege of the bridges fer a period not
exceeding 99 years, with a toll equal to three-fourths of the pro
sent rates of ferriage.
From as accurate an estimate as could poflibly be obtained, the
a&ual receipts of the ferries for a medium of five years kill past,
amount to twelve hundred pounds, New-Jerfev currency, per
annum, three-fourths of that sum will consequently produce an
immediate income of gco pounds per aim. This may fairly be
estimated as the smallest profit that can be calculated upon. The
advancing population of the United States, the increasing inter
course between the two cities of New-York and Philadelphia, the
facility which the conftru6lion of these bridges will give 10 travel
ing, the caly communication thereby oflered with the (late 01
A r ew-York, on the western fide of the Hudson, are all important
cii cumftanc.es, which mull necessarily tend rapidly to accumulate
the profits of the bridges. The commiflioners are moreover au
thorized by law to raise four thousand pounds to be applied to
wards making causeways and laying out proper roads corineÂ£led
with the bridges, and have a lottery now on foot for that purpose.
As soon as the plaees shall be determined on where the bridges
are to be fixed, and the contraÂ£ls for eteÂ£ling them are executed,
the roads and causeways will be immediately undertaken.
Such persons therefore as may be inclined to contrast on the
above principles, will be pleased to fend in their terms sealed,
within three months from to Willi Maxwf.ll,
, ln , ISew : York Â» Specifying the shortest period of lease for
which they will undertake to crest the said bridges, together with
proper fccurity for performing the fame.
