pel tv of their parents, whether foreigners or Frenchmen. They
can contrast, acquire, and receive property fituatcd in France, and
dispose of it as well as any French citizen, in every mode autho
rised by the laws. . .
Foreigners in France are fubjeft to the fame criminal Jaws and
regulation* of police as French citizens: Their perrons, effects, in.
duftry, and religion, are equallv protefled by the law.
French colonic* and poftcflions in Alia, Africa and America, are
not included in the present Constitution.
N one of the powers instituted by the Constitution have a right

ROME, July 30.
AT lad Rome speaks :âThe Holy Father has'
palled the Rubicon : The Vatican has dart
ed its thunderbolts : The grand Bull the sum
mary of all imprecations, ajl excommunications,
all execrations, all decollations and maledictions
of the Church is ready : Perhaps, alas, ic has
already been sent ofF. All Frenchmen who have
participated in the creation of New-Bishops, even
the Prelates, all public functionaries, that have
taken the oath, their adherents and abettors,
without diftintflion of age or fexaie anathema
tized, are rejected from the bosom of the tender
mother of the faithful. It isimpollible to endure
any longer the outrages and the contempt of this
National Aflembly, who believe that a Pope is
only a spiritual head, that the Clergy must pro
fefs the fame felfdenial as Jesus Clirill, and be
governed, like others, by the precepts of the
Gospel. They will all be marked with the sign
of the bead, those miscreants, tliofe philosophers,
those regenerators of their country and religion.
It would be a pleasing fight to fee them ltigma
tized by the Pontifical Omnipotence. This would
be the only means to check those daring innova
tors, who are i>i(ulcnt enough to prefer the lim
plicity of Christianity to the pomp of Rome, and
the pure moral of a handful of common men, to
the elegant life of a number of gentlemen Eccle
fiaflics. To defer this would be lofingtan op
portunity to improve certain circumstances that
alone may re-establish the affairs of the Holy See,
which daily grow worse, even in Corsica, where
Gen. Paoli, on his return to Baftia, has succeed
ed to re eltablifli things upon a Conllitutional
footing, to obviate our holy intrigues, and to
install theeletfted Bishop in his functions, with
out the interference of His Holinifs.
FROM THE BRJSIOL GAZETTE, AUGUST 11
TUESDAY afternoon died at Downefend, In
the 54th year of his age the Rev. Caleb
Evans, D. D. many years President of the 13ap
tilt Academy, and Pallor of the congregation of
Protellant DiHenters in Broad mead, in thiscity.
1 hough he languished under severe indisposi
tion for upwards of two months, his death may
be pronounced sudden and unexpected. His
friends began to flatter themselves with the hope
of bis recovery, when, on Sunday lail in the af
ternoon, a second paralytic seizure, suddenly
rendered him speechless and insensible, in which
slate he continued till he expired.
How pleasingly those qualities, which recom
mend and endear the huftjand, the parent, the
friend, the chriltian, the tutor, and the niinifter,
were combined in him, those alone can tell, who
had the happiness of being connected with him
in those capacities. He podefled an enlarged
and libera]âa benevolent and pious mind ; and
while those individuals and communities with
whom he was more particularly connected vene
rate his memory, and mourn for his death, the
sympathy of society, wherever lie was known
will be excited, and his removal will be consider
ed as a public loss.
A GENUINE ANECDOTE,
IN the time of Sir Robert Walpole, when the
Bench of Bishops were not so independent as at
prefenr, Sir Robert Hood much in need of their
votes 011 a great National question, which he had
reason to think they would oppose. Sir Robert,
in order to secure their support, prevailed on the
Archbilhop of Canterbury, whom he had raised
to that dignity, to remain at home on the occasion,
and permit him to have it given out, that his
Grace was ill, and lay at the point of death. The
expedient took, the whole Bench, to a man, came
down to the House, and voted for the Miniftr .

ETTR. A ORDINARY SUICIDE.
An extraordinary and melancholy circumstance
took place yesterday afternoon 1 in Vinestreet,
Chandos-ftreet. A young man, genteelly drefl'-
ed, went with oneof the many wretched females
that inhabit that place, and, being alone with
her in the room, exprefled a great partiality for
the sensation of hanging ; he used many argu
ments to persuade the girl to tie him up for five
niiniites, which, in conf'equence of a protnifed re
ward of half a guinea, she at length consented
to ; upon this he produced a new cord from his
pocker, and she fattened him to a "staple in the
room. After he had hung some little time the
girl began to be terrified ; upon perceiving him
motionless file was so frightened ihe could not
fulfil her promise of cutting him down, and with
difficulty alarmed the people in the house, but
too late; for when afliftance came, he was too
far gone for recovery. Such is the account given
by the woman, nor did there appear any suspici
ous circumltances to doubt the fa<ft. He was tak
en to St. Martin's watch-house, and in his pockets
were found a guinea and an half, but no paper
which could lead to a difeovery of his person.
Peter Motteux, the well-known translator of
Don Quixote into Englifli, loft his life in thefame
manner, and from the fame caule, as the man
who was hanged in Vine-ftreer. Mr. Motteux
had taken two women of the town into a tavern
in St. James's (Ireet, who, by his desire, hanged
him, and were to have cut him down in five mi
nutes. Jult at this period, a trumpet was heard
in the ftreer, and some procession went along ;
the curiofily of the gjirls was excited, and when
they returned to relieve the suspended gallant,
he was dead.
The man who was hanged on Friday, by his
own desire, was a musician of some estimation ;
his name was Kotzwarra, a German. On the ex
amination of the girl, circumstances transpired,
which are improper for detail hereâthe mod fa
vourable conclusion we can draw is, that the man
was insane.
The Jury, after fitting till near 12 o'clock, re
turned with a verdiiftâGuilty of Murder-but
not intentionally.

OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
TO
BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the
House q*f Representatives,
I MEET you, upon the present occasion, with the feelings which
arc naturally inspired by a strong imprefiion ps the prosperous
Jituation of our common country, and by a persuasion equally
itrong that the labors of the session, which has just commenced,
will, under the guidance of a spirit no less prudent than pat * iotic,
i/Tue in measures, conducive to the liability and increase of national
prosperity.
Numerous as are the providential bleflings which demand our
grateful acknowledgmentsâthe abundance with which another
year has again rewarded thV industry of the husbandman is too im
portant to escape recollc6lion.
Your own observations, in your refpe&ive situations, will have
fatisfied you of the progreflive state of agriculture, manufa&ures,
commerce and navigation: In tracing their causes, you will have
remarked, with particular pleasure, the happy effects of that re
vival of confidence, public as well as private, to which the consti
tution and laws of the United States have so eminently contribut
ed : And you will have observed, with no less iutereft, new and
decisive proofs of the encreafing reputation and credit of the na
tion. But you nevertheless cannot fail to derive fatisfa&ion from
the confirmation of these circumstances, which will be disclosed,
in the federal official communications, that will be made to you in
the course of your deliberations.
The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which
completed the sum allowed to be fubferibed, in a Angle day, is
among the Unking and pleasing evidences which present them
selves, not only of confidence in the government, but of resource
in the community.
In the interval of your recess, due attention has been paid to the
execution of the different obje&s which were specially provided
for by the laws and resolutions of the last fefiion.
Among the most important ot these, is the defence and security
of the Weftem Frontiers. To accomplilh it on the most humane
principles, was a primary with.
Accordingly, at the fame time, that treaties have been provi
sionally concluded, and other proper means used to attach the wa
vering and to confirm in their fricndihip, the well.disposed tribes
of Indiansâeffe&ual meaCures have been adopted to make those
of a hostile deCcription sensible, that a pacification was deli red
upon terms of moderation and justice.
These mea Cures having proved unfuccefstul, it became neceflary
to convince the refra&ory of the power of the United States to
puniih their depredations. Offenfive operations have therefore
been dire&ed ; to be conduced, however, as consistently as pofli
ble with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have been
crowned with full success, and others are yet depending. The ex
peditions which have been completed, were carried on under the
authority, and at the expence of the United States, by the Militia
of Kentucky ; whose entcrprife, intrepidity and good conduit,are
entitled to peculiar commendation.
Overtures of peace are Hill continued to the deluded tribes, and
confideiable numbers of individuals belonging to them have latel)
renounced all further opposition, removed from theii former (itu
aiiom, and placed themfclves under the immediate prote&ion of
the United States,
It is sincerely to be desired, that all need of coercion, in future,
may cease; and that an intimate intercom fe may succeed ; calcu
lated to advance the happiness of the Indians, and to attach them
firmly to the United States.
In order io this, it seems neccflary,
1 hat ihey should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensa
tion of justice.
That the mode of alienating their lands, the main source of dis
content and war, should be so defined and regulated, as to ob
viate imposition, and, as far as may be praÂ£ticable, controversy
concerning the reality, and extent of the alienations which are
made.
That commerce with them (hould be promoted under regulations
tending to secure an equitable deportment towards them, and
that such rational experiments should be made, for imparting
to them the bleflings of civilization, as may, from time to time,
suit their condition.
That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to em
ploy the means to which the Indians have been long accustom
ed for uniting their immediate interests with the preservation
of peace.
And, that efficacious provision should be made for infli&mg ade
quate penalties upon all those who, by violating their rights,
ihall infringe the treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.
A lyftem correiponding with the mild principles of religion
and philanthropy towaids an unenlightened race of men, whose
happiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States,
would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to
the dictates of found policy. a
The powers specially veiled in me by the aÂ£l laying certain du
ties on diftilied Ipirits, which refpeft the subdivisions of the dif
tri&s into surveys, the appointment of officers, and the aflignment
of compensations, have likewise been carried into effefi:.âln a
matter in which both mateiials and experience were wanting to
guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived that there must
have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compeu
lation as would conciliate a rcafonable competency with a proper
regard to the limits prefcribcd by the law. It is hoped that the
circuinfpeftion which has been used will be found in the result to
have secured the l?ft of the two objects; but it is probable, that
with a view to the fir ft, in fomc inltances, a revision of the provi
sion will be found advifeable.
The impreflions with which ihis law has been received by the
community have been, upon the whole, such as were to be exped
c ' among; enlightened and well disposed citizens, from the pro
priety and neceflity of the mcafure.âThe novelty however of the
tax m a considerable part of the United States, and a misconcepti
on of some of its provisions, have given occ > r6pn in particular plac
es to some degree of difcontcnt.âBut it is fatisfaclory to know
tnat this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just
2ppreht*nfions of the true nature of the law. And I entertain a
u ' co,l fidence, that it will, in ill, give way to motives which a
r> eont of a just fenfc of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public
welfare.
If there are any circumftanccs in the law, which, confidently
*uh its main design, may be so varipd as to remove any well in-
objcftions, that may happen to exist, it will consist with
â¢u 1 e moderation ro make the proper variations. It is desirable,
'II oceafions, to unite wth a ftcady and firm adherence to con
â tiit jonnl and neccffaiy efts of government, the tulleft evidence of
a ' po.nion, as far as may be practicable, to confulr the wishes of
3rt Â°' l^C communt y> to lav the* foundations of the
P u icadminiftration in the affe&ions of the people.

Gentlemen of t.hi Senate.
wo Treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the
lerokees and fix nations of Indians, wiil be laid before you for
your conuderation, and ratification.
Gentlemen of thf. House of Representatives.
in entering upon the dtfchatge of your legislative trust, youmuft
anticipate with pleasure, that many of the difficulties, necessarily
incident 10 the firll arrangements of a new government, lor an
exten.ive country, have been happily surmounted by the zealous
and judicious exertions of your predecefTors in co-operation with
Â»ie ocuer ranch of the legislature. The important objc&s,
v.h'ch remain to be accompli.'hed, will, I am perluaded, *be con
ducted upon principles equally co.nprehenlWe, and equally well
calculated tor the advancement of the general weal.
Fne time-limited for receiving fuÃferiptions to the loans pro
piled by the adt making pvovifion for the debt of the United
Sates having expired,flatements from the proper department will,
as loon as possible, a:>prifc you of the exaÂ£l result. Enough how
ei er is already known, to afford an allurance that the views of
that afi have been fubftant'tally fulfilled. The fubfenption in the
d' Â»nv iiic debt of the United Stares has embraced by far the great
elt proportion of that debt ; affording at the fame time^proof
0 the general fatisfaClion of the public creditors with the
ft stem which has been proposed to their acceptance, and of the
ipirit o( accommodation to the convenience of the government
with which they are actuated. The fubferiptions in the debts of
tit .* relpcfliye States, as far as the provilious of the law have per
muted, may be said to be universal. The part of the debt
01 the United Staie>, whicii remains unfubferibed, will naturally
engage your further deliberations.
It is particularly pleating to me to be able to announce to you,
that the i even lies which have been ellabliOicd promifeto be ade
quate to their obje&s ; and may be permitted, if no unforefeen ex-
igency occurs, to fupei fede for the prcfent the neceflity of any new
b irthens upon our constituents.
An objrft which will claim your early attention is a provision
for the current service Â»f the ensuing year, together with such af
ccrtained demands upon the Trcafuiyas require to beimmediatc
lv discharged, and such casualties as may have arisen in the execu
tion of the public business, for which no fpecific appropriation
may have yet been made ; ol ail which a proper estimate will be
laid before you.
Gentlemen of the Senate and
House of Representatives,
I shall content mvfelf with a general reference to former com
munications for several objeÂ£ls, upon which the urgency of other
affairs has hitherto poftponcd any definitive resolution. Their im
portance will recal them to your attention ; and 1 trust that the
p-ogrefs already made in the most arduous arrangements of the
government, will afford you leifureto resume them with advan-
There are, however, fame of them of wtrich I cannot forbear a
more particular mention.âThele aie the Militia, the Poft-Olfice,
and Port Roadsâtl)e Mint, Weights and Measuresâa provision
for the sale ot the vacant Lands o* the United States.
The firft is certainly an object of primary importance, whether
viewed in reference to the national lecurity, to the faiisfaftion of
the community, or to the preservation of order.âln connexion
v. ith this, theeftablifhmcnt of competent magazines and arsenals,
and the fortification of luch places as are peculiarly important and
vulnerable, naturally ptefent themselves to confederation. The
fafely of the United States under divine protection ought to reft on
the basis of systematic and solid arrangements ; exposed as little
as to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances.
The importance of the Poft-Office and Poll Roads on a plan
fufficiently liberal and comprehensive, as they refpe& the expedi
tion, l'afety, and facility of communication, is increased by the
instrumentality in diffufing a knowledge of the laws and pro
ceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the
fecuritv of the people, serves also to guard them against the effctts
of misrepresentation and misconception. The establishment of
additional cro'.s Posts, efpeciaMy to some of the important points
in the Weitern and Northern parts of the Union cannot fail to be
of material utility.
The disorders in the existing currency, and especially the fcar
cityoffmall change, a scarcity so peculiarly diftrefling to the
poorer classes, strongly recommend the carrying into immediate
etfett the rcfolution already entered into concerning the establish
ment of a Mint. Measures have been taken pursuant to that reso
lution for procuring some of the raoft neceflaiy artists together
with the requisite apparatus.
An uniformity in the Weights and Measures of the country is
among the important objetts submitted to you by the conftitu-tion,
and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and
universal, must be no less honorable to the public councils, than
conducive to the public convenience.
A provision for the sale of the vacant Landsof the United States
is particularly urged, among other reasons, by the important con
siderations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the pub
lic debt; that if timely and judiciously applied, they may save
the neceflity of burtheoing our citizens with new taxes for the ex
tinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge
the principal but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought
to be loft for availing the public of its right.

l.onal rights of every citizen.
A confidence in the administration of this Government pervades
all classes and denominations of menâthis has animated every fa
culty of the human mind to exertionâand so fully convinced are
the people of the unlpeakable importance of peace and domestic
tranquility to the public profpeiity and happiness, that we mav
justly anticipate a long succession of years in which those princi

ihall be maturing to a state of perfe&ion, hitherto unknown. '

It is by force alone that an ignorant herd can

The duties of society are performed with chear

But the outrages of an ignorant multitude can
only be checlied by the interpolition of the mili

in England without an armed force.

66J do.LITERARY ANECDOTE,
â WH I CH OO CHT TO BE HAD IN IV Â£* LAS CIN6 REMEMBRANCE.
THE performance known by the title of Burn's
tresuife on the otlice of a Justice of Peace,
was written by a poor clergyman in the north of
England. He went to London to fell h;s manu
script, and enquired of the landlord at the inn
where he lodged, if he was acquainted with any
bookseller ? The matter of the house introduced
him to a person in trade, who after keeping the
manuscript for examination eight days, at laitof
fered him twenty pounds for it. After a variety
of disappointments of the fame kind, the author
waited on Mr. Miller, who was lifing fall: into
fame and fortune. He had fufliciemfcihennrth of
mind to fee that " honelty is the belt policy
and by treating every wiiter with justice, and
often with generosity, he acquired a molt opulent
fortune. He had in his employtnent gentlemen
in every different branch of learning, who were
to inform him of the merit of the different books
fiibmitted to their inflection. The manuscript
in question was transmitted to a Scotch lludent in
the temple, and Burn in the interim received a
general invitation to Mr. Miller's table. In eight
or ten days, the manuscript was returned to Mr.
Miller, with a note that it would be an excellent
bargain at two hundred pounds. Next day after
dinner, when the.glfcfs had begun to circulate,
he asked Burn, what was the lowed sum that he
would take ? The poor man replied, that the
highest offer which lie had received was twenty
pounds, a sum too finatl to defray the expences
of his journey.â" Will you accept two hundred
guineas ?" said Mr.Miiler. " Two hundiedgui
neas !" cried the paifon, clapping his hands, "1
am extremely fortunate."âThe book went thro
many impreflions, and Miller, of his own good
will, paid the clergyman an hundred pounds ad
ditional for each ,if them. As the author loved
port, the bookseller farther gave him a letter of
credit for the purchase of a pipe per annum dur
ing the reft of his life, in any wine-cellar in Lon
don, where he thought proper. " After all this,"
added Mr. Miller, in telling the story, " I have
lived to clear eleven thousand pounds by the
bargain."

have had their day upon the great theatre of time, and arc now no
more, fugged the moll important mementosâthese, with th - rapid

taught the enlightened citizens of the United States, that Jreedom

This conviction led to the adoption of the new constitution;
for however various the sentiments, refpeclingthe merits of this

A paper, therefore, elhblifhcd upon national, independent, and

a COMPETENT plan, it is presumed, will be highly inteicfting,

April 15, 1789,
THE plan and execution of the Gazette of the UniteÂ®
States, have received the approbation of a tribunal, from which
there is no appeal.
The subscriptions, which are encreafing, have long since exceed
ed the expe6lations of the publisherâa pun&ual compliance with
the terms would compensate his labours, and animate his future
exertions.
The Government that an enlightened and free people adopt, is
a sacred confederation âit knows no party âaud its profpcrity is
founded on the public good.
While ihe people are just to themselves, the administration of
their affairs will be committed to men of inregrity and competent
abilities ; 2nd it will be the duty of patriotism to impress the pub
lic mind with favorable i'entiments of the meaturcs of govem-
ment,
Our country continuing enlightened and free, the period can
not be anticipated when a publication 011 the plan of this Gazette
shall involve a dereliction of those principles with which the li
berties and happiness of the United States are connected.
With refpefi to the circulation of this paper, the Editor regrets
the recent difappoinmients which have unavoidably taken placeâ
he has always bten fully iinpreffed with the importance of punc
tuality, and cannot charge himfeif with a fingie un'lance of re
miffnefs.
It is very generally supposed that Congvefs, at the enfain?
feflicn, will take measures to ensure the circulation of news
papers m the United States; and particularly their tranfmiiTioii
from the Seat of Government to all parts of the Union. Justice,
policy and patriotism, plead irrcfiftcbly 111 favor of some eife&ual
provision's being made. The following pertinent and judicious
obfervatioHS on this fubjeft, lately appeared in an addrelstothe
public from the Editor of the Gazette of Maine. 1 hey
are substituted in preference to any thing which the editor of this
paper mtght further suggest, more particularly as coming from a
remote quarter of the Union.
" Perhaps there is no country, in any part of the world, the in*
habitants of which arc, (or may be) supplied with public News
papers at a chcapcr rate than those of Amciica. The Farmer and
ihe Merchant, the Laborer and the Mechanic, may, by the means
of a public Paper, when he retires from the bufinels and fatigue*
of the day, take a view of the situation, the circumstances and the
various revolutions of the several countries of the civilized world
And it must be a pleasing circumftancc, that this is the privilege*
emphatically the privilege of an American. > .
" Let it therefore be remembered, that by virtue of this privi
lege, the body of the people conllantly obtain and prefeive such a
degree of knowledge as fliall be competent to the prevention or
any attempt that may be made by cunning and deftgnmg men to
f?.p the foundation of our most iuvaluable constitution. But, l't
the'circulation of these Vehicles of Public Information becircum
fcribed. and the people will at once bccome uninformed o. 1 pub IC
tranfa&ions, and the more enlightened jew will engross the pn vl *
leges, immunities and prerogatives, which in the nature and fiine s
of things, are the indefeafible right of the whole body oi I ,c
people.
" It is piefumed no American will need a stimulus of tins na
ture to furnifh himfelt with public information. The cheap nte
at which it is offered, the love and glory of our country, wi aC
all times promote such a mode of condudt, as lhall forever bar t
attempts of tyranny, ignorance and lupeifbtion."
