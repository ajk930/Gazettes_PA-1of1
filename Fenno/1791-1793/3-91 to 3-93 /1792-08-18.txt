FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.
REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNION.
Concerning the laws, which intrench vfen the rigijs
oj property.
IT is not remembered that the atts of the na-
have been deemed by any
ot tlie poflelTors of any defer iption of pro'nertv,
Unfavorable to their right?, cxccpt the pro
ceedings in regard to the public debt. It hno
less curious than true, that a part of t'.e com-!
munity affirm that the government have iniu
red the country by too much liberalitv, while
another part charge the legiflati-.re with im
pairing the contract.
In taking a view of this Ajbjeft, it should be I
remembered, that the state of things when it
was taken up, was in every refpeft critical and
uncertain. It was difficult to fay what the
country could perform, and more so to tell what
they would comply with. It was perceived
on the one hand, that as such a ftatc of public
credit as preceded the year 1789, would ruin a
government more energetic than that of the
United States, so its immediate melioration
was a matter of the mcft imperious neccflity.
On the other hand, the non-exiflence of one
imgiccjftcient funding fyftem,yielding a full/be
cie inhrej} y in any one State, and a number of
painful facts in the financial operations of some
o tne legislatures, created a conviction, that
there was either an inability or disinclination
in all to render a specie payment in the full ex
tent of the explicit contra<sh. Some of the eon
tracts were found not to be explicit, containing
piomi.es of large sums under the name of spe
cie, which it could not have been the expecta
tion of the government at their date to dis
charge, or of the creditor to receive, in coin ;
because they promi/ed to pay as specie, what
was notoriouily much less valuable than con
ti adli previouflv liquidated at forty nomina
cÂ»ollars for one in coin. The peculiar claims
of the original creditors also were flrongly re
pre fen ted, while the conduct of every State ir
t ie union, in its particular finances, bad dif
countenanced a difcriminat'on in their favor ;
and the eflablifhed Jaws of property were urgec

species of t:;e public paper, taken at a medu;ni
would have been worth the nomina! value in th
111 ark et. Hitherto it never has b*en.
There yet remain, however, i n the United
States forae law; which affect the rights of pro
perty. The operation of inftalinent and valua
tion laws is not terminated in two or three of
tie State - .. In two or three others, paper mo
ney is a tender in all or in particular cases. In
some quarters, real estate is protected from ex
ecution for debt; and in others, the judgments
ot the courts are suspended, if the income of
theejlate bears a certain proportion to the ere
tlitoi ,s demands. In some of the Stages pre
ferences are given to the claims of citizens, be
fore those ol citizens of the other States, or of
foreignersand a variety of ill exists in many
quarters, in the form of infolventi laws. The
federal constitution, and those oi several of
the State', have barred the introduction of tbele
evils in regard to new tranfaftions; and the
States which are not chargeable with them, in
regard to past affairs, have reaped, in the last
three years, an ample reward for their wis
dom and virtue. Property may almost be called
the palladium of communities Tiieir moral fafety
at least is always at hazard, when that is un
warrantably invaded. In every cafe wherein
culties to obtain his own are interpoied in
the way of the honest and industrious citizen,
nis loft is not all the public injury. A fellow
citizenâperhaps a member of a legislature (and
through him a legislature itfelf) is corrupted in
nis principles.

since the Ueg'nning of the prcfent year. It hjs

despotism. anil an atiftocracy, is not only formed
but almost effectedâand that the conipiraiors arc
corrupt speculators, and breakers ol public trust.

praise to which the writers lay claim.
It is not easy to conceive of any men out of
Bedlam having lormcd schemes so inconfiflent
with each other as they have pretended to divulge.

a motion to recommend to the citi

principles than that by which we are
now governed.

Principally ditflated by the opinion,
that equality and liberal/i'ity of re
pi'ffematioir, are the fundamental
pillars <,f iiijertyât;,at i lie right to
be re pre (cured, is t lie natural and un
alienable privilege of every citizen
who duly contributes to the fupporc
of governmentâand that the conllj
1111ion of this Hate, if we have one at
all, is very repugnant to both.
Two objections will be advanced
firft, the expence of the coi.Â»Â«nt!onâ
secondly, the danger of relaxing the
sinews of government : To which I
obfervp, that the expeitee will bear
no comparison to the inestimable ad
vantages of a free and equally repre
sented government ; and that no mail
of common underflanding, or know
ledge of the tempers and wishes of
our citizens, can be seriously appne
henfive, that they from whom the
government springs, by whom it is
supported, and to whom it belongs,
will, in the necefliry exercise of the
natural and imptefcriptable privileg
es, fedii ioufly attempt to do any thing,
the evil of which will ultimately de
volve on themselves.
No government can long be free
except one by reprefenratioii, and e
very Itep which a government falls

inequality of leprefeiitation, can be

it will be said, that the necefilty of

cause Congrcfs liave muter their con
' troul, rs 11 the great objects of legisla
tion. To this it may be anfweved,
that Congress have eltabiiflied an ex
cife,odious even in monarchical coun
triesâ they have imposed duties too
enormous for a free people to bear
they have ertablifhed an army, when
there is not the profpe<st of an enemv
againfl whom the army is to operate
âthey have reftricied the free circu
lation of newspapers, by a measure
unprecedented, and extremely obnox
iousâand if we are to conclude, in
future, from the pad, 1 fear that we
shall be led on to experience theJa
vorit: and dia6olical maxim, that the
exigencies of government fliouid be
always equal to her resources. If so,
and this principle shall be the basis
of federal lepflation, we may expec'i
that armies and navits will incieafe
upon ns, as fall as we have the ability
to pay their expencesârior will it be
material whether we pay iol. per an

Itead of 4/"6 per gallonânails at 12s
instead of ios per JVI. or pay the mo
ney directly to the colletSor or cx

Armies,wharevertlie pretext for raid
ing them, have either been thediretft
oppressors, or tools of oppreflive jyoW;.
er, in every age and clime : And al
though I do not fear that the present
American army, for many of tfhotnl
have a high personal refpedl, can be
thus used, because of their own fetr
tiinents, I fear for future times : I
dislike the principleâl dislike the ex
pence 1 know that a regular army
is not calculated for an Indian war
that we have not another ofFenfive e
nemy if we feck oneâand that one
fourth, or less than a fourth, of the

Such sentiments, under such cir
cumltances, induce me tb'thiiik thar

THE revolution in Poland, f'o tem

citizens as of an inferior Ipecies ; and
lience the emancipation ot that nati

annihilation of that order in the ttate,
which had been the hereditary op
pretfors of mankind for generations.
In Poland the nobility, by the de

who is generally imagined to have
been the foul of the plot, has taken
his measures with so much caution,
that the Connfel for the prosecution
has not hitherto been able to adduce
legal evidence against him fufficient

years old, during the greatest part of
which time he has been concerned in
every scheme of revolution, of which
the Swedith lliftory produces so many

The French have stationed between
Beachy Head and Dunkirk two fri
gates and an armed brigantine, in

Eaft-Indiaman now on the point of
failing from Oftend. These veflels
captured, on Wednesday morning, a
dogger, bearing Dutch colours, and
said to be equipped by the Dutch East
India company at Middleburgh. The
officers and crew were, however,
chiefly Flemish; the lading was found
to have come from Oftend ; and the
Captain of the little French squadron
fufpedting imposition, sent one of his
frigates with thevefTel into Dunkirk,
where they are now arrived. The

" M. Duminique, minister of Itate
to the Elector of Treves, on the 3d

the French Princes, expressing the
surprise of the Elector, that the emi
grants fliouldftill cominuctoallemble
at Treves, and thereby render him
liable to be suspected by the court of
France, to whom he wished to avoid;
giving umbrage. That he had in
consequence given orders for all the
French emigrants to quit Treves, the
towus of Wittleick and Phlazel, and
all the villages adjoining thereto, by
the Bth of May ; and 1 the
French Princes to second his inten

emigrants may, however, if they can

B O S T ON, Augoft 9
j Capt. Hopkins, who arrived here
on Sunday the Jth infl. from Russia,
j informsâThat at the date of his fail?
! ing therefrom, he could not learn that
â any warlike preparations were mak
ling in the Ruffian empit e : That there
jhad been many reports of attempts to
poison the Empressâone of which, it
was said, had been diliovered to be
made by several Kren/inien ; âThat
in consequence, an order ot Hate had
been iflued, for apprehending the
confpirarors (ten of whom had been
taken) â and for pnnifhing with death
every Frenchman who remained
within the empire nfter a certain
timeâand, that Capt. Hopkins bro't
away therefrom three French gen
tlemen.
One fail will outweigh in the pub
lic opinion a thousand declamations,
jit is aliened, but with a colouring
that renders the afTeitibn at leaftful
picious, that " all who have become
rich in the United States, for several
late years, are Speculators ; and that
to raise these harpies to wealth and
eminence, the indultrious Merchant
has been opprefled with the molt
grievous burdensâburdens which
mult operate his ruin." This is af
ferriofi without proof. For a /hort
lime, it mult be allowed, owing to the
madness, or something worse, of a
few desperate individuals, Speculation
ali'nmed a glare, that aftomlhed, and
in many inltances, captivated, the be
holder.
Ac length, however, like the linka
ble glitter of a meteor, it diflipated,
and so far were its votaries from hav
ing acquired " immenle fortunes"
therebyâthat it left themâin prison,
in poverty, or in exile.âOn the other
hand, in all the bankruptcies of the
lalt year, not one in the mercantile
line is to be traced ; and from the
great increase of the fliippingâthe
advancement of commercial and ma
nufatfiural business-institutionsâand
every mechanical businessâand from
the general happiness which pervades
every part of the Union, we may ven
ture to aflert, nor fear a contradic
tion, that .success has abundamly
crowned every effort of commercial
enterprise and indultryâand that our
Merchants universally are feeinggood
days according to the days wherein
they have seen evil. And well do the
Merchants deserve this prosperity,
and an increase of it. Their patri
otism has been immortalized by our
beloved Presidentâand they mull: en
joy thepleafing fatisfac'tion, that they
have been greatly inftrumenta! in ad
vancing their country to a height of
prosperity, reputation, and felicity,
unexampled in her annals.
That ihefe are FACTS is visible to
every man who wifties to fee them so.
And they (hall be told to the world,
as long as they continue to be such.

from a calculation on the sums annually paid for

From all which the naturai inference is, that

FOR THE GAZETTE Of THE UNITED STATES.
Mr. Fenno,
The Editor of the National Gazette receives
a salary from that government, which for
nine months past the writers in his paper have
been laboring to render odious to the people â
To abate the force of this charge, with
coofiftency your readers will determine for
themselves, the National Gazette of Wednes
day informs the public, that u IMr. John Fenno
enjoys exclusively the printing for theTreafury
Department."âFrom the best authority I am
informed, that this alTertion is entirely un
founded it is not a fatt, at the present mo
ment, nor has it been so since the firft inftitji
tion of the Department, that any individual has
iiad the printing business thereof, exclusively.
Four or five different printer?, hcaa ami
now are employed to perform the printing ne
ce.Tary to be done for the Treafury.âAnjpflg
these are Mr. Aitkin, MefTrs. Childs and Swaine,
Mr. Bailey, Mr. Fenno, &câThree or four of
them, if not the whole number, retain the exe
cution of thole parts of the treajury printing to
this day f which they were at firft employed to
do. One coufiderable branch of this treajury
printing is performed in the oTice of Mellrs.
jChilds and Swaine, where Mr. Frencau's Nati
onal Gazette is printed.ââln addition to this
the Printers of the National Gazette, are Prin
ter? to the House of Rep-efentatives of the
United States,are Printers for the Government,
of the laws of the Union, by Authority, in vo
lumes, âand for the state of New-York in the
Daily Advertiser âthey are alio Printers for the
Department of State. All tiiis work, tne
Daily Advertiser excepted, is executed in the
Office in which Mr. Frcmau's National Gazette
is printed.
The Printers before named, with several
others applied to the Government for employ
ment in the line ef their profeffionâthofe which
obtained a preference, have rendered Isrvica
to the public-âhave been paid as other media
nics employed by the public Jiave been paidâ
and asfuch are totally di conne&ed with the
government. ,
Surely then, the administration cannot be
charged withexclufively encouragingtho.e pre -
fes that have approbated its meafnres w,,en a
press that teems inceifantly with ekufe of tbofe
measures, enjoys by far the proportion
of the printing business executed

THE charges which have keen brought a
gainst " the Editor of the National
Gazette," as he himfelf ltates them to be, arc
no otherwise personal charges, than as they de
fignate the pcrfoni, against whom they are made.
In their application to Mr. Freneau, t'ley af
i'ei't him solely in his capacity of Editor of a
public paper (which may juftlv be considered as
a public capacity) and in relation toinatters of
public or national concern. It is therefore a
nicer fubterfuge to call tkem ptrfonal charges,
and then to fay, that they full not be anlwered,
tinlefs the author of them will come for-.vard to
fapport them. It was eaiily anticipated that
he might have good reasons for not discovering
himfelf, at Jeaft at the call of Mr.Freneauâand
it was necefl'rtry for him to find a (belter. \v r iiat
else could he do ! The charges brought against
him are substantiated by f-.is, some ot them ac
knowledged by himfelf, others proved l>v a re
ference to public documents, and to his own
paper ; others of general notoriety.
The inferences from theJe fa s are tiie only
things, which remain for difcutlion ; and tfcefe
so naturally flow from the premises, that t'.ey
defy the arts of fophiftrv to obfenre them. The
expedient however which has been adopted,
comes rather late ; confuiering that Mr. Kre
neau began to answer even under the folenin:-
ties of an oath.
For the GAZETTE of the UNITED STATES,
Mr. Fenno,
IT has been clearly proved (fays the National
Gazette) that the Poll-Office was not sacred
in the years 1787 and 1788. The lame junto,
or persons of the fame itamp, who are now so
busily employed to fubvcrt the government of
this country, made the above assertion while
the Conftrtution was under ditcuiiionâbut did
they ever prove it?âNoâLet the names of the
guilty be exposedâor, if not, let the fabricators
of such fa I ill hoods beheld in just abhorrenceâ
for these arc the persons who would have pre
vented, if poflible, the union of the states, and
tlie adoption of any system of general govern-
ment whatever.
Exttafl from <s circular address of a number of the ci
tizens of Philadelphia to t/\e citizens oj Pennfl-
vania,
Friends and fellow-citizens,
<e THHE great blessings enjoyed by the ii.habit-
JL ants of the United States, under the pre
sent constitution, mull excite a wilh in the bo
som of every good citizen, to promote such
measures as are 1110 ft likely to render thole blef
fmgs permanent. That this cannot be obtain
ed without a wife and virtuous representation
in Congress, and without a constant fuccefiion
of such public characters as have nothing in
view but tiie welfare of their country, must be
evident to every American. To effett this
wife and'vi: !:non-: fucceUion of representatives
and rulers, so far as the voice and fuTrages of
Pennsylvania are entitled to extend, has attract
ed the attention of many of the citizens of
Pennsylvania.âConsidering the importance of
t'le ensuing election, where thirteen members
are to be chosen in one it becomes a
question of interesting discussion, to determine
011 the best mode of uniting the sentiments of
the citizens, throughout the State, on this great
business. To leave every part of tne State to
farm an independent ticket, without consulting
their fellow-citizens, would be to riik an ap
pointment, by even a very finall minority. For
although the fuffrages in favor of one ticket
might be fnperior, in number, to any other, yet
that superiority might be composed of less than
a tenth," 01* twentieth part of the voters. Ne
ccflity tnen calls for a free communication of
sentiments previous to the election. How this
can bcft be efFected must be left to the different
parts of the State to determine."
EXTRACT.
" AS almost every material expended in car
rying on manufactures arises from the earth,
the consumption must benefit the agricultural
interest of the country, not only in fumilhing a
market for our raw materials, and saving mo
ney to the country, but by the number of hands
that will be employed in carrying on the dlifer
ent manufarttires they may engage in; ourhome
confumption will be encreafed, by its being ex
pended by the manufacturers, who do not raise
their own bread ; by which means we fliall not
entirely be left to precarious foreign markets,
which probably will become lefs,from that spirit
of liberty, which appears to be extending over
the greatefl part of Europe. For as pfoperty in
every country where liberty prevails, is secur
ed to the cultivator and polieiFor, they now
have every stimulus that can excite them to in
dustry, and increasing their agricultural produc
tions. France, a country blest in the goodness
â of Us foil, and a temperate climate, under the
administration of its formed tyrannical govern
ment, seldom was .able tofarnifhit; inhabitants
with bread; but hereafter, we must expect
grain will be railed, not only fumcient for their
own consumption, but to supply foreign mar
kets ; as the deficiency did not arise from any
sterility in the foil, or an unfavorable climate,
but from exorbitant taxes, together with over
bearing and greedy landlords, and a rapacious
clergy, who amongst them, swept away the,
whole produce of the poor Peasant's industry ;
for that was the highest title they then would
afford him. Poland, a great wheat country,
from the inoft abject state of aristocratic vaflal
age, by the virtus of a patriot King, is emanci
pated from its flavery,and from the fame cause,
(that of enjoying the fruits of their own labour)
the farmers will undoubtedly encreafe the quan
tity formerly railed for exportation "

On Monday, the 6th day of this instant, the
Supreme Court of tfte United States met, when
all the judges were prelent. The Attorney-
General of the United States gave notice, that
he should move the Court on tiie Wednesday
following for a mandamus to the Circuit-Court
of PennlVlvania, commanding them to proceed
on the petition of William Hogburne, a claim
ant of a pension, in which they had refufed to
proceed, from a supposed nullity cf the
law. The motion was accordingly begun on
Wednesday; when afrerfome prefatory remarks,
the Attorney-General was alked from the bench,
whether he conceived it to be an official right
to offer such a motion, as he had intimated it
to be. He answered, that be did conceive it to
be an official right. Upon which l'cveral obser
vations were made, and tiie debate continued
from day today until Saturday last. The opin
ions of the judges being then taken, they were
equally divided.

In confcquence of this division, it was im
proper for the Attorney-General to move the
fubjedt officially. He then appeared as counsel
for the invalids; and the motion, after being
accompanied with the reasons, which influenced
him to believe that the Inferior Court had er
red, was poftpened for a final decilion until the
next Court.

son was never known in Carolina than the pre

of the suspicions entertained of their intention

the following interesting tefolutions were en
tered into by that board, viz.
Whereas the board havewith great attention
examined the ground from the mouthof Storey
creek down,with a view to determine where the
weft end of the canal fnall unite with the river
Schuylkill, and finding that it will be practica
ble to cut a caual 0:1 the east lide of the rive last
mentioned, from the moll northerly point al
lowed liy the law, and that the fall from thence
to high*water mark at the Delaware, at the
noi ihfoLunds orther city of Philadelphia, amounts
to fifty feet; and that various and mul
tiplied will result from taking the
water from the Schuylkill at the mouth of Sto
neV creek :
I Therefore refojved, That the canal shall
commence as high up the river as the law per
mits.
It was farther resolved, That Do&or Rit
tenhoufe be requefred to lay out and stake off
the ground for the canal ; and that he be em
powered to employ such alHftants and workmen
as he may find necessary in the business.
The board also agreed to appoint a fuperin
tendant, in order to commence the work with
out day; and Proposals for such an appoint
ment were dire&ed to be pubiilhed, so that we
I may expect the butinefs to be carried on with

A free constitution and equal laws fteadiiy
admin iltered are deemed "ejlcrftial to liberty
If, without these, it were pollible that liberty
could be enjoyed to day, it would be with a
melancholy forefight 01 its certain lois to-mor
row. Will it do therefore in America, where
the people have been lo much br*
educatiou, and have feeu 4Mid-pR r acUictl lb long
in the school of their own politicsâwill it de
ceive any body lor men to call themielves
friends of liberty, who are oppoled to its nrlt
principles and inoit important defences? These
men diilike the constitutionâthey want amei^d-
ments âit is indefiniteâ"too much power is
givenâpart must be taken away and given to
the state government;âcanfolidation is of all
evils the greateil and the molt certain to befall
us- Yet toeyallure us, andwho can doubt what
these men of truth ulfert, that they are friends
of the conltitutionâfriends of Â£;ood order, anxi
ous for the prefer vat ion of the public tranquil-
lity. They have oppoicd almoit every impor
tant law that has palled âthey ft ill reprelent
the laws as horn in fin, and nurled in corrup
tion, and worse than any thing in the unive'rfe,
except thole who made and thole who execute
I them. Still they mean no harmâthey would
I not touch this system of' fraud and corruption.
If they could hold the reins of government,
which for the pure love of virtue and liberty
of the people they would condescend to do, they
would deem themselves bound to proceed againlt
liberty and justice, by carrying tiie wicked sys
tem, now a lacred law, into erfedh While tlie
people chufe to maintain the laws and constitu
tion, the counsels of theft men, too gross to de
ceive, and too pernicious to guide them, wi 1 be
dilregardedâbut the nature of their counsel
evinces, that whenever the work of destroying
j law and government shall be undertaken, wil
ling laborers will not be wanting.
Let us for one moment, the adtual
situation of our country as ,portrayed on a late
anniverlary, with the representations, or rather
misrepresentations of thofc wno have under
taken to censure public measures, and to brand
their authors with every opprobrious epithet.
The Independence of the United States
has been celebrated this year throughout the
Union, with uncommon attention. Among the
numerous toasts and fentiiv.ents which have
been given on the occasion, tie genuine princi
ples of republicanism, always friendly to good
government, form a diitiuguiflied part âthe
prosperity of our country has been almost uni
versally recolle&ed and acknowledged; and
Scarcely a lisp or reflection to the disadvantage
>f the measures of government, or the men in
office, has been utteredâon tlie other hand, the
Chief of Patriots, whose. iignature has fandtion
ed those measures from which Inch solid bleflings
have flowed, has received theuniversal plaudits
of freemen. Among all the numerous collec
tions of the citizens in the various states, which
of the laws of the United States has beeu disap
proved ?âWhere fljall we look frÂ»r evidences ot
public happinef;, if not in those aflemblies of the
people where every cifcurnil tfice conspires to.
unbend the mind, and give a loose to the genu
ine emotions of the foul ?
" Warm from the heart, and tme to all its fires/*
Springs the bright hope, the Patriot's breaifc in
spires.
Some djny the fdft that the country ha- pros
pered under the influence of* the new govern
ment. Others wifely fay, it would have done
as well without a new constitution. Another
set admit the fact, but draw an inference from
it of a different kind. They fay, the season ct
prosperity is dangerous "Wealth corrupts and
lays jealousy to sleepâand now the plot against
liberty is going on briikly, while we are unluf
picious of danger. We (hall wake up withfome
money in our pockets it is true, but slaves, fay
they. It is not strange that the lultre of go
i vernment should make its old enemies, the 19-
[ vers of darkness and confufion, sick.
u Thou that with furpafling glory crown'd,
u O Sun, I tell thee how I hate thy beams"â
was said by an old enemy of government.
There is a class of men with whom the insi
nuations against the purity of government, and
the pretences of corrupt speculations by men in
public trust, will have influence. They, how
ever, were never friendly to it. Knaves take
the suspicion of foul play for the proof of it.â
Each finds in his own heart that the tale of
slander might be true. We are as often duped
by too little confidence in men, as by too much.
It is too late in the day for the people to be
deceived by the wind music of certain declaim
ers on the deplorable situation of our countryâ
they have thrumbed this tune so long, that it is
aftonilhing they are not tired of hearing itâ
when they are at length almost reduced to the
situation of certain preachers in London, whole
audiences are frequently no more than the vi
car and clerk.
