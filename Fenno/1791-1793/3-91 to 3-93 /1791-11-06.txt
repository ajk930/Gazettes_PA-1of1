[No. 55, of Vol. lII.] Saturday, November 5, 1791.
ANSWER of M. SYEYES,
ft Mr, Paine's Letter, and to fevcrai other publt
cations of a simitar nature..
(CONC LUDED.j
" T UNDERSTAND by a republic," fays Mr. Paine," a go-
X vcmnnnt founded upon the principles of thi Declaration ot
Rights." Ido not fee why this government Ihould not be a Mo-
"Principles," fays he, " with which many pans of the French
Conltiiulion are in contradiction." This is poflihle ; and it is
probable, that if it was proposed to form a republic, offences
might be committed against the Declaration of Rights. But who
do. s not fee that thele contradictions may be remedied without
an abolition of the monarchy ? Mr. Paine will permit me to tell
him a fccond time, that since I do not require him to fupportany
particular republican form, it is vight that he should allow me the
lame liberty with refpeft to monarchy.
I dcfne, that our difcullion, it it takes place, may not depart
from the spheres of theory. The truths winch we lhali establish
may descend too slowly, or too fuft, to be applicable to lacts.
.But I have already said enough to make it undcrllood, that at
present, I feel much more powerfully the instant nccellity ot el
ublifning the decreed Constitution, than that of reforming it.
" The Declaration of Rights of France and America aie onl)
one and the fame thing in principles, and nearly so in words."
So much the worse. I could wish that ours might be the bell,
and it would not be difficult to make it so.
" And this is the republicanism which I havr undertaken to
defend against what is called monarchy and aristocracy." A man
â¢who liycs in France, or any other part ot Europe, will allow, that
it we are to take the word? jepublic and monarchy only in th< ir
common acceptation, we shall be disgusted by the mere mention
otthem. Have I not an opportunity, it I was to follow the ex
ample givt 11 rre by Mr. Paine, to cast lome discredit upon thai
â which is called republicanilm and aristocracy ? Would a ieuati of
execution be less ai iftocratical, when ministers a&ingunder the li ce
and lrrcfjjonfible choice ot a monarch, whose evident and palpa
ble intereit * ould be always li.fcparable irom that ot the ma
jority ?
I have, perhaps, done wrong in making so eailv a discovery of
oy doubts as lo the excellence of ihe republican system. How
iar are ihofe from understanding me, who reproach me with not
adopting a republic, and believe, thai not to proceed so far, is
to Hop upon the road ! Neither the ideas nor the sentiments which
arc called republican, are unknown to me ; but in my design oi
advancing alway? towards the maximum ot locial liberty, 1 ought
to pass the republic, to leave it Ur behind, and to arrive at true
monarchy. If lamin an error, I declare, that it is neither for
want of tune nor attention ; tor my refearchcs and results pre
ceded the revolution.
I acknowledge, that, for a note, this is become very long;
but 1 was defirousot providing, that if our d J leu ill on look place,
it fliould not degenerate into a dispute of words. It will iciult,
I believe, from the perusal of the above, that men who are wil
ling io speak in precise terms, will not permit them (elves to fup
poieihat republicanilm is the opposite of monarchifm. The cor
icllative ot one is many. Our adverlarics are PolyarchiftsâPoli
cies ; ihofe are their true titles. When they caii themselves re
publicans, it thou Id not be by oppohtion to monarchy : they
â are republicans because they aie lor the public intcrclt, and cer
tainly we are so too.
The public iuiereft, it is true, has been for a longtime facrificed
to private views; but has not this evil been common to all known
States, without regard to their leveral denominations? If, inifcead
ot adopting clcar notions, happily by etymology lifelf,
it >s deteinuued to perliti in a confufion of words which can be
ufeful to no poflible end, without doubt 1 (hall not obstinately
oppoie it. 1 will permit the word â¢â¢ Republic" to be fynoin
rnous to *Â« Reprt-fentaiive Constitution but I declare, that after
having taken it in this fenle, I ihall feel a neceility of enquiring,
alter all, whether they Ihould wish that our republic (hould be
monarchic, or Poliarchic. Let us then, if we can, eltablith the
quUtion in thele termsâ" In a good republic, is it better that
ine government fliould be monarchic, or Poliarchic (
1 tinilh this letter by a remark with which I ought to have be
>t. My letter inserted in the Moniteur of the 6th ot July, dot s
not announce, 41 that I have le sure to enter into the controversy
with the republican Policraics." My words are theseâ '* I shall
soon have time to attend to this question." Why soon ?
Because 1 am persuaded that the National Aflembly will, in a Ihoit
linae, put the la ft hand to their work, and that it is upou the very
point of being ftnilhed.
Until then, it i* impoflible for me to leave my daily occupations
to fill the Journah with any fort of difculfion. 1 may be told,
thai this qurition is the order of the day, but 1 do not perceive thai
it is. Belides, a friend of l'berty does not chufe to discuss qucf
tions ol right, under the empire of queltions ot taCL '1 tlis enqui
ry into pi inciples, and the publication them, has been already
so fufficirntly laborious, to a man lett to his individual pow rs,
thot he should not expose himfclf to the regret of having wilhcd
to speak reason, at a time when the mod decided determinations
deprive manv of the poflibilitv Â°1 attending to it, and leave only
the refplutiou ot (civing, in spite of him, the one or thr othi r
party. EM. SYEYES*

FROM A LONDON PAPER
AGRICULTURE.âLEICESTERSHIRE
TO (hew what a good name, and a good use of
it will doâMr. Bakewell lets three Ranis this
season lor i hree Thousand Guineas !
A Society of Farmers, called the " Tupp
Club," offered him an annuity of 25001. per an
num, for five of his Fiams, which he refufed :
and apparently not unwisely, as he makes three
thuufand on three of them.
The excellence he boalts in his breed, is to
have the lealt given quantity of bone, with the
greatelt quantity of (lefli. He (hews carcases of
them with ten inches of fa: upon lhe ribs ; and
whiie they feed to this (ize, they do it 011 a very
finall proportion of food, when put in competiti
on with others.
Their heads and limbs are very small. They
have no horns, but a large quantity of wool,
vvhich is rather of a coarse kind.
Mr. Bakewell has been lately trying an expe
riment somewhat lingular. He has been rotting
some llieep purposely, for the fake of trying a
medicine, sent to him by the Odiham Agricul
ture Society, for the cure of that difoider.
Thus lie has made sure of the disease, what
ever he may do of the remedy.
E} improvements adopted by the Monmouth
(hire Agricultural Society, since the drawing up
of the firft plan, it appears, that premiums are to
be given for the encouragement of industry a
niong the lower orders, viz. to servants who have
lived the grfateft number of years in one place ;
to laborers who have reared the greatest number
of children without parochial affiltance ; or any
other description that may hereafter be proposed
as eligible objerts.

Amongst the nianv philolophical and mechan
ical inventions which this speculative and expe
timental age daily produces, we are led to no
tice two new and curious ones, for which patents
have been obtained ns advenifed in the lalt Lon
don prints: The firli, Sympathetic Hinges and
Locks, for folding doors : it is peculiar to theft
hinges, that which ever door be opened, the
other receives precisely the fame motion, so that
both doors open and font e*a<ftly together ; and
ir is peculiar to these lofks, tha: the handle of

venience and elegance, is nirich exceeded 111 uti
lity, by the other, which is called a Thermonie
trical Kire Alarm, and poliefles the invaluable
property of giving immediate notice, to any re
quired diftan.ce, of the leall increase of hear
which mny happen in the premises in which it is
fixed. This early communication and alarm will
enable families to resort to the neceflary mea
sures to stop the progress of the flames ; or, in
the worit cafe, to provide for the fafety of their
persons and properties.
We every now and then liave accounts 111 the;
papers of the flotirifliing and prosperous state of
America, fincc lhe was ieparated from Great-Bri
tain, but we fee nothing of what Great-Britain
has gained by the reparation, and yet (he has
gained very considerably, and rather more than
America has to boast ofâThe million and a half
which America nfed to cost the mother country
annually, is entirely.laved, and all the hazard of
being again engaged in a war as her friend and
ally, is at an end. The 600, qoc tonnage of ship
ping usually employed in that trade, are now en
tirely Britiih bottomsâwhereas before they were
nearly one half American. And the 600,000 tons
which it was fairly eltimated at in the time of
peace formerly, is now encreafed to above 800,000
tons ; and as to the trade with America, we have
jult as much as we can supply ; and tho' fomc
times the orders are not complied with, yet this
circumstance fbews that we have more of their
trade than we like, as we please ourselves in it,
and take just as much of it as we please.
Our loss by quitting the American colonies,
may really be said to be only a fort of feather of
sovereignty, which, for all the croaking of the
deceased Dr. Price and his parry, it may be doubt
ed whether, when every thing is considered, it
did England any good upon the whole.

Extratt of a letter from George-Town, dated 0(1. 2fw
*' The public sale of lots in the Federal City,
ended on Wednesday evening ; but the private
sales Itill continue,and probably will all the week.
In the whole, there have been at least 1200 lots
fold.âThe average of the public sales is some
thing upwards of 1001. for a lot of 40 feet front
and 130 or 140 deep. The sales made by indivi
duals, I fufpedl, were at a lower rate. Indeed
they have fold, in many parts of the city, and the
public sales were confined to that part which lies
between the President's square and George-Town,
which, it is imagined, will be firft improved, be
ing so convenient to the present feat of trade.
Tell your friend , that it is not yet too late
to make good speculations ; but that, if he means

PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY, November I.
ORDER OFTHE DAY â THE PRESIDtNT's SPEECH.
MR. SEDGWICK said that the lad feifion of
Congress, the House of Representatives by
the appointment of committees, to which almolt
every <*bjeÂ»st of difcuflion in the Prelident's Speech
was referred, so far monopolized the public bu-
Unefs, that during great part of the feilion, the
Senate had very little to attend to.
He thought it of importance that a ftmilar in
terference fhonld be avoided the present Session.
He then recapitulated the principal objects re
commended to the attention of Congress in the
Speech; and informed the House it had been inti
mated to him, that the Senate proposed to take in
to consideration the fubjeifts of the Mint, Weights
and Measures, Consuls, eleiftion of President and
Vice-Prefident,and the eltablifhinent of LandOfli
ces. The House therefore, if' they thought pro
per, might avoid a primary difcuflion of these
fubjeifts, and employ their deliberations on other
important parts of the speech. Some of these
the House had already provided for. by the ap
pointment of committeesâothers remained to be
attended toâamong these, the reference in the
Speech to the excise law he thought of very ma
terial coniequence, and accordingly moved that
a committee should be appointed to take into
consideration, that part of the Preftdent's Speech
which relates to the carrying that law into exe
cutionâand to report such circum!iances in the
law, as may, with confirtenty, be so altered as to
remove any well intentioned objections againfl it;
alto to ascertain and report whether there exists
a due proportion between the duties on foreign
spirits and those >>f domeUic manufacture.
Mr. Boudinot observed, that it (truck liiin as
an impropriety for the House to receive any
information from the Senate except through an
appointed medium ; this informal mode, if it
was allowed, would be a bad precedent and pro
ductive of great einbarraflment ; the difficulty
which has been mentioned might be avoided by
the appointment of a joint committeeâwhich he
thought to be the moil eligible mode.
Mr. Sedgwick replied that he meant only to
convey to the House the information lie had re
ceived, which he supposed was of importanceâ
he had no intention of eltablifhing a precedent.
Mr. Lawrance called for the reading of the
Speech, which being readâcommittees were ap
pointed on the several articles as ftatcd in our
last.
Mr. Sedgwick's motion occasioned considerable
debate ; Mr. Steele moved an amendment bv in
ferring the Secretary of the Treasury in lieu'of a
Committee. 1 his officer he observed was more
competent than any other person to give informa
tion on the fubjeJt, as he had paid the molt mi
nute attention to the operation of the law preju
dices,he said, were entertained against: theSecreta-
J y, on account of his having originally drafted the
lawâthese prejudices hewifhed should be remov
ed, as he was well fitisfied that it was the wjfh of
the House, as well as ofthe Secretary that every
reasonable objection against the lawihould be re
moved.
The motion for a reference to the Secretary
was supported by Mr. White, Mr. Lawrance
M l "' r â¢ Smith Mr " A " ies >
Mr. VVilliamfon.
Mr. Sedgwick contended for a Commi-tee â¢
he was supported by Mr. Vining, Mr. Parker'
Mr. Boudinot, and Mr. Goodhue j on this lide
.' h n e . < l ucftion h was urged that there wasa ma
lufelt impropriety and want of respect in refer
ring any part of the Present's Speech, or a Law
of the Union to the head ot any particular de
partment ; that the information to be derived
from the Secretary, would of course be received
by a committee, and by them be communicated
to the House.
P , r ! re,,t considerations
.hat ffiould arrest the particular attention of the
-egiflatuie, as they only wltc competent to de
ciding upon them. The motion has reference
to the rate of duties, and the House was cer
tainly the molt competent to judge of and clti
mate the public taxes. Â° ' CKl '
After some further debate Mr. SecW.ck with
drew Jus propositionâand a motion by Mr Ames
for a reference to the Secretary of the Treafu, y
In^ ornla ''on refpeifting any difficulties in the
execution of the Law, was agreed to.
1 he business of Offices for the sale' of vacant
Lands within the Territory of the United States,
being considered as particularly connected with
revenueâa committee of the lioufe was appoint
ed to prepare and report a bill, or bills on that
fubjeet.
WEDNESDAY, November 2.
A number of petitions were read and referred.
Mr. Giles called up a memorial from the offi
cers of the Virginia line, and other papers rela
tive thereto, which were communicated by the
Prefiilent, to the late Congress, but not ac'ted up
on. The papers being read, he laid on the table
the following- refolutiou :
That so much of the melfage and communica
tion' from the Prefidenr of the United States to
both houses, 011 the 17th of January lalt, as re
lates to the bounty lands granted to the officers
and soldiers of the Virginia line 011 the continen
tal establishment, be referred to a feleft commit
tee, to examine the matter thereof, and report
the fame with their opinion thereon to the house.
On motion of Mr. Dayton, it was resolved, that
the Secretary of the Treasury be diredted to re
port to the House, whether any and what altera
tions in favor of the fpiiits which fliall be diftill
erl from articles of the growth or produce of the
United States, or from foreign articles within the
fame, can, in his opinion, be made in the excise
law, confidently with its main design, and with
the maintenance of the public faith.
Mr. Giles laid on the table a motion, that the
Secretary of the department of War, thould be
inftrutfted to before the House an accurate
Uateinent of all balances of pay which appear,
by the bouks of his office, to be due to the officers
and soldiers of the late army of the United States,
and which either remain unclaimed, or have been
claimed but not paid ; together with the reasons
for with-holding payment from those who may
have i efpec r tively entered their claims therefor.
Mr. Vining laid on the table a motion for the
appointment of a committee, to report a bill or
bills, to eiiablilli an uniform system of bankrupt
cy throughout the United States.
Mr. Dayton laid on the table a motion, that
the board of cominiflioners, for fettling the ac
counts between the United States and individual
States, be directed to report to the House the pro
gress ihey have made in such settlement ; and
iheir opinion as to the profpeift which the present
state of the business affords, of its speedy and fi
nal conclusion.
Mr. Smith then called for the order of the day,
pursuant to which,
Tlie House resolved itfelf into a committee of
tlie whole (Mr. Muhlenberg in thi chair) and
took up the bill for the enumeration of the in
habitants of the diltridt of South-Carolina.
Some gentlemen having exprelTed their appre
hensions, that, by the words of the bill, the inar
flial of ihe diftriet of South-Carolina might be
empowered to make a new enumeration of the
inhabitants, which was contrary to the sense of
the House, and would give that State an undue
advantage over the other States, an amendment
was moved and adopted by the committee, in the
following words, " Provided that in the said re
turn" [oj of t/je inhabitants of the
tliflrifl of S. Carolina] " such persons only shall
be included, as were inhabitants of the State at
the time prescribed for taking the census," &c.
Another amendment being also proposed and
adopted, the committee rose and reported the
bill as amended.
The House tlien proceeding to consider the
aniendincmsof the committee,fome remarks were
made, to.lhew that the one above quoted might
tend to violate the return, and was moreover an
unnecetlary precaution,as the proposition was not
for making the enumeration of the whole State
but of giving in the return of the enumeration
already made, and completing the census, bv
the addition of a very small diltrift, that was not
yet included in thegeneral return. The amend
ment was therefore rejected by the House, and
the bill was ordered to be engroOed.
Mr. Gerry from t!ie committee to whom
referred the memorial of the iheriffof Suffolk
county, in the State of MafFachufetts, made a re
port tending to grant to all persons, confined in
any State, under the authority of the United
States, the fame privileges and immunities, to
which they would be eniitled, if confined under
the authority of the State. Ordered to lie on
the table.

Several petitions being presented for the r,

Sedgwick observed that it would, in his opinion
be the 111 oft eligible method to take up the Tub!
jest at largeâand he accordingly moved that a

was that the prayer of said petition cannot be

ORDER OF THE DAY âTHE CENSUS.
In committee of the whole.
Mr. Muhlenberg in the chair.
The motion of Mr. Lawrance was again lead,
viz. [ hat until the next enumeration of the in
habitants of the United States, there shall be one
reprefentaiive for every thirty thousand peifons.
Mr. Sedgwick moved to insert the word four,
between thirty and thousand.
Mr. Dayton moved to ilrike out thirty before
tlioufand, and leave the blank to be filled up.
Mr. Livermore moved to insert forty thousand.
Mr. Clark observed, that it was well known
that great unealinefs prevailed among the people
in various parts of the Union, on account of the
salaries and coinpenfations to the officers of go
vernmentâ the expence of supporting the govern
ment was increasingâand it mult therefore be
contrary to the general willies of the people to
enlarge the representation, which would add to
the public burthen, without being productive of
any advantage.
He was in favor therefore of the motion for
fti iking out thirty, and would then move to infect
forty.
Mr. Williatnfon, after a few preliminary re
marks on the ieveral calculations that different
members had made, and applying the various re
sults to the population of the fniall Stares in par
ticular, observed, that futh a ratio fliould be 2-
dopted as would leave the feweft fractions, and
at the fame time do as much justice as pofllble to
those Slates. With refpec't to the general quel - -
tion, lie thought the people were divided in opi
nionâ feme were in favour of a large reprefen
tatioHâothers were opposed t.j a great addition
to the prefei.t number. The expence of fupport
mg the government is greatâthe peojjle realize
that in the nature of things it mult encreafeâthis
consideration should lead to adopt a medium, and
if poflible to fix on a ratio that might give gene
ral fatisfadiion. At all events he wished that
Congress would reserve to itfelf the powerofen
creafing the number of Reprel'entatives, in cafe
the sentiments of the people should be in favor
of the measure. He observed that the l.oweft
number of Conftitnents which had been menti
oned was thirty thousand, and the lugbeft fortyâ
if gentlemen could not agree in either, he hopd
they would adopt the medium.
Mr. Lawrance objecfted to ftrikingout thirt'
1 iiis fubjetft, laid he, has been canvalTel
throughout Americaâinnumerable are the pam
phlets and newspaper publications which have
appeared in all parts of the United States. T ,e
final lnef's of the representation was early objccld
toâand it was verv generally expected, that when
tlie amendments to the Conllitution took plaee,
that one Reprefcntative to every 30, cOO perfoÂ« s
would be the ellabliflied ratio.The majority of the publications on this f;ihje&âthe various
amendments proposed by the States, all plainly declare that the
fenfeof the people is in favor of one for every 30.000.
And what, fa id he, are the objc&ions ? â It is said that the pub-
Jic business will be impeded by a large number of members in the
house and that the ex pence will encreafe the public burthens of
ihc people. With refpeft to the firft obje&iÂ®n, it seems to be a
general idea of gentlemen, that about ico members would be the
most eligible numberâthe proposed ratio will give about 11 ;an
addition of ten or twelve cannot embarrass th'e public business.
The objr&ion on account of an encreafe of the expence, he did not
confidcr as well founded. The encreafe of the rep: efentation will
be in proportion to the encreafe of the people who pay tor the
support ot the government.
Theobjeftion he could not consider therefore of fiifficient weight
to deter Congress from establishing such a ratio as would give a re
prefentauon iuiiy competent to doing full juftite to every pare oi
the Union.
The government is a government by reprefentatio.i, and it is of
thelaft importance that the confidence of the people ihould be in
lpired by feeling that their interests are fully represented.
Mr. Lawrance observed, that eucreafing the ratio would un
doubtedly excite unealinefs and complaint in some of the States,
by diminishing their present representation. He concluded by
faying that the few remarks he had made, were crude and undi
gested not expelling the fubjett to be brought forward this day,
he had not revolved it fufificiently in his mindâhe hoped howe
ver that what had been said, would prevent a sudden decmon of
thequeftion.
Mr. Giles moved that the committe fliould rife, report, and
a(k leave to fit again. The motion was agreed to.
On motion of Mr. Boudinot, it was resolved, that the report of
the Attorney-General on the Judiciary Systemâalso sundry pro
positions on the fame fubjett, as amendments to the Conllitution,
which were laid before the late Houseâbe referred to the com
mittee of the wholeâand that 100 Copies of cach be printed.

ALBANY, Oi'.iober 24.
It is with the mud infinite regret, we announce
the premature and premeditated death of so wor
thy a character as Cornelius Hogkboom, Esq.
Sheriff of the county of Columbia, whole disposi
tion and eondudt, not only in the walks or fecial
and private life, were such as to gain him the
friendfhip and refpe<Tt of all his intimate acquaint
ance, but whose lenity in his official capacity,was
such as ought to have made friends of all who
lenew his benevolent character. âThe circum
stances attending this much lamented event, as
related to us, are as follow
" Saturday last, Cornelius Hogebooj?i, Esq. She
riff of the county of Columbia, iiccompanietl by
two other gentlemen, went to the faie of some
property, legally ndvertifed, in the town of No
bletown, expecting that his deputy had arrived
there before him and had commenced the sale.
When he came to the spot, he found that his de
puty had not been thereâwaited a considerable
timeâdeputy did not arriveâadjourned the sale
'to a future dayâmounted with his companions
âa pistol immediately dischargedâno notice ta
ken of it by either of themâproceeded about jo
yards from the houfe-âfifty (or thereabouts)
-armed men, difguilcd like Indians, started up out
â of the buftiesâfired a shot from thu whole with
out effect !âMr. Hogeboom said to his compani
ons, " they only mean to frighten us' âa lecond
charge was fired, when Mr. Hogeboom received
the fatal (hor, and liad time only to fay, " I am
a dead man."
This, of all murders within our knowledge,
fee ins to lie the moll horrid !âA public officer le
turning, not from thedifcharge of his duty, but
before it had been executed, murdered by aco>v
arclly set of afl'affins, who had taken upon them
the appearance of savages, a badge, which even
nature did not entitle them to ; and under this
garb perpetrated a crime far below the meanness
of savage brutality !
This is one of the numerous instances which
frequently occur, either ot the lols of life 01
some pevfonal iujury being fuitained by public
officers in the legal discharge of their duty. \V e
would not presume to reform, but there is a tan 1 '
somewhereâthere can therefore be noitiipropr
ety in fuggelting an enquiry
This day, obfei ves a correfpondenr, the fecotid
Congress under our tree constitution, are ro meet
in Philadelphia,after a recess of nearly 8 months.
On this occasion it mud occur to every onf, the
clamor that was made two years part, re/petting
'he exorbitant naf*esofthe members ofCongrc s.
If under the nev/ fyftein, Congress can dispatch
the business ot the Union by litting one third of
the year, they will be less burthenfome to the
Union til in the Congress under the old confede
ration, who were a perpetual bodyâto a very
final] purpole.
It gives us lingular pleasure to have it iu our
power to inform the public, iit.it 011 Friday last
ac the trial of Mr. Molter, proprietor of theglafs
h . ife, that gentleman wa/ acquitted. After hear
ing the evidence, it was deemed umiecellary, by
the counsel on each (ide, to fay any tiling either
pro or con ; and the jury without hefitauon de
clared his innocence of the charge.
CARLISLE, October 26.
Last week the courts of quarter-felfions and
common-pleas were holde'n at tliis place for the
fii ll time under the new constitution of this com-
monwealth.âA charge, adapted to the occasion,
was delivered to the grand jury, by Thomas
Smith, Esq. prefie'ent of the circuit.âHe after
wards addreiled the officers of the court, and the
gentlemen of the bar, and after stating briefly
and in general terms, the fcveral duties of each,
he added, " Let us conclude, by iinpreHing upon
the minds of all our fellow-citizens, of every
class, vrhofe duty it is to attend at court, that it
is only by our united exertions in a punctual, di
ligent and faithful discharge of the duties of our
several Rations, that the real dignity of the court
can be supported ; and jtilhce administered to
the fatisfaCtion of the public."
The couwfel who firlt addrefled the court, be
ginning with the words, " Ma'y it please your
honours," the pieftdent requested him to post
pone the motion tor a tew minutes, and made ihe
following obfervaiions : " The gentlemen of
the bar frequently use this expression in addrefl
ing this court but the appellation not being
given to us by the conltitution or laws of our
country, it will be agreeable to the court, if you
decline giving it in future. The expression "this
honorable court," has indeed crept into one of
our aCts of Membly :âShould that form of ad
dress be used in the other circuits, we fliall not
fay that it is improper. For, as on the one hand,
it would be falfe niodefty, or rather falfe pride,
under Ihe inalk of inodelty, to refufe any titles
(riven 11s by the conltitution or the laws ; so on
â the other, it would disclose uninformed minds,
ihould we arrogate to ourselves appellations not
given by either.
" If we poflef's fufficient legal abilities, and an
intimate and accurate knowledge of the practice
âif we administer the laws with decision, dif-
Adjourned,
patch, and rigid integrityâ if we consult and pro
mote the real and permanent jnterelts, an'd locial
happinafs of our fellow-citizens, as far as in our
power, in our present itation, they will refpeift
us without any titles !âBut fliould we appear un
equal to our officeâ(hould we betray the want of
legal abilities, or ihould our judgments be led or
influenced by our affections, or passions, or by
any pcrfonal or party considerations, 110 titles or
appellations, however pompous, could secure to
us the refpert of an enliplitened people.
" We beg leave on this occasion to point, out
another impropriety, ot which, indeed, 1 was as
guilty as any of you when I was at the bar, al
though 1 scarcely ever was in the other inltance:
The gentlemen in whole favor the courtgave
judgment, generally rife and thank the court. We
reoueil you will discontinue this practice ; were
the counsel on the other lide to fay, wc blame the
court, the expression would certainly be thought
improperâthe one indeed Hows from politeness
the other would be looked upon as rude ; in
every other point of view they are equally ex
ceptionable.
" We mull give judgement according to law
we could not give it otherwise than we do, to
â¢rain the applause or to shun the cenlure of mil
lions we mull be actuated by considerations in
finitely higher than the applause or cenlure of
men. God forbid that any of the parties in this
court, or in any of the other courts which 1
fit, should ever have it in his power to lay, with
truth, either that he has a jrietid or an enemy on
the bench."
The remains of the wid jvv of the late Bishop
of Durham were 011 Tuesday brought from Wan

A southern pnper by yesterday's mail informs, that the Court
Martial which (at for the trial of General Harmar j has acquitted
him with honor.
By the Boston Independent Chronicle, it appears that the town
ofÃofton has voted in town meeting, to inftruft their representa

At a meeting of the Dire&ors of the Bank of the United States,
on Wednesday evening, the following Gentlemen were appointed
a committee to prepare and report a plan for Offices of Discount,
viz. Wii lt am Smith, Jonathan Mason, William Bing

In consequence of the late daring attempts to burn this city, the
most fpiritted measures have been adopted to guard against the in
cendiariesâ and to deteÂ£l and bring them to justice, patroles of ci
tizens are formed in the several wards, whole nightly vigilance
will secure the repose and preservation of the inhabitants, and their
property.
On Monday last Joseph Ravar a, Esq. was introduced to the
President, by Mr. Jefferfon. as Consul-General in the United
States from the Republic of Genoa.
Within thefc tew nights pafl several attempts have been made to
set fire to buildings in different, parts of the city, bit they were
happily fruftrated bv the a&ivity of the citizens, different parties
of whom have patrolled the streets for the purpose of preventing
those diabolical incendiaries from executing their horriddcfigns.
His Excellency Governor Clinton has ifiued a proclamation
offering a large reward for apprehending and securing the mur

The Constitution of France was exaflly two years, three months,
and fifteen davs in formingâthe empire of despotism, on the ru
ins of which this fabrick of Freedom is raised, was the work of
ages. At the moment of finifhmg the Constitution, all parties
seemed to uniteâFeuillans and Jacobins joined in equal expreflions
of triumph.
The motion of Mr. Languinais, that the Constitution cannot be
changed, was carried unanimously.
SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
In consequence of the success of the Boston Tontine, a plan for
an United States Tontine will be published in a few days, in all the
principal towns throughout the Continent; and as the objedfc is to
effect a union of public and private benefits, there can be little
doubt of its fuccceding.
A fvftem of Bankrupt Laws has long been expected by many
persons. It has been said that the United States is almost the on
ly civilized country in the world, which is not in poffeflion of
such a fvftem ; an idea is excited by this circumstance, which
fomc may construe to the disadvantage of the general character of
the people of America. If we can boast of equal honesty with
the reft of mankind, we do not appear to Hand on an equal foot
ing with the citizens of European government in this refpeft.
There may be peculiar difficulties attending this business in this
country, owing to the extenfivenefs of our circle of credit; but
we certainly in this cafe, as in many others, enjoy fupertor ad
vantages by having all the light to direst us, which can arise from
the practice and experience of the greatest commercial, and moll
enlightened nations of Europe.
It is doubtless for the intercft of individuals and communities,
that men should pursue the paths of honor and re&itude. An en
lightened people will always make it for the advantage of their
public officers to be honest and patriotic. How highly favoured
is our country, in having those to conduct her public affairs, whÂ®
feel the force of the above remark.âOn every occasion, the pro
moting the public good will be the supreme motivp to a&ion, so
long as\he people distinguish worth and abilities by their fuffrages.
On the 2 ift ult. at a meeting of the American PhilofophicalSociety,

Whv with thy myft'ries aw I not delighted,
Which I have try'd to peep on half my life ?
God ot the down-clad chains, dispel the mistâ
O put me fpcedily upon thy lift !
A civil lift, like that of Kings, I'm told,
Bringing in swelling bags ot glorious gold !
What hnve I done to lose thy good opinion ?
Agamft thee was 1 ever known to rail;
And (ay, (abusing thus thy sweet dominion)

Which, like Jack Ketch's, seldom Hips till death.

Deep coughing by the taper's lonely light,
The hopeless He&ic rolls his eyeballs, sighing :
" Sleep on," he cries, and drops the tend'reft tear;
Then kifTcs his wife's cherub cheek so dear :
" Blest be thy (lumbers, Love ! tho I am dying,
Ah ! whillt thou flcepctt with the fwectell bieath,

Soon mull thou wander from ihy wife away.
" Dread found ! too folc mn for the foul to bear,

And fullen âlingering, as if loth to part,
And cafe the teirors of my fainting heart.
Yet, tho I pant for life, sleep thou, my dove,
Eor well thy constancy deserves my love."
And, lo! all young and beauteous, by his fide,
His fofi, frelh blooming, incenfe-breathmg Bride,
Whose check the dream of rapt'rous kiflls warms,
Anticipates her spouse's wilh so good ;
Feels love's wild ardours tingling through her blood,
And panis amidst a Jecond husband's arms ;

April 15, 1789,
THE p!an and execution of the Gazette of the United
States, have received ihe approbation of a tribunai, from wtnch
there is no ;ippeal.
The fubfcripiions, which arc rncreafing, have long; since exceed
ed the cxpc&ations of the oublifherâa punctual compliance with
the terms would compensate his labours, aud animate his futuitf
exertions.
The Government that an enlightened and free people adopt, is
a sacred confederal ionâit knows no party âand us prosperity is
founded on the public good.
While the people are juft'.o themselves, the adminiflration of
their affaiis wiil be committed to men of integrity and competent
abilities ; and it will be the duty of patriotism to impress the pub
lic mind with favorable sentiments of the mcalures of govern
ment.
Our country continuing enlightened and free, the period can.
not be anticipated when a publication on the plan of this Gazette
shall involve a dercliftion of those principles with which the li
berties and happiness of the United States are conneffed.
(t. f.)
With refprft to the circulation of this paper, the Editor regrets
the recent disappointments which have unavoidably taken placeâ
he has always been fully imprerted with the importance of punc
tuality. and cannot charge himfelf with a finale lnllance of re
mi (Kiefs.
It is very generally luppofed that Congress, at the ensuing
feflion, will take measures to ensure the circulation of news
papers in the United States; ariji particularly their tranfmiflion
from the Seat of Government to all parts of the Union. Jultice,
policy and patriotism, plead irrefiflably in favor of iOme ctteÂ£lual
provision's being made. The following pertinent and judicioirs
observations on this fubjecl, lately appeared in an address to the
public from the Editor of the Gazette of Maine, They
are lublliturcd in preference to any thing which the editor of this
paper might further suggest, more particularly as coming from a
remote quarter of the Union.
** Perhaps there is no country, in any part of the world, the in
habitants of which arc, (or may be) supplied with public News
papers at a cheaper rate than ihofe of America. The Farmer and
the Merchant, the Laborer and the Mechanic, may, bv the mean's
or a public Paper, when he retires from the business and fatigued
ot the day, take a view of the (ituation, the circumltauces and the
various Â»evolutions of the several countries of the civilized world â
And it must be a pleasing circurnftance, that this is theprivilege,
emphatically the privilege of an American.
Let it therefore be remembered, that by virtue of this privi
lege, the body of the pcoplf constantly obtain and prefeive such a
degrte ol knowledge as (hall be competent to the prevention of
any attempt that may be made by cunning and design ng men to
lap the foundation of our moll invaluable conflitution. But, let
the circulation of these Vehicles of Public Information bccircum
fcribed, and the people will at once become uninformed of public
tranfaflions, and the more enlightened Jew will engrofsthe privi
legts, immunities and prerogatives, which in the nature and
of things, arc the indefejfibic right of the whole body of ihc
peoplp.
It is pr^futried no American will need a ftimtilus of tbis na
ture to furnilh himfclt with public information. The cheap rate
at which it is offered, the love and'glory of our country, will at
all tunes promote such a mode of condudf, as shall forever bar the
attempts of tyranny, ignorance and fupcillhion."
