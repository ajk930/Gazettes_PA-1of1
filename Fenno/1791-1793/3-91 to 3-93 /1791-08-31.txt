A Deputation from the diftrift of Clermont dated frcfli parti
culars relating to the capture of the King.
M. Damas undertook by order of M. Bouille, to protrft his
flight; but, abandoned by his dragoons, he was himfelf obliged
to fly.
The King had a passport, of which this is a copy :
44 On the part of the King.

M. Montmorin was ordered to the bar, to (late by whom and
how this passport was granted. He endeavored to exculpate him
felf, by faying, he had been futprifed.
Friday Night.
The fitting was opened by the report of the Commiflioncrs
charged to examine the condufl of M. Montmorin with refpe&io
the King's passport.
The Commidioncrs stated, that having examined the rcgifters,
they had found that the passport had been obtained at the request
of M. Simolin, the Ruflian Ambalfadoi in France.
A deputation of the Municipality of Paris prefentcd to the Af
the two citizens who Hopped the King.
then gave the following recital :
RffwFn the Postmaster of Sainte Menehoud, formerly a dra
the regiment of Conde. My comrade, William, wa&
â H|v a dragoon of the Queen's regiment.
|HW5n the 8i ft of June, at half past ieven o'clock in the evening,
two carriages and eleven horses baited at my house I thought 1
recognized the Queen; and perceiving a man at the back part of
the carriage, on the left, I was struck with the resemblance of his
countenance to the King's .effigy on an aflignat of 50 ,
" These carriages were conduced by a detachment of dragoons,
which succeeded a detachment of hussars, under pretence of pro
te&inga treasure. This escort confirmed me in my suspicions;
particularly when I saw the commander of ihe detachment fpea&
with great animation to one ot the couriers. However, fearing
to exciteJalfe alarms, being alone and having no opportunity of
consulting any one, I fuffcred the carriages to depart.
" But feeing immediately the dragoons making
to follow them, and observing that, after having alk<d horles for"!
Verdun, the carriages took the road to Varennes, I went a cross
joad, in order to rejoin them
" I arrived be fore them at Varennes. It was eleven o'clock at
light, very dark, and ev.ery one gone to bed. The carnages were
Hopped in a street, by a difputc which h,d taken place between
the poflillions and the poft-rnaller of the place. The pott-maltcr
was desirous that they should (lop and rctneth their horses accord
ing to custom. The King, on the conti arts,* was desirous to hasten
his departure. t
â¢' I then said to my comrade, " Are you a staunch patriot!"
44 Don't doubt it," replied he. " Well (said I) the King is at
Varenues. He muff be flopped.'' We then alighted, and re
fle&ed, that in order to secure success to oar plan, it was necessary
to barricade the street artd the bridge by which the King was to
pals.
" My companiQn and I then went to the bridge of Varenncs;
fortunately there was a carriage there loaded with furnitureâwe
overturned it, so as to render the road impassable ; we then ian to
feck, the Procureur de la Commune, the mayor, the commandant
of the national guard, and in a few minutes our number increafcd
to eight men, who were all hearty in the cause.
" The commander of the national guard, accompanied by the
procureur, approached the carriage, asked the travellers who they
were, and where thev were going ? The Queen answered that they
were in a hurry. A fight 01 the passport was then demanded.
She at length gave her passport to two guards of honour, who
alighted and came to the inn.
" When the passport was read, some said it was fufficientâwe
combated this opinion, bccaufe it was not signed by the President
of the National Affcmbly, as it should have been. If you are a
foreigner, said we to the Queen, how came you to have fufficient
influence to have a detachment lo follow you ? How come you,
when you passed through Clermont, to have fulHcicnt influence to
be followed by a firft detachment ?
*' In consequence of these reflections, and our perseverance, it
was determined that the travellersJhould not proceed till the follow
ing day. Thev alighted at the house of the procurcur.
" Then the king said to us, ' I am the King ! Thcfe are my
wife and children ! We conjure you to treat us with that refpeft
â which the French have ever (hewn their Kings!
4t The national guards immediately came in crowds, and at the
fame time the huilars arrived sword in handâthey endeavored to
approach the houfc where the King was, but we let them know,
that if they persisted in taking him away, they (hould not tear him
from us alive.
41 The commander of the national guard* had the precaution to
bring up two (mall field-pieces, which he planted at the upper
end of the fticei, and two others at the lower end, so that the huf
fdrs were between two fires. They were fummoricd to dismount.
M. Jouglas refufed ; he said, that he and his troop would guard
the Km# ; he was answered, that the national guards would guard
him without his. affiftjnee. He persisted in his resolution ; upon
which the commander of the national guards gave orders to the
gurineis to form their ranks, and to fiie. They tdok the matchcs
in tfieir handsâbut the cannons were not then loaded.
41 In a word, the commander of the national guaids, and the
national guards, acted so judiciously, that they contrived to dis
arm thehuflars. The King was then made a prifoncr f
" Having thus fulfilled our duty, we returned home, amidst the
applause of oi.r fellow-citizens ; and we are comc to lay before
the National Aflcmbly ;he homage of our Cervices/*
FRANCE
MONTMO R I N."
The President congratulate :hcfe brave citizens on the eininen;
fi-rvice they had rendered to iheir vountry.
The meeting was then suspended.
Satur day, Jure 25,
The Aflrmhly paSTe-d the toilowing decrees :
1. The K-ng, on hts return to the Chateau des Thuilleries, (hall

MONDAYy J une 2 7*
M. Tronchet gave, in the name of the three Commiflioncrs ap
points d to receive the declarations of the King and Queen, the
f 'Mowing account of the manner in which they had executed their
coninnflion :
LOUIS
" For the purpose of executing your decree of yesterday, M.
Dandre, M. Duport, and I, met ; und, about nine in the evening,
proceeded to the Thuiilerus. We were introduced into the
King's apartment, where we found him alone. After having read
to him your decree, I judged it receffary to remark, that the de
claration of his Majesty (hould re er according to the intent and
meaning of the decree, as well to all the tranfa&ions of the 21 It
of June, as to the occurrences coinetted with them, whether of
an interior or posterior dare. king answered, that he did
not undciftand submitting to interrogatories ; but that he would
deliver in a declaration conformably to the requ:fition which had
been made to him by the National Assembly. We then took his
declaration, to every page of which he had fel his fignalure. We
went afterwards to the apat tments of the Queen, whom we found,
w itn Madame Elizabeth, preparing to fit down to table ; but,
the latter informing us that her Majesty could not then receive us,
because she was going to the bath, we dcfircd her to appoint ano
ther hour; and she fixed upon eleven this morning. Ot course,
wc retired ; but, re urntng at the time prefci ibed, were intro
duced into the bed-chamber, where the Queen was without any
one attendant whatever. Wc then read to her the decree of the
National Assembly, subjoining to it the fame obfeivation which
wc had made to the Kii.g. She dittated to us her declaration,
and, having afterwards heard it read over, put her signature to
every page of it."
DECLARATION OF THE KING.
* 11 1 obfervc, Gentlemen, by your commiflion, that nothing
jjike an interrogatory is meant ; but I am dcfirous of complying
1 with the wifties of the National Aflemblv, and I shall never de
i the motives of myconduft. The motives for my
journey were the outrages and the threats offered to my family
and to myfclf on the 18th of last April ! fubfequentto that period,
I and kÂ»y family have frequently been infultcd and menaccd in se
veral writings ; and the authors of ihefe have remained unpun
ished. I conceived that the fafety of my family, and of my own
pcrfon, forbade me to continue any longer in Paris. I wished
to leave it ; and it was for the purpose of departing with less in
terruption, that I preferred the night-time. My intentions never
were to quit the kingdom. I had not concerted any measures
whatsoever, either with foreign powers, or with the French emi
grants beyond the kingdom. The circumstance of apartments
having been prepared for my reception at Montmedy, may be
adduced as a proof that I had no design to pass beyond the fron
tiers. I chose this place, because, as it was fortified, my family
might have remained there in security ; and because, being thus
near the frontiers, I (hould have been more at hand to resist every
attempt to invade France. Here, in the cafe of an invalion, I
could immediately have prefentcd myfelf in the poll of danger,
"n short, I chose Montmedy even in the moment when I might
havechofen any other retreat. One of my principal motives was
to re-cftabliih the vigor of the g vernment, and to render my'ell
fftfure. Had I felt an inclination to depart from the kingdom, I
(hould not upon the very fame day, have sent my declaration to
the National Assembly, but I should have waited for the moment
of my having palled beyond the frontiers. I always adhered to
ihe desire of returning to Paris. It is in this sense that the last ex
preflions of my memorial (hould be undcrftood :âFrenchmen, and
above all, citizens oj Paris, what pfeafuie Jhall I feel to be among you !
I had not, in the cariiage, more than the sum of 13,200 livrcs in
gold, and 560,000 livres in aflignats ; and these were incloicd
within the port-folio which has been returned to me by the de
partment.
" I did not communicate my intentions to Monsieur until
within a ftiort time previous to my departure ; and he only pro
ceeded into a foreign State with the intention of returning to
Montmedy, but without taking the fame road. Several days be
fore I had cfdered the three persons who attended me, to provide
themselves the dreftes of couriers, in which they might bear my
difpatrhes. It was not until the preceding evening that I told
them they were to accompany me. I only took a paflport for
going out of the kingdom, becauie none is granted at the Office
for Foreign Affairs for the inter ior parts of the kingdom : neiihei
was the road marked out even at all pursued. I never made an\
other protections than those which I addrefTed to the aflembl
on the day of my departure ; and these do not bear so much up
on the ground work of the principles of the constitution as upon
i he torm of fanthons, upon the deficiency of that freedom which
I ought to enjoy and upon the point, that as the constitutional de
crees were not presented to me in one mass, I could not poflibly
Judge of them in a collected view, and altogether. The princi
pal part of this memorial rcits upon the defeat of the administra
tive and executive mcafures. I was sensible, during my journey,
that the public opinion was decidedly in favor of the conltiiution.
I did not conceive that I could fully have ascertained the nature
of this public opmion at Paris; but upon the road, and in con
fcquence of all the elucidations, which, as the result of my en
quiries, flafliea upon my mind, I became convinced, as I now
am, how indifpenfibly neceflary it is even for the constitution to
give power to those officers of the fiatc who are appointed for tie
maintenance of public order. As soon as I could afceitain the
141
[Whole No. 244.]
nature of the public opinion, I did not Ik lit ate to facriiicc my
peilonal inteveft.s to the welfare ol my people, this being the
great object ol all m/wi.Qiesand desires.
tf I shall willingly forget all the unpleasant circumstances that
I have experienced, to fecucc the peace aud the happiness of the
nation."
[The King, after reading this declaration, observed, " That he
had omitted to add, that his Son's Governess, and the Ladies in
his suite, were apprized of his departure but a short time only
before it took place ; and the King signed it with us.]]
(Signed) LOUIS,
Tkonchet, Dukort, Dandre,"
D ECLAT lON OF THE QUEEN.
tc I declare, that the King being dcfirous of quitting Paris with
his children, nothing in nature could have dissuaded me from
following him ; for, that I never will consent to quit him, my
whole conduct for these two years past, has given fufficient proof#.
I was confirmed in my determination to follow him, from the
confidence and persuasion which I had, that he would never quit
the kingdom. Had he been lo inclined, all my influence would
have been exerted to prevent I im. The Govemefs of my daugh
ter, who "jhad been indisposed for five weeks did not receive or
ders for departure till the evening preceding She had not even
taken any clothes with herâl was obliged to lend her someââ 
She was absolutely ignorant of our destination. The three cou
riers neither knew the destination nor the object of the journeyâ
they were fupplicd, from time to time, with money upon ihe road,
and received our orders as we proceeded. The two Jemmes de
chambre did not receive orders till the moment of our departureâ-
One of them, whofc husband was in the Palace, had not an op
portunityof feeing him. Monsieur and Madame separated from
us, and took the road to Mons, onlv to avoid embarrassment,
and to prevent delay from the want of horses upon the roadâThev
weie to rejoin us in France. We went out of the Palace by pac
ing through the apartment of M. Villequier ; and that we might
not be perceived, we went separately, and at some distance of
time from each other."
[After reading over this declaration to the Queen, (he acknow
ledged it to be such a declaration as Jhe intended to make, and
signed it with u .] (Signed).
The Declaration being read, M. Tronchet said, 44 The King
is dHiromto have a duplicate of these declarations; without doubt,
the assembly will authorifc us to deliver thein."
The assembly complied with the r quest, and ordered the de
clarations to the committee which shall be appointed to make a
icport on this affair.
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY,
TO THE FRENCH.
A PROCLAMATION.
Decreed in the fitting of "Juris 22, r 79 r -
" A GRAND offence hasjuft been committed.
The National Aflembly was near the conclusion
of its long labours ! the constitution was ahnoft
completed : the tumults of the Revolution were
about to ceafc ; and the enemies of the public
welfare were eager, by a single crime, to facri
fice the whole nation to their vengeance. The
King and the Royal Family were carried off on
the 21ft inilant.
" Buc your Regrcfentatives will triumph over
all tliis obstacle. eftiriiate calmly the ex
tent of the duties imposed upon them. The pub
lic liberty shall be maintained ; con fpi rat org and
slaves (hall understand the intrepidity ps the
French Nation, and we make, in the name of the
Nation, a solemn engagement to revenge the law,
or die !
" France would be Free, arid she (hall be so.
It is intended to make the Revolution recede,
but it recedes not. âSuch, Frenchmen, is your
willâit (hall be accomplilhed. It is neceflary to
accommodate the law to theftateof the kingdom.
The King, in the Constitution, exercise* the pow
er of the Royal fancftion over the Decrees of Lc
giflative Body , He is the Head of the Executive
Power, and, in that capacity causes the laws to
be executed by responsible ministers.
" If the firft officer of the public deserts lil>
pofl, or is carried off against his will, the Repre
sentatives of the Nation have the right to supply
his place.âThe National Aflembly has, inconfe
qnence, decreed, That the Seal of State, and the
signature of the Minister of JutHce, (ball be ad
ded to all its decrees, to give them the character
of laws. As no order of the King would have
been executed, without being countersigned by
the responsible Mim'lter, nothing was neceflary
but a simple delegation by the Aflembly ro au
thorise him to sign the orders, and those only
i(l'ned by them. In this circumstance they have
been directed by the conlHtntional law relative
to a Regency, which authorises them to perform
the functions of the Executive Power until the
nomination of a Regent
" By thcfc mcnfiircs your Representatives
have infurecl order in the interior part of the
kingdom, and to repulse any attack from with
out. they add to the army a reinforcement of
three hundred thousand National Guards.
" The citizens then have, on all fides, the
means of security. Let them not be overcome
MARIE ANTONIETTE,
Tronchet, Duport. Dandrb."by their surprize ; the Constituent A (Tent My is
upon its duty ; the constituted powtrs are in ac
tivity; the Citizens of Paris,the National Guards,
whole patriotism and fidelity are above all praile,
watch round your Representatives ; the atftive
citizens throughout the kingdom are in arms,anci
trance may wait Jor ill enemies.
" Are they to fear the consequences of a writ
ing, forced before his departure, from afeduced
King : It is difficult to conceive the ignorance
and blindnesS that have dicftated this writing,
whicfi may deserve to be further discussed heie
after ; at present, your Representatives content
themselves with examining some particular sen
timents.
" The National Afiembly has made a solemn
proclamation of political truths, and ot rights,
the acknowledgment of which will one day pro
duce the happiness of the human race ; to en
gage them to renounce this declaration of rights,
the theory of slavery itfelf has been presented to
them
Frenchmen ! we have no fear in recalling
to v.onr memories the famous day, the 23d ot
July, 1789 âthat day, 011 which the Chief of the
Executive Power, the fit ft public functionary of
the nation, dared to dilate his abfoiute will to
your Representatives, charged by your orders to
form a Con(litÂ»tion. The National Aftembly la
mented the difordeis committed on the sth of
Ortober, and ordered the prosecution of the per
sons guilty of them ; but, because it was difficult
to discover fotne rioters amongst such a multitude
of people, they are said to have approved all
their crimes.âThe nation is, however, more jnfl.
It has not reproached Louis XVI. with the vio
lences that have occurred under his Reign, and
tkofe of his ancestors- I
" They are not afraid to call to your recol
lection the Federation of July. What are the
statements of the persons who have dictated the
letter of the King, with respect to this auguftact ?
that the fit It public functionary was obliged to
put himfelf at the head of the Representatives of
the Nation, in the midst of the Deputies of all
the kingdom. He took a solemn oath to main
tain the Constitution. If the King does not here
after declare, that his good faith has been sur
prised by seditious per lons, he lias, of courfe,an
nounced his own perjuty to the whole world ! Is
it necefl'ary to go through the fatigue of answer
ing the other reproaches of this letter ?
" The King is (aid to have experienced some
inconveniencies in his residence at Paris, and not
to have found the fame pleasures as formerly ;
by which it is implied, no doubt, that a nation
ougljt to regenerate itfelfwithout any agitation,
without disturbing for an instant, the pleasures
and thS* indigencies bf courts. As to the ad
drefl.es of congratulation and adherence to your
decrees, these fay they, are the work of the fac
tious.âYesâno doubtâof twenty-six milli
ons of the ftiffions.
â¢' It was necessary to re-conrtitute all powers
because all the powers were corrupted, and be
cause the alarming debts accumulated by the
despotism and the disorders of government, would
have overwhelmed the nation. But does not Roy
alty :xij.l for the people ? And if a great Nation o
ilig'es itfelf to maintain it, ij it not solely becatrfe it
is believed to be ufeful ? The Constitution has left
to the King this glorious preroga 1 ive, and has
confirmed to him the only authority which he
flioulddefire to exercise. Would not your repre
sentation have been culpable, if they had facri
ficed twenty-fix millions to the interest of one
man ?
" The labonr of citizens supports the powers
of the Stare ; but the maxim of absolute power
is, to consider the public contributions as a debt
paid to despotism. The National Aflembly has
regulated its expences with the ftrivfteft justice :
they thought themselves bound, when acting in
the name of the Nation, to a(st munificently ;
and when they were to determine what part'of
the public contributions jhotild be allowed to the
firft functionary, tliirry millions were allotted
for him and the Royal Family ; but this is re
presented ae a trifling sum !
" The Decrees upon the fubjedl of peace and
â war, have taken from the King and his Minis
ters the power of facrificing the people to the
caprices of courts -, and the definitive ratificati
on of Treaties is reserved to the Representatives
of the Nation. The loss o( a prerogative is com
plained of. What prerogative ? That of not be
ing obliged to consult the National will, when
the blood and the fortunes of citizens were to be
facrificed. Who can know the wish and interests
of the Nation better than the Legislative Body >
It is wished to make was with impunity.
But have we not had, under the ancient Go
vernment, fufficient experience of the terrible
effects produced by the ambition of Ministers >
We are acciifed of having def'poiled the King
ill forming the judicial power, as if.the King of
a great Nation ought to appear in the adntini
ftration of justice, for any other purpose than
that of canfing the law to he observed, and its
judgments executed. It is wiflied thnt heflmnid
have the right of granting pardons, and chang
142
ing punishments â¢, but does not all the world
know, how such a right"Would be exercised, and
upon whom the benefit of it would fall ? The
King could not have exercised it by himfelf; and
having prohibited Royal despotism, it was natu
ral to prohibit that of the Ministers.
(( The necetlity of circumstances has sometimes
obliged the National Aflembly to meddle, contra
ry to its inclination, in the affairs of adininillra
tion. It ought not to act, when the government
remained in blame3ble inertness ? It is, theie
fore, necessary to fay, that neither the King nor
the Ministers have the confidence of the nation !
'â¢ The Societies of Friends of the Constitution
have fuppot'ted the Revolution ; they are moie
neceflary than ever, and iome perlons presume
to fay that they govern the administrative bodies,
and the empire, as if they were the deliberating
bodies !
" Frenchmen ! all the powers are organized ;
all the public funftionaties are at their pods ; the
National Allembly watches over the fafety of the
State ? may yon be firm and tranquil ! One dai'
ger alone threatens ns.âYou have to guard a
gainst the suspension of your laboursâagainst
delay in the payment of dntiesâagainft any in
flammatory measures, which commence in anar
chies, and end in civil war. It is to these dan
gers that the National Affenibly calls the attenti
on of the citizen,. In this crisis, all private ani
mosities and private interests should disappear.
" Those who would preserve their liberty,
should show that tranquil firmnefs which appals
tyrants. May the factions, who hope to fee eve
ry thing overturned, find order maintained, and
the Constitution confirmed, and rendered more
dear to Frenchmen, by the attacks made upon it !
The Capital may be ap example to the reft of
France. The departure of the King excited no
disorders there ; but to the confufion of the ma
levolent, the utmost tranquility prevails in it.
" To reduce the territory ofthisempire to the
yoke, it will be necessary to destroy the whole
nation! Despotism if it pleases, may make such
an attempt âIt mill either fail, or at the conclusion
of its triumphs, will find tnly ruins J"
This Address was unanimously approved by the
Affenibly, and ordered to be sent to all the De
partments.
LISLE, June 7.
THE National Guard in the village of Lefquin
flopped an ecclesiastic, who had a conficler
able quantity of louis-d'ors, aifti one bag of Gi
ver, in his carriage, the whole weighing 1691b.
besides this, a quantity of aflignats, and foine
rouleaux of Louis, were found upon his person.
1 his money is said to have been the firlt payment
of a million to be furnifhed by the late Abbot of
St. Benin to the Cardinal de Rohan, to hasten
the pafiage of the Rhine. Thus the counter-re
volution has received another pull-back.
PARIS
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, June 27.
The Conquerors of the Baftile again came to
renew their oath.
M. Troncher, who had jnft received a note
from the King, said that his Majeily desired to
fee the Commiifioners at eleven o'clock ; but, he
added that the Commiifioners did not think it
proper to comply with this desire without the or
ders of the Afiembly. The Assembly ordered
them to wait on the King.
In halfan hour the fame deputy returned, and
said that the Commissioners had found the King
in his bed-chamber, who told them that he had
sent for them to add that he had forgotten, in
his declaration to mention his having given or
ders to M Bouille to protect him on his journey
to Motitmedi.
The Commissioners having told the King that
the Assembly was informed of this circumstance,
his Majesty replied, " I knew not that these or
ders were known. I have nothing more to add ;
my only in'ention was to inform you that 1 had
given those orders."
M. Defmutiiers then made his report, in the
name of the Committee of Constitution, on the
forms to be observed in the choice of a Governor
to the presumptive heir of the crown. One ar
ticle alone was productive of debates. < This was
" whether the Members of the Legislature should
be eligible to this office."
It was at length determined in the negative.
Art I. Previously to the nomination of a Go
vernor to the preemptive Heir of the Crown, a
lift of the citizens qualified for that office, (hall
be drawn up.
Art. 2. The members of the National Aflembly,
divided into Bureaux, lhall make the neceflary
fcruriny. Two Secretaries fiiall add together the
fcrntinies of all the Bureaux. The lift of those
who are qualified fliall be reported to the Aflem
bly, and (hall be primed.
Art. 3. The Election shall be by a plurality of
votes. The votes may be not only for any of
those on the lift, but for any one citizen. No
Members of the National A (lembly fliall be elected.
Art. 4. The Governor appointed shall, before
the Aflembly, take an oath to watch over the
life, and to promote the health of the prefumi
tive heir, and to be refponftble for his perl'oll '
Art. f. All persons in the service of the n
fumptive heir fliall be under the orders of t
Governor.
rfrt. 6. The National Aflembly wiH ; mm .j
ately apply thewfelves to the formation of apl a '~
of education for the prefumpcive heir, in p u ,f u "
ance of a former decree.
At the opening of the evening fitting, a letter
from Dunkirk was read, giving information tint
the officers of the regiment Colonel-General ha 1
run away to Fnrus, and had taken with theili the
colours, and the whole baggage. They had all
attempted, but in vain, to corrupt the soldiers

A Spcrial Meflenger arrived at the Imperial
Ambaflador's on Saturday last, who is one of the
Emperor's body-guards ; he was only (even hours
on his paflage from-Oftend. A long conference
took place between Mr. Pitt and his Excellency
on Monday, in conference of the dispatches he
brought over. The report is, tha: they contsin
ed information that the Emperor has been pre
vailed 011 again to join his forces with those of
Ruflia against the Porreâthat the Danes have de
termined to join Ruflia 111 difpiuing the pafi'age
of the Englilh fleet up the Balti&; and that Swe

Ruflia and this country, to re-commence hoitili
ties against the former.

We feetn to have at length reached the happy
tera, when all the Gothic governments through
out Europe, are to vanish and make room for
governments founded on justice and reason, and
conformable to tlie grand objects, for which so
cieties were originally instituted. Despotism and
Feudality are now at their la (I gasp. Mankind
are determined to be 110 longer led like a herd
of brutes. In lieu of an unnatural inllincft, they
have substituted the light of reason, which now
brings forth to view those rights, that have been
too long concealed frqm the eyes of the people,
and of those w ho govern ihein.
A certain and infallible method of preserving
French beans, potatoes, and other tender vege
tables from being injured by the fpringand funv

the white froft from the plants with a watering
pot of common pond or spring water. The a -
hove has been tried this summer and had the de
sired effect.
A gentleman aged upwards of 60, was, and
had been for some years, violently afflicted with
the stone and gravel in the bladder and kidnies ;
he was advised to eat raw onions, and drink the
juice of the fourefl: crab apples, particularly in
the mornings, and to use as mncli of both as his
stomach and constitution would bear at all times
in the day ; by continuing the use ofthefe things
about a year, he was perfectly cured, and re
mains so to this day without any return of the
complaint, and can now attend his bufinefs,which
before he could nor, from the extremity of the
pain. For those constitutions that cannot so well
bear the strong acid of the crab apple, may be
substituted in its room a jam or conserve made of
the blackberry in its unripe state, while it is of
a red colour ; let the juice or pulp be palled
through a Iteve after the berries have been boil
ed in a covered jar set in a kettle of water for
five or fix horn s over the fire ; to every quart 01
the pulp or juice, thus boiled, add two pound*
of lump sugar, boil and skim it, and so keep so'
use.âDose, a tea spoon full at night, or ofiener,
if the constitution will bear it.

NEXT to the favorable fuffrages of the peo

incentive better calculated to encourage them to
proceed, until they have finally completed their

fiirrouncling nations, who are blinded by preju

We too are eftablilhing (under the constituti
onal authority of a king) that liberty which you
have been able to fecute under governments of a
republican form :â
Liberty, not derived from chartered g ants or
privileges, which ftibverts by the introduction
of het editary distinCtions, that equality of rank,
which in the social state is the unalienable birth-
right of mail : and which, encroaching on the
sacred sovereignty of the people, by pretentions
founded on birth or adventitious rights, ltill ex
hibits, on the bold and resolute features of a re
generated nation, the fears of its ancient Slavery.
A country, fit to receive and nourish the feeds
of this precious liberty, was only to be fought
for in the trans atlantick world :â'Tvvas there,
amongst an infant people, pure, and uncorrupt,
that tbe higher virtues were to be found, fuita
ble to carry into effect, those speculative truths;
against which ignorance and li a bit ual error have
waged continual warfare ; ât ruths, which from
the pride and arrogance of the feudal system,
have been difdaitifully inserted in the lift of Uto
pian opinions, fit only for the dreams of the phi
lanthropist, and not for the practical purposes
of government.âAfter the fuccefsful experience
of America, it was dill difficult to copy the ex
ample and introduce dniong the degenerated nati
ons of Europe, this invaluable discovery of the
new world ; it required the enlightened energy
and unremitting efforts of a numerous people,
to support a doclrine which was combated by
such powerful enemies, and opposed by such in
veterate prejudices. But at length the revoluti
on is effected, and already do the rights of man,

A few needy individuals in trade, are not equal
to discharge the burden, and if the monied men
