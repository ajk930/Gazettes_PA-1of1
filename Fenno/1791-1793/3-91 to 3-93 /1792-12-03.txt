WE iearn by letters From Semlin,
dated the 4th inlt, that the
Turkish inhabitants of Belgrade, who
had withdrawn from ibence during
the war, after having afieuibled to
the number of 2000 men near Se
mendiia, and provided themfielves
in their route with cannon, on the
gilloflart: month marched under
the command ofCarra HafTan before
Belgrade, where they fummaned the
Pacha to grant them a free entrance
into the city, and to re- establish them
in their former polfeffions. Their
demand having been refufed, they
prepared to obtain it by force. On
the morning of the 3d of this month
they aflaulted the city, and obliged
the Pacha to retire with his garrison
iiwÂ» citadel, which, at the de-
parture of the courier, was menac
ed by the rebels.

The two daughters of the heredi
laryPrince ofÃaden-Durlach,Loui fa-
Maria, aged 1 3 years and a half, and
Frederica-Dorothea, aged 1 r years
and a half, palled through this city
011 their way to Petersburg ; we are
allured that these two princeiTes are
dellined as consorts for the two el
dest (ons of the grand duke of Ruf

PARIS, September
The coinmilfioners appointed to
fttparintejid tha Royal PriJ'ouets ill
the Temple, have informed the
Council General of the Com-mons,
that three or four hundred people
ti'oinetiines assemble in the night,
iliear the tower where the king lodg
es,-and calling out fometiines Vive
It Roi. Meafuree have been taken
.by the Council to prevent such af
-femblages in future j and tliev have
proposed to take frotn the king his
red ribband and other insignia of
royalty, as feudality which iliey
fay ought not to be fuffered.
The Cominonsof Paris sent to the
Convention an inventory of the sil
ver plate found in the lioufes of the
brothers of die King.
Carobonââ¢â¢ I mole that all the
filler plate found in the different
churches, and in the houses of the
emigrants, be immediately sent to
the mint.".â Decreed.
The Commons of Paris wrote to
tile Convention, that the three mil
lions afligned to them fo r the pur-
J)ofe of liquidating notes iflued by
the Bank of Aids, were expended,
f hey therefore requefled two mil
lions more, that they might be ena
bled to liquidate the whole of these
Dotes.
This occasioned a long debate, in
which la Croix and Cambon com
plained that the Commons of Paris
demanded new funds, without (hew
ing to what purpose they had appli
ed the former grant.
Ihe President quitted the Chair,
tojultify the Commons, and said,
tl\at when their accounts fhoold be
'"IpetSed, no caule of blame would
be tound againit them.
Ln Croix and Chauibon moved,
''that the department ofParis fliould,
in three days, give in an account of
the purposes to which they had ap
plied the three millions formerly
granted ; and also a particular ac
count of the present Itate of the pri
vate Banks of Paris which have il
fued noiesâDecreed.
The Conuniffkijiers of the Execu
tive Power wrote from Lille, dated
September stating, that the
jtlace was regularly besieged ; that
Wednesday, D :zmber 5, 175)2.
:tu- cccmy wrrf in force, and the
garrison very weak, but that ths
courage of the soldiers and citizen;
gave ihem reaCon to hope that the
enemy would be repnlfed.
A deputy of the Department of
the North declared, that the coiti
miffioners were mifinfornied ; for
lie knew beyond a doubt, that the
garrison confided of s,sooinfantry,
and 600 cavalry.âThere was no
evening fitting this thry.
The position of the armies is
still the fame, anil the Pruliians are
in as much diltrefs as ever. It is
well known that there have been
private conferences between the
Dukeof Brunfwiek, Lucchrfini, and
some Frencfy olficers : and it is sup
posed these conferences are intend
ed to bring about fame accommoda
tion between the contending Pow-
ei s."
General Kcllerman'i Cmnp, Sept. 25.
" Since the affair of t lie 20th, no
thing has palled between the two
armies. They are always in fight
of each other. That of the enemy
has advanced upon our left ; by
which means they occupy the two
routes of Chalons and Rheiuis, and
have blocked up both these conimu
i)ications. They ravage all the
neighbouring villages, but they will
all loon die of hunger, for the pea
l'ants have carried ofFall their cattle.
" At present there is a verbal sus
pension of hoftilitjes. SomePruflian
officers have been to dine wiih Ge
nerals Kelieiman and Ounumiier.â
M. Heyman, an emigrant officer, at
present a Major General in the ser
vice of Pruflia, wai among the num
ber. 'There have been foine private
conferences, bat they have produc
ed nothing. The proposals present
ed by the Prussians are, that the
King fliould be re-eftabliihed. You
need not doubt how these were re-
ceived
" Yesterday the King of Prussia's

" A conference was just going to
be held, when intelligence arrived
that Royalty had been abolished in
France by a decree of the National

It has been said, that one miniller

persisted in his expulsion.
Chabot's motions were resumed,
and another very warm debate took
place, and again Perion, and his
friends who wereprefent, procured
the adjournment, without trying
their strength in bringing the in
flammatory quertions to vote.
NATIONAL CONVENTION
September 30.
Citizens Robert, Mayor ofVancq,
and Benier, Re<ftor of that Commu
nity, being admitted to the bar, ad
dressed the Convention as follows :
" Representatives of the French
people ; we here addrefsyou in the
name of seven or eight hundred ci
tizens, to Whom nothing remains
but the alhes of their habitations,
and their fidelity to the republic,
and who, for their attachment to
* the laws, have experienced the ven
geance of the enemies of liberty.
" On Monday, the 24th of this
month, the Municipality ofVancq,
in the diftric't of Vouzieres, and de
partment of Ardennes, received an
order in the name of the ci-devant
Marshal tie Broglio, coiuinandiiig a
body of Emigrants, whose head quar
ters were then at Vouzieies, tofup
ply his army with provisions. The
Municipal Officers faithful to their
duty refufed to comply. In the
course of the day a second summons
was sent, with threats of military
execution, and setting fire to the
place in cafe of refufal, but the Mu
nicipality (till returned their for-
mer answer.
" In a moment the flames consum
ed our whole crop both of wheac
Ariel barley, with our barns, stables,
horses, and nearly 200 houses which
were about a third of the whole
number in the place
of the Mayor, that of his brother,
a deputy ofibe national convention,
and the church were also destroyed.
" Their rage was not yet Hirisfied
they maflacred wi-.hout diltinÂ«fti
on, Â«W men, women, and children
"râ'(hey prevented a mother from en-
tering her house cof.i\e her thiee
children,who perished in ihe flames.
They offered a pardon to anv
pei foil who would deliver up , f." c
Mayor and the Rector, but luckily
we found means to lave Â«iurfei*c<,
by routs luikuovvfi to the wonftcfts
who are thus ravaging our countiy,
" The emigrants faiiated wiih
carnage, and covered wit h the blood
of their fellow citizens, at length
retired ; but they tied to the tairt
of their horfen some of the inhabi
tants, whom tltey carried off with
them to ferye as a trophy of their
infamous triumph.
" We requelt an aid of 50,000 li
vres, to relieve the urgent wains of
our community, as rhe loss we have
fullained is ettimated at mere than
500,000 livres."
On a motion made by M. Lacroix,
the convention :leceÂ«J, " t hat t!:t
above sum fiiould be aifigned to the
Minister of the Home Department
to relieve the village of V'ancq, and
that it should be taken from the
money produced by the sale of ef
fects belonging to the Emigrants."
A number of members, amonp
whom were Cambon, Manuel, ami
Collot d'Herbois, moved " that all
the effects of Broglio should be im
mediately fold." The lull member
moved, "that the punishment of
death Ihould be inflicted on every
Frenchman who fcou)d quit his
country, 10 go and inhabit any
country now at war with France."
A number of other propofitiors were
also made, but afer a little discus
sion, they were all of them referred
to a committee.
ACCS'SATIO NS Itt. THE HiClO'i.l
On Tuesday, on a proposal made
by M. Merlin for alloting a guard
to the National Convention fiorn
lie eighty-Flnee departments, a
long debate arose, of which we (hall
only endeavor to give a gtner*l
idea.
M. Merlin said, that a dictatorial
party had been denounced to him
in the Aflipmbly ; he demanded to
have this party pointed out, that he
might poignard the firft man who
should arrogate to himfelf the pow
er of a dictator.
M. Lafource made a very able re
ply. He had not fpaken of a dic
tator, or a dictatorship ; but he hatd
alluded to a dictatorial power, which
some men of intrigue and ambition
might aim at. At the conclusion of
his speech he referred to the au
thors of the late dif6rders, and one
or two members mentioned M. R6-
bercfpierre.
M. Oflelin denounced M. Robert
fpierre. He accused him of being
connedled with several other mem
bers of the department ?.f Paris,in,a
league for eretfing a tribunitial pow
er, that was to role and govern the
republic under the name of n Jri
umvirat: or diHature. ** -
M. Barbareux, a deputy forMar
feilles, affirmed, that one 01 Robert
fpierre's si tends (M. Pains) had
pointed him out to the Marfeilloi*
as a proper, and indeed the only
person to fill, or at least to head the
diftatorfhip ; but they had all ex
claimed, " That ha-.ing never bow
ed their necks beneath the tyranny
of a king, they would not acknow.
ledge the despotism of a public ma
gistrate."
M. Robertfpierre recalled
memory of his public fei vices, at a
man of letters, and a uieinber of
the conftituenr aflembly. He dis
avowed every idea of personal am
bition ; and at length formally, but
rather equivocally, denied tl hÂ»
charge.
The house
[Whole No. 576'.]
CONVENTIONSeveral members called tapoiyhim to speak
plainly, and M. Lecointre Pyraveau i a id,
4 Robertfpierre, do not tell us what you did
in the comtitueut alTemblv, but fay plainly,
whether you have aspired to a deflatorfhip, or
a triumvirate !"
In anofher part of his speech, three mem
ber-, M. M. Cambon, Babey, and Lalle, re
peated tie lame demand. M. Robertfpierre
continued hji equivocal defence to a great
length.
Marat was also accused of writings tend
ing to excite the people to aflaflination. It
was with difficulty that he was permitted to
speak ; and when he observed, 44 that he had
many personal enemies in the convention,"
the whole body role up amidst (houts of dis
approbation, and declared their hatred to him.
Being at length permitted to proceed, he
spoke of his attachment to cause of liberty ;
his comtant and open enmity to a corrupt
court; his long iinprifonmeut; and, above
all, his predictions relative to La Fayette,
whole treason he had anticipated, and whose
guilty Juccefs lie had been lucky enough to
prevent.
M. Boileau, who futceeded him in the tri
bune, pulled out one of the afliches, or adver
tifeinents, circulated by him, in which he
told the people, 44 that if in the eight firft
feiiions of the convention, the basis of the
was not laid and adjusted,
a new infant;<Jtion, and a subsequent di&a*
ture would be absolutely neceiTary."
There is no manner of doubt hut the af
feinbly would have launched a decreeof accu
farion against him, if he had not declared his
repentance in regard to this proceeding, and
produced a journal polterior to the date of
tiie above, in which he evinced more modera
tion, and recommended far different princi
ples to the people.
In the course of his defence Marat said,
lt If you enquire concerning my heart, I can
answer with t(udi that it is pure, but as to
my thoughts, tney are my own ; no power
under Heaven has a right, to demand an ac
count of them. I declare, that if the decree
is carried against me, 1 lhall here biow my
brains out." âThe fight of the weapon, and
of the exprellive gestures of M. Marat, agi
tated the convention considerably, and a loug
debate followed, until the call for the order
us the day.
Mar Dial Luekner sent a letter to the con
vention, j ullifying himlelf from the asper
sions thrown out againlt him in the fitting of
the 27th ult. to the charge made against him
of having left the incendiary Jarry unpunifti
ed, he replied, that the court martial of the
army of'the north Was not organized ; that
there was neither a coinmiflai y of stores, nor
a commiiTary of accounts ; and that he had
requested the itiinifter at war, but in vain, to
appoint such officers.
" When 1 let out for the Belgian Nether
lands," added he, " I was alfured that I
should be joined by 30 or 43,030 men ; but 1
remained there 14 days without feeing one of
them. I however continued at Courtray,
from which 1 wrote to the minister, entreat
ing him to fend me a reinforcement, that 1
might either maintain my post, or March
against Ghent, which 1 could not do without
more troops, because the enemy, who were
on my flank at Tournay, would infallibly have
cut off my retreat."
He concluded by observing, that his papers
were among his baggage, which would arrive
next week, and t: at he would then lay before
tbe commissioners the different letters he had
received from the ministers.
DIPLOMATIC AFFAIRS,
The following is a copy of the memorial de
livered in last nigluby the miuifterof foreign
affairs, concerning the situation of the prin
cipal European Powers, as far as refpcCts
trance.
RuJjUâ" It has been announced, that a
Ruflian fleet is to piri's the Dardanelles, and
enter the Mediterranean ; but this fleet is
not as yet equipped.
4t It has a]lo been told us, that 20,000
Ruffians have left Poland, and are now on
their march tosVa vd \ out frontiers ; but
22,033 more are still wanting, hi order to
subjugate that country.
Denmarkâ" I-> too poor and too wife not
to remain neutral.
Sxu.denâ" His been enlightened by a great
doineitic example, which has evinced the
dangers with w.iich despots and ufuipers are
conltantly surrounded; and its Regent polfeffes
too many virtues, not to re!peÂ£t a people de
termined to the laws only, which are Co
many written virtues.
md Aujtnu.â" At Berlin, the greut
elt fermentation reigns among the people of
a king who wiflus to attack our rights. They
adore that liberty which he blasphemes and
combats, but cannot overturn.
The I'uairn oj BrandrniurgâAuftria, which
can never be united but by means of criminal
passions, are nearly divided by those very
passions; and the King of Pruflia is actually
defirou , of making peace with France.
ou t to declare war against
us; lhe wants money, notwithfhinding her
mines ; and men, notwithstanding her pof
ieilions in the two worlds.
Gr eJ t.J),,ia, n .-*"ln England the king detests
us, but the people efteein us; and although
the constitution permits the king ta declare
war he dare not do it without the consent of
ins luojeCts.
Smucrbnd.â" Thcle brave mountaineers

plat they (h.>uld liare Â».> French Princes in a
republic, and tjat tl.c nation paid an annuity
of three millions, as the appanage oJ the gen
tlemen.
44 The National Convention no onger ac
knowledging French Princes, fuppnfl.es their
salaries of appanage."
M. Leonard Bourbon observed, that the
Lsgiilative Alfembly had fixed the salary of
tjhe ci-devant King at five hundred thousand
livres, he obierved that no prifonerhad ever
such a salary ; and therefore propo/ed that it
be fuppreired, and tne Municipality of Paris
charged to supply the wants of the prisoners.
After a few observations from M. Tallier,
it was referred to the Committee ot Fi.iqce,
and the Convention rose at five o'clock.
Paris, Sept. 29.
44 The two leading factions jfl-rm ai.mi 4
which (hall be the firft to betray ach e'er,
by delivering up the King and Roy. 1 Family
to the Duke of Brunfwick, should tl vbe able
to eleape being maiTacred in this conflict of
super-eminent wickedness and treachery.
<4 The Chiefs of the Jacobin faction in Pa
ris are perfectly well allured among them
selves, that their armies cannot face the
Duke of Brunfwick. They therefore mean
to put the best face on a bad cause, in order
to prcferve a little popularity with the peo
ple at large, and retire with an army, such as
it is, composed of the' hordes of banditti who
are very numerous, to Bourdeaux, fVom
whence it will be an easy matter for the
chiefs to embark for some part of America.
Most of the leading men of the fa&ion have
plenty of money, for they have been pillaging
the public coffers for the last two years, par
ticularly Duinourier. Condorcet's wife is
already gone off with the most valuable of her
husband's etfe&s, and he always carries his
own paflport about about him, that he may
be able to escape on the firft moment of dan
ger. Bourdeaux is evidently their place of
refuge. Whether in the event of the king's
not bÂ«Â°ing delivered up, he is to be forced to
go with seems a matter Undetermined.
But probably he will be taken with fhem.
" 1 have reason to expect, that Gkneral
MOll tefquiou,who commands tTieFr'encl forc
es in the South, has made an irruption into
Savoy for no other purpofc than to capitulate
with the enemy.
" The city of Lyons is particularly favor
able to the aristocratic party, and the Sardi
nian trnops will be welcomed whenever they
come there with great joy by the inhabitants
at large, if we except about joo of the ban
ditti, who compose the Jacobin Club of that
city. The Sardinian troops would have been
there already, had 10,000 of the Auftrisns
from Milan joined themfooner.
" Although the King of Spain has not feem
cd much disposed to interfere, yet he proba
bly will now,the fame as the Swiss have done,
rhe latter would have declared war long
since, had not many of their regiments been
divided in several parts of France, which
made them apprehensive of their troops fall
ing-victims to such a proceeding.
" The troubles in the Department of Fi
nifterre are not yet terminated. Foartien
parishes have revolted, refufing to pay the
taxes, under the pretext that without a King
there can be 110 nation, and consequently nei
ther government nor authority capable of ex
acting contributions from the people. The
volunteers, provided with artillery, have
marched to crush this rebellion, but it is tho't
this expedition will not terminate so fuccefT
tully as the former one. The unfortunate
peasants have been condemned to pay 2j,000
livres to defray the expenses of the patriots,
incurred at the time of the firft infurreftion.
" It is generally known, that there is some
very bad news in town from our armies, but
what it is, I have not been able to learn.
Every thing that turns out unfortunate is so
cautiously concealed, that we know very lit
tle of what goes forward till two or three
days after the news arrives, and then" it is
pre r ented in so mangled a (late, that it is dif
ficult to discover the truth."
" P. S. We havejuft learnt the news of
Chalons and Rheims being taken by the com
bined armie*. This news niuft have been
known by some for many dayÂ» pad, but all
the Gazettes are silent on the fubjeft."
It appears that the Canton of Berne is dis
posed to give up the paPs of Portentrui to the
Emperor, and to a<st hoftilely against France.

Priests.
The chief subscription amounted, onThurf
day, to four thoufaud pounds.
About four hundred and twenty persons
have at present applied for relief. The Pa
lace at Winchester, which, in the last war,
held 1,100 FrÂ«nch and Dutch prisoners, is
now preparing for their reception, and a
thousand may probably be accommodated
there, in such a manner as to fhfew that our
cb irity is nbt iniuitiiigly given. But the no
tion that the place is a lort of prifori has, we
ui. .erftand, prevented great numbers from
applying for admiflion to it.
A contractor furnifhes beds, during a cer
tain term, for 20001. : each person adopted
oy the charity,is to have two guineas a month
for the purchase of food ; and the greater part
will receive betides, twenty (hillings, the fir ft
month, as an allowance for clothes.
The great saloon in the Palace will be en
tirely filled with beds.
In the mean time,fubfcriptions are proceed

humanity, all political confidei ations are hap
pily excluded from it.
Should M. Dumouiier have Sfted, as is re

can fay of him, is that he was a good kernel

M. de Calonne reached Dover on Sunday,

M. Duma-., a member of the late national
aflembly in France, is arrived in London.
He is among those who voted for M. de la
Fayette, and of tourfe it was not fafe for him
to relide any longer in Paris.
It appears by Utters from Fribourg, in
Germany, that the Viscount Mirabeau, who
arrived at Oflemboutg on the 15th ult. at Jjrft
refufed every kind of remedy, dreading that
he should bo poisoned. At length he resigned
bimfelf into the hands of his physicians,' and
became better. In a violentdifpute with one
of his officers, he fell into an apoplexy, of
which he died, much regretted by the mili
tary under bis command.
The erouils of foreigners who land,and tra

Of the aftonilhiug increase of business in
the bank of England, the bcft idea may be
formed from considering the. increase of its
servants. Between 40 and 50 years ago there
were scarcely more than that number of
Clerks in employ there; this is still in the re
eolleftion of a few of the oldeit servants of
the bank ; at present the number employed
amounts to more than 400.
It has been averted that some merchants
have advanced l'ums to a considerable amount
to the King of France, (153 millions) nothing
can be more falfe. Had this been fact, their
houses would have been plundered, and their
lives forfeited to the summary vengeance of
the many-headed monster, the mob. They
have denied the charge, and it has not been
supported.
The Canton of Berne, in Switzerland, has

Tumult at Toulon.
The following is a letter from Toulon, dated
September 12.
" A plan of a counter Revolution discover
ed itfelf here fifteen daysfince. Unfortunate
persons confined in prison, forced, with sa
bres in their hands, the gaolers; and. those
malefactors, who were in number 1536 per
sons, spread themselves in bands over the
city, and gave rife to well founded fears. The
council general of the community allembled
immediately, ordered the gates of the town
to be (hut, the generate to beat, and seized
the galley prisoners, who, upon interrogation,
answered, that arms, and the means of ensur
ing their liberty, had been promised them.
u The authors of this movement were also
arrested and iniprifoned. They were inter
rogated, and declared guilty of confpiracv ;
yefterdav they were hanged. M. Flotte, com
mandant of marine, and M. Rochmaure, cap
tain of a vefTel, met with the fame fate.
There are flill in the prisons many officers,
accused of having refufed to take anns on the
day of the tumult."
The following decree, proposed by M. Du
mas, in the National AlTembl v was adopted
in the following words :
The National AiTembly confidently the ne
cetuty of providing as fpeedilv as possible, for
an exchange of prisoners of war, and fjr re

combat ng for their country, mjÂ»y have fallen
into the hands of the enemy. Considering al
io, that the basis upon which the Executive
power, or the generals of armies, may con

i. There ftiall be no pecuniary tarif for the

but in terms relative to the corresponding.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday y November 23.
In committee of the whole.
A bill for regulating foreign coins uÂ».
aer conlideration, which enacts that the
gold coins of Great-Britain and Portugal
(hall be a legal tender for payment of all
debts, at the rate of one dollar for everv
twenty-seven grains of the actual weight
thereof, and the gold coins of France and
Spain at the rate of one dollar for eveiy
twenty-seven and two-fifths of a grain of
the weight thereof.
Mr. Page said, he wished to be inform
ed whether there really was the difference
between the French and British coins
rtated in the billâif so, how that differ,
ence had been ascertained 'That a few
years since he had examined hydroftati
cally the different gold coins named in the
bill, and a variety of coins of the German
empire ; and that although he readily dis
covered that the fpecific gravity of the
latter was so little as to juftify the low va
lue at which they were generally rated
he remembered well, that there was by no
means such difference between the fpeci
fic gravity of the former as could juflify
the discrimination made in the bill. He
added, that he doubted whether, iftheie
leally rtiould appear to be that difference
between the coins, it would be proper ta
introduce the diftin&ion by a law of the
general government, as it might be at
tended with some inconvcniencits, and
might be construed into a partiality to
Bi itifh commerceâhe theiefore, to take
the lenfe of the committee, moved to
amend the claule, so as that the goldcoitu
of Great-Britain, Fiance, Spain, and Por
tugal (hould be payable at the fame rates.
Mr. Tucker seconded Mr. Page, and
supported hrs motion with fitnilar argu
ments.
Mr. Fitzfimons said he should vote a
ainft the amendment,becaufe, he believed
that the diftin&ion proposed in the bill
was really that which did exist in the in
trinlic value of the coins alluded to.
Several other members opposed the
motion, because, said they, we have no
doubt that the Senate, who originated the
bill, had conlidered the fubjeft fully, and
had made the proper ellimate (on full ir
foi mation) of the real value of the differ-
ent coins.
Mr. Page replied, that since he had on
ly heard the opinions and suppositions of
gentlemen opposed to his opinion, and no
latisfadlory proof offered to fnpport the
bill againlt his amendment, he (liould per
sist in his motion ; for, said he, although
I will not be so dogmatical as to assert
that 1 am right, and the Senate wrong ââ¢
yet, in a matter of this nature, which ad
mits of politive proof and\demonfttatiou,
and which, as far as my own a&ual expe
riments have gone, eftablilh my opinion,
I cannot give it up, till I have been con
vinced by other arguments than such as I
have heard. Had 1 been told that the
different coins alluded to had been exa
mined hydroftaticaDy, or had been alTay
ed by proper persons appointed for that
putpofe, I (liould have acquicfced. I
might poflibly however have supposed that
they were of a different coinage or emis
sion from those which I had examined.
I think the clause under confideiation is
of such importance as to require full and
fatijfadtory proof to the world, that it has
not been adopted without a thorough w
veltigation of the truth and propriety v'
the diferimination it establishes between
the coins of the nations with which we
have such a conTiderable commercial m
tercourfe; with that proof, I Ihoiild be fa
tisikd, and would defy the invidious lu>-picioÃ of our being influenced by impro
per motives; but til! such proof be affor
ded, I mult think it would be better to a
roend the bid as I proposed, which would
leave those coins on their prefetit footing
duiitig only the (horfterm to which their
circulation is limited by the bill.
Â£ro.n what fell from feme gentlemen,
he laid, it appeared that they thought the
examination of the relative value of coins
could only be ascertained by an alfayer.â
He affirmed that any person acquainted
with the use of an hydrostatic balance
might easily examine them:âThat it was
with reludtance he said any thing which
might look like a fcientific parade, but he
thought it his duty to bring forward the
inquiry he made; and what had fallen
'fraiÃ some gentlemen compelled him to
explain and lupport his motion.
To explain what he had said refpÂ«Â£ting
the hydrostatic experiment, he observed,
that it had pleased nature, or rather the
great author of nature, to annex to moll
bodies, and particularly to metals, a dif
ferent weight: Happily each species of
substances have different weights, which,
with propriety are called their fpecific
gravities : That most happily for our pur
pofe,acubic foot of water weighs lOOOozs.
avoirdupois ; and a body when immersed
in water, displaces a mass of water equal
to the bulk of the immersed body, in dis
placing which mass of water, the body, if
suspended to a pair of scales, is found to
lose a weight exadtly equal to the weight
of the mass of water so displaced ; ib,
that if any piece of money be weighed
firft in air, and then in water, its lol's of
weight in water will be exattly the weight
of an equal bulk of water, whicli mud at
once give the comparative weight of that
piece of money and of water. And as
by this method pine gold has been found
to be about nineteen times heavier than
water, and copper nine timesâwhich has
beengenerally th&alloy used in gold coins,
if copper be mixed iu any propoition (or
any other metal whose fpecific gravity is
known) the fpecific gravity of the com
pound may be found, and the exact pro
portion of each ingredient ascertained ;
and here I will remark, that as in the ast
eftablifning a mint, arid regulating the
coins of the United States, the proportion
offilver and copper, which are declared to
be the composition of the alloy for our
gold coins, ia not e.%aA!y fixed ; t h erc
muit be a difficulty of finding the real va
lue of that coin without an a&ual and ac
curate allay, and also room for varying its
value. But as this is happily left to" the
uiferetion of the director of the mint,
whose abilities, accuracy and integrity ate
lo remarkable, no inconvenience need be
appiehended, as there is no doubt that he
will observe the trust reposed in him,
a;iu that he will point out, from time to
time, the exact proportion of these two
ingredients of the alloy, which are left by
bill t0 h,s discretion. This I looked
Â»<pon as a defect in the bill, and mention
ed when it was before us the lalt session,
as a reason why I wi/lied to have it recom
mittedâbut to return to the question.â
As 1 have found that the fpecific
Â® t e gold coins of England, France,
Spam and Poitugal was, as well as I can
Â«ow remember, about seventeen and an
a > and that of some German coins not
teen that is, that the former weighed
entecn and an h a ]f [J mes more t] lan an
equal mass of water, and the latter not fif
Â«'.i times as much, or in other words,
lat a cubic foot of the former, weighed
7.J00 oz. whilst a cubic foot of the lat
er wouM not weigh 15,000. I f ay as I
f* e tound thl6 be the cafe, I wish to
know now whether any later experiments
10 0 coins have been made to p/ove
tthe ';eisthe difference stated in the
.1 there have been such experiments
h llwnhdraw my motion, if not, I must
"lutt upon it.

f C Mr.W. Smith, Mr. Lawrance,
and Mr. Hilihoufe, supported the motion. It
was said that the law was found inadequate to
the purpose for which it was made; that while
m some cases it was not carried into executi
on, in others very improper grants of pen
nons had been made. Information was wanted;
this information may be obtained; the law is de
fe&ive, and ought to be revised. Justice, there

tions, and to make that provision which the fi
nances of the country are competent toâimpose
a necc-i: ty that the motion lhould be adopted. In
reply to the objection, that information would
ceme in of eourfe, from the War Office, it was
said, the motion wtnt to several points, on which
it was not the duty of the Secretary to report, .
unless he was required to do it.
