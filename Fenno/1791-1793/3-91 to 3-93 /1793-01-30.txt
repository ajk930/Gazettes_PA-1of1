IT would be improper for the publisHer to
mention any thing refpetling the literary ta
lents ot an author, so generally known and
clteemed. Nor does it appear nereflary 10 re
queit attention to peruse a work, whofc import
ance is universally acknowledged. Those who
have rpad the ancient systems and these volumes,
will readily perceive, that the knowledge of
philosophy, advances from a state of infancy,
towards maturity ; nor will it appear tpf* much,
-when it is said, that Dr. Reid has diveftd moral
science 'rom that veil undcÂ»- which forjp many

(Mr. Bovdinot's Speech couclhtUJ.)
J- -jiij IL: â¢ â¢ - - -
Mr.Boud:notal!cdgcd his privity to t.'iii bufi
ness, having been in Congress at the time, and o
course one of the parties to the contrail. He alf'
observed very particularly on this measure, ori
ginating with the army, and especially the ne
gotiable property of the certificates: that in tin:
tranfaition all former demands were involved
and the express flipulaticn of the army, and the
assent of Congress was, not to pay a fpecific sum
in Ipecie ; but to givefuch securities for tie bsi
lances as JboM ie given tu the other creditor! of the
United States. Here then Was no difference b*
tween creditors, all were put on a footing, and
every citizen who had made advances for the go
vernrnent, or had fought her battles, were coÂ»(>
dcrsd equally entitled to the attention of govern
ment. .from .tfcis tjg;Â«. the.a.--
luy put on the face oT a'jetied debt, ant, rettii
litions were made to the different States for a
fund, on which to found a certainty of payment
at least of the interest from year to year; all the
States but one having made the ar
rangements, the plan was fruftrated, but many
of the individual states made provision for, and
did actually pay the interest of 6 per cent. forXc
veral yearsânotwithstanding these partial pay
ments, the public credit fuffrcd much, and a
mong other causes, the great number of these
negotiable securities brought tp market, was not
.the leal}. The distresses of some, the differer.ti.
objeil of pursuits of others which required capi
tals ; the debts of others which called for pay
ment as soon aÂ» the war was over, and the lears
of others for the fate of the government, all con
fpircd to bring on a general bankruptcy. These
securities fell from 6s Bd. to 2s. 6d. in the pound,
and transfers were as common as any other mer
chandize. The public fears and the uuiverlai
complaint of creditors finally brought about a
change of the government, and the new consti
tution was formed ; in which two material arti
cles applied, to creditorsâ<me thy new
government was to be liable for tiie debts of the
old; âand another, that all contrails lhould be
carried into effeit agreeably totheterms-of them.
The old Congress had so far complied with their
engagementsas to give the securities required by
the contrail, and to apply to the individual
states for the funds promised The new govern
ment at the earned request of hercreditors, turn
ed an early attention to the public debt. She
found the contrails were with the original cre
ditor. bearer, or aflignee. The Jiolder was equal
ly a party to the contrail, and demanded the
whole debt, without regard to the sum paid for
it to the original holder ; on the other hand ma
ny contended for the right of the firft creditor
as an equitable demand to the surplus (or at leail
a part of it) after paying the principal and in
terest of the sum for which it was transferred.
To this it was answered, that Congress could
not conftder themselves as a court of law or e
quity to determine these claims. They were
bound to A. B. or bearer, or his aflignee. The
holder of the evidence of the public debt, could
alone, in law or equity give a dilcharge of the
debt. That it wouki be unconftitutionai to des
troy the contrail of the parties, when made bor,a
jdc, and it was agreed that fraud could vitiate e
very contrail, for which the courts of juflice
were adequateâtherelore it was, that all discri
mination was refufed, firft as a matter without
the jurifdiilion of Congress; iecoDdly,asa mat
ter unjust on the principle of a fair contrail,
made on a risque to be run ; and lastly, as im
prailicable in its very nature. In conlequence
of this, propositions were made to the holders
of the public securities, on the principles of the
funding system ; the fubllance of which were,
that as the government in its infancy could not
embrace a discharge of the debts, or indeed a
payment of full interest, with jut rifqueing the
pnblic credit as heretofore, and by this means a
gain exposing the creditor to loss; it was there
fore advileablc to new modify the debt, so that
the creditor fliould give up 3 per cent. upon the
interest, and 1 per cent, on the principal for 10
years, for which he lhould receive an equivalent
in the following manner :âlt was a very reason
able conjeilure, in cafe the new government
succeeded, and public credit was restored, that
interest would fall in J years to 5 per cent, and
in 10 years to 4 per ceut.âin which call Con
gress might, by new loans, at that rote of inter
est, pay off the whole national debt; but 011 the
prcfent plan, (he would fccure to the holder full
4 per cent, on the principal for 10 years, and af
terwards 6 per cent, for a certain number of
years on terms, with 3 per tent, on the interest
let the common rate of interest be what it might.
This was accepted by the creditor as a realisa
ble equivalent, and the debt wasfubfcribed.
The event proved the truth of thefuppefition,
and the value of the funded debt at one tirre
rose to ijs. on tile pound on 6 per cent, while
leant have treen made by the United States, at
irom 4 to j per ccat. Congress thÂ«yi Â»certainty 6 per tent. for a munber Â©f years,
on the termi of the loans for a partial reduction
for 10 years,and alefs interest on the arrears of
interest then due. This was certainly a full and
generous equivalent, and the only advantage
gained by the public, was a modification of the
debt, by which the burthen would be divided,
and the increafcd number of citizens during 14
or 15 year*-, would bear their proportion of the
cxpence of a war, in the benefit of which they
so effpntially participated. At the time of fund
ing the public debt the irredeemable quality was
confidcred as a full equivalent, and a compliance
with the public faith. Mr. B alledgcd that he
was then a public creditor, and confidcred it in
that point of liglvt. He was a creditor that had
a fight to feel a loss as mud? as any man.âHe
creditor of 177 ft, when the army could
notoe lent to Canada without hard money.â
He was a creditor in 1777> when the prisoners
were perishing for want of food and cloathing,
and the government could not furnifh a iingle
suit, or a tolerable supply for their extreme dif
lrefÂ«.âHe was a creditor of I 77&Â» w hen at the
Valley Forge, the tracks of the ioldiers were
marked with blood for want of shoos, which he
coile&ed in different parts of the Hate by his
own exertions, and at his own expence without
ft cor reward; and was not repaid till 17 79.â
He was a large creditor of 1779, w^ien Cungrefs
lent to all parts of the Union, earnestly calling
on the friends of their country to come forward
with loans for the public exigencies ; and he was
a creditor as an officer of the army, in which lie
had Curved. Under this view of the fubjed Mr.
B. acknowledged that he had entertained great
jealoufies,left foipic other end was aimed at by
the pre fen t resolution, than the ostensible one ;
this was raised when he heard gentlemen found
the success of the resolution pn the tarings made
â¢ by the funding system, when those gentlemen
had for years pall been continually reprcfenting
that system as founded on an extravagant Â« afte
of public trcafurq.,: TKat th* j/redeemability of
the 4ebt was a tax on tne government, which
ought never to have been admitted, as monies
might have been loaned at 4 per cent, and by
that mwans one third of the debt saved to the
union : What ideas then must we form ot a re
solution calculated to raise the hopes of the me
moria lifts, which in the end would certainly turn
out a mere Pnadow and worse than a Ihadow;
this really was trifling with the complaints of
our fellow citizens. There had been 110 favmgs,
the creditors who had poffefllon of the public
contra<fts,had received a full equivalent for their
demand by their own free content, at 20s. in the
pound; where then was room for a demand on
the government for any saving ? If there was a
foundation for a claim, it mntl be against the
poflcflorsof the certificates, but however just it
might be, it was merely illusory to form the re
solution on principles that had no existence.
The loffesfuftained by the line of the army,
were not peculiar to them as creditors of the
United States. All classes of citizens who had
generously advanced their money for the support
of this very army in food, cloathing, arms and
ammunition, as well as (hat of the government
itfelf at home and abroad, had been equal fuffer
ers, without the emolument that the army had
received, in the most distressing times of the
war. The army had been a refuge for many
gentlemen driven from their homes, while other
citizens were obliged to wander for a consider
able time without employ or relief. Ke conti
nued his observation* to other citizens who had
fuffered during the war, and particularly men
tioned the fufferers at Falmouth, Charles-Town,
New-York, Norfolk, York-Town, and South-
Carolina, as those who were of the firft class in
the United States; as also the aged, the widows
and the orphan creditors, who had fuffered with
out receiving any advantage whatever from the
public bounty.
Mr. 13. :hen proceeded to consider the practi
cability of the measure, fuppofmg its equality
and just ice to be fairly established. As the appli
cation was now founded on the savings on each
mans individual certificate, the principle equal
ly reached every public creditor.âSuppose then
A.8.C.8. and E<rece ; oed their certificates toge
ther ; A. fold his at 6/"8 in the pound to raise a
tapiral to purctauc public'lati3s, which at one
time in this city fold at 6d. per acre. B. fold
his certificate at 2/6 in the pound, tofave a wife
and children from starving. C. fold his to raise
a capital to go into the speculating line. D.fold
on one day from necessity, but replaced it the
next day and kept it, till the funding system
took place, and then fold at 20/. in the pound,
while E. having confidence in the governmeut,
and not under a necefiity of felling, funded it un
der the present system. How could a discrimi
nation take placc here, or would it be fair equal
ly to remunerate all these original holders ; but
suppose some had fold at 20f and also had recei
ved all the emoluments of the Pennsylvania line,
where would be the deftributive justice of the
measure now proposed. If you extend this doc
trine to the public at large, it will ap
pear in a strong point of light. It is well known
that the common practice of the government
during the war, was to ifiue certificates in fictiti
ous names, the names of clerks in office, of heads
of departments, or otherperfons, merely to make
them anfvver the purpose of a paper currency :
As they were payable to bearer, the name was
th'#ng;ht to be material. The person do
ing the service or lending his money, received
thele certificates, and was really the original
holder, yet the face of the certificate spoke a
different language. In this cafe a difcriminati
-011 would be impossible, and much the largest
part of the public debt, was contracted in this
way after the war was over. Many debts had
been paid by merchants and others to their fo
reign creditors, and others in certificates at their
nom. i.'l vaiue, and .11 other cases individuals
hf.d failed, and the loss wholly fallen on their
creditor 3.
Mr. Boui'.inot carneftly contended that the cx
pence of a difenmirmtien would exceed the reve
nues of the United States. The nature of tranf
ferable flock, which iÂ» designed to operate ascur
rent monct, furoids the idea ofa difcriniination,
and oil (iU jlic credit must necessarily fail if such
a doolrnie was to prevail ill the finances of the
union. This was a very serious and important
idea, worthy the attention of the applicants, who
certainly were interested in the pnblic weal,
The right, of freemen to dispose of their own
property as they please, was involved in the
question ; for if the government was to make
up every loss ou a transfer, then it ouglit not to

Mr. Boudinot hoped he would not be.under
flood to deny either the services or the fu(Jer
ings of the army; but he alledged the proiuif
ed reVompence was given, which had
ferrtd With all the legal and equitable rig*, t$
the holder who had received from government
the full value, and therefore no further demand
eitb.tr in law or equity remained againll ihe go
vernment. The negotiable quality was apriuci
pie in the securities infilled on by the army, and
which they had exercised as they chose, for dif
ferent purposes, and from different views. He
acknowledged, that the generosity, benevolence,
and humanity of Congress had been addressed :
To this he answered that they were but ftewirds
cf the people's property, tor which they vera
aufwerable. That they were not sent here to
fliow their generosity; it wa9 to do jtiflice, and
that not to one clafa, but to every description of
citizens. He knew of but one rule for every
citizen of the U. States. They were all equally
represented in that houfcâbut at all events it
bccamethem tobejuft beforethey weregenerous.
Mr. B. allured the house that he had taken up
so much of their time, fcecaufe he found that 119
one had come forward fairly to meet the quefti
on,and he had too great a regardfor the njemori
aliltj to wish themtogoaway under,the ideathat
any thing had'oeen refufed to them tvhich ought
in propriety to have been done. At any rate he
had Oindidly aad above board given
of his vote on this important occaflon, which
would be a;;ainfl the question prop'ofed by the
gentleman from Virginia.
The following are the Refoluhons mvved, -and the
fubjiance of the remarks and calculations nade y
h Mr. Giles in the Houje oj Reprefcntdtives on
iVedneJdax lujl.
I now iubmit to the confederation of the
house certain resolutions, which I hold in my
hand; and after leading which, I will p*oceed
10 mention the' rcafons, which have influenced me
in moving them ; the resolutions are as follow :
Resolved, that'the President of the United
States be requested to cause to be laid before this
House, copies of the authorities under which
loans have been negociated, pursuant to the a&s
of the 4th and 12th of August 1790, together
with copies of the authorities dire<Sting the ap
plication of the monies borrowed.
Resolved, That the President of the United
States be requested to cause this House to be fur
niflied with the names of the persons by whom,
and to whom, the refpe&ive payments of the
Frcnch debt have been made in France, pursu
ant to the a6b for that purpose, fpecifpng tne
dates of the refpeftive draughts upon the com
miftioners in Holland, and the dates of thfc re
fpe&ive payments of the debts : A similar state
ment is requested, refpedling the debts to Spain
and Holland.
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury
be dire&ed to lay before the this house, an ac
count, exhibiting half-monthly, the balances be
tween the United States and the bank of the
United States, including the several branch
banks, from the commencement of those insti
tutions to the end of the year 179 a.
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury
be dire&cd to lay before this House an account
of all monies, which may have come into the
finking fund, from the commencement Â©f that
inilitution, to the present time, fpecifying the
particular fund from which they have accrued,
and exhibiting, half yearly, the sums uninvest
ed, and where deposited.
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury
be dire&ed to report to this House the balance
of the unapplied revenues, at the end of the year
1 79*Â» fpecifying whether in money or bonds,
and noting where the money is
he also make report of all unapplied revenues,
which may have been obtained by the several
loans authorifedby law, and where such monies
a re now deposited. r-b
Thcfe resolutions have grown out of thfc em
barraflVnents I have met with, in attempting to
comprehend the report 0$ tnefecretaiy of the
irealuiy, made ;n pursuance; "of an order of this
ho'lie, of the 27th of December 1792, exjjibit r
ing fuudry ilatements refpc&ing foieign loans.
Thtle embarriÂ»ffineÂ»Â»ls have increased in pro
portion to the attention which I have bestowed
on the fubj< ft ; and a number of official papers
to which I have had refeience tot information;
instead of elucidating ft em rathefuo oblcurethe
ei.qu.iy. To obtain neceflary information there
l6>e is the objet* ol tl>cfc resolutions, and no one
con doubt the immediate applicability this
in tor (nation to a bill now lying upon your ta
ble, tor the purpose of reirnbuifjng the loan of
2,000,000 of Uollais made ol the Bank of the
Lniied States, by opening a new loan for that
sum abroad, and by changing the application of
the like ium already borrowed and appropri
atcd to the difcliarge of the debt to France from
its original defoliation, to the iiifÂ»
charge of the<ieht to the B<\nk.
The hti\ resolution has anfen from that pait
of the printed report of thcfccrctary of liic trea
sury, which exhibits the terms upon which va
rious loans have been made abroad, but neither
pre'ents the pt cafe authorities under which thofc
negocia'.'.ons have been made, nor the precise
amount ol the sums borrowed lor the fparate
and diUmÂ£t objects ol the two aÂ£ls mentioned in
l.he resolution.
Aupihcr reason has more strongly suggested
the propriety of calling !or the information re
quelled by this resolution. The b>ll now upcu
your table which has been before alluded to,
contemplates the whole of the monies borrow
ed abroad and now on hund, as being originally
278
appropriated to thedifshargeof the Trench deht,
and proposes to change the orig.nal dell,nation
of these identical monies and the reason ani<*n
ed for this mea-fure has been the unfctilcd Hate
of affairs in trance.
In the printed report, the Secretary or the
T.eafury,remarks that the fame monies arc ap.
plicalilc to tire finking fund. It appears Hrange
after express and dift'nÂ£l appropriations by
taw, that anv mifunderftunding relative to this
ohirft, rfionl'd cxift, and the information called
lor may poflTMy explain this teeming contradic-
'I'he fccond resolution has anfen from that
pa*t of thr printed report marked B. and which
exhibits the payments made to France, but does
not furnifh the names of the persons engaged in
those negociations; nor docs it present to view
the length of timt those peifous have bicn pÂ»f
fciTed ot the public monies bv stating the dates
of the refpeflive draiijjhis in Holland and the
dates of the afiual application of the monies to
the discharge of the debt, and it is evident that
from the timrsthc loans are refpeflively created,
to the times of the actual application of the mo
nies borrowed, the United States are paying the
usual interest upon the debt intended to be le
deemcd, and the stipulated interest. upon .he mo.
nies borrowed for the redemption.âThis re-
mark is equally applicable to the payments of
other foreran debts with the payments of the
debt to Fiance.
The third resolution has arisen from calcula
tions drawn partly from the iali page of l he
printed report, and from the original Bank
book of the United States, from which it appears
that the balances in Bank in favor of the United
States, were as follows
n Bank Philadelphia, 30th May?)

August 25th, 30th and 31ft,
1 ' in do,
â . . â¢ I 'Z7~O. ~ '
On the Hrfl of June, a loan was negocwited
yith the Bank of the United Slates on the pait
of the United States tor 100,000 dolls, at 5 per
cent, per ann. On the firft of July another loÂ«m
was made upon the fame terms for the like sum.
On the lft of August another loan was made
upon the fame terms for the like sum. On the
lft of September another loan was made upon
the fame terms for i!ie like sum. It appears
from the last page of the printed report, that
there had been drawn intoAmcrica from theisth
of December, 1790, to the 27th of January, 1792,
of the monies borrowed abroad, the sum of
2,663,621 florins, 2 stivers, and 6 deniers. If
this sum were unexpended and lodged in the
bank at the times of making tbefe loans (and
Congress have never yet been informed oT any
deficiency of revenue) the United States will of
confluence have paid upon the monies bor
rowed from the Bank of the United States, from
15 to 17 per cent, per nun. to wit, they will have
paid 5 per cent upon the original debt to France,
5 per cent, upon the monies borrowed for its
redemption, exclusive of douceurs and other
charges, and 5 per cent, upon the sum borrowed
of the bank, which may be deemed pact of this
dcpofit made in the bank by the United States.
But even dticarding these inferences, it mult be
admitted that the United States have been pay
ing 5 per cent, upon a loan made of the bank,
when a greater sum than the loan made, has
been at all times depofiled in bank on the pait
of the United States.
It is here to be remaikcd, that a balance of caih
is admitted, by the Treasurer's return, to have
been in his hands 3111 December, 1790, amount
ing to 973 342 dolls. 43 cents, and in July 30th,
1791, the fuin of 582,189 dollars, 54 cents.
I am informed that bills are often drawn in
favour of the bank lor monies in the hands of
the revenue officers in distant parts of the United
Statfs, and that credit is entered in the bank
book upon the receipt of such bills, although the
monies may not a&ually be in bank for some
time after the credit i* entered, and hence jt is
inferred, that the bank book does not conclu
sively (how the real sum in bankânot to men
tion that such bills answer all the purposes of
cafb, and ought theiefore to be credited upon
the receipt of them. It is to be remarked that
theie is a regular and continual influx of monies
into the bank by the operation of chefe bills.â
Â»It ismotvery material Whether a biH lodged in
bank to-day, should be paid to-day, provided
fornethiug like the fame sum (hould be paid in
consequence of a bill lodged in bank one or two
months ago, and the bill of to-dav, should be
paid one or two months hence. The following
flatement will, in some incafure explain this
idea, by exhibiting half-monthly the balances of
public monies in all the banks, about the mid
dle and end of each month; beginning with
May 1792, and ending with December of the
lame year.

The fourth resolution has afifen from that
pan of the printed report whieh remarks that
the rejidue a/ the sum drawn from Holland,
amounting 10 1.668.188 d011.!,s 27
phcabtc ta the pur chafe of the public debt. It is
known that the sum ol 1,374.656 dollars 40
cents, being the furpius of the revenue up to the
endlo; December 1790, was originally appropri
ated to the finking fund ; t | l-t t |, c fur pi us of
other appiopriations have been applied to this
fund, and that the intereil of the debt purchased
has alio been wholly appropriated to its in
crcafc : Xt is also known, that between 11 and
12 hundred thousand dollars, and no mi
the original appropriation, have bem
verted in the purchase of the debt, it i, lh ' \

for granting hall* pay for 7 years to the widows
and orphans of such officers of the army as have
been killed in the service of the United States
since the 3d day of June, 1784, or which may
hercai'ter be killed in the public service.
Mr. Key in the chair.
Mr. Hartley, who brought forward the mo
tion, moved to strike out June 3, 1784, and in
fer: 4th day of March, 1729.
Mr. Livermore said he should be in favor of
the- motion if it went as far back as the year
1775, and comprehended the widows and or
phans of the officers of the army killed within
two years from the commencement of the war.
Mr. Williamfon said he (hould consider it his
duty to move for an amendment to the proposi
tion, in the progress of its discussion, hy insert
ing a clause to provide for the widows and or
phans of the afficers of the militia.
Mr. Wadfworth dated the reasons on which
he supposed provision had not been made for
the widows and orphans of those officers which
were killed during the period alluded to by the
gentleman from New-Hampffiire : one princi
pal one was, that the new government wa* ntÂ»
authorized by the conflitution to create a*v dc
maml* agjrinft the United States ;âthe govern
ment was bound to take up the debts as ftiev
found them. The old government had rot re
cognized the claims of those widows and orphans
alluded to. With refpe& to the present refolto
tion, he was opposed to the amendment; âhe
thought it ought to go back to June 1784, the
commencement of the present Indian war. He
should move for other amendments to the reso
lution, that it ftiould provide not only for those
who may fall by the sword, but for such as die
in the public service. He should also be for ex
tending the provision to the widows and orphans
of the officers of the militia. He conlidered it
as a mofl difgraceful thing to a government not
to make provision for the families of those who
/acrificed their lives in the cause of their coun
try.
The motion for striking out June 3, 1784,
was put and carried. The other part of the mo
tion, to insert 4th day of March, 1789, was not
put, being fuperceded by a motion for the com

PARIS, November i
The Parilians are now all confidence in the
success of the new fyUemâ'-thus writes a po
pular Journal*!# :
" The old French monarchy was a veflM
that leaked at every feau:âat length, to fcom
plete its cataitroplie, it has taken fire and
burnt down to the water's edge, while all
who adhered to the wreck have perished. It
now remains to confrruft a firip, that may re
list every attack of the elements. The poli
tical horizon is cleared of the clouds which
have hitherto darkened it-*âthe fun of liberty
has purified itâconspiracy is annihilated.
In a lhort fpafce of timeâin a monthâwe
lliall have all the materials in readiness re
quisite for the conftruftion of that august mo
nument, which is to replace the Gothic edi
fice of Feudality. A new declaration of
rights should be presented to tiie Convention,
and then let t,hem forget all ther private quar*
rels, and employ themselves solely on the bu
fmefs they went called upo* by their consti
tuents to tranfatfh" With all our hearts
we agree with this writer ; but will fa6l ion
thus expire before the wish oV pntriotifi.i ?
Extra ft Jrom tie Ley den Gazette, to November id>.
I, The sudden change of affairs, with le
tgard to the combined invaders of France, i<
to many a perfect mystery. How is it to be
accounted lor, fay they, that after fnch a fuc
cefsful progress the Duke of Brunlwicjc' sud
denly halted in his career, between St. Matey
houid and Cha/onsâand how was it poflible,
that after such a variety cf movements, no
one of which materially injured his plans, he
fliould all at once abandon the cause he had
undertaken, and make an inglorious retreat,
worse in its conferences to him than the ab
solute loss of a battle? We need no longer
'wonder, however, at this event when we con
lider that the fore ft of Argonne is the Tftci
mcpy/iz of France ; and that their new repub
lic is chiefly indebted to the discernment of
General Kellerman in timely poi&fling tliis
invincible pojft, Thi?, aiuLkivfuftaining with
so nuch firmnefs the cannonade of the aoth of
September, compleatly deranged all the plans
of the Dukfe of Brunfwick.
2. As to the army of the French Emigrants,
it is broken up and difmilled. These wretcl -
ed men have received a letter of litenfe from
Marshal Broglio, bv which they are permitted
to go whereever they fee fit, with an ex
ception, however, to rejorr the main attry at the
earlicfi requisition : a clause that leems to have
been added merely to aggravate defpoit. In
fact, in this permit, neither their names nor
places of abode are mentioned ; but they are
advised to recommend themselves in the belt
manner they can to such powers as (hall be
disposed to receive them. They are, indeed,
real ohjefts of pity, and especially thole a
mong them who quitted their country and
property from disinterested motives. Great
numbers have determined to return into
France at all events; and are daily falling,
for almost nothing, their coaches, horfei, &e.
&c. Such of these mifetable people as are at>
folutely without means, and know not where
to go, ar* to be quartered at Malmedy.
3- The recent events of this campaign have
wholly difappoitited the projected plan ofhold
ing a pacific Congress at Luxembourg; at
least, there is no probability of such an event
taking place this year. The French, in the
career of their success, seem determined to
carry the most unqualified liberty through
Europe, and, extravagant as it m?.y seem,
talk of nothing but exterminating tyrants
from every corner of the civilized world.
4- Much has been said of Spain joining the
belligerent league against France â¢ It is true
they are putting their frontier into a state of
defence, but that is all, and merely meant by
way of precaution, and not of offenfive war
fare. The rejection of royal government in
France has occasioned a prodigious shock in
the minds of the Spaniards, but the prime mi
nister seems fully convinced that war with
France cannot be otherwise than ruinous to
Spain ; there iÂ», therefore, every reason to
think that he will persist in his pacific system,
notwithstanding remonstrances from every
part of the kingdom, urging to a contrary
measure. Add to this, that the.influence of
the clergy ii in a declining way in Spain, who
in any other age than the prei'ent might have
influenced, the crown in the liipport of
potifm.
J. The Englilh seem not to have viewed
wiili a complainant eve the French maritime
expedition to the Mediterranean. Letters
from Antiba mention, that admiral Truguet
has taken a large English (hip going into Nice
with a load ot" Muflcets, and other military
store;. She was conducted to a fafe port.
