HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, February 6.
In commit tee of the whole, on the Fijhery, Bill.
[CONTI N U ED.]
TV/TR. GOODHUE The gentleman last up
-L*-*- (Mr. Williamfon) fays, that an appropria
tion of money being made by the bill now before
its, and the treasury ft an ding pledged for the pay
ment, therefore a diretft bounty is granted. At
ptefenr, we pay in drawbacks about 4JOOO dol
lars ; but we cannot fay, that this sum will be
adequate to the payment of the drawbacks next
year : for if a greater quantity of fifh be taken,
a greater sum of course inuft be allowed : and as
the Aim depends entirely 011 the quantity of fifh,
it is iinpoffible to ascertain beforehand the pre
cise amount ; thereis not however, in the whole
bill any thing of a bounty, except the bare name.
The gentleman allows that weniaj commute the
prefeut drawbacks, and give them to the fiflier
man inltead of the merchant: but it is impoliible
to do this with fafety in any other mode than
that pointed out in the billâShallwe leave ir to
the fifherman, to be determined by his oath .'
This would not be advifeable.'
The plan proposed is a much less exceptionable
one ; it is founded on a calculation, that ji certain
quantity of tonnage is employed in taking a cer
tain quantity of fifli :âon this calculation the al
lowance is apportioned to the tonnage: if gen
tlemen think the allowance too high, let the Ann
be reduced ; but let it not be stigmatised as n
bounty :itis no such thing.âThe word ' Botany '
is an unfortunate expreHion ; and I wish it were
entirely out of the bill.
Mr. Livermore. The bill now under conside
ration lias two important objects in view. The
one is, to give encouragement to our fifhermen,
and by that encouragement, to encrenfe their
numbers : the other is ro govern those fifhermen
by certain laws, by which they will be kept un
der due restraint. Both these objeCls are of
great importance to such persons as choose to
employ their capitals in the fifhery business : and
I believe ir will UO t be disputed that the business
itfelt is of considerable importance to the United
States, insomuch as it affords a certain propor
tion of remittance or exportation to foreign conn
tries j and docs not impoverish the country, but
enriches it by the addition of so much wealth
drawn from the sea.
It is the objeCt of those gentlemen, who favor
the bill, that the fifhermen Ihould have some en
couragement, not given to them at the expense
o. the United' States, but directed to them out of
what was, in the former law, called a drawback
of the duty on fait.
1 lie calculation, as I understand, has been
made as nearly as pofTible, to give that draw
back not to the merchants who export the fifli
but to the fifliermen who take it, in order to en'
creale that description of men, without whofc
a hifancj it is in vain'to expect any benefit from
the fifiieries : forif the merchants,at prefenten
in that branch, poilefled the whole capita}
ot the United States, yet if they cannot get fifli
ernien, they canm t carry on the fhhery . this is
done by a particular class of men, who mufl be
not only expert f'eamen, but also accnitomec! to
taking the fifli and curing it. If these men can
not be had, the capital cannot be employed ;
and those who undertake the business, cannot
carry it on, or reap any profit from it.
Whilst the drawback is payable only to the
merchant who exports the fifli, it is impossible to
convince the fifhermen, that they reap from it
any advantage whatever: or if some of the more
< ifcerning among them do perceive any advan
tage in it, the others who are not so cleai-fitrht
ed cannot difcem it, and are therefore not dis
posed to undertake the business. It is how e v er
of considerable importance to the merchants,
t lat the fifherinan fnould receive a proper en
couragement, even if they were obliged to allow
u a bounty out of their own pocket.

The government of tl, e fiftermen, afier . .
engagement n, this bufmefc is also neArr
be provided for : otherwise f'eauent inft' 7
may occur among that class of men e . an . ces
r ..n-e, ; r F d m :,ztr:rji
(hipping rhemfelves for a foreign voyage! before
the expiration of the fifhing season. I?, the la'
er cafe, the vefTel lies u.elefs on the owner,
hands ; and he, together with the whole expense
of theout-fit, loses all hi, profpeds of E*
gain.
The two objects here mentioned, are fully
provided tor in the bill. Still however it bob'
jevfiedl to â¢â¢âbut what is the objection >â it is .
that the word 'bounty ' is twice.,fed this clause'
â Let us now fee what advantage will r e sâ| t f lou
linking out this obnoxious ' bounty.' None ac
all : the bill fays it (hall cease ; and have gen
tleinen any objection to the bounty's ceafine >â
Since the bouncy is to cease by this bill that
advantage ~, striking it ous ?_The sense would
Ihll remain the fame : aud I don'r know why we
fliould make a law exprefly i 0 itrike out the
word ' bounty,' but to strike out the bounty it-
It is ft range to me, chat any gentleman, v. be.
'
ther he is for giving a great bounty, or no' boqn
ty at all, should quarrel with this un-fortunau
W u- ur T -M , e ,s , i . ndeed > Â°" c I"" of the fetftion,
which I will readily consent to strike out, an<fl
believe every other gentleman who is in favor of
the bill, will consent to it likewise ; and that is,
the clatife which provides, thar the bounty, to be
allowed and paid on every ve(lel,for one season,
shall not exceed one hundred and seventy dol
lars. If, when the vote is taken on the fedUon, '
there does not appear a majority of the house in
lavor of (Iriking Ã¼bt the whole, we may then
move for ftrikingTjiic the prov'ift,, if it be offeir
five to any gentleman : if it be not ofFenfive, it
may remain.
If gentlemen are disputing, only because the
\yot d 'â bounty in the bill, they may be per-
j clieved from their unea'juefs on that
score : for the bill cxprefsly f.tys " that the
bounty now allowed upon the exportation of dri
ed fifh, of the fifheries of the Unired States, (hall
ceal'c ; and in lieu thereof" a different kind of
enrouragement is to be given. Here is no reason
to dispute about a word : if gentlemen are dis
posed to content to the principle of the bill, that '
ibe drawback of the duties on fait ihall be com
muted for a certain sum to encourage the fifher
men, they will vote in favorof the hill :âif not,
they will vote against if. But it is impoilible for
ine to conceive, why any gentleman under hea
ven ftiould beagainlt it : it is only fixing, for
the merchants engaged in this branch, a clear
and equitable ratio, for difti ibuting among the
filherinen that encouragement, which they think
weceflavy in order to attach rhofe people to the
bufihefs, and to prevent them from going to
other occupations, on land. The bill is an im
portant one, and will encreafe that branch of
business, which is very ufeful to the community :
, â if does not lay a fqrthing of bounty, or duty
on any other persons, .than those who are imme
diately concerned in it:âit will serve them ;
and will not injure any body.
Mr. Lawrance said, from examining the fee
tion, he conceived ir contemplated no/note than
what the merchant is entitled to by exiltinglaws.
The merchant is now incitled to the drawback ;
but ir is found by experience that the effect ha!
not been to produce that encouragement to the
fifliermen which was expected ; and he prefunied
the way was perfectly clear to give a new direc
tion to the drawbackâand this is all that is aim
ed at in tile bill. He supposed that the clsnfe
had no neceflary connection with the qtieflion
which had been flatted, respeCting the right of
the government to grant bountiesâbut, fincethe
question ha 9 been brought forward, it may he
proper to consider it : In difcufiing the quefhon,
lie enquired, what has Cougrefs already done.
Have we not laid extra duties on various articles,
expressly for the purpose of enconrageing vaU '
ous branches of our own manufactures âthel*
dutiesare bounties to all intents and purposes,
and are founded on the idea only of their con u
cing to t-he general interefl- âSimilar objections to
those now advanced, were not made to "
tiesâthey were advocated (some of tliem) '7
gentlemen from the Southward ; he traced t e
effects of these duties, and (hewed that they or-
ated fully, as indirect bounties
Mr. Lawrance then adverted particularly t
the constitutionâand observed that it c Â° nt^ f
general principles and powers onlyâthe epÂ°
ers depend 011 particular laws for their operatio Â»
and on this idea he contended that the PÂ°/i aJI .
of the government must, in various cl ' cll .
ces extend to the granting bounties ; - 1,1
ced in cafe of a war with a foreign P ower ' elit
any gentleman fay that the geneim goven
has not a power to grant a bounty 011 a'--' >
ammunition, &c. fhoold the genera
quire it ? The general welfare .* '"leg
connected with any object or puifii'
itt- effect sadds to the 1 iches of the <o" n .conceived that the argument was given up by
gentlemen in opposition to the bill, when they
admjt of encouragement to the fifliermen in any
possible modification of it. He then adverted
particularly to the fisheries ; dated the n,umber
of men employed, the tons of {hipping necell'a
ry to export the fi(h taken ; and inferred the
found policy of encouraging so important a
branch of bufinÂ£fs.
Gentlemen fay that we do not want a navyâ
grant itâbut can they fay that we iliall never
have a war with any European power ? May not
the time arrive when the protection to the com
merce of this country, derived from this foiirce
juay be of the utmolt neceflity to its exiflence.
Adverting to Mr, Williamfon's objection from
the unequal operation of bountiesâand who had
referred to the article of the constitution which
fays that taxes fhnll be equal, in all the States ;
Mr. Lawrance observed that this article in the
constitution cotild only refpetft the rates of the
duties, and'that the fame duties should be paid
in Virginia that are paid in New-Yorkâat the
Northward, as at the Southward ; it surely could
not mean that every individual fiiould pay ex
actly the fame fuui in every part of the union ;
this was a provision that no law could pofiibly
contemplate.
He concluded by a fuinmary recapitulation of
his arguments âand faying he hoped the fetfiion
would be retained.

To be SOLD peremptorily, at Public Vendue,on Wednesday
the 11th day of April next,
HPHE SEAT of the late Dotftor Lewis fohnflon,
-*â  deceased, in Pefth-Amboy, containing TWO HUNDRED
ACRES of LAND.
This place is bounded southerly for near a mile on the river
Raritan,ywhere it empties intoihe bay about 18 miles from Sandy-
Hook, and affords two most agreeable foliations lor
Seats. "1 iiere are now on it, two brick houses, with gardens, and
a good collection of truit trees ot the bell kinds. The land is v; ry
fertile, arid a great part of it very good meadow ; and from us situ
ation on the river, has the advantage of fvfh of different kinds, lu
their seasons, particularly ofoyftersand chicken clams, which may
be picked in great plenty on the flats before the doors. It is a
delightful, health v (ituation, capable of genteel and tasty improve
ments; and as Perth-Amboy is one ot the best sea-ports in the
United States, and within 18 miles of the sea, the proipeCl ot 11s
ncreafinÂ£ in value from that circumstance, is by no means iucon
fiderable.
Theie wil' alio be foM, other Lots, within the bounds of the
city, arid about Five Hundred Acres of Land on the oppo(i r e fide
of the river Raritanâpart of which is improved by a farmâon
which there is a framed dwelling-house and barn, with an orchard
of grafted apple trees, ?nd will contain about one hundred and
fifty acres; the remainder will be fold in convenient lots, well
wooded 4iid timbered, and very convenient for supplying New-

L'kewife to be SOLD, at the J&rnc tine and place,
ELEVEN ACRES of LAND, adjoining the above, the pro
peity of the Pioprictors of Eft New-Jersey, wheie n the pio
prietary house lately stood. Theelegani situation of this spot is
Hardly to be equalled; it affords a grand profpett of Raritan
R y, and of the Bay formed by the waters of Raritan and Hud
Â»n's rivers, where they disembogue into the sea to the Eastâand
moll delightful one of the serpentine courfeof the Raritan river,
r several miles, through a rich tratt of meadow to the Weft!
The great quantify of stone neatly dre fled, and brick, the remains
rhe houle lately burned, will be nearly fufficient for a new
uilding; and a large stone cistern, and well of excellent waits,
with a very convenient ftabie and coach-house, will greatly leflrn
the ex pence of putting the place in order for the residence of a
Gent leman.â 1 here are few situations so eligible, particularly if
the fummcr seasonâwhen the cool sea breezes, and the elevated
filiations, render them places of pleasing retreat, from the confine
ment and sultry air of the fouthein Hates and nelghbouringcitics.
