REFLECTIONS on the STATE of the UNIOX.
A N enquiry into the knowledge or /kill, affi
a. A. duity, economy, or frugality, and good
management with which the several defecti
ons of citizens in the United States pursue their
employments, has never been made. The fub
jeft is copieus, and would require much previ
ous enquiry and detail. It is not intended,
therefore, in this place to attempt a develope
mentofit : yet it may be serviceable to be
stow up 0:1 it a few brief reflections. The learn
ed profellious will not be brought into view, as
tney are not ftrktly of the nature of the obieft
contemplated. The planters, the farmers, the
merchants, the navigators, the fifliermen, the
ihipbuilders, the manufacturers and the mecha
nics, with the perlbns immediately employed
by tnem, are all which are conceived to be
comprehended in the fubjeft. The body of the
planters, that is, those who cultivate tobacco,
rice, indigo, and cotton, are, as a general de
scription of cultivators, the bell informed in
regard to the object of their particular pursuit,
though it is manifeft that they have abundant
| matter for increased attention in perfecting
| their cultivation, in ascertaining those species
! of their valuable plants, which are molt excel
lent, molt certain, and most productive, in the
improvement of tiieir implements of hulbandry,
in the acquisition of auxiliary implements and
machinery, in perfecting the modes of curing
their produce, and preparing it for market, and
particularly in the attainment of an adequate
substitute for the ordinary species of labourers,
a supply of which has become precarious. It
appears to be worth their considering, too, as
well with an eye to profit, as humanity, whe
ther an advantageous variation in the employ
ment of some of the blacks might not be made,
by introducing upon every estate some of the
ampler manufactures to employ children, old
and invalid persons ot both sexes, and . particu
larly the females during that term when two
lives depend upon their health.
Tae merchants, navigators, fi(hermen, and
(hipbuitders of the United States, may be fafelv
affirmed to be four descriptions of our citizens
whole industry is as uniformly energetic and
well directed, as those of any country in the
world, though it i 3 certain that a much ftrifter
economy prevails among persons of some fo
reign nations engaged in those pursuitsâan ex
ample demanding serious attention.
The manufacturers in some branches pursue
their occupations under the disadvantages of
very ftw errors ; yet those citizens would be
fenlibly benefited, were they able to relieve
themselves of certain parts of their labor by
the attainment of the auxiliary machinery,
which are the purchase of larger capitals than
are yet engaged in their line. Circumstances,
however, of various kinds', are daily conti tout
ing to remove this inconvenience. The bu:k
of the manufacturers do not want industry, nor
Ikill enough to succeed in those simple manufac
tuies, to which it is moll their interest to apply
themselves. It may be rather said, that they
manufacture ordinary kinds of fabrics, from
the nature of the demand, than that they iria
nufaflure badly. Their bufmefs is, moreover,
prograffiveiy advancing, and has felt, on seve
ral occaiion;, some of them recent, the foltering
hand of government. Â°
The mechanic branches have been, til!. this
time, on nearly as good a footing; but those
employed in the erection ofbuildings ought now
to seek the aid of such parts of science is have
relation to their calling. Architecture has been
little (tud'.ed. It ought not to be forgotten,
that a competent knowledge of it is no lei's
conducive to economy and convenience, than
to elegance and splendor.
The moil importantcf all the employment!
of our citizens, that of the farmer, remains to be
noticed. It is very mich to be feared, that ii
po'nt of execution, ?. caidid examination would
prove that this belt of pursuits is most imper
fsdtly conducted,, at ledt la the grain state;.

Concerning the nationalindujiry.

| The proofs are, innumerable instances of impo
verilhed lands, bodies of meadow land?, in the
old settlement-, which remain in a state of
nature, an almolt universal inattention to the
making or prefervlng of manure, the frequent
inattention to the condition cf the feed grain,
evidenced by the growth of inferior grain in
fields of wheat, and by the complexion of the
flour in some quarters, the bad condition of
barns, stables and fences, and in some places the
total want of the former, tie deficiency of
spring-houses or other cool dairies in extensive
tracts as country, the want, or a trifling flock,
of bees, t e frequent want of orchards, and the
neglect of those which have been planted by
preceding occupants, the neglect of the sugar
tree, the neglect of fallen timber and fuel, "ac
companied with the wanton felling of timber
trees for fuel, the neglett of household manu
factures in many families, the neglect of mak
ing pot-sfh, the non-use of oxen, and above all,
the growth in fnbftance, of large bodies of farm
ers on lands of ordinary quality, while the in
habitants of extensive scenes, hardly extract
from much superior lands, a miserable fufte
nar.ee and more miserable clothing.
It is a fact very painful to observe, and un
pleaiunt to represent, but it is indubitably true,
that farming in the grain states, their great best
business, the employment molt precious in free
governments, is, too generally speaking, the
least understood, or the least economically and
attentively purl'ued, of any of the occupations
which engage the citizens of the United States.
It is acknowledged, however, with fatisfaftion,
that great changes have been lately made, and
that the energy, spirit of improvement, and eco
nomy, which have been recently displayed, pro
mise the regular and rapid melioration of the
agricultural system. All other things have tak
en a course of great improvementâand it can
not be apprehended that, the yeomanry of the
United States will permit themselves to be ex
celled by any of their brethren, in themoft pre- '
cious charaaeriftic of a good citizenâu/e/ulne/i
in their proper Jphere.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
Mr. Fenno,
If the following Jhould.be deemed worthy of a place in
your Gazette, by inferring tt you wiUftrvc the caufc
of truth and your country.
THE molt judicious wiiters on civil government
are agreed that a general prevalence of virtue
among the citizcns is tfllntial to the existence and
permanency of a republic, and experience proves
the opinion to be well founded. It becomes the
United Ssates therefore, as they wiih to secure the
blessings of freedom and independence to them
selves and posterity, to inspire the riling genera
tion with a sacred regard to truth and justice, and
.to favour ihe cultivation of such pnnciples as will :
give liability and dignity to their em pire. The
most effectual way to accomplish this end is to
promote the interdls of true religionâVirtue de
rives all its force and propriety, all its reason and
beauty from religion ; diOblve the alliance, and
you st once reduce it to a mere speculative prin
ciple, and diveftit of all its authority.
No o;her principle can supply the place of reli
gion the sense of honor and (hamcâ ihe
beauty of propriety and the reason and necefli
ty of fubmiiting to the decision of ihe majo
rity, are weak rt liraints to men in the eager pur
suits of their plcalures and paflions. The conlli
tuition of human nature, as well as the hillory of
civil society evinces the neccfiity of fomc authori
tative principle, that wiil penetrate the heart and
afford an invariable fanftion to the rules of social
and moral duty.
How preposterous is theconduft of those who
declaim upon the progrcfs of ariOocratical princi
pics in this country, and at the fame time endea
vour by their writings,their innuendoes,their anec
dotes, and indeed by every means in their power
to l. flen the inflnence of those principles which
form the only bafts of a popular government.
Whence is it that the clergy are indiscriminately
blackened under the odious name of priest, and re
ligion, fcandalizrd under the falfe appellation of
fupr.ftuion and prieftcraft ? Is there any thing that
these declaimers have deviftd as a fuhftitute for
religion, that will be more effectual to produce
virtue among mankind? If they have, Jet them
make known the discovery, they Dull have the
honour of it, and be icwaided ! r their pains.â
But il not, lit them keep filencc, or speak confif.
tentlv.âThe roan who endeavours to undermine
religion, saps the foundation of mora] virtue, re-
Ijxcs the principles of social obligation, and whe
ther-+ie knows it or not, advocates the cauTe of
anarchy or dcfpotifin.âls there any cbfs of men'
mi (he tinned States, who have difroverrd a more
finccre and ardent attachment to the principle of
ilie revolution than the clergy in general? Are
<here any who contributed more in their fpberes
to accompliQi it ? Were there any who displayed
more fortitude, or did moreto support the finking]
fpirjts ol their fellow citizens in the darkest Ibgejl
of ihe war ? Are (here any who have given a morel
ready reception to such measures as have been ge
nerally thought conducive to the intercfts ot this
â country ? And are there anv less exceptionable in
their general deponment than they? How then
â ve *hey provoked such abuse as certain writers
are conuantly calling on thein ?
Can it be affirmed that they are a factious, dis
contented ambitious class of citizens? Are they
ltivcfUd with dangerous privileges ? Aic ihey dis
posed to form combination* the measures
[Whole No. 454.]
lr, n Â» fnt? , Are ,hey " in pro
por.io.l to lOC 01 lur c'afiVs of cures Â» 4 to d â r
comoinations eafyot dangerous ? Do they by their
tonverfat ion or writing. endeavour to enflam. the
t7,",'h ! ! ? rcnd.Mhcmuof.icmliv
to the law,? Arc tlrey cnlrulted with 100 lmic f,
power? Have they too great revenues for citizens
"f a free country ? Or have a .lanoerons , n i
' fl'.ence in the councils of il.eir ? 'Some one
or more of theft- cha.ges n,,,8 b. supported m
â  oroet to give a fiudow of truih or uropriety to
the repiefentations ot certain writers; and 1 am
well peiftiÃded, that there is not a man in the
United States who is not an ideot or wurfe who
would openly attempt to flppon them.
The clergy, as far as inuocciice of manners-*
uprighmefs of conduit, and JivÂ« devoted to the
rtioit benevolent purposes can render them, are
worthy of the eltecm and approbation of their
fellow ciu?ens. They have more individual in
tluence in naming ourcit.rens to the habits of so.
brtety,and industryâin forming the manneis of
our youth and 111 impressing theiâ with fentintentÂ»
of virtue and morality, and in genera! in rtfeaine
the ends of civil government, than any denomina
tion ofcitizens whatever ; and what greatly en
hances their mei it is, that they have volunlKiily
ieclude<J thcmtclvcs from ftiartug the emoluments
of government ; they have renounced the profprct
of wealth of honor, and of office, and have devo
ted their time and talents to the bell interells of
their country. Judge then yc wliofe finis are not
utterly devoid ot sensibility, if Rich difinterrftrd
nefs merits no better return than derision and in
fuk ; if any clals of citizens defer ves the cfteem of
the public, it is that of the clergy ; the faenficts
which they make, and the benefits which they con
tribute principally to procure, entitle them at leait
to the gratitude of country. If thefc writers
have any reasonable exceptions againll the clergy
m any refpetf, let them (late them openly and can
didly, and not affoflin-like divulge their Icandal
in so aitful and dailardly a mannei as to pioctirc
reception by its association with truth, and thus
deprive the friends of virtue ot any suitable mbde
of defence.
Such condufl confideied either in a moral or
political view is abominableâit i s beneath the
character ol a man ot sense or talle ; it is a r.o:o
---rious breach of good mannersâa giofs inlult to
'clings and opinions of their fellow-citizens
and tends ultimately to the deftruftion of our owÂ»
conftnution and of all free government.â But wha'
renders then eonduft the more dctcftable is, tha[
like Satan who ensnared and ruined our fiift Da
rent, by profeffionsof Iriendlhip and auachment"
they pretend a zeal (or equal liberty and the r'ehts
ot men, and under this mask endeavor to propa
gate opinions defirua.ve of all order and subordi
nation in foeieiy and utterly fubvei fiveof the ii,iâ-
ciples that eonftitulc the only baits of civil Co
vernment. Â°
Thele gentlemen if we may judge from the spe
cimens they have given us ot rheir opinions have
quite outdone Epicurus, and all the Atheists and
. 1 * sol ancteiir or modern times. They never de
n 'ho ncceffity of religion to civ,l govern
ment, but on the contrary, they supported the Â»e
---celliry of maintaining the appearance o( it though
iney dilbclieved Kg reality. 6
But it thrfe writers are resolved at all events to
Obtrude their sentiments upon the public; I would
advise them-to abridge the labour by uublifhine
Â»t onte a new cdm 9 n of Tindal-TolandâChubb
âor some other of that Iraternity, as they are now
out of print as well as out of credit ; and try v he
ther their beloved doctrines will succeed better in
this country than tliey did in Gie-t-Britam.
This in iny opinion would be a much better
way, and I am sure a much more honourable way
than to retail their principle, by scraps, and that
without the genius or taste of the original writers
I am not a clergyman and therefore have Ipo
ken the more freely, but I am certain I speak the
lemimenu of a very large proportion ot my fel
low-cmzens, and I think ot every one not blind
ed by prejudice or d .veiled ol the feelings of hu
manits'. I am your's, &c.

The ill success of the fir It invasion
on the part of the French is the more
fortunate for our government, as the
public tranquility is not too well se
cured in our provinces. No diltrict,
village, or individual, it is true, de
clared for them, on the entrance of
their troops, though the enterprise
was planned by the French miniltry
oil that supposition. The partizans,
however, of the famous Vander Noot
do not seem inclined to remain quiet;
they have taken advantage of the mo
ment when the cities in the interior
parts of the country were furniflied
with troops, to raise the people in
various places, and urge them, to the
commission ofexceffesat Dielt. They
have mal treated a number of rel'-
petfable citizens, destroyed their pro
perty, pillaged and damaged their
houles, and committed all the outra
ges that the spirit of party could com
pel them to. The monks, we are as
sured, are at the head of these fana
ticks, and have seduced them under
the pretence that those whom they
insulted were Vonekiefti, or royal ene
mies to the constitution of Brabant.
At Louvainethere has been aconflidt
between the citizens and the students,
the martial law was proclaimed, and
they fired on those who, in spite of it,
continued riotous, by which many
persons were killed. Yesterday morn

ther of dragoons, and some artillery,
set off, from Brnflels, to restore tran
quility in those two cities.

The villainous attempt which ap
peared last week, to burn down the
Hobfes of Parliament, and some other
circumstances, join to tell us, that
there are turbulent spirits who have
set a party to work to make such ir.if
chiefhere; but the gteateft part of
the people are fatisfied and happy in
comparing our (late with that of the
neighboring nations ; and it is to be
hoped, that the eyes of government
are on the watch, and steadily resolv
ed, to pnnifh in an examplary man
ner, all those who are traiteroufly en
deavoring to introduce niifchief and
confufion among us.

CONCORD, (N. 11.) July i 3.
It is fafliionable to rail at every
thing (whether just or unjust it mat
ters not) which is contrary to public
â whimâ or, in other words, which is
not Illicitly cultomary. It was a cuf
torn, for many years, for people, in
different parts of the United States,
to receive newlpapers by the mails,
free of postageâThis was a cujlomâ
But J USTICK awakes with the new,
efficient government, and points out
a more equitable modeâThe Guardi
ans of our Liberties do not fee any
iujultice in a man's paying for tranf
porting his newlpapers, even if they
be transported in the public mailâ
nor do they fee the justice of an in
dividual's employing a fervent of the
public in his own private business,
without compensating the public
thereforâHence, we suppose, they
thought themselves wholly jultifiable
in laying poltage on newlpapers car
lied in the mail :âlnconsequence of
'this, many have ltrove to traduce the
c-haratfter of Congress, and have hal
looed in the people's ears, that the
liberty of theprefsis infringedâthat
despotism begins to prevail â that our
rulers will enllave us, &c. But noâ
this is not lioneft dealingâThe liber
ty of the press remains fecureâTho*
Congress may have infringed tiie right
of transporting newlpapers in the
public mail, free of ty.pt.nfe to individu
alsâthey have not infringed the'
Freedom of the Press ! It is yet Free
ânor are our papers J, lamped !âThe
present eltablifhment renders the ex
change of papers, between the re
fpec r tive printers 011 the continent,
more sure than ever it was before
since the birth day of America : â
Postmasters are now bound by law to
forward all exchange papers to the
printersâbefore they were not âof
confeqnence the circulation of News
is more certain and extenliveâThe
printers in New-Hanipfhire may now
receive papers from the printers in
Georgia, or any other state in the
Union, regularlyâTherefore, the li
berty of the press is not infringed â
The tax on subscribers' newspapers
is certainly JUST âNor is the tax ex
travagant âthough perhaps half the
ftim might have answered the pur
! pose. The portage on a weekly pa
per, conveyed in the mail from Phi
ladelphia to thecentre of New-Hainp
(hire, will be but very little more
than a private post would charge, for
conveying the i'ame paper from the
centre of New-Hainpfliire to the ex
tremity thereofâa distance, perhaps,
of about one fifth. Those whodecry
the tax, are those only whole private
interells interfereâat: least, their ob
jections cannot arise from a republi
can fpiritâbuc from a quite different
: cause : it is because they are obliged
to pay for a benefit, which they long
enjoyed gratis, but for which they
ought always to have paid. Is the
government under obligations to fend
newspapers to individuals, who chitfe
to take them, from New-Hatnpfhire
to Georgia, free of portage? An in
dividual has as J tilt aright to demand
a liorfe to ride a journey of that dis
tance, pn private business of his own,
and to hive his expenses defrayed
by the publicâThe tax on papers is
uo more an infringement on the press,
than a private port rider's refufing to
distribute papers through the coun
try, gratis, would be. If people were
once iKcuftotiitd to it they would de
mand, as a jurt claim, a fee for receiv
ing newspapers gratisâand would
(ay, the liberty of the press was in
fringed, if the fee were not paid.â
The government does not compel
people to receive newspapers by the
mailânor does it debar them the pri
vilege of using any other mean that
they may find more convenient. And
till individuals are willing to trans
port the mail for the public, gratis,
they ought not to expert the free
transportation of their newspapers.
Where is the Justice of it ? In truth,
Justice is out of the playâand a felf
ijh difpofttion, dangerous inaÃepub
licati country, is fubllituted. Because
we were once indulged in receiving
our papers free of postage, shall wc
lay it is nnjuft if we not always gra
tified in that way ? We jnight, with
equal propriety, ttaintain, that be
cause our forefathers wore Jhortcoats,
i t is nnjull, tyraniical, and antifede-
I'al, for us to wear hng ones !

THE GOOD WIFE.
HILE in the labyrinth that Fafhionfcrm,
Some Wives are loft, and round its mazes roam,
The good Wife guards her children from the
storms
That Life annexes to this transient home.
Content to fee their new ideas rife,
And their young heads get nearer to the ikies.
Mulic can thrill thro' many a nervous fair,
Whose nerves no infant-accents ever mov'd;
Stage mimic Misery draw the real tear,
And mimic Lovers show them how th*y lov'd.
Music and Love wait here the HnlbancKs step,
AncJ her's the foirow, when her children weep.
Rais'd where at mountain-heightHygeia lives,
Above the. glare that gaudy grandeur Ihows;
The trusty, good Wife raiies future Wives,
And her kind breast with kindlier transport glows.
As pleas'd, (he views the prattling brood in
cieafe,
And each new comer bring the branch of
peace.
Though gewgaw Gaiety should fliun her way,
And Science spurn her from his lofty height,
'Tis not for her to flaihâ-a u meteor day,"
Or trace the comet in his vagrant flight.
Enough (he knows, her seasons roll serene,
Her good Man happy, and her Infants clean.
The Sun's Srlt light still fees the good Wife rite,
His ray of noon still cheers her*ufeful toil,
His htft faint beam oft lingers in the ikies,
As loth the tender intercourse to spoil.
And friendly Night that shields her while at
reft,
Light lays his (hadows on her peaceful breast.

having cannonaded and bombarded it for 48
hours'fucceffively, with a formidable train of
artillery, and then carried it by aflault as soon
as the breaches were fufficient to render it prac

1500 ptifoners, and only loft sdo men in the ac

French entered the town, where the inhabitants
were dieffed in the national cockade,and where
â¦he three coloured flag was unfurled and orna

The Mayor of Paris being informed that the
King of the French intended to quit that city,
gave notice to the commandant of the forces
to be on his guard.
The King was offended, and in a letter to the
municipality of Paris, alks, " Why does the
Mayor, in conleqnence ot'luch peports, give or
ders to the Commandant-General, and commu
nicate nothing to me, since it is his duty by the
Conflitution to execute my direction for the
maintenance of the pnblic tranquility ?"
The Mayor, in reply to the King, has pub
lished a statement of various particulars, to
/hew that the extraordinary movements at the
palace at that time, and the crouds allembled
round the ThuiUeries, with other interesting
particulars, rendered it proper and indifpenia
bly necelfary to take the ilieafures he had
adopted.
In answer to the King's remark, that it was
the Mayor's duty by the Constitution to apply
to him, M. Pethion fays, " It is incorrect to
fay he ought to have taken the King's orders;
idr itwould then be theKingwho would govern
the police ot Paris, who wonld communicate his
pleasure to the Mayor, who would have to
transmit it to the guard;âthe King would also
be the actual commanderoftheNationalGuard,

The Mayor concludes his letter by faying,
that if the King himfelf had been to take pre
cautions for the public tranquility, and for the

COMMUNICATIONS.
The right of fuffrage is a most sacred deposit
which every freeman ftiould be tenacious of as
tlie pledge of his own liberty and that of poste
rity. The right exercile of this important pri
vilege is a consideration of the utmost impor
tance.âThe cunning and unprincipled politician
will leave no artifice untried to bewilder and
perplex the honest and unfufpefting voter in
giving his fuifrageâbut to the unbiall'ed and in
dependent mind, no duty is more plain and sim
ple. Honesty and ability are the grand requi
sites for a candidate ; where these are wanting,
no prufejjions ought to availâfor without them
there is no security, and expedition will most
alfutedly be disappointed.
Parties willexift in most governmentsâin a
free their features are perhaps more
ftrikirigly portrayed than in a despotism. It
would be aifrontive to common sense to lay that
they are unknown in the United States.
The government of the people, such an one
is that of this country, and of every free repub
lic, knows no party âbecause the majority of
the people can never be a party agamft them
lelvesâ the supposition is a gross abiui di*yâ
those therefore whd oppose the government,
are the party. Tiiere are men among us who
have always been known as partizans, and vio
lent ones tooâ these fay they are opposed to the
tn ajuns of the government only. But let me
mory do its ollice. They have ever been hos
tile to the Constitution of the United Statesâ
and if they now pretend to be converted, their
conversion is only a pretence, a medium by
which they mean to introduce themlelves into
powerâ-to administer a government they are
in heart opposed to.âCan there be any fafety
in trusting such characters ?
The party that is out naturally wiihes to get
in to place. They consider those who are in of
fice as adversaries who must be driven out. To
have enemies is bad enoughâbut to be lubjett
to their power, is ten times worse. The outs
therefore consider the power of the government
administered by their opponents as the power
of their enemies. Hence we find them praising
their proud spirit "which scorns to flatter at
courtâtheir hatred and jealousy of power
which is always on the watch, and their scorn of
tbofe who eat the bread of office. They put i
the indulgence of their palfions on a rank with
the virtue which fubjefts them to reason, and
they seem to admire, with a spirit as sincere as
it is enthusiastic, the purity of their views, the
genuineness of their repubiicanifm, and the ar
dor with which they labor, to better their condition.
The English of all this regard for liberty among
this junto, is, they hate their adversaries, and
are trying to get help to overcome them. Of
them it is eminently true, that felf-love and
public are the fame. The cur that is (hut out
of doors will surely bark, especially in cold
nijbtsâbut open the door, and he sneaks into
the chimney corner silent and fatisfied. If a
{hanger approach, however, he barks again
with fury, and threatens to bite.âWhich of our
giumblers would not be fatisfied with a bone ?

It/will not bp tjie fault of certain restless cha
racters among burielves, if the tauhtii.gpredic
tions of our tormer enemies are not fu.iult.-u.â>â 
It was laid by them, " that tin; Union of the
States would prove a rope of fatiiiâthat the
dil'pofition of tiie people of this country was 10
fickle and capricious, that when once rclealed
from their connection wicÂ»i Great-Britain, and
their dependance on Bntifh power, tney would
never be able to iorm any government of their
own, for the preservation of perfonaj freedom
and personal property." The woiid has ieen
that tliefe imputations were unfounded, that
they resulted from spleen and dilappointiuent.
We have eitablilhed a government which the
patriotic world admires. We have prolpered
under the adpiiniftration of that government
beyond the anticipations and molt ianguinc
hopes of its friendsâand the prolpeCt before
us, while the fame wile and judicious plans are
pursued, is boundiefs. From hence we may
juftJy infer, that the machinations of thole who
ate so indefatigable in dilfem.nating jsaloufies,
propagating llanders, and pouring out abulc in
refpeft to this government and its meaiures,
are no better than agents in the bleffea work of
fulfilling the prophelies of our enemies. The
good fenie of the people will however prove a
bulwark agalnlt their devices.

AMONG the various descriptions of persons
in a free community, there is none perhaps
that ought to be watched with greater caution
than the cunning politician. There are many of
thi; denomination extant now-a-daysâand at
the feafoft of elections luch are always peculiar-
Ily busy and alert. Some might be mentioned
who have never diftinguilhed themlelvci inuuy
manner, but by their oppolition to thole mea
(iires which have proved the salvation of our
countryâand have placed on a firm foundation
the hopes of every indultrious citizen.âOthers
there are, whose genuine character and princi
ples are not so fully developed as that a proper
opinion can be formed of them. Sureiy no wile
man will put his confidence in thole who, from
several circumstances which might be mention
ed, it is impollible should be known to the peo
ple.âThe old adageâTrujl vo one on a flight uc
quatnt&nceâ-applies with peculiar force to mat
ters of political public concern.âA man desti
tute of modesty, is generally defiitute of hones
ty.âThe electors of this commonwealth, and
of this city in particular, have been repeatedly
admonished to be on their guard againlt the de
signs of the leaders of parties âbut these admo
nitions are principally designed to counteract
the views of those who wiih that the people
should take effectual measures to promote a
concert of views in feledting the most worthy
and confidential characters to reprelent them
in Congress.âSurely it is of the greater im
poi tance that the aggregate body of citizens
lhouldaft underflandiqgly in this important bu
sinessâthat they fliould be united as far as pof-.
fibleâthat they lliould give their votes from
information, sentiment and principle, and a
full persuasion that their fuflrages are bellowed
on the molt meritorious characters.âlt is noto
rious that parties exilt in the Stateâthose who
fay they do not, are molt undoubtedly taking
measures which will prove that their ailertions
to the contrary are meant to deceive.
Let the free electors reflect in time on cha
raÃcrs, profejfions and principlesâand determine
in due l'ealon what they will doâfor thole canÂ«
did,cunning politicians, who are so much afraid
that a delegation of the right oi fufirage Iliould
take place, have been the firft to controul the
opinion of the people, by secret nominations.â
" Prove all thingsâhold fact that which is good."
