FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE VSITED STATES.
MR. FEiNNO,
THE funding fyllem is alledged to be contrary to republican
principles. I am a zealous republican. I have neard a
gieat manv high wrought fpc< chesand have read at leafl a thonfand
cutting keen p-tagraphsin the ncv (papers (hewing the danger
th.it our principles are exoofed to. What is a man good for il he
hjs not principles.â He is not fit to be hangedâor if you will, he
is fit; for you may have it as you please. Now, Sir, I am pei
feftly found and well fixed in mv principles. One is that the
public is to be preferred to the individualâthat is patriotic, and I
niavfay it in modeftv, it is mu. hto mv honor. Paying debts,
fay the paperÂ«, is anti-republicanâthe lunding fyflem is anti-re
publican. I owe d*bis, and wilb the advice of the writers in the
nrwfpaper* with regard to my cafe.âlt is a cafe of conscience.
I ain in tiade, and having run in debt for my flock, I have eat
and diank the profits âfor a man mud live you know, fir. Whe
ther it is anti-republican to pav private debts, as ii certainly is for
Cougrefs to pay those of the public is my doubt ; I do not readi
]v fee the d'ffcrcnceâand this difficulty of my cafe is not to be
overcome unless by confirming the opinion I incline to adopt,
that the payment of mv debis is improper for a republican. In
some refp. els it is worf- than paving public debts, For the fin
]if at 3 man'* own door; he makes it his own private ail. Ano
ther poini seems in my affair clearer flill. My creditors are very
rich and are growing richer. This overgrown wealth is tgreed
to be improper in a Hate of republican equality ; (Rail I then by
pav'ngthem add to 'his inequality and dcllroy the just balance
the modcll and vir'uous level which ought to be maintained. No
my coun'ry is to be ' r ferred to niyfelt ; and the creditois, if they
are good cuizenswill refpeft mv principles anil bequietâ if tbey
arc not good citizens lhall I pamper them with my money ? No,
I will not : Therefore I do not much infill on having mv cafe of
conscience folvedâfor I have resolved what to doâor rather
w.'i r I will forbear do^ng.
H?ving begun to scribble about principles, I find I have more
to fay, though I have finiftied the point I fir.ft intended to state.
The public fpw 'ted and iroly virtuous wiiiers against the funding
system do not spare the speculators. Vipers ! I like to fee them
well threshed. The do&rine of equal rights has b en strained by
some to fuchextravagance as to admit that they have equal rights
â with other citizens : But every rule has it* exceptions, and Con
gress Ihould luve made-them. The\ should h<>ve said in then
funding (awâproperty's found ; k is every man's own, and we
canno: touch itâexcepting however the property of the holders
of the public cetrificar; % and also of such other perf >ns as Con
go's on the ground of this precedent fh sll tlrnk fit by decrees
from time to time to except, and as the public good in their o
pinion may require. The widows and fatherlefs should have
been provided forâforne persons have hastily obie&ed to this hu
mane Dlea for the widows and orphans who held certificates and
have fold then-, that it relief had been given them, the provision
for them bv law would have been a funding law, and of course as
unconftirutional and anti-republican as the ex sting act. This is
a (hallow objectionâtalking and writing in favor of poor orphans
lays no taxâdoes no violence to the conftitu,tion or to republican
equality; in fact a law might have been pasTed so as to create no
buiden. Wc h. ve as much as a folio of State laws for cancelling
their debts wSich never took a dollar out of their tjeafuries ; and
Congress might have done the like. But alas, with precept upon
precept from the newfpapersand the example of the States before
their eyes they have wilfully offended by their funding law a?a nfl
jurtice, principle, republicanifin and the poor widows. For all
which it appears the newspapers will never forgive them.
FROM THE CONNECTICUT COURANT.
MeflVs. Printers,
Or late, the newspapers have offered opinions which deserve
10 be well considered before they are received as truths. It
has beenfaid that we mud keep up a general government, because
we cannot have an union of the States without itâand according
to the frozen praile of these writers, the union is rather a good
thing than othcrwile. But we must npt have a jot more of a ge
neral government than just enough tor the union to rub and go, or
speaking more correctly to rub and not go : because fay they if
you give an inch more, consolidation will ensue, and consolida
tion is wo r fie thjn Ichifm, that is, than no union.
According to these new faugled federalifts, the movement of

ter is to be should lose a part of the power neceff.i y
for the union, and Congrcfs in this traffic of (enderntfs is to si r
left the States should want power to prevent a consolidationâat;
so there will be a great deal of love loft. It will be 1011, tor as he
baiance betwe> n the national and State governments is to be tri
in money scales, and nothing according to these writers, bur 'ovt

It will not be denied that separate leg'flatures are cxpofed to
the danger of clashing. The danger, however, is aggravated by

love it too well to futfer these men to execute upon it the

Tliefe writers have little atfcaion for the union or a flranje ap
orehenfion of futurity when they repreftot consolidation as woile
than schism or no union at all. It is not. easy to imagine what
could be worse than a d vision of the dates. The evil affoids no
room for palliatives. Rival or neighbour states could not remain
friends. Injuries would sharpen resentments, and hatred would
become hereditary And what could be gained or hoped for ?
With more enemies and those within our present limits, (honld
we have less armies or taxes? Would a weaker government de
lend us, or would its yoke fit lighter? Should we enjoy more 1,-
bfcrly, more tranquil.ty, or more wealth. What can be more
shocking to a nation than its d'flolution, than brothers becoming
enemies and seeking each other's blood.
Those writers who reprelent consolidation as wor r e than a fe.
oaration of the dates, arc great admirers of the French revolution.
France has indeed recovered its liberty, and one of the firft us. s
it made of it was to break down the provincial governments, and
to consolidate the whole nation into one body. France has f ven
times more people than the United States, a r.avy, colonies in
every quarter ot the earth, and a vail trade. The present happy
order of things is not to be changed to follow the example of
Franceâ tLit no mar. will believe that it is not better t/> adopt that
example than to (uffer a fcparation of the union. That we may
not be driven to this alternative, let ns contradict those who re
present confol;rtation as no improbable event, and yet as the worst
of all political evils.

FROM THOMAS', MASSACHUSETTS SPY, Q c .
Sutton, January it iiat
To Majler KIDDER.
SIR,
IT is a common report, that a school diftrift engaged yo.u to
teai h their school this winter; which school you set up and
tiught.fome days; but in the mean while anorhtV teacher wa/
*Â»nfulted, and a diftrifi meeting appointed to answer the requ ft
of a certain gentleman ; but his request was totally disregarded,
and the time fprnt in disputing, whether your government Ihould'
be regarded by treirchildren, or not. And wlion jhe vote was
four appeared for vour government, and (our against it.
Then one of your fchotars, who was under age, put in the calling
vote, which turned you out of the diffrift ; or you inuft give up
your government, which, by judicious men, is supposed to be
good. Now, Sir, whether this report be true, or talfe, I lenow
not ; and who the gentlemen are, is none of my business : But
the abovementioned report, is the occasion of my writing to vou
upon government. 1 Neither do I with to applv my observations
upon government, to those gentlemen in particular;, but tÂ» the
charafler deserving.
Government is an institution of Heaven. When maA was firft
formed, he was put under law and government; the violation of
which, has introduced into the world, all the evil which now s
or perhaps will be ; which was effe&ed by the instigation of rh.'
Hevil ; and by him and his emidaries, this rebellion is Ail! go-ng
on. But r.he feed of the woman hath undertaken to put a check
to it. and to introduce good order and government again ; whirh
he v ill do rfF'&ually amoug his children, which apparently dif
t ngnifhes them from the children of the devil. Now wherever
ou find godly parents, the man, according to the order of Hra
fÂ»n, izkes the lead, and the wife is in fubje&ion ; and their utmost
endeavor is to fubjett their children to good order. For the wel
fare of this rising nation, depends much upon the good govern
ment of paren s and school teachers, toward the blooming youth:
r or thr want ot which, the Sabbath may be violated, gaols crowd
d. whipping ports employed, and gallows s loaded, &c.
Now, Sir, a placed for tfce defrnce of thi* nation,
w-H be of no avail, if children may govern their parents; for pa
enf< mnft govern in state and town matters ; and if thev are go.
their children, and their children by the devil, then On
â¢ hose (boulders is government ?
To conclude, Sir, I was informed, that with all modrfty, vou
rood vonr ground like an heio : And an heÂ»o in the field, cannot
be ter serve his country, than vou can in your school, by fubjeft
i;ig your pupils to good order and government.
Frcm your friend.

Mr. Ashbil Kidder
P. S. If children can rule their parenrs and frhool teachf-is
w'nile under age, who is there whom thev cannot rule when thev
come to vears ? Thev feel every way-qualified to >ule kingdoms
and flairs; and all must bow to them, or there are di'Mirbancts in
neighbourhoods, rtoifv town-meetings, mobs, inlurrcttions; and
kingdoms and slates, by th**m are difqu:cted. This ground alio
produces tavern-haunting, horfe-jockying, caid-p'avtng, thieving,
robbrg, rioting, murder, and all manner of vicious prattlers.
But, will no: God ihorten their days ? Will not the earth Â»uen
her mouth quickly, and {wallow them uo, ;ts the did Korah ? For
by tbem the government ot Heaveq is struck at : I 1 To, the nei,-
lecfcof proper government, bv parents, maflcrs and school train
ers, " is no less than a wicked conspiracy, againlt both God and
inan."
I have only given you a general sketch of mv Simple thoughts
upon the education of children ; and more efpecLallv, some of
the ill confcquences which accrue from the neglcft of it. âThere-
fore, Jet us, bv our exam pies, teach them every point of pietv,

HOJJSE OF R E PRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, February 13.
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
On the neiu Reprcfcntation Bill.
SMITH (S. C.) in ihe Chair.âThe bill
-LVA was read through by the Clerk.
The firft section being repeated by the Chair
manâMr. Seney mowed that the blank in the
16th line should be filled with the word thirtyâ
which would determine that the ratio of repre
sentation should be 30,000.
This motion was opposed by Mr. Hillhoufe,on
the old groupd of its unequal operation.
â  Mr. Gerry replied to Mr. HillhoufeâHe ob
served that this apportionment 011 the aggregate
federal number, would be more equal than by the
ratio of 33,000 âbut this had been rejected by
the Senate j and as the ratio of 33,000 would not
perfe<ftly cure the difficulty, and would operate
to reduce the whole number of the representa
tives, he conceived that no new light had been
thrown on tfce fubjedt to induce the H'oufe to
confeAt to such diminution.
Mr. Mercer entered into a general view of the
fubjeJtâHe supported a large representationâ
and urged its importance, as it vefpetfts the de
mocratical part of the community.âThe theory
of government is the fame, said he, whether ii
refpeifis a free or a despotic government âit is
not a small number that can govern in any coun
try âStanding armies supply in despotic govern
ments, the place of a large reprefentatioi. in a
free governmentâStill the operations of govern
ment in both cases, depend on a large numberof
people.
The question for inferring 30,000 was carried
in the affirmative, 30 to 21.
Mr. Mercer then moved t'oftrike out the third
day of March, 1 793, and to insert the fii ft day of
October, j 79-2 ârefering to the period when the
states (hall be rep' efepted by the number arifiug
from the firlt enumeration.
HÂ£ informed the House that Virginia had al
ready made provision to fend forward their sup
plemenrary numbers.â He urged the right of the
states 1 efpec'tively to fill up their reprelentation
agreeable to the enumetation, See.
Mr. Gerry supported the motion.
Mr. Fillhoule suggested another modeâHe
proposed that thep'efent Congress fhonld expire
after the present session, and a new House be eledl
ed agreeable to the census, to meet at the time
to which the present Congress may be adjourned
âHe urged many advantages which would result
from this plan.
Mr. Mercer said his idea was, that the chufing
these additional members would be only filling
up vacancies.
Mr. Murray was for striking out the third day
of March, 1793, for the purpose of inferring an
earlier dayâThe great objection is an inconve
nienceâlt is said the members which now com
pose this House will have to continue by law ano
ther fellion, and 1 he fuppleniental members would
have to continue but to fill the intermediate fpaee
of time from the election to the third of March.
He begged gentlemen to give him leave to fay,
that the only possible obstacle to their thinking
as he did, arose from themselves :âfrom a defiie
he would not fay how disinterested, to continue
in power longer than they were entitled to re
main under the constitution. The ad: of Con
gress declaratory of the time which members
were to continue, was the sole obstacle 10 the gra
tification of the people in one of their bell rights
âThis ast, funded in error ought pi evioufly to
be repealed, and then no difficulty eiiher from
the conftrucftion of the constitution or from in
convenience, could be raised to the wifti that the
additional representatives should take their sea s
immediately after the next general election.
This act produced a mischievous and unthought
of solecism in the governmentâlt separated re
presentation from confidence, and violated re
fponfibiliry, which is the very foul of the govern
ment..âThe people could not but be aftonifiied.
that after the last generalelec r tion, the members of
Congress whom they had not chosen, still conti
nued there to hold their feats, and to act as upon
their confidence and trust. Surely one of the
most obvious truths in a government by repre
sentation is, that election (hall be the criterion
of confidenceâand that a continuance to dis
trust after it is withdrawn, overturns
every idea of representation He wished the
committee to reflect that the principal objection
to the motion was eaftly removed, if members
would a<s a disinterested part :âand that if it
be admitted that the duration of the present Con
gress is the obje&ion to the admission of the fup
pJemental members, gentlemen cannot helitate
between the gratification of what evidently ap
pears to be the rights of the people under a fair
conftrusftion of the constitution, and a declarato
ry law which is repealable, and which is so con
trary to realouâ'The objection is removableâ
the right is permanent. It is certainly of more
confeqoence to adhere to the principle of a just
aivd numerous representation, and to adopt an
early day to give it operation, than to give the
principle the go-by, merely to support a stretch
ed duration of our term, under a law Â»hat over
sets the mod obvious truths and reafoningon re
presentation. As to the members from Georgia,
if the law giving an extra term to the feats of
members were not repealed, he would still vote
for Georgia's having three members till the term
expiredâbut at all events he hoped the motion
[ would be agreed to.
The motion was finally disagreed to
TUESDAY, February 14
In committee of the -whole on the bill relative to thf
< "I r rÂ» r * ' -- " "
ilcÃion of a President and Vics-Preftdent, ire.
A motion made yafterday, to insert a clause
reftridling the number of electors to the number
of the present Senate and House of Reprefenta
tives being put and negatived.
Mr. Gerry moved to insert a clause, which
fpecifies that " the electors (hall be equal to the
number of Senatorsand Representatives, to which
the several States may by law be entitled at the
time when the Prefidentand Vice-President thus
to be chosen should come into office , provided
always that where no apportionment of Repre
sentatives shall have been made after any enu
meration, at the time of chufing electors, then
the number of electors shall be according to the
existing apportionment of Senators and Repre
sentatives."
This motion with very little objedtion was
adopted ; its propriety will appear from the
following remarks made by Mr. Murray who
("aid, lie was in favor of the wliole, both the pro
pofiiion and the proviso ; the fir ft meditates a
Wiore equal representation of the wishes of the
people of America in the election of the two
great officers of the State ; the proviso guards
against a confufion which might take place with
out the provision. The present representation
in Congress is by no means equalâthe States in
their conventional deliberation produced the
present proportion of representatives, more from
compromise than authenticated data ; no census
had then measured to the publip the proportions
of population, which one State bore to another,
and Reprefent&tives including Senators and elec
tors of President and Vice-President, being the
fame in number, and the scale of Representa
tives being unfounded in fatfts and evidence,
rhe inequality which is eviden t, is not to be won
dered at. This proposition remedies the ine
quality ; the proviso was not perfectly agreeable
to his wiflies ; but as it refers the number of elec
tors to a scale of representation ascertained b)
an actual enumeration, and at the fame time will
remove the probability of cÂ«nfuflon by making
each Sta-.e uniform with others as to the rule of
fixing the number of electors, he should vote foi
it. This was a great object attained. It is not
a difficult thing to forefee, without jealousy 01
suspicion, that unless the States are uniform as
i o the rule of apportioning electors, the repose
of the Union might be violated. Should this
law refer to an apportionment to be hereafter
made by Congress this event might take place.
A disagreement might happen between this House
and the Senate, and in the tumults and contu
macy by which they might be agitated towards
each other, no apportionment might be made ;
in this situation the executive would be left at
the mercy of the two Houses and the order of
things violently deranged.âBut even if the peo
ple having a census before them, though not
aJted on by Congress, were to make their elec
tions agreeably to what might be their refpec
tive ideas of the apportionment to which the
census apparently entitled them, yet we are not
certain that they would all acft by a uniform rule
âand if they acted without such rule, there might
appear before the tribunal of the public two Pre
sidents, or two men of great power claiming the
Presidency of AmericaâThis would be an evil
of great; and alarming sizeâand one which he
fomnch deprecated, that he willingly yielded
to the proviso, which he thought would tend to
leflen the opportunity by which designing men
could effect it. &
SATURDAY, March 17.
The Speaker laid before the House a Report
from the Secretary of the freafury, 011 the peti
tion of the trustees of WilminÂ«gron College, and
a report from the Attorney General, 011 the peti
tion of A. Jackson â which were read and order

To these causes may be traced the bitter rrvilings which fill
many of our pa pi rs of laic, a g:>i uft the management of public af
fairs. It is ihe mislonutie of mankind that tliey look lor happ -
m is in every other situation lhari that they happen to he in ; ex.
pefting to derive relief (torn every change, they rove from tiough
10 bough, not like the bee, to inhale their fwects, but in search or
thorns to enhance their pain.
Prior to that eventful petiod which g,ive us the form of govern
ment we now polfcfs, the mind was bo 1 nr on the wings of pleat
ing anticipation; this epoe.ha was anxiotifly looked to as the'oe
riod which* would produce the tiee of our political life; but'llo
sooner do we find ourfe'ves in the enjoyment of it, than the.coin
hand of difconterit is employed to chill its bioffoms, and deltroy
the maturity Â»f its fruit.
Government is ot too sacred and serious a nature, of too great
importance to the welfare of society, to be raised up as children do
their card houses, merely for the pleafureof tumbling them down
again.
It is a duty incumbent on those who are so ready to Tail at the
present plans of adminiftratiort, to offer feme fubftttute in their
Head; without this, their worK it but imperfectly done ; without
this, their views are but half visible; or may be justly prefumcd
to originate from flagitious principles : that the auihors ot them
are either weak or wicked, is the necclTary dedu&ion.
What opinion Ihould we tiave of a person, who, meeting us on
a journey, should inform us that the road we were in was nÂ«t Ihi
one leading to the place of our deftinatton, unless he proierdcd
o designate the true path ? Should we not fufpe& design mafkrd
under apparent friendfhip, and a wish to bewilder us, to anfwei
some finiflsr purpose ? We certainly (bould : then how fuperiorl>
aggravated must be his crime who endeavors to 11 gger the confi
dence of a whole people, in regard to those measures in whir'
they place their fafety and happiness, unless he points out the true
magnet leading to these invaluable objetts: happily their failure
in this refpeft, bv evincing the motives of their actions, tends to
obviate the malignity of their effeÂ£l.
There is a contiderable number of politicians in all government*,
who are always enemies to the present establishment ; not becauff
it is an ill orte, or becanfe those who administer it betiÂ»,y their
trust, bnt because they themselves are not in it.
Hiftorv, ancient and modern, i? replete with evidences of rht
ourfints above alluded to, and their fatal consequences. Such hav
been the favorite themes of the demagogu sos every age & country.
Such have ever been used as ftiirups by which to mount into the
(addle of power, to ride over the necks of their fellow-citizensâ
the most vociferous advocates fey liberty, have been often foun
its firft and most powerful enemies. It tÂ§ to be hoped that Ame
ricans, who have a government the offspring of unbiased judg
ment and found und<*rftandirÂ»g, will never p- rmit (he mists of pai
ty paflion or prejudice to cloud the rays of reason ; but that thro'
the whole tenor of their political existence, they will exemplify
to the world the superior power of public virtue.
By the Ship Britannia, arrived at New-York, in 32 days from
Greenock, accounts are received to 6th February :âThey state,
That the military preparations go on at Vienna, in Pruflia and
SwedenâThat rhe Emperor has revoked the amnesty giantcd
ro the States of Brabant âThat the Bishop of Treves has fulfilled
what was required of him by the law of nations in refpefl to the
French emigrantsâThat the refugees in his estates cannot be
considered but as peaccable travellers and fojournersâThat an
embargo has been laid on all (hips at Dunkirk,âthis being
construed by the diunicipality to extend to French veflels, the En
glish (hipping failed immediatelyâThe Swallow packet has ar
rived from India ; Lord Cornwall's army had returned to Ban

been molested bv Tippoo The EnÂ»lifh have taken the Fo<t

nounced his intqr.tion to attack.
In August Tippoo attacked Coimbatur, but was repuHed
A party ot the Mahrattas, who continue hrm to the English, had
been defeated by Tippoo, and loft 7,000 men.
It does not appear that Lord Cornwallis had re-commenced
his operations for the captuie of Seringapatam.
Fresh overtures of treating had been made by Tippooâbut
Lord Cornwallis refufed to treat in any way but that of writing.

1 lie malignant pleasure of blamingthe prc

mankind by and has been continued by
moialifts to this dayâEvery warm patriot mult
feel in bis own bread a refutation of the calum
ny" -as it may be extended to the fltuatioii of
the United States. We cannot, however, please
ourselves with the expectation of an uuiverfal
approbation either of constitution, laws, men or
meafuresâfor there are, and always will be, per
(ons of so peculiar a calf, that they feein fated to
deri e no fat,isfa<ftion from contemplating the
works of either God or man.
Tht? public liberty should have vigilant watcli
menâbur its greatefl dangers arise from ihofe
wluj cry IVolj too frequently.
While tliofe who difleininare principles that
have a tendency to make mankind better fathers,
brot hers and citizens, merit more from their coun
try than those who atchieve the most splendid
victoriesâthose 011 the other hand, who by their
wiitings attempt to weaken the bonds of society,
by teaching the principles of a felfifh policy, and
inculcating dodtrines that confound all diftinc
tiotis of right and wrong, are more injurious to
the world than earthquakes which depopulate
whole regions.
While the new constitution was under the con
federation of the people, preparatory to its adop
tion, one of its bitter and pei fevering enemies
was asked, whether he had read a pellicular pub
lication, which was in favor of the initrument ?
His answer was, that he had made up his mind,
and was determined not to trouble hi in lei f with
jading any speculations 011 the (object.âlf per
sons. who at the present day are so zealous and
induflrions in poisoning the public mind, would
adopt a different line of conduct from theabove,

""THE SEAT of the late Dotftor Lewis Johifttn,

ACRES of L AND.
This place is bounded fontherly for near a mile on the r : ver
Raman, where it empties into the bay about 1 Z miles from Sandy*
Hook, and affords two most agreeable fit nations for Grn-lemrns'
Sea's. There are now on it, two brir.k houses, with gardens, and
a good colle&ion of fruit trees of the bell kinds. The land is v ry
fertile, and a great part of it very good meadow ; from its situ
ation on the river, has the advantage of fifh of different kinds, in
their seasons, particularly of oyflers and chicken clams, which may
be picked in great plenty on the flits before the doors. It is a
delightful, healthy situation, capable of genteel and tasty improve
ments ; and as Perth- Ambov is one of the best sea-ports in the
United States, and within 18 miles of the sea, the orofoeft of its
ir.creafing in value from that circumstance, is by no means mcotw
fiderable.
There wil' also be fold, other Lots, w thin the bounds of the
city, and about Five Hundred Acres of Lard on the opposite fide
of thr river Raritanâpart of which is improved bv a farmâon
which there is a framed d weHing-houfe barn, with an orchard
of grafted apple trees, and will contain about one hundred and

ELEVEN ACRES of LAND, adjoining the above, the pro

son's rivets, where thev disembogue into the sea to the Eastâand
a most delightful one of the serpentine courfeof the Raritan river,
for several miles, through a rich tract of meadow to the Weft.
The great quantity of stone neatly dressed, and brick, the remains
of the house lately bum 1, will be nearly fufficient for a new
building; and a large stone cistern, and well of excellent W3trr,
with a very convenient liable and coach-house, will greatly leffea
the expence of putting tHe.place in order for the residence of a
Gentleman.âThere are few situations so eligible, particularly m
the summer seasonâwhen the cool sea breezes, and the elevated
Qfuatfons, render them places of pirating retreat, from the confine
ment and sultry air of the southern states and neighbouringcitics.
