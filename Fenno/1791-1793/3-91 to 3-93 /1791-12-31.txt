[No. 71, of Vol. lII.]
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
MR. FEN NO,
rjj 'HIS day closes another annual measure of
J. time ; ancl happy would be the consequen
ces, if mankind were more disposed to avail them
felvcs of such periods, for the indulgence of re
flection, and a retrofpeitive view of the various
events of life, which, at a diiiance, and diverted
of the falfe colourings that prejudice may have
given them at the time of their occurrence, will
often present a ufeful leltou for future conduct,
and subserve valuable purpofesin societyâmoral
and political.
The critical observer of human affairs, who has
viewed the progress of thole evils to which men
are conltantly exposed by the treachery of the
heart, and the errors of judgment, will be ready
to acknowledge the advantages to be derived â
from a review of former scenes, analyzing the
secret springs to acftion 011 the great drama of
the worldâwith the several causes of success or
disappointment.
If in the course of events we have fetn the
throne of a Despot consuming on the sacred altar
of Libertyâlet Kings, by this, be taught to ve
nerate the rights of menâand to know that the
affeiftions of a free and generous people are the
only fatisfacSory and durable basis of all autho
rity.â If we have observed a Minister facrificed
to the just resentment of his country âlet tliofe
in similar ficuations be careful to lhun the causes
which led to his disgrace, and to cherish ihofe
virtues which will alone ensure them the eftcem
and tonfidence of their fellow-citizens.
If, by the rays of mental light, the wiles of
prieftcrafc have been exposed to view, and we
have seen the pampered sons of luxury deprived
of the wealth they procured by the worst of all
abusesâPriests are hereby taught that ftich pur
suits will not in future avail them, as men will
be no longer led the blind votaries of fuperllitiun
and bigotry
Have vie heard that millions of our fellow men
inagnanimoufly aliening the rights of human
nature) have dared to break the chains which
bound them for ages, and determined to be freeâ
we will indulge the generous emotions of joy,
be stimulated to future exertions in the cause of
liberty, and nourish fair science in our land, as
the source of all social happiness.
If we, on the other hand, have been informed
that thousands have fallen vitfiims to the pride of
royaltyâwhile, with just indignation, we con
template the fad effects which the lust of domina
tion is ever found to produce, let us guard with
cautious eye among ourselves theafpiring efforts
of ambition, and cultivate those sentiments of
philanthropy, which teach men to know and feel
that they are the brethren ofone common family.
Have the bounties of Nature been heaped upon
us with a liberal handâmay gratitude infpii e our
devotions, and our future condudl evidence our
sense of the obligation
If, in the pursuits of private life, fortune has
ieigned to afford us her finilesâlet us, by the
cxercife of genuine benevolence, endeavor to
merit her future favors.
Have we been deprived of fomc of our inoft
valuable friendsâlet us study to copy rliofe vir
tues which procured them elteern, as the best tri
bute due to their memory. MENTOR.

AT THE FESTIVAL OF
ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST.
BY A BROTHER.
YE gracious powers of choral song,
Attend ; inspire your felhve throng;
l.et harmless mirth, and frolic glee,
Dance fportiveat our Jubilee.
We ask no found of spear or ftiield,
No trophes of th' ensanguined field ;
l.et hope, let faith and charity,
Begin and end our Jubilee.
No lavage warrior's scarlet name,
Shall e'er defile our roll of fame ;
Hut peace, with white rob'd train we fee,
Piefiding at our Jubilee.
The heart that feels for widow'd woe.
The tears, for orphans pangs, that flow,
The voicc which bids diflrefs to flee,
Shall celebrate in Jubilee.
Merry, with pearly melting eye,
Stem Jufhcr with her sword on high,
Shall both attendant angels be,
To guide, to guard our Jubilee.
Each Brothei's foul (hall rapturous swell,
Nor furrow toll her lad'ning knell ;
The voice, the hands, the heart bf three,
Shail thrice repeat our Jubilee.
Then call from East to Weft the World,
The mvftic banners are unfurl'd !
And O! departed ancients, fee
From Heaven, and bless oui Jubilee !
Lo ! from his or little (lore,
Each broiher flies his mite to pour,
That men may ft ill rejoice to fee,
A Mason's lodge a Jubilee.
Then (round the circle) let the glass
(Yet in the square) convivial pass ;
And when the fun winds o'er the lea,
Each lafsJhall have her Jubilee.
Be this the general, cordial toast,
(A wish that never should be loft)
That all the world mav Masons be,
And live and love in Jubilee.

" How is this diflioneftyin pecuniary exchang

money they had in circulation was very variable,

prices and payment took place ; but this is now

Description of the curious Bridge at Nifmes, in the
South of France.
THIS bridge to all appearance was conftrudled
b_v t lie Romans. The inortar and Hone with
which it is built, after being.exposed for many
hundred years, have become one cement as hard
as marble. This superb inoilttment of the Ro
mans is composed of three diflindt bridges, .one
above the other : It joins two mountains, tlie
river Gardon palling under itâthe upper bridge
serving as an acqueduift for the paflage of the
little river A'iran. This acquedutft by its wind
ing amongst mountains and rocks is 27 miles
long.
The firft bridge is supported by 6 arches, the
river palling rhrough the sth which is 78 feet
wide. This bridge is 498 feet wide, and 62
high. The second bridge is supported by eleven
arches, being ay feet high and 800 long. The
third bridge is only 24 feet high and 819 long,
being supported by 35 arches.
It is indeed a very curious circumflance to ob
serve two l ivers interfering each otherâthe one
being 151 feet above the other. Indeed by all
the vestiges of the works of the Romans, it seems
their minds and hearts were on a much larger
scale than those of us modern pigmies, who are
afraid to encounter what old Romans would havtf
thought little of. Toall appearance succeeding
ages of Americans, will insensibly regain the
dignified character of Romans. The genius of
our government, and the happy situation of our
country will inevitably lead to this event.
PROVIDENCE, December 17.
Sunday evening last Capt. Brown arrived in
the River from Cape-Francois, which he left the
22d ult. He informs that a party of French
horse had been attacked by the revolted Negroes,
and about 40 of the former killed, which had
given spirits to the blacks ; that the whites
had abandoned Coracole and Jaqnize, and that
ilie former was in flame; Mlien he failed.PARI S, October 9.

hall, they seemed to worftiip the very cliair.
Such an excefsof enthufiaf'tic applause was repro
bated by one of the orftorsâbut his voice was
drowned in the murmurs of the people.âThis
gave great umbrage to M. Goupilleau, one of the
members of the second legislature, who cried out
t hat the majejiy of the peiple was facrtficed to ths
majefly cf the king.â" If you dare to express your

onlyâthat the people are nothing, and the king every
thing. The officer was then called to the bar, and
delired to explain. Three hours were spent in
debating on this insult, and examining witnefles.
The officer at length interpreted his exprellions
into another meaning; and the afl'embly palled
on to the order of the day.
The Directors of the Social-Circle Printing
Press in this city, anxious to contribute all in
their power to the more general dissemination of
that immortal effort of human reason, the New
Conliitution of France, have lately put to press
a polyglott or general translation thereof into
all the languages of Europe. The typographi
cal part is to be executed with the niott scrupu

learning and merit, and entrusted by him into
the hands of such persons as he (hall judge pro

which it is to be transferred. Each translation
will be fold separately. The English will ap

a fortnight. These translations when bound up
into one volume will, it is hoped, become a cJaf

CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
FRIDAY, December 16,1791.
In committee of the whole, on the Pojl-Office Bill.
[Continuation of arguments againil the motion for Itrikins; oul
the hetion which gives the Members ol Coi.grels the privilege of
jrar.klng letters.] fa
\A/HEN the bill under consideration is once
palled into a law, it is prefutnable, that no
gentleman will ever alk a member to frank for
him, as he cannot grant the reqtieft confidently
with his honor:âthe apprehenfion*entertained
of the exillence of abuses, and of their encreaf
mg with the encreafe of numbers, would be an
argument equally valid againtt every law; for
110 law can be so framed, as that people will not
find means to evade it: but still the legislature
will have the power of correrting the abuses, as
loon as discovered, by passing new laws to check
them. Ihe committee, who drafted the bill
had before them all the acfts of the Britifli legis
lature, refpetfting the poft-office : they law The
abuses and how they had been remedied ; and
with such light to guide their steps, they had pro
ceeded 111 the execution of their talk. The pri
vilege of franking they had introduced into the
bill upon mature considerationâto take it awav
would be levelling a deadly llroke at the liberty
oftheprefs : t he information conveyed by franks
may be considered as the vital jaices, and the
â¢channels of rtie poll-office, as the veins; 'and if
these are (topped, the body mull be dellroyed â¢
n is treading on dangerous ground, to take any
measures that may ll op the chancels of public in
formation, efpeeially of that which relates to
matters in which the people are interelled : _ to
check the circulation even of foreign intelligence
may be dangerous ; but it is highly so, to dfprive
the people of information refpetfing the mea
ures of the general government nor ought
he members to complain of being obliged to re-,d
jo many letters and petitions as come to their
hands i n consequence of the exemption f l om po(l .
age. I, any gentleman thought this a heavy
talk, he ought to remember that it was only ],js
f uty, and a talk which every member had under
taken when he accepted a feat in the House
I ne privilege of franking was granted to the
members, not as a personal advantage (for in fact
it P'oved ratner a burden) but as a benefit to their
conftiKients, who, by means of it, derive infor
mat ion from those who are bell qualified to e iv e "
t, as they are the persons chosen to adininiller
crivfufefu ?nf ernM " t ' " lembeis

measures, ought always to be explained 'o infi ,
ential characters in the different p ; . lr:s of ~l ey
nion. Such conduct will produce the molt H
tary effects, in reconciling the people to'the
lures of government, Â« hen the principles up ,
winch every law is framed, are i' u
them, as well by the correi'noiuience ' ,iie
hers, as by their debates, publilhed 111 ih e h.-V l '-
papers. " *
It it the duty of the members to disperse the
newspapers among those people who cannot per
haps otherwise obtain them, than under the pro
tection of franks :âeven along the polt-road,
the common packets of newspapers are not fa' â¢
from depredation : but when once they e et into
the interior parts of the country there is hardly
any chance of their escaping whereas under
cover of a frank, they are sure to reach their def
oliation in fafety.
II the privilege were confined, during the ses
sion, to letters lent from and received at the feat
of government,and the members limited to their
own letters, and obliged to write the whole fupei -
fcription. the encreafe of the apprehended abuses
would be prevented : if it were further reftriift
ed, by limiting it to tliofe letters only that are
lent to or come from the Hate to which the mem
ber belongs, this would convince the peonle, that
the privilege was intended for the benefit not of
the members but of their conflittients.
Further it was observed, that every argument
which might be adduced in favorof withdrawing
the privilege from the members of Con<rrefs
might be used with equal force in t he cases of the
President, Vice-Pi Â«fident, and every other public
officer, mentioned in the fame feftior.. It the al
lowance of fix dollars per day was a reason for
fubji-<sting the members to the payment of poll,
age, every public officer ought also, on the fame
principle, to pay for his letters, as they were all
compenfared with equal liberality. Ifabufes were
apprehended from the members, others were as
likely to introduce them as they : if an encreafe
of revenue was contemplated, the postage of all
letters to and from the Prelident, the Vice-Prefi
denr, the Secretaries of State, of the Trcafury, of
the Department of War, &c. would contributeto
that encreale : â bur 011 the other hand, those geu
tlemen mult have theircompenfations encretffed,
if their letters were to be taxed 1 ; for they could
not be expected to pay for theni at their own ex
pense. if the privilege can be guarded againlt
abuse. with refpetf to thole officers, it can also be
guarded in rhe cafe of members of Congress.
The eftablifhinent of the poll-office is agreed
to be for no other purpose than the conveyance
of information into every parr of the Union j and
a gteater portion of that had been conveyed into
many of the interior parts of the country, by the
newspapers lent by the members of the house,
than could be conveyed by other means, excepting
on the main roads on which flages go: â that in"
foimation had proved highly serviceable to the
prefeut government: ; for wherever the newspa
pers had extended, or even the correspondence
of the members, 110 opposition has been made to
the laws, whereas the contrary was experienced
in those parts to which the information had not
penetrated ; and even there, the opposition
ceased, as soon as the principles on which the
laws had been palled, were made known to the
people.
As as the privilege can be thus used for
thejfctneral advantage of the citizens, it ought
nop to be relinquillied by the members merely
thiongh fear of its being thought a j;erfonal pri
vilege : it inight be confined to members actually
attending the f'ellion ; they might be obliged to
wine the whole fuperfciiprion, and even to add
tie vate. 111 short, the wildoin of the house, it
was hoped, would prevent all the evils appre
hended from it, and retain the advantages.

withdrawing the privilege from the members)

FROM A LONDON PAPER.
VOLTAIRE
AS Voltaire is quoted as the great Oracle of re
publicnnifm (as his ashes are looked upjn
as the embers from which the democracy of France
has been lighted up into its present flame) let us
f-r contra, give, in his own words, what that no
torious atheillical hypocrite has (aid of kings: â
In his celebrated address to the members of the
Academy of Paris, in the year I 746, will be found
these words :
In speaking of Louis the XI Vth. he fays, "Do
you think, gentlemen, that the honors resound
ed by f 0 many voices to the memory of Louis the
XlVih. did not open to tlieinfeves a way 10 the
heart of his fiiccefTor?âlt will one day be said,
that both journeyed to immortality ; lometitnes
by the fame road, sometimes by different routes.
Posterity must fay, that this was the true pursuit
of glory ; that the monarchy of France displayed
a greatness of foul in the happiness of its people !
i hat land and lea gave telfimony of its magnifi
cenceâand the smallest objects, as soon as they
began to have any relation to it, a flu in eel a new
character, and received the it a nip of Sterling
grandeur!"
At the conclusion of this memorable harangue,
we find Voltaire again either a strong royalill, or
the mod profound hypocrite. His words are, in
descanting on the character of the late king of
trance, " We are happy, we have known his
virtues ever since he began to reign. We have
always thought of him, as all ages, and all na
tions will think. Never was there a love more
sincere, or better exprelled : By all hearts it is
felt, and by your eloquent tongue it is declared.
Medals worthy of the most polite times of Greece
eternize his triumphs and our happiness. O !
that I could fee in our public places, fiatues of
that humane monarch carved by the hands of our
Praxiteles's, environed with all the symbols of
public felicity : O ! that 1 cottld read at the foot
of each flattie, these words, which are engraved
upon all our hearts, "To the father of his
country."
After this, what mult the public think of the
admirers of Voltaire ?
FROM THE LONDON CHRONICLE.
THOMSON
One of the most elegant compliments ever paid to this charming
Poet was by a person of his own name, who sent him the fol
lowing Verses :
To Mr. James Thomson, on his Seasons.
HAIL Nature's Poet, whom she taught alone
To sing her works, in numbers like her own,
Sweet as the ihrufh that warbles in the dale,
And foft as Philomela's tender tale;
She lent her pencil too of wond'rous pow'r,
To catch the rainbow, and to form the flow'r,
Of many mingling huesâand smiling said,
(But fir ft with lauiel crown'd her Favourite's head)
" These beauteous Children, tho' so fair they shine,
" Fade in my Scafons; let them live in thine."
And live they (hall, the charm of every eye,
Till Nature ficken,and the Seasons die.
Philadelphia, December 51.
All accounts of the late a<ftion with the Indi
ans refletft honor 011 the condud: of Genera) St.
Clair and his gallant troops. It is true the army
was defeated, but it is highly probable they were
overpowered by superior numbers.âThe annals
of the late war do not exhibit a more lengthy and
severe conflidl; and although the iflue of it was
unfortunate, thereputation of the American arms
remains unimpeached.
Whatever may be the consequences of the In
dian war, the United States are not responsible
for them.âThe predatory incurlions of the Wa
ba(h and Miami Indians, began in the early part
of the late war, and have continued without in
termission to the present time.
These Indians have constantly refufed the in
vitations of the United States to treat .of peace,
although the neighbouring tribes did, at several
periods since the late war, conclude treaties with
us. Some people have supposed that this war
has been lighted up by the encroachments of the
whites.âThis does not appear to be the cafe.â
The VVabafh Indians have not any claim to the
lands within the boundaries by several
treaties with the Western Indians ; ânor have
they urged any such claim : they appear to have
been incited to a continuance of their depreda
tions, by a thirst for blood and plunder, with both
of which they have been but too abundantlj gra
tified.
When the insolence and criu-liies of these ban
ditti (hall be fully explained to the public, toge
ther with the means used to bring them to a just
f'enfe of their situation, without having recouiTe
to the last extremity, the humanity of the United
States will be abundantly apparent, and their con
duct receive, as it merits, the approbation of the
enlightened part of mankind.

_ A veflel arrived at Boftoti brings a corjfmna
ioy erf the deftruiftion of Port-au-Prince.
Port-au Prince was a large and populous city,
containing more than 20,000 inhabitantsâlt is
now an heap of rubbifii and its citizens reduced
to indeferibable distress.
We can inform our readers from the best au
thority, thai in the late aiftion of the 4th of No
vember, under Major-General St. Clair, the fol
lowii'g gallant conduct of Major Butlei , brother
to the late General Butler who commanded one
of the battalions of levies from this state, took
placeâthe Major having received the wound
which broke his leg, he retired to be drefled, and
the moment it was over, got himfelf put upon a
horse, and returned to his battalion, and conti
nued with it until it was ordered to retire.

open for fifteen days, agreeable to law, were
doled on Saturday last, when it appeared that
there were 40,000 shares fubferibed, being 39,000
shares more than the law requires, the whole
number is to be reduced down to one thousand

The committee of the House of Representatives

Late letters from Jamaica to a gentleman in this city, mention
that the Ipirit of revolt among the negroes had at length reached
the ifljnd âthat the white inhabitants were fincerel/ alarmed for
their falety, had proclaimed martial law, and were taking every
precaution in their power to prevent a general infur*6tiou. The
flame is spreading, and threatens the Weft-India islands with ruin
and devastation.
Wednesday lad the Senate of this Commonwealth, voted that
the choice of a Federal Senator fliould be by a concurrent vote
11, to 6.
The amnesty, allowed in France to the fugitive princes, and
others who have opposed the revolution, is very honoiable, as-well
as wife and politic. Men overturn a tyranny, because they fear
it ; and what they fear they hate. The druggie for liberty in
flames both passions, fear and hatred. The moment of triumph
is a dangerous trial of the heart; for it finds the latter palfion
thii sting for the deftruÂ£tion of the obje&s and persons, which it
lately feared and continues to hale. The amnesty evinces the
magnanimous confidence of the National AlTembly in the liabili
ty of their own work ; no longrr fearing their foes, they have the
nobleness of foul, as well as wisdom, to forgive them. It is to
the honor of the age that opinions are no longer punilhed as
crimes. Go on, enlightened Frenchmen, your mildness (a nation
al virtue now resumed) in the use of your privileges, will make
liberty appear amiable in the eyes of other nations.
Hitherto a free people have been considered as a kind of fcc
taries ; it bas been a diftin&ion in the world, and a proud one
too of more worth than all its titles. But the time is coming,
and the French, il they are wife and prudent enough to make
their work strong as they do it, will hasten the period, when the
major vote of the world will be given in favor of libertyâwhen
the want, or the loss of it, will be considered as a stain, a mark of
ignominy and degradation, which slaves, the most uled to it, will
not have the patience to carry.
The example of a free people is important to the world. The
common objection against free governments, is, that they run into
licentiousness. Afi ce people, therefore, by refuting obedience
to the laws, do an injury not only to themselves, but to mankind.
It is not kings only who are terrified by feeing the effects of this
disobedienceâ it seems, in their view of the matter, a duty with
men of sense and virtue, living in countries whose governments
need reforming, to oppose the work of reformation, and to pre
serve the public trjoquility, even at the piiceol delaying, perhaps
of finally losing the opportunity of changing things for the belter.
How would itaifcourage the European lovers of liberty and good
order, for they are the fame fort of men, to find that we in Ame
rica have made a new form of government, as free as the air, and
one that has been found as good to dispute about as ever was
made ; but the people will not obey it. Surely then no Ameri
can who is h;ilf as proud of his country and his liberty as he has
caufeto be, will give occasion for his own and his country's dis
honor, by opposing or countera&ing the excise laws. There is no
liberty without government âand surely there is no government
where men govern the laws* Men may love liberty in their hearts
who join in the cry against the exciseâbut if they are wild e
nough to oopofe it foicibly, they are the worst enemies of liberty.
â¢ excise has a bad nameâbut never was more pains bellow
ed to ma.ke the aÂ£l deserve a good one. Will not the men who
think it a dangerous law, give those who would explain it an hear
ing ? Will they not fee the effects of the law before they pro
nounce it oppreflive ? It is to be feared that great misrepresenta
tions have taken place. But the truth, though flow, will arrive at
last, and thousands will be surprised to find how grossly they have
been imposed upon, in relation to this obnoxious law.
With so much good sense as our countrymen arc known to
possess ; and after so much as they have done and fuffered to esta
blish an equal government, by laws and not by men, it is lmpof
fible to conccive that an\ men, uniefs in a fit of mad paflion, can
be found so wickcd and foolilh as to fly in the face of authority,
and to oppose those very laws which they, by their representatives,
have had pait in framing.

ADDRESS
TO THE CITIZENS OF
WESTMORELAND, WASHINGTON, FAYETTE AND
ALLEGHANY COUNTIES.
REVENUE LAW
By JOHN NEVILLE, Inspector op the Revenue,
Survey No. 4, District Pennsylvania
AS far as any discretionary power of visiting is given to any
officcr acting under that law, it is confined to buildincs,
which are enter ed by the parties, as places in which they ear
ly on the business of di&tilling. No other house or build
iug they may have can be visited. If there arc even particular
apartments in a house in which the bufincfs is carricd on,
these only, if designated properly, can be viiited by the officer.
He would have no right to meddle with any other apartment in
the house.
Thus careful have Congiefs been to secure and protest the ci
tizen from any improper intrusion or learch.
But even this very qualified power of visiting is confined to Dis
tilleries from Foreign Materials, and to distilleries from domeltic
materials in Cities, Towns and Villages only. It does not at al!
apply to any cafe, in which the duty is charged upon the Still it
felf, whether the party chooses to pay the sixty cents per gallon
of the capacity of the still, or the nine cents per gallon on the spi
rits aftualJy distilled by him. In which ever way he may make
his cle&ion, he is free from the visitation of the officer; this, it is
believed, has escaped your notice, as it appeart to my mind to ob
viate many of the prevalent obje&ions.
The power of visiting the still to take its dimensions, once for
all, will hardly be deemed an exception to what is here a tier ted.
This would be nothing more than if Affeflbrs were to come upon
a man's farm to view the size, the kinds and quality of the land.
Neither can the provision which authorises inagiftrates in cer
tain cases to grant search warrants be deemed an exception, Hcie
the discretion is not in the officer of the revenue, but in the Ma
giftratr, and even he cannot grant such a warrant, but in conse
quence of reasonable cause of suspicion made out to his fatisfac
tion upon oath, nor can the warrant granted be executed bur in
the prefeuce of a conilable or other pcace officcr.
This power of searching so much complained of, is however
not peculiar to excise laws. Ships, which are certainly much
more the dwellings of the master and the crew, than are the great
est numbers ol distilleries, are liable to constant search, and as
far as search warrants are concerned, a similar power is to be
found in the law regulating the collection of the duties on im
ported articles, which is not only a neceifai y provision, but one
which has never exeited the least murmur among the merchants,
or others whose houses or (lore houses might be atfefted by ir.
By the laws of Pcnnfylvania too, all bakehouses may be enter
ed and examined by certain public officers at their discretion;
and they are almost uniformly a part of the dwellings of trie per
lons who condutt them ; whereas distilleries in molt cases form
no part of the dwellings of their owners, any more than a saw
mill or a smith shop. This regulation has always been ftiiflly
executed in the city of Philadelphia, bciug confidcicd as one of
the most important in its police.
No one of these things has been deemed an invasion of domeft c
pcace or private propeity. As well might it be said that the en
try of an aflcfror to levy, or of a tax gatherei to demand and en
force the payment of a tax is such an invasion. Ideas of this fort
are certainly overstrained, and are incompatible with the neces
sary operations of the mildest of governments.
Third objection. " The oaths which are required of the par
ties tend to injure morals and multiply temptations to peijury."
Anfwcr. It is ccitainly always to be wished that a multiplica
tion of oaths could be avoided, but the requiring them is not an
objection to excise laws in particular. It applies to fcveral other
kind of revenue laws, and it is much easier to wish they could be
avoided, than to discern how it can be done with due fccurity to
the public.
No article fubjefl to a duty on importation can be brought into
the country, but the master of the veflel mull, in the firft pla;e
report it on oath ; and before it can be landed the owner or con
signee mull also enter it upon oath, producing an invoice of the
article, its cost, See. Similar regulations are pra6ticed in foreign
countries, and were prafliced under all the State governments ;
nor has there ever been any reasonable fubftitutc proposed. If
neither the iufpeflion of officers, nor the oaths of parties arc to
be tolerated, there is no alternative, but that all taxes must be laid
upon land, oraflTefled according to the arbitrary guesses of cciuin
officers. The former would ruin the farmer and disappoint the
revenue : the latter truly involves the word kind of tyranny, arid
is equally unprodu&ivc to the treasury.
<4 Foorth objection. The penalties and forfeitures in the law
? rC high as not only to puniffi, but ruin delinquents, who
bear in their fufferings the delinquency ot otheis.",
Answer. Tlie penalties and lorfeiturrsare not higher nor more
Severe, than those which secure the collection of dunes on import
ed articles and the regulations of the coasting trade, and are not
greater than are usual in revenue laws generally. Pecuniary pen
allies in forne cases extend from one to five hundred dollars and
forfeiture ol the article itfclf, in refpeft to which attempts'have
been made to defraud the public, are the only pur.ilhmeia to be
found in the excise law, except for falfe oaths and extortion or
oppreffian on the part of the officers. False oaths involve the
pains of perjury ; the extortion or oppression ot officers brines
with it fines imprisonments, forfeiture ol office, and an incapacity
to nolo offices in future. r '
