*lU of loan-office certificates issued between the fir ft of Septem

nominal lum. Many of the holders of this species of debt have
come in upon the terms of the ast, but others have hitherto de
c.inea it ; /Hedging, that the special nature of their contract gives
a peculiarity to their cafe, and renders the commutation propo
not 10 fair an equivalent to them, as in other instances. They

ar g*d. This certainly renders their contraÂ£l of a nature more
eneficial than ihat of other creditors ; but they are at the fame
time liable to be diverted of the extra-benefit it gives the n, by a
payment of their specie-dues ; and it may beobferved, that they

were enabled to reahfe, advantages superior to other creditors.

It does not therefore appear to have been an unreasonable ex

t at the accommodation deftred was confident with the best in

â¢em raced the proportion. It is probable, that the progreji of
t lings will (atisfy the remainder, that it is equally their interest to

surrender of the old certificates for new ones importing a eontraft
lubftantially different, appears to the S-cretarv not destitute of
foundation. He presumes, that the operation of that provision,
in the particular cafe was not adverted to ; or, that an exception
would have heen introduced as mod consonant with the general
Ipirit and defignof the act. Accordingly the farther measures
which will be submitted, will contemplate a method of obviating
the objection in question.
From the confutation, that an extension of the time for re
ceiving fubferiptions udoii the terms of the ast making provision
or ihe debt of the United States, isdefired by a large proportion
ot the non-fubferibnig creditors; and from the farther confider
at ion, that lufficient experience has not yet been had of the pro
dutfcivenefs ot a considerable branch of the revenues which have
been eftabliQied, to afford the light necessary to the final arrange
mentâit is, in the judgment of the Secretary, advifeable, tore
new the piopofition for a loan in the domestic debt, on the fame
terms with the one which has been closed, and to allow time for
receiving fubferiptions to if unuJ'the last day of September next,
inclulively ; making provision tor the temporary payment of in
terest to such who may not think fit to subscribe, tor the year
1 79 2 > of the like nature with that which was made in the fame
cafe tor the year 1791 âexcept as to the holders of loan-office cer
tificates, issued between the firft of September, 1777, and the firft
of March, 1778 ; in refpeft to whom it is submitted as proper to
drfpenfe with the obligation of exchanging their old certificates
for new. as the condition of their receiving interest in capacity of
non-fubferibers ; and to allow them, w'.thout such exchange, to
receive the fame interest, both for the years 1791 and 1792, as if
they had fubferibed to the firft loan. It will not be materially
difficult, so to regulate the operation at the treasury as to avoid in
the particular cafe, that danger of imposition by counterfeits,
which was the motive to thegeneral provision for an exchange of
certificates.
11. The amount of the fubferiptions in the debts of the ref
pe&ive States, within the limits of the sum aflumed in each, ap
pears by the ftatrment marked D. to be dollars 17,072,334.
39-ioodths, fubjeft to the observations accompanying that llaie
ment. Consequently the difference between th aggregate of the
sums fubferibed and the aggregate of the sums aflumed, in dollars
45427,665. 61-ioodtbs.
7.088,727. 79
This difference is to be attributed to several causes, the princi
pal of which are the following : First, That the sums afTumed in
l efpeel to certain States exceeded the a&ual amount of their ex
iting debts. Second, That in various instances, a part of the ex
iting debt was in a form which excluded it from being received,
without contravening paiticular provisions of the law ; as in the
cafe of certificates iffucd alter the firft day of January, 1790, in
lieu of certificates which had been iflued prior to that period,
wnich was reported upon by the Secretary on the twenty-fifth day
of February last. Third, Ignorance of, or inattention to the li
mitation of time for receiving fubferiptions. It appears, that a
number of persons loft the opportunity of fubferibing from the
one oÂ» the other of these causes.
1 >Â«3'>3 6 4- 76
A ftrongdefire that a farther opportunity maybe afforded for
fubferiptions in the debts of the States, has been manifefted by
the individuals interested. And the States of Rhode-Island and
New-Hampshire, have by the public a6ls referred to the Secretary,
indicated a fiinilar desire. The affording of such farther opportu
nity, may either be reftri&ed within the limit, as to amount,
which is contemplated by the ast itfelf, or may receive an exten
sion which will embrace the residuary debts of the States.
1 he firft may be considered as nothing more than giving full
effect to a measure already adopted.
1 he last appears to have in its favor all the leading inducements
to what has been already done. The embarrafTments which
might arise from confli&ing systems of finance, are not entirely
obviated. The efficacious command of the national resources for
national exigencies, is not unequivocally secured. Theequalizing
of the condition of the citizens of every (late, and exonerating
those of the states mod indebted, from partial burthens which
would press upon them in consequence of exertions iu a common
cause, is not completely fulfilled, until the entire debt of every
state, contracted in relation to the w*r, is embraced on one gene
ral and comprehensive plan. The inconvenience to the United
States, of difbui thening the states 4 which arc still encumbered with
considerable debts, would bear no proportion to the inconveni
ence which they would feel, if left to struggle with those debts,
unaided.
15 674. 62
107,648. 63
More general contentment, therefore, in the public mind, may
be expected to attend such an exoneration, than the reveife; in
proportion as the experience of actual inconvenience would be
greatei, though only applicable to parts, in the one than in the
other cafe.
With regard to states, parts only of the debts of which have
been aflTumed, and in proportions ftiort of those, which have pre
vailed, in favor of other states, and short also of what would have
resulted from a due apportionment of the entire sum afTumed ; the
claim to a further aflumption is founded on confederations of
equal justice, as relative to the meafuie itfelf, considered in a se
parate and independent light.
But there is a further reason of material weight for an immedi
ate general assumption. Mpnicd men, as well foreigners as citi
zens, through the expeftatibn of an eventual aflumption, or that in
some shape or other a substantial provision will be made for the
unaflutned residue of the state debts, will be induced to speculate
in the purchase of them. In proportion as the event is unfeitled,
or uncertain, the price of the article will be low, and the present
proprietors will be under disadvantage in the sale. The joss to
them in favor of the purchasers is to be regarded as an evil; and
as far as it is conne&cd with a transfer to foreigners, at an under
value, it will be a national evil. By whatever authority an ulti
mate provision may be made, there will be an absolute loss to the
community eqnal to the amount of such under-value.
It may appear an obje&ion to the measure, that it will require
an establishment of additional funds by the government ot the
United States. But this does not seem to be a necelfary confc
quence. The piobability is, that without a fupplementarv as
sumption, an equal, or very nearly equal augmentation of funds
will be rcquifite to provide for greater balances in lavor of certain
dates, which would be proportionally duninifhed by such af
umption. The destination, not the quantum of the fund, will
therefore be the chief diftin&ion between the two cases.
It may also appear an objection to a total aflumption, that the
magnitude of the object is net ascertained with precision. It is
not certainly known, what sum is due in each state ; nor has it
been poflible to acquire the information, owing to different causes.
But though precise data are deficient, there arc materials which
will serve as guides. From the, returns received at the trcafury,

I a (lifted by information in oilier ways, it miv he ftited without

I over and above the funis already fubferibed, will not exceed the
amount, fpecfied in the Bate,nent D. acro.npauyi.ig this report-
And that, including the sums already fubferibed, thelotal amount

will not exceed dols. 25,403,362. 71 which would couftitute an
addition of dols 3,903,36*. 71 to the Aim of 5i,500,000 dollar*,
already aliumed.
./{-Id Â» total assumption be deemed eligible, it may still be
advifeable to alfign a determinate sum for each state, that the uc
molt limit of the operation may be pre-eftablilhed ; and it is nt
celiary ,n order to the certainty of a due provision in prop-r time
ul'aff re AÂ° U i', d r r Ã '" * on the .Jdfi
lums ailumec}, till after the year 1792.
It will occur, that provision has been made, for paying to each
state, m trull for ,u non-fubicrib.ng creditors, an interest u P on the
difference between the sum..(Filmed (or such fta.e, and that aftu
been fubfenbed ' 'Â° WhSt W Â° uM h ' VC bcen T a y ,b 'e> if it had
j" ' h n 'wrll 1 Â°f ' fanhcr "Gumption, either within the limits al
ready eltabhlhed, or commensurate with the remaining deb's of
the states; It IS conceived, that it will not be incompatible with
the provilion just mentioned, to retain, at the end ot each quarter
during the progress of the farther fubfer, pt.on, out of the money
d.rested to be paid to each state, ihe sum corresponding with the
interest upon so much ol its debts as {hall have been fubferibed to
that period, paying the overplus it any, to the state. An abfo.
lute (ufpenfion of that payment does not appear confident with
the nature of the ftipulatior., included in that provision ; for though
the money to be paid to a state be expr.fsly a trull for the non.
uotcriblng creditors ; yet as it cannot be certain beforehand, that
they will cleft to change their condition, the possibility of it will
not juilify a lufpenfion of payment to the state, which might opc.
rate as a suspension of payment to the creditors themselves.
A farther objeaion to such a suspension results from the idea,
'hat the provision in question appears to have a secondary obje6l;
namely, as a p edge for fecurin; a provision for whatever balance
may be found due to a state on the general fettlemenL of accounts.
The payment direded to be made to a state, is, " to continue until
there Ihall be a fettlemcnt of accounts between the Uni:ed States
and the individual ftdtcs ; and in cafe a balance Ihould then appear
in favor of a state, until provision (hall be made for the said ba
lance."
This secondary operation as a pledge or security (confidently
with the intent of the funding ast) can only b.: superseded in fa
vor of the primary objedf, a provision for the creditors ; and as far as
may be necessary to admit thorn to an etf;dual participation or
it. But as whatever money may be paid to a state, is to be paid
over to its creditors, proportional deductions may, with proprie
ty, be made from the debts of those creditors who may hweafier
lubfcribe; so as that the United States may not have to pay twice
for the fdine purpose.
If it (hall be judged expedient, either to open again, or extend
the aflumption, it will be necefTary to vary the dcfcriptinn of the
debts, which may be lubfcribed, so as to comprehend all those,
which have relation to services or supplies during the war, under
such refttiftions as arc requtfite to guaid against abuse.
In the original proposition for an assumption of the (late debts,
and in the suggestions now made on ibc fame fubjeii, the Sccie
taty has contemplated, aod still contemplates, as a material part
of the plan, an cffr&ual proviflon for the ! ;of the vacant lands
of the United States. He has considered tbn refourci-, as all im
portant mean of finking a part of the debt, and facilitating ulti,
mate arrangements concerning the residue. If fupplementarjr
funds (hall be rendered necessary, by an additional aflfiini|jtion #
the provilion will most conveniently be made at the next feflW
of Congress, when the produftivenefsof the exilling revenues, and
the exicnt of the sum to be provided for, will be better ascer
tained.
There is a part of the public debt of the United States, which
is a cause of some perplexity to the treasury. It is not compre
hended within the existing provision for the foreign debt which
is confined to loans made abroad ; and it is queftiouable, whether
it is to be regarded as a portion of the domcftic debt. It is not
only due lojoreignerj, but the interest upon it is payable, by ex
press stipulation, in a foreign country ; whence it becomes a mat
ter of doubt, whether it be at all contemplated by the ad making
provision for the debt of the United States. The part alluded to, ,
is that which is due to certain foreign officers who served the
United States during the late war. In consequence of a resolution
of Congress, directing their inter ft to be paid to them in France,
the ceitificates which were issued to them fpecify, that " in pur
suance of and compliance with a certain resolution of Congress of
the third day of February, 1784, the laid inteieft is to be paid, an
nually, at the house of Monf. lc\Grand, banker in Paris." Interest
has accoidinglv been paid to them at Pans, down to the 31 ft of
December, 1788, by virtue of a special resolution of Congress of
the 20th of August in that year, fmce which period, no payment
has been made.
It has been heretofore suggested as the op : nion of the Secretary,
that it would be expedient to cause the whole of this dcfcriptioa
of debt to be paid off; among other ieafons, because it bears an
inteieft at fix per centum per annum, payable abroad, and can be
discharged with a saving. The other reasons alluded to are of a
nature both weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is presumed,
to need a fpecification. Some recent circumftanccs have served to
strengthen the inducements to the m afure. But if it should,
finally, be deemed unadvifeable, it is necessary, at least, that pro*
vision (hould be made for the interest, wh ch is now suspended,
under the doubt that has been stated, and from the want of autho
rity to remit it pursuant to the contra#.
The amount of this debt, with the arrears of intcreft to the end
of the year 1791, is dols. 220,646. 81.
IV. The ad making provision for trie debt of tho United States,
has ;Â«ppropria'ed the proceeds of the western lands as a fund for
the discharge of the public debt. And the aÂ£fc making provifioa
ior ttie redu&ion ot the public debt, has appropriated all the sur
plus of the duties on imports and tonnage, to the eÂ»rd of the year
1790, to the purpose of purchasing the debt at the market price,
and has authorjfed the President to borrow the further sum ot
two millions of dollars tor the fame objefct. >
These measures f:rve to indicate the intention of the legiflaturc,
as early and as fait as to provide for the cxtinguilhroent
of the existing debt.
In puriuatice of 1 hat intention, it appears advifeable, that a sys
tematic plan should be begun for the creation Â«nd eftabhflimeot
a finking fund.

PHILADELPHIA
IiOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
MONDAY, February 6.
In committee of the, whole, on the F-ijhery Bill.
[CONTI N U ED.*]
MR. MADISON. In the conflict I feel be
. tween my disposition on one hand to afford
every constitutional encouragement to the fiifhe
ries, and niy diflrke on the other, of the conse
quences apprehended from some clauses in the
bill, I should have forborne to enter into this
if 1 had not found that over and above,
such arguments as appear to be natural and per
tinent to the fubje<ft, others have been introduc
ed, which are in my judgment, contrary to the
true meaning, and even ltrike at the 'chara<fter
iftic principles the exiftihg constitution. Let
me premise however to the remarks which I shall
briefly offer, on the do<ftrine maintained by these
gentlemen,,that I make a material diiiindtion in
theprefent cafe, between anallowanceas a mere,
commutation and modification of a drawback,
and an allowance in the nature of a real and po
sitive bounty. I make a diftincftion also, as a
of fair consideration, at least, between a
bounty granted under the particular terms in the
constitution, " a power to regulate trade," and
one granted under the indefinite terms, which
have been cited as authority on this occasion.
I think however that N the term " bounty" is in
every point of view improper as it is here appli
ed, not only beeaufe it may be offenfive to some,
and in the opinion of others, carries a dangerous
implication ; -but also because it does not express !
the true intention of thÂ«r bill as avowed and ad
vocated by its patrons themselves. For if in the
.allowance nothing more is proposed than a mere
reimbursement of the sum advanced, it is only
paying a debt ; and when we pay a debt, we
ought not to claim themerit of granting a bounty.
It is supposed by some gentlemen, that Con
greft have authority not only to grant bounties
in the ferife here used, merely as a commutation
for drawbacks ; but even to grant them under a
power by virtue of which they may do any thing
â which they may think conducive to the " gene
ral welfare." This, Sir, in my mind raises the
important and fundamental question ; whether
the general terms which have been cited, are to
be considered as a fort of caption or general de
scription of the fpecified powers, and as having
no further meaning, and giving no further pow
er, than what is found in that fpecification, or
as an abftradt an-1 indefinite.delegation of pow
er extending to all cases whatever ; to all
at least as will admit the application of money,
which is giving as much latitude as any govern
ment could well desire.
J, Sir, haÂ«e always conceived, âI believe those
who proposed t ihe constitution conceived, and it is
still niore stilly known, and more material toob
ferve, t{iat those who ratified the constitution
conceived, that this is not an indefinite govern
ment, deriving its powers from thegeneral terms
prefixed to the fpecified powers, but a limitted
government, tied down- to the fpecified powers,
which explain and define the general terms.
The gentlemen who contend for a contrary
doctrine are surely not aware of the consequenc
es which flow from it, and which they mull ei
ther admit or give up their do<ftrine.
It will follow in the firft place that if theterms
be taken in the broad sense they maintain, the
particular powers afterwards so carefully and
cliftinÂ«ftly enumerated would be without mean
ing, and tn nit go for nothing. It would be ab
find to fay firft, that Congress may dowhatthev
please, and then that they may'do this or that
particular thing ; after giving Congress power
to ra'rfe money and apply it to all put pofcs which
they may pronounce neceflary to the general wel
fare, it would be absurd, to fay the least, fuper
add a power to raise armies, to provide fleets,
&c. In fact t' t meaning of the general terms in
question niuft either be fought in the subsequent
enumeration which limits and details them ; or
they convert the government from one limitted
as hitherto supposed, to the enumerated powers,
into a government without any limits at all.
lt is to be recollected that tht terms " common
defence and general welfare" as here used, are
not novel terms fir ft introduced into this confti
tution. They are terms familiar in their con
ftrti&ion and well known to the people of Ame
rica.
They are repeatedly found in the old articles
of confederation, where altho they are fufcepti
ble of as great latitude as can be given theip by
the context here, it was never supposed or pre-
ended tliat they conveyed any such power as is
now assigned to them. On the contrary, it was
always cotifidered as clear and certain, that the
old Congress was limitted to the enumerated
powers ; and that the enumeration limitted and
explained the general terms. I alk the gentle
men themselves whether it ever was supposed or
ufpetfted that the old Congress could give away
lie monies of che dates in bounties, to encou-
rage agriculture, or for any other purpose they
plea fed. If such a power had been pofTelTed by
that body, it would have been much less impo
tent, or have borne a very different character
from that universally ascribed to it.
The novel idea now annexed to these terms,
Sand never before entertained by the friends or
enemies of the government, will have a further
consequence which cannot have been taken into
the view of the gentlemen. Their conftrudtion
would not only give Congress the compleat legis
lative power 1 have dated : it would do more ;
it would fupercede all the reftricftions understood
at present to lie on their power with reipedt to
the judiciary. It would put it in the power of
Congress to establish courts throughout the Unit
ed States, with cognizance of suits between citi
zen and citizen, and in all cases whatsoever.
This, Sir, seems to be demonstrable : for if the
clause in question really authorises Congress to
do whatever they think fit, provided it be for the
general welfare, of which they are to judge, and
money can be applied to it, Congress mull have
power to create and support a judiciary establish
ment, with a jurifdidliori extending to all cases
favorable in their opinion tothe general welfare,
in the fame manner as they have power to pais
laws and apply money, providing in any other
way for the general welfareâl lhall be remind
ed perhaps, that according to the terms of the
constitution the judicial power is to extend to cer
tain cases only, not to a'l cases. But this circurn
{tance can have no effect in the argument, it be
ing presupposed by the gentlemen that the fpe
cification of certain obje>fts does not limit the im
port of general terms. Taking these terms as
an abrtratfl and indefinite grant of power, they
comprize all the objects of legislative regulation,
as well such as fall under the judiciary article
in the constitution, as those falling immediately
under the legislative article ; and if the partial
enumeration of objecfts in the legislative article
does not, as these gentlemen contend, limit the
general power, neither will it be limitted by the
partial enumeration of objeifts in the judiciary
article.
There are consequences, Sir, still more
five, which, as they follow clearly from the doc
trine combated, mull either be admitted, or the
dotflrine must be given up. If Congress cin ap
ply money indefinitely to the general welfare,
and are the sole and (upreme judges of thegene
ral welfare, they may take the care of religion
into their own hands ; they may eftabli/li teach
ers in every state, county, and parifli, and pay
them out of the public treasury ; they may take
into their own hands the education of children,
establishing in like manner schools throughout
the union ; they may undertake the regulation
of all roads, other than pod roads : in short, eve
ry thing, from the higbeft objedl of state legisla
tion. down to the molt minute objecft of police,
would be throwri under the power of Congress ;
for every objecft I have mentioned would admit
the application of money, arid might be called,
if Congress pleased, provisions for the general
welfare.
The language held in various difcuflions of
this house, is a proof that the dodtrine in questi
on was never entertained by this body. Argu
ments, wherever the fubjedt would permit, have
constantly been drawn from the peculiar nature
of this government as limitted to certain enume
rated powers, instead of extending, like other
governments, to all cases not particularly except
ed. In a very late instance, 1 mean the debate
on the representation bill, it must be remember
ed, that an argument much urged, particularly
by a gentleman from Mafl'achufetts, againii the
atio of one for 30,000, was t hat this government
was unlike the state governments, which had an
ndefinite variety of objects vmhin their power,
that it had a fina.ll number of objects only to at
tend to, and therefore that a smaller number of
reprefencatives would be fufficient to administer
it.
Several arguments have been advanced rofhew
that becaiife, in tlie regulation of trade, indirect
and eventual encouragement is given to manu
factures, therefore Congress have power to give
money in direct bounties, or to grant it in any
other way that would answer the fame purpose :
But finely, Sir, there is a grea: and obvious dif
ference which it cannot be necessary to enlarge
upon. A duty laid on imported implements of
husbandry, would in its operation be an indirect
tax on exported prod.uce ; but will any one fay,
that by virtue of a mere power to lay duties on
imports, Congress might go dire<Ttlv to the pro
duce or implements of agriculture, or to the ar
ticles exported. It is true, duties on exports are
expressly prohibited ; but if there were no arti
358
ele forbidding them a power directly to tax e>t.
port's could nev-r be deduced from a power t 0
tax imports, although such a power might direct
ly and iricidently affect exports
In fhorc, Sir, without'going farther into the,!
fubje*Tt, which I should not have here touched |
at all but for the reasons already mentioned..^*Â®
I venture to declare it as my opinio.n, that were
power of Congress tobe established in the
contended for, it would subvert the very
on, and tranfinute the very natiure of the limit-â *!
ted government eftablilheil by the people of
rica : â and what inferences might be diavrn or<Jl
what consequences ensue from such a step,
incumbent on us all well to consider. * '/*i
With refpetft to rhe question before the Houiy -t
for linking out the clause, it is immaterial whe
ther it be ltruck out, or so amended as to reft""
on the avowed principle of a commutation sos '>
the drawback ; but as a clause has been drawn
up by my colleague, in order to be i'ubltituted- v
1 ftiall concur in a vote for ilriking out, referv. '
ing to iriyfelf a freedom to be governed in my '
final vote by the modification which may prey ay/
Mr. Bourne (MaflT.) âMr. Chairman, I think
little can be added after so full a difcuffionof the -
fubje<fc before you. The'objecft of the firft fedioa
in this bill, is intended for the relief of the 6ft- â 
ermen and their owners; they complain that the
law now in force was meant for their benefit, by
granting a drawback on the filh exported; thii '
they find by experience is not the cafeâforthey
fay that neither the fifhermen who catch thefift, '
or the importer of the fait, receives the
back ; and I rather fuppbfe, Sir, it is the cafe
The owners of ths greater part of the fifhing ves
sels are npt merchants, neither do they import
the fait they confunie ; but when the filh they
take are cured for market, they are fold at the
market price ; and it frequently happens, that
those persons who purchase the fifli, are not the
exporters of them, or the importers of the fait â
but a third person, whopurchafes with aprofpect
of felling them at a profit, is the exporter; and
when it so happens, neither the fifherman who
catches the filh, or the importer of the fait, re
ceives any benefit from the drawback, unless the
purchaser (the third person) gives a greater price
in contemplation of the drawback, which I think
is not to be supposed.
Is it worthy the attention of government that
the cod fifhery lhould be preferved?âlt appears
to me that it is. When we consider the labour
and afliduity bellowed 011 this object by our rci
nifters, at the fettle'ment of peace between us and
Great-Britain, and the care then taken to secure
this privilege, as appears by the treaty [He r c
Mr. Bourne read that part of the treaty which
secures to us the fifhery, he then proceeded] and
consider the struggle made to deprive us of this
inestimable branch of commerce, I cannot sup
pose that any one would at this day voluntarily
relinquish it, and fuffer Great-Britain to mono
polize thissbranch, and fnpply the Mediterranean,
.French, and other markets. Great-Britain, at
present, enjoys a fufficient portion of this com
merce, while France is confined to the narrow li
mits of St. Peters and Miquelon. If we relin
quish this branch of" the cod filhery, what is left
us > âOur whale fiiliery is nearly at an end, and
unless government fpeedilv inrerpofes by grant
ing relief, we shall totally lose i . â Does not the
Briiifh government wifti to deprive us of this
branch also ? have not letters or agents been sent
to, the iflind of tyantucket, as well as New-Bee
ford, where this branch of bufinef* is principally
prosecuted, inviting the whale fifhermen 10 re
move,.and offering them permanent fettlemenu
at Milford-Haven, at the expcnce of their go
vernment ?âThis mtift be viewed as a great en
couragement, in addition to their bounties on 01.
to a class of poor men employed in thatbufine s.
If the cod fifhery is relinquished, the filhermen
have only to remove to theoppofitefhoreof Jâ¢

lam for government, and here is my plan. I
have followed naturp, ai}d that sense which na
ture has implan ted in every mail. I would have
a government, but it should not govern meâthat
is my fir ft article. My second is, I would govern
itv And thirdly, I and .my government would
govern every .body else according tomy pleafnre.
Here is a plan of three parts, as it (l)ould be and
which follows i.ature ; whereas every other
scheme thwarts it, and may be truly said to be
against nature. lam clear again it an Excise,
therefore I would not submit my property to any
aut-hority.âAs to my person, hands off. Ami
to be dragged about in the militia ? or in the
wars ? or to answer mycreditors (worfethan In
dians) in the law courts ? No. lam a freeman
âand shall government, a creature I have made
and pulled to pieces twenty times, lord it over
nie ? No, Meflieurs Printers, I give the world
notice that I will fill the full till go
vernment h'aul in its horns, knd regulate its mea
sures by my three articles of natural law. I will
rail against the debtâthe armyâthe warâthe
bank-âthe Exciseâthe P Iâthe heads of de
apartments. I will cry out re-pobli-can-ifm and
the rights of man, by which 1 dont mean the iaivs%f
the land, nor equal government ; but a govern
ment agreeable to my three articles. 1 will hold
forth loudly about republican virtue and equa
lityâl will inveigh mightily against public faith
â when I am tired of going on foot I will get up
and ride on consolidation. The state govern
ments shall be so wife, so pure, so free, so modest
.and so much in danger, that I will advise the
small states to take away power from Congress
and give it to the large states. Congress and the
public officers shall be painted like devils, except
there should be fotlnd any of them who are among
us who write in the newspapers, like Caius, &c.
these I will praise in poetry and prose. In my

of my heroes are celebrated, to the tune of Oh
my kitty, my deary. WHISKY.
Philadelphia, March 7.
ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS,
It is hardly poflible to conceive that a more
favorable opportunity than the pre fen t will ever
occur of eftablilhing free schools in this com
monwealth. The public Treasury is full and
flowing; j so that pecuniary aid can be immedi
ately afforded if neceflary, to as great anamount
as may be expetSed at any future period. But
it is pvefumed that disbursements from the pub
lic Treasury will not be neceflary. It may be
queltioned whether on the plan of County Schools
appropriations of this kind, would be equitable
or just. The income of the State applied to dis
charge its debts, support the government, and
for other general purposes, so far as it goes, will
fupercede the neeefluy of taxation for those ob
jects : the way then appears to be fairly open
for an universal tax to support an univerfalplan
of education, so far as to comprehemi reading,
WRITING, GRAMMAR alld ARITHMETIC.
It ought to be taken for granted by all legisla
tive bodies that the people will be pleased with
nieafures which reason and experience shew will
conduce to their interestâbut, the public senti
ment is, and mull continue to be in favor of a
general difFufion of knowledgeâthis they know
cannot be obtained without expence ; and the
supposition ought not to be made that they would
not chearfully incur it, much less fupercede an
experiment in the cafe. .?
359
The cftabiifisment of county schools or aca
demies, will not be of universal utility they
will benefit the more wealthy part of the com
munityâand by the accommodation they afford
to this cjafs, willlelfen the number of those who
feel interested in a more general planâand,in the
fame proportion, procraltinate the period when
a fv Item for the poor as-well as the rich, shall be
adopted.
It is an imputation on the good sense of the
people, to ftippofe that they 1 would not with chear
fulnefs pay a tax for the support of learning
tor it mult occur to them that the rich wiil pay
more than their proportion, when they consider
that the major part of children are the inheri
tance of the poor anxl middling clafles of citizens.
The plan of education here Contemplated is,
that every person who pays a tax, however finnli,
shall have an equal right to the benefit nS this free
and universal institution.
The wealthy are interested peculiarly iri this
work of benevolence ; for the knowledge of the
people is x\\e ficurity of tranquility underajuft
governmentâwithout knowledge, they cannot
appreciate the value and importance of govern
mentâand hence the poflcflions of the rich,
among an ignorant people, are held by a very pre
carious tenureâunless the people are slaves.
The poor and middling clafles are deeply in
terested in this public provision for the education
of their childrenâFor it is tantalizing to fay that
there shall be no diftiniftions of ranks, or exclii
five privilegesâand that the avenues to the poll*
of honor and profit under the state and general
governments, /hall be accessible to all, without
diftintSion, who poflefs talents and virtueâwhile
the paths of learning are not, and cannot be trod
den by the poor.
There is a double security to the liberties of
the people derived from their being well.inform
edâ The firfl: is, it leads legislators to lie cautiou*
in ena<fting laws, led they infringe on the rights
of manâand secondly, it enables the people to
discern the more speedily those errors ordefigns
of an adminiftratioti which have an unfavorable
afpedl on the public interest and happiness. ,
Some old fable tells us, that Jupiter wasfo much
teazed by the prayers of mankind, that at length
he resolved to grant them whatever (hey asked.
But the spirit of discontent was so far from being,
allayed by it, that it broke out in murmurs more
than ever. If this tale were of modern date, we
should believe the author had intended a fling
at us. 1
Some time ago, before the new government
was put in motion, all the cry wasâwe are a poor
diftrefled nationâthere is 110 money, &c. The
revenue and finances are put into order, credit is
revived, and money is plentyâand now the cry
is louder than ever.âWe are too rich tQ free.â
Money is too plentyâthe people will not work
to earn it. * â¢
The Lanfingburgh paper fays, that on the no
mination of the Hon. Judge Jay, and Mr. Van
Ranfellaer, as Governornor and Lieutenant-Go
vernor of the State of New-York, at a large meet

appearedâand that the fame unanimity in their
favor appeared in every place from whence in
formation had been received. "

To be SOLD peremptorily, at Public Vendue,on Wednesday
the nth day of April next,
r j ""HE SEAT of the late Dotfior Lewis Johnson,
â *- deceased, in Perih-Amboy, containing TWO HUNBRtD
ACRES of LAND.
This place is bounded southerly for near a mile on the river
Raritan, where it empties into the bay about 18 miles from Sandy-
Hook, and affords two moll agreeable Gtuations for Gentlemens'
Seats. There are now on it, two brick houses, with gardens, and
a good colle&ion of fruit trees of the best kinds. The land is very
fertile, and a great part of it very good meadow ; and from i's situ
ation on the river, has the advantage of fifh of different kinds, in
t heir seasons, particularly of oysters and chicken clams, which may
be picked in great plenty on the flats before the doors. It is a
delightful, healthy situation, capable of genteel and tasty improve
ments; and as Perth-Amboy is one of the best sea-ports in the
United States, and within 18 miles of the sea, the profpett of its
increasing in value from that circumstance, is by no means incon
(iderable.
There will also be fold, other Lots, within the bounds of the
city, and about Five Hundred Acres of Land on the opposite fide
of the river Raritanâpart of which is improved bv a farmâon
which there is a framed dwelling-house and barn, with an orchard
of grafted apple trees, and will contain about one hundred and
fifty acres ; the remainder will be fold in convenient lots, well
wooded and timbered, and very convenient for supplying New-
York and other markets with fire-wood, timber for (hip build
ng, and other uses, the transportation by water being easy and
afe. The conditions will be made known at the day of sale,
,nd the requisite conveyances made by
JAMES PARKER and ) A r
BOWES REED \ the said EiiateÂ«
Likewise tÂ» it SOLD, Â«t tie Jime time and plan,
Â£LÂ£VÂ£N ACRES of LAND, adjoining the above, the pro
perty of the Proprietors of East New-Jersey, wherenn the pro
prietary house lately flood. The elegant situation of this spot is
hardly to be equalled ; it affords a grand profpeft of Raritan
Bay, and of the Bay formed by the waters of Raritan and Hud
fon'a rivers, where they disembogue into the sea to the East and
a jnoft delightful one of the Terpentine coiirfeof the Raritan river,
for several miles, through a rich traQ of meadow to the Weft.
The great quantity of stone neatly dressed, and brick, the remains
of the house lately burned, will be nearly fufficient for a new
building; and a large lone cistern, and well of excellent water,
with a very convenient ftablÂ£and enach-houfe, will greatly lessen
the expence of putting the place in order for the residence of a
Gentleman.âThere are few lituatioas so eligible, particularly in
the rummer seasonâwhen the cool sea breezes, and the elevated
fnuations, render them placet of pleasing retreat, from the confine
ment and sultry air of the southern states and neighbouring cities.
