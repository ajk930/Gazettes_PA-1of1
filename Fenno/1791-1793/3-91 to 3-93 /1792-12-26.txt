tAOU. THE COLUMBIAN LtNi INEI
THE MONITOR
On the moral infl'unci of v reaching.
IT is frequently said that the con
duct of men is ]inle influenced
by what they hear from the pulpit.
It is urged that many of the dis
courses are not practical nor adapt
ed to enlighten the mind. Admit
ting this, it is neverthelels anfwer
cd, that none of them recommend
an ill cotnfe of life, and many
preachers paint moral beauty in the
molt attrartive colours, or exhibit
the turpitude and meanness of vice
with so much truth and force, as to
make it appear loathfoine to its ve
ry followers. Those tvlio deny the
ufefulnefs of preaching, fay, that
Hs influence is momentary. There
is i rssr. " (ay they, ar the door
'â¢ <"â¢ â¢â¢Â»<! perhaps it opens,
of cons
bnt it is S
'-ut again and bolted.
TJie cwurfe of bad thoughts is nor
ftop'd at all, and that of bad acftions
for an instant only. The thought
]efs follower of vice plunges into the
world, and, considering lerious re
fleition as bad company, he con
nives to get ri d of it as soon as he
can. Tliefe objections only (liew
that good precepts w ill not preserve
us from falling, if the}' be not sup
ported by good habi;s. Yet many
fa lie concl ulions have been drawn
from tliefe confiderat ions. Why do
we pay for preaching, if wo fee inen
persist in vice as much as ever > Do
we hope better success at this day,
than the world, though it has grown
old in the attempt, has hitherto
fotjnd ?
Plausible as these idLeas frem, they
are not the less fallacious. Good
opinions alone will not fectirea man
against temptation. Yet if he be
inltrutfed iti his duty, he will f'ure
]y condemn himfelf for violating it;
and still more will he condemn ano
ther in a like cafe. The minister,
by teaching men what they ought
<>r ought no: to do, may npt guard
them against the allurements of
guilty pieafure, but he will do fome
thiiig towards p-'eventing error :
They wil. not nnllake whatduiyis.
Right thinking may not produce
Tight acTtionâit is however an ef
fentiai parr of our moral education.
To make duty pi3in is to (trip vice
ofthofe difgu'Tes, which it is oblig
ed to aU'utne in order to obtain its
jirtt victory over virtue. The mind
lhrinkj from that sense of removfe
which it well knows is sure to fol
low criminal indulgence. This re
straint alone is usually fufficient to
keep us from falling into great
trail fgreffions. This view of the
fubje<it regards the influence of
preaching only on the operations of
a man's own mind, without advert
ing to the shame of being seen ?s a
criminal by the world.
And if we confidcr that sermons
are addrefi'ed to our children as well
as to rhofe of mature age, we shall
fee the inestimable advantage of
having the young mind pre-occu
pied by good iniprellions, and as it
were, diiciplined to virtue.âThe
preacher, however, does more in fa
vor of morality. Shame has ter
rors not less formidable than those
of the law. Public opinion is the
judge, and the minifler of a ven
geance which cannot always prevent
crimes, but is sure to overtake the
offenders. Accordingly we find ihat
the morals of a people are nearly as
accurate as the general" fl:a;e of
â knowledge among them. Thecler
gy, by Jc-fcanting on our duties,en
able us to diitinguifir right from
â wrong, and by the frequency of
their addrefl'es, tbefe lions
become familiar. It is no final] ad
vantage to good morals to bring
men togetherâbut to do it on the
terms of their cbferving decorum,
and fitting in lilence as hearers, is a
Hill greater point gained.~Add to
this, while the nature and confe
rences of vice and virtue are re
piefented, each man turns his eye
en hinifelf, and feels conscious that
every man's eye is upon hiin. The
law ot opinion is not only interrupt
ed but actually enforced at the mo
ment. He feels awed by that pub
lic which he fees allembled, and en
gaged in the work of discounte
nancing vice. Thus, by enlighten
ing us in regard to our duties, and
as it were forcing upon an aflem
bled multitude the reflection upon
them, che clergy, though they may
not pievent the brcaclus of the mo
ral law, contribute a great deal to
wards securing the (anxious of it.
Public opinion mrliciS the punii'n
ment, and probably with more ef
fect both towards the prevention of
offences and the reformation of the
tranfgreflbrs, than if it were fuffer
ed at the whipping post or the pil
lory.
It has been before hinted that the
authority of public opinion is great
ly increased by aflembling men to
gether. To men of cold hearts and
sceptical philosophy the effects of
that mysterious sympathy by which
we fuffer or enjoy the emotions of
the beholders will seem incredible
âYet it is known that the moral
and political condition of Greece
was influenced by the discipline of
the Gym nail am, and the active e
mulation of their Olympic and Ifth
niian games. The excels of grief
or joy Jometimes proited mortal to.
the competitors.
Every congregation is with us a
moral school in which virtue is not
only rendered amiable, but public
ly confided to the vigilant protecti
on of an allembly deeply interested
and carefully inilrutfled to be faith
ful to the trust. It is the fault of
the minister if in those places vice
is not made to hang its head. Is it
faying too much, that with us the
church is the Gymnasium, in which
youthful virtue grows llrong by ex
eicife ! While facts Ihew that pub
lic opinion did so much in Greece ;
is it a ralh hypothecs to foppofe it
able to accompli/h so little in our
times ?
The liinit3 of this paper would
not allow us to pursue these consi
derations as far as we might do it
with advantage. The theory of
our eccl liallical institutions is cer
tainly excellent. Great credit is
due to our forefathers who laid the
foundations of them so deeply that
our halms concur with our interelts
as a people. It would be ufeful to
call the attention of the wife and
worthy to the means by which the
clergy might be rendered even more
refptÂ«flable and influential than
they are at present. Splitting of
parishes is certainly ail evil. Funn
ing funds for the support of miuif.
teis would be well repaid by secur
ing the peace of parilhes.
The result of these refieitinns is,
that our moral opinions are formed
in early youth and influenced af
terwards by I lie clergy. Who does
not know the sway that opinion
bears ? The world and ha polities
are governed by it. It is the bufi
-11 el's of the clergy to form and di
rect it in favor of virtue. This
work they never quit. They begin
almost at the cradle, and bear their
disciple company to the grave. This
order of men is of Ihe greatell nfe
to society. The laws govern by
force ; but they address themfelÂ»<Js
to men's hearts, foas that they shall
govern themielves. ,

I had written thus far when
I received a letter from his Excell
ency the Governor, which, as it is
directed to me in my public station,
and i elates to the bulinefs on which
I am now addrefling you, and as the
sentiments contained in it, perfectly
coincide with those which I have
uniformly exprefled from this place ;
it being also founded on a proclama
tion of the President of the United
States, expressive of the fame fenti
; I beg leave to lead an extract
from that letter (referring you to the
proclamation, which you have all
read or heard read) viz. " Sir, the
" Prelident has communicated to
" me a copy of a proclamation,
" which he ill'ued, in confequettce
" of certain irregular proceedings
" that have taken place, in particu
" )ar parts of some of the States,

" and I am desirous in every pro

" as to promote on every occasion,

" n<, therefore, Sir, to reqneft,
" that you will take every official
" opportunity to inculcate the in
" difpenfible duty of obedience to
" the atfls of Congress : and, par
" ticularly, that you will be pleased
" as far as the jurifditftion of your
" circuit extends, to charge the
" grand juries of the several coun

" quire into, and present, all of
" fences of the nature to which the
" proclamation refers. 1 am per
" fuaded, Sir, that you are convin

These sentiments of your Govern
or, corresponding with thole of the
President of the United States, will,
I trust, make a proper imprelfion
upon the people at large ; as they
have the fame tendency with those,
which a fenle of duty, an ardent
with to promote the peace, profpe
ritv, the liberties and social fclicity
of the people, have induced me to
endeavor to impress upon their
minds, with particular earneftnels,
in this infant State of our national
existence. I flatter myfelf that this
fiinilarity will give weight to the
addrefles which I have made (o the
Several grand juries (ince my ap
pointment ; and to lhe observations
which I am now going to make on
the fubjecl-inatter of the Govei nor's
letter.
Mod (incerely do I felicitate you,
my fellow citizens, in that i liave
no occasion to point out a 'ingle of
fender against the law under consi
deration. I have but of one
feeble attempt within this diltriifl,
to oppose the execution of itâthat
attempt did not appear to be ihe ef

By the 6th article of the conftiru
tion of the United States, that con
stitution, and the laws of the Uni
ted States made in pursuance there
of, are the supreme law of the land :
the Judges in every State are bound
thereby, and obedience is due to
them by every citizen ; if therefore
you, or any of you, know that any
offence has been committed, of the
nature to which the Proclamation
refers, it is your duty to pi efent the
offender. What although fomeof the
people of the United States, and 1 a
msng the number, may have difap

which they are members ? Js rvlilt

made by those whom the society
have delegated for that purpole,
jultifiable in a few who may have,
or effetft to have, objedions to it ?
No government could fubiilt, were
this allowed ; anarchy, individual
ruin and national dellruc r tion, mult
be the conlequence. It is equally
certain that a firm adherence to the
principles of the Union, and a due
obedience to its laws, and to thole
of the State, will have an equal ten
dency to en Cure to us, individual
peace and prosperity, and national
fafety and greainefs.
When we review the condudt of
the people of the United States du
ring, and since, the formation of
the Federal Constitution, and tha
cor.ftitutions of the several States,
with very few exceptions indeed ;
have we not very 11 long and pleas
ing evidence, that our fellow-citi.
Zens have displayed move real pa
triotism, and that they poflels more
political virtue and wifdorn, than
any other nation now in exiltence,
has done in similar circumstances ?
Had there cxilted among us, a num
ber of men of perverted talents and
desperate fortunes, or many men of
wild ambition and void of princi
ple, or hunters after popularity
without merit to deserve it, or craf
ty knaves greedy of power, and de
termined to acquire it by any means,
however base, they would have had,
during this eventful peiiod, ample
scope to have played upon the pas
sions of the people j and on no oc
calion more, than on the promul
gation of the law in quellion. From
the early prejudices imbibed againlk
the Excise Laws of Britain and Ire
land, by the citizens of thele States
who were natives of those countries,
I will venture to fay, that by i ing
ing vociferoufly and on every oc
casion, the changes on about a dy
zen of words against all laws for
railing a revenue from spirits dis
tilled within the United States, how
ever necelfary and however modi
fied, (and a Parrot might learn to
repeat the words in a few hours)
the dullest and moll ftopid chai
terer, might, for a while, have pas
sed for an enlightened patriot, and
the mod infignificant character, al
though destitute of every molil vir
tue, might have been elevated in
to political consequence. Mty we
not be as much surprised as \ie are
happy that so few of such charac
ter have appeared among us And
that the few who have appeared,
have been soon discovered and funk
again into their original infignifi
cancy, with very few exceptions ?
Popularity so gained, i& seldom of
duration among any enlightened
people. Kiitory will convince every men of reading and i~cfietTtioll
and experience every man or obler
vation, that give such people full
information lefpeifting public mea
i'uresâif they have time to think
for themselves they will generally
think right ; they will generally
confide in government while it de
serves their confidence ; but for
want of t his full in formation, a well
meaning people may be, and fre
quently are, led suddenly astray,
by such characters as I have dc-fcii
bed.
Think not my fellow-citizens,
that I recommend a blind approba
tion of all the Laws enacted by the
Legiilature of the United Slates, or
of this State: ftiould this Law or
or any 01 her Law of either, be dis
covered by experience to be defec
tive, opprelfive, incoHfiltent with
the principles of real liberty, or
partial in its operation, it istiie in
dispensable duty of every good ci
tizen who makes the discovery, to
point out to his fellow-citizens, with
manly freedom, which is always
accompanied with decorum, the evil
consequences which lie apprehends
from it, and to promote proper re
prefentaiions to those whom we
have intruded with the legislative
power ; as we chufe them freely,
and may chufe otheis in their (lead
at Hated and short periods, when
ever we disapprove of t heir condu<ft,
can we doubt that they will not pay
the utmoll attention to such repre
sentations ? We may be sure that
they will repeal every law liable to
such objections, or so modify it as
to make it promotive of the general
welfare, in the bed manner: of this
we have convincing evidence, in the
alterations which have already been
made in the firft law for raising this
revenue, by which it is made more
equal ; since which time the people
in this State, on this fide of the
mountain, seem very generally con
tented with it.
Indeed uulef \ it be unequal in its
operation and burthen, as between the
different States, no oppof.tisn to it
eould be apprehended from the citizens
of Pennsylvania, consistently with their
Federal character, as they had been long
accujlomed to an Excise of their
own, agaivjl which they did nvt co?ji~
plain. To conclude this head, when
this or any other revenue is paid ge
nerally by the community at large,no in
dividuals of that community can re
fufe or evade the payment of if with
out breach of moral houejiy and social
duty.
I would be wanting in juflice to the
AJfociate "Judges in this diftr itt, were J
not to declare that they perfectly join
with me in recommending obedicnce to
the Laws of the land, as indispensably
necessary to fscure and perpetuate the
peace, liberty, fafety and happiness of
the people.

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION DEFEATED.
TWENTY-FOUR Frenchmen, in and near
the town of Boflot, have entered a Protest
in the office of a Notary Public in Boston,
against the French Revolution. Upon finding
this to be the cafe, the King oj' Pruflia, and
the Duke of Brunfwick, have returned to
Vienna : There was nothing left for them to
do : Monarchy was restored in alt its pomp,
and splendor; the Baftile was instantly re
built ; all the NoblefTe were restored to the
right of ifTulng "heir Letters de Cachet, ac
coiding to antient usage; and the People'at
once fubinitted to a system of OpprfclTipn,
which they had groaned under for two cei^tu-
ries.
We embrace this opportunity to congratu
late the world on this important discovery.â
The wife and good men in Europe, have long
wished to find out Tome other Arbiter for the
fate of Nations, besides that of \Vai ; but ne
ver once thought of the Notary Public office.
This is an accidental discovery. But what
then ?âlt was by the accidental fall of an ap

It is said that Tippoo Saib will be here in
March, to enter a Protest in the fame of

of his expences : This may be considered as a
breach of the treaty, and his two Boys may
be crucified for itâbut then their friends will
protest against it. Socman the Third will be
here very soon, to enter his Protest against
that terrible Woman of Rulfia, for taking
Oczakow, and other ports of his Empire from

THE necessity in which the generals of the
combined armies in France have been
under of drawing fucceflively to them all the
German troyps which were on the Rhine, fir it,
the army of General Prince de Ilohenloe
Reichberg, then the corps which had remain
ed under the orders of Count d'Erback, has
left the field open to the French, not only v on
the iide of Tinonville wljeie they carried ofF
a considerable convoy, but also on the Rhine :
Having come from Straiburgh and Fort Lou
is, they attacked with a far superior force
the 3000 Auftrians which formed thegarrifon
of Spire, killed or made them prisoners, took
poiFeflion of the city, and sent the military
stores that were in it to Landau ; the alarm
was spread to Manheim, Worms, and even to
Metz, The inhabitants are taking to flight,
and the confteroation is general. This ex
pedition took place on the 29th September.
Above, on the Moselle, the French have made
a second irruption into the electorate of Tri
ers ; 5300 Frenchmen with 9 cannon entered
Metzig on the 29th, at 7 o'clock A. M. forced
the garrison to evacuate, destroyed the provi
sions, &:c.

ii The invasion which General Cnftine* has
made, by order of General Biron, into the ter
ritory 'of the Empire ; and the taking of
Spires, with the general magazine of militaiy
(tores for the Imperial army ; has spread ter
ror and confternatioh through all this part of
Germany. Our city is (hut up ; no one can
enter or go out of it. Even the navigation of
the Rhine is flopped, to the great detriment
of commerce. The number of fugitives come
here from Heidelberg, Worms, and all that
part of the Rhine, is considerable- Out of
3000 men who, under the orders of General
Winkelmann, guarded Spire and the military
/lores, very few have escaped. They were
aim oil all killed, drowned in the Rhine, or
made prisoners, they did not however give up
without making the bravest defence. The
French, the greatest part of whom came out
of Landau, were a body of 17 or 18,000 men.
Their ftiperiority was therefore too great to
he ruT.fted. It is said they intend to pursue
their march to this city. Having advanced
to the distance of one league from Kircheim
Pohland, where the Prince of Naflau Weil
bourg resides, the Court retired in hafce at io
o'clock at night, with their mod precious ef
fects, and arrived at Weilbourg. It was on
the 30th of September that Spire was taken,
a stroke which mull be considered as a most
important, if not a decifiv* one."

lofTes on that fide, although the official ac

France hope to propagate the principles of
their revolution in all the neighbouring coun
tries. People therefore begin here to be in
a very uneasy situation : the fermentation
which a certain party keeps up in the minds
of the multitude, increasing by the piefent
circumstances, orders have been given to a
military detachment torcp iir to Antwerp,
which is the focus of difaffe&ion. There is also
some agitation at Lorraine, and government
will be obliged to make use. of all their pru
dence, to prevent the etfe<fl of the idea which
begins to prevail, that the fate of the Nether
lands depends upon the success of the efta
blilhment of democracy in France."

COLOGNE, October 6.
The French army which came from Lan
dau under the command of General Cuftine,
after having laid a heavy contribution on the
Prince Bifliop, Chapter, Clergy, and Citizens
of Spire, continued 011 the 3d instant their
march to Worms ; and as they appear to in
tend to go through Mentz, Darmstadt, and
Frankfort, into the country of Hetie, the
principal inhabitants of those countries take
to flight, and secure their property as well as
they can. This evening we have seen seve
ral persons of diflin&ion arriving from Mentz
and the vicinity. A yatcht ha? brought from
CobJentz the military chest of the Prullian ar
my, with the public records, church orna
ments aud other precious effects. It is said
that that the French vanguard is already at
Kreutznach.
Extrafl oj a letter from Luxev. burgh, OH. 5,
" The accounts which we have from Ver
dun are very melancholy : The Prussian army
has been, for several days, in want of bread,or
ha" had none but of a very b;Â»d quality, as the
bread which they are obliged to carry there,
from a great distance, arrives ali green and
mouldy. It is nearly the fame with the Auf
triaij army. From our gates to Verdun, the
country is waste and almost a defart. As it
has rained for ibrne weeks together, the road>
are impafT-ble,niul are covered with hundreds
of dead horses."

that instead of forcing the French a>nv

Mr. B. Bourn, of the committee on the pe

which is, That after examining the fame, the
committee are of opinion, the prayer thereof
cannot be granted.
The bill for enrolling and licensing of ships or

the fifheries, and for regulating the fame, was
brought in engrofled, read the third time, and
the blanks therein filled up. The firft blank,
referring to the time when the aift now in forte
(hall ceaie, was filled with the last day of March
next.
The bill was then passed to be ena&ed.

The Speaker then signed the fame.
A letter was read from the Secretary of War
communicating, pursuant to orders from th

eight white persons, by the Indians, on the fron
tiers of Georgia. Laid on the table.
The petition of Henry C. Baker, an officer in
the late army of the United States, was read,
praying conipenfation for fervicck during the
war.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
on the petition of Udny Hay, was read: this r<-
port was in favor of the prayer of the petition,
which was for payment of the principal and in
terefl of a note for forty pounds, given during
the late war by two officers of the American ar
my, who had been captured at the northward.
The report was acceptcd by the House, ?nd a
committee appointed t* report a bill pursuant
thereto.
In committee of the whole on the bill to pro
vide for a reimbursement of a loan made of the
Bank of the United States. Mr. White in the
chair.
The bill was read by the chairman, aid the*
conflderedin paragraphs.
The firft fe&ion being read,
Mr. Giles said he was rather in favour of
postponing the business; but if it is peculiarly ad
vantageous to the interefl of the TJnitedStatest#
make provision for this object immediately, he
fuggelled whether it would not 4> e better, if
possible, to provide fÂ©rit without having recourft
to the expedient of a new lÂ»an. He >vas averse
frÂ©m increasing the debt of the United States by
additional loans. He was rather in favour ofap
plying the property belonging to the United
States in the Bank of the United States for the
purpose. He therefore moved, that the fe&ioa
should be struck out which provides for a loan,
in order to substitute a clause providing for the
sale of the (hares in the bank, owned by the I T .
States, that the proceeds may be applied to the
reimbursement of the loan.
Mr. Sedgwick doubted whether the motioq
was in order, as it went to a totally different
objedt from any fpecified in the bill.
The chairman remarked, that a motion to
lb-ike out the fe<stion,was in order.
Mr. Fitzfimons obferted, that if the idea oi
the gentleman was adopted, he was clearly o
opinio; - ., that the sale of the {hares wouli not
produce a sum adequate to the abje<&; as bringj
iag such a number of (hares to market won
undoubtedly reducc the price greatly below t \t
present market-price.
Mr. Giles said he was rather desirous of a polt
poncment of the fubjed:; he was not prepaie
to decide upon it; he fufpeÂ«sled m?n gentlemen
in the committee were in the â¢- ;dicament;
he wculd therefore withdraw his motion or
ftr -ting out, under a persuasion that nofudoen
w ;/!. take place.
Mr. l i.alimons slated fercral reafoni why the
cor. lit tee should proceed in the bufincfi; pf
ti:; t involves an economical disposal o
pr.. - ,:ow lying ufeleis; and a provifiou W
1 . - - r-tlie support of the public credit; no encreafe oi
the public debt is contemplated, laid he, but di
refily tlie reverie.
Mr.Chrkl'aid he never, wh'le he had a feat
in the house, would content to a foreign loan,
unlels the exigencies of the country were much
greater than at prel'ent. He had rather pay 7t
percent to our own utizeus than 5 per ceut to
foreigsers- He obje&ed to the indefinitenefs
of the fe&ion, and moved to amend it by add
ing a clause which Ihould confine the loan with
in the United States.
Mr. Fitzlimons suggested to Mr. Clark a
proviso agreeable to his own idea, that the in
terest be at 6 per cent.
Mr. Clark replied âhe said he had no doubt
ilmight be had M 6p?rcent. or less.
Mr. Williamfon said, he wiflied the gentle
man would point out, how he would contrive
to prevent foreigners from being our creditors,
even by confining the loan to the United States?
at an intereflof6 percent, you will in fait give
a premium of above ao,ooo dollars per annum,
which might be saved by opening a loan at 5 per
cent, in Europe;âdevile what contrivance you
please, said Mr. Williarufon, it mult be a foreign
loan.
Mr. Boudinot observed, that the motion o!
his colleague amounted to the fame thing in the
Â» result, as the motion for striking out thÂ« i'e&ion.
The loan is now at 6 per cent. To lay that a
new loan lhall be made at 6 per cent, to pay it
off, is losing all the advantages proposed by the
bill. He was therefore against the motion.
' Mr. Giles moved,that the commit fce Ihould
rife and report progress; he observed that very
material information was wanted, in his opini
on, to enable the committee to preceed under
ftandingly in the bufiaefs, The motion for the
committee's riling', was put and negatived.
\Tr. Clark's motion, to amend the seCtion by
aiding tl." word within before " United States,"
ft aiitrcMof iveu.
Tilt vsrui.mtea proceeded through the difcuf
flon of the retraining fu&ions.
Mr. M'.oiibn offered frveral observations to
fcew the propriety of postponing the bill for a
few days, in order to the memburs having time
to revolve in their minds several propositions
which have been suggested in relation to this bu
fmefs:âWhether, by an appropriation of the
sum, which, it is fa id, now lays dormant in the
TreasuryâWhether by a sale of the shares in
the bank, or by a loan, to provide for the objecft.
Mr. Fit|fimons flatedfome objeiftions to what
_ fell from the gentleman last l'peaking. The gen
tleman's idea goes to an immediate interference
with an appropriation already made, and leaves
to a contingency a proviSon to supply its place.
Mr. Madison replied to Mr. Fitzfimons; he
tl'.onght the gentleman offered as good a reason
as he co-lid have suggested in favour of applying
the money in the treasury to the objedt now in
queltion.
Mr. Giles urged postponementâhe remarked
that (he 2eal shewn by some gentlemen, to pre
.lipkafe the bulinefs to a decision, amounted to
an ejKile-efjieljheratioÃ cn-thefubjc<9-.
â¢Mr. Sedgwick stated several reasons which
remiered it absolutely necessary that no delay
should takÂ« plate. A motion being made, that
the committee should rife and report the bill;
the fame being put, was agreed to.
The committee rose accordingly and reported
the bill with one amendment; which was, to
Alike out the word " fifteen" in the firft fedh
on, referring to the lime for which the loan
ihould be madeâthis amendment was agreed to
by the house, and the bill laid on the table by ge
neral consent.
Mr. i*arker moved the following resolution :
That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed
to lay before this House an account of the appli
cation of the monies borrowed in Antwerp and
Amsterdam for the United States, during the
preient year. This motion was agreed to.
A memorial of Joseph Bennett, and a memo

depended on. There being no official
iupplement publilhed, according to ctif
torn, vvuh the Bruffcls Gazette, indicates,
at least, no fuccels having taken place.
Another report, better authentica
ted, which circulates here, and which is
written from BruffeU, by the Britiih i)ii
niiter there, to the ambaflador at this
is, that the combined armies have
been obliged to make a retrogade move
ment, supposed to proceed from the abso
lute want of provi(ions--a mortality which
had taken place among their hoifes, and
difcafes among their men. If this is the
cafe, and that they fliould be forced to
retire from France, it will be attended,
probably, with consequences of a serious
nature for themklves, and place the con
teit in a very unexpected position.
" The last accounts from Bruifels, be.
fore this, were, that the Irer-ch army
was fo'furrounded as to have allied to ca
pitulate. 1 his was so fully believed, that
the govei nment of the Low Countries sent
an express with it to their minister here,
who immediately announced it in such a
public and official manner, as to have
somewhat exposed that government, it
being now certain that the details and
circumstances, as then related and said to
be received from the King of Pruflia,
were not true. I
" On the French fide, they (late this
offer of capitulation as an overture of ne
gociation from the Duke of Brunfwick.
" A letter which 1 have just seen, be
ing the copy of an extract of one from
Gen. Dumourier, at St. Menehoud, to
Gen. Biron, at Strafburg, affirms this to
have been the cafeâa truce had been a
greed on, as he states it, between his ar
my, and the' Pruflian army alone.
adds, " Le Due de Brunfwick tiaÃ fpbft
cd all by fending me a declaration : so
no more truce, as I ftiall annouce to him
this evening." This was the iftofOdio
ber. He adds, that he had begun to op
pose the enemy with an army of 17,000
men, and that he now had 100,000. â 
That the duke of Brunfwick had begun
with 80,000, of which he had already
loft 25,000 âand other things of this
kind, in his style. Altho' the details of
his letter are certainly exaggerated, yet
they serve to (hew that he is no longer in
the difficult position in which he was not
long before, and which gave rife to the
intelligence mentioned from BruiTcls.
" The account you will fee in the Ley
den supplement of to-day, of the French
havingenteredtheempire, may berelicd on,
they hi e also in pofTeffion of Savoy, where
the people join them, and are for muni- ;
cipalizing their country. Should these
dispositions pass the Alps, and seize the

the military would probably join them."

COMMUNICATIONS.
As the people cannot adminijler government them.-
Rives, they arc compelled to delegate the trufl.
From that moment a feparaec inter efl prefnts it
filf. In Jome of /V agents .virtue will reft A the
temptation The fear of dete&itm ft.// V
cJJ>as. But in tne Intajis wkei* avimct prevails
this praHice will be conjlant in its efforts to turn the
public ccmmiffion to private account. This is human
natuie. To be fare of it, refleÃ on the abufs that
would swarm in a body of men appointed for life,
and concealed, from the public eye. The fame re
fection warns the people to vigilance in exercijtrrg the
rights of election, and in obfeiving the con duff of
those who obtain their temporary confidence. It ef
pecially warns them that their duties become more ur
gent in proportion to the difiance oj those in public
J rom the eye of their conflituents, and the fc
crecy of the opporiiniities for taking advantage of
their Jituation. A delegate three or four, tr fven
or eight hundred miles ojf y at a place fet do m visited
by an acquaintance, farcely ever by a. rival, escapes
much of the responsibility felt by members of a local
legislature. Avd where a great public debt is under
the management of the government, and a great mo
vied inflitution is combined with both y what peculiar
alluremenrs what dangerous opportunities, arise
from the hidden manner in which certain paper tranf
anions may be conduced ? The true patriot mho con
siders these things zuill not the less exhort the people
to refpett the laws and dfcharge their public obliga
tions. But the fatje one alone will advije the people
to place a blind reliance on the virtue of their rulers ;
â  tv rwn a dejj car ta every juggefiian of aHfes ; to
make no diflinttion between the mea furls of the go
vernment itfef, and to regard as secret enemies of
the latter all who freely examine the sources and
tendencies cf the former.
The funding system of the United States must
daily appreciate in the estimation of the people.
1 he superior policy of placing the finances of our
country under the management of one per/on is
flrikingly aprarent when we find that there a
roong the oppofe'rs of the fyftrm as many differ
ent plans as there are individuals who compofc
the opposition.
It has been noticed ; and the circumstance
merited attentionâthat the funding system of
the United States which has so wonderfully re
trieved and cftabliHtied our national credit, has
combined with the benefits of the individual
creditors, peculiar advantages to the government
âadvantages encreafing with the funds, and ex
panding with the resources of our countryâ-and
yetâ it can hardly be believed, this circumflance
is a fubjed oi cavil.
EXTRACTS
From the Speech of his Excellency Gov. Martin,
to the Legijlature of North-Carolina.
u WHEN we contemplate that part of the
Federal Constitution which has limited the
Supreme Executive of the United States to
the duration in office for four years, and then
to descend to the class of* private citizens,
from among whom the person to fill that high
offic* again is to be railed, by the people of
these states; we cannot but feel our own dig
nity in fticli a government, and be aft'e&ed by
such a distinguished privilege ; by which supe
rior and exalced merit may be rewarded by
re-appointment, or demerit deposed; and
such other person calied forth to this station,
as will befl answer the expectations of a free
people, in administering and securing their
government.
44 And now, having compleated nearly the
period of office, ascertained by the constitu
tion of government of this state, for the con
tinuance of the executive in the fame person,
with picafure I shall mingle with my fellow
citizens, and feel with them the effects whe
ther good or had, of that administration in
which I have been concerned. Imp re fled in
the mean while with the mofl lively sense of
gratitude, I retnrn you my molt hearty thanks
for the honors of the government the legiilu
ture have been pleated repeatedly to confer
on meâhappy in the reflexion, if in any mea
sure I have answered the expectations of my
country. My warmest wilhes atterd you in
fixing your choice on a AiccelTor, whose repu
tation and abilities may do honor to your ap
pointment, and give dignity to the govern
ment of a people, for whose profpei ity and
national happiness I feel myfelf much inter
ested, and for whom my prayers (hull never
be wanting.''
