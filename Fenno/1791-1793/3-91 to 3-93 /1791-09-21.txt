FROM T HE % COLUMBIAN CENT IS EL
AMERICAN FUNDS,
Mr. Russell,
QO short is the time whiph bath eiapfed since the establishment
O of public, credit by the Funding Sylfcem,.and pun&ual payment
ot the interefi, that the people fee m not to have tormea jutl ant'
fixed idea? asto the permanent value of their property in the funds;
hence arises the fluttation in the price of (locks. These flu6}ua
tions being injurious to the people in general, it is the duty of go
vernment, and of every individual, to use endeavors to cftablifh a
just and fixed price to the funded Securities. The raoft natural
and rational standard for our Funds, feetns to be the Brilijk\ be
caufc we are well informed refpeÂ£?ing every circumstance ielating
to them. But it must be allowed that the fma Unci's of our debt,
compared with the lijitijh, and the Superiority of our situation in
many important refpeds, ought to give our Funds the preference.
It is allowed by the Britifti writers, that their nation in regard to
â wealth, and numbers, and profpe&s, is come to its heighth ; but
all the world fuppofesthe wealth and numbers, and profpetts of
America are increasing rapidlyâand that the United Stales will be
come the mod wealthy, powerful and happy nation, under the
fun. These being the state of things, nothing is wanting to ren
der the American funds permanently higher than the Britijh y but
just ideas refpeÂ£ting them. The Britifri people, and" (our own for.
merly) have been in the habit of thinking their funds the belt in
the world, but they, and the reft ot the world, will soon be con
vinced from the present slate of Europe and America, that the Fund.s
of this country are in many particulars luperior to the Britijh, or
any in Europe. As the territory of the United States is much larg
er than all the kingdoms and States of Europe, and polishes all
the variety of climate, foil, and situation, moil tavorablr for agri
culture, manufacluresi and commerce; âAs the mcreafe of peo
ple, and the emigrations from Europe, and the progress in every
thing tending to the growth and prolperity of a nation, have been
and now are fully anfwcrable to the natural advantages of this
country, it ought in reason to be a fixed principle in every mind
that our Funds are now fully equal to the British, and will rife
higherâFour per cent, for money in American funds, paid every
three months, is the great eft sure profit to be any where obtained
âand will be an object with every man of property. As the peo
ple of this country, are abundantly able to hold their own debt,
and as it will be beneficial to the country, it is wifiied foreigners
may not purchase into Americann Funds.
Speculators will aim to keep up a fluctuation, as their trade de
pends upou vps and downs, but every wife ruler and good citizejn
will exert himfelt to make the funds permanent-at then uuevalue,
as this would greatly facilitate all kinds of business, and eilentially
promote the general prosperity of the country.

f [ MEMOIR,
ADDRESSED TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AXD FRENCH
I NATION,
j BY LOUIS JMEPH BOURBOK CON'DE,
j In answer to the Decree of the nth oj June.
I PROSCRIBED by a milled people, and To long perfccuted
\ X with an unprecedented fury, I now come 10 cxpiefs the facud
Manguagc oftru:h to the reprcfeniatives of the nation, to confound
impoflure and calumny, and to lay open my whole toul.
I know that I have been, and Hill am, daily cxpofed to the
fhafisof malignity ; I know that the bare mention of my name
ierves as fuel to public hatred ; t>ut I must at length tear off the
bandage from the eyes of my cruel enemies, and present myfclf
to them in the armour of truth.
A simple account of my conduct since the revolution, will, per
haps, open the eves Â«f a noble, but volatileâa humane, but in
conliftent people', who, always extreme in their hatred as in their
love, fuffer thcmfclves to be carried away by the impull'e of the
present fentimenf.
On the 14th of July, 1789, in the moment of a terrible explo
sion, I thought it my duty to quit the capital, to escape from
evils, perhaps from crimes. Soon alter I thought it right to leave
France, to take away all pretence for frefh outrages. This volun-
Jary exile was a facrifice to the public tranquility. At a diftancc
from my country, 1 waited, in melancholy expe&ation, the
moment when the French nation, reftorcd to milder fer.timents,
and to its native urbanity, should permit me to return. I was
far from thinking that my expc&ation, perpetually deceived by
new troubles, and frefh calamities,, mull be lated to fee so deli
cious a moment inceflantly removed to a dillant period, and that
calumny and hatred, guarding the entrance of France, would pre
vent my apptoach to it. 1 was far from imagining, thai a pro
greflive fci icsof horrors and usurpations would bring on the creat
ed of crimes; and that a King, lately the delight of his fubjc&s,
"would be kept in his own palace as a State Pi ifoner ! and that (ah !
how could I think it ?âpofterity will with difficulty believe it !)
â I should myfelf be tempted to consider this cruel fpe&acie as
one of thofc tormenting vifioms which sometimes harrafs our fouls
10 sleep !
I muftdraw the veil over these affe6ling scenes ; expreflions
â¢cannot describe them ; thev can only be felt. Ah ! what lan
guage can paint the impreflion made upon my mind by the fight
of my King, the heir of St. Louis and Henry the IVth. drinking
the cup of bitterness, c7;hauftcd with outrages, and funk into the
d-pth of misery, aliec having in a short space of time borne every
kyid of misfortune, and felt every variety of fufferiry* ?
(yHow {hall I a: this time dare to speak of myfelf shall I
paint theinjuftice T have expeiienced, when I fee before nÂ»e still
greater ?JCan I compare my fuffcrings with those of the king ?â
No matter ; I nvuft speak, since I am called upon ; I mult lay
open my heart, since franknefs is required of me; it shall be
worthy of a Carnde ; it shall be worthy of a Frenchman.
I have bceu represented as the (worn enemy of the French na
tion ; who, / ndefatigable in my hatred, have hern endeavoring 10
raise enemves against them in all the courts of hurope ; as an ene
my eager '.0 bi mg fire and sword into the heart of his own coun
*ry ; and I am now industriously represented a* a tiger athirfl toj
blood, watching the favorable moment to tear its prey in pieces.
AiTurrdly, neither my anceflors normvfelf were ever the par
tizans of despotism ; and the hiftorv of France produces many
<-xao>pks to Uic contraiy, taken out of my family. âIlcnry Comic
fought for liberty of confciencc ; and the second Henry of the
â¢me name attacked the delpoi ism of the Regent and her Minif
rs during the minority of Louis XIII. and openly declared
himfelf the Protestor of the Tiers Etat. The Great Conde, uni
ted with the Parisians armed under his command, attacked the
tyrannical power of Cardinal Mazarine.
In common with all good Frenchmen, I was desirous of the
afTembling of the States General in 1789. I even advised the
King to lake this measure. I always detested abuses, and abhor
red the despotism of Miniftcrs. 1 have long formed in the bot
tom of my heart, a fiucere wish lor the refto'ration of the finances,
and the regeneration of the kingdom. Alas !itis to this fatal de
sire, then participated by almost the whole nation, that France
owes the evils which now con fume her, and if the desire of doing
good could be a crime, with what bUternefs might we now le
proach ourselves.
But it is not the thing itfelf but the abuse of it which has destroy
ed the kingdom ; it is envy, jealousy, ambition, and Jicentioufnefs,
which, united under the mafkof liberty, have laid waste this pow
erful Monarchy. And it is expe&ed that I fbould come into the
mid ft of the factious to applaud these horrors ! Even partake in
them by my presence ! A French Prince is wished for amidst these
ruins, to witness the last grafpof Monarchy : No, I would rather
confeut to a perpetual banifhrrtent ; I would rather abandon all
my to fire and plunder, than return into the kingdom
mthemidft of disorder, and after the commission of the tnoft
f'diGus crime. No, France shall never again behold me within
hci limits, so long as reason and justice are banished from hef,
and so long as she is the prey of the factions who mificad her. If
the French, at a future time of opening their eyes, fliake of the
yoke of their new tyrants; if they will acknowledge that liberty
does not empower men to feizc and destroy every thing, and fub
jedfc it to their ferocious chimeras ; and if they should at length
learnthat a nation has not a right to be unjust to a single indivi
dual, then I fay, I will hasten wish the grcateft cagernefs, I wi,ll
fly into the arms of my fellow-citizens.
But, perhaps this time is not far offâfoon terror will pofTefs
the fouls of those criminally ambitious men who have made the
most polished people in the universe the most savage. Heaven
and men will not fuffer fojmany crimes to go unpunilhed. As to
myfelf, I shall not dirett my arms against my country :âfaftious
men always wiftito identify themselves with it ; but the reft of
the French, and all Europe, are not to be imposed upon. He is
not a traitor to his country who woiiM take the mask cfF them ;
and a decree, into which the religion of the Aflembly has been
surprised, and the illusory fan&ion of the King, cannot make me
a rebel. I have received the person who brought me this injuri
ous decree with the attentions due at all times, and under all cir
: cum fiance's, to thfe chara&er" of an Envoy, and to the law of na
tions. I have received this Decree, and thisis my answer. I de
clare it boldly ; and I make it public, that the Aflembly, France,
and Europe may read, at the fame time, into the bottom of my
heart, and judge me. i

COMRADES in France. /
" YE French !ârelatives and friends ! of all ranks,
sex, and of all ages ! âknow ye, been employed in fol
lowing the measures adopted by out General, and in using our
endeavors, so give etfccacy to the efforts made by the Marquis de
Bouille to Tave the Royal Family, and to break the fetters of the
bell and molt unfoitunate of Kings!
" The insults, to which we have been obliged to submit, are
lot to br described ; yet wc had tljc courage to ISeaf them all with
patience: because we fialterta ourselves with the pleating hopes
ihat we (bould, at Tome time or other, reap the fruits o/.our mo
deration and prudence.
" One Tingle word, one rash (lep, might have ruined all our
schemes, and Iruftrated all our attempts to set our King at liberty,
and to restore him to his exalted ilate in the midst of those bis
fubjefty, whose loyalty remains unshaken.
" Nothing has been able'to cool our zeal: our attachment to
the King h?s remained iirin amidst. insults, outrages, and perfec
tions of all kinds.
" The moment âso long wiflied for, and which has been pru
dently provided forâhas arrived ; but unfortunately it has been
produ&ive of fatal consequences to the French Nation, or rather
to all true Frenchmen. Our projefls are all fruftrated ; our hopes
are vanished into air ; our fouls are full of bi.tternefs and anguilh;
and we should be, at this moment, a prev to despair, were we not
convinced that our military brethren, and all other true French
men now in France, who have been prevented from treading in
the (legs of the Marquis de Bouille, will adopt our profeUion of
fidelity j which we now tranfinit to the corps, ft ill remaining, but
almost at the laftgafp, of one of the most gallant armies in the
univerfc.
44 The outrageous, insulting, and barbarous manner in which
the French nationâbecome ferociousâwatched every step of the
most unfortunate of Princes, the departure of the Kingâhis sub
sequent arrcftation at Varenncsâhis forced return to the capital;
âall these circumstances prove to all the world, the crimes of a
fa&ion, and the captivity of our mailer.
"We therefore con fid er every thing which the foi difeint Na
tional AGembly have done, as null and void.
" We declare that we shall never lubmit to any other govern
ment than that of a Monarchy.
" We demand a free King ! âWe demand our Xing!
" It is the duty of the Frertch Nobility, formerly famed for
lovalty, u is the duty of every French soldier to fly to the relief
of his King, to tear him away from his piifon, to facrifice our
lives and fortunes for this unfortunate Monarch, to pursue, to our
last moments, the monsters who have wrested the sceptre from his
grasp, and have placed it in hands blasted with mon
gers who have dared to insult the tendered of mothers, a mother
in whose veins flow the noblest blood in the universe !
Â« We are rcfolved to live, and to die, profefiing the religion o!
our anccftors.
ii 44 Wc theiefore swear, and our oath will be applauded by the
whole world, that we will transmit, to our childrenâto our
neighboursâto our friendsâthe molt implacable hatred against
all fa&ious persons, who live on rapine and murder.
44 All those, who flill remain loyal to their King, and to the
French Monarchyâall thofc who are the friends ot mankindâ
must rid the wdYld of those monsters who infefl the finell king
dom upon earth, who insult the best of Kings, and who bli:idly
lead, to every excess and outrage, a nation formerly dillmguifhcu

or who Hi all dare to touch their Majeflics ;âand we lhall consider

" Neither fire nor sword, neither flames nor prison, nor the

The Diet are busy relative to a plan proposed

il/ this country, amounting to from 5 to 700,000
i/clividuals, and they they will probably experi

Electoral Hignefs presented the Count with a va*
luable fnufF-box.
The labours of the Diet employed on tlie Con
stitution are almost at an end. The principal
objeift of deliberation which remains, is the es
tablishment of Municipalities and the interior
adininiltration of towns.
N JERSEY, July 6.
Since the bringing back of the King, it is be
come very difficult for the French Aristocrats to
emigrate. As soon as a Jersey veflel arrives at
Grenville, or St. Malo, three or four chaloupes
are moored round her, to prevent the exportati
on of men or money. An express arrived yester
day from'the latter place, to a Jersey man, who
Jiad brought foine paflengers over, with private
advice, that if he returned to France, he would
inevitably be hanged. Several, however, made
their escape on Sunday.
Some of the emigrants were preparing to em
bark for Oftend,ou the intelligence of the King's
escape. But since they have been informed of
his captivity, and of the disposition of the French
nation to refill all attempts of a Counter Revo
lution, the barometer of their fpiritsaud of their
hopes has fallen very law.
PARIS, July 8.
It became a question of etiquette, whether, in
the prelent situation of affairs, Ambafladors from
crowned heads (hould continue in Paris, and they
all desired to have inffruiftions from their respec
tive Courts. Earl Gower received immediate in
ftru<flions to remain, and they all continue to
make their appearance at the Thuilleries, and
to tranfadt business avec le Roi as usual.
You will fee, from the Declaration of 290 mem.
bers, that the Royal party is by no means extin
guished in Paris. You find them every where,
and it is a proofof the confidence of the majori
ty, that the malcontents are at perfe<fl liberty to
speak, write, hold their confutations, and to be
as outrageous as they please.
The profpecft of the harvest in France is good
beyond the memory of man. The corn countries
were never so loaded, and they are not overrun
rby game, to destroy and eat np the bounty of
providence. " All this," laid a joyful farmer, in
tne neighbourhood of Montreuil â" all this Mon

LETTER from M. Rocderer, a celebrated Patriot,
to M. Bouille.
" I received yellerday, Sir, a packet with tlie
poll-mark of Luxembourg, sealed vvitl) your
arms, containing a printed copy of your letter to
the National Allembly. I flatter myfelf that in
iranfmitting this letter to me, you wish to indi
cate that 1 am personally intereiled in the insults
which it contains, and 1 thank you accordingly.
" Perhaps you may recolledt a conversation
which we had together at Metz, during the epoch
of the Revolution. 1 was then at the head of the
Patriotic Party, and you were commandant of
that place. The citizens diflrufted you ; they
were afraid lett you lhould invite the King, and
those courtiers whom the Revolution had con
demned to the punishment of equality, within
their walls. You were at that time the cause of
a continual fermentation, but you were taught
to know (how much havejou (ince forgot this
ul'eful leilon !) that your cannon wereol'no avail
against the eternal batteries of reason, which
fiom the Priuting-houfe as Laudouiu, began to
humble all the supporters of Tyranny and of Ty
rants, and which, be allured, will continue to
humble them, to whatever distance they may re
treat, or within whatever citadel they may en
trench themselves.
" Penetrated with these truths, so humiliating
to you, you then waited on me and alked methis
questionâ" Do you think that the public wel
fare, demands that 1 fhoiild give up my command !
If you do, I am ready to give in my resignati
on." " If the fugitives," J replied, " intend
to rally in this country ; if the King intends to
to take refuge here ; if Metz is destined to be
come the cradle of a Civil War, I with you were
a thoufarid leagues distant. But on the contrary,
if the King ihould adhere to the Conltitutiort, if
the fugitives difperled throughout the world are
content to ac r t thepart of Knights-Errant, I (hall
be-very happy to fee in the chief garrifan of our
frontiers.a General like-you, who has gained the
attachment of thefoldiery, and is capable of en\
forcing obedience at home and iefpe(ft abroadv'\
" Your reply to me was a memorable
lam able to recapitulate it exactly âI give yon
my"word of honor, toeujorce the Decrees of the Na
tional A[feml>!y with my utmoj/ power, whether 1 ap~
prove them or not ; 1a!fo pledge my word oj honor,
never to involve my country in a Givil-War.
" Perhaps this couverfation has been recol
lected by you firrce vour arrival at Luxembourg ;
you may have been afraid lelt one of the -words
of honor which you have betrayed Ihould be for
gotten, and you have undoubtedly addrefied your
letter tome, for fear that this claim to public
infamy /hould lofe.lis just reward.
" If this is your motive, Sir, 1 doubly thank
you for your correspondence.
" For some time part, Philosophy has laboured
to diihonour honour, and to elevate Virtue in its
room. Louis XVI. and you have at one and the
fame time rendered this i'crvice to the nation,and
have advanced the morals of mankind at leaf!
half a century nearer perfection.
"In fine,l hope thai public opinion and the laws
will no longer confine themselves to fmts of chi

played, had been the means of preserving those

July 14. M. de Liancourt attended the tri
bune, and drew a uioft lively and animated pic
ture of the prefenc situation of France. He de
clared that he would deliver bis opinion with all
the courage of a man who is free and indepen
dent. He said, that to oppose the inviolability
of the king, yvould be to overturn the conftituti
-011. " A king who is not inviolable, (fays he)
cannot be ail hereditary king, but a king of a day."
Whether the king in his flight, be considered
as a king, or a simple citizen, his person is invio
lable.
One thin" is wanting to onr revolution ; that
is the liberty of the king. To complete the con
ititution, it was jieceflary that the King, at a dil
tatice from Paris, might be enabled to re&ify all
defecfts, and afterwards come back to his capital
with all the dignity of a man who forms an inte
gral part ofthe constitution.
Arc then measures, adopted with that salutary
view, to be thought criminal ?
M. de Liaticourt then observed, that previously
to the sth of Ocftober, the king had not any thing
to do with the declaration of rights.
His next attempt was to juftify the declaration
which the king had left behind him when he left
Paris. He spoke highly in praise of the king's
personal integrity, of his love of justice, of his
fondnefs for his people, and of his endeavours
to rectify all kinds of abuses.
Tlie king, fays he, is no longer a king, except
for those who have the courage *udefpife all fac
tious people.âThe king is attacked, but through
him it is that royalty is intended to be deftroyedc
It is by the fall of one that foine seditious people
hope to be on a level. His concluflons were that
the projert of the committees ought to be adopted.
M. de Lialicourt was mod virulently attacked
'Jjy'M. Ricard, whose arguments solely confiftecf
personal reflections.
â¢ M. de Liancourt's answer was that of a gentle
man.
M.Touftain de Tide asked if the King be not
liable to be tried, what methods the committees
would Adopt to prevent Louis XVI. from corrupt
ing, with his lift of thirty millions, as many peo
ple as he pleases. How, fays he, will it be pof
jible to prevent him from choosing another de
Calonne to be put at the head of the finances,
and another de Bouille to be at the head of an
army ?
M. Badier made a fpeerfi well becoming the
deplorable iituarion of a man who has a straight
waistcoat on. Of course it cannbt be worth re
peating. According to him, a perjured man, a
traitor, a parricide, a house-breaker, or a high
way man, are complete gentlemen, compared to
Louis XVI.
M. Montefquiou with great energy, defended
the King and the Monarchy, aful spoke with zeal
against the arguments of the wholfe republican
'phalanx.
M. Frngnon argued forcibly on the fame fide.
M. Roberfpierre watof a different opinion;
and his speech was much in the fame ftyleasthat
of M. Badier.
M. Duport delivered his sentiments in favottr
of the King, and in favor of monarchy, and his
arguments were irrefiltilvly conclusive. He very
ap ly alluded to the English constitution, of
which the king is the perpetual equilibrium.
The farther difcuflion of the fubjecft was at
length adjourned to the day following, which,
Vve may fafelv prophecy, was one of the mod tu
ni ul rno us of. all the noisy days since the aflembly
was felf-created.
From the very puny (late of health which the
Dauphin labors under it is not expe<fted that he
will live out hisa-pprenticelliip ; in cafe of death,
the Democrats will be gratified with their favor
ite fyflem, unless they should happen, by that
time, to go uito the other extreme, which is not
improbable.

projected canal between Hereford and Glouces

ERUM THE BEE.
THERE is a strange propenfny in perlons of genius, to obtrude
forgeries on the public, and a ftilj stranger propenfuy in the
public, to admit them as genuine, without anv examination at all.
Let me give a few instances in proof of this; they are the firft
that occur to my memory. " The memoirs of a Cavalier" was
twenty years ago an esteemed book of authentic history: that it
was a lorgery, some unknown writer demonstrated, in an Edin
burgh magazine ; nevertheless it would have maintained its repu
tation, had not a sudden zeal for the glory of Daniel Derte lately
announced him as the ingenious former.
There are many who Bill bjieve Hardicanutc to be an ancient
ballad, though the language, manners, every thing, shew it to be
a modern composition, and though the author be perfe&ly well
known.
" The travels of Mr. Marshall" had their reign, though (hort,
over popular credulity. Genel/i and Kolbcn still keep their ground.'
" The letteis of Pope Gangantlli" were read with much admi
ration, even by protestants: but Voltaire deteded the imposture,
and justly ; for he owed that to the public.
It is but the other day that " the letters of the Duchess of Or
leans" came out with a new aflortment of chara&ers and anec
dotes. The impoftuie haidly lived to fee a translation from the
French.

COMMUNICATIONS.
The ted of patriotifin in almost every country
where rhe government has long been eltablifhed,
has been considered as confiding in an opposition
to the exiding adminidration. On this princi
ple, what a fucceflion n f patriotic charatfters have
rilen, and floated for a time on the sea of British
politicsâWhen the triumphs of a Marlborough had
eclipsed in glory, all his cotemporaries, and had
thrown the exploits of ancient heroes into the
and high-churchmtn, unable to be
hold the splendor of his actions, formed a coali
tion, and became the patriots of the dayânor
could the nation have red, till ihofe patriots suc
ceeded to the appointments enjoyed by the ob
jects of their enmity and malignity.âln Wal
pole't time, the patriots rung an inceflant peale
in the ears of the people, till, having effected
the removal of that odious minider, their zeal
was cooled by the breath of royal favor. Stars
and garters succeededâand the patriotifin of
a Pulteney was hid in the blaze of a coronet.
In the reign of George the Third, what a series
of patriotic names in rapid succession havepafled
away !âtill the present prime ininiiter, Mr .Pitt,
became fixed, changes wer* perpetually taking
placeâMany and powerful were the exertions
tnade to effedt hit removal ; they have hitherto
proved ineffe 'tnal; and conrary to former times,
167
thefwnJs of the government flow begin to as
sume with its oppofirs the honourable appellati
i on of patriots. rr
Â® ut , j Â£ he P e ople of England are justly to be ap
plauded for their attachment to an adminiftrati
son which has done more in seven years â¢ to re
trieve their affairs, than had been effected in the
Jf 1 , \ U !.y Preceding .years, yet, that this spirit
ftould dilcover itfelf in the revival of prejudices,
which to the honor of human nature are ahnofl:
extinrt in every other country, is greatly to be
lamentedâ" Church?nen and ' -Diffe/itets," âWhat
grating founds for the 18th century ! Religiour
bigotry and intolerance, are yniverlally repro
bated by the enlightened part*of mankind ; and
it is no longer afubjecft of conjecture, but of ac
tual experiment, that the human mind may be
left in perfetft freedom, as to religious and moral
truths, and the mode of performing religious
worihip ; while at the fame time, all the pur--
poses for which government ought to beinftitut
ed, are fully obtained and realizedâOf this trufh
the, United States, under the present form of go
vernment, exhibit inconteftible, and irrrefraga-'
ble evidence. ___
It has been said that " there is a system of
opinions peculiar to every age"âthe experience
of the present day fully confirms this sentiment;
one opinion of the present system is that liberty
ought 10 bs universal; happy would it be for the
human race were mankind united, in the means
of eftetfting this noble idea ; but as in our pur
suit of happiness the route is as various, and as
opposite, as the tastes and propensities of our
species, so in refpetft to the methods to be adopt
ed for the attainment of universal Freedom, Jll
- paflion, ignorance and prejudice hi
therto presented infuhnountable barriers to the
efforts of the friends of humanity. In the Uni
ted States, Liberty found a foil congenial to her
nature ; the way was prepared for the compleat
triumph of her charms ; we freely admitted her
influence into our hearts, and prepared an im
mortal dome for her refidencein a just equal and
energetic government.
In Europe she has to encounter corruption in
every form, gigantic prejudices, and the darkness
of ignorance among the great mass of the pee-"-
ple : The rays of reason have however glorious
ly broke in upon their minds, the night is far
spent, and the day is at hand," and we doubt
not that the time is not far distant when with one
voice the worid shall proclaim, that tyranny '
shall be no longer !
Tentanda via tjl. ' \
The commercial enterprizesof the Americans have been crown
ed with a fuccels unequalled, but by the unexampled boldnefsand
originality which charafterifed their formation. Every thing,
therefore, which affymes the least countenance of practicability,
may very properly be unfolded to speculation. It is a known
fa6t, that the populous city of Constantinople derives its subsistence
by the way of the Archipelago : this, during a war with a mari.
time power, renders a supply precarious and contingent. A
eminent writer, thoroughly conversant in the polity of the Turks,
relates, that during the whole of a former war, " neutral velfcls
br.ly were employed in carrying corn on the Grand Seignior's ac
count; and the Porte'gave the French a preference'very profitable
to their merchants. I mult not omit (fays he) to mention in this

The cases demanding such convocation of the

Such impeachments being determined by a Am
