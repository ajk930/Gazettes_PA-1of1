SONNET,
NATURE, fwcct mistress of the pensive iniod !
As on the sandy shore I muting (land,
And fee around the wonders of thy hand,
I feel each paflion soothedâeach sense refin'd.
The icy plains above the whispering tide,
The dreary woods that bound th' cxtenfive view,
The light blue clouds that Sol's pale lustre hide,
Vary thy charms, and every charm renew.
Thee, when young Spring sports on the spangled green;
When Summer bltifhcs in her rosy bowers ;
When welcome Autumn yellow plenty (bowers;
Or Winter storms amid the altered scene ;
Still let me loveâstill woo thee to my arms,
For Peace and Virtue bless the Heart that Nature charms.

MR. FEN NO,
THERE lately appeared in one of the newspa
pers of this city, a translation from a French
paper, which quotes the speech of a Mr. lfnard,
one of the National .Assembly. That gentleman
calls priests monlters, cowards, traitors, murder
ers, and many other names of hatred and re
proach. It may be that such names are applica
ble to the priests in Franceâthough it is to be
presumed that such a general charge on a whole
order of men is as falfe as it is illiberal. It may
be too, that such charges against the priests are
favorably received by the public of France.
Without presuming to decide on either of these
opinions, we know that these rude imputations
on the virtue and public spirit of the clergy are
shocking to an American ear : they tend to in
spire youth with irreverence towards an order of
men, whose lives and labors are devoted to the
imprefling an early love of virtue. The mifchief
of such sentiments is not to be questioned. Their
cruelty is abominable. Our clergy are exel jded
either by law or the general opinion from poli
tical concerns.
Men who do not engage in atflive life, because
it is thought inconfillent with the duties of their
calling to do to, may be fcid to live under the
protection of the general opinion, which in some
measure indemnifies the clergy, by the tefpedt
that is deservedly paid them for their exclusion
from gainful and honorary pursuits. The base
and ungenerous only will offer to dilturb this (late
of things. Accordingly it has been for a century
pad a (landing theme of profligate wit to inveigh
against the clergy.
No one will doubt that the world is the better
for the cftndant and zealous efforts of an order
of men who are geuerally poflefled of goodfenfe
and learning, and whose moral; are exemplary.
Their influence over the mind is that of virtue.
They are so many millionaries scattered over the
couutry, and engaged in diffuling the love of vir
tue and learning, and difcouutetianciug vice and
365

ignorance. Their zeal for the canfe of the coun
try,during the revolution, was eminent âInflead
therefore of calling our clergy by the reproach
ful names which M. Ifnnrd has bestowed on ttie
French priells, they justly merit the title oi the
patrons of learning, examples of virtue, and
friends of good order and their country.
FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER.
MR. DUNLAP,
WHISKY* is a champion against: liberty and
for government. 1 am point blank the
other wayâl am for liberty,Jaut for liberty where
it ought to beâin the government itfelf. I fay,
fir, 1 am for a free government âone that is free
to do what it pleases. I want no other article.
I am for a simple government, as well as a free
one. For whom, pray, was liberty intended, if
not for the government and thofc in it ! Was ic
for Tom, Dick, and Harry, fellows that would
lay out their money in grog, lather than give
it to their betters of taste to I'pend in Claret and
Conftantia ? Was it for the people in a body i
Such an absurd idea was exploded many years
ago, and would, happily for the quiet of the
world, never have returned, but for the upftarc
people of America, and the mad democrats of
France. Thanks, however, to certain patriotic
writers among us ! things begin to be better un
derstood : Ourrulers are apt scholarsâthey make
rapid progress in the knowledge of their rights ;
and let me alone for defending them. 1 will
quickly teach the gentry who rail against specu
lationâagainst the bankâagainst corruption, &c.
what it is to live in a free country ; âthat is, a
country where the government is free. Freedom
would be a poor thing, if thole who enjoy it were
to get nothing by it. Upon this principle, if the
members of the government speculate, they are
right. They have the best opportunity. It they
take fliares in the Bank, and double their money,
1 alkâwho so fit to gather the fruit as those who
planted the tree ?âThey are not to blame : they
rather deserve praise for allowing so large a share
of the benefit to their friends. As to corruption,
that remains to be proved ; âand if proved, what
then ? The left government in the world is said to
be carried on chiefly in this way. In short, a free
government ought to be free in all reJpeCis, and
particularly, from being censured. This, I will
maintain, against Whisky or any body elle.â
And, I hereby give notice, that I am ready to
blow out the brains of him, or any of his coadju
tors, who shall hereafter dare to speak of any
other liberty, than the libertyof the government
to do what it pleases. GUNPOVVDEIi.

Extract of a letter from a gentleman rn the country to his Jriend in Phi-
ladelphia.
" T REGRET, with you, that the newspapers fhouM in any irr-
X stance be ihe vehicles of irreligion and profanetitfs. I
have observed, upon several occasions, that some pieccs of very ah
furd nonsense and infidelity have been retailed, thiough thatchau
nel, to i he great injury of those fuperficial readers, who derive the
grcateft part of their knowledge, both in politics and religion, from
this source. It is to be lamented verv much, that any editor of
a periodical paper, should appear intent upon difleminating prin
ciples of infidelity through the United States, and lor this pur
pole, should fluff his papers with such things from time to lime ;
and it is rather surprizing that those itnpoiuion* (hould be copied
into other papers, as if they merited a second publication.
A pafTage in a certain Gazette, of Dec. 8, ult. which I noticed
amongst other ttafh of a similar kind, in the papers which you
sent me, is a gross imposition as to its original, and a giols insult,
not only upon the Eflablifhed Church in Scotland, but also upoa
mofl of the Proteftani Churches, which generally ague in the par
ticular do&rines reprobated so much in that paper. It is pretend
ed, I observe, that the piece alluded to is a translation from French
Letters, dedicated to the National Assembly ; whereas the tadl is,
t'.iat it is taken from a publication Edinburgh, and has been there
solidly refuted, and at greater length than I think it deserves ; the
misrepresentations being very groli, and the affertior.s, a* to iatts,
perfectly falfe, and indeed, m some tilings, diie&ly the reverfc of
what is there fuggefled. It would not be difficult to txpofe such
fcun ility and impudence in its proper deformity : yet I think the
newspaper is not the most propei place for such exnitmions.
Indeed I cannot but wonder at the indifcietion and afcfurdity
of publishing reflections against religion, or particular systems ot
it, iii a newspaper. Such morceaus ol impiety to be pub
liHicd by themselves, and fold as choice communications front
Pandemonium ; and then their merit will be determined by the
public, and they who approve them, will have the pleafureol pc
rufing them, and the benefit of preserving them. But to publiA*
such things in a Gazette, where we are looking for political infor
mation, 1 s cramming impiety down our throats, whether we will
or not. I hope the generality of your editors of newfpapu* wilt
condu& their papers with superior propriety and decorum, and
let any Gazette, rewatkable for the contrary, have ihr single and
undivided honor of being the xepofitory of profanoicfs and irie-
I igi OH,"
A CITIZEN.CONGRESS.
PHILADELPHIA
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
TUESDAY. February 7.
In committee bf the whole, on the Fijhery Bill.
(Condujion of Mr. Pacj'j Speech.)
THE framers of the conflitution guarded so
much against a possibility of such partial
preferences as might be given if Congress had
the right to grant them, that even to encourage
learning and ufeful arts, the granting of patent;
is the extent of their power : and surely nothing
could be less dangerous to'the sovereignty or in
tereft of the individual dates than the encourage
ment which might be given to ingenious invent
ors or promoter* of valuable inventions in th<
arts and sciencesâthe encouragement which the
general government might give to the fine arts
to commerce, to manufa<ftures and agriculture
might, if judiciously applied, redound to the ho
nor of Congress, and the splendor, magnificenci
and real advantage of the United States : butthf
wife framers of our constitution saw that if Con
grefs had the power of exerting what has beer
called a royal munificence for these purposes
Congress might, like many royal benefacTtors
misplace their munificence, might elevate fycho
phants, and be inattentive to men unfriendly tc
the views of government ; might reward the in
genuity of the citizens of one ltate,and negle<ft s
much greater genius of anotherâa citizen of 1
powerful state it might be said, was attended to
â whilst that of one of less weight in the federai
scale was totally neglected. It is not fufficieni
to remove these objections, to fay as some gen
tlemen have fadd, that Congress is incapable ol
partiality or absurdities, and that they areas fai
from committing them as my colleagues or my
f" e lfâl tell them the constitution was formed or
a supposition of human frailty, and to reftrair
abuses of mistaken powers : the constitution has
been said by some one to be like answers of the
oraclesof old, capable of various and opposite con
ftnitftions, that it has been ingeniously contrived
like some of them to suit two events, a republi
can or a monarchical iflue ; I will not pretend
to fjiy that this is not in some instances too just
an obferration, nor will I undertake to deny that
it was not the intention of some of the conven
tion that such ambiguities might be in their con
stitution, to correspond with the critical and am
biguous state of the American mind, refpecfing
, government ; but I will boldly affirm, that what
ever the theories of that day might lead some tc
think, refpedling the application of monarchical
principles to the govern ment of the United States
no one can at this day pretend that they are ap
piicable to their circuinftances, their disposition!
or interests, or even are agreeable to the wifties
of the people. Even before the adoption of the
conflitution when the rights of men had not beer
so thoroughly investigated as they since have
been, it must be remembered, that whole states
and large and refpecftable minorities in other
states, complained of and objected to the arifto
cratical and monarchical features of the new go
vernment. In vain did the friends of the new
government, friends of order, of union, or oi
liberty, contend that the powers granted by the
constitution, which appeared so alarming, were
such as would never be exerted but when all good
men would acknowledge the neceflity ofexercif
ing them, and that indeed they would be explain
ed or restrained by some future amendments
the sagacious and eloquent Henrvfhook his head
at such promises, sighed and submitted to the
will of the majority, a small one indeed, but
sot etoid from his knowledge of the human heart
what would be done and said in just ification of
every measure which might extend the power of
Congress.
Is it politic and wife then, Mr. Chairman to
exert the power contended for, even if it be'au
thorifed by the constitution ? May not the inter
ference of Congress in the bnfinefs of regulation
the trade of the eastern states excite, if not envy
on account of a fnppofed partiality, a jealonfy
Jelt Congress undertake to intermeddle in the
commercial regulations of other states ? Mav not
Congress with equal propriety undertake to re
gulate the tobacco, the rice and indigo trade a<
well as that of the fisheries ? If they intermeddle
in the buunefs of Tailors, why not in that of ma
nufatfturers and farmers ? Where 1 may ask wirh
my colleague may they not go on in their zeal
and J will add, in their laudable pursuit of pro'
.noun- the general welfare ; and how tot'rlh
may they be mistaken ? If jealonfy of rival (tare*.
*nftead of mutual fatisfaction and pleasureâi'
diftrnft and suspicion of Congress, instead of
confidence in their measures, be the consequence,
how will the union be promoted, or the general
government fecnred ? However virtuously dis
posed the present members may be, and I am,
ready to applaud their honed intentions, let them
consider, Sir, that they had better suppress their
patriotic emotions, than give a pretext for their
( ncceffors to abuse the powers which they now
wi(h to exert for the public good : I know they
will quote the opinion of as wife and virtuous a
citizen as is in the United States : I know his pa
triotism, and know well his true republican prin
ciples ; but Sir, with the freedom of a fellow ci
tizen, I take the liberty of faying that his honest
zeal, like that of the friends of The bill, has led
| bim into a mistake.* That able statesman and
virtuous citizen, like the eloquent advocates of
the bill, has considered the aiSs now quoted, as
a full fantftion for the one before the committee :
but I am of opinion that those atfs had better be
repealed, than give a fantfion to the enarting of
a law which goes to the establishing of bounties,
or drawbacks, or by whatever other name they
be called, which may be nfed to the partial en
couragement of any branch of trade or employ,
ment whatsoever. I (hall therefore vote against
the bill before us, and to get rid of it, (hall vote
for striking out of it the lit feclion according to
the motion now before the committee. As a
member of this House I lliall think it my duty to
protedl the fifheries, and every other branch of
our commerce, the fifhermen as well as every o
ther citizen, as far as may be within my ability ;
but I am not permitted, as a member of Congress,
I humbly conceive, to felettthe fifheries and fifh
ermen as objects of more consequence than any
other branches of trade, or persons employed in
them, left Congress fhouid not only shew a mif
raken attachment, or even if judiciously placed,
excite jealousies and discontents between the
states, and diflruft deftrucftive of their weight
and influence. My constant wish has been to "fee
Congress confined to such acfts as would form a
more perfect union, promote the general wel
fare, insure domestic tranquility, and engage the
confidence of our fellow citizens.
My wish is, that the members of Congress
would leave their refpedtive states in the full en
joyment of every right and privilege they held
before their adoption of the new constitution,
which can be exercised without prejudice to the
general government. Let the legislatures of the
different states encourage as far as in their pow
er, the commerce, agriculture or manufactures
of their refpedtive states ; and let Congress, as
far as can be consistent with the most steady im
partiality, patronize their patriotic exertions by
wife regulations of their commerce with foreign
nations, such as may open as full an intercourse
with those nations as the states may desire. The
emulation of the filter states in commerce, ma
nufactures or agriculture, would lead to the ear
ly eftablifhtnent of that branch of either to which
each state might be best adapted : this rival, .ip
could produce no jealousy, no general national
discontent in the states, 110 localities inCongrefs.
Virginia would not attempt to rival Maflachu
ietts in her fifhei ies or carryingbufiuefs, nor will
South Carolina and Georgia rival the manufac
tories of Jersey and Pennsylvania : each state
may rejoice to fee its filter dates enjoyin<r the
advantages with which Heaven has blefled the n :
and Congress, if confined to fubjedts which admit
not of local considerations, may debate with tem
per and decide with unbiafled judgment. I con
fefs I have wished that Congress pofleffbd the
power that the friends of the bill tell us we do
possess, and tell us we have exerted : but on ex
amining the constitution with a view to my wish,
I I found reason to think, not only that Congress
has not that power, but that it ought not to pof
:r > "nlefs the constitution was intended to
eltablifh a consolidated government on the ruin
ol the State legiflaftures : but this I conceive can
not be the cafe, because the constitution guaran
tees to the states their relpedtive republican go
vernments. The general powers ofCongref* no
doubt ought to be (as they are) adequate to the
pnrpofe of forming n moreperfett union than fub
hlled under the confederation, to establish jus
tice, &c. &c. but as they are bound to guarantee
to the states, their refpedtive republican forms
or government, I cannot conceive how any of
tjiele powers can be employed (confiftentl v with
the ends for which they were given) in diminish
ing the power and sovereignty of the state legis
latures. How Congress can interfere in the 're
gulations refpeoting the merchants and their sai
lors at Marblehead. with more propriety than
with thofeat Philadelphia, Norfolk or Charles
ton, I cannot conceive : nor how this interfer
ence could take place without alarming thele
Hates, I know not. Viewing the bill before us
in this light, Mr. Chairman, I fliall vote against
it, and, as I said before, to get rid of it, ffiafi vote
to strike out the firft fedtion according to the
motion now before the committee.

A WORD TO THE WISE
THE Legislatures of Tome of the States claim
a right toinftrurt their Senators in Congress.
But have thev well considered whether this claim
is warranted by the Conltitution, or compatible
â with the duty which their Senators owe to the
Union ? And if it is not, whether it is conli(lent
â with the public good, or their own dignitv, to
attempt to exercise it ?
The Constitution authorizes the State Legisla
tures to choole Senators forCongrefsâ& this they
ought seasonably to doâbut it gives them no au
thority to inftrurt them after they are chosen ;
and the nature of their trust feenis to forbid it:â
for it is their duty, on mature deliberation and
confutation, when afl'embled, to art what they
111 all judge 111 oft for the good of the United States
in general ; and their deliberations ought to be
free and unbiased. By the Constitution, each
House has authority to determine the rules of its
own proceedings; but they are required to pub
]i(h their journals, except such parts as in their
opinion require fecrefv, and this their conftitn
enrs have a right to expert ; âbut whether their
debates (hall be public or private, is a matter of
expediency, of which they alone are the proper
j llcl g es - A CITIZEN.

MR. FEN NO,
"P HE . ,etrer " wnter in yÂ° ur appears to
4 think that the portage on newspapers will
r'-ij-'--- lie circulation of those important vehicles
â  > laiion. That the portage proposed is too
ii . h, <â ( mains to be provedâif it should have the
si r ,â¢ ehended by this writer, it certainlyis;
but e eii with this charge, I conceive that the
probability is, that the circulation will be en
creafedâand surely thereby the business is put
on a better footing than it ever has been hereto
fore. The exchange papers of the printers are
to go free in the mail, and the printers may make
their contracts as usualâwhile by the law they
acquire bright to transmit them by the mail to
their fubl'cribers, they paying the portage, which
it is probable the subscribers will da with chear
fulnefs, if they can by that means receive their
papers with certainty and punctuality.âOn the
present precarious footing of the business, it is
demonstrable that the circulation of newspapers
would very soon come to an end.âThere is now
a bill before Congress for reducing the rate of
portage on newspapersâand nothing ftiort of a
convitfion that the reduction will defeat the ob
jetl which every member appears to have at
heart, viz. a rteady and puntfiual tranfmiflion and
reception of the papers, will prevent the dimi
nution. The poilnge rauli be adequate to de
fraying the expenceâany thing ftiort of that,
will disappoint the public expectation. '

On the trial of Borrett for counterfeiting the
stamp of the Goldsmith's Company, a ciicum
ftante happened which is worthy notice. Before
the jury were charged, his attorney conferred
with him for some time at the bar, and on his
return it appeared that the wife of Mr. Borrett
had the preceding evening been delivered of
twins.
Mr. Attorney General, who attended to con
du<fi the prosecution, upon being informed of
this fart, immediately addrefled himfelf to the
court, and with generous humanity as great, as
noble, as exalted as everglowed within the brea(t
of man, consented not only that the trial ihould
be deferred tUJ the next session, but that if the
prisoner could find such bail as the court should
be pleased to direift, he was willing that he should
be discharged, in order that he might go home
and afford'comfort to his wife.
Four gentlemen of fortune who were in court,
to whom the prisoner was known, iminediarely
offerer! to become his bail, and on their enterino
iiito a recognizance for his appearance, he vvaf
discharged.

describe the Â»xq- ifire sensibility with which this
unparalleled liberality of Mr. Attorney General
seemed to touch every heart.

Ry London papers as lale as the 10th of January, we learn
That all the German princes are declared enemies to France, who
lhould after the 15th of January countenance the aflembing and
arming of the French emigrants. An oath was preparing at Cob-
It ntz, to be taken by all the French emigrants, the substance of
which was, fidelity to the princes, and " an entire devotion to their
orders, for the glory and interest of France."âGreat preparations
lor war were making throughout Francp.
The magistracy of Worms had written refpeftfully to the King
of France, that they had ever confidercd the reception of the emi
grants among them only as an ast of common hospitality but
! left his Majesty lhould take it in ill part, they had given orders'
to the Prince of Conde to quit Worms with all his retinue of dif
affected adherents. The Prince Biftiop of Liege is amongst the
most strenuous supporters of the Ex-Princes, supplying them with
every necessary foi war, and promising still more. The govern
ment of the Liegiois had forbid the sale of Montesquieu's Spirit of
laws, and Voltaire's questions on the EncyclopediaâAlltheemi- I
grants in that State were ordered to be equipped by the loih of
January. His Holiness the Pope has been very ill of an apoplec
tic fit, but was recoveringâOn the 26th of December, a letter
was received at Coblentz from the Emperor to the French Princes
" he allured them of his most ample assistanceâand that he had'
given orders to Gen. Bender to line the frontier" ; the authenti
city of the letter was however fufpefted.
A drift look-out was kept in the channel for the (Britifhl Swal
low packet, from India, which il was supposed would bring the
moll important accounts ever received from that country ; it be
ing expe&ed in England the preferit campaign would determine
the fate ol Seringapatam and the Mysore country, Lord Cornwal
l's army, and the whole ol the Englilh tertitoty on Coromandel
coalt The French emigrants at Coblenn weie â¢ preparing to re
t ire toHanau and the Maigi aviate of Anfpach but that the emperor's

ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS.
That the circumstances of the United States have been amelio
rated by the operation of the general government, is so abun
dantly evident, that it mud be pcrfeftly astonishing to those who"
compare the past with the present fnuation of our country to hear
any complaints of its admir.iftrafion ; fads are continually occur
ing in relpeft to particular States to prove the truth of the above
remark, and with refpett to the union there is a perfeÂ£l renova
tion. The State ol Maflachufetts from being grievoudy oppressed
with taxes, is now so relieved from public burthens as to fupercede
for the current year, any imposition whatever: before the late
war, the finances of that State were in so eligible a si. nation, that
the government commanded the money of its citizens at a much
lower, than the the legal and current rate of intercil ; from pre
<ctu appearances it is very probable that their public credit will
very shortly be equally favorably circumstanced. The fituaiion
ot other States admits of similar observations.
Can it be poilibiy conceived then that a government which in
its operations has produced such effects fliould be unpopular ? All
our fenus contradict the fuppofitioriâ and he that hath eves to
ec, ears to hear, an heaitto feel, and an head to undei stand, hath
all tnefe teftifying continually in favor of the general government
May the State governments be for ever dear to the people â¢ bnt
may they n; ver be gu.ilty of such ingratitude to heaven, as to de
ny the merits of the general government.

THAT elegant SEAT at the Falls of Delaware, in the vicinity
of Trenton, in Nc. w-Jei icy, occupied for many years past by
the fubferiber; containing upwards ot 200 acres ot land, beside.v
a of wood-land of about 185 acres, at the distance of two
miles. The farm is divided by the main ftrect leading from
Trenton to Lamberion, and Philadelphia, into two parts, nearly
equal in quantity ; the eaftwardly part being arable land, is laid
ctf in convenient fields, and in good farming order. The other
part, bounded by the said ftrect on the east, and by the river on
the weft, forms a fquaÂ»e; which, from the combined effect of situ
ation and improvement, is generally allowed to be one of the moil
beautiful and defuable feats in the state. The mansion-house is a
handsome, well-fiuifhed brick building, 50 by 40, containing four
rooms on each floor, with excellent cellars, and a two story brick,
kitchen ; and commanding a very extensive and pleasing v:ew of
the river, both above and below, as well as including the lalls, and
also of Trenton and the neighbouring feats and improvements on
both fides of the river. Among the out-buildings are 3 new stone
coaeh-houfe and stables, fuflkientto contain fix carriages and ten
horses, accommodated with a cutting and feeding room, and a ca
pacious loft for hay ; adjoining these is a very complete granary,
rat proof, and a stone cow-house, upwards of 100 feet in length,
containing thirty-one paved flails, over which is a roomy loft for
hay, See. Adjoining the court-yard of the mansion-house, is a gar
den of about two acres, extending towards the river, in the highest
state of culture, and abounding with a rich collc&ion ot the
choicest fruits of almost every kind, and several large asparagus
beds, highly manured. At a convenient distance from the man
sion-house, and nearly in the centre of the square, is a new, well
built, stone farm-houfe, accommodated with a large cheese-room,
spring-house, garden, Sec. a complete stone smoke-house, corn
cribs, waggon-house, a capacious ice-house, and every other ne
ceflary out-building. The ground is properly divided into small
fields, all well watered, highly improved, and chicflvunder the
most approved grass. This square has produced annually, for se
veral years past, upwards of sixty tons of the best hay, besides
supporting through the summer season twentv to thirty horned
cattle, and eight or ten horses. It contains also two bearing or-
chards of good fruit. The river abounds, in the proper seasons,
with great plenty of all kinds of fi(h usually found in lrefh water
in this climate, and with a variety of wild-fowl ; both of which
may afford a pleafmg amusement to the fpfcrtfman, as weil as a
convenient additioft to the elegance and variety of his table. The
whole of the land, except the wood-land, is inclosed and divided
by good fences, great part of which is formed of red cedar ports,
and rails of chefnut and white cedar. The purchaser may have
the improved square separately, or the whole together, as may
best suit him. There is an inexhaustible quantity of good build
ing stone on the river shore. The purchase money, if well secured,
and the interest punctually paid, will not be demanded for many
) ears.
Any pei ton desirous of viewing the piemifis, may be gratified

or Mr. Inallman, who at present occupies the iarm-houle and
part of the landâand may know the price on application to the
