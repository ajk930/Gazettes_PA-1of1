LONDON, Nov. 3
One circumstance relating to the
Chinese Embafly is worthy of re
maik.âlt is enatfted by the laws of
China, that if any native (hall pre
futne to interfere in any manner
whatever in the politics of Europe,
with respeCt to (.hina, he (ball in
stantly undergo a capital puni(h
ment ; for which reason the Chi
nese Missionaries, who are to accom

to render rhemlelres obnoxious to
the laws of their country, by writ
ing, with their own hands the fair
copy of the translation of the letter
intended to be prefeuted by our
court to the Emperor of China,

a considerable embarraflment, from
which, however, they were at length

What fort of Republic shall France
ejiablifh ?
Thisqueflion, toadopt the French
Anglicil'm, is the order of the Day.
It is a great queltion upon which
the two parties in the Convention
are now at ilfue. M. Chabot is the
warm advocate for a federative Re
public, or, as lie calls it, a govern
ment of Municipalities. By this
scheme he proposes that there (hould
be about 80,000 diltinCt govern
ments in France,each of them forin
irg a Municipality without any
check or control in its own district,
but the whole to be represented in
National Convention by a Congress,
who (hould have the general lcgifla
tive power, the levying of taxes, the
declaration of defenfive war,&c.&c.
The scheme of a federative Repub
lic has hitherto made few proielites.
The arguments advanced againfl it
are llrong, and indeed nnanfwera
ble. A federation, fay they,refults
from the union of nations or pro
vinces frparately feeble ; but who
e>er thought of difmembei ing one
strong nauon, and dividing it into
chequers to preserve its unity ? All
federative governments have bro't
into conjunction their diftridt inter
ests, genius, manners, nfages, and
generally their modes of legidaiion
and administration. lis imperfecti
on confilts therefore in its hetero
geneous particles.âlt is not an en
tire fnfion of one jet, it is an amal
gam.â It is not one force, it is the
junction of several forces.â It is not
a (iinple, but a compound machine,
and the action of the wheels and
movements not being uniform,
inftanraneous and voluntary, as
must necefl'arily arise frcm unequal
265-
powers and efforts,it cannot be com
pared to the simple frame, and re
gular operation of a single state,
where all the atftions are produced
by one central spring, and where
all the powers and willies are unit
ed, and, if I may use the expression,
twilled together.
â  One of the grandest ideas that lias
been executed by men, is the over
throw of the provinces of France,
and the creation of departments.
This superb division of a country,
does honor to the eighteenth centu
ry and to the French people. By
what blindness do we now propole
to re-ascend to provinces .'
All this is the mere ephemoraj
projedt of some disturbers, who yet
hope to diftraft the people from the
true objetfts of their contemplation.
But we do not fee any hazard of the
concutfion of parties coming to an
explosion. We find the following
article in Condorcet's report of the
proceedings of the Convention. It
is interesting, because it follows the
insinuation which he threw out on
Â£.9,811,805
Brifldt's party.
" On the march that the Conven
tion (hall pursue ; if we may be al
lowed to anticipate its future by the
picture of its present condu<s, and
by the public opinion, the result of
their deliberations will be good and
peaceful. The Convention will not
offer to the people the afflicting
fpediacle of iiiteltine divisions, as
they have no longer contending in
terests to combat, and as there no
longer exiits any dangerous chiefs
in power, in fortune, in credit, a
round whom the malcontents crthe
ill-intentioned might rally thetn
felves. Enmities,proscriptions, and
particular paifions will not form
what is called parties. There may
be disputes, but there cannot be di
visions. In a word, the genius of
the Convention is good ; but the
public opinion which observe* it,
and which will have influence in
I'pite of the Convention, is ftrll bet
ter, and the men, gifted with some
talents, and with true force of cha
racter, the only men who are pro
per to influence the delHny of the
Republic, know well that the only
glory that they can obtain is that
attached to the title of a good citi
zen, and that all which has the air
of party, will neceflarily disappear
as a vain phantom before the intel
ligence and the power of the peo
ple."
It is impoflible to travel far in lhis
country without being powerfully
(truck by the unequivocal marks of
great and unexampled prosperity
which every where prefeut them
selves. Habitations comfortable &
neat are every where riling up,
where before was barren solitude ;
hamlets are rising into villages, Til
lages into towns, towns into cities,
where there is the Itnalleft impulle
of the manufacturing fpirir, or that
of commerce, into fonicthing that
would bid lair to rival the metro
polis, had not that wonderfi'l body
iifelf ir.creafed for years part with
a rapidity beyond them all. Yet
the government wants reforming,
we ate told. In a garden where
every plant flourifbes, and the pro
duce exceeds calculation, and even
imagination, who will be perfuafled
i hat there is gross mismanagement ?

SATURDAY, January J.
do (I TIPHTATroN OF THE
DEBATE oh MR. STEELE'S MOTION,
For reducing tlie Army.
MR. MURRAY said at so late a ftagc of
the debate it would be improper to de
tain the committee; and had he heard one
position of the gentleman from North-Caro-
Una attended to by any other, lie would have
held bim'elf inexcusable in calling the atten
tion of the committee to its refutationâex
cept tl* ealculatiorrsCTterert into by the gen
tleman from Noftli-Carolina, and Â®ifwÂ«!ed
by those of the gentleman from Connecticut,
which were all irrelative to the point in ifl\ie,
[ he had heard but one-new poistion advanteil
1 on this fobjeft which had been so amply dif
j cuifed by every member, for at least thtee
I weeks last session. The position te which he
I alluded was as long as one efta
| blifhmenrwas kept up in or.e coi;ccntercd
point, there the Indian i would concentre, ajiri
thence is deduced the conclusion that the
great combination of the fav ages was a c4i.-
sequence of the ar my which we kept up. On
this reasoning much ftrel's had been laid 'by
that gentleman, and by molt who had ftlp
ported Iris motionâand they agteed that by
diminifhiirg our eftabiifhment and difiufing
our material] of defence, the Indians would
be disjointed and cease their combined ope
rations.â Nothing he conceived could be
more fallacious than any reasoning which mil
took effects for causes. He would observe,
and the gentleman must admit, that the mode
of our defence had been a ccnfequence of the
operation of the lavages and not a cattfe cf
their combination.âThe history of Indian
warfare from Braddock's defeat up to the
year eighty-four could furnifli little matter
of instruction on the prelent situation of things
âbefore that period no cause existed that
could forcibly attract the savages to a eenter,
or give aftivitv or duration to their combi
nations m great numbers. âBut since the re.
volution a cause did exist in the neighbour
hood of the present scene of operation, over
which we toave no controiil, and whioh he had
no fort of doubt had produced the effects a -
gainst which tile eftablifoment is to ast â
That cause, which it was bnneceffary but to
allude to, had undoubtedly planned the mek
furesâinfpii'ed the hoililityâand provided
the means of Indian warfare { it had organ
ized a set of tribes hitherto dispersed in'
action, or had given a formidable method to
those who some years since were without
method, andjwhoonly up a kind of incuY
ftve war, and a running fire along the fron
tier.âln these times the mode of defence
was accommodated to the mode of offence ;
and when no well organized attack was made,
less (kill and combination of defence were re
quifite âBut now the policy of another pow
er gives energy and system to the tribes*â it
concentres thole powers which were dispersed,
and gives permanency to what was before
temporary and inconstant; our mode of de
fence opposed fyflem to f) Itemâand perma
nent defence to the appearances of perma
nent combinations. Militia woodsmen would
do in the old incurfive war, but w ere unfit
for that fort of war that acted against hosti
lities which were permanent and organizedâ
for these garrisons uniting the allurements of
traffic with the refpeliability of arms were
necefTaryâand woodsmen who could not
leave their families for more than a mere ex
cuifion of forty days were not proper. "While
he was up he would remark that what ever
had been said of (landing armies, though per
fectly true abftrattedly taken, did in no point
touch on the present queition.âWe are in a
state of war, and have an army and mult
havi one; there was no more resemblance
between a Handing army and an army, as is
ours, raised for adtual defence, than there i*.
between a cadelion and an owlâthe one a
thing of ill omen and uiineceffary but for
works of darkness ; the other a creature that
took its complexion from the moment.âA
Handing army exists beyond the laws of rea
sonable necefuty ; our eftabliihment was dic
tated by absolute neceflity, is lioiitted in num
bers and duration, and is in all refpedts con
lidered but as the engine of protection against
the hostile Indians. Those, he observed, who
supported the resolution had a great advan
tage over its oppnfers, in the freedom with
which they could attack a fyfteni which was
formed partly from public and partly from
confidential irformation. In detenditig this
fyfteia tlje- ep:"ly he felt himiVlf trammeled
c-~ ;
'-*â  vperpetually by a natural tendency to use those
argument? in its support which he had drawn
from confidential sources #f information last
session; while the doors were (hut âbut felt
the propriety of retraining that impulle, and
would only call on members to recollect the
view the fubjeft had been held in at a time
when all the information was a fair source of
debate- He hoped that as there certainly
now was no profpeft of peace in che spring,
and as the President had the power to derive
every advantage from the employment of
expert woodsmen under the law past last ses
sion, that the resolution would not be agreed
ts.
Mr. Williamfon did not entirely approve of
the motiori in it* present form; the blanks
might be so filled, he thought, as to import a
thing opposite to his wilhesâthey night im
port a discharge of the troops already raised.
He believed his colleagae had no such desire;
he thought the measure would be improper,
but he wilhed not to have a regiment of offi
cers without soldiersâhe wished to fix a time
at which the recruiting service fiiould cease,
and the fiipernumerary officers (hould be dis
charged. As he intended to move that the
proposition might be To amended, he should
consider it in that ligbt-Â«-and he believed the
measure would not be imprudent nor incon
sistent with the molt vigorous meafmes of
defence or offence.
It Ihould/be remembered that the House of
Representatives, when they had the bill be
fore them which last winter pafl'ed into a law
' for defending the frontiers, sent it to the se
nate with a clause importing that officers be
low the rank of field officers, lhould not be
put into cominiflion any fafter than troops
could be enlisted. The Senate adhering to
their privilege, refuted to agree to that claule
in the bill, and it became necessary immedi
ately to commiflioH the officers for jooo men,
some of whom, if fame speaks truth, not co
vetous of honor, are content with their payj
without having raised three men. By the
proposed amendment, the officers only would
be dismissed, whom molt of us wilhed never
to liave seen 111 commiflion.
Tile proposed regulation has been ccnfured
as implicating some kind of censure on the ex
ecutive. He viewed it in a different light.â
The executive had done what was proper and
neoelTary at the time. But if it should ap-
pear that other meai'ures would fit the change
of circuniftances, he did not fee why thof'e
measures lhould not be adopted. It should be
recollected that during the last winter, when
the estimate of 5000 men necessary for the
defence of our frontier was handed to Con
grafs, there was no militia law. A well armed
effective militia, that palladium of liberty,
had once and again been recommended by the
President to the attention of Congress : but
Congress, from year to year, as if they wilhed
for a (landing army, had negle&ed the mili
tia. Towards the close of the last session in
deed they pa(Ted a law. He hoped he might
without offence call it the shadow of a Jaw.-â
It was faying in a few words that the several
states might have a good militia if they pleas
ed ; and if they pleased, they might have none
at all. Was the executive to trust the de
fence of a country tp a militia formed under
such a law !âHe thought not âBut he ob
served, that since the last winter it had come
to be generally known, that a class of our fel
low citizens exist on the frontiers, who are at
all times ready to serve, not as drafted mili
tia, but as volunteers. These are the men,
said he, by whom the Indians must be chas
tised, or we shall never have peace. They
are the belt woodsmen and marksmen, and
they have no profefiional interest in spinning
out the war. He said he must repeat the ob
servation, that volunteers of the militia are
the only troops for vigorous offenfive opera
tions. Figure to yourselves an army of re-
gulars creeping through the wiidernefs with
all its cannon and other military apparatus in
chafe of a naked savage, who fees it without
being seen. It is an elephant in chafe of a
wolf! The troops already railed may be
pretty well disciplined before the season for
a&ionâthey are fufficient with the co-opera
tions of the militia, to take a poll,.and build
forts where they pleaseâevery thing else is
beyond their power, if they were not five but
fifteen thousand. They will never fee an In
dian unless he chutes to be seen He wished
to be indulged in a single observation refpeft
-ing a cafe in which it was said the other day,
the militia had been surprised. He was lorry
that his naming Major Adair had produced
the remark ; he would nevertheless venture
to repeat the cafe an instance of vigilante
and bravery. The Major believing there
was an enemy at hand, hadvifited all his pods
at miduight in person ; his Lieutenant, Madi
son, before the dawn of day, routed all the
men, telling them that the Indians weie com
ing. The Major wirtiing to leave the ground
before day-light, called in the sentinels,âbut
the Indians -rushing in with them, gave a
heavy fire before there was light bv which
they could be seen. The Major, he said, had
not the merit, as he believed, of having been
a Continental officer, but had the merit,* not
less honorable, of having served bravely in the
militia. He qeeflionetl on the whole whether
any of the green troops to be recruited next
spring or fmnmer, will make so good a de
fence as Major Adair's militia had made
They had taken scalp for scalp, though they
fought agaii.ft theodds.of three to one. He
prayed it might be remembered, that his ideas
were not founded on any hopes of sudden peace
with the Indians; on the contrary, every mo
tion of the Indians, and everv measure taken
by those who had most influence over the In
dians, induced him to jegard an Indian war
as the perpetual tax of at least one million per
anuum. It is fortunate, as he conceived,
that the United States know the source of
their misfortunesâand if they are compelled
to ipend'one million per annum iu oppofmg a
furag# enemy who seems to be bunted upon
them, perhaps they may 'be taught to indem
nify themselves by refufing to expeod several
millions which they can ealily faye. If a per
petual tax on this bead nrnlt be reifed, found
policy will readily point to the proper objeÂ£fc
of taxation : but this mult remain over for
our futceflors. In the meaiÂ» time, believing
that the troops already rai ed are fufficient to
maintain every fort that is or maybe erected,
and being confident that; volunteers nrAy be
found at any time fufficient, if it lhall b$ ne
cefTary, to extirpate every hostile tribe of In
diansâhe /houlci vote for the proportion with
the proposed amendment.
.Mr. Wadfworth closed the debate by reply
ing particularly to that part of Mr.
speech, in which he controverted ion re of
Mr. NVadfworth's ftateinent.
Mr. Wadfworth (aid, in the Act of May
2d, 1792, 600,500 dollars were appropriated
for various purposes, of which 70,000 dollars
were for the quarter matter's department,
which sum added to jo ( ooo, appropriated by
the ast of December 24, 1791, make the 120
thou'and dollars as he had before statedânot
finding the estimates in the Clerk's office, on
which these appropriations were made.âl
went, said Mr. Wadfworth, to the War-Of
fice, and took copies of both estimates, which
I have in my handâand there can be no doubt
of the fact, as it has been ftatid by me. Mr.
' Wadfworth added some general remarks re
fpefling militia and regular troopsâthe me
rits of the former, he never meant to depre
ciate âhe had lieen witness to many brilliant
aftidns in which they had been engaged. On
the present occasion, his wifli was to impress
on the house the fnpenority of a regular cfta
blilhed force for the lervice now under confi
de ratipn. ,

Resolved, as the opinion of this committee,
That the prayer of the memorjaliftfcis reasona
ble, and that provision ought to be made for the
payment of such sums to the original holders of

have been saved by the terms of the loan mide

States, calculating 6 per cent, at 20f. in the
pound, and other species of paper at a propor

al creditor shall have fubferibed to the loan pr li
poid by the ad to provide for the debt of tiile
United States, a sum not less than the funt ori
ginally flipulated, such creditor shall not be en
titled to the beucfit of this provisionâAnd tljat
when a less sum shall have been so fubfeft'bed,
there shall be a proportional redn&ion of his
claim to such benefit.

The committee rose and reported the bill,
which was ordered to be engrofied for a third
reading. â¢*<'.Â»
The House then took into consideration, the
bill to regulate trade and intercourse with the
Indian tribes.
Mr. Madison's amendment, which had been
ordered to be printed, was taken into confedera
tion. It is in the following wordsâviz.
Strike out the eighth Section, in the words following.
" And be it further enabled, That no fa'.eof land,
made by any nation or tribe of Indians 'within the
United States,fhall be valid to any p erf on or pcrfons,
or to any slate, "whether such fate may have the right
of pre-emption of such land or not, unless the fame
shall be made, and duly executed, at some public treaty
held for that purpofc, under the authority of the Uni
ted States
And in lieu thereof insert toe following :
And be it enabled, That no person Jhall be capable
of acquiring any title, in laiv or equity, to any lands
beyond the Indian boundaries, and ivithiu those of the
United States, by purchase, gift or other-wife, from
the Indians, holding or claiming the fame ; and that
it Jhall be a misdemeanor in any person, punifbable by
fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of a jury, to
obtain, accept, or direflly or indircftly, to treat for
any title tofuch lands from the ftid Indians, or any
other for them. And that, ivhete any such Indians
Jhall, of their own accord, desire to fell any part of
their lands, and it Jhall be deemed for the interejl of
the United States, that a pur chafe Jhall be made, the
JameJhall be done no otherioife than by treaty or con
vention , to be entered into pursuant to the conjlitution ;
the lands fopurchafed, to enure to the use of whoever
may have the right of pre-emption thereto, % andJhali
pay the price thereof.
Mr. Madison observed, that misunderstand
ings, quarrels and wars with the Indians had
originated from the circumflance of persons hav
irig obtained, through fraud or other improper
means, possession of the lands belonging to the
Indians. This consideration rendered it highly
important that thre whole business (hould be un
der the absolute and sole dire*stion of the public
authority, in order to guard effe&ually against
the fatal confequenees which may result to the
public by being precipitated into a war, thro*
the arts of unprincipled persons, who while the
public are made to sustain great calamities, often
fin 4 means taextricate themselves from bearing
their proportion of the inconveniences and ex-
pences.
Several alterations were moved and made
in the propefed fe&ionâamong others,
The words " at the discretion of a jury" on
motion of Mr. Livermore, were struck out. The
fame gentleman moved to expunge these words,
" And it {hall be deemed for the interest of the
" United States, that a purchase shall be made."
This motion, after fonie debate, was agreed to.
It was then proposed by Mr. Clark, that the
motion fliould be divided. The firft question
was for Unking out the Bth fe&ion.
Mr. Barnwell obje&ed to striking out. He
conceived that the original fetftion was as com
prehenllve as the other ; that it was better word
ed, and liable to fewer exceptions than thefub
vttitute, as being more definite; for not wit h
flanding the latter is longer, yet sales made pur
suant to treaties held under an authority not ex
plicitly pointed out, would be liable to cavil and
levifion; and the persons holding a treaty for
the purpose of making purchases, are expoied to
incurring the penalty.
Mr. Giles preferred the proposed fiibftitue, if
for no other reason than this, that it contained
a penalty for making improper pur chafes.

Sketch of the Debate on the Rrfnlution, 'r,flWKÂ» f tll
Loan of the Balance: due from lie U.iittd .Stal/t
to the individual States.
After reading the report of ths commillion
ers for fettling th acco'ints, Mr. o:i-Â« m;-!e
some opposition to providing for these balances
before they were ascertained; that is not dons
by the report of the commiflioners.
Mr. Fitzfiinons briefly Hated the motives
which had induced him to come forward with
the resolutions previous to ascertaining the ba
lancesâhe thought that while there was an un
certainty in thebufinefs, the decisions would be
more readily and impartially made.
Mr. Livermore objected to providing for ba
lances before they were known; he thought the
resolutions incomplete, as they recognized only
creditor states, and fay noth ng about debtor dates.
Mr. Fitzfimons said.he did not believe there
would be any debtor states; he was sure there
ought not to be any.
Mr. Madison objected to the resolutions on
the fame principle with Mr. Livermore; he en
larged on the idea, and insisted that without the
most urgent neceflity, the provision contemplat
ed ought not to be made in the present uncer
tain (late of the business. On the principles of
j" ft ice and oeconomy, he contended, that a sys
tem which would be so eomplex in its operation,
ought not to J>e adopted; it would operate to
the extension of taxation in the United States to
ths greatest degree, as it would involve s fur
ther levying of taxes to reimburse theftatesthat
fliall finally appear to have large balances due
them.
Mr. Fitzfimons faicl he was not
adverting to the aÂ«sl for afluming the state debts,
Ke observed that these balances were there re
cognized, and the creditors to whom these ba
lances are due, are to all intents and purpofeg
creditors of the union. Mr. Fitzfimons said, he
had no idea of the result contemplated by the
gentleman in refpe<sl to the extention of taxes
No pofiible difference, he conceived, could take
place whether the balances were now a {Turned,
or the ascertain mem of them was made previous
thereto; the operation would be precisely the
fame in both cases.
Mr. Sedgwick replied to Mr. Madifon âHe
(lated various reasons to shew that his obje&ion
on the score of encreafed taxes had really no
foundation. Mr. Sedgwick entered into a Ihort
difcufiion of the fubje&, and stated the real situ
ation of some of the ftatcs, to whose cicizenÂ»
large funis are due. He said hÂ« had no doubt the
general government would consider themlelvef
bound to pay those demands; could he despair
of the public faith in this refpe&, he fhoulddeÂ£
pair of the common wealth; for he (hould anti
cipate the most pernicious consequences to flow
from the withholding that justice, which those
dates now looked to the general government
to obtain.
Mr. Mercer observed, tliat the honourable
gentleman from PenÂ«fylvania had brought for
ward his proposition in such a (hape, as that it
was difficult to determine what his object- was.;
but he inferred from his explanations, unless he
contradi&ed himfelf. that the real object was a,
further assumption of the state debts, and to ef
fect the adoption of a question which was reje<Â£-.
Ed thelaft session. Here Mr. Mercer entered into
a consideration of the various principles which
had been proposed as bases for fettling-and ad
justing the accounts between the United States
and individual slates. He contended that the bu
fmefs was not in such a state as to juftify adopt
ing the principle of the resolution. He adverted
to the approaching difTolution the prelect
He remarked on the difference of the
exertions which had been made by the fttvcral
states-âhe inferred that there mull necefiarily
be both debtor and creditor Hates; and.hence
deduced various confidernfions which flioulti in
fluence a postponement of thiybufinefs.
Mr. Gerry recurred to the funding; aÂ«% ta
(hew that debtor and creditor state* were there
in recognized â¢ with refp-:& to th? principles
on which the accounts ate to be fettled, tlutbufinefg rests tlie commiffioaers, whole de
cision by a4aw of the government is to be final;
but this he conceived, had nothing to do with
the present proposition. He noticed fevcral other
objections offered by Mr. Mercer, which he
thought appeared to be brought forward merely
to embarrass the business. He observed that the
present proposition was totally different from
that agitated last feflion; that now offered is rea
sonable, is founded on equal principles, and its
Â«ffe& will not be to encreafe the creditors of the
union, nor induce a necessity for one farthing of
taxation, which will not be wanted after the ac
counts are adjusted, and the balances known.
He hoped therefore, that the proposition would
be agreed to.
Mr. B. Bourn supported the resolution, as bÂ«-
ing free from theobje&ionsurged to thofeoffered
the lad session. He noticed the remarks which
had been made on the resources in lands of the
states to whom the balances are supposed to be
due; Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and South
Carolina are the states the mod interested in the
business; those states have no lands. With ref
ped co exertions in the common cause, it will
not be pretended that those states have not made
as great as any in the union. The present pro
position involves this simple enquiry, whether
the United States ihall pay the states as states, or
whether they will pay the individual creditorsâ
justice required, in his opinion, that the latter
oughtto be paid; for their demandsare recogniz
ed by a law of the union, and they are to all in
tents and purposes creditors of the union,as fully
as any description of creditors whatever.
(Debate to be continued.)

Til Mr. Jâ *- B
SIR,
SUCH is the uncertainty in all human affairs,
that however good the cause, however emi
nent the abilities that are engaged in its support,
every wife and refl. Â£king mind will constantly
hold itfetf in a Hate prepared fordifappointment.
I doubt nor, Sir, your contemplations have
inspired some ideas. congenial to the above, on a
recent eventâthe failure of our application to
Congress. For iho* it hat been insinuated that
it is (joflible Jome perjons may have been a&natcd
by improper motives on the occasionâyet I can
bear witnrfs to the honor, confijlcncy and public
spirit of Mr. | B â nofinifter mo
tive! have influenced your exertion. You, Sir,
early engaged in the service of your country from
patriotic principles, and pcrfevered without the
JmalltJt deviation Irom ihcjfrift line of duty to
the end of-the contest. Some have aflerted that
you began the bufyiefs of speculation while in
the armyâthat you descended to every artifice
to poffrfs your felt of the claims of the soldiersâ
but others prettnd to think this cannot be trueâ
for they fay it is well known, that at the close of
the war, you were not possessed of property fuf
ficient to countenance such a suggestionâbesides,
it is said by some who know you well, that tho*
you werecurfed with the itch of speculation, yet
poffefling too much of a projecting spirit, like
those ol other eminent personages, your schemes
and fpeculaiions have terminated in difappoint
inriu, loss and poverty.
I cannot help, Sir, cxpreffing my sympathy
with youoo the unfortunate issue of some of your
truly benevolent and virtuouscnterprizes of <> more
recent date. Inflamed by the fire of philan
thropy, you took your late tour to the foutheni
states, to kindle a flame in the bosom of
some persons there. With what plealure did
all your fellow laborers behold your name a-
the southern gazettes. It is to be la
mented that your fuccels was so partial in this
business ; and that you entirely Jailed, for want of
the Rhtnd in your land war rant and cer
tificate speculation. You had no cash, anil
alas, they would not trust you. We have to la
ment, my dear fellow laborer, that all our trou
ble and expence in piocuring the Ion? lift of
names from the public offices of those we in
tended to cheat, were thrown away. Here let
me caution you to be on your guard against
wolves in flieep-fk'ns. But, dear, Sir, the best
intentions are often fruftTated. I (hall never fdhr
get the unmerited abuse you received in New-
York on a certain occasion, when the Poftrnafter
was so uncomplaifant as to prevent you from'-;
prescribing rules in his offiee. Your object was
doubtless laudable; but he could not fee thro*
the justice of fending your letters at half price.
There are many other matters and things on
which I could condole with youâbut the time
fails me at presentâand you have in our old
friend and counsellor, the author of 44 the poor
soldiers* plea," so f\mpathizing, kind and generous
an aUy % that I need not enlarge at this time. I
fhali conclude therefore at present with proposing
that you fhculd go on with the good work ;
should you succeed, our fortunes are madeâwe
know w'ho will be entitled to the benefit of de
preciation, from North-Carolina toNew-Hamp
fhire.
You know there are the letters of a certain
head of a department, which you have said are
in your pofTeflionâthefc you rnujl bring for
ward, or I a flu re you, there is danger of your
being obliged to acknowledge that you are a
liar; and it would be a horrid thing for you
ytwftlf to pub!ipi such a faÂ£L
There is one thing more, my dear james, 1 and
I have done-r-a jnoft formidable majority in the.
governrpent is agafnft usâand, I believe, among
the people. You have abused individualsâmen
whom oeither you nor I were ever acquainted
with, and never will be ; but take care, my dear
fellowâdo not damn the whole majority of
Congress as a set of scoundrels, left your tongue
should become too long for your mouth,
Your's, in much amity,

For the GAZETTE oj the UNITED STATES.
THE army memorial lays stress on their
being paid certificates worth 3/. in the
pound, instead of 2of. in money. It is neces
sary to be correal in our ideas of this opera
tion. The army had an unliquidated demand.
It was liquidated, and the final settlements
ifiued in consequence. It would be absurd
to imagine that the unliquidated demand re
mained in force as well as the new certificate
given in lieu of it; for in that cafe the Uni
ted States will be charged twice for the fame
debt. Common sense and common pra&ice
teach every person that the new certificate
created a new demand, instead of the old Â«ne;~
as a bond puts an end to a running account.â
In this sense, and-in this sense only, the certi
ficate operated as payment. But it carried
the evidence of their whole demand at 20f.
in the pound in specie. The army memo
rialists seem to have erected averyfolid work
on a fictitious bafts- Had the old demand of
the army been liquidated and fettled by the
delivery of counterfeit certificates, the old
debt would have remained in force, becaule
the new demand could not have any force at
all. Every man who has served on a jury or
even seen a court of juftiee, will perceive
that the do&rine of the certificates being
worth and discharging only 3J. instead of 20/,
is wholly unfounded ; whatever their market
value might be, they certainly carried on the
faee the evidence of the whole fnm of 2of.
the certificates being made transferable was
no accommodation to the publicâas it is
plain whoever might keep them, the public
would be charged to pay the full amount.â
They were made transferable it is said on
the request of the armyâwhether this be
true or falfe is not very material; for it is
inconceivable that the final rettferhentslhonld
carry to every poffefTor a right to 2of. against
the public, and yet (hould discharge the public
of only 3/ of the debt due the officers. In
stead therefore of faying that the certificates
were given the officers in payment, which is
not true, we fliould fay, they were given on a
final settlement of their claims, and were
(not the payment, but) the evidence of their
whole demand. The question of their me
rits, their fufferings and lofTes, is not intended
to be included in these remarksâwhich are
made to shew that the principle on which
they reft their claims, as of right, is unsound.

ExtraS oj a letter from a gentleman at Clifton, near
Arijiol, (EnglandJ to his jriend in Baltimore,
dated Oftoter to, 1792.
" With refpeift to politics, the Englilh
newspapers will (hew you to what outrageous
lengths the Jacobins and Republicans of
France have carried on matters. We are in
daily expectation of hearing of their having
facrificed the poor King and Queen. âThe
Auftrians and Prussians seem to have been
grossly niifled by the Emigrants, in represent
ing a larger body of malcontents in the king
dom of France, than there appears to be.
They advanced rapidly under the idea of sup
port, tut finding the body of the people against
them, they have retreated, and, I suppose, it
will end in the rascals' establishing their own
wild incoherent system of government. If
they would only content themselves with
bringing on their own deftruftion, no person
would care whether they had any government
or not, or be interested in it; but when they
threaten every country in Europe with fend
ing emilTaries abroad, to poison the minds of
the common people, to subvert every thing
that is decent and refpeftable in each coun
try, it then becomes a matter of moment to
each to endeavor to counteract their schemes. ,
At prcjent, I am very sure, the good sense of I
the great body of the people in this country 1 /,
is against any such innovation ; and, I be-j
lieve, Mr. Thomas Paine, at length, begins
to think so. He embarked at Dover for France
' the other day, amidjl the hijfcstrd execrations oj the
populaceâ¢"
It is without doubt one of the greatest of
fences that can be committed, in the view of
certain charaflers, so much as to doubt the
goodness of those motives, which lead modern
reformers to beat down every barrier between
that virtue on which republics can alone ex
ist, and that Infidelity which recognizes no
thing as a crime that may conduce to facili
tating the ambitious views of its disciples.

A writer in a lateLar.don paper, [peak
ing of La Fayktte
TF France ever inhaled the fa
i cred august spirit of Liberty,
if she has {hewn to the world mag
nanimous proofs of it, it is to La
Fayette that she is in a great mea
sure indebted for this. It was from
him that France firft knew that a
worthy citizen and soldier were no
incompatible terms; that all men
are by nature free and equal, as to
their rights. He would havetaught
them, that a conftiuition formed by
the uuanimous fufFrage of Free-
Men, ought to be refpetfted and
obeyed. Prevented in his career of
glory by the arts of infiduous and
abandoned factions, he yet merits
the eulogy of every good man,
whose hearts must be touched at the
ignoble deftinj which now awaits
Win.
" I will not enquire whether the
Combined Armies had a right,when
he quitted his country, to treat him
as a prisoner at warâperhaps they
had; but surely the fate of that
General nnift be Angularly hard,
who, if before incapable of return
ing to his native country, is now,'
by the lare decree ag3in(t all jEmi
grants, to be considered as of no
Nation. He is then to undergo,
unless timely relieved, perpetual
imprisonment. There is no one
(whatever may be their inclinati
ons) 111 Fiance who can liberate
him. To whom, then, can the pro
vince of ranlbtning an Hero who
has contributed to the deftruclion
of defpotirm in France, devolve ?
It is reserved for the Englishâto
that manly and generous nation,
who has lately evinced by its con
duct that it is unswayed and unbi
ased by narrow views ; that it for
gets enmities ; that has illnftrated
most strikingly to this and every
succeeding age, that Ihe regards no
longer the confined docftrines which
till of late ifolared her frojn Euro
peans ; that all mankind in distress
are her brethren : â Perfetfi these
laudable efforts of benevolence and
philanthropyâRelease La Fayette
from his manacles.âAmerica is too
far diftanc to engage herfelf in Eu
ropean broils; and from joo only
be has any hopes. Hasten (hen ye;
generous Britons! to his fuccoor K
and immortalize your names."
