I ''HE early, decided, and peifevering patriot,

Safety as tlie public, deserves every diiHnclion

Such services, and fiich principles, have placed
you, Sir, in the feat of government, with
out helitation or diflent: and New-Jersey nolon-
S er f ee l s the wound which fhc has received by
the death of a Livingston, when a Paterson
supplies his place.
The inhabitants of Trenton, and the vicinity,
equally sensible of your merits, and equally grate
ful for your past services, with the relt of :heir
fellow-citizens, would do injustice to their own
feelings, were they to suppress the fatisfadtion
and approbation they feel upon so happy and
unanimous a choice of a Chief Magistrate.

With well-founded aflurance that your future

In behalf of the Inhabit ants,

Trenton, Nov. 24, 1 790.
Gentlemen,
I SCARCELY know in what manner to make my
far your polite and affec
tionate address. Language fails ire 1 cannot
defcribethe emotions of gratitude and refpedt,
which rife in niy bread but believe me, gen
tlemen, I feel my heart lenfibly feels upon
the occasion.
The attention and hospitality, which, as a pri
vate individual, I have experienced from the in
habitants of Trenton, and its vicinity, I shall ever
retain in grateful memory ; and I have no doubt
that whenever inclination may lead, or the du
ties ofoffice may call thereâor whether my ftav
be as a relident, or as a guest, I shall meet whii
a cordial reception, and be treated with every
mark of civility and politeness.
That my conduct in thedifferent offices, which
I have had the honor to fill, has met with the ap
probation of a free and enlightened people, gives
ine unfeigned pleasure ; andit is my fervent with,
that I may in future demean myfelf in fucli a
manner as to cherish and increase this favorable
opinion. My interest as a citizen conspires with
my duty as a ruler to advance the growth and
prosperity of this State, and to promote the wel
fare and glory of the Union at large. In this
sentiment I am sure of meeting with your hearty
concurrence, and that of every good and wife
man in the State, As Freemen, we have but
one common object ; as Citizens of the United
States, our interests and our rights are now the
fame. That narrow fyflem of local politics,
which, for a time, diftradled our counsels, distur
bed our repose, and tarnished our glory, is <rra
.dually disappearing, under the benign influc'nce
and diifufive operation of the new :
Our political horizon extends and brightens
As a people we are united and happy at-home
and as a nation refpe<fied abroad.ââMav New-
Jersey sustain her rank in the political scale of
the Union!âTo realize this wish. ought to be our
aimâour studyâand pur pride. May the ar
dour of patriotism be kindled into an active and
noble emulationâand may we, in our refpeiftive I
flat ionsâand within the fpheie of ourinfluence
vie with each other, who shall contribute most to
the welfare and aggrandizement of our common
country ! In this generous contention, all the fo
etal virtues will be called into exerciseâall the
bigq-toned passions will be enlisted on the fide of
duty, and whatever is amiable in character, or
sublime in acftion, will rife to view, and warm
and animate the portrait of an American citizen.
Tiius may we a<ft and after a life, full of be
neficence and years, may yon be translated to that
happy world, where the patriot, and friend of
Mankind, will receive a sure and InfHng reward.

ti i" t i l^ m to e afi Â»medbjrthe UnitedStatei
he law of Congress for aifuming theltate debts
acfant view, renders any such resolve a nullitv'
It cannot be thrown into any shape, in which k
will not contradict and destroy itfelf. Let me
alk what Congress have undertaken to do ? The
answer is ; they have undertaken to nfl'ume the
ltate debts. But when a ltate has paid any cerii
ficatesand got them into the Treasury, there no
longer exists a debt relative to such redeemed
certificates. A debt cannot cxift without two par
ties ; a debtor and creditor. When a debt is once
paid, both those relations are deftroved and the
debt is ot course annihilated. The alTumption.
law, m such cafe, has nothing to operate upon ;
because, the fubjet r t of that law, is debts ; andthe
agents who are to reeeive the payment, are cre
ditors. Now when the debt has once been dis
charged, there is 110 longer a debtor, and con -
fequently there can be no creditor, since one
cannot exifl: without the other. Adebt is a thin"-
which does not admit of a refurreiftion. Its pay
ment, by the person who owed it, is its final de
'trucftioii. I will put a cafe.
A ifHies anumber of notes payable to difFerent
persons ; and before he has discharged them all.
B undertakes the payment of such demands as
may lie against A.âlt is obvious, without any
arguments, that the engagement is not meant to
extend to those notes which A had himfelf dis
charged and taken up. This plain reason may
be aiiigned for it, that when the note reverts in
to the hands of the giver, the demand vanilhes,
andean never afi'ume a new existence. I once
more repeat, that it is a contradiction in terms,
to fay that an afl'umption of debts can be applied
where there is 110 debt.
In what character will a state come forward
witli its own notes Ifit comes forward as a.dtit
er. the ademption law can take cognizance of
creditors only. If on the other hand, the tfate
calls itfelf a creditor, it is cad out from the bene
fit of che affiimption, because the state in beino
a creditor ceases to be a debtor, and therefore
there can be 110 debt for the afl'umption to take
hold of. But it will be said, the ltate may ap
pear in the capacity both of creditor and debtor.
This is impoilible in the nature of things. Be
cause, debtor and creditor are counterparts of
such a kind, that when they meet in the fame
person, they destroy each other and ftarjdfor no
thing- CONSISTENCY.

A jufter being, or a nobler mind .
For honor and for probity renown'd,
In thee the Patriot and the Sage were found.
By moderation tempering rigid law,
Thou knewM poor to cheer, the rich to awe.
New-York beheld thy steady, gen'rous phn,
And all the world (hould blefsthe friend of ima.
Patron of commerce from thy youthful years,
No Tradesman left thy doors diffolv'd in tears.
Favour from thee th' industrious poor teceiv'd,
Their wants, when known, were generously reliev'd.
Religion reign'd in thy capacious heart,
And heavenly charity perform'd her part.
In private life each duty well difcharg'd ;
Strcngthen'd thy efforts, and thy foul enlarg'd ;
The parent's, hutband's worth, by thee difplay'd,
A bright example to the world convey'd.
To thee, since talents, piety, were given,
Earth's ornament may hope reward from Heav'n.

ANECDOTES
A COXCOMB asked a fluttering barber's
boy, in New-Havenâdid you ever /have a mon
key ? No Sir, said he, but if you will set down
I will t-t-try.
â A FLOURISHING Coxcomb the other day
came into a Soemaker's ftiop to try on a pair of
boots. " These are too fliort for the Ton" said
he, "tlieyfhould be long enough to cover up
the Calf compleatly." " Then" said the flioe
xnaker " They mud be abont five feet ten inehts."MR. FENNO,
THE Secretary of State, in his Repoit on the fubjefl of eftablifh
incj a uniformity in the weight-., measures and coins of the
United Srates, has given us an ample testimony of his fcicntific abi
lities, and from a scries of public condutt, a proof, that refined
fcienee, and republican virtue, arc not incompatible.
The idea of using the Pendulum as a univcrfal standard for mca
lure, is not new ; but the public is principally indebted to the Se
cretary for the general application of it, and making it likewise
the basis of both weights, and cubical, or solid mensuration.
In order to make a universal standard for any purpose, it will
be found neceflary to have recourse to fomc unalterable principle
lor that purpose. The Secretary has chosen Gravity, which pro
duces nearly the fame efleÂ£ts, over every part of our globe : From
â which circumftancethis importantconclufion refults,v!z. that two*
persons, in different parts of the world, will each, by the applica
tion of pendulous bars to their clocks, or regulators, of such a
length as to produce seconds, constitute the ftarxlard Yard of the
Secretary ; and so nearly of a length, that they may be indiicrim
inately used for all common purposes; but where great exaÂ£fcnefs
is neceflary, it will be requisite to reduce the Pendulum to the
ftandaid of fomc particular latitude. This Rod, or Pendulum, the
Secietary divides into five equal parts, called feet, these feet into
ten equal parts, called inches, these inches into ten equal parts,
called lines, and lastly, these lines into ten equal parts, called
points. The Standard when thus graduated is compleat. The
foot, or one fifth part of this rod, gives the cubical dimcafions of
the capacity of the Buftiel, which becomes the Standard, or Radix,
out of which all the other cubical measures of capacity take their
rife. The inch of this rod, gives the cubical dimensions of the
capacity of a vefiel, the weight of which capacity, or cubic inch
of rain-water, constitutes the ounce ; which becomes the standard
of Weights. The money-unit, or dollar, with the alloy alieady
eftablifhcd by the United States, will be equal to the weight of
the ounce, or cubic inch -of rain-water.
Hence trom this universal standard, (which is nearly as fixed as
Gravity,) all kinds of Measures, Weights and Coins, may be re
gulated in the most harmonious manner. In forming the stand
ard for this plan, there is nothing left to caprice and whim, which
circumstance alone must banish discordance, and entitle it to a
ilc-cided preference over all the vaiious regulations now in nfe.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT is a republican principle that, the majority
shall Govern : In all communities this majority
is composed of the middling and poorei clafi'es
of the people; these clafles, united, arefuperior
to all opposition ; and whenever they are set in
motion, to pursue an objed: on just principles,
the general good is invariably promoted their
prosperity always includes that of the other class,
the rich and independent. I presume it will be
granted, that the education of the children of
every rank in society, is a consideration of the
firft importance, and ought to be an objeA of at- |
tention to every man whose bosom glows with a
spark of philanthropy, or good citizenlhip. The
affluent are so sensible of the advantages of learn-
that they never neglect a suitable proviiion
for their own offspring ; but this chaiity, which
beoiiii at home, is never extended but in a paitial
manner. I believe it will be found that no com
petent proviiion for an utiiverfal diffufion of the
means of education ever was or can be made, but
at the instance of those who constitute what is
denominated the niafs of the people. Oit the
middling and lower clailes then this business de
volves, and they are fully competent to the un
dertaking. Uniting their strength, and exert
-sn<r their force, they may accomplifli the desira
ble object. If the peotle fay that a law shall
be made obliging every town, consisting of a
(riven number of inhabitants, to support afchool
or schools, in which the children of every house
holder shall have a right to be inftrutfted, it shall
be done.âOr if the citizens of any corporation
unite in so laudable a design as to provide for
the establishment of public i'chools at the expence
of the whole community, every individual of which
to be benefited by the institution, if they chufe,
what is there to hinder the plan from being car
ried into execution ? As I laid before, this rnuft
be done by the middling class of peopleâin the
country, by the yeomanry, the labourers and far
mersâin the fta-poris, by the mechanics, the ar
tifls and inferior traders: These are immediately
interfiled the rich more remotely, tho efl'enti
ally j -but the affluent having it in their power to
provide for their tun, it is only from tisesfity,and
by beinÂ°- out-vuiid\>y the majority that they will
ever be brought to contribute to the support of
such competent institutions, which they can do
without. We hear much about Charity-Schoolsâ-
they are mere illujions by which the poor are di
verted from a proper attention to their interett;
thpy never were competent to the exigencies of
the poor in any country. If by united exertions
the free citizens of this country can provide tor
themselves, I hope they will never depend on
charity. ' , ,
I conclude the present remarks by a quotation
from an ingenious and animated address to the
citizens of" Delaware, which appeared in the
Delaware Gazette .of Bth inft.
" It is too notorious to need formal proot,that
" in those parts of our own and other countries,
*' where public schools, and places of liberal
<< education, are numerous, encouraged, and
Â« amply fupportecf, there without many excepti
-4S ons, flourifh improvements in society, and the
arts of life, and every thing contributing to
" national happiness and prosperity ; there go
Â« \erniuent is Ipirited and energeuck ; there
Â« wealth and eminence rife with equal and ra
pid strides ; there is molt permanency and
" tranquility. The l'eafon is plainâEvery rank
" and order of citizens, in the mechanical as well
" as the liberal profefiions, are men ot inforniati
" on.difcernmentand reflection ; capable not only
" of managing their business in such a mariner as
" to procure themselves affluence and eafÂ«,butof
" making and communicating such interelling

" his mite, with as much fncccfs as the more

Extratt of a letter from lieut. Ebcnezer Frotbingham,

" I had determined to write to you very par
ticularly from this place, but you will excufeme
when you know the grief and pain oi lieui t 1
now feel. I arrived the day before yesterday ;
Mr. Ernest informed me that he had the evening
before received a packet of letters for me from
home ; my heart gladdened in expectation of hear
ing from my wile and friends ; but O ! the afto
niliiment of my foul, when on opening my let
ters I found my clear wife was no more : My
faireft, my brightest profpeifls oil this fide eter
nity are blasted in the very bud ; flie died sud
denly, only five days illness. ; went off in a faint
ing fit without a groan. The molt comfortable
afi'urance {he palled to her Saviour's arms,,is my
only consolation in this my hour of grief and
woe : why was (he removed so soon, even whilil
my fond heart was anticipating the help and ad

The arrival of Mr. Robias at this place from
Sandm'ky, and the accounts brought by him of
the difpoiition of the Indians, is rather unfavora
ble. It appears that they are early
in the spring to turn out for war, and commit
depredations on the frontiers ; that they are
greatly elevated with the ill'ue of the late cam
paign, and (when speaking of it) fay they are
more than men. It may be neceilary forthc in
habitants 011 the frontiers tolceep a watchful eye,
although there may be no great danger', as a re
port of this kind never loses by frequent re
peating ; and we flatter ourselves their attenti
on will be called toa more diitant quarter, 1 in or

HARTFORD, Jan. 10.
Some of the public creditors in Pennsylvania, have presented
COngrcfs with a petition, the stile of which, in imitation of Gib
bon, is most sublimely and elegantly obfeure, but the design of which
is to induce Cougrcfs to the funding fyftein and give iix per
cent, interest on the whole public deot at once. They call them
(elves the patriotic viclimt of the war; when in truth three fourths of
them are [peculators, who have purchased most of the public paper
for less than half its value.
They begin their tedious address with charging the Secretary of
the Treasury with in recognizing the justice of their
claims m the utmost latitude, in the beginning of- his report, and
then recommending a plan of funding the debtat less thanjwas ori
ginally promised. They proceed to charge Congress with having
lojl the disposition to do jujlice, altho they had acquired the power.
After fouie common place remarks on the moral and political obli*-
gation of contratts and the importance of public credit, they enumerate
the many promiies made to the creditors by Congrcfs under the
confederation, and then charge the present lcgiflature of the Uni
on, with having clandeflinely obtained an unreasonable concejfion from
the creditoes, and with having infringed the original contract ur.d de
flroyedits principles. They charge the indire&ly with be
ing callous to their merits and fujferings, and tarnishing the glories of
America with broken contrails and violated faith. i hey declare the
old Congrels to have been a wife and virtuous body, v/bopratlfzd
right, as far as they were able ; but the present ast for
vilion for the public debt, thi-v fay. is nv
thepnbHcfaith, a flriking controfl to the il'ujlrious example of the
Cengref, and a dangerous infraction of the- fundamental laws 4fjujiict.
In short, the whole petition is bui a round about way ot leiling,

Thurfdav laftarrived at Greenock., the Peggy, Captain Mar

Colville, a native of Arbroath, from Algiers, from whom we
have received the following information:âln July,
Ihip Dolphin, O'Bryen, matter, belonging to Philadelphia, was
captured by ail Algerine xebec, and the crew, consisting of .15
men, carried into slavery, four of whom belong to Scotland,

Paterfon of Aberdeen. The three lad still remain in slavery, and
fix of the reil were cut off by the plague about two years ago, at
which timeabove 800 christian slaves fliared the fame fate. Col
ville obtained his liberty, upon his friends paying 3501. as 2ran

by that ornament of mankind, George Dempfter,'Efq. of Duni

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
TUESDAY, Jan. 11.
In committee of the whole, on the bill repealing after
the last day of next the att laying duties oil
difiitkdfpirits, ire. and impofitig others sa tbzrf
flead_.
r pHÂ£ 1 Jth fetftion was read, which refpetfts the
Jl duty on spirits distilled from materials the
growth or produce of the country.
Mr. Jackson moved that this fectioil {liould be
(truck out. He observed that this he conceived
to be the (tage of tlve bill in which aftand ought
to be made by its oppofers ; this clause respeCts
the produce of the country âand here the friends
| of American manufactures and produce ought o
make their exertions to defeat the bill. Het
read a particular estimate, by which he falu
appears that the proposed provision was emi
ufineceffary. He then, offered some general
fervations 011 the bill: Direct taxation, faia 1-Â»
has been objetfted to âthis power is as fuJJy "
cognized in the conditution as the right of .â 
ing excisesâthose therefore who are oppof Â«<
the latter, have as good a right to offer the'
jecftions as those opposed to the former.
Secretary fays we ought to leave direift taxi
a rcfource for a future emergency ; but is it 1
better to have tiro resources than one.? Thepost duties must increase, and a fuffieient revenue
for every, purpose from that source, is to be ex
pected. Why then should we lay this odious tax r
He concluded by faying he fliould lay his elti
inate before the house.
Mr. W adfvvorth fa id he had also made some
calculations which he fliould iubmit to the house :
In these he had taken pains to be as accurate as
pofiible. He then read his cftimate, by which
it appeared that the probable amount of the im
poli would be dimii.ifned even below the iuin
stated by the Secretary of the Trealury. ihe
tonnage he said would be diminished, owing to
the change in the present situation of Europe,
and the cefl'ation of the demand tor grain.
The importation of molafles and sugar mull be
ledened as the articles are not to be had. Great
' part of the European importations for the palt
year have been made on (peculation, and are not
to be again expectedâand there will be, said he,
a very great decrease in the amount of the le-
Jienue 011 wines.
He adverted to the vVeftern Expedition, and
observed, a greater lutn than what has been men
tioned will be wanted on that account âand the
pension lift, he feared, would be encreaf'ed, ra
ther rhan diminiflied : On the whole he thought
there was no danger of a great excess in the re
venue. The duty on domestic spirits he consi
dered as properâit is.a duty that will be sub
mitted to by the even a direct tax
would be paid without murmuring, if the necef-
fity was made apparenr.
Mr. Jackson replied to Mr. Wadfworthâlie
controverted the eltimate offered by that gentle
man and then entered into a recapitulation of
his arguments against the bill, and urged the
postponement of it to the next feflion.
Mr. Stone observed that the house had at last
got into a mode of considering the fubjett, which
ouglit to have been attended to at firit.
He adverted to the drawback Hated by the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania ; but he desired to
know why this fÂ«m, which amounts to upwarrds
of 10,000 dollars, is not mentioned by the Se
cretary of the Treasury : He considered the slim
Hated by the Secretary for the year '89, as the
neat produce of the revenueâand he believed,
that would be found to be the Sum. With relpect
to the decrease in the importations, this had been
the cry for seven years back : He believed this
â would continue to be the cafe, tho the importa
tions, he was well fatisfied, would continue to
cncreafeâand this would be owing to our en
creafing population.
I he gentleman frora -Pcnnfylvajnia has noticed
â¢ the probable oecreale in the importation of teas,
wines, &c. but takes no notice of the inereafe in
the importation of other articles. He said gen
tlemen had called our attention to the Mediter
ranean and Indian Expeditions ; but neither of
these fubjedls are now before the committee. If
these fubjedts are to be considered, let us go into
a committee 011 them, and fee what is neceflary
to be done. At present we are deviling ways and
means to pay the interest of the State debtsâand
with refpecft to this object, he conceived the re
venue to be derived from the present eftablilh
inents, will be Aifficient for that and all the other
exigencies of government, till the year 1793. â
It is now said, that the Exclfe will be fufKcient
for all the demands of government ; but he fuf
pedted, that he iliould hear something 011 the
l'ubjedt of Tonnage before the end of the feliion.

It is expe&ed that the attempt to debar the flower of our coun

themselves in that most noble acquifuion, the science of military

Extratt of a letter from Peter/burg, to the Editor, dated Jan. 7.
" As Congress have had it in contemplation to lay a imallpoft
age on newspapers, I have thought it necessary to acquaint you f
that if this ihould take place, that your fuhicribers here will pro
bably withdraw their subscriptions ; not from any wish of injur
ing you, or your paper, because they seem to give it a preference ;
but the idea of a postage on newspapers, however trifling, seems
to alarm them.
" For my part, I do not pretend to much knowledge in poli
tics, or in the policy of this measure ; but it appears to me very ex
traordinary, thatour political rulersfliould,To early, attempt to draw
a revenue from a source, that they ought, in my humble opinion,
to contribute to the support ofâor at leafl to promote ibe circula
tion of newspapers with as much facilityas poflible.
" Peiiodical publications in this country (indeed in every
country) have heretofore been found extremely beneficialâand
are more particularly so at this period, when every one is anxious
to be "informed of the proceedings of Congress ; and should any
measures be adopted to deprive the people of that information, there
is no knowing what might be the confequenceâfor when the people
are in the dark as to what is going forward at the head of affairs,
they are apt to make enquiries, begin to grow fufÂ£icious< âand
designing men might take advantage of their ignorance, and lead
them to believe what might prove dangerous to the peacc of so
ciety.
" But I need not dwell on this fubjeft, because these are circum
stances that mud be apparent to every one. All I can fay is, that
so long as the people are well informed of the measures of Con
gress, they will remain perfe&ly fatisfied, as they will then judge
for themselves, from facts, and not be abused .by misrepresenta
tions ; but lhould any measures be entered into to check the cir
culation of newspapers, the only fonrce thro' which they can be
informed, I will venture to fay their measures will be rendered
very unpopular.
" I feel myfelf interested in the free circulation of well-con
ducted pei iodieal publications, because I am so sensible of the
great benefit our country derives from themâand I hope nothing
will ever be adopted to debar the people of this great source of
political information."

December 15, I
In obedience to the order of the House or Re
presentatives of the 9th Day of August last,
requiring the Secretary of the Trmsury
to prepare and report, on this Day, such fur
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, lie ne
ceflary for establishing the.PUBLIC CREDIT
âthe said Secretary further
Respectfully reports,
(continued from our last.)
BANKS arc among the bed expedients for lowering the rate of
interest in a country ; but to have this effect, their capitals
must be completely equal to all the demands of business, and such
as will tend to remove the idea, that the accommodations they af
ford, are in any degree favors ; an idea very apt to accompany
the parsimonious dispensations of contra&ed funds. I* this, as in
every other cafe, the plenty of the commodity ougV.t to beget a
moderation of the price.
7 he want of a principle of rotation, in the constitution of the
bank, of North-America, is another argument for a variation of
the eftabliHiment. Scarcely one of the reasons which militate
agamfl this principle in the conflitution of a country, is applica
ble to that of a bank ; while there are strong reasons in favor of
it, in relation to the one, which no doubt apply to the other.
The knowledge to be derived from experience is the only circum
flance common to both, which pleads against rotation in the di
re&ing officers ot a bank.
But the obje&s of the government of a nation, and those of the
government of a bank, arc so widely different, as greatly to weak
en the force of that confider3tion, iu reference to the latter. Al
most every important caf; of legislation requires, towards a right
decision, a general and accurate acquaintance with the affairs of
the State; and habits of thinking seldom acquired, but from a
familiarity of public concerns. The adminiilration of a bank, on
the contrary, is regulated bv a few simple fixed maxims, the ap
plication of which is not difficult to any man of judgment, efpe
eially if inflru&ed in the principles of trade. It is in general a
constant fucceflion of the fame details.
But though this be the cafe, the idea of the advantages of ex
perience is not to be flighted. Room ought to be left for the re
gular tianfmiffion of official information. And for this purpose,
the head of the direction ought to be excepted from the principle
of rotation. With this exception, and with the aid of the in
formation of the subordinate officers, there can be no danger of
any ill effeÂ£ls from want of experience, or knowledge ; especially
Â«ts the periodical exclusion ought not to reach the whole of the di
reÂ£lors at one time.
The argument in favor of the principle of rotation is this, that
by leflening the danger of combinations among the dirc6lors, to
make the inflitution subservient to party views,or to the accommo
dation, preferably, of any particular set of men, it will render
the public confidence more firm, stable and unqualified.
When it is considered, that the diieÂ£lors of a bank are not eie&-
cd by the great body of the community, in which a diversity of
views will naturally prevail, at different conjunÂ£tures, but by a
small and fele6l class of "men, among whom it is far more easy to
cultivate a steady adherence to the fame peifons and objeÂ£is ; and
that those dire&ors have it in their power so immediately to con
ciliate, by obliging the most influential of this class, it is easy to
perceive, that without the principle of rotation, changes in that
body can rarely happen, but as a concession which they may them
fclves think it expedient to make to public opinion.
The continual adminiilration of an institution of this kind, by
the fame persons, will never fail, with or without cause, from
their conduct, to excite diflruft and discontent. The necefTarv
secrecy of their tranfaÂ£lions, gives unlimited scope to imagination
to infer that fomcthmg is, <;r may be wrong. And this inevitable
mystery is a lolid rcafon for inserting in the conflitution of a bank
the nr ceffity of a change of men. As neither the mass of the pai
ties intercfted, nor the public in general, can be permitted to be
â witnefits of the interior management of the,directors, it is rea
sonable that both should have that check upon their conduÂ£l, and
that security against the prevalency of a partial or pernicious sys
tem, which will beproduced by the ccrtainty of periodical changes.
Such too is the delicacy of the credit of a bank, that every thing
â which can fortify confidence and repel suspicion, without injuring
its operations, ought carefully to be fought after in its formation.
A further confederation in favour of a change, is the improper
rule, by which the right of voting for dire&ors is regulated in the
plan, upon which the bank of North-America was originally
eonftituted, namely, a vote for each ftiare, and the want of a rule
in the last charter; unless the silence of it, on that pointy may fig
fiify that every stockholder is to have an equal and fir.glc vote,
-which would be a rule in a different extreme, not less erroneous.
It is of importance that a rule should be cftablifhed on this head,
as it is one of those things which ought not to be left to discre
tion; and it is consequently of equal importance, that the rule
should be a proper one.
A vote for each share, renders a combination between a few
principal stockholders, to monopolize the power and benefits of
the bank, too easy. An equal vote to each stockholder, however
â¦rreat or small his interest in the institution, allows not that degree
cf weight to large stockholders, which it is reasonable they Ihould
liave, and vvhich perhaps their security and that of the bank re
quire. A prudent mean is to be preferred. A convitlion of this
has produced a bye-law of the corporation of the bank of North-
America, which evidently aims at such a mean. But ar< flection
arises here, that a like majority with that which cnatted this law,
may at any moment repeal it,
The last inducement which shall be mentioned, is the want of
>recautions to guard against a foreign influence infinuatiug itfelf
nto the dire&ion of the bank. It fecms fcarccly reconcileable
vith a due caution, to permit that any but citizens should be eli
;ible, as di'e&ors of a national bank, or that non-resident foreign
:rs should be able to influence the appointment of dire&ors, by
he votestheir proxies. In the event, however, of an incorpo
ration of the bank of North-America, in the plan, it mav be ne
ceflary to qualify this principle, so as to leave the right of f rsign
ers, who now hold (hares of its stock, unimpaired ; but without
the power of transmitting the privilege in question, v .o foreign
alienees.
It is to be considered, that such a bank is not a mere matter of
private property, but a political machine of the greatest. import
ance to the state.
There are other variations from the conftitutiori of the bank of
North-America, not of inconsiderable moment, which appear de
arable, but which are not of magnitude enough to claim a preli
minary difcuflion. These will be seen in the plan which will be
submitted in the sequel.
If the obje&ions which have been stated, to the conflitution ot
the bank of Worth-America, are admitted to be well founded, they
-will nevertheless not derogate fiom the merit of the main design,
or of the services which that bank has rendered, or of the benefits
â which it has produced. The creation of such an inftirution, at the
time it took place, was a mcafure d'ftated by wisdom. Its utility
has been amply cvinced by its fruitsâAmerican independence
owes much to itâand it is very conceivable, that reasons of the
moment mav have rendered those features in it inexpedient, which
a revision, with a permanent view, suggests as desirable.
The order of the fubjett leads next to an inquiry into the prin
ciples upon which a national bank ought to be organized.
"f Jic fituarioni of the United States naturally infpircs a wifli, that
the form of the institution could admit of a plurality of branches.
But various confederations discourage from pursuing this idea. The
complexity of such a plan would be apt to inspire doubts, which
might deter from adventuring in it. And the praÂ£licabilit)*of a
fafc and ordtrly adminiflration, though not to be abandoned as
desperate, cannot be made so manifeft in ncrfpeÂ£tive, ai'to pro
mile the removal of those doubts, or to juflify the government in
adopting the idea as an original experiment. The most that would
feein advifeable, on this point, is to insert a provision, which may
lead f.o it hereafter ; if experience fhali more clearly demonstrate
i's utility, and fatisfy those who may have the direÂ£lion,that it may
be adopted with fafety. It is certain, that it would have fomc
.advantages, both peculiar and important, fides more general
accommodation, it would lessen the danger of a run upon the
bank.
The argument against it is, that each branch must be under a
fiiftinft, though subordinate direttion, to which a considerable la
titude of discretion mult of necefluy be entrnfted. And as th<_
property of the whole inflitupion would be liable for the engage-
ot each part, that and its cr dit would be at flake, upon the
prudence of the dire&ors of every'part. The mismanagement oJ
either branch might hazard serious dilorder in the whole.
Another wish, di&ated by t)ie particular fnuation of the coun
try, is, that the bank could be so conftitutcd as to be made an im
mediate inilrument of loans to the proprietors of land ; but this
wish alio yields to the difficulty of accomplishing it. Land is
alone an unfit fund for a bank circulation. If the notes iflued
upon it were not to be payable in coin, on demand, or at a short
date, this would amount to nothing more than a repetition of the
paper emiflions, which are now exploded by the general voice.
If the notes are to be payable in coin, the.land must firft be con
verted into it by sale, or mortgage. The difficulty of effecting the
latter, is the very th'ng which begets the desire of finding another
resource, and the former would not be practicable on a sudden
emergency, but with facrifices which would make the cure worse
than the difcafe. Neither is the idea of constituting the fund part
ly of coin and partly of land, free from impediments. Thefetwo
species of property do not, for the most part, unite in the fame
hands. Will the monied man confeat to enter into a partnership
with the landholder, by which the latter wi.l lhare in the profits
which zvill be madefy the money of the former ? The money, it is
evident, will be the agent or efficient cause of the profitsâthe land
can only be regarded as an additional security. It is not difficult
to forefee, that an union, on iuch terms, will not readily be form
ed. If the landholders are to procure the money by the sale or
mortgage of a part of their lands, this they can as well do, when
the itock confilts wholly oi money, as if it were Lo be compound
ed of money and land. â¢

CONDITIONS OF SUBSCRIPTION.

scribers, Three-Guineas for cacn print; one half to be paid at the
time of fubicribing, the remainder on the delivery of the prints,

Subscriptions are received in this city by Joseph Anthony,
jun. Goldsmith and Jeweller, No. 76, Ma ket-ftrcet.
Thef prints are the firft of a series, in which it is proposed to
repr f.nt the most important events of the American Revolution.
No period of the history of man, is more interesting than that
in which we have lived. The memory of scenes in which were
laid the foundations of that free government, which secures our
national and individual happiness, mult ever remain dear to us,
and to potter it y ; and if national pride be in any cafe juftifia'ple,
Americans have a right to glory 111 having given to the world an
example, whose influence is rapidly spreading the love of free
dom through other nations, and every where ameliorating the
condition of men.
To a (lift in preserving the memory of the illustrious events which
have marked this period of our country's glory, as well as of the
men who have been the most important aflors in them, is the ob
ject of this undertaking Hiftoiy will do justice to an <era so im
portant ; but to be read, the language in -which it is written must
be understoodâthe language of painting is universal, and intelli
gible in all nations, and every age.
As several years of his time, and a very considerable cxpencc,
are necefTary to accomplish this undertaking, it would bean im
prudent fact ifice to the mere hope of reputation to go more deeply
into it, without a probability of ultimate success : âThat he may
j idge of the degree of this probability, Mr. Trumbull, by the ad
vice of his friends, proposes this fubfeription, and flatters himfelf
with a hope of meeting that p?tronage from his countrymen,
which willjuftify his pursuing the objefl with ardor; and with
out which it is impoflible that so expensive a work fliould bccon-
tinned

will be executed of the fame size, and by the moll eminent cn
ravers.
