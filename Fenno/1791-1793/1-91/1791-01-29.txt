NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, OCTOBER 31
M DUBOIS de CRANCEY, in tlie name of
. the Military Committee, submitted to the
consideration of the AH'embly, a plan of a decree
relative to the arming of the French citizens in
habiting the frontiers. He was of opinion, that
no diftimflion (hould be made between the inha
bitants of the towns and those of the country â
that all citizens having-fwoi n to defend the con
JHtution, all have a right to arm in defence of it
âand that if the husbandman did not partake in
the distribution of the national arms, there would
be cause to fear that the inhabitants of towns
â would harrafs those of the country, under pre
tence of keeping thejp within bounds, or of pro
tecting them.
M Dubois, in the name of the Military Com
mittee, moved,
I. That the committee of constitution iliould
present, as soon as poflible to the A Hem My, a
plan for organizing the National Guard* of the
kingdom.
2. That the minifler of war should immediate*
ly be authorised to arm with mufquetsand bayo
nets, every active citizen doing the duty of Na
tional Guard.
3. That the fame minister ftinuld bedefired to
give an account to the AHembly of the obstacles
to the execution of the decree of the 28th July,
relative to the manufacture of new arms.
After some difcuflions, this plan of a decree
was adjourned.
M. Regnauld gave an account, that in the dis
trict of Saint-Jean-d'Angely, the enemies of the
public welfare exerted themselves more than
ever to perl'uade the people that they ought not
to pay taxes. One of these men, who thus blew
the flame of aifcord, being known, was pursued
by the tribunals, and ordered to be taken into
custody. The persons entrulted with the execu
tion of this decree, were accompanied with the
Marechauilee, and twenty-five regulars. The
man was arretted ; but as they were conducting
liiui to prifon,a numerous body of pealants, arm
ed with mufquers, came to his affittance. Firing
took place ou both fides, and many of the insur
gents were killed. The person arretted was
then conducted to prison. On the following day
the inhabitants of the counrry collected ir. great
numbers, with design to oblige the Marechauilee
to open the gates of the prison in which the pri
soner was confined. The Marechauilee opposed
the violation of the law ; but the Mayor, think
ing resistance dangerous, gave orders for libe
rating the prisoner. The people, not content
with this triumph, afiembled and seized the
Mayor, whom they cruelly maflacred.
r lhis affair is again to occupy the attention of
the Afiembly. It was then decreed, that the Af
-I'embly Ihould not have any fitting on Monday,
November I.
A protest ngainft the report made by M. Cha
broud, relative to the affair of the 6;h of Oifto
ber, and confequemly against the decree which
followed upon that occasion, has lately made its
appearance here, signed by a great number of
ariftocrates, in which they have made use of their
former titles of Dukes, Marquifles, Barons, Che
valiers, &c. and M. Serent has taken the title of
Deputy to the States General in behalf of the
NoblefTe of Nivernois.
The substance of it is as follows
" We declare that we disapprove, in toto, of
the report of the procedure of the Chatelet, as
delivered by M. Chabroud, in the name of the
committee of reports.
" We disapprove of ir, because it gives an un
just account of the depositions.
" We disapprove of it, because it appears to
have had no other objed: than to millate fa<fts,
to represent the victims as guilty, to traduce the
â witneiles, to render the tribunal odious, to excuse
the mod horrible attempts, by identifying them
with the operations of the National Afleiubly.
" AVe disapprove of it for fubllitnting, by wav
ofjuftification, an imaginary for a real plot', for
leflening the horror which every Frenchman
should have for a<ftions which criminate the
whole nation while they remain unpuniihed."
LONDON, Nov. 30.
A TITLE rliat has long extindt, is soon
to be revived in one of his Majeffy's Tons,
â viz. thatof Duke of Kent. Prince Edward, (now
Saturday, January 29, 1791.
at Gibraltar) is to be mads Duke of Cumber
land, and the next Prince, Duke of Lancalter.
A considerable part of the late summer and
autumn, has been fpenc by his Majefly in
hunting. The national desire, aud the opinion
of the physicians concur in recommending this
exercise, to prevent him, if polfible, from revert
ing into his late insane situation.
has puzzled some naturalilts to find out what
view nature could have had in creating lizards,
or whether ftie had any view at all. Nothing
(hews the weakness and folly of man more than
such dif'quilitions. It has been lately discovered,
and confirmed in many inltances, that the tail of
a lizard boiled, produces a broth or gravy, which,
after a few times drinking, cures, radically, the
molt inveterare cancer.
The door-money of the late battle of Mendo
za and Humphreys (two noted boxers) amount
ed to the trifling sum of seven hundred pounds.â
The door-money ai a charity sermon at Doncaf
ter, the subsequent Sabbath, amounted to the
sum of jour pounds five Jh'tllings ! So much for the
moral refinement of 1790.
M. de Calonne (fay our French accounts) was
blamed for having given a falfe calculation of
the expences neceli'ary to fiirrourd Paris with a
wall ; according to his estimate fix millions of li
vres would have been fufficient. It now appears
that fifteen millions, or 650 thousand pounds
sterling, will be neccflary to complete the under
taking. Nine millions have already been paid,
and fix millions remain due to the builders.
A boldness of general satire now prevails in
Paris ; nor is it deemed political to endeavur to
suppress it, however strong an inclination there
may be for fucli a measure. Caricature prints of
elevated characters are con tin uall v hawked about,
ar.d bought up with avidity. The kingdom be
ing still in a state of conftifion, the Aflembly think
it better to fuffer the spleen of the difaffected to
evaporate in this manner, rather than by the
more serious means which might take place,
were the publication of those caricatures proln
bited.
Wednesday morning, astheir Royal Highnefl'es
the Prince of Wales and Duke of York followed
the King's carriage just after the review, a fellow
who had climbed up in a tree to fee the fpeifta
cle, cried out, " God bless your Royal tligh
nefles! that's right, take care of your good fa
ther !"
December 3.
THE NETHERLANDS.
ON Tuesday eventning the Duke of Leeds received the-fol
lowing very important communication from Colonel Gardner at
Bruflels, which confirms the news of the fur render of Namur to
the Imperialiftsj and relates the confeqnences which it has pro
duced in every part of the Netherlands.
In our account of yesterday, we stated that General Schoenficld,
the commander in chief of the Belgic troops, had saved himfelf
by flight from the hands ot the Imperialists, and had ai rived at
Brussels. The latter part of this information we si.id to be prema
ture, for the Duke of Leeds's dispatches positively mention thaft
the whole Belgic army in garrison at Namur had -been made pri
soners, and among the reft General Schoenfield. This account is
certainly cot reft', though the particulars of the capture are not yet
known.
But the most important news is, that the Congrefsof BruHVls,
on hearing this intelligence, and that the Imperial army, amount
ing to 40,000 men, under the command of General Bender, was
in hasty march towards Brussels, immediately dispersed and took
to flight. Some of ihe Member* gpt away uriniolefled, but the
populace have seized on Van der Noot, and Van Eupen, the law
yer and the priest, who were endeavoring to escape in difgiiife,
both of whom they held in confinement, and their fate wili soon
prove an example of punishment to others who dare to i.ebej
against their lawful Sovereign, and usurp a Government by the
means of the most barefaced and wicked imposture.
The Imperial troops wereexpefted in BruffeU on Satucdiy lafl.
and the inhabitants are extremely well difpofrdto receive the n.
They wiil find no refiflance in re-taking poffcfliouof the Govern
ment of the Netherlands.
The congress of ambafftdor* at the Hague? for fettling the dif
putcs in Brjbatit, is diflolvcd rather abruptly. The Count .de
Merci d' Argenteau, the Imperial miniftT, had been entreated
by the other members of the Congress !o delay ihe entry yf. tht
Imperial troops into Brabant for davs, which he relufed to
do lor as many hours. The ministers of the three allied oow
crs openly protcftcd against this rash cpndua of M. de AW/, and
the Congiefs broke up. It is however", generally understood thai
Lord Auckland tacitly acquiesced in the proceedings ol this Mi.
riifter.
On thÂ» very moment that the term given by the Emperor ex
pired, the States ot Brabant offered to submit on condition of re
ceiving the Emperor's third Ton as the Sovereign, bat all ojfei;
short of unconditional submission were refufed.
GEORGETOWN, January 19.
On the 13th inft. at Richmond, about 5 o'clock in the th'-
morning, a very severe shock of an earthquake was felt in that
city, which laftod about two minutes; it Ihook the hftufes (o fe
vercly, as to occasion many of the inhabitants to get up to f-e what
damage was done.âAbout the fame time a rumbling noise was
heard in this town, with an intcrmiflion of near half a minute.
The latter part so fevcreas to (hake the hoafes.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THURSDAY, Jan. 13
(Continuedfrom our lajt.)
MR. Smith remarked, that there appeared to
be so great a diversity of opinion on the
fnbje<ft before the house, that he doubted rlie
poiiibility of procuring a majority for either
of the motions that had been made. There
would be objections, he conceived, to any
fition that could be offered ; but the committee
(hould determine 011 that to which there were
few elf. To the Secretary of State he tho't there
were less than to any other officer proposed
Thole againlt the Chief Justice, lie thought un
answerable : Indeed the gentleman who propo
sed him, had not offered any answer to the ob- *
jetftions made to that officer.
The duties of the Prefideju of the Senate, and
those of the President of the United States, ap.
peared to hiin incompatible. The fir ft was tlw
representative of a particular state, and bonnrf
to obey the inftru<ftions of it. If he was to be
deprived of his feat in the his state wotlfcl
lose a vote there, and the balance of that braÂ»S|
of the legiilature would be destroyed.
He recapitulated the objections that had al
ready becnmade tothe Chief Justice's filling the
chair. His power of expounding treaties would
be improperly mixed with that ofmaking them.
1 hat of condemning for offences, with a power
of granting reprieves and pardons. Then the
Chief Juftiie could not atfl with propriety as
commander in chief of the army and navy, h
had been laid, he observed, that the judiciary
business might go on for fonie time without the
uffiftance of the Chief Justice : He thought nor.
There.were three circuit courts, and two judges
for each, including the Chief Justice : If he was
absent, the business of one of the. circuits coukl
nor proceed ; besides he fhoultl preside in the Af
preme court. ,1
He concluded by faying that the office of Se
cretary of State, and the duties of Prefidenr,
were analogous : He was a kind of AHiftant to
the Chief Magistrate, and would therefore very
properly ftipply his place; besides he was always
at the feat of government.
Mr. Burke (aid thai he had conrultpd a gen
tleman Hiilled in the doctrine of chances
who, after considering the fubjecft, had informed
him, that there was an equal chance that luohs a
contingency would not happen more than rt.nce
in 840 years. He hoped therefore thatthe com*
mittee would not spend any more tiine upon.[lie
fubjecS, but postpone it altogether. , , . t
J ' J i o
Mr. Giles conceived chat the probability ofth(
â vent's taking place was much greater than Mr.
Surke seemed ro think. According to the dec
line of policies, he said, ic was not more thanfif
y to one that it would not happen in two months,
iowever, even if the chance was much less, it
vas the duty of the lioufe to make provision for
he accident before it. occured. If it was lefc
ill the cafe actually took place, jt would Uien
>e too late to think of remedying the evil ; for
t was to be provided for by a legiflajivp ntTt,
vhich could upt be made complete without tho
rrefidejit 9 approbation and signature, and coiild
herefore riot be obtained when the chair was
/acant. Then if the event Ihould happen before
t was provided for, there would be, lie ton?
:eivod 3 an end to this.government.
He used another argument to urge thenecellii
ty of a l'peedy provision. Suppol'e, said he, the
Vice-President (ihould die, then the fate of this
government would remain ijj the hands of the
President, who. by resigning would dcitrov its
organization, without leaving a conltitmionai
mode of filling the vacancy.
In addition to the loss of this government,
would not every member of the legiflaryre, he
alked, lose his character, credit and reputation.
Having fiiewn the neceflity of making iminer'
diate provision for a cafe of so much importance
to the very existence of the government, Mr, Gile?he was in favor of filling tip tlie blank
with the Secretary of State He chiefly rested
his opinion on the idea, that if the constitution
had siot intended that the vacancy should be fil
led by fonie officer not there mentioned, they
would have determined who it fliould be.
Mr. Sedgwick was sorry that the bafinefs had
been brought forward, and more so that gentle
men ihould discover a zeal on the occalion, which
indicated too much of taking a personal iu;.erell
in the question.
He did not apprehend the consequences which
would follow, if the accident Ihould occur,
would be so dreadful as the gentleman la.lt up
appeared to think. There was more danger, he
conceived, in ruffling men's tempers now, by de
signating one officer heir apparent (if he might
be allowed the expreflion) to the office of chief
magistrate.
He objected to filling up the blank with the.
Secretary of State ; it would be putting in the
hands of the President (orof the Vice-President)
a power of appointing his fuccefi'or. The au
thority with which the Chief Justice is veiled,
the refpe<fl which his station commands, and his
independence, induced hini, he said, at firfl to
think him the most proper person to be at the
head of affairs in cafe of vacancy in the chief
magistracy.âHowever, if it could not be agreed
to postpone the business, he should now vote for
the President of the Senate pro tern.
Mr. Benfon said that an honorable gentleman
(Mr. Smith) hadremarked, that he had not at
tempted to anfvver the objections which were
made to the Chief Justice's being designated to
fill the vacancy, and had drawn the conclusion
that the objections were unanfvverable. He was
sensible that there might and would be objec
tions to any officer that could be mentioned ;
but those against the Chief Justice he did not
think unanswerable. It had been objedted that
there would be an impropriety in his condemn
ing as Chief Justice, and pardoning as President.
But something like this is frequently the cafe.
He supposed that whoever exercised the office of
Chief Magistrate, would for the time resign his
firft office. He only mentionedthis to ftiew that
the obje<slions made to the Chief Justice had not
been answered not because they were deemed
â unanswerable ; But his wish was to fee the va
fcancy filled by an independent officer ; he had
no objection to the President of the
Senate pro tern.
Mr. Jackson moved that the consideration of
this business be postponed, which was agreed to.
The committeerofe and reported.
WEDNESDAY, Jan. 26.
Sundry petitions were read and referred to the
heads of departments.
Mr. Sedgwick, ffrom the committee appoint
ed for that purpose, reported a bill, providing
compeni'ations for infpe&ors and officers by them
appointed, which was read the fir 11 time.
The bill providing for the renewal of loft cer
tificates, was read the f'econd time, and referred
ro a committee of the whole, on Tliurfday the 3d
of February.
A message was received from the President of
United States, accompanied with the following
copies of a letter, addressed to him by the Presi
dent of the National Assembly of France, and of
a decree of that Aflembly, transmitted with it.
Mr. President,
The National Assembly has worn, during three
days, mourning for Benjamin Franklin,your fel
low citizen, your friend, and one of the most
ufeful of your co-operators in the eftablifhinent
of American Liberty. They charge me to com
municate their resolution to the Congress of the
United States. In consequence, I have the honor
to address to you, Mr. President, theextracft from
the proceedings of their felfion of the nth, which
contains the deliberation.
The National Aflembly have not been Hopped
in their decree by the consideration that Frank
lin was a llranger men are the fathers
of universal humanity their loss ought to
be felt, as a common misfortune, by all the tribes
of the great human family ; and it belongs, with
out doubt, to a nation still affected by all the sen
timents, which accompany the, achievement of
their liberty, and which owesirs.enfranchifement
effimuall'y to the progress of the public reason,
to be the firft to give the exafllgle of the filial
gratitude of the people towards "their true b'ene
fa<ftors besides that these ideas, iand this exam
ple, are lb proper to difleminate a happy emula
tion of patrotifm, and thus to extend more and
more the empire of reason and virtue, \vhich
could not fail promptly to determine a body, de
voted to the most important legislative combina
tions ; charged with assuring to the French the
rights of men, Sindcitizens ; it has believed, with
out doubt, that fruitful and great truths were
likewise numbered among the rights of man.
i he name of Benjamin Franklin will be im
mortal in the records of freedom and philofopliy :
but it is more particularly dear to a country,
where, conducted by the most sublime million,
this venerable man knew very soon to acquire an
infinite numbo- of friends and admirers, as well
by the fimpliity and sweetness ot his manners,
as by the puriy of his principles, t le exten o
his knowledge and the charms of his mind.
It will be remembered, that every success,
which he obt:ined in his important negociation,
was applauded a:Â«d celebrated ;fo to expie s it .
all over France, as so many crowds conferred on
genius and virtue. ,
Even then the sentiment of our rights exiited
in the bottom of our fouls. It was ealily P el^ e . 1N
ed, that it feelingly mingled in the inte) elt w 111
we took in behalf of America, and in the public
vows, which we preferred for your liberty.
At lalt the hour of the French lias an ived -
we love to think, that the citizens ofthe Unite
States have not regarded with indifference out
steps towards liberty. Twenty-fix millions ol
men, breaking their chains, and seriously occupi
ed in giving themselves a durable conititution,
are not unworthy theefteem ot a generous people
who have preceded them in that noble careei.
We hope, they will learn, with interest, the
funeral homage, which we have rendered to the
Nestor of America. May this solemn aift of fra
ternal friendfliip serve more and more to bind
the tie, which ought to unite two free nations !
May the common enjoyment of liberty shed itfelf
over the whole globe, and become an indillolu
ble chain of connexion among all the people of
the earth ! For ought they not to perceive, that
they will inarch more ftedfaftly and more cer
tainly to their true happiness, in understanding
and loving each other, than in being jealous and
fighting ?
May the Congress of the United States, and
the National Aflembly of France, be the firft to
furnifh this fine fpe(ftacle to the world ! and may
the individuals of the two nations connect them
selves by a mutual affetflion, worthy ofthe friend
fhip which unites the two men, at this day most
illustrious by their exertions for libertyâlVASh-
JNGTONand LA FAYETTE !
Permit me, Mr. Prefidcnt, to offer, 011 this oc
casion, my particular homage of esteem and ad
miration. I have the honor to be,
With refpe<ftful confidpration,
Mr-. I'refident,

ExtraCi from the Leyden Gazettt of Nov. 19
" Letters from Nanci mention the unwelcome
news ofthe death of M. Defilles, the brave young
officer who tied himfelfto the moutiÂ»of a loaded
cannon on the 31 11 August, to prevent the muti
nous garrison of Nanci, from firing on the nati
onal troops. The wounds he received in that af
fair, have been the cause of his death. At Nan
ci it is regarded as a public loss, and a cause of
"liio&rning to thÂ« whole city. Doubt lefc every
Frenchman, every man, whose saul is not steeled
to every sentiment of patriotism and humanity,
will feel emotions of grief and regret at the ear
ly death of a citizen, for whom all Nanci is in
tears. His name, which is already ranked with
the noblell in antiquity,will descend with their's
to the latest posterity, and obscure them in its
superior lustre, by the remembrance ofthe noble
a(ftion in which he facrificed his life to the peace
of his country. Let us contrast the conduit of
this young man with that of those Infernals, in
the fhapesof men, who, with deliberate coolness
can scheme scenes of disorder, anarchy, and ven
geance, merely to gratify their ambitious views,
and add, they care not how much, to the miseries
of man.âThe National Aflembly in a letter di
re&ed to the friends of M. Defilles, have condo
led with them on the loss of so excellent a ci
tizen.
Philadelphia, Jan. 29.
Extrntt oj a letter from a gentleman at Fayetteville (N. C.) to a member
oj Congrefsy dated 15th December, 1790.
" I am now to inform you that the feflion of our Aflembly is
drawing to a period ; the adjournment fine die will take place this
eveniug. Next feflion is to be held at Newbern, the fiift Monday
in December next.
" Among the various bufmefs agitated this feflion, has been
that of subscribing the state securities now in the treasury to the
loan piopofed by Congress, and of opening an office for purchas
ing up the remaining debt, whereby the treasury might become
poflefled of a fufficient sum to fubferibe the whole amount to be
afTumed for this state ; but this scheme, I am happy in faying, has
not succeededâthe bill for the purpose is laid over, by a respec
table majority, to next aflembly, which by the bye will not hap
pen until two months after the fubfeription books are closed.
The beneficial effects of this decision already begin to.be experi
enced by the few who have had faith or obstinacy enough to in
duce them to hold up their certificatesâftate securities have risen
50 per cent, in twenty-four hoursâthe information will be im
mediately difleminated by the members among their constituents,
and we lhall henceforth know how to set a value upon the lmall
portion of certificates, out of which the knowing ones have not here
tofore duped us. Another circumstance which operates in favor
of our certificates is, that the report of the Comptroller, made to
the present Aflembly, states the amount in circulation to be barely
fufficient to fill the loan ; in which statement is included one-half
the Warrenton emiflion, which we all know are not attainableâ
so that we have the fulleft aflurance the whole of our fubferiptions
will be aflumed. The Commifli*ner of loans has made applica
tion for the checks, by which to examine the certificates prefentcd
to be loaned ; his request has been negatived ; but at the fame
time a resolution was adopted, allowing him access to them, pro
vided he would go where they are (viz. Hillfborough) which we
have no doubt will be the cafe; as we cannot harbour a thought
that the Secretary of the Treasury, in whom we have the highest
confidence, will permit to become stationary in so remote a cor
ner of the State aa is Edenton, an office, established as well for
the general good and accommodation of the citizcns of the State,
as for the United States.
<Â£ Along with ihe foregoing information fuller me to intrude
the following, which, for the information of the concerned to the
Northward and Eastward, it may perhaps be well to publilh in
the newspapers of your city, as the Ast itfelf mav not find its
way among them iri due time : A Law has palled this feflion, for
doing an ast of justice to the holders of certificates, illued for just
claims by the Coinmiflioiiers of Army Accounts at Warrenton,
in the year 1786 ; by this Ast the Agent tor fettling the accounts
of this State, with the United States, is required to make return to
the Treasurer of the State, by the firft of May Dext, of all the set
tlements made by the said Commissioners in 1786, diftinguithing
the just from the unjust, the holders of Certificates are to bring
them in to the Treasury, before or at the next feflion of AlTembly,
and the I reafurer is to ilTue new Certificates of like tenor for all
such as (hall appear to have been fairly obtained. The ast ex
pires at the riling of the Assembly, and such who IHall not by that
period have presented their claims are foiever precluded."
Thursday an express arrived at the War-Office of th* 1 United
States, from the Western country. J*
The following extract of a letter trom Capt. Zcigler, dated Foi
Harmar, January 8, to the Secretary at War, contains the substance
of the intelligence brought by the express.
" I AM extremely sony to inform you, that the settlement
called Big Bottom, twenty miles up tKe Mulkingum, from this
pbft, was cut off by the Sivages on the ad- instant. Eleven men
and two children were kilied ; two men who were quartered in a
cabbiu a small distance from the Block-House escaped ; three men
it is supposed, are taken prisoners as bodies are not found.
Extract of a letter from Marietta, to a Member oA
Cougrefs, dated Jan. 6, 1791.
" When the settlers of this region had pui
chafed their lands and removed hither, they ha
not the least apprehension, that they had any di!
ficulties to encounter, except thofeof an unculti
vated foilâplacing all faith and confidence ii

itâbeing as it were under the necellity of laying
out that which they received as pay for their past
services, in land, 1110 ft of the settlers here confi-i
der their purchase as bought with their blood :l
But, Sir, is it possible we lliouid have purchafecD
lands, which we cannot improve, by reason of a'
savage enemy, whom the United States can ex
tirpate with a nod ?âNo. Surely we shall have
help in due time. You have doubt had the
particulars of the attack 011 the unfortunate fet
rlement up the Mu&inguai.âThe groans of your,
flanghtered dyingcounrymenâthe lamentation/
of parents for the loss of their beloved fonsâthi
indignity offered to the United States by those
savages' murdering her sons, who were peaceably
improving the land she had fold them, will rouse
the indignation of the American Eagle, and pour 1
speedy vengeance on the guilty heads of those
murderers, who received not the least provoca
tion, but 011 the contrary every friendly office in
our pover. It is not my province to enquire in
to the particulars of the late expedition ; but this
1 can fay with propriety, that it has not had the
defii ed effetftâfor in place of humbling, it only
irriv?tedâand instead of a partial, it has produ
ced a general WAR. To whom have we to look
for help and protection from the enemy, but to
the general government, whom, next to God, arel
the fathers and guardians of the lives and pro-/
perries of the people."

A vote of thanks to the four Senators of the

A certain distinguished chara&er in the United States, wrote a
book on the fubjeft of government.â*-He founded his fyoem on the
experience of mankind,in all couutries and agesâand the invaria
ble principles of human natureâthe great obje&s of this work,are
to devise the most effettual barrjers to the encroachments of arbi
trary power, and the most perfect fafeguards to liberty. A cor
respondent observed, that in a late debate on the excise bill, the
principles of this work were very fully recognized ; when it was
urged as a reason for a certain amendment proposed to the bill,
" that human nature is always the fameâwhat has been, will be
againâand that experience is the only infallible guide in legisla
tion when the principles of emulation, rivaMhip and ambition
are brought forward as the great moving causes of aÂ£lion to the
human mind, and a ballanced government is urged as the natural
and neceflary result ; it is very fafhionable to hear persons fay,
that modern human nature, is so very different a thing from ancient
human nature, that it will be universally found in future, I hat

The excise bills as it is termed, now before
Congreis, has met with much undeserved cen
tre troin a;i erroneous idea, that thofc men who
strenuously oppoled the fame fyilem of taxation
previous to the revolution, and. wliofe oppofuion
to the measures of the British government were
the cause of the liberty we now enjoy, would acit
inconfiftentjy by favoring a fyfteni of taxation

dependent of the wide difference between the
principles of the bill now before Congress, and
the British excise ; it may justly be oblei ved,'that
there exists some difference in bearing a burden
inipofed by a government in which we had no
paticipation, and in paying a tax laid by our im
mediate representatives, and for the support of
a government of our own choice. Gen. Adv.
The only plausible objection against the as
sumption of the excise by the general government,
is a supposition that the impost will so encreale,
that no other additional revenue will be wanted
âbut this objection excludes all idea of linking
any part of the principal of the public debt ot*
making a certain provision to pay the interest a
greeable to the plighted faith of the United States
âor of a ruinous clashing of jurisdictions, in
cafe the states fhonld separately renew their ex
cif'e fyltems, ifCongrefs (hould wave the right to
that source of revenue.

where is the spot in those States which have fur

said the present glorious revolution of France
owes its rile in a great measure to the gentle

Should o'er herb ight compeers in beauty rife,
In make and motion high 3bovc the reft,
Sov'reign of hearts and queen of love confef&'d.

For universal war of go J s and men.
A higher theme has now all hearts inclin'd,
Not who's the faircft form, but brightest mind,
And hark, how loud the mental contest rings!
Apollo's hand has set the tuneful firings,
Phi len i a's verse his living lyre divine
Admits, and calls upon the sacred nine
To name the fair pre-eminent in song,
To whose mild voice the dulcet notes belong.
To such enchantress he'll consign the lyre,
The bright credential of superior fire ;
From whose ftritt chords the diapason clear,
Mellifluous deep, shall charm th' arrested ear.
Extatick airs, that hymn the morning ray,
The lark's full note, and linnet's lighter lay,
Shall emulate Phi lenia's song in vain,
Pier heav'nly harp sublime and seraph strain.
And hence shall bigot pride conieft no more
The sex's equal claim to claflic lore.
Mean is the man who never can bestow
A leaf of laurel to a female brow ;
When sterling sense and tuneful di&ion join'd,
Are the twin-offspring of a female mind.
From Albion's cliffs what tides of music flow,
When heart struck Seward pours the plaint of woe,
When Carter's modulated numbers roll,
And Moor e and Aiki n moralize the foul.
O woman, favorite of the fowling skies !

the Rajah, Tifipo is said to have been defeated, with the Joss of
1300 menâand in a he is said to have afTaulted the Rajah
lines with incredible ferocity and bravery, and after a long con
test, obtained a victory. The Rajah of Travtncore is a (lifted by
