FROM THE GENERAL AD'/ERTISER.
Mr. Bache,
ACCORDING to prouiife I fend yon the peti
tion, and afl'ure you that the subscription
goes on rapidly; iooo having signed already.â
The total number of 10,000 is deemed fufficient,
although twice as many might easily be obtained.
The proceeding has been scrupulously candid ;
not one having set down her name without a
careful perusal of the contents. Much less have
absent or fictitious persons been added to the lift,
or school-boys and other trumpery taken in.
Your friend, C.
To the Honorable Congress of the United
7'he humble Address of ten thou/and Federal Maids
With a blufli of female modelty we present
this refpedtful address, in hopes that our federal
voice may in fonie degree fofteii the clamour of
discontent that Ituns your ears. We are grieved
to lee, that a glorious empire cemented by the
blood of gallant fellow-citizens, fathers and bro
thers, is jet in danger from licentious discord;
and we make you a folenin tender of all the aid
that faithful female hearts can give. Phlegmatic
pedants and flirting beaus may ridicule this lan
guage as the efFufion of enthusiasm ; we scorn
Â«rÂ» &
the paltry beings who never felt the sublimity
and ardor of our country's facred love. We repeat
again, command our utmost efforts for the public
good. If the men will not fuffer your excise to
touch their darting grog, excess in which does
evety year destroy thousands, brings many hun
dred families to beggary, and breaks the hearts
of many amiable wivesâtax then freely our fa
vorite tea, our caps, bonnets, cushions, biihops,
every piece of ornamental dress. If Hill more is
wanted, tax our very under-petticoats. If our
young men will not learn how to defend their li
berty and property, their hoary fire, the mother
who bore and suckled themâthen order lis into
the field. We shrink indeed from violence ; fonie
of us cannot without pain kill a chicken : But
alas, tlie sword is yet in this civilized tera, the
ultima ratio. This charming country may invite
bold invaders ; it may breed vipers in its bosom.
This land of liberty tnuftbe defended against fo
reign and domestic foes. Some of us are of tlie
society called Friends, and we all refpedt the civil
virtues of this society; but we cannot believe
that a man does please the righteous judge of
mankind, and father of mercies, by fuffering a
savage to scalp his child, or burn the viife of his bosom
in flow fires. We all know the value of national
industry ; but gold must be defended by fleet. In
dependence muftnot be hazarded merely to make
an apprentice work some additional days more
in tlie year for his mailer. Learning is both
tifeful and ornamental to nations : But do not
our scholars know, that Minerva -was the Coddefs
of arms as -well as arts? Some of us will never
marry a fellow who cannot protedl his fweet
lieart, although he could chaunt all the battles
of Homer in Greek.
Your petitioners revere tlie rights of consci
ence. They know also that general regulations
require modification ; but every good citizen will
cliearfully bear his portion of the public burden ;
if he cannot fight, he will pay; if he drinks a
gieat deal, lie will not grudge the price of his
enjoyment.
Finally, as those that sow have a right to reap,
your petitioners request with due fubtuiffion a
few small privileges: as an order offemale hereifm,
like that of the Cincinnati ; the right of election
to all public offices ; and especially an absolute
command over non-paying and non-fighting hujbands.

their trust in order to obtain that power. At
present, you seem in every thing to have strayed
out of the high road of nature. The property
of France ddes not govern it. Of course proper
ty is destroyed, and rational liberty has no exist

a paper circulation, ai)d a stock-jobbing conttitu

that the territory of France, upon the republican
system of eighty-three independent municipali
ties (to fay nothing of the parties that compose
them) can ever be governed as one body, or can
ever be set in motion, by the impulse of one
mind ? When the National Aflembly has com

ruin. These commonwealths will not long bear
a Hate of fubje<flion to that of Paris. They will
not bear that this one body ihould monopolize
the captivity of the King, and the dominion over
the Afletnbly calling itfelf National. Each will
keep its own portion of the spoil of the church
to itfelfâand it will not even fuffer that spoil, or
the more just fruits of their industry, or the na

insolence, or pamper the luxury of the mechanic

country like this, therefore, to erect and concentrate and pern,
tuate a large mo tiled mtereft, i, a measure, which your memori ll
' apprehend roust, in the couife of human events, produce our
or other of two evils. The proftrotion of agticultu-e at the feu
of commerce, or a change m the present form of federal govern
ment, fatal to the exigence of American liberty.
The General Alfembly pafsby various other parts of the fubiefr
which they apprehend will have a dangerous and impolitic ten
dency, and proceed to (hew the injustice of it, as it applies to this
Commonwealth. It pledges the faith of the United States for the
payment ofceriain debts due by the several States in the Union
contrasted by them during the late war. A large proportion of
the debt thus coutrafted by this State has been already redeemed
by the collection of heavy taxes levied on its citizens, and mca
fures have been taken for the gradual payment of the balance. f 0
as to afford the-molt certain prolpeft of extinguiihing the whole
at a period not very distant ; but by the operation ofthe aforefai-l
aft-, a heavy debt, and confcquently heavy taxes will be iritailtd
on the citizens df this commonwealth, from which thev never can
be relieved by all the efforts of the General Airembly, whilst any
part of the debts contiafled by any State in the American Union,
and so assumed, Itaall remain unpaid : For it is with great anxietv
your memoria-lifts perceive, that the said ast, withont thefma:;-
cft neceflity, is calculated to extort from the General Affeiably
the power us taxing their own condiments for the payment of their
own debts, in fuel) a manner as would be bell suited to tlicir own
ease and convenience.
Your memorialing cannot suppress their uneasiness at the dis
criminating preference which is given to the holders of the prin
cipal of the continental debt, over the holders of the principal of
the State debts, in ihole instances, where Stales have made ample
provision for the annual payment of the inteieft, and where of
course there can be no interest to compound with principal, which
happens to be the filuation of this Commonwealth. The con
tinental creditors have preferences in oiher refpefts, which *I. e
General Aftembly forbear to mention, fatisfied, that Congress mull
allow that policy, justice, and the principles of public credit ab
hor difcrimination'a between fair creditors.
Your tnemorialifls turn away from the impolicy and iniuftice
of the said ast, and view it in another light, in which to lh:m it
appears still more odious and deformed.
During the wholedifcuflion of the federal constitution by the
convention of Virginia, your memorialists were taught to believe,
" that every power not granted was letained." Under this im
preflion andupon this positive condition declared in the instru
ment of ratification, the said government was adopted by the peo
ple of this commonwealth ; but your memorialists can find fw>
clause in the constitution, authonfing Congress to ailume the debts
of the States! As the guardians then of the rights and intcrefis
ot their constituents, as centmels placed by them over the minis
ters ot the federal government, to lhield it from their encroach
ments, or at least to found the alarm when it is threatened with in.
vafion, they can never reconcile it to their confeiences, silently to
acqui, fee in a measure which violates that hallowed maxim. A
maxim, on the truth and facrcdnefs of which, tie federal govern
ment depends for its adoption in this commonwealth. But this
injurious ast not only deserves the censure of the General Airem
bly, becaule it is not warranted by the constitution of the United
States, but because it is repugnant to an express piovifion of that
constitutionâthis provision is " That all debts contrasted and
engagements entered into before the adoption of this constitution,
ftiall be valid against the United States under this constitution, as
undei the confederation," which amounts to a constitutional ra
tification of the contrasts refpefting the State debts, in the Situa
tion in which they existed under the confederation. And resort
ing to that standard, there can be no doubt, that in the prcftrit
question, the rights of States as contracting parties with the Uni
ted States, must be confidercd*as sacred.
The General Assembly of the commonwealth of Virginia, con
fide so fully in the justice and wisdom of Congress upon tlie prc
fent occasion, as to hope they will rcvife and amend the aforefaid
ast generally, and repeal in particular, so much of it as relates
to the ailuinption of the State debts.

L O N D O N, Nov. 26.
ON the evening of the jth inft. the Sovereign
Congress at Bruflels assembled at the Town
houfe at Nainur, where they received the citizens ;
after the President, in an animated lpeech,had ad
drefledthem refpedtirig the Emperor's Manifefto,
he, in the name of the Sovereign Congress, re
quefled their sentiments, which were delivered by
one of their head, who spoke to the following
effect:
" We have considered the Emperor's Mani
fefto, which I have the honour to inform you the
citizens of Bruflels not only rejeifl but difpife ;
the people have drawn the fvvord in the cause of
God and their country, nor will they ever {heath
it but in the bodies of their enemies !
" They are firm and determined, they have
and will most chearfully expend the last portion
of their property in support of their's and their
posterity's liberty! They beseech you,therefore,
high and mighty Lords, to adt with zeal and at
tachment in your several august stations ; for
lhould a link of your great chain give way, our
cause must fall to ruin.
I lie Manifefto was then ordered to be produc
ed ac the table, where ic was pricked by the sword
of the President, and head of the people,and then
burnt in form.
This appeal from Congress to the people, has
been ordered to take place all over the States,
and there is but one voice, frcsdom or dtath.
A proclamation was ifl'ued, offering a pension
of twenty florins per ann. and a silver medal, tÂ«every soldier fervlng the term of 3 years, from j
the Ift of December next. â¢ v I
A very extraordinary appointment liasjul. ta- |

Dutere has been nominated Keeper of the Seals,
in the place of the Arclibilliop of Bourdeaux.
This Gentleman has been a Clerk to M. BaiUy,
the Mavor of Paris, and thusf'uddenly partes from
en income of fifty, to a revenue of four thousand
livres per annum. _

though the body of them cannot speak theiu
felves, yet paid a proper compliment to thole
that can in .the perfuu of Mr. Erlkine, who in a
late trip to Paris was hoiioured with a dilun
<ruifhed feat in the center of the Aflembly.
Â° Were Mr. Burke to appear in Paris, the French
would probably honour him with a lantern, ior
the light he has thrown 011 their revolution.
Dr. Price has done himi'elf so little good by
aflerting the rights of men, that he might as well
have fullered them quietly to have blundered on
in their own way.
How can the National Aflembly boalt ot its
zeal for the rights of manâof its justice and its
humanity, when, standing 011 the ruins of the
Baftile, it fuffers the employment of torture and
the wheel.
Burke's Pamphlet has jufV made its appearance
here ; the aristocratic party are devouring it.
The Abbe Dupaty in quoting Monf. Necker,
pays him a compliment at once elegant andjuft :
<< 1 have seen the " Administration of the Fi

has read that workâevery man who thinks, va
lues it; every man who feels, is enthusiastic in its
favour. And, in fatft, how important are its
principles ! How deep its reflections '.-How
just its ideas ! Its style is truly that of the ftiaf
terly writer.âlt breathes too a sacred love for
the liappinel's of mankind. This book fliall re

The restoration of the Prince Bifliop of Liege
could not have been effeifted without the tacit

great pomp, whenever a circumfiance like this

of Mr. Bruce, this embafly may prove of nofinall
advantage to the English Supercargoes fettled
there. Mr. Bruce carries with him foine very
â valuable presents as offerings on the occasion.
A MEDAL. The Liberty of the Press
THE very unwarrantable attack which has
lately been made upon this great engine of all
our liberties, civil and political, theprefs, has in
duced a number of gentlemen to request that a
medal may be struck in honor of an illustrious jury
of Ireland, who by their verdidt, eftabliflied that
truth was not a libel, insensible contradiction to
the fyftero laid down to us by Lord Mansfield.
Mr. Gray, of Sackville-ftreet, is to give the design,
which will be equally spirited and. just. Every
man literary, or not, who feels as he ought to do
for the liberty of the press, attempted to be borne
down by acftions at law, is requeited to fignify
his intentions of subscribing, to Mr. Ridgway,
Bookseller, at the Prince of Wales's Head, York

al, thus instituted in honor of the late jury of
Ireland.

MIDDLETWON, Jan. ij
Extrafl of a letter from Capt. Jonathan Hart, dated
Fort-Harmar, Dec. 8, I 79 o- to the Pa-
rents and friends of Lieut. Frothingham.
The Serjeant who belqnged tothe party which
Lreut. Frotliingham particularly commanded,
fays, while they were retreating Lieut. Frothing
ham call'd to him, faying, " I am wounded, you
must take charge of the men." A foldierwho be
longing to the fame party, fays he was along fide
of Lieut. Frotliingham in the retreat, palled a
large stream, but did not observe that he was
wounded ; a militia soldier adds, he saw him af
ter he pafled the Itream and that he was taking
command of the men ; but another soldier fays
he saw him fitting near the banks of the river,*
pale, bleedmg, and said he was mortally wound-;
ed. From every circumstance I conclude lie wr.s
wounded before he palled the river ; but did not
bleed so much as to prevent making every eltort
to repulse the enemy, until further refinance e
came impracticable, and that by this time the
loss of blood had nearly doled the ftene and com
pelled him to feat himfelf and calmly to wait: the
expiring moment. There is a poilibilit> ot ns
being ltill alive, but I presume to hear he had
calmly reflgned his life to the great proprietor ot
all nature would be less gloomy than to entertain
the alarming idea of his being alive and fubjeU
to all the cruelties of more than lavage barban
ans, particularly under that full allin ance winch
every one acquainted with him mult have, that
according to the bell of his abilities, he had per
formed the part assigned by the great director
and answered every pui pose lor which lie came
into this world, and that he mud be now lately
landed on the blifsful fliore of a happy eternity.
'â¢ Permit me to mingle a sympathizing tear
with the parents, relations and friends to his me
mory, and add as a tribute due from me to him,
that as a mail of abilities to which he had added
a handsome education, as a confidential acftive
and persevering officer, his death is moil sincerely
lamented in the army, and as a member of socie
ty, 111 him we have to lament the 1 ols of an amia
ble example of every moral and social viitue.
* Another' letter fays,âthat at this place he dejn'-
ed the ferjeant to take charge of the men, adding, that
hs had received a fecottd wound.

IN Committee of the whole, on the bill, declar
ing the person, who, in cafe of the death, in
ability, removal or resignation of the President,
and Vice-President, shall exercise the office ot Pre
sident of the United States.
Mr. Carrol renewed the motion, that the va
cancy in fach cafe be filled by the Secretary of
State for the time being.
Mr. Livermore observed, that the chara&er of
the gentleman who fills that office should have no
weight in determining the question, because tl.e
house was about lo provide for a cafe that niig' u
not happen before a number of years were elap
sed.
The house lhould fix on the officer who wouW>
from the nature of his officc, inolt naturally f uc "
ceed. He hoped they would not determine in
favor of an officer of their own creating, and ot
which no mention is made in the constitution.
The Chief Jullice, he remarked, had been fpÂ°"
ken ofâone great objetfiion he mentioned again*
him, the provision which the constitution makes
in cafe the President is impeached, viz. that he
ftould prefule. ,
As this was an elective government, he wilhe
its principles preserved, and not to fee the chie
magistracy filled by an officer, not the choice o

When amendments to the Conflitution came to
be thought of, perhaps it would be proper, he said,
to provide for this cafe by a fpccial clause in it,
impowering the electors, who had chosen the
President and Vice-Prefulent, in cafe of vacancy,
to meet again, and make another choice, only,
however, for the remainder of the four yeais ;
because at the end of that time the power of chu
fing theeleiitors ibould return to, and be exercil'ed
by the several Hates.
If the motion before the committee was nega
tived, he gave notice, that he would bring in his,
viz. to fill up the blank with the perfonlalt ante
cedently chosen President ofrhe Senate.
Mr. Baldwin said that he fliould vote for the
present motion, because lie conceived that the
conftitiuion is express, that an officer of the go
vernment, c'efignated either by the law or the
Conititmion, should be appointed to fill this va
cancy.
He dated some objeiflions against the Chief
Justice : He is an officer who ought to be entire
ly detached from all political agitations whatev
er : His mind oughtto be kept calm, and as un
embarrafled as poifible : He quoted the precedent
cftablifhed in the law, instituting the governor
of the We,tern Territoryâthere the secretary
is to succeed the governor. The secretary of
slate is an executive officer, an affiltant to the
President, and mult be supposed, from his situa
tion, to be the moil proper per foil to supply the
vacancy.
Mr. Sherman was of opinion, that putting the
chief magistracy into the hands of a subordinate
officer was by no means proper. As to the ob
servations made by the gentleman last up on the
arrangements in the government of the Western
Territory, he did not think they could be ap
plied to the present cafe : That government was
a subordinate one, and a kind of legislative pow
er was veiled in tlie governor, of fele&ing from
the laws, and regulations of the different States
such as he thought requisite for the goverjiment
of ihofe he had under-his care.
He was in favor of giving the fupreine execu
tive in cafe of accident, to the Prelident of the
Senate : The government would certainly fuffer
fevver inconveniences by that arrangement than
if the head of a department was put in. The
Vice-President, by the conilitution succeeds to
the President ; the President of the Senate to the
office of the firft, it is therefore very natural
that he fliould also exercise the duties ot the le
cond in cafe of vacancy
To designate any officer, as poflible fucceflor
o the President, he said, would be giving him
:oo much dignity, and raising liini in a manner
:ven above the legUlature.
Mr. Carroll observed that the vacancy might
happen in the recess of the legislature, or in the
abfenceof the President of the Senate: the Se
cretary of State would always be at the feat of
government. Besides the conllitution declared
the vacancy should be filled by an officer of the go
vernment ; the President of the Senate was on
ly an officer pro tern. If the framers of the con
llitution had intended the vacancy should be filled
by an officer named in it, they could have de
fignaied hiin ; but this they had not done ; he
therefore supposed they had in view some officer
then not in exiftencc.
Mr. Gerry regretted that the ,fubje<ft iTiould
have been taken up at this moment, when so much
important business is before Congress. He advert
ed to the motion, and said, that the character
which now fills the office of Secretary of State,
undoubtedly poilelled the confidence of the legi
slature in ihe fulleft mannerâand very justlyâ
but when the exigency {hall arrive for which we
now are about to provide, a character may fill
that office, who would be a fceurge to the Union.
Besides said he, if the office of Vice-Preiident was
now to be filled, the Secretary of State would be
ineligible, coming from the fame State wth the
President. He itated other objections from the
Constitution : He thought thenomination ftiould
not be confined to officers of the U.S. He supposed
the views of government may be extended even tg
officers of the several StatesâHe however wished
the whole business postponed ; but if this idea is
over ruled, he fuggelted the propriety of filling
the blank with the conilitutional clause relpeifi
ingthe highest candidates who are primarily vo
ted for as President and Vice-Prefident.

United States, January 24, 1791.
Gentlemen of the Senate,
and lioufe oj ReprefentativeSy
IN execution of the powers with -which Congress were
pleased to invest me, by their ast, entitled, " An ast for cftablifh
ingthe temporary and permanent feat of the government of the
United States." and on mature consideration of the advantages and
disadvantages of the several positions, within the limits preieribed
by the said ast, I have, by a Pioclamation, bearing date this day,
a copy of which is herewith transmitted, directed CÂ«mmiflioners,
appointed in pursuance of the ast, to survey and limit a part of the
territory of ten miles fcjuare, on both fides the river Potowmac,
so as to comprehend Georgetown in Maryland, and to extend to
the Eadcrn Branch.
I have not, by this firft ast, given to the said territory the whole
extent, of which it is fulceptible, in the direction of the river ; be
caiife I thought it important, that Congress should have an oppor
tunity of conlidering,whether, by an emendatory law, they would
author ife the location of the residue at the lower end of the present,
so as to comprehend the eastern branch iifelf, and some of the
country on its lower fide in the state of Maryland, and the town
of Alexandria in Virginia. If however they are of opinion, that
the federal territory should be bounded by the water-edge of the
Eastern Branch, the location of the residue will be to be made at
the upper end of what is now directed.
I have thought best to await a survey of the territory, before it
is decided, on what particular spot, on the north-eallern fide of
the river, the public buildings shall be erected.
The lioufe then resumed the consideration of
amendments proposed to the new revenue bill.
Three additional feiflions refpe<fling the ap

the bill, which were offered on Saturday, after

Philadelphia, Jan. 26.
It is to be remarked that the oppofers of-tlie
revenue bill now before Congress, have never
come forward with a competent substitute .
Something has been said about a tax on law pro
ceedings, by which it is supposed a ftanip duty
was intended, and a direct tax has been faintly
whisperedâbut both these are found to fhriuk
from the touchstone of popularity.
The symptoms of aristocracy in the Eastern
States, areâagrarian lawsâ'simplicity of manners
âequality of circuinftancesâa universal diffufiou
of the means of knowledgeâpublic schools being
eftabli/hed by law, and I'upported by a general
tax throughout the country âelections by ballot,
and consequently free, being held on one, and
the fame day in Imall diftritfts, throughout the
refpediive governments âthe foil cultivated by
its independent ownersâreverence for the laws
âand refpe<it to their magistratesâthe federal
government veneratedâand the statutes of Con
gress obeyedâhappy and tranquil because they
are informed and fres âand because they poflefs
the means of preserving their freedom, by malt*
ing every man, from jixteen to forty, a soldier-ci
tizen :âBut the most alarming of all their symp
toms of Aristocracy is, the silence of their repre
sentatives in Congress, in refpedj; to the jealous,
uneasy, turbulent spirit of their conftitueius, as
to any law that the general government may, in
their wisdom, enaift.
It is a trite observation, that anticipation of
evil, is often the forerunner of mifchief : We
have, however, been happily disappointed in
times pastâNo thanks to the dismal cacklers of
the capitol. As the good sense of the people has
hitherto prevented them from imbibing a restless
spirit of complaint, from the oft repeated, tho
groundless jealousies and apprehensions of mors
than eagle-eyed politicians, so it is to be hoped
they will not in future be seduced to change the
solid blessings of the government, for the positive
miseries of discord and sedition, because some
persons fay t they are averse to measures that have
never been tried.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT,!
December n, 1790. J
In obedience to the order of the House of Re-
PRESENTATivEsof the 9th Day of August last,
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury
to prepare and report, on this Day, such far
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be ne
ceflary for eftablifliing the PUBLIC CREDIT
âthe said Secretary further
Respectfully reports,
(concluded.)
The reason for the several provisions contained in the forego
ing plan, have been so far anticipated, and will for the mod
part be so readily suggested by the nature of those provifioris, that
any comments, which need further be made, will be both few
and concise.
The combination of a portion of the public debt in the forma
tion of the capital, is the principal thing, of which an explanation
is requisite. The chief object of this is, to enable the creation of
a capital fufficientlv large to be the basis of an extensive circula
tion, and an adequate security for it. As has been elsewhere re
marked, the original plan of the bank of North-America,contem
plated a capital of ten millions of dollars, which is certainly
not too broad a foundation for the extensive operations to which
a national bank is destined. But to collect such a sum in this coun
try in gold and fiber, into one depository, may, without hefita
be pronounced impra&icable. Hence the neceflity of an
auxiliary, which the public debt at once presents.
This part of the fund will be always ready to come in aid of
the fpccie : it will more and more command a ready sale ; and
can therefore expeditioufly be turned into coin if an exigency of
the bank should at any time require it. This quality of prompt
convertibility into coin, rendeisit an equivalent tor that neceflary
agent of bank circulation ; and aiftingniihes it from a fund in
land, of which the sale would generally be far less compendious,
and at great difadvantagc. The quarter yearly receipts of interest
will also be an actual addition to the specie fund during the in
tervals between them and the half yearly dividends of profits.
The objection to combining land with specie, resulting from their
not being generally in poffeflion of the fame persons, does not ap
ply to the debt, which will always be found in confiderablc quan
tity among the monied and trading people.
The debt composing part of the capital, besides its collateral ef
!eÂ£fc in enabling the bank to extend its operations, and confe
quentiy to enlarge its profits, will produce a direst annual reve
nue of fix per centum from the government, which will enter in
to the half-yearly dividends received by the Hock-holders.
When the present price of the public debt is considered, and
the effe& which its conversion into bank-stock, if corporated with
a specie fund, would in all probability have to accelerate its rife
to the proper point, it will eafilv be discovered, that the opera
tion presents in its outset a very confidetable advantage to those
who may become fubferibers; and from the influence which that
rife would have on the general inafs of the debt, a proportional
benefit to all the public creditors, and, in a sense, which has been
more than once adverted to, to the community at largr.
There is an important fact. which exemplifies the fitnefs of the
public debt, for a bank fund, and which may fervc to remove
doubts in some minds on this point. It is this, that the bank of
England in its firft ere&ion rested wholly on that foundation.
The fubferibers to a loan to government of one million two hun
dred thousand pounds sterling, were incorporated as a bank ; of
which the debt created by the loan and the interefl upon it, were
the sole fund. The subsequent augmentations of its capital,
which now amounts to between eleven and twelve millions of
pounds sterling, have been of the fame nature.
The confining of the right of the bank to contrast debts to the
amount of its capital, is an important which is not to
be found in the constitution of the bank of North- Ameiica, and
which while the fund consists wholly of coin, would be a restric
tion attended with inconveniences, but would be free fiorn any if
the composition of it should be such as is now proposed. The rc
ftrittion exists in the eftabliftiment of the bank of England, and
â¢s a source of security, is worthy of imitation. The consequence
of exceeding the limit there is, that each stockholder is liable for
the excess, in proportion to his interest in the bank. When it is
considered, that the dire&ors owe their appointments to the
choice of the stockholders, a responsibility of this kind on the
part of the latter, does not|appear unreasonable. But on the other
hand, it may be deemed a hardship upon those who may have
diflented from the choice. And there are many among us, whom
it might perhaps discourage from becoming concerned in the in
stitution. These reasons, have induced the placing of the respon
sibility upon the dire&ors, by whom the limit prescribed should
be tranfgrefled.
ThG interdiction of loans on account of the United States, or of
any particular State, beyond the moderate sum fpecified, or of
any foreign power, will serve as a barrier to cxccutive encroach
ments, and to combinations in3ufpicious to the fafety, or con
trary to the policy of the Uuion.
The limitation of the rate of interest is diÂ£lated by the consider
ation, that different rates prevail in different parts of the union ;
and as the operations of the bank may extend through the whole,
some rule seems to be necessary. There is room for a question,
whether the limitation ought not rather to be to five, than to fix
per cent, as proposed. It may with fafety be taken for granted,
that the former rate would yield an ample dividend ; perhaps as
much as the latter, by the extension which it would give to busi
ness. The natural effect of low interest is to encreafe trade and
industry ; because undertakings of every kind can be piofecuted
with greater advantage. This is a truth generally admitted ; jjut
it is requisite to have analized the i'ubjeft in all its relations, to be
able to form a just conception of the extent of that effeÂ£t. Such
an analysis cannot but fatisfy an intelligent mind, that the differ
ence of one per cent, in the rate at which money may be had, is
often capable of maAing an essential change for the better in the
(ituation of any country or place.
Every thing therefore which tends to lower the rate of interest,
is peculiarly worthy of the cares of legislators. And though laws
â which violently fink the legal rate of interest, greatly below the
market level, are not to be commended, because they are not cal
culated to answer their aim; yet whatever has a tendency to efFcft
a reduction, w iihout violence to the natural couife of things, ought
to be attended to and put sued. Banks are among the means moll
proper to accomplish this end; and the moderation of the rate at
which their discounts are made, is a material ingredient towards
it ; with which their own interest viewed on an enlarged and
permanent scale, does not appear to clalh.
But as the mo ft obvious ideas are apt to have greater force than
those which depend on complex and remote combinations, there
would be danger, that the persons whose funds must constitute the
flock of the bank, would be diffident of the fufficiency of the pro
fits to be expe&ed, if the rate of loans and discounts were to be
placed below the poirit to which they have been accuftomcd ; and
might, on this account, be indisposed to embarking in the plan.
There is, it is tiue, one reflection, which, in regard to men attive
ly engaged in trade, ought to be a security against this danger ; it
is thisâThat the accommodations which they might derive in the
way of theÂ«'r bufinels, at a low rate, would more than indemnify
them for any difference in the dividend ; fuppofiug even that some
diminution of it were to be the consequence. But upon the
whole, the hazard of contrary reasoning among the mass of mo
nied men, is a powerful argument against the experiment. The
institutions of the kind already existing, add to the dw.iculty of
making it. Mature reflection, and a large capital, may, of them
fslves, lead to the desired end. , ,
The laft'thing which requires any explanatory remark, is the
authority proposed to be given to the President to iublcribe to the
amount ot two millions of dollars on account of the public. Ihe
main defigu of this is to enlarge the specie fund ot the bank, and
to enable it to give a more early extension to its operations. Iho
it is proposed to borrow with one hand what is lent to the other ;
yet the difbut lement ot what is borrowed, will be piogrellive, and
bank-notes may be thrown into circulation, inflead of the gold
and filvcr. Bt fides, there is to be an annual reimbui femcnt of a
part of the sum borrowed, which will finally operate as an actual
i niveftment of so much specie. In addition to the inducements
[ to this measure, which results from the general interest of the go
vernment to enlarge the sphere ot the utility of the bank, there is
j this more particular consideration, to wit, that as far as the divi
dend on the flock iliall exceed the interest paid on the loan, there
is a politive profit.
The Secretary begs leave to conclude, with this general obser
vationâThat if the Bank of North-America (hall come forward
with any propositions, which have for objeÂ£l the ingrafting upon
that institution the chara&eriftics which shall appear to the legil
lature aeceirary to the due extent and falety of a national bank,
there are, in his judgment, weighty inducements to giving every
reasonable facility to the measure. Not only the pretensions of
that institution, from its original relation to the government of
the United States, and from theferviccs it has rendered, are such
as to claim a disposition favorable to it, if rhofe who are inteiefted
in it are willing, on their part, to place it on a footing fatisfa&ory
to the government, and equal to the purposes of a bank of the
United States; but its co-operation would materially accelcrate
j the accomplishment of the great object, and the collision, which
might otherwise arise, might, in a variety of ways, prove equally
disagreeable and injurious. The incorporation or union here
contemplated, may be effctted in different modes, under the au
spices of an ast of the United States, if it shall be desired by the
Bank of North-America, upon terms which shall appear expedient
to the governmenr
