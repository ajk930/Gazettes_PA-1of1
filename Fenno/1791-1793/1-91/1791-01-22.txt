FROM THE GENERAL ADVERTISER.
Mr. Bache,
I HAPPENED lately to be in the company of
several young ladies, where the following
curious convcrfation took place : â
Sophia. Mercy 011 our poor Congress ! I really
fear that some of them will return home crack
brained or 113'fteric. Our body politic is 10 very
fore, that it cannot bear to be handled, though
ever so gently ; every part crics, touch me not :
Don't pull my hair, Sirrah, hallos one : lon triad
on viy toes, squeals another : Tour confoundedelbow
kicks my flomach, roars a third : I'll fay you for
pulling a gentleman's nose, thunders the fourth.
If Congress attempts a duty on rum and whilky,
they are hiifed, as if they would tax the milk of
fucking babes. If Congress will teach our young
men to defend their mothers and fvveethearts,
they are called pick-pockets and cut-throats.
Charlotte. Indeed I sincerely pity our national
guardians. Their pupils are more whimfica!
than young girls, and fbme of them as froward
as naughty boys. The militia adl seems to dis
please every one. The great body of Quakers
dislike it: The trades-people want exemption for
their apprentices: The students expert: immu
nity : The young farmers will not bear the bur
den alone. I suppose that we young women
must learn militia duty, and turn out with both
mufquec and bayonet.
7'halejlr'ts. Upon my word, I long for this hap
py change of affairs. We fliall then expunge the
odious obey front the wedding ceremony. Should
I ever be unlucky enough to get a husband, sa
vage as an Indian, and ttrongasGoliath, I'll keep
him quiet as a nioufe, by slashing my gun in his
face. Then, my girls, we fliall fir ft be absolute
miftrefTes of otir houses, and then in a very short
lime govern the slate also. We ihall in this
western liemifphere set up a female empire,
that fliall laugh at all the male governments in
the world.
Roxana. My dear girl, let me kiss you for that
greatness of foul. Oh, may the glorious day
loon dawn, when our sex shall be delivered from
an ignominious slavery of 6000 years : a slavery
founded upon the story of our firil mother's eat
ing a forbidden apple: a slavery exercifecl by
pedants, sophists, blockheads, drones, drunkards,
fops, gamesters, bloods, bigots, rakes, voluptua
ries over the far more virtuous, fsnlible, lovely
part of the human species. In fifty quarto vo
lumes of ancient and modern history, you will
not find fifty illustrious female names; heroes,
flatel'men, divines, philosophers, artists, are all
of the niafculine gender. And pray what have
thev done during this long period of usurpation ?
Busy they have been with a witness : They have
written ten thousand unintelligible books : They
have laboured 1000 years to, eltablifh erroneous
fyltems, and worked hard again for another 1000
years to pull them down : They have been cut
ting each other's throats all over the globe, and
murdered at lead one hundred millions in quar
rels about idols, titles, gold lace, nutmeg and
rum : They have disputed for many centuries
about the best form of government, without pro
ducing one good patternâl boldly affirm, not
one, not even in this country; because the fede
ral conjlitution has the great defett of being too good,
lhat is, of supposing more virtue in the people
than they really have; of supposing them wife,
generous, brave, when they cannot fee their true
interest, when they love pelf, and hate martial
exercises
Thakftris. I am exceedingly pleased, my dear,
with your congenial sentiments, and hope that
we have 100,000 fillers 111 the United States. 1
anticipate the glorious day when American ladies
(hall be Commanders, Presidents of Congress,
Ambafladors, Governors, Secretaries of State,
Profeffors, Judges, Preachers; when the golden
age o( the Poets, and the milleniumof theClirif
tiar.s (hull be realized in America.
Amelia. Yet ladies, you mall in the execution
of this splendid plan, employ the men, at least
in subordinate parts.
Thale.flris. Yes, yes, we will make them hewers
of Wbod and drawers of water; they (hall cook
for us, make our (hoes, knit (lockings, wa(h our
linen, &c. &c. We (hall perhaps employ some
of them as pioneers and sutlers in our camps,
mere -quill-drivers in the petty offices, door
keepers, ineH'engers, sextons, and so forth.

Amtlia. But will they submit to this inferio
rity.
Roxana. Inferior minds will befitted for infe
rior ft at ions. We (hall keep the J word and the
purse in our own hands. We fliall moreover
keep them ignorant, and from infancy bend their
mind to ferviliry.
Amdia. But, after all, is not woman made for
man ? and would you be the wife of such a pu
lillanimous creature ? If not, how would you pre
serve this noble race of females, and the grand
empire you talk of.
Thaleflris. I confefs you puzzle me. However,
we in 11 ft pick out the least defective males, or
else import from Europe some of their bcft men,
cost what it will.
Amelia. This would still be a very partial sup
ply ; nine in ten of the women must die old
maids,
Roxana. It is so. We must make that use of
le men which nature intended. I hope also,
hat this neceflary evil will not spoil the offspring;
jecaufe the great Linnaeus has proved that we
derive the mental part from our mothers. Ad
mitting that the bodies of our children fhouldbe
the worse for the imbecility of their fathers, we
can harden them by cold baths, exercise, &c.
Maria. My dear friends, your schemes are
Utopian. The laws of Providence are immuta
ble : Man must do the rough work of society :
Woman shines in the tender cares and elegant
arts ef domestic life Let us carry a counter
petition to Congress, signed by ten thou/. 'and fair
Americans; let us boldly declare, that we will
never marry a man who cannot, in cafe of need,
protect us and our children.
The lady proceeded in Sketching this petition ;
it was arranged within an hour, and is now cir
culating over the country for subscription: I
fiiall shortly give you a copy of it.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
HOUSE OF LORDS.
November 26.
AT twenty minutes after two, his Majesty
came into thehoufe, and being seated upon
the throne, Sir Francis Molyneaux was directed
by the Lord Chancellor to proceed to the House
of Commons, and command their attendance up
on his Majesty.
FRIDAY,
Black Rod returned, with Mr. Addington, the
speaker, who approached the bar, between the
Master of the Rolls and Mr. Phillips, followed
by upwards of 200 members ; after bowing re
verentially to the throne, he addrefled his Ma
jelly as follows :
" .Mojl Gracious Sovereign,
IN obedience to your Majesty's commands,
your faithful Commons have proceeded, in con
formity to their antient privileges,to eletftaSpeak
er ; and theirchoice has fallen upon me, whom
they now present to your Majefiy for your royal
approbation.
The arduous situation in which I am placed,
will require abilities and judgmentinfinitely be
yond what your Majesty may expert from the
Speaker of your House of Commons. It is with
great reverence that I bend to your Majesty,
when I appear before you to receive your royal
approbation."
The Lord Chancellor approached the throne,
and having received his Majesty's commands, de
clared his Majesty's full approbation of the unan
imous choice his faithful Commons had made.
The Speaker tlien bowed to the throne, and
on behalf of the Commons, prayed his Majesty
to grant their ancient privileges, freedom o(
speech, &c. .
The Lord Chancellor again approached his
Majesty, and replied to the Speakerâ" His Ma
jesty has, in the most ample manner, confirmed
all your ancient rights and privileges.
His Majesty then made the following most gra
cious speech from the throne :
My Lords and Gentlemen,
IT is a great fatisfadtion to me to inform you,
that the differences which had arisen between
713
[Whole No. 181.]
me and the court of Spain, have happily been
brought to an amicable termination.
I have ordered copies of the declarations ex
changsd between my ambaflador and the niinifter
of the Catholic King, and of the convention
which has iiuee been concluded, to be laid be
fore you.
The objeifls which I have proposed to my
felf in the whole of this tranlaition have been,
to obtain a suitable reparation for the aifts of vi
olence committed at Nootka, and to remove the
grounds of similar disputes in future, as well as
ro secure to myfubjecfts the exercise of their na
vigation, commerce, and filhgries, in those parts
of the world which were the fubjedt of difcuffiom
The zeal and public spirit manifefted by all
ranks of my fubjerts, and the disposition and ,
condudl of my allies, had left r.ie no room to
doubt of the molt vigorous and eftedlual support i
but no event could have afforded me so much fa- .
tisfadlion, as the attainment of the objects which
I had in view, without any actual interruption
of the blefti rigs of peace.
Since the last session of Parliament, a founda
tion has been laid for a pacification between Au
stria and the Porte, and I am now employing my
mediation, in conjunction with my allies, for the
purpose of negotiating a definitive treaty be
tween those powers, and of endeavouring to put
an end to the diflention, in the Netherlands, in
whose situation I am neceflarily concerned, from
confederations of national interest, as well aa
from the engagement of treaties.
A separate peace has taken place between Ruf j
fia and Sweden ; but the war between the form
er of those powers and the Porte, still continues.
The principles on which I have hitherto
will make me always defireus of employing the
weight and influence of this country in contri
buting to the restoration of general tranquility-
Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
I have ordered the accounts of the expence of
the late armaments, and theeftimates for the en
fuingyear, to belaid before you.
Painful as it is to me, at all times, to fee any
increase of the public burthens, I am persuaded
you will agree with me in thinking, that the ex
tent of our preparations was dictated by a due
regard to the existing circumstances, and that
you will refledt with pleasure on so striking a
proof of the advantages derived from the liberal
supplies granted since the last peace, for the
naval service. I rely on your zeal and public
spirit to make due provision for defraying the
charges incurred by this armament, and for Aip
porting the several branches of the public service
on such a footing, as the general lituation of af
fairs may appear to require. You at the
fame time, I am persuaded, fliew your determi
nation invariably to persevere in that system
which has so effectually confirmed and maintained
the public credit of the nation.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
You will have obferred with concern the in
terruption which has taken place in the tran
quility of our India pofleffions, in consequences
of the unprovoked attack on an ally of the Britifli
nation. The refpecftable state, however, of the
forces under the dire<ftion of the government
there, and the confidence in the British name,
which the system prescribed by parliament, has
established among the nativepowers in India, af
ford the most favorable profpedt of bringing the
contest to a speedy and fuccefsful cor.clufion. ,
I think it necessary, particularly to call your
attention to the state of the Province of Quebec,
and to recommend it to you, to consider of such
regulations for its government, as the present
circumstances and condition of the Province may
appear to require.
I am fatisfied that I shall, on every occasion,
receive the fulled proofs of your zealous and af
fectionate attachment, which cannot but afford
me peculiar fatisfa<ftion, after so recent an op
portunity of colle<fling the immediate sense of 1
my people.
You may be aflured, that I desire nothing so
much on my part, as to cultivate an entire har
mony and confidence between me and my parlia
ment, for the purpose of preserving and trans
mitting to posterity, the invaluable blessings of
our free and excellent conllitution, and of con
curring with you in every nieafure which can
maintain the advantages of our present situation,
and promote and augment the prosperity ana
(happiness of my faithful fubje<3s.

five millions for Iron alone, which their own
mines were adequate to produce.
Letters from Vienna confirm the vi<ftory ob

Immediately after the convention has been ta
ken into consideration, the following important
objects will be submitted lo Parliament by the
minister, viz.
The forming of two diftincft governments for
Canada and Brunfwick, in North-America.

HAGUE, Nov. 23 â30
" We ar'e waiting with the greatest impatience
for news from Brabant, where we expert the
Austrian army are at this moment arrived. The
Belgic Congress, weary of the fanatical obstinacy
of Van der Noot, Van Enpen, and others of that
calV, have concluded, at last to make an attempt
to avoid an absolute fubmiflion to the Emperor,
and preserve their ancient constitution without
having recourse to military exertions. From all
appearances, the Belgic Congress have no other
relource left them but to accept the re-eltabli(h
ment of their old conllitnrion, with every gua
rantee for the ftricS observance thereof that can
reasonably be desiredâthe two superior orders
of the nation, fee the absolute neceflity of ac
cepting those terms immediately, and nothing
but the influence of the inferior clergy over the
dregs of the people, keeps alive the present dis
turbances, and prevent the low countries from
enjoying the bleflings of peace-"
" On the 13th inft. the Belgic Congress metto
debate upon the Emperor's manifeft. Van Eupen
and Van der Noot, conluded their harangues
with afolemn oath never to enter into any ac
commodation whatever with the emperor, or to
return under his sovereignty, and advised the
other members td follow their example ; but
this was peremptorily refufed ; and the delegates
from HainauJt, Flanders, Tournay and Tournefis
and from Malines, joined the other members in
their refufal, adding, " that they were ordered
by their conftitueiits to accommodate matters,
if poflible, witH their ancient sovereign.' And I
thus the Belgic nation is split into two parties,
the more moderate under the controul of the
moll numerous and violent, hurried on by a blind
impetuoficy and a few designing leaders.
(t Letters from Vienna, dated Nov. 13, men
tion a compleat vicftory gained by the Ruffians
over the Turks in the Cuban, on or about the
tenth of October. Notwithstanding the fuperio
ty of the Turks in numbers, they were totally
vanquished, and their whole camp with their
artillery, consisting of more than 300 pieces of
cannon, their baggage, provision, and even the
Serafkier and all his family, fell into the hands
of the conquerors."
STATE PAPER.
The following Minijlerial Paper,fignedby the Plenipotentiaries oj the
thjeeallied Powers, England, Puflia, and Holland, inanjzverto
the Belgic deputies, is too interejling, in the present juncture oj aj-
Jairs, to be omitted :
YOUR conflituents seem to doubt our having received posi
tive inflruttions, and fufHcient powers to allure to your nation, the
means which ought to precede the ceHdtion of hollilities, and that
we have not spoken minifteriallv in our verbal answers. To fct a
fide all such scruples and uncertainty, we here speak for the third
and last time, alluring you that we do it ministerially, in the name
of our refpe&ive sovereigns. " That it rests only with the Belgic
nation to fee their legitimate constitution re-established, such as it
existed, in the greatest purity, before the commencement of the
last reign, with all its privileges, civil and religious, and a per
fect oblivion of every thing, that has pafled during the late trou
bles. We are moreover au'horifed to add, that if your conflitu
ents enter again frankly and willingly into obedience to the Em
peror's government, his Imperial Majesty is disposed to grant such
farther conceflions as (hall elfentially alter the constitutions. But
we are obliged to declare openlv,that no longer a term than twen
ty one days, from the date of this letter, is allowed to accept their
propositions.
If you permit this time to pass, or it in the interval you give
occasion for any new holtile aggreflion, we protest, that our re
fpe&ive Sovereigns can no longer guarantee your fate.
Done at the Hague, the 31ft of Oft. 1790.

ExtraSl of letter from London, dated Nov. 24
By these inclosed papers you will fee that the
so much talked of revolution of the Belgic Pro
vinces lias come to nothing. Every effort has
been made to oppose the Emperor, but to no
purpose. The desertion of the Belgic army is
almott universal ; and the consternation occasion
ed by a convicftion of the utter impoflibility of
refitting troops so infinitely superior in discipline
and courage to their own, has obliged the people
to yield to irrefiftable necelfity. So it wouldhave
been with you in your contest with this country
had not the wide Atlantic and fovne other cir
cumstances interposed to save you.âAs to our
selves, we are congratulating each other on cer
tain imaginary advantages gained in our nego
ciation with Spain, such as the right of fifhing
for whales in the middle of the South Seas, and
eredling fortrefles in a barren country at the ex
tremities of the Globe, which even by our own
accounts is not worth pofiefling, except on ac
count of an article of commerce which must soon
be exhaufled.

In committee of the whole, on the bill repealing after

/lead. Mr. Boudinot in the chair.
MR. Williamson adverted to the publica
tion of the resolutions of the aflembly of
North-Carolina, in which business he said, some
mifinforniation had taken place. He then al
luded to the assumption, and observed that since
the United States had made the State debts the
debts of the union, it becomes necefl'ary to pro
vide for them, and he supposed some fort of ex
cise was neceifary. He reprobated aland taxâ
and then observed that excises according" to- the
constitution, ought to be equal ; he proposed to
equalize them by impohng a tax 011 beer and cy
der. If there will bean excess in the revenue,
as appears pretty evident, let the duty on our
own produce be struck out. He infilled on the
injustice of layingthis duty 011 those States, which
had been averse to the afl'umption.
He fuggefled other sources of revenueâmen
tioned newspapers, on which he supposed if a
duty was laid, it would be advantageous to the
public and to the printers. He concluded by
faying he hoped the i 3th feOtion would be ftrutfk
out.
Mr. Ames offered a few remarks, to shew the
obligation of the government to provide perma
nent funds for the payment of the interest ofthe
debt agreeable to the fpiritof the law pafled the
laltfeffionânor did he conceive that acafual sur
plus was any fufficient reason for not making
complete provision ; annual grants for the pur
pose of supporting the public credit had been fuf
ficiently proved inadequate to the objetfl.

AUCKLAND,
KEI.LER,
VAN DE SPIEHEL.
Mr. Elocdu crtli observed that if prejudices do
exist, whether well founded, or not, ihey pro
duce all the niifchiefs of a we(l founded oppofi"
tion till they are removed ; he said a universal
opposition to excifes,exifts in North-Carolina, and
he dreaded the consequences of this measure's
being urged ; North-Carolina has been well dis
posed to the government âwhat is the reason this
is not at prefentthe cafe ? It is owing fir, to the
ineaCures which have been pursued by the govern
ment. The r.Huinption was a m,eafure aniverfally
odious to the people of that State, and he believ
ed it was so to many other persons in the South
ern States. With refpeifl to the observations of
the gentleman from Mallachufetts, that North
Carolina knew when (lie adopted the Conl'citution
that the general government had a right ro lay
excises, he observed, that' North Carolina expect
ed that some attention would havn been paid to
her proposed amendments : On the whole he
hoped the clause would be struck outâand if an
excise is thought to be necefl'ary, let it be laid
only on foreign spirits, andfpirits manufactured
from foreign materials.
Mr. Lawrance replied to Mr. Bloodvvorth's ob
servations refpedtingconfining the duty to foi eigu
spirits : He said this would operate to produce a
very great deficiency in the revenueâThe impor
tation of foreign spirits will be destroyed, and
the revenue derived from that source will be loft.
He adverted to certain objections which had
been urged againltthe bill, from the experience
of Great Britainâhe (hewed, that none of these
applied on the present occasion : The bill is di
velted of those qualities, commonly supposed to
be connected â¢-it h Excise Laws. He took notice
of the accounts of uneafinelles which are said to
exist in some of the Statesâand counterbalanced
them by the tranquility and fatisfaction which
appear in others : In those which it is presumed
bear at leafl: a full proportion of the burdens al
ready imposed by government.
He contended, that the operation of the bill
would be to equalize the public burdensâand
when this is realized, as it will be, he doubted not
a fpiritof conciliation and good humor would be
the consequence.
Mr. Jackson said that the funding law had ap
propriated the revenue for the payment of all
the debts original and a (Turnedâand the faith of
the United States is pledged only to make up
such deficiency as may happen. It appears from
the calculations before the committee, that no
such deficiency will be to be provided for. He
wished gentlemen to shew some plausible reason
for this additional burthen on the peopleâThe
estimates he had offered cannot be invalidated.
Mr. Parker said he had heard nothing to in
duce him to change his mind refpet'ting this bill.
He had been uniformly opposed to excisesâand
he should not withdraw his oppo(ition at the pre
sent time.
He then adverted to tlie unequal operation of
an excise, especially on the foiithern States, \\ hich
he said rendered it entirely cantrary to the spirit
of the Constitution.
He doubted not the revenue would encrenfe,
not withllanding the supposititious defalcations
which had been mentioned. He urged the un
popularity of the tueafureâthe cultivation of
the foiithern orchards ought to be encouraged by
the northern states, as the foothern states had
encouraged their navigation and fifheries. But
if this partial duty is to be prefled upon us in
this manner, I fliall not think it my duty, said he,
to be equally zealous in their favour in future.
Mr. Livermore observed, that several estimate s
had been offered to the committeeâthey cannot
be all right because they disagree. He observed
that itliad not been noticed by any person that
the,prefent duty on foreign rum would be taken
away by this bill, and the whole funi to bevaifed
from that article is from the bill now under con
sideration. But suppose a surplusage of revenue
of i or 200,000 dollars should be in the Treasury,
which I wi(h with all my heart may be the cafe,
are there not ways enough to apply this surplus
age to the advantage of the United States ! He
instanced a variety of ways in which such.a ftir
plus might be applied ; but he did not seriously
contemplate such a surplus. He then adverted
to the objection on account of the inequality.â
He said the duty on spirits diftillec! from rnolaf
fes is agreed toâwhy should not the spirits dis
tilled from peaches in the southern States be also
fiibjedl to a duty : This he confideredas unequal
âand discovered a want of candor in the gentle
men from the southward.
Mr. Parker aiked the gentleman if molasses
was an article of the produce of this country?
the southern Hates have nothing by which they
can procure molafles : If the gentleman would
confentto excise fifh, he would content to an ex
cise on peach brandy.
Mr. Fitzfimons observed, that the deficiency
occasioned by the alteration in the duty on fo
reign ruin, would occasion a very considerable
addition to the deficiency of the revenue. With
refpedt to theinequality mentioned, he said there
was no probability that the southern states would
ever pay an over proportion of the revenue.Mr. Williamfon stated certain particulars to
shew, that a just idea of the l\i m paid by North-
Carolina could not be known by any lhitements
from the public officesâtheir business is carried
on coaflwifeâTo judge of their confumptioii,
recourse must be had to the exportations of that
StateâHe said the exportations of North-Caro
lina amounted to a million of dollars annually.
Mr. Clymer said that a gentleman from Geor
gia had mentioned the averiioii that the people
of Pennsylvania bore to an excise law. Such a
law he observed had been in force in the date
for upwards of 50 or 60 years, and that the ex
cise officers were veiled with as much power as
it was propol'ed to give them by the bill before
the house ; that some resistance had been offer
ed to those officers acting in the line of their du
ty ; but that those who opposed tliein in the ex
ecution of their business were severely fined.â
He was not convinced that the duty which it
was proposed to lay on ipirits by the bill under
confuleration was odious to a majority of the
states ; âthey mod of them had excise laws of
their own, and he conceived the present bill was
as well guarded as poflible, by wholfome provi
vifions against every objectionâFrom the state
ments which had been produced, there would be
no great excess in the revenue, he apprehended;
but if there was, it would be well applied in les
sening the public debts.
Mr. Madison remarked on the observations of
Mr. Kitziimons, refpeifting the southern States
not paying their proportion of the Import : He
shewed that the trade of the southern states was
carried on by the eastern and northern Statesâ
That theconfumption of the southern States was
proportioned to their numbers, and in this way
they bore their full proportion of the public bur
thens.
Mr. Jackson replied to Mr. Clymer, and said,

MR. FEN NO,
I CALLED this morning for the firft time, to hear the proceed
ings of the House of Representatives ot the Itate of Pennsyl
vania ; and was much surprised to find them warmly engaged in
a business that iu my humble opinion ; and I believe in the o
pinion of their constituents generally, they had no more to do
with than with the King ot Great-Britain's late fpcech to both
House* of Parliament.
The contention was about palling a sett of resolutions said to le
late to a law pending in the house of representatives of the United
States, refpefting revenue. Nopeifon will pretend to qucltion
the right of the house in exprefling their sentiments on the public
measures of the national legiHature ; but in the present cafe, I very
much question if there wasa neceflity for such caution, and much
more the propriety of the mode of cxcrcifing it.
We trufh it will never be disputed that the Aflembly of a free
State have a right to bear testimony against any law,that is " e!\ab
liftied upon principles, subversive ot the peace, liberty, and rights
of its citizens but did the 'gentlemen, who offered the refolu
t ons, make it appear that tnc proposed law was founded on luch
principles, or that it would have such a tendency ? I believe it
will be acknowledged, they did not, either in the debates or
otherwise, only by an indirect charge or insinuation, contained on
the face of the resolutions. If there was real caufc of complaint,
why not come forward and remonstrate boldly and openly ; and
if there was no cauf.-, why found an alarm, and take'up so much
time about a visionary evil that did notexift ?
If popularity was theobjeft the gentlemen had in view, the good
fenfeot the people of Pennsylvania will certainly difappoini them ;
for it is not to bo doubted, that they h3ve as well-founded a con
fidence in their representatives in the one body as in the other.
It is notorious that the members of that body, with regard t Â»
whose conduct and vjews too manv endeavoi to promote jcaloufy
and aiwruft, have at all times evinced the most sacred regard to the
rights and liberties of the people; and from their means of obtaining
information, are more likely to be able to judge on qutftions which
have for their objefct the general intcrefts of the nation.
Philadelphia, Jan. 20, 1791. A PENNSYL.VANIAN.
Philadelphia, Jan. 22.
The advocates of the present government, be
fore it was adopted by the people, were thought
to be very sanguine in their anticipation of the
blefli ngs which would result from its establish
ment. It has turned out on the trial, however,
that the event has exceeded the expeiflationâmore
is perhaps fulfilled than was promised : But many
who allow that our situation was deplorable be
fore the union was secured by the new govern
ment, and that it is at present more prosperous
than the mod sanguine could then have expeift-
715
Ed, yet will not give all the credit of the change
to the new Conititution. But a correfpondenc
thinks it ufeful to remark, that there is one point
in which all parties may agree, which is, that
whether the surprising prosperity of the country
is, or is not, in any degree, the work of the na
tional government, it is plain, that nothing can
secure the continuance of that prosperity but the
preservation of the government : Weakening the
government, or overthrowing it, would imme
diately change the condition ;;nd prof'pedts of the
people. While we enjoy lb much, and hope lb
much more than we enjoy, we lhould reverence
our government, and conlider any attempt to ex
cite the people to deftrny ir, as more injuriousto
our wealth, than the Heflian Fly in our wheat
fields. That infecft attacks but one grain, and
not every species of that : But anarchy and civil
discord spare nothing. The infetft takes the feed
âviolence would seize the crop. The adoption
of the Conflitution saved us from these evils : By
fupportingic we may hope in future to avoid them.
Before the Constitution was adopted, itw2s chargcd with tend-
ing to oppreflion and tyranny : A man who believed all that he
had heard against it, mull have expefled in 1791, to wear wooden
Ihoes, and to want spirit to fay his foul was his own. How
things are changed ! The government has been tried : And
what is fa id against it now ?âThat itdoes injustice ? No : But
that it docs more than justice exatts of it.âlt pays debts, which
fay the accusers, it did not owe ; but which are allowed to be ho
nestly dueâwhich on fettling the accounts, this government flood
bound to pay, and which the worthy creditors would have been
likely to lose, if it h:Â«d not consented to admit, without delay.â
So much for its tyranny, and treading on men's rights and proper--
ty. Now for its oppreflion : Why ; that its revenue is foam
pie, that new taxes are declared to be fuperfluous. Americans,
you have tried your government : You have tried to do without
one : âWhich do you like best ?
A correspondent obfeves, that agreeable to the {ketch of the
debates in the Pennsylvania house of Representatives, as publifhcd
in Mr. Dunlap's paperâthe cause of the union, io far as it de -
pends on revenue to support it, is in a very sickly condition.âA
torrent of oratorical declamation in favor of interfering'with the
legislature ot the United States, is countera&ed by a few detached
sentences ; and the " indujlry" of an individual tcderalift onlyâ
it even appears that when called upon to give their reasons, the
federalifts do " not offer any particular arguments."
It appears to be the general wish of the legislatures of the seve
ral states, thatthe debates of the Senate of the United States flvmid
be public.â North-Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New-
York have that fentimrnt.
Accordin? to some recent resolutions pafled in the lcgiflatures
of particulai fiatcsâwe appear to be in a fair way to get rid of
â¢he cxpence of supporting a federal government ; efpeciallv as
the work oflegiflation for the whole union appears to be bett.i un
derstood, by detached bodiw than by i!ie concentered wifcom of
the Ratesâeven in the opinion ol some who are sworn
the federal constitution,
We hear from, Albany that the contention of Vermont made a
houfc on the 6th inft. in order-to deliberate upon the adoption of
the Constitution of the United States. From the degree of unani
mity which appeared among the members, it is (fays the Albany
account)probable that they adopted the constitution on Saturday,
the Bth instant.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT,!
Deambir 13, 1790. J
In obedience to the order of the House of Re
presentatives of" the prb Day of August lad,
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury
to prepare and report, on this Day, luch fur
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be ne
ceflary for establishing the PUBLIC CREDIT
âthe said Secretary further
Respectfully reports,
(continued from our last.)
TO procure for the landholders the afliftance of loans, is the
great deftderatum. Suppofingother diiSculties lurmounted,
and a fund created, composed partly of coin and partly of land,
vet the benefit contemplated could only then be obtained, by the
bank's advancing them its notes for the whole, or part, of the va
lue of the lands they had subscribed to the flock. If this advance
"was small, the relief aimed at would not be given ; if it was
large, the quantity of notes iflued would be a cause of diftruji, and
if received at all, they would be likely to return speedily upon the
bank for payment ; which, after exhausting its coin, might be
under a neceflity of turning its lands into money, at any price that
could be obtained for them, tf> the irreparable prejudice of the
proprietors.
Confiderationsof public advantage fugged a further wifh,wh'ch
is, thar the bank could be established upon principles, that would
cause the profits of it to redound to the immediate benefit of the
State. This is contemplated by many, who speak of a national
bank, but the idea seems liable to insuperable obje&ions. To at
tach full confidenceto an institution of this nature, it appears to
be an eflential ingredient in its ftru&ure, that it shall be under a
private not a public dire&ion, under the guidance of individual in
tcrejl, not of public policy ; which would be supposed to be, and in
certain emergencies, under a feeble or too fauguine administra
tion, would really be, liable to being too much influenced by
public ncccfjity. The suspicion of this would probably be a canker,
that would continually corrode the vitals of the bank, and would
be molt likely to prove fatal in those situations, in which the
public good would require, that they should be moll found and
vigorous. It would indeed be little less than a miracle, (hould
the credit of the bank be at the disposal of the government if in a
longferiesof time, there was not experienced a calamitous abuse
of it. It is true, that it would be the real interefl of the govern
ment not to abuse it ; its genuine policy to husband and cherilh
it with the moll guarded circumfpeftion, as an inestimable trea
lure. But what government ever uniformly consulted its tiue in
terests, in opposition to the temptationsof momentary exigencies ?
What nation was ever bleffec? with a constant fuccellion of up
right and wife administrators ?
The keen, steady, and as it were magnetic sense of their own
interest as proprietors, in the dire&ors of a bank, pointing in
variably to its true pole, the prolperity of the institution, is the
only security that can always be relied upon for a careful and pru
dent administration. It is therefore the only basis on which an
enlightened, unqualified and permanent confidence can be expeft
cd to beere&ed and maintained.
The precedents of the banks eftabiifhed in several cities of Eu
rope, Amsterdam, Hamburgh and others, may seem to militate
against this position. Without a precise knowledge of all the pe
culiarities of their refpe&ive constitutions, it is difficult to pro
nounce how far this may be the cafe. That of Amsterdam how
ever, which we bell know is rather under a municipal than a go
vernmental direction. Particulai magillrates of the city, not of
ficers of the republic, have the management of it. It is also a
bank of deposit, not of loan, or circulation; consequently less
liable to abuse, as well as less ufeful. Its general business con-
fills in receiving money for fafe keeping, which if not called for
within a certain time, becomes a part of its flock, and irreclaim
able : But a credit is given for it on the books of the bank, which
being transferable, anfweis all the purposes of money.
The dire&ors being magistrates of the city, and the stockholders
in general its most influential citizens, it is evident, that the prin
ciple of private interest mud be prevalent in the management of
the bank. And it is equally evident, that from the nature of its
operations, that principle is less essential to if, than to an institu
tion constituted with a view to the accommodation of the public
and individuals, by direÂ£l loans and a paper circulation.
As far as may concern the aid of the bank, within the proper li
mits, a good government has nothing more to wifli for, than it
â¢will always poflefs ; though the management be in the hands of
private individuals. As the institution, if rightly constituted, mull
depend for its renovation from time to time on the pleasure of the
government, it will not be likely to feel a disposition to render it
felf by its condufl unworthy of public patronage. The govern
ment too, in the administration of its finances, has it in its power
to reciprocate benefits to the bank, of not less importance than
those which the bank affords to the government, and which be
sides are never unattended with an immediate and adequate com
pensation. Independent of these more particular confederations,
the natural weight and influence of a good government will al
ways go far towards procuring a compliance with its desires; and
as the directors will usually be compoied of some of the moll dis
creet, refpcÂ£lable and well-informed citizens, it can hardly ever
be difficult to make them sensible of the force of the inducements
â¢which ought to stimulate their exertions.
It will not follow from what has been said, that the state may
not be the holder of a part of the {lock of a bank, and confequerit
ly a sharer in the profits of it. It will only follow that it ought
not to desire any participation in the direction of it, aud therefore
ought not to own the whole or principal part of the flock ; for if
the mass of their property fliould belong to the public, and if the
direction of it should be in private hands, this would be to com
mit the interests of the state to persons not interested, or not
enough interested in their proper management.
There is one thing, however, which the government owes to it
felf and to the community ; at least to all that part of it, who are
not stockholders; which is to reserve to itfelf a right of ascertain
ing, as often as may be neceftary, the ftite of the bank, excluding
however all pretention to controul. This right forms an article in
the primitive constitution of the bank of North-America ; and its
propriety stands upon the eleareft reasons. If the paper of a bank
is to be permitted to insinuate itfelf into all the icvenues and re
ceipts of a country ; if it is even substituted for gold and fiJver in
all the tranfattions of business, it becomes in either view a nati
onal concern of the firft magnitude. As such, the ordinary rules
of prudence require, that the government should poflefs the means
of ascertaining, whenever it thinks fit, that so delicate a trust is ex
ecuted with fidelity and care. A right of this nature is not only
defirabJe as it refpeÂ£ls the government; but it ought to be equally
so to all thofc concerned in the institution; as an additional title
to public and private confidence; and as a thing which can only
be formidable to practices that imply mismanagement. The pre
emption mull always be, that the c.hara6lers who would be en
trusted with the exercise of this right on behalf of the govern
ment, will not be deficient in the discretion which it may require;
at least the admitting of this presumption cannot be deemed too
great a return of confidence tor that very 1 rge portion of it which
the government is required to place in the bank.
Abandoning therefore ideas, which however agreeable or desi
rable, are neither pra&icable nor fafe; the following plan for the
constitution of a National Bank, is refpeÂ£tfuiiy submitted to the
confidcration of the house.
[For this plan, fee No. 69 ef this Gazette.'}

vantage in tranfatting business here. Heis fully imprefied with
the truth of the adage that " difparch is the foul of business," and

Th'ef* prints are the firft of a series, in which it is proposed to
reprcfent the most important events of the American Revolution.

No period of the history of man, is more interesting than that
in which we have lived. The memory of scenes in which were
laid the foundations of that free government, which fecurcs our
national and individual happiness, must ever remain dear to us,
and to posterity ; and if national pride be in any cafe juftifiable,
Americans have a right to glory in having given to the world an
example, whose influence is rapidly fprcading the love of free
dom through other nations, and every where ameliorating the
condition of men.
To afliftin preserving the memory of the illuflrious events which
have marked this period of our country's glory, as well as of the
men who have been the most important a&ors in them, is the ob
je& of this undertaking History will do justice to an sera so im
portant ; but to be read, the language in which it is wrinen must
be understoodâthe language of painting is universal, and intelli
gible in all nations, and every age.
As several years of bis time, and a very considerable expencc,
are necelTary to accomplish this undertaking, it would bean im
prudent facrilice to the mere hope of reputation to go more deeply
into it, without a probability of ultimate success :âThat he may
judge of the degree of this probabilitv, Mr. Trumbull, by the ad
vice of his friends, proposes this fubfeription, and flatters himfelf
with a hope 0/ meeting that patronage from his countrymcn,
which will juftify his pursuing the object with ardor; and with
out which it is importable that so expensive a work fliould be con-
tinued
The fubje&s proposed to be reprefented,in addition to the two
foregoing, of Bunker's-Hill and Quebec areâ
* The Declaration of Independence,
* Battle at Trenton,
* Battle of Prince town,
Surrender of General Bur gov ne,
Treaty with France,
Battle of Eutaw Sprincs,
* Surrender of York-Town,
Treaty of Peace,
Evacuation of New-York,
Resignation of General Washington,
The Arch at Trenton,
Inauguration of the President of the United States.
Each pidture will contain portraits of the principal charaftrrs
who were present at the scene represented, Those marked with
liars, are coniiderably advanced ; and the prints from the whole
will be executed of the fame size, and by the most eminent cr.-
gravers.
