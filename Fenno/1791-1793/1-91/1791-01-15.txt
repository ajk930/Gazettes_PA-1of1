" Head-Quarters, For t-Washi ncton,
November 23, 1790.
ON Thursday, the 30th Sept. I took the field, with such of
the Federal Troops as were then aflembled at Fort-Wafli
ington, confiftingol two battalions,commanded by Majors Wyllvs
and Doughty, with three brass pieces of ordnance, viz. a fix pound
er, a ihiee pounder, and a five and one half inch howitz ; together
with Capt. Fergufon's company of artillery ; making in the whole
,3to men, including non-commiHioned officers. With this force
I immediately proceeded to join the militia under the command
of Col. Hardin, whom I had put in motion the 26th, and order
ed to advance along what is called, " Clarke's Old Trace," for
ab"iut 25 rrvles, there to halt till further orders. The militia had
been draughted from Kentucky and Pennsylvania, and both to
gether amounted to 1133 men. Many of the former were fubfti.
tutes, and by no means equal, either in spirit or appcarance, to the
generality of their countrymen. My whole force then was 1453
(including two troops of cavalry) but from this number we may
lafelv deduct 200 of the militia as good for nothing.
14 Oft. 14th, I detached Col. Hardin with 600 men, composed
of 5Â° troops, and mi litis, 100 of whom were mounted.
The object was, to reconnoitre the country, and feel, at their towns
the enemy's pulse, while thcarmv advanced.
" A dispatch auived on the 16th from Col. Hardin, informing
me that the savages, and the traders, (who are, perhaps, the word
savages ot the two) had evacuatrd their towns, with appearances
of precipitation, and burnt the principal village, caHed the Omee
town, togeth'ri with all the traders' houses.
" On Sunday the 17th entered on the ruins of the Omee town,
or French village, at part of it is called. Appearances confirmed
accounts I have received of the conftemation into which the lava
ges and their trading allies had been thrown by the approach of
the army. Many valuables of the traders were dellroyed in the
confulion, and vast quantities of corn and other grain jud vegeta
bles, were fecrcted in holes dug in the earth, and other
places. Col. Hardin rejoined the army.
" BeGdcs the town of Omee, there were several other villages
fttuate upoa the banks of three rivcrt. One ps them belonging
Saturday, January 15, 1791.
to the Omee Indians, railed was (landing, and con
tained 30 houses, on the bank oppofit ; the principal village. Two
others, confiding together of about houses, lay a few miles up
the St. Mary, and were inhabited by Delaware*. Thirty-fix
houses occupied by other savages of this tribe formed another, but
Icattercd town, on the east bank of th- St. Jofcph, 2 or 3 miles N.
from the French village. And about the fame distance c'owu the
Omee river, lay the Shawance town of Chillakothe, confiding of
58 houses; oppohte which, on thr >'her fide bank of the river,
were i6htbit t on inoff, 'do; â  savages of the fame nation.
All these I ordered to be burnt ftaythere, together with
great quantities of corn and vegetable- Â» hidden (as at the principal
village) in the earth and other" placc?, by the favagfes, who had
abandoned them. It is computed th.re were not less than 20,b00
buiheis of corn in the ear, which the army destroyed,
44 On the 18th two Indians were fulled and scalped by the ca
valry ; and another was killed at nignt. We loft a great number
of horses at this time, occaftoued by the negligence of the militia
guards, and their disobedience of orders.
On the 19th, Col. Hardin was e'etached with 180 men, taken
from the Pennsylvania and Kentuckey militia, and 3Â° federal
troops commanded by Lieut. Arrn&rqng. Part of the detachment
proceeded about 10 miles westerly of the main body of the army,
now polled at Chillakothc, (the Peni;fylvanians, who formed the
left column, having fallen foirie milei. in the rear) when a body of
Indians appeared, and advanced to the attack ; and tho the enemy'
did not, as it is believed, exceed a hundred and thirty, yet the
militia made no refinance, but fled, leaving the handful of feder
al troops to their fate ; seven only or whom escaped. The mili
tia loft but few men ; among these, 1:11, lamented by his acquain
tance, Capt. Scott of the militia, son to Gen. Scott of Kentucky.
I am not informed of thelofs fudainwd by the favarges; but I con
ceive it could not be great.
*â¢ Incensed at the difWaccful conduit of the militia, and deter-,
mined to prevent,it poftiblc, a repetition of it upon any future oc
casion, I reprehended it in my next orders with great fevdiity.
This measure, tho harsh, will have been necefiary. It
operated as a stimulus to wipe off the foul stain, which the repu
tation ot the militia had incurred.
" *he great obje& of the expedition being now completely ef
fected, that is, the deftruflion of the v)mee towns, and the provi-
Hons laid up for their fuMTftence ; cn the 21ft the army began
to return towards Fort Walhington I y the route they came.
" It was originally my intention, ,0 have returned by the way
of the Ouiattanon (commonly callet the Weeah) towns on the
Wabafli ; and break them up also. M jor Hamtramck, command
ing at Fort-Kno;:, (Vincennes) had -oeei* previously ordered to
make a movement towards them wit!: the troops under hiscom
rnand ; 300 militia from Kentucky w te ordered to reinforce him.
Ihe movement was intended as well or a diversion to prevent an
union rf. tlv jL> J-. * Â£ v j*. j purnoff of *Kefb\ricT a
junffcion with our whole force, in cafe I should have judged it ad
vil'eableto enter the country of the Ouiattons. Circumftanccs
however rendered it impracticable tor me to attempt it, at this
time, with any tolerable profpe6t of success. The horses of the
army were now, by various caufts, reduced to two thirds of their
original number, and the remainder so worn down w?th hard fer
yice, as to preclude the poflibility of reaping much farther benefit
Irom them. I have not yet received any communication from
Major Hamtramck, notwithstanding the long lapse of time fmce
he was ordered to march.
"On the 2ill O&ober, the army decamped from Chillakothe,
returning on the rout we had come about 8 miles. Here we re
mained till the morning of the 23d. Finding, in the mean time,
that the enemy studiously avoided coming to a general afition ; and
conceiving it improper to leave them in the quiet enjoyment of
their late success, I rcfolved to make an effort to bring on another
partial engagement. For this purpose I detached, on the 21ft,
late at night, Col. Hardin, and Major Wyllys, with 360 men, 60
ot whom were federal infantryâthe reft being militia,from Penn
sylvania and Kentucky. I had sometime before, mounted a com
pany of militia, and annexed it to the two troops of Kentucky
cavalry, giving the command ot the whole to Major Fontaine, a
brayeanddefervingofficer,at that time fcrving as my Aid-de-Camp.
1 his corps made a part of the present command.
I gave orders to find out and fight the enemy at all events,
and to be fparingof no means that might tend to lessen the num
ber of the savages.âKnowing of what importance the life of eve
ry warrior is held among them. The detachment reached the
confluence of the Omee and St. Mary, early next morning, and
filed oft in three columns. The left, under Col. Hardin and
Major Hall, eroded at Kegiiogue, and proceeded along the welt
bank or the S-t. Joseph. The centre, confiding of the federal
tioops, under Major Wyllys, having passed the Qmee at the
French village, moved up the eail bank of the S:. Joseph, at some
distance from the river, while Major M'Millan led the right co
lumn over some heights on Wyllys's right. The enemy now ap
peared in different quarters, and the columns were loon and i'e
yera 11 v engaged with various success. A body of the lavage* hav
ing appeared in Wyllys's front, and ch er idled the idea of an at
tackthere, suddenly gained the un cupied heights on the right,
and turned his flank. At this crisis fell Major Wyllys, an officer
who.e long and meritorious ferv:ces claim the grateful rcmcm
lance of his country. With the talents of a cultivated mind, he
united the beftvirtuesof the heart. The little party, unfupportcd,
and overpowered by numbers, now gave way, leaving c.) out of
60 dead upon the held. Free use was made of the bayonet,
which tne lavages experienced to their colt. Lieut. Frothincham.
Â°r rY l ff ,rncnt Â» Was k'Medin the a&ion. I have loft in him an
utetul omcer, and a worthy man. While this part of the buliaefs
was atting, the militia were not idle : they behaved with the
pint of veterans, and flew numbers of the enemy ; who met their

were in no instances behind them,and the (laughter was reciprocal
Jiotn the heft information the enemy loft in the course of
this affair, upwards ot ,oo of their prime warriors,âmcA who
appeared to lear no danger. Not a squaw or a child was fee,,
this day to swell the number ot the flam. The enemy's loss can.

wanting to moderate hisardour in the field, and unite, in the ac.
compliihed gentleman, thecharaaer ot a good soldier. He fell
covered with wounds, in singly charging with his sword about 40
of the enemy. Some other officer, of the militia were killed,
and some few wounded Our whole loss in killed, wounded and
miffing, amounted to ,80, including officers. Upwaids of ;o
01 the wounded were brought off.

Capt. Gaines is defervii.g of great praise, for his foldleily conduct
during the whole expedition, and particularly for the intrepidity

antagoiuit as trophies of the victory.
" I am under many obligations to all the field-officers, both of
the Kentuckey and Pennl'ylvania militia, who gave me uniform
proofs of the befl: disposition to second my endeavors durin" the
expedition. Col. Haidin, who commanded the Whole militTa iÂ»
in a particular manner entitled to my acknowledgments, as well
for his cool and determined conduit in aaion, as for his attention
and petfeveiance in the execution of orders. AÂ« to the officers of
the federal troops under my command, I mud, in ju'ftice to them,
observe, that their whole conduct was marked bv a ftriff attention
to discipline, a promptitude to obey orders, and alacrity in the
execution of ihem.
" Aftci the action of the 2<id, the detachment rejoined the ar

marches on the 3d of November. No interruption w+iaiever ViJ
offered by th* enemy on our return ; a convincing proof this of
their having received a blow whi<;h they felt. I flatter my felt
good corileque'nces will be the re tuft. We have riot, f ciilcelve,
loft much more than man for man with the savages. Our fofscan
be repaired : their's is irreparable.
" On my arrival at this fort, the pack-horses of the line did not
exceed one half of their original number. Many had been ihoc
and liolen on the expedition ; others we're loft id (he woods ; anti
others again, being worn out with fatigue, Were either killed or'
left behind. The advanced state of the season having deprived us'
in a great measure of forage, I ordered them, at times, to be tied,
up at night, and flour to be served out at the rate of three pound*
daily to every horfc; hence you will perceive an extraordinary
consumption arof; of that article.
I detained in confinement here the Shawanoe prifonerwe

He appeared to be thankful, and departed from the gam foil with

CONGRES
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
MONDAY, Jan. 10.
In committee of the "wholeâon the hill declaring what
officer, in cafe of vacancy of the offices of President,
and Vtce-Prefident, jhall aCI as President.
Mr. Boudinot in the chair.
THE firft clause of the bill being read, which
contains a blank Co be filled up with the of
ficer, who ihall acft as President.
Mr. Smith( S.C.)obferved, that by theconftitution
ihe vacancy is to be fi])ed with an officer of the
United States : This narrows the difcuflion, said
he, very much. But conceived there was a
previous question neceflary to be- determined,
and that was, whether the person appointed to
supply the vacancy should hold the oflice during
the time for which the President apd Vice-Prefi
dertt was elected ; or whether he was to hold the
office only till a new election could take place :
He thought that by tGe Coiiftitiition, anew elec
tion was not to take place till the term for which
the President and Vice-President had been elect
ed, wns expired.
He 1 lien descanted on the refpedive offices of
t'.ie Chief Justice, Secretary of State, and Secre
tary of the Treasuryâand by several particulars
ihevved, that the appointment would moll natur
ally devolve on the Secretary of State. He ac
cordingly moved that the blank be filled with
the words " The Secretary of State."
Mr, Livermore observed, that in considering
this question, lie thorglit no reference should
be had to the officers which had been mentioned
âfor as it was supposed that the cafe contempla
ted would not happen once in a 100 years, he con
ceived that theprefeijt characters, who now hold
the above offices, woald be entirely our of the
question. He had in view a different person,
and that was the President of the Senate, protein
j poreâand moved that the blank be filled with
tliis person.
Mr. White observed, that the Conflitution fays
the vacancy fliall be filled by an officer of the
United States. The President, pro tempore, of the
Senate, is not an of\~ wÂ«f the United States.â
Besides this will give one branch of the legisla
ture the power of eleifiinga President : Tliis he
conceived was contrary to the Constitutionâas
both branches haye right to an equal voice in
the appointment in this cafe. This will intro
duce the very evil intended to be guarded against.
Mr. Williamfon said the motion was dire<flly
repugnant to the Constitution. Why not chul'e
the Speaker of this rfoufe ?
Mr. Liverinore said, he was well aware of the
objections offered by the gentlemen : He could
have wished the Constitution had pointed out the
person. But he conceived that the Senate was
theonly body that could do this business. If eith
er of the officers mentioned, fliould be the per
son designated to supply the vacancy, it would
be in the power of the Vice-President, by virtue
ofthe power of removing officers, absolutely to
appoint a fuccefior, without consulting either
branch of the legislature.
Mr. Sherman observed, that this matter is left
with the legislatureâthe whole power of the
people, in cafe of the vacancy, devolves on the
legislature. The particular officer is not pointed
out : It lays with Congress to fay who it shall be.
The President of the Senate is an officer of the
United States. In cafe of the death of a Governor
and Lieutenant Governor, it is common in the se
veral States for the oldest counsellor to preside.
He inltanced the cafe of the abdication of James
lid. Adverting to the constitution, he shewed
that the appointment of Vice-President, in cer
tain cases devolves on the Senateâwho will of
courfc be President. The vacancy may be filled
for a longer or fborter time, and this appears to
be a question previous in its nature to be deter
mined.
Mr. Sedgwick said he fhouldbe in favor of the
motion of the gentleman from Nevv-Hampfhire,
if it was not for the express provision in tlie con
stitutionâwhich fays the office lliall be filled by
an officer of the United States. Should the va
cancy now happen, there would be no officer in
the Senate that could be appointed.
He mentioned that the office of Chief Justice
was considered as next to that of President, and
therefore, o|ii the whole, he considered him as the
mo ft proper person to fill the vacancy. He
thought the bill relpetfling the votes for President
and Vice President lhould be fn-ft determined
He moved therefore that the committee lhould
rife, and take up the next bill.
Mr. Carroll and Mr. Livermore objected to the
motion for the committee's riling.
Mr. Madison was also opposed to the motion :
He enlarged on the fnbjet r tâand said he thought
706
it a duty, nrged by a variety of confiderati 0 n s
important in themselves, and more so perhaps " '
their consequences, that the decision Ihould be
now riiade.
Mr. Smith started a variety of objections to Mr
Livermore's proportion : He thought it uncon
stitutional, asft would, in its operation, deprive
a state of a vote in the Senate.
Mr. Bourne said he seconded the motion for the
committee's riling, because he conceived there
was other business of more immediate importance
to be consideredâand he saw no necessity of com
ing to a decision on the present question at this
time.
Mr. Lawrance supposed the blank could be fill
ed up in the house : He was therefore in favor
of the coinmitree's rifintr.
The motion for the committee's rifin<* was ne
gatived.
Mr. Benfon was in favor of filling up the blank
with the Chief Justice. He observed that theob
jetf ion arising from the Vice Prafident's havina'
it in his power to name his fucdeflbryin cafe the
Secretary of State is interred, dtfes riot apply to
the Chief Justice. He is independent of the
Executive.
He pointed out several particularsâin which
there was an incompatibility in the offices of
Secretary of State, and that of President. He
obl'erved that the appointment to the regency
in all countries, is generally of the firft law officer.
Mr. Jackson objeifted to the Chief Justice, and
said, the Speaker of the House of Representatives
was, in his opinion, the next officer in point of
dignity, 10 the President and Vice President.
Mr. Madison objected to the Chief Justice, as
it would be blending the Judiciary and Executive.
He objected to the President, pro. tern, of tlie
Senate. I?e will be a Senator of some particular
State, liable to be instructed by the
will still hold his office : Thus he will hold two
offices at once. He adverted to the other ob
jections which had been offered against the Se
cretary of State, and fliewed the compatibility
of the two offices.
Mr. Stone stated sundry difficulties refpecfting
all the officers that had been named ; but on tl>e
whole, thought there were fewer against the Se
cretary of State than any other officer that had
been mentioned.
Mr. Seliey was opposed to coming to any deci
sion at the prefcnt time : He thought more impor
tant business was before the hotife : He was not
for making any decision that fliould give umbrage
to any officer in the government: The Secretary
of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, werei
equally entitled to the public notice. . : .s
Mr. Carroll was in favor of coining to a dÂ«ci
fionâand if nothing more could be offered against
the motion for filling up the blank with the Se
cretary of State, he presumed the committee were
ripe for a decisionâhe referred to the fituatioit
of countries who had not io season made piovi
fion for a regent, &c.
Mr. Sherman said he was in favor of the com
mittee's riling and reporting the bill, and leave
the blanks to be filled up in the house.
Mr. White was in favor of filling np the blank
in the committee: He saw no reason for a delay.
The officers mentioned are as well known now,
as they will be 3 clays hence. The Prelident and
Vice-President being in health, is a reason why
the fubjecl fliould now be considered : It can be
done with coolness, and freedom from all warmth.
Mr. I-awrance said, he thought there was 110
necessity for precipitating the decision : With
refpecft to every person that has been named,
difficulties have been started : The fubje<ft is im
portant- âand time should be given to deliberate
on the several afficers that have been named.â
He hoped therefore that the Committee would
rife, and report the billâand leave the blank to
be filled up at anothertime.
Mr Burke was in favor of the committee'*
riling': Heobferved, that tlie members in gener
al appeared to be very much undetermined:â
This is the firft day the fubjeA has been under
consideration : He hoped the members would
not be precipitated to vÂ«te on the occasion.
Mr. Carroll said, if tlie Committee lhould rife,
he hoped the bill would not be reported; but that
they would fetagain.
Mr. Burke laid he hoped the committee would
set again.
The question on the committee's rising and re
porting progress, was carried in the affirmative.

LONDON, Oct. 28
A motion lately made in the National AfTembly,
that the French flag ftiould display the national
colours, occasioned a warm debate ; in which
M. Mirabtau distinguished hinifelf, by his usual
eloqueuce and addressâso that the motion was
carried, notwithstanding the opposition, from the
aristocracy, was more open and bold than usual.
M. Mirabeati concluded his speech with adding
to the original motion, for displaying the nati
onal colours on the French flag, a further clause
directing that inltead of the usual shout of Vive
Is Roi, onboard the ships every'moriyng and even
ing, and on all important occasions, it lhall hence
forward be " VIVE LA NATION, LA LOI ET LE

ed, after a clamorous and disorderly debate.
The three colours of liberty having been or
dered to decorate the naval flag of France, a mo

The second resolve censures the treaty, as ma

* -â¢***-TREASURY DEPARTMENT,I
December 13, 1790. J
In obedience to the order of the House of Re
presentati vESof the 9th Day of August lait,
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury
to prepare and report, on this Day, such fur
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be lie
ceflkry for eltablilhing the PUBLIC CREDIT
âthe said Secretary further
Respectfully reports,
(continued from our last.)
The payment of the ifttercfV of the public debt, at thirteen
different places, is a weighty reason, peculiar to oar imme
diate fituaiion, for desiring a bank circulation. Without a pa
per, in general currency, equivalent to gold and silver, a consider
able proportion of the specie of the country must always be sus
pended from circulation, and left tc accumulate, preparatorily to
cach day of payment; and as often as one approaches, there must
in several cafcs be an actual transportation of the metals at both
expence and rifle, from their natural and proper reservoirs to dis
tant places. This nect'ffity will be felt very injuriously to the
trade of some of the Slates ; and will embarrass not a little the
operations of the treasury in those States. It will also obftruÂ£l
those negociations, between different parts of the union, by the
inftrumcntality of treasury bills, which have already afforded va
luable accommodations to trade in general.
Affummg it then as a contequence from what has been said,
that a national bank is a desirable institution, two enquiries em
ergeâls there no such institution, aJready in being, which has a
claim to that character, and which fupercedes the propriety or
neceflity of another ? If there be none, what are the principles
upon which one ought to beeftablifhed ?
There are at present three banks in the United States : That of
North-America, eftabhihed in the city of Philadelphia; that of
New-Yoik, eftablilhed in the city ot New-York ; that of Mafla
ehufetts, established in the town of Boston. Of these three, the
firft is the only one which has at any time had a direst relation to
the government of the United States.
The bank of North America originated in a resolution of Con
gress of the 26th of May, 1781, founded upon a proposition of the
fuperintendant of finance, which was afterwards carried into ex
ecution by an ordinance of the 31ft of December following, en
titled, u An oidinance to incorporate the fubferibers to the bank
of North-America."
The aid afforded to the United States by this institution, during
the remaining period of the war, was of cffential
and its conduct towards them since the peaee, has not wrakened'
its title to their patronage and favour. So far its pretensions to
the charatter in question are refpe&able ; but there are circum
flances which militate against them ; and confederations which in
dicate the propriety of an establishment on different principles.
The dire&ors of this bank, on behalf of theii*conftituents, have
fincc accepted and aded under a new charter from the State of
Pennfylvauia, materially variant from their original one; and
"which so narrows the foundation of the institution, as to render it
an incompetent basis for the extensive purpofesofa national bank.
The limit assigned by the ordinance ofCongrefs to the stock of
the bank, is ten millions of dollars. The last charter of Penn
lylvania confincs it to two millions. Questions naturally arise,
â whether there be not a dirett repugnancy between two charters so
differently circumstanced ; and whether the acceptance of the one
is not to be deemed a virtual surrender of the other. But per
haps it is neither advifeabie nor necessary to attempt a solution of
them.
There is nothing in the aÂ£l* of Congress, which imply an ex
clusive right in the institution to which they relate, except during
the term of the war. There is therefore no:hing, if the public
good require it, which prevents the eftabliftiment of another. It
may however be incidentally remarked, that in thegeneralopinion
of the citizens of the United States, the bank of North-America
has taken the station of a bank of Pennsylvania only. This is a
flrong argument for a new institution, or for a renovation of the
old, toreftore it to the fuuation in which it originally flood, in
the view of the United States.
But tho' the ordinance of Congress contains no grant of exclu
sive privileges, there may be room to alledge, that the government
of the United States ought not, in point of candour and equity, to
cftablifh any rival or interfering institution, in prejudice of the
one already established ; especially as this has, from services ren
dered, well-foundbd claims to protection and regard.
The justice of such an observation ought within proper bounds
to be admitted. A new of the fort ought not to be
made, without cogent and sincere reasons of public good. And
in the manner of doing it, every facility ftiould be given to a con
solidation of the old with the new, upon terms not injurious to
the parties concerned. But there is no ground to maintain, that
in a cafe in which the- government has made no condition re
ilri&ing its authority, it ought voluntarily to reftrift it, through
regard to the interests of a particular institution, when thoft* of the
Sutc di&ate a different course; especially too after such circum
ilances have intervened, as chara&erue the adlual fuuation ot the
bank of North-America.
ThÂ£ inducements to a new disposition of the thing arc now to
be corifidered. The firft of them which occurs is, the, at least
ambiguous, situation in which the bank of North-America has
placed itfclf, by the acceptance of its lalV charter. If this has ren
dered it the mere bank of a particular slate, liable to diflblution
at the expiration of fourteen years, to which term the ast of that
slate has reftri&ed its duration, it would be neither siÂ». nor expe
dient to accept it as an equivalent for a bank of the United States.
The reflri&ion of its capital alfd, which, according to the fame
iuppofnion, cannot be extended beyond two millions of dollars,
is a conclusive reason for a different eftabliftiment. So small a ca
pital promises neither the requisite aid to government, nor the re
quisite fccurity to the community. It may answer ver" well the
purposes of local accommodation, but is an inadequate foundation
for a circulation co-exteiifive with the United States; embracing
the whole of their revenues', and affetting every individual into
whose hands the paper may come.
And inadequate as fiich a capital would be to the eflential ends
of a national bank, it is liable to bÂ£ rendered still more so, by that
principle of the constitution of the bank of Nonh-Ameriea, con
tained equally in its old and in its new chatter, which leaves the
mcrcafe of the afilual capital at any time (now far short of the al
lowed extent) to the discretion of the directors or stockholders.
Jt is naturally to be expe&ed, that the allurements of an advanced
price or stock, and of large may difinclme those who
are intcrefted, to an cxtenfion of capital; from which they will be
apt to fear a diminution of profits. And from this circumstance,
the interest: and accommodation of the public (as well individu
ally as collettively) are made more subordinate to the interest,
real or imagined, of the stock holders, than they ought to be'. It
is true, that unless the tatter be confuhed, there can be no bank
(in the sense at lead in which institutions of this kind, worthy of
confidence, can be established in this country.) But it does not
follow, that this is alone to be confultcd, or that it even ought to
be paramount. Public utility is more truly the object of public
banks, than private profit. And it is the business of government,
to con&itute them on such principles, that while the latter will re
sult, in a fufficient degree, to afford competent motives to engage
in them, the former be not made subservient to it. To efFect this,
a principle object of attention ought to be to give free fcopc to
the creation of an ample capital ; and with this view, fixing the
Wounds, which are deemed lafe and convenient, to leave no diC
crction either to flop fliort of them or to overpass them. The
want of this precaution, in the establishment of the bank of North-
America, is a further aud an important reason for desiring one
differently constituted.
There may be room at firft fight for a supposition, that as the
profit* of a bank will bear a proportion to the extent of its ope
rations, and as, for this reason, the interell of the stockholders will
'not be difadvantageoufly affc&ed by any ncceffary augmentations
of capital, there is no cause to apprehend that they will be indis
posed to such augmentations. But molt men in matters of this
nature, prefer the certainties they enjoy, to probabilities depend
ing on untried experiments ;.efpecially when tbcfc promise rather,
that they will not be injured, than that they will be benefited.
From theinfluence of this principle, and a desire of enhancing
its profits, the dife&ors of a bank will be more apt to overstrain
its faculties, in an attempt to face the additional demands, which
the course of bufincft may create, than to set on foot new fubferip
t ions, which may hazard a diminution of the profits, and even a
temporary reduÂ£tiunof the price 6f flock.
