7'hi following remarks are (fubftatitialb ) copied from
the New-York Daily Advertiser.
IT is a very honorable proof of the patriotism
of the public creditors, that they discover so vo
luntary and general an acquiescence in the fund
ing system palled the la!t feiiion of Congress.
After the national legislature had so fully dif
cufled the fubjecft, and viewed all the circum
stances attending the public debt; it Ihould be
presumed, that their final determinations are,
upon the whole, best calculated to establish pub
lic credit, and protect the interests of public cre
oitors. Under this persuasion, and with an ar
dent desire to give effect to the operations of the
new government, the enlighted citizens of the
United States have generally demonstrated a
most lively approbation of the funding system,
as it now stands ; and it cannot be expected, that
Congress will depart from the principles upon
which the funding system has been modified :
For, whatever conclusions may be drawn from
rigid definitions of public faith, they now cease
to be llridtly applicable to our lituati'on. !t can
not fail to occur to every observing man, that
immense transfers of the public debt have taken
place since the funding system was established.
Those transfers have been regulated by the idea,
that the system was liable to no alterationâtha
jt was the result of a comprehensive \iew of th(
cafe, and would be as immutable by the legifla
ture, as the constitution itfelf. The question,
therefore, has assumed a different afpetft. Wha
would have been right the lall feflion, would be
wrong now. The bare difcuflion of the point ii.
Congress, whether the system should undergo an
alteration, would excite a suspicion with refpetft
to the final eftablifliment of public credit. The
great bulk of the creditors are contented, and
manifeft tjiie highest confidence that what is pro
mifed will be performed.
It is a favorable presage of the {lability and
vifdom of Congress, that the Senate of the United
States have pafled their laterefoluiion, with onl)
one diflenting voice.
Public creditors ! if ye be wife, be quiet where
ye are. ' CONSISTENCY.

Lately a ball at Windham, in Connecticut, was
graced with the presence of about thirty younp
ladies, each of whom was drefled in a handfoine
muslin gown, wrought by their own hands. A
patriotic example worthy the imitation of every
lady among ui, who wiflies well to her country,
as, on the advancement of the manufactures of
America, depends her trued interest.

ALBANY, Dec. 20.
By a gentleman lad evening from Quebec, we
are informed of the arrival at that place, of the
Hon. Gen. Alured Clarke (late Lt. Governor of
the island of Jamaica) who is appointed to fnc
ceed Lord Dorchester in the government : His
lordihip, however continues in it till springâThe
above gentleman farther informs that news of
the expedition against the Indians (mentioned
in the President's speech) under Gen. Harinar,
had reached Canada, and caused various conjec
tures, and various opinions were in circulation
respecting its real destination, some supposed it
was againlt Detroit, some one place and some
another.
NEWBURYPORT, Dec. Ij,
In this town, according to the late enumerati

was 4113 and the dwelling-houses 430. The
whole town nieafures but 620 acres, about 400 of
which are taken up for pastures, streets, &c. Its
greatest length is one mile and a half, and about
half a mile in breadth.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Stitch of the Debates cn the MILITIA BILL
FRIDAY, Dec. 24.
r "T , HE amendments of thecomr.iitreeof thewhole
A to the miliria bill, were further difcufl'ed
this day by the house. The debate was conti
nued on Mr. Madison's proposition in favor of
:ierfons conscientiously scrupulous of bearing
a' nis. A majority of the speakers appeared to
be :n favor of their exemption's being left to the
leveral Hates : In support of this idea,
Mr. Bourn observed, that if the general go
vernment should take up the matter, and fubje<fl
he Quakers to a penalty as an equivalent for
-erforial feryice, their situation would be ren
dered less eligible than it is at prefentâfor, in
( -veral of the Stares, he observed they are not
only exempted from militia duty, but from all

fines and penalties in lieu thereof; he inft need
o h u e J Sta ' eS , of New-Hampfcire, Maflachulett.,
Knode-illand and Connecticut.
Another memorial from the society of Quakers
on the Eastern fhnre of Maryland, againlt the 16th
section of the bill, was presented by Mr. Smith
member from that State, and read.
A motion of Mr. Clymer, to amend the motion
of Mr. Madilbn, after some difculfion, was nega
tivedâand the original motion being also put
was disagreed to ; so that, as the bill now stands,
the exemption of persons religiously scrupulous
of bearing arms, is to be provided for by the re
fpetftive states.
Mr. Smith, (S.C.) then renewed his proposi
tion refpedting independent companiesâwhich
he informed the lioufe he had so modified, as to
avoid the objections before offered to it. It is
to the following effect : â
Whereas certain independent corps of artil
lery, infantry and dragoons, now exilt in thefe
y.eral Uratesâlt is hereby enacted, rhat nothing
in this aift shall be confirmed to the dilbanding or
incorporating said companies in the militia ; t hey
at the fame time being liable to the performance
of the military duties herein required.
It being underllood that the biil ffiould be re
committed to a' felecft committee, it was voted
that this proportion be referred, with the bill.
On morion of Mr. Livermore, the 9th fecition
of the bill was expunged ; a motion by the fame
gentleman to strike out the 10th and uthfec
tions was negatived.
It was then moved that the bill be recom
mitted ; which being put, palled in the affirma
tiveâand Meflis. Wadfworth, Giles and Tucker
were appointed the committee.
MONDAY, Dec. 27.
In committee of the whole, on the (late of the
Union. Mr. Livermore in the chair.
The report of ihe Secretary of the Treasury on
the eftablifliment of land-offices, for the sale of
the lands belonging to the United States, under
conlideration.
Mr. Boudinot offered the following resolve :
" That it is the sense of the committee, that a
land-office be established at the feat of the gener
al government, under the direclion of 'com
millioners.
Mr. Scot wished the house to take a general
view of the business, before they went into the
particulars of the secretary's report, Upon the
whole lie was pleafecl with the plan drawn up by
that officer ; one part however he objected to.
That part of the report which provided for the
didribution of the land He did not approve
offetling apart trac r ts for particular descriptions
of purchafcrs. As an amendment he offered se
ven propositions, which hewilhed for the prtefenc
to lie on the table,, and which he proposed to of
fer as f'ubliitutes to different parts of the Secre
tary's report, a* they came before the house. His
principal object was to let the tracts which Con
grels proposed to fell, be indifcriininately located.
Mr. Boudinot thought the committee could not
then enter into the minutiae of the business. It:
was enough to fix the general piinciples, viz.
Whether there shall be a general land-office, and
two subordinateâWhether they rhaJl be under
the direction of commilfionersâand whether cer
tain tra<fls of land should bereferved by Congrels
for certain purposesâand then to appoint a com
mittee to bring in a bill on those principles, arid
ro take into consideration the minutiae of the bu
siness. Great changes, he observed, had taken
place since the report was drawn up. The com
mittee, he said, might consider what should be
the greatest quantity fixed as a limit to the sales
made by the general office, and what for the su
bordinate.
Mr. Sherman offered a resolution, that there
be a general land-office eftabliflied.âAgreed.
Mr. Boudinot. That there be two subordinate
offices, one in the government to the North-Weft
âthe other South of the Ohio.âAgreed.
Mr. Boudinot moved, that all sales made at the
general land-office fliall be above acres: Then
all below that quantity would be made at the su
bordinate offices. It should also be determined
whether Congress would fix the quantity, or
leave it to the commissioners. It appeared to him
a matter of importance.
Mr. Scott moved that the blank be filled with
one thousand.
Mr. White moved five thiufani.Mr. Boudinot thought the number too large.
Feifons, he observed, who wished to purchase so
large a tract, could afford, and would have 110 ob
jection toconie tothe feat of government to make
the purchase.
Mr. Sedgwick observed that it would be a great
advantage to have the contract for large purcha
ses made under the immediate eye of govern
ment. 'he house, however, he thought was not
prepared to fill up the blank ; lie wished it left
open.
I he motions for filling the blanks were with
drawn.
Mr. Boudhiot proposed that all smaller quail
tities be fold at the subordinate offices âTo pre
vent the confufion thdt felling the fame quantity
at the different offices might occasion.âAgreed.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) wished it determined under
whose direction these offices should be ; whether
of one or three conuniifioners, or of any officer
already appointed. He thought one officer would
be moil eligible ; there would be more refpon
libility, and uniformity.
Mr. Sherman wished the determination of this
particular delayed. His mind was notmadeup.
âThe motion was delayed.
Mr. Boudinot proposed that no lands should be
fold previous to fettling the indian claimsâ
Agreed.
That part of the report was read, which sets
apart certain lots, for certain particular purpo
ses anddiredts the manner oflocating them,
Mr. Scott moved as a fublHtutc his second pro
position, that such districts as (hall be set apart
for sale shall include the actual settlements, and
be left to be indiscriminately located. He said
it was improper to set aside different tracfts for
different modes of location, some in large trades,
others in small lots ; he conceived it would be the
interest of government to let every one purchase
where he pleased and as much or as little as he
chose. From experience he knew that those parts
were always fettled with the moll celerity that
were not bound down to any of those reftriftions
I or his part he could fee no good argument in fa
vour of them ; he wished some of the gentlemen
â who approved of this mode, to give him some
reasons for preferring it. There could be no
fear, he observed, of individual settlers flattering
and losing themselves in the back woods ; there
was a fufficient check to prevent itâthe Indians
would keep them cornpadt, much more effectual
ly than any regulation Congress could make. If
certain scattered tracfts to individu
al settlers, a confutable tracfc including these
was wanted, he could fee no inconvenience in
granting it, reserving to the former settlers their
rights.
Mr. Williamfon rose to give the gentleman lafi:
up one reason for opposing indiscriminate locati
on. Hitherto he owned much mifchief had i.o'
anfen from this mode of settlement ; but now
there were persons rich in lecurities and ca/li
ready to take up conttderable quantities ofland
which if they were permitted to feleft here and
there, pick and chufe every choice tract they
could, ifindifcriminate location was the establish
ed principle, take upall the good lands, and leave
for future settlers, those who might not have the
fame means of purchasing immediately at com
niand, the indifferent parcels. Many he knew
had it in contemplation te do this if the opportu
nity offered. He instanced North-Carolina as an
example of the injurious tendency of this liber
ty ; whe.re many tratfs are unsaleable, ovvino- to"
this circnmrtance. If these tradts were to be pur
chafed by ac'tual settlers, the cafe would be dif
ferent ; but they would only be taken up by per
foils under the name of actual settlers. Such a
practice would be an impediment to such compa
nies of Europeans as might wish to fettle amon r
Mr. Scott raid he expedted the gentleman would
have offered more solid objections to his plan
and more forcible arguments in favor of the other'
Though the firft settlers had the the
land ; yet he conceived the remaining part would
acquire a considerable additional value from the
furroundmg settlements. As f or the European
companies who might be tempted to fettle amonp
us, he did not contemplate it as an object so de
ferable. A body of French people fettling in
that way would, hefaid, preserve their
and manners 2000 years perhaps ; this woufd not
be for the true interest of the country all its i n
habitants ftould by mutual intercourse become
affimulated and no name be known but that of
Americans. .Â«mi ox
Mr. Boudinot was against indiscriminate loca
tion . He Taid, he had seen the bad effetfts ofJr
in the State from which he came. Persons had
bough, up the lowlands, and râ,d
to Inch as absolutely needed a water lot to E
farm at enormous prices. He mentioned another
objection to the plan-the tendency it had to
create law-fmts. He said he was certain moll
money had been (pent at law in disputes arifin!
from that mode of settlement in New-Terfev
S . W0 " ld h * v ? b f. en neceflary to purehife the
Jand in the whole state. The late Congress, he
informed, had adopted a method to obviate
the inconveniences of the former modeâthe lands
were laid our into mile-squares, these divided in
to four equal squares, and in that form fold.
Mr. White proposed that such as fliall not im
prove their purchases within a fixed reasonable
time, fbould forfeit the fame.
Mr. Boudinot wished it left to a committee to
determine. He had no objection to leave the
power with the commissioners.
Mr. Scott approved of the idea thrown out by
Mr. White, and agreed to amend the proposition
in conformity with the opinions of Mefli s Boudi
not and White.
Mr. Boudinot conceived it would be very diffi
cult to determine what an actual settler was. A
pui chafer could go and spend a few days oil his
land, and call himfelf an acftual settler.
Mi. White proposed that a man holding only
a certain proportion of uncultivated land to the
improved, ihould be called an actual settler.
Mr. Sedgwick disliked indiscriminate location,
He was confident if the diftricfis so to be fettled
were extensive, there would be too great room
for speculation aud monopoly.
Mr. Scott said there were traces of land which it
is lmpoflible to fell even by offering good parcels
with them. Between Philadelphia and his home
there were, he said, fpors, that were only intend
ed by nature for the birds and beastsâthat could
be of no value for cultivation. He could not fee,
he faid,much probability, that the belt land would
be picked outâthe difficulty of exploring a wild
and uncultivated defart, opposed a conhderable
banier to such attempts.
Mr. Scott's amendment was loft.
Mr. Fitzfimons moved to flrike out from
the clause the limitation of 100 acres to each
settler.
Mr. Scott disliked the limitation, he wished it
amended so as to leave it to Congress to fix the li
mitation by adâAgreed.
âI? the " ext Paragraph in the following words.
The other tracts flial! from time to time be set

except where they shall adjoin upon a boundary
of Tome prior grant, or of a trad so set apart; in
which cases there/hall be no greater departure
fiom such form oflocatton, than may be absolute
ly necessary."
Mr. Scott moved an amendment that the seven
â  anges which in laying off Congress had already

by that article <""*Â« P'to b.fa apart

that they mcluded 35 ] ot s, each 6 milesTquare

amendmentâ without debate.
Then the following was read : " That- 1-JlO

tnan He fubmuted the idea to the con

Mr Sedgwick then moved to amend the clanfe

oc lei* man 30 cents pr. acre.

Mr. Stone objected to the motion. Hefaid the
operation of it would be, to leave it discretion
ary with the surveyors to fix the price of the v a .
rious tradls : This would be to constitute a tribu
bunal, in a measure independent of the govern
nient. He thought the policy of the govern
ment mould be, to fix on a price, which fhafl be
so reasonable, that persons m ay feel every induce
ment to pay it before they take up the lands for
it has been found by experience, laid he, that
oncea tra*ftof distant country is taken pofc
feflion of, you never can get any thing more than
the settlers are willing to pay. He infilled that
it was impracticable to fix the relative value of
unlocated landsâit had been repeatedly tried
without effect. He asked if any of the States had
ever established various rates for their lands ? He
knew of none.
Mr. Sedgwick answered the enquiry refpe<tinÂ£
the relative value of lands being ascertained in
the several states : He said that so far as his in
formation extended, which refpe<fted only the
states of New-York, New Hampshire, and MalTa
cliufetts, this had invariably been the cafe: Every
man knows there is a moil eflential difference
in the value of lands : Those on navigable rivers
may be ten times as valuable as those on the top
of a mountainâthis every individual is so sensi
ble of, that a difference in the price is constantly
m and government (heuld not make
a difference, it is impoflible to fay; any man, by
caitinghis eye on a map, can at once determine
that fonie part of the land is unspeakably more
valuable than other parts. He was certain that
veiling a discretionary power, in the disposal of
the land would be productive of the grearefl ad
vantage to the United States ; and on this prin
ciple he could not conceive why the furveyorg
ihould not determine the relative quality, that
the United States may fland some chance of get
ting the value of this property.
Mr. Livermore was in favor of Mr. Sedgwick's
motionâand enlarged on the unreasonableness
or fixing a particular price.
Mr. Jackson was opposed to inverting a discre
tionary power to determine the price with any
persons whatsoever ; _it had been productive of
mUchievous consequences in the state ofGeorgia.
âHe was for fixing a price, and the highefl price
r u Â° L lan(is would bearâ when that is
old, if the residue will not bear the price efta
bliihed, xt can thenbe reduced.
? cott objected to the motionâhe stated se
veral difficulties jthe principle was, that foreign
ers will be deterred from adventuring ; owing
to the uncertainty in the price : For when they
arrive in the country to fettle,they most purchase,
and they will then lie at the mercy offpeculators.
(To be continued.)

they have seen with great pleafurethe
I i operation of a National Government which

They rejoice to find amongst the powers which
belong to this government, that of restraining by
certain duties, the consumption of distilled spi

It belongs more particularly to men of other
P ir i-Â°" St 0 enumerate the pernicious effects of
tliele liquors upon morals and manners. Your
memorialists will only remark that a great pro
portion of the moftobftinate, painful, and mortal
disorders which affe<sl the human body, are pro
duced by distilled spiritsâThat they are not on
ly destructive to health and life, but that they
impair the faculties of the mind, and thereby
ten equally to dilhonor our character as a nati

Your memorialists have no doubt that the rumor
of a plague or any other pestilential disorder,
which might sweep away thousands of their fel

and effectual meafuresinourgovernment, to pre
vent or subdue it.
Your memorialists can fee no just cause why
the more certain and extensive ravages of diftl
led spirits, upon human life, should not beguard
ed against with corresponding vigilance and ex
ertions, by the rulers of the United States.
Your memorialists beg leave to add further
thatthe habitual use ofdiftilled spirits in any cafe
whatever, is wholly unnecelTaryâthat they nei
ther fortify the body againfl the morbid effedts
of heat er cold, nor render labor more easy, nor
more producfliveâ and that there are many arti
cles of diet and drink which are not only fafe
and perfectly salutary, butpreferable todiitilled
Ipirits for the above mentioned purposes.
Your memorialists have beheld with regert,the
feeble influence of reason and religion, in re
straining the evils which they have enumerated.
They center their hopes,) therefore, of an effici
ent remedy for them in the wisdom and power
of the legislature of the United States ; and in
beh â¢Â£? f che of humanity to which their
profeflion is closely allied, they thus publicklv
intreat the Congress by their obligations to pro
tect the lives of their constituents, and by their
regard to the character of our nation, and the
rank of our species in the scale of beings, to im-
P nÂ°u f,Utles upon all distilled spirits,
as shall be effectual to restrain their intemperate

Indeed there never has been any affair with the

TREASURY DEPARTMENT,!
December 13, 1790. J
In obedience to the order of the House of Re
presentatives of the 9th Day of August last,
requiring the Secretary of the TrbasurY
to prepare and report, on this Day, such fur
ther Provision as may, in his opinion, be ne
ceflary for eftabliftiing the PUBLIC CREDIT
âthe said Secretary further
Respectfully reports,
THAT from a conviction (as fuggelled in liij Report No. I,
herewith prcfented) thai a National bank is an initiation ot
primary importance to the prosperous admmiftration Â»f the Fi
nances, and would be of the greatcft utility in the operations con
nected with the support of the Public Credit, his attention has
been drawn to devising the plan of such an institution, upon a
scale which will entitle it to the confidence, and be likely to ren
der it equal to the exigencies of the public.
Previously to entering upon the detail of this plan, he entreats
the indulgence of the House, towaids some preliminaiy reflec
tions naturally arising out of the fubjeft, which he hopes will be
deemed neither useless nor out of place. Public opinion being
the ultimate arbiter|ot every measure of government, it can scarcely
appear improper, in deference to that, to accompany the origina
tion of any new proportion with explanations, which the superi
or information ot thofeto whom it is immediately addrelTed,
would render fuperflutras. r j j
It is a fail well understood, that public banks havu found ad
mission and patronage among the principal and most enlightened
commercial nations. They have successively obtained in Italy,
Germany, Holland, England and France, as well as in tÂ£e United
States. And it is a circumftancc which cannot but haveconfider
able weight, in a candid eftimateof their tendency, that after an
experience of centuries, there exists not a question about their
utility in the countries, in which they have been so long establish
ed. Tbeorifls and meu of bufiaefj the acknowledgment
Â° f Trade and induftrv, wherever they have been tried, have been
indebted to them for important aid. And government has been
repeatedly under the greatest obligations to them, in dangerous
and diftreOing emergencies. That of the United States, as well
in some of the most critical conjunctures of the late war, as since
the peace, has received afliftance from those established among us,
With which it could not have difpenftd.
With this two-fold evidence before us, it might be expected,
that there would be a perfect union of opinions in their favor.
Yet doubts have been entertained ; jcaloufies and prejudices have
circulated; and though the experiment is every day dissipating
them, within the fphercs in which effefls are bed known; yet
there are fttil persons by whom they have not been entirely re
nounced. To give a full and accurate view of the fubjeft, would
be to make a treatise of a report; but there are certain afpefts in
which it may be cursorily exhibited, which may perhaps conduce
toajuftimpreffion of its merits. These will involve a comjjari
fon of the advantages, with the disadvantages, real or supposed,
of such institutions.
The following are among the principal advantages of a bank :â
Firjl. The augmentation of the active or produ&ive capital of a
country. Gold and silver, where they are employed merely as
the instruments of exchange and alienation, have been not impro
perly denominated dead flock; but when dcpofited in banks, to
become thebafis of a paper circulation, which takes their charadler
and place, as the signs or representations of value, they then acqui re
life, or, in other words, an active and productive quality. This
idea, which appears rather subtil and abftraft, in a general form,
may be made obvious and palpable, by entering into a lew parti
culars. It iÂ« evident, for instance, that the money which a mer
chant keeps in his chest, waiting for a favorable opportunity to
employ it, produces nothing till that oppottunity arrives. But if
infteafttf locking it up in this manner, he either deposits it in a
invests it in theftock of a bank, it yields a profit during
the interval, in which he partakes, or not, according to the choice
he'may have made of being adepolitor, or a proprietor; and when
any advantageous speculation offers, inorderto be able to embrace
it, he has only to withdraw his money, if a depositor, or if a pro
prietor, to obtain a loan from the bank, orto difpofeof his stock;
an alternative seldom or never attetided with difficulty, when the
affairs of the institution are in a prosperous train. His money thus
or invested, is afund npon which himfelf and others can
borrow to a much larger amount. It is a well established fafl,
that banks in good credit can circulate a far greater sum than the
actual quantum of their capital in gold and silver. The extent of
the poflible excess seems indeterminate ; though it has bc.cu con
je&urally stated at the proportions of two and three to one. This
faculty is produced in various ways. FirjlâA great proportion
of the notes which are issued and pass current as calh, are indefi
nitely suspended in circulation, from the confidence which eech
holder has, that he can at any moment turn them into gold and
silver. Secondly âEvery loan which a bank makes, is, in itsfirft
shape, a credit given to the borrower on its books, the amount of
â which it Hands ready to pay, either in its own notes, or in gold or
silver, at his option. But, in a great number of cases, no actual
payment is madein either. The borrower, frequently,by a check,
or order, transfers his credit to some other perfon,to whom he has
a payment to makeâwho, in his turn, is as often content with
a similar credit, because he is fatisfied that he can, whenever he
pleases, either convert it into cash, or pass it to some other hand
as an equivalent for it. And in this manner the credit keeps cir
culating, performing in every stage the office of money, till it is ex
tinguished by a discount with some person who has a payment to
make to the bank, to an equal or greater amount. Thus large sums
are lent and paid, frequently through a variety of hands, without
the intetvention of a ungle piece of coin. ThirdlyâThere is al
ways a large quantity of gold and silver in the repositories of the
bank, besides its own stock, which is placed there with a view,
partly to its fafe-keeping, and partly to the accommodation of an
institution. which is itfelf a source of general accommodation.
These deposits are of immense consequence in the operations of a
bank. Though liable to be re-drawn at any moment, experi
ence proves, that the money so much oftner changes proprietors
than place, and that what isdr3wnout is generally so speedily
replaced, as to authorize the counting upon the sums deposited,
as an cjfeÂ£iive fund; which concurring with the stock of the bank,
enables it to extend its loans, ?nd to answer all the demands for
coin, whether in consequence ot those loans, or arising from the
occasional returns of its notes.
These different circumftancesexplain the manner in which the
ability of a bank to circulate a greater sum than its actual capita!
in coin, is acquired. This however must be gradual; and rauft
be preceded by a firm establishment of confidence ; a confidence
â¢which taay be bestowed on the irioft rational grounds ; since the
excess in question will always be bottomed on good (ecurity of
one kind or another. This every well-conduÂ£ted bank carefully
requires, before it will consent to advance either its money or its
credit, and where there is an auxiliary capital (as will be the cafe
in the plan hereafter fubmilted) which, together with the capita 7
in coin, define the boundary that (hall not be exceeded by the en
gagementsof the bank, the security may, confidently with a!
the maxims of a reasonable circumfpeftion, be regarded as con
plete.
The famecircumftances illustrate the truth of the position, that
it is one of the properties of banks to increase the a&ive capital of
a country. This, in other words, is the sum of them. The mo
ney of one individual, while he is waiting for an opportunity to
employ it, by being either deposited in the bank for fdfe-keep-
ing, or inverted in its stock, is in a condition to adminifler to the
wants of others, without being put out of his own reach when oc
calion prcfents. This yields an extra profit, arising from what is
paid for the use of his money by others, when he could not him
ielf make use of it ; and keeps the money itfelf in a (late of incess
ant activity. In the almost infinite vicifiitudes and competitions oi
mercantile enterprize, there never can be danger of an iotermif
fion of demand, or that the money will remain for a moment idle
in the vaults of the bank. This additional employment given to
money, and the faculty of a bank to lend and circulate a greater
sum than the amount of its stock in coin, are to all the purposes
of trade and industry an absolute increase of capital. Purchases
and undertakings, in general, can be carried on by any given lum
of bank paper or credit, as effectually as by an equal sum of gold
and silver. And thus by contributing to enlarge the fwafsof in
duftiious and commercial enterprize, banks become nurseries of
national wealth : a consequence, as fatisfaftoiily verified by ex
perience, as it is clearly cleducible in theory.
